a new\nshow that we're producing on\n\n4\n00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:13.767\nWindows Server 101.\n\n5\n00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:17.045\nNow if you're wondering,\nwhat the heck is Windows Server 101 about?\n\n6\n00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:18.052\nThat's a great question.\n\n7\n00:00:18.052 --> 00:00:22.156\nWhat we found out is that there is a\nknowledge gap that you may have if you've\n\n8\n00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:24.590\njust come from studying A+ and Network+.\n\n9\n00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.752\nAnd say, hey,\nI'm about to jump into the MCSA track.\n\n10\n00:00:27.752 --> 00:00:30.204\nBut then you feel\na little bit overwhelmed,\n\n11\n00:00:30.204 --> 00:00:34.790\nbecause there is a ton of knowledge\nright there inside of that MCSA track.\n\n12\n00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.185\nWell, this is going to fill in that gap of\nthe server knowledge that you'll need as\n\n13\n00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:40.660\nyou go in to that training.\n\n14\n00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.975\nAlso, you may be doing\ndesktop support right now in\n\n15\n00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:47.860\nwhich you haven't had any\nreal server experience.\n\n16\n00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.368\nThis show will at least help you get\nsettled and started, and feeling\n\n17\n00:00:51.368 --> 00:00:55.556\ncomfortable in that server knowledge, and\nprovide you the skills that you need.\n\n18\n00:00:55.556 --> 00:01:00.413\nNow this particular show is going to\nbe produced around a book by one of\n\n19\n00:01:00.413 --> 00:01:04.880\nour subject matters that we had\ncome in called Brian Sviderol.\n\n20\n00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.266\nBrian Svidergol wrote a book\ncalled Windows Server 101.\n\n21\n00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.500\nLet me show you what I'm\ntalking about right here.\n\n22\n00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.938\nSo here on my screen, it is an e-book and\n\n23\n00:01:13.938 --> 00:01:17.489\nthe great thing is it will be free for\nyou.\n\n24\n00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:20.476\nSo, Brian has actually released\nthis out into the public.\n\n25\n00:01:20.476 --> 00:01:25.413\nAnd here at ITProTV, we've obtained\npermission to also produce a show\n\n26\n00:01:25.413 --> 00:01:30.620\ngiving the content or surrounding\nthe content of this book as well.\n\n27\n00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.667\nAnd you'll actually see\nright here in his abstract,\n\n28\n00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:38.610\naimed as an introduction to Windows Server\nprovides an overview of administration and\n\n29\n00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.487\nmanagement for Windows Server operating\nsystem without any prerequisite knowledge\n\n30\n00:01:43.487 --> 00:01:46.830\nof Windows Server is necessary and\nthat is the whole goal.\n\n31\n00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.212\nSo if you are actually saying,\nI need to learn more about Windows Server,\n\n32\n00:01:51.212 --> 00:01:52.708\nthis is the show for you.\n\n33\n00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:54.839\nIf you're getting ready\nto take the MCSA or\n\n34\n00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:58.033\nto take that track on, well,\nthis is the show for you as well that\n\n35\n00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:02.520\nwe'll get you comfortable with the\nknowledge and the material that you need.\n\n36\n00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.910\nNow, this particular show though is not\nbased around any particular exam at all.\n\n37\n00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.428\nSo, there are no real\nobjectives that are met.\n\n38\n00:02:10.428 --> 00:02:11.616\nHere at ITProTV,\n\n39\n00:02:11.616 --> 00:02:16.960\nwe wanted to make sure that we gave you\nthe best possible chance at exceeding.\n\n40\n00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.140\nAnd of course, succeeding on\nyour MCSA skills as you move on.\n\n41\n00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.640\nSo, what are some of the things\nthat we'll be covering?\n\n42\n00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.719\nWell, Brian's book is actually divided\nup into five different parts and\n\n43\n00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.970\nthere's actually 24\ndifferent chapters in it.\n\n44\n00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.614\nWe tried to actually produce,\nwell, either a single a show or\n\n45\n00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:39.970\nmultiple shows around those particular\nchapters that will help you out.\n\n46\n00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.325\nSo what you'll actually see in this\nparticular show that's coming up is that\n\n47\n00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:48.613\nyou'll see different episodes based\non just basic server fundamentals and\n\n48\n00:02:48.613 --> 00:02:52.298\nthis is where we get you familiar\nwith Windows Server itself, and\n\n49\n00:02:52.298 --> 00:02:55.380\nunderstanding the functions,\nand the features, and\n\n50\n00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.600\nhow to do a few things that you\nmay not have actually done before.\n\n51\n00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.913\nYou're also of course, going to see the\nidea of networking components that we find\n\n52\n00:03:03.913 --> 00:03:07.750\nin Windows Server itself and we'll\ntalk about some of the details there.\n\n53\n00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.543\nAnd o course,\n\n54\n00:03:08.543 --> 00:03:12.843\nyour basic Network+ knowledge is going\nto be of tremendous help for you as you\n\n55\n00:03:12.843 --> 00:03:18.160\ncontinue to go through those particular\nsections that we'll cover in there.\n\n56\n00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.530\nThen we'll expose you to\nthe basics of Active Directory,\n\n57\n00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.644\ndirectory services as well\nalong with group policy.\n\n58\n00:03:24.644 --> 00:03:28.180\nAnd we'll talk about managing user\naccounts and computer accounts.\n\n59\n00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.784\nWe'll even see the use of group policy and\nhow we actually apply them, and\n\n60\n00:03:32.784 --> 00:03:38.240\nwhere to apply the as well as getting\neverything set up for what we need to do.\n\n61\n00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.650\nWe'll also see in the fourth part.\n\n62\n00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.760\nWe'll see services covered storage\nas well as NTFS permissions.\n\n63\n00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.054\nOne of the big topics that you'll see that\nwill be throughout everything that you'll\n\n64\n00:03:49.054 --> 00:03:52.108\ndo in your MCSA or MCSE track\nas you continue to move forward.\n\n65\n00:03:52.108 --> 00:03:54.606\nSo make sure you do take a look at those,\nas well.\n\n66\n00:03:54.606 --> 00:03:57.414\nAnd then finally, our last section,\n\n67\n00:03:57.414 --> 00:04:02.590\nwe'll be covering file services\nas well as print services.\n\n68\n00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.063\nNow once you actually have that and\neverything is good, that will give\n\n69\n00:04:08.063 --> 00:04:13.905\nyou a solid foundation for, of course,\nyou to proceed on to well deeper and\n\n70\n00:04:13.905 --> 00:04:18.670\nmore advanced topics that you'll\nsee inside MCSA and MCSE.\n\n71\n00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.950\nSo, this will give you at least a broad\nbreadth of knowledge to help you do so.\n\n72\n00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.889\nNow for you to obtain Brian's e-book,\nyou can go out there and\n\n73\n00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.462\nsearch on the internet.\n\n74\n00:04:29.462 --> 00:04:36.538\nUse your favorite browser engine, type in\nBrian Sviderol's name, S-V-I-D-E-R-O-L.\n\n75\n00:04:36.538 --> 00:04:40.634\nI know it's kind of a long name to spell\nout there, but you can actually type in\n\n76\n00:04:40.634 --> 00:04:45.370\nWindows Server 101 and you'll probably\nsee that there'll be a link there.\n\n77\n00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.236\nNow if you're actually an ITProTV member\nthough, you'll also see a link directly to\n\n78\n00:04:50.236 --> 00:04:54.831\nthis particular overview video as well and\nthat will also give you that access and\n\n79\n00:04:54.831 --> 00:04:57.618\nthat chance to be able to\ndownload that book too.\n\n80\n00:04:57.618 --> 00:04:59.982\nNow, this is not a light book.\n\n81\n00:04:59.982 --> 00:05:07.300\nSo even as an overview, it is,\nelectronically about 353 pages.\n\n82\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.890\nSo, you plus or minus about 50 pages for\n\n83\n00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.160\ntable of contents and\nthen some indexing at the end.\n\n84\n00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.250\nBut overall though,\nit's still about 300 pages.\n\n85\n00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.989\nSo, it is a great book.\n\n86\n00:05:17.989 --> 00:05:20.220\nIt's a great base of knowledge.\n\n87\n00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.423\nCombine that along with your own study\nskills, along with the labs that you can\n\n88\n00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:28.768\nactually follow in Brian's book as well\nas labs that we present here at ITProTV.\n\n89\n00:05:28.768 --> 00:05:33.467\nIt will get you prepared for\nwhat you need in Windows Server knowledge.\n\n90\n00:05:33.467 --> 00:05:36.643\nSo if you're ready to proceed,\nmake sure you stay tuned for\n\n91\n00:05:36.643 --> 00:05:38.940\nthe first video following this overview.\n\n",

00:00:08.300\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.615\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRo TV\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\n\n5\n00:00:13.615 --> 00:00:18.401\nepisode right here on ITPRO TV, you're\nwatching the Windows Server 101 show\n\n6\n00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:19.969\n&gt;&gt; I'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:22.742\nAnd today we're taking\na peek into Windows and\n\n8\n00:00:22.742 --> 00:00:26.167\nhere to help us with that is\ngonna be Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:27.351\nCherokee, welcome to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:28.535\n&gt;&gt; Hey Ronnie, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:32.151\n&gt;&gt; It is going well, glad we're\nactually starting this particular show.\n\n12\n00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:33.421\n&gt;&gt; I know, this is a real cool one.\n\n13\n00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:37.730\nDidn't you just finish some shows with Mr.\nBrian Svidergol, did I say that right?\n\n14\n00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.466\n&gt;&gt; Svidergol.\n\n15\n00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.289\n&gt;&gt; And then he gave you a book to use so\n\n16\n00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:43.821\nthat we're gonna be actually\nmapping this series to that book.\n\n17\n00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:46.887\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is actually a very\ninteresting show for us where,\n\n18\n00:00:46.887 --> 00:00:49.474\nwhat we're doing is we're\nkind of filling in the gap.\n\n19\n00:00:49.474 --> 00:00:52.252\nIf you pretty much just finished\nA plus and Network plus and\n\n20\n00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:54.349\nyou don't have any real server knowledge,\n\n21\n00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:58.327\nthis is the one that's gonna give us\nsome practical, hands-on administration.\n\n22\n00:00:58.327 --> 00:01:02.613\nManagement skills as well, to get us\ninvolved in the server right away.\n\n23\n00:01:02.613 --> 00:01:07.360\nAnd Brian Svidergol has really graciously\nprovided this as a resource to\n\n24\n00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.898\nthe ITProTV Members.\n\n25\n00:01:08.898 --> 00:01:12.306\nSo we're glad to be able to\nhave him help us out with that,\n\n26\n00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:14.722\nas well as the exchange show that he did.\n\n27\n00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:17.645\nSo this is a great place for\nus to get started.\n\n28\n00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:21.625\n&gt;&gt; It really is a good place to get\nstarted, Ronnie, because I've hosted shows\n\n29\n00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:25.729\nbefore, when we're looking at a little\nbit more higher level skill sets here,\n\n30\n00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.522\nwhen we are talking about server.\n\n31\n00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:30.562\nSo when you look at the title of\nthis show, we've got Server 101.\n\n32\n00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:34.480\nAnd we really should take a moment\nto define and understand, well,\n\n33\n00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.522\nwhat a server is.\n\n34\n00:01:35.522 --> 00:01:39.277\nSo we think about this concept\nof client versus server.\n\n35\n00:01:39.277 --> 00:01:44.060\nIf you wanna go ahead and take a look\nat my screen we can see that typically\n\n36\n00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.111\na server is going to be a machine offering\nsome type of service to a network.\n\n37\n00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:53.618\nWhereas end users, here we've got laptops,\ndesktops, tablets,\n\n38\n00:01:53.618 --> 00:01:56.194\nall sorts of mobile devices nowadays.\n\n39\n00:01:56.194 --> 00:02:00.955\nBut the operating systems and the machines\nthat the end users are interacting with\n\n40\n00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:04.269\ndirectly, those are gonna be\nyour client side systems.\n\n41\n00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:07.981\nSo this show is really gonna\nbe focusing about our servers.\n\n42\n00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:12.109\nAnd if you take a look at this diagram,\nthis chart over here on the right.\n\n43\n00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:16.141\nAnd so we were just talking about this\nshow does map to Brian's book, and you\n\n44\n00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:20.567\nguys have access to that, so if you wanna\nfollow along this will be perfect for you.\n\n45\n00:02:20.567 --> 00:02:24.919\nAnd here we just see a couple of\ndifferent things such as multiple,\n\n46\n00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.650\nphysical components like CPUs, right?\n\n47\n00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.687\nIn our normal systems, the end user client\nsystems, we typically just have one CPU.\n\n48\n00:02:33.687 --> 00:02:38.307\nSome people out there, hobbyists, they\nmight have more, but on the server side of\n\n49\n00:02:38.307 --> 00:02:42.007\nthings it's rare that we would ever\nsee a server with just one CPU.\n\n50\n00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:45.932\nBecause when we're talking about\nworking in a production environment we\n\n51\n00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.855\nreally can't risk having\nany kind of downtime there.\n\n52\n00:02:48.855 --> 00:02:52.226\nSo hardware,\nwe're always gonna see redundancies.\n\n53\n00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:57.463\nWhen we look at ECC memory, this is even\nanother example of the type of redundancy\n\n54\n00:02:57.463 --> 00:03:02.562\nby utilizing memory that has integrated or\nbuilt-in error correcting code.\n\n55\n00:03:02.562 --> 00:03:06.124\nIt's gonna be more expensive so\nwe typically don't see that on our\n\n56\n00:03:06.124 --> 00:03:09.314\nclient-side systems, but\nservers, it's the way to go.\n\n57\n00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:12.684\nNow, when we talk about optimized for\napplications and\n\n58\n00:03:12.684 --> 00:03:15.120\nthen you think about the little games and\n\n59\n00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.149\nmaybe shopping apps that you may\nuse on your iPad, or your laptop.\n\n60\n00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:23.212\nOur client-side systems really\nare optimized for applications, and\n\n61\n00:03:23.212 --> 00:03:27.693\nthen the work environment you may have\nline of business applications as well.\n\n62\n00:03:27.693 --> 00:03:30.256\nBut servers kind of have\na different stance or\n\n63\n00:03:30.256 --> 00:03:34.168\noutlook on things because you don't\nwanna have all that frivolous or\n\n64\n00:03:34.168 --> 00:03:37.687\nunnecessary components,\nsoftware running on your system.\n\n65\n00:03:37.687 --> 00:03:41.636\nWe'll take a look a little bit later\nabout how security affects servers, but\n\n66\n00:03:41.636 --> 00:03:45.646\nwe really wanna harden them and really\nkeep them as streamlined as possible for\n\n67\n00:03:45.646 --> 00:03:47.607\nsecurity and performance purposes.\n\n68\n00:03:47.607 --> 00:03:51.095\nAnd then lastly,\nwait we've got two more things here.\n\n69\n00:03:51.095 --> 00:03:53.261\nOptimize for background services.\n\n70\n00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:57.080\nSo, client computers, yes there\nare a lot of services that run in\n\n71\n00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.018\nclient-side computers, but servers really\nhave a lot going on behind the scenes.\n\n72\n00:04:02.018 --> 00:04:05.876\nAnd as we continue through this series,\nwe'll take a look at how we can install\n\n73\n00:04:05.876 --> 00:04:09.570\nroles and features, and we'll take\na look at those supporting services.\n\n74\n00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.306\nAnd lastly on our chart here\nwe have hardware redundancies.\n\n75\n00:04:14.306 --> 00:04:17.783\nThat kind of goes with the first one like\nI spoke about with the CPUs because you\n\n76\n00:04:17.783 --> 00:04:19.347\nknow you're looking at servers.\n\n77\n00:04:19.347 --> 00:04:22.373\nYou wanna have multiple\nnetwork interface cards,\n\n78\n00:04:22.373 --> 00:04:24.845\nyou wanna have multiple power supplies.\n\n79\n00:04:24.845 --> 00:04:29.192\nWhereas we really don't see that on the\nclient desktop side of things, laptops or\n\n80\n00:04:29.192 --> 00:04:30.526\nwhatever we have there.\n\n81\n00:04:30.526 --> 00:04:33.152\nSo that's just kind of\na brief description, and\n\n82\n00:04:33.152 --> 00:04:36.813\nknowing the difference between\nclient-side versus server side.\n\n83\n00:04:36.813 --> 00:04:40.378\n&gt;&gt; Now, Cherokee, that makes a lot of\nsense, when we really get started in\n\n84\n00:04:40.378 --> 00:04:43.138\ntrying to differentiate\nbetween a client and a server.\n\n85\n00:04:43.138 --> 00:04:46.874\nWhat we're looking for, in server\nknowledge of course is that ability to\n\n86\n00:04:46.874 --> 00:04:49.766\nsay hey, servers are really\ndesigned to handle, well,\n\n87\n00:04:49.766 --> 00:04:52.175\nmore than just one human\ninteraction at a time,\n\n88\n00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:55.693\nwhereas we're normally sitting\nbehind the client desktop as well.\n\n89\n00:04:55.693 --> 00:04:59.905\nSo being able to provide redundancies,\nbeing able to actually have the power that\n\n90\n00:04:59.905 --> 00:05:04.178\nwe're talking about and things operating\nthe background really lend itself to not\n\n91\n00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:07.191\nreally being optimized for\nthat individual user so much.\n\n92\n00:05:07.191 --> 00:05:11.432\nBut as much as actually being able to\nconfigure that one machine, get it up and\n\n93\n00:05:11.432 --> 00:05:15.234\noperating, and then letting it do\nthe job that it really needs to do.\n\n94\n00:05:15.234 --> 00:05:17.229\nSo Cherokee,\nwhere are we gonna go from here?\n\n95\n00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.397\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, I thought we would start\nat the beginning with an installation.\n\n96\n00:05:20.397 --> 00:05:24.180\nSo, what I have access to, and\nif we take a look at my screen right here,\n\n97\n00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.896\nyou have access to this as well.\n\n98\n00:05:25.896 --> 00:05:27.266\nThis is gonna be our practice labs.\n\n99\n00:05:27.266 --> 00:05:31.405\nNow, Brian has done a really great job\nof integrating labs throughout his book.\n\n100\n00:05:31.405 --> 00:05:35.277\nBut you guys also have your practice\nlabs available to you as well.\n\n101\n00:05:35.277 --> 00:05:40.070\nSo what we're gonna do Instead of me\nhaving a server sitting here on the desk,\n\n102\n00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.432\nwe're gonna be utilizing Hyper-V,\n\n103\n00:05:42.432 --> 00:05:46.446\na virtualization technology to\nemulate an installation here.\n\n104\n00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:48.394\nSo we're looking at Server Manager here.\n\n105\n00:05:48.394 --> 00:05:53.176\nAnd if I go down to the drop-down menu and\nselect Tools, and over here,\n\n106\n00:05:53.176 --> 00:05:57.657\nif I can kind of zoom in for you,\nyou're gonna see HyperV Manager.\n\n107\n00:05:57.657 --> 00:06:03.609\nAnd what we'll be doing,\nif I can get it over there, all right.\n\n108\n00:06:03.609 --> 00:06:07.475\nWhat we're gonna be doing is\nselecting HyperV Manager,\n\n109\n00:06:07.475 --> 00:06:11.107\nagain just to emulate\na physical installation here.\n\n110\n00:06:11.107 --> 00:06:13.443\nSo we'll pull that up.\n\n111\n00:06:13.443 --> 00:06:18.099\nI'm going to select the machine that\nI want from the list of available\n\n112\n00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:22.851\nvirtual machines that have been\nprestaged within this environment.\n\n113\n00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:28.710\nSo, this machine right here, PALBSA02,\nif I can zoom in a little bit for\n\n114\n00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.899\nyou we just right-click,\nand then select Connect.\n\n115\n00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:35.941\nNow I haven't actually\npowered on the device yet, so\n\n116\n00:06:35.941 --> 00:06:37.774\nthat's what we need to do here.\n\n117\n00:06:37.774 --> 00:06:42.613\nAnd by selecting this green button,\nthe power button, you're essentially\n\n118\n00:06:42.613 --> 00:06:47.310\npoking that physical machine,\nturning it on, bringing this machine up.\n\n119\n00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.905\nSo go ahead wait for\nthis machine to get started here.\n\n120\n00:06:50.905 --> 00:06:55.353\nAnd the installation is\nactually pretty easy.\n\n121\n00:06:55.353 --> 00:06:59.615\nThere's not a whole lot, it's pretty\nintuitive as far as using the GUI,\n\n122\n00:06:59.615 --> 00:07:01.145\nwhich we're doing here.\n\n123\n00:07:01.145 --> 00:07:07.611\nYou also have another option,\nto go ahead and install via PowerShell,\n\n124\n00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:14.425\nwhich we'll get to in a few chapters here,\nbut we're not quite there yet.\n\n125\n00:07:14.425 --> 00:07:17.070\nJust making it full screen so\nwe can see everything.\n\n126\n00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.439\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, basically at this\npoint, in terms of a server install,\n\n127\n00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:24.049\nthere's really not a lot\nof difference until we\n\n128\n00:07:24.049 --> 00:07:27.854\nget to that first screen where\nwe'll see some information, right?\n\n129\n00:07:27.854 --> 00:07:29.443\nOr first or second screen.\n\n130\n00:07:29.443 --> 00:07:32.718\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you've ever installed\nan operating system before, or\n\n131\n00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:36.106\nmaybe you haven't, I mean,\ndon't be worried, don't be afraid to,\n\n132\n00:07:36.106 --> 00:07:37.813\nyou have the lab environment here.\n\n133\n00:07:37.813 --> 00:07:40.586\nYou can also, I'll show you where\nyou can obtain the files for\n\n134\n00:07:40.586 --> 00:07:43.690\nyou to be able to download it and\nset up your own virtual environment.\n\n135\n00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.226\nSo it's not difficult in that aspect.\n\n136\n00:07:45.226 --> 00:07:47.227\nYou'll see, It only takes a few minutes.\n\n137\n00:07:47.227 --> 00:07:51.810\nSo, this first screen that pops up,\nit's just asking what language, and\n\n138\n00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.172\nif I can even speak English, this is\ngonna be the language that I use, so\n\n139\n00:07:56.172 --> 00:07:59.271\nthat's what I'm gonna\nkeep here as the default.\n\n140\n00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:01.432\nTime and currency format.\n\n141\n00:08:01.432 --> 00:08:05.544\nIt's important just to make sure that you\ndo pay attention to make sure everything\n\n142\n00:08:05.544 --> 00:08:06.450\nis correct here.\n\n143\n00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.978\nSo everything looks good to me,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n144\n00:08:09.978 --> 00:08:12.035\nkeep this as United States format and\nwe'll hit next.\n\n145\n00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:16.398\nAnd, well,\n\n146\n00:08:16.398 --> 00:08:21.470\nlooking at this screen here doesn't\nreally leave much to the imagination.\n\n147\n00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.633\nWe'll just go ahead and\nselect Install Now.\n\n148\n00:08:23.633 --> 00:08:26.334\nI will note that over in\nthe bottom left-hand corner here,\n\n149\n00:08:26.334 --> 00:08:28.990\nyou'll see this section that\nsays Repair Your Computer.\n\n150\n00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.262\nSo you do have some\nrepair tools available.\n\n151\n00:08:31.262 --> 00:08:35.050\nYou can even restart the computer\nfrom this option as well.\n\n152\n00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:38.411\nBut we're gonna go ahead and proceed with\nthe install, and we'll select Install Now.\n\n153\n00:08:43.332 --> 00:08:46.069\nBecause I am working in this\nvirtualized environment,\n\n154\n00:08:46.069 --> 00:08:49.950\nthere may be a little bit of latency,\nyou might see a little bit of delay.\n\n155\n00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.232\nYou probably wouldn't\nhave as much of that,\n\n156\n00:08:52.232 --> 00:08:54.401\nif you were working on physical hardware.\n\n157\n00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:55.677\nSo by default, so\n\n158\n00:08:55.677 --> 00:09:01.210\nMicrosoft has this concept where they\nreally want to integrate security.\n\n159\n00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.760\nAnd the default installation,\n\n160\n00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.930\nespecially in a production environment\nis gonna be core installation.\n\n161\n00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.130\nSo, core versus GUI,\nI mentioned earlier about,\n\n162\n00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.550\nwe really wanna streamline and\nreduce the footprint.\n\n163\n00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:15.040\nWe talk about security,\nwe talk about power consumption.\n\n164\n00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.179\nAnd a core operating system\nwill give us all of that.\n\n165\n00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:21.840\nBut for this demonstration, we wanna\nkeep our graphical user interface.\n\n166\n00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.400\nSo we have a couple of\ndifferent options here.\n\n167\n00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.030\nAnd we'll talk about these in a moment.\n\n168\n00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.330\nBut I've got standard versus data center.\n\n169\n00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.580\nIt really comes down to licensing and\npricing.\n\n170\n00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.380\nSo right now, I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n171\n00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.320\nselect Standard with\nthe desktop experience.\n\n172\n00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.580\nSo this is gonna provide us\nthat graphical user interface.\n\n173\n00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.820\nAnd, we'll just hit Next, and sorry\nmy screen keeps bouncing around here.\n\n174\n00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.490\nI'll have to take a look at that.\n\n175\n00:09:46.175 --> 00:09:49.105\nNow, this is kind of interesting screen,\nbasically is\n\n176\n00:09:49.105 --> 00:09:51.985\nletting you know you have your EULA,\nyour End User License Agreement.\n\n177\n00:09:51.985 --> 00:09:55.975\nYou can either agree to the terms, or\nwell don't install the piece of software.\n\n178\n00:09:55.975 --> 00:09:58.608\nSo, we'll go ahead and agree and hit Next.\n\n179\n00:10:03.274 --> 00:10:07.545\nWhen we get to this screen, you have the\noption to go ahead and perform an upgrade.\n\n180\n00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.920\nIn my opinion,\nI typically use a custom installation.\n\n181\n00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.880\nAnd that's what we're gonna do here.\n\n182\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.190\nNice, clean install.\n\n183\n00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:20.640\nNow, when we get to this screen,\nwe have a couple options.\n\n184\n00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.621\nThis is my hard drive,\nand I have 127 gigs.\n\n185\n00:10:23.621 --> 00:10:26.432\nAnd so,\nwhen we're talking about virtualization,\n\n186\n00:10:26.432 --> 00:10:30.440\nwe have to think about the hardware\nthat has been allocated to this machine.\n\n187\n00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.670\nBut if you have a physical machine,\nthis total size here would acquaint to\n\n188\n00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:39.035\nthe amount of hard drive space that is\ninstalled into that physical machine.\n\n189\n00:10:39.035 --> 00:10:43.297\nNow in the past, people,\nadmins may even want to segment or\n\n190\n00:10:43.297 --> 00:10:48.941\npartition that hard drive, so they could\nhave maybe a partition for storage.\n\n191\n00:10:48.941 --> 00:10:50.832\nSo that, if the Operating System,\n\n192\n00:10:50.832 --> 00:10:55.246\nthe partition with the bootable operating\nsystem became corrupt for any reason and\n\n193\n00:10:55.246 --> 00:10:58.080\nwe had to re-install\nthat operating system.\n\n194\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:03.000\nTheir other partition, which house\nthose files, would still remain intact,\n\n195\n00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.740\nuntouched, unscathed.\n\n196\n00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.970\nWith the advent of cloud computing,\nwe have network-attached storage,\n\n197\n00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.230\nstorage area networks.\n\n198\n00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.361\nWe have so\nmany alternative options nowadays,\n\n199\n00:11:13.361 --> 00:11:16.503\nthat we normally have\ndedicated file servers.\n\n200\n00:11:16.503 --> 00:11:19.397\nAnd, a lot of people will just\nkeep the single partition,\n\n201\n00:11:19.397 --> 00:11:21.121\nmaybe have a recovery partition.\n\n202\n00:11:21.121 --> 00:11:24.331\nBut for now, I'm just gonna go ahead and\nleave it as is, and\n\n203\n00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:28.200\nyou also have the option to delete,\nextend, reformat.\n\n204\n00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.710\nIf you choose to do so, but because this\nis a clean install, I'm good to go and\n\n205\n00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:32.526\nwe'll hit Next.\n\n206\n00:11:38.009 --> 00:11:43.291\nNow this is gonna take a few minutes,\nand what will happen is,\n\n207\n00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:48.285\nbecause this system has been\nset to boot to a drive.\n\n208\n00:11:48.285 --> 00:11:52.297\nThe next screen that you'll see after,\nhopefully, after all the installation has\n\n209\n00:11:52.297 --> 00:11:56.213\nbeen successful, it'll be a black screen\nthat says to press any key to continue.\n\n210\n00:11:56.213 --> 00:11:58.195\nNumber one, there is no any key.\n\n211\n00:11:58.195 --> 00:12:02.267\nNumber two don't press any key unless you\nwanna walk through every single one of\n\n212\n00:12:02.267 --> 00:12:03.802\nthose steps that we just did.\n\n213\n00:12:03.802 --> 00:12:06.070\nSo, that's just about it.\n\n214\n00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.900\nThere is some post installation\nconfiguration that we will look at in\n\n215\n00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.680\nthe next show coming up here,\nbut it's really just that easy.\n\n216\n00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.854\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, Cherokee,\nonce we actually get the install done,\n\n217\n00:12:19.854 --> 00:12:22.336\nwhich we'll finish in\njust a few minutes here.\n\n218\n00:12:22.336 --> 00:12:25.875\nWe also need to talk about\nthe idea of hardware,\n\n219\n00:12:25.875 --> 00:12:29.510\nas well as software,\nin our server 101 here.\n\n220\n00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.990\nSo where are we heading next?\n\n221\n00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:36.867\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Ronnie, so historically, when\nwe talk about hardware versus software,\n\n222\n00:12:36.867 --> 00:12:38.928\nit really was hardware-driven.\n\n223\n00:12:38.928 --> 00:12:42.042\nSome of you may have been coming\nright off of A Plus studying on all\n\n224\n00:12:42.042 --> 00:12:44.821\nthe different components,\nwhich is really important.\n\n225\n00:12:44.821 --> 00:12:48.353\nThere's been a significant shift in,\n\n226\n00:12:48.353 --> 00:12:53.860\nI guess weighted shift more\ntowards software, nowadays.\n\n227\n00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.530\nBut it is important to start,\nstart with the hardware in my opinion.\n\n228\n00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:02.096\nSo, if we take a look at my screen we\ncan follow up Microsoft to recommence.\n\n229\n00:13:02.096 --> 00:13:05.681\nThey have some system requirements that\nare pretty important to go ahead and\n\n230\n00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:06.640\ntake a look at here.\n\n231\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.130\nWhen we're talking about different\nversions of the Operating System,\n\n232\n00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:11.490\nwhich we can just go ahead and\n\n233\n00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:16.100\nmention, because it is directly\nassociated with hardware, as well.\n\n234\n00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.900\nSo, a few moments ago,\nyou saw the option to be able to have\n\n235\n00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.530\na standard edition versus\ndata center edition.\n\n236\n00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:27.760\nThose are gonna be our pretty beefy,\nour hefty operating systems there,\n\n237\n00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.780\nin the sense that they're to be\nused in a production environment.\n\n238\n00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:35.710\nWe do have a couple different,\nwe have a Centrals, which is going to be\n\n239\n00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:39.830\na server addition, but I wouldn't\nrecommend it for more than 25 users.\n\n240\n00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.830\nIt's more of a lightweight\noperating system.\n\n241\n00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.790\nAnd then, something that's pretty\ncool that came out in Server 2016 is\n\n242\n00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.827\nsomething called nano-server.\n\n243\n00:13:48.827 --> 00:13:53.300\nAnd nano-server is going to be an even\nmore slimmed down version of that\n\n244\n00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.695\noperating system.\n\n245\n00:13:54.695 --> 00:14:00.300\nSo,when we talk about GUI versus Core,\nso GUI provides us with that entire\n\n246\n00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.880\ngraphical user interface, the windows\nthat we can click and interact with.\n\n247\n00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.230\nWhen we look at Server Core,\n\n248\n00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.280\nwe're really dealing with\na command line based interface.\n\n249\n00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.140\nSo, all additional coding\nhas been removed and\n\n250\n00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.430\nstripped down to provide us\nwith that core installation.\n\n251\n00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:16.965\nBut if we take a look at nano,\n\n252\n00:14:16.965 --> 00:14:22.270\nwhereas nano,\nit's an even more slim down installation.\n\n253\n00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.570\nAs a matter of fact,\nMicrosoft calls it head list,\n\n254\n00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:28.360\nwhich means that you can't\ndirectly log on to nano server.\n\n255\n00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.750\nAnd if you look at the boot time, I wanna\nsay it's like nine seconds to boot.\n\n256\n00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.080\nYou do have some reduced services though.\n\n257\n00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.580\nIt went from 42 dropped down to 28.\n\n258\n00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:41.640\nAnd then also,\nyou have 12 open ports versus 27.\n\n259\n00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.640\nSo you'll hear the term Just Enough OS.\n\n260\n00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.150\nSo Just Enough OS meaning,\nit still provides network services,\n\n261\n00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.610\nthey recommend it for DNS servers.\n\n262\n00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:55.350\nYou can still use them in clustering,\ngreat for a virtualization environment,\n\n263\n00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.880\nbut just a tiny little footprint there.\n\n264\n00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:02.104\nSo, installing Nanos is gonna be slightly\ndifferent, and I have the links for\n\n265\n00:15:02.104 --> 00:15:03.710\nyou guys here in the notes.\n\n266\n00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.290\nYou can go ahead and utilize.\n\n267\n00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.890\nThey have an installation\ntool available for that.\n\n268\n00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.886\nMicrosoft does a great job with\nall the installation information,\n\n269\n00:15:12.886 --> 00:15:15.242\nif you ever need any\nof that to back it up.\n\n270\n00:15:15.242 --> 00:15:21.004\nAnd, just looking at where we\nobtained this installation as well,\n\n271\n00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:22.870\nwhat we just did.\n\n272\n00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:26.570\nYou guys can hop onto the internet,\nlinks are in the show notes, and\n\n273\n00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:31.560\ndownload a free evaluation of\nWindows Server 2016 for 180 days.\n\n274\n00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:37.340\nIf you wanted to try Core Out, or\nyou could just use that pre-compiled\n\n275\n00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:41.430\nlab environment with practice labs that\nwe have available for you, as well.\n\n276\n00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:45.800\nSo, when we take a look, let me go back to\nthe system requirements for the hardware.\n\n277\n00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.025\nSo a few things to note here.\n\n278\n00:15:48.025 --> 00:15:51.786\nLet's go ahead and take a look at\nthe processor or the CPU first.\n\n279\n00:15:51.786 --> 00:15:56.550\nSo, You do have some minimums that we\nneed to take in to consideration here.\n\n280\n00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.812\nAnd I will say, it's very important\nto heed the system requirements that\n\n281\n00:16:00.812 --> 00:16:05.912\nMicrosoft does provide, especially if you\nplan on using in a production environment.\n\n282\n00:16:05.912 --> 00:16:09.108\nLab environment, testing environment,\nthat's a little bit different especially\n\n283\n00:16:09.108 --> 00:16:11.315\nif you're not gonna be\nweighing that system down.\n\n284\n00:16:11.315 --> 00:16:13.100\nBut you always wanna stick to,\n\n285\n00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.510\nwhen they say minimum they\nreally do mean minimum here.\n\n286\n00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:20.311\nSo a couple interesting things though,\nyou need at least a 1.4 gigahertz,\n\n287\n00:16:20.311 --> 00:16:22.050\n64 bit processor.\n\n288\n00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:26.600\nI think it was with 2012,\nit might have been 2008.\n\n289\n00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.940\nBut they really just dropped\nthe 32 bit architecture for\n\n290\n00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.140\nthe server side operating systems.\n\n291\n00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.648\nSo we definitely need that 64,\nthat x86 support there.\n\n292\n00:16:36.648 --> 00:16:44.490\nNow when the processor here,\nwe have support in x and DEP.\n\n293\n00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:49.050\nSo in x is going to be never execute or\nno execute,\n\n294\n00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:54.210\nwhich is going to be a variation of\nan integrated anti-malware technology.\n\n295\n00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:58.240\nAnd DEP, Data Execution Prevention,\nis essentially the same thing.\n\n296\n00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:05.510\nNow if we look at Intel's Processors that\nare labeled VT for Virtual Technology.\n\n297\n00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:10.170\nThey usually support these features\nstarting around 2006 and above.\n\n298\n00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.800\nSo if you're kind of questioning,\nif you have an older processor,\n\n299\n00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.450\nyou might wanna take a look at that first,\njust as far as planning goes.\n\n300\n00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:22.390\nThere are a couple other requirements\nas well such as pre-fetch and\n\n301\n00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.350\nyou might wanna look at for\n\n302\n00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:29.090\na second level address translation slot\nto support as well for your processor.\n\n303\n00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:32.240\nAnd really, in production environments\nespecially if you're gonna be using\n\n304\n00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.350\nanything like virtualization,\nit's always good to have,\n\n305\n00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:43.340\nI guess as much as your budget can handle\nthere would be the best way to put it.\n\n306\n00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.020\nAnother thing for RAM.\n\n307\n00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.460\nNow this is kind of funny here.\n\n308\n00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:53.100\nSo they have 512 megabytes, 2 GB for\nserver with desktop experience.\n\n309\n00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.000\nSo that's your GUI.\n\n310\n00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.910\nThat's your Graphical User Interface.\n\n311\n00:17:55.910 --> 00:18:01.260\nBut even just taking a look at NANO\nthey recommend like 500 megabytes,\n\n312\n00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:05.100\nso you have less requirements\nwhen we're talking a look at\n\n313\n00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.800\nthose command line interfaces, and\nyou wanna be aware of that too.\n\n314\n00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.460\nAnd also if you play it again, we really\ndon't spend too much time talking about\n\n315\n00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:16.805\nvirtualization in this show, but that is\na consideration if you're gonna be running\n\n316\n00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:19.450\nHyper-V on that system and\nyou're gonna be adding machines.\n\n317\n00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:22.230\nYou can only allocate what\nyou have physically, so\n\n318\n00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.770\nyou have to keep that in mind as well.\n\n319\n00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.190\nStorage space.\n\n320\n00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.780\nStorage space,\nwe've seen storage prices go down, or\n\n321\n00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:34.330\noperating systems now requiring\na minimum of 32 GB of storage here.\n\n322\n00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:40.350\nAnd it says, be aware that 32 GB should be\nconsidered an absolute minimum value for\n\n323\n00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:44.110\nsuccessful installation,\nand then it continues.\n\n324\n00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:49.250\nThis is kind of common sense here, but\nobviously the more server roles, the more\n\n325\n00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:53.130\nfeatures that you're gonna be adding and\nreally asking that server to provide you,\n\n326\n00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.160\nyou're gonna need to have additional\nstorage to support that as well.\n\n327\n00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.970\nAnd then if we take a look at our\nnetwork adapter requirements, all right?\n\n328\n00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:07.110\nThe minimum, okay, so\nI don't really know why in a production\n\n329\n00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.940\nenvironment someone would have a system\nwithout the inability to connect.\n\n330\n00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.750\nBecause in computing that's really what\nwe're trying to achieve most of the time,\n\n331\n00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:19.360\nbut here we wanna have an Ethernet adapter\ncapable of at least a gigabit throughput.\n\n332\n00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:23.630\nYou want compliant with\nthe PCIE Express Architecture, so\n\n333\n00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.020\nwe need to at least be at that level.\n\n334\n00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.845\nAnd you also wanna be able\nto support PXE Boot, so\n\n335\n00:19:28.845 --> 00:19:34.730\nPre-Boot Execution Environments for\nyour network interface card here.\n\n336\n00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:39.086\nAnd Although it's not required, in\na production environment it is preferred\n\n337\n00:19:39.086 --> 00:19:43.574\nto have multiple network interface cards\nfor redundancy, load balancing, and\n\n338\n00:19:43.574 --> 00:19:47.813\nif you don't know what I am talking about,\nno worries, we'll get to that.\n\n339\n00:19:47.813 --> 00:19:52.506\nAnd then of course there are other\nrequirements such as DVD drives if you're\n\n340\n00:19:52.506 --> 00:19:56.850\nplanning on installing that system\nfrom an actual physical DVD or CD.\n\n341\n00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:02.415\nBut I think that's about it to go\nahead and start to get going here.\n\n342\n00:20:02.415 --> 00:20:06.022\nAnd like I said, NANO install is\ngonna be a little bit different, so\n\n343\n00:20:06.022 --> 00:20:08.690\nthere is specific documentation for that.\n\n344\n00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.490\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\nnow that we've got a lot of information,\n\n345\n00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.430\nwhat are you gonna show us here?\n\n346\n00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.720\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so Ronnie I did want to\nshow you something specifically\n\n347\n00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.560\nthat Brian had called out in the book.\n\n348\n00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.220\nIf we take a look at my machine.\n\n349\n00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.290\nWe can expand upon the concept\non memory a little bit further.\n\n350\n00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.964\nSo I'm just gonna select one of\nthese pre-staged virtual machines,\n\n351\n00:20:27.964 --> 00:20:30.630\nright-click and select Settings.\n\n352\n00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:34.010\nSo if you're not familiar with\na virtual environment and\n\n353\n00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:38.330\nusing Hyper-V,\nI just wanted to show you something here.\n\n354\n00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:43.210\nNow what we're looking at this is\nan example of where I would go\n\n355\n00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:48.190\nto allocate my hardware resources\nto my individual virtual machines.\n\n356\n00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.352\nSo let's take a look here at memory,\nbecause Brian specifically calls out\n\n357\n00:20:51.352 --> 00:20:53.674\ndifferent types of memory\nwhich is important to know.\n\n358\n00:20:53.674 --> 00:21:00.385\nSo I can specify a specific amount of\nRAM noted here, all right, in megabytes.\n\n359\n00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:05.249\nSo we've got about 1.5 GB of RAM allocated\nto this particular machine here.\n\n360\n00:21:05.249 --> 00:21:09.780\nIf I enable dynamic memory which is\na cool feature, I can go ahead and\n\n361\n00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.436\nset the minimum amount of RMA\nversus the maximum amount\n\n362\n00:21:13.436 --> 00:21:18.390\nof RAM that I will allow this virtual\nmachine at any given time to utilize.\n\n363\n00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:22.090\nIt has to fall within that upper and\nlower control limits there.\n\n364\n00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.220\nSo here I set my minimum at 512.\n\n365\n00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.050\nAnd if you recall a few seconds ago,\n\n366\n00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:31.198\nwhen we looked at the website to the\nsystem requirements provided by Microsoft,\n\n367\n00:21:31.198 --> 00:21:34.138\nthey said, look these are your\nabsolute minimums here.\n\n368\n00:21:34.138 --> 00:21:36.580\nSo we really don't wanna\ndeviate from that.\n\n369\n00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.490\nWe need to at least have\nthose minimums there.\n\n370\n00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:44.530\nAnd maximum RAM, if your system\ncould support it, then go for it.\n\n371\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.910\nBut there is also something else\nto consider, because you may have,\n\n372\n00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.950\nlike I have here,\nmultiple virtual machines running.\n\n373\n00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.890\nSo you could also set a memory wait here.\n\n374\n00:21:54.890 --> 00:22:01.210\nSo over to the left is going to give\na lower priority to this virtual machine.\n\n375\n00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:04.000\nHowever if I slide this scale\nall the way to the right,\n\n376\n00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.330\nit's gonna set this machine with a higher\npriority, which means if there is\n\n377\n00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:12.920\nadditional memory available, then it's\ngonna be giving it to this machine first.\n\n378\n00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.110\nAnd also we see the memory\nbuffer is gonna be set at 20%,\n\n379\n00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.880\nand you also wanna keep in\nmind paging files there.\n\n380\n00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.650\nWhich we'll probably talk about\na little bit more when we dive\n\n381\n00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.460\ndeeper into our hardware components.\n\n382\n00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.870\nBut I think for now, this is a good start\nwhen we start thinking about hardware.\n\n383\n00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:33.150\nAnd we'll need to kind of take a shift and\nlook at software.\n\n384\n00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:35.090\nBut I do think we are out of time.\n\n385\n00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.010\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n386\n00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:42.060\nWell thank you again Cherokee, for\nhelping us to take a peek into Windows and\n\n387\n00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.940\nshowing us the beginning\nof the installation.\n\n388\n00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.990\nWe'll see that of course in\na part two as we continue on\n\n389\n00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.740\nwith this peek into Windows,\nbut Cherokee's right.\n\n390\n00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.420\nThis is a great place for\nus to take the time to sign off.\n\n391\n00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.898\nSo for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong\n\n392\n00:22:55.898 --> 00:22:56.943\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n393\n00:22:56.943 --> 00:23:00.206\n&gt;&gt; Stay tune for more Server 101\n\n394\n00:23:00.206 -->

00:00:12.660\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.290\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.010\nYou're watching the Windows\nserver 101 show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.960\n&gt;&gt; I'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\nwe're taking a look at a peek into Windows\n\n7\n00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.950\npart two, where we're about to\ntalk about some of the software.\n\n8\n00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.260\nWe've already covered some of\nthe hardware side inside of the part one.\n\n9\n00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.050\nNow, we're actually gonna take a look\nat the other side here with Ms.\n\n10\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.920\nCherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.190\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.310\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.250\nYeah, we definitely took a look at\nour different types of hardware.\n\n14\n00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.780\nAnd so we're now kind of taking a shift\nand we'll be looking at software.\n\n15\n00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.220\nSo, software's going to be\nthe coding aspect of it.\n\n16\n00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.680\nSo the first thing I wanna talk\nabout is going to be the kernel, and\n\n17\n00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.350\nthe kernel is the low level portion of\nthe operating system that really keeps\n\n18\n00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.038\nWindows running behind the scenes.\n\n19\n00:00:56.038 --> 00:01:00.210\nSo we talk about our hardware abstraction\nlayer, we'll be talking about drivers.\n\n20\n00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.380\nBut just knowing that we're starting\nthere at that low level and\n\n21\n00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.030\nthen we'll be talking about other\nsupporting components as well.\n\n22\n00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.898\nThe next thing he wants us to\ncall out is system processes.\n\n23\n00:01:09.898 --> 00:01:12.190\nSo there are certain\nprocesses that the system,\n\n24\n00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.850\nthe operating system, needs in order\nto stay functioning and running.\n\n25\n00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.720\nSo a lot of times we'll see different\ncomponents of the operating system\n\n26\n00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.070\nhidden so that someone doesn't\naccidentally delete them or\n\n27\n00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.890\nmodify them and\ncorrupt them in any kind of way.\n\n28\n00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.190\nAnd we also want to take\na look at services.\n\n29\n00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.820\nJust like with your client side systems,\nyour servers have services as well.\n\n30\n00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.760\nSo if we can take a look\nat my screen real quick,\n\n31\n00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.080\nI'd like to show you a shortcut,\nor quick way just to go ahead.\n\n32\n00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.920\nAnd if you utilize your run command,\nand you could also, if you're in\n\n33\n00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.660\nfront of a system with a keyboard there,\nuse your Windows-r shortcut.\n\n34\n00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.120\nBut because I'm working in this virtual\nenvironment, I'm going to go ahead and\n\n35\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.990\nselect run, and\nthen just type in services.msc.\n\n36\n00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.060\nWell, look, it's already in there.\n\n37\n00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.560\nAnd if I can navigate for you guys,\nyou can see that it's in the Run line,\n\n38\n00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.590\nwe'll hit Enter and this'll bring up\nour services page, our Services window.\n\n39\n00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.100\nQuite a lot of different\nservices we have going on here,\n\n40\n00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.269\nif I can zoom out a little bit for you.\n\n41\n00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.140\nOops, other way.\n\n42\n00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.510\nAnd let's see, move it around.\n\n43\n00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.220\nThis is also going to be\nwhere you would wanna go and\n\n44\n00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.150\nsee which services are running,\nbecause in this column right here,\n\n45\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.120\nwe can see the actual status of\nthe services, running or not.\n\n46\n00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.830\nYou do wanna check to make sure before\nyou just, we don't recommend randomly or\n\n47\n00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.630\nhaphazardly stopping and restarting\na service because you have different\n\n48\n00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.420\napplications and different components\nthat rely on these services.\n\n49\n00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.580\nSometimes they'll stop or stop\nfunctioning, and you may need to stop and\n\n50\n00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.750\nrestart them.\n\n51\n00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.860\nAnd you just simply right-click, and\nthis one's selected as disabled.\n\n52\n00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.450\nBut in this portion right here,\nyou can see that it's grayed out.\n\n53\n00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.050\nYou would simply just select start or\nstop.\n\n54\n00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.020\nYou can pause and resume.\n\n55\n00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.500\nBut that's going to be the portion there\nwhere we take a look at our services.\n\n56\n00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.210\nA couple other things that we need to\nmention when we're talking about our\n\n57\n00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.780\nsoftware would be our applications.\n\n58\n00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.760\nNow it's kind of interesting,\nwhen I first started working in IT,\n\n59\n00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.850\nwe always called software\nprograms programs.\n\n60\n00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.240\nAnd a lot of days now you'll hear\nthis term applications, apps.\n\n61\n00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.790\nSo applications are gonna be any kind of\npiece of software that are servicing,\n\n62\n00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.970\nusually third party, but\napplications can also be integrated.\n\n63\n00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.261\nYou got a Windows store and\n\n64\n00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:28.702\ndifferent various resources in\nwhich you can obtain applications.\n\n65\n00:03:28.702 --> 00:03:30.106\nFirmware.\n\n66\n00:03:30.106 --> 00:03:35.164\nFirmware is kind of a funny one because\nfirmware is in between hardware and\n\n67\n00:03:35.164 --> 00:03:35.770\nsoftware.\n\n68\n00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.770\nIt's almost like a translator,\nif you will, between the two.\n\n69\n00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.710\nSo, your firmware is telling\n\n70\n00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.500\nthe operating system how to communicate\nwith your hardware and visa-versa.\n\n71\n00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.390\nSo your firmware can be up to date,\nyour manufacturers for\n\n72\n00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.140\nyour hardware equipments can release\nfirmware updates, and it's a good idea to\n\n73\n00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.390\nkeep those up to date because they're\nnormally gonna be releasing updates to\n\n74\n00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.830\novercome any kind of security breaches or\nany bug fixes that they may have.\n\n75\n00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.930\nAnd another thing we need to\nconsider is going to be drivers.\n\n76\n00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.245\nSo, if you're working on\na client side system,\n\n77\n00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:15.325\nyou have the option of running a 32-bit or\n64-bit operating system.\n\n78\n00:04:15.325 --> 00:04:19.685\nSo when we look at our sever operating\nsystems, those are all gonna 64-bit.\n\n79\n00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:24.590\nHowever, keep in mind there may be\nsome situations in your environment\n\n80\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.750\nwhere you are servicing drivers to\nclients on 32-bit operating systems.\n\n81\n00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.190\nFor instance,\nif you have a print server set up,\n\n82\n00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.920\nyou may need to consider installing\n32-bit drivers on that print server.\n\n83\n00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.010\nSo you just kinda have to modify or\n\n84\n00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.500\nchange the way that you think whenever\nyou're setting up an entire network or\n\n85\n00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.075\nservers to these servers and you are not\njust dealing with just one client here.\n\n86\n00:04:49.075 --> 00:04:50.240\nSo, keep that in mind as well.\n\n87\n00:04:51.745 --> 00:04:54.375\nAll right, Ronnie, so what are we\ngonna take a look at next here?\n\n88\n00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:58.165\nWe've got physical servers\nversus virtual servers.\n\n89\n00:04:58.165 --> 00:05:02.605\nIn the last episode, we were playing\naround with Hyper-V, a little bit.\n\n90\n00:05:02.605 --> 00:05:06.030\nBut this is, really,\nI don't even want to use the term trend,\n\n91\n00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.350\nbut I would say the shift in the way\nthat computing is headed nowadays.\n\n92\n00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.370\nIn the past,\nwe think about our servers, and\n\n93\n00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.980\nthey were just these either rack mounted\nor boxes, custom builds, and you would\n\n94\n00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.930\nhave your physical magnetics spindle\ndrives that you would insert into them.\n\n95\n00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.560\nAdd all that hardware, and really,\nif we're talking about dedicated server,\n\n96\n00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.740\nyou might have a box for DHCP.\n\n97\n00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.210\nYou might have a box for DNS.\n\n98\n00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.010\nBut nowadays, we see a big shift.\n\n99\n00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.490\nWe see a lot of virtualization.\n\n100\n00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.820\nAnd what do we get with virtualization?\n\n101\n00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.280\nWe get a more secure system.\n\n102\n00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.360\nLess coding means less chances for\nan attacker to break into that coding or\n\n103\n00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.272\nto expose or take advantage of any\nvulnerabilities or weaknesses.\n\n104\n00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.510\nInstead of having five different boxes\nsitting here in a server closet,\n\n105\n00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.610\nI may only have one.\n\n106\n00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.240\nSo I only, I have less amount\nof power consumption, so\n\n107\n00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.540\nthat's going to be more cost effective for\nmy organization.\n\n108\n00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.140\nAnd if we think about places like New\nYork City where the rent is astronomical,\n\n109\n00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.280\nI may also really consider\nthe physical cost reduction as well.\n\n110\n00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.720\nSo virtualization is definitely\nthe way we're heading,\n\n111\n00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.895\nand we don't really focus too\nmuch on this particular show.\n\n112\n00:06:21.895 --> 00:06:23.645\nBut if you are gonna be\nworking with server,\n\n113\n00:06:23.645 --> 00:06:26.950\nthen you definitely wanna get\nacclimated with that in the future.\n\n114\n00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.615\n&gt;&gt; And the key component here when we deal\nwith server, right, is to realize that\n\n115\n00:06:30.615 --> 00:06:34.335\nyou're gonna run into both if you're\nnot really experienced with either one.\n\n116\n00:06:34.335 --> 00:06:37.775\nYou're gonna find inside of a shop or\nwherever you end up working,\n\n117\n00:06:37.775 --> 00:06:41.215\nthere will be physical machines that\nwill end up running Windows Server,\n\n118\n00:06:41.215 --> 00:06:44.720\nwhich is great and\nthat works the way that we want it to.\n\n119\n00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.953\nBut also, within those servers themselves,\nyou may find that there is gonna be\n\n120\n00:06:48.953 --> 00:06:53.519\nanother component that's gonna allow you\nto create virtual servers in them as well.\n\n121\n00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:56.183\nAnd that means it's gonna\nall be done in software.\n\n122\n00:06:56.183 --> 00:07:00.592\nSo, servers are not only physical devices\nthat are running one operating system.\n\n123\n00:07:00.592 --> 00:07:03.976\nThey can be physical devices\nrunning a piece of software which\n\n124\n00:07:03.976 --> 00:07:07.790\nis running multiple operating\nsystems on top of them as well.\n\n125\n00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.820\nAnd you're gonna see any one of\nthose different environments\n\n126\n00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.140\nwherever you end up working.\n\n127\n00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.560\nThe virtualization, of course,\n\n128\n00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.990\nhas become more popular because\nit save companies money overall.\n\n129\n00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:23.780\nWhen I can run five or six, or\n10 servers, on one big super solid,\n\n130\n00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.810\nhigh performance hardware, rather than\njust buying that super high performance\n\n131\n00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.766\nmachine and saying, well, I can only\nrun one of these operating systems, and\n\n132\n00:07:31.766 --> 00:07:33.370\nI can only do so much with it.\n\n133\n00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.460\nSo it brings up what we\ncall high optimization,\n\n134\n00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.730\nthat's kind of a key element\nthat you're gonna run into.\n\n135\n00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.450\nNow, before we move on from\nthe idea of software here,\n\n136\n00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:48.094\nwe also need to talk about some management\nperspectives of server as well.\n\n137\n00:07:48.094 --> 00:07:51.720\nSo, Cherokee, talk to us about\nthe difference between what we call\n\n138\n00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.070\na domain versus a work group environment.\n\n139\n00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.016\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so if we take a look at my screen\nhere, I actually have a diagram and\n\n140\n00:07:58.016 --> 00:07:59.716\nwe can kind of compare the two.\n\n141\n00:07:59.716 --> 00:08:01.324\nSo Workgroup.\n\n142\n00:08:01.324 --> 00:08:07.212\nWorkgroup is going to be a feature that\nMicrosoft provides that will allow,\n\n143\n00:08:07.212 --> 00:08:10.460\nI guess it's less complicated to setup.\n\n144\n00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.730\nIt's really for a smaller environment.\n\n145\n00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.807\nYou don't wanna be using this, I wouldn't\nsay more than ten users setup for\n\n146\n00:08:16.807 --> 00:08:17.630\nworkgroup.\n\n147\n00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.360\nAnd all of those users have\nto be on the same network,\n\n148\n00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.640\nwhereas domains are gonna be created for\nlarger enterprise environment,\n\n149\n00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.260\nyou do not have to be on the same network\nto be joined to a particular domain.\n\n150\n00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.830\nAnd Microsoft does a really\ngreat job of organizing things.\n\n151\n00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.810\nSo if you think about a way\nyou can organize a company,\n\n152\n00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:40.340\nthen domains would be\na great way to do that.\n\n153\n00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:45.770\nSo there is one concept that is a little\nbit more holistic than a domain and\n\n154\n00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.530\nthat would be a forest.\n\n155\n00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.540\nSo that would be all encompassing.\n\n156\n00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.040\nYou can have multiple domains\nwithin your forest, but\n\n157\n00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.020\nthey're all related in some particular\nway, which is great, like Ronnie says,\n\n158\n00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:02.180\nfor management, because it can\nsimplify and really just help\n\n159\n00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:07.110\nme understand logically how I'm\nmanaging my particular organizations.\n\n160\n00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.940\nSo, if we take a look here at number one,\n\n161\n00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.500\nthe computers can be located\non different networks.\n\n162\n00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.430\nIn the workgroup, no, domain based, yes.\n\n163\n00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.320\nComputers are centrally managed.\n\n164\n00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.136\nLike we spoke about, yeah,\nit's gonna make my job a lot easier,\n\n165\n00:09:20.136 --> 00:09:21.120\nyour job a lot easier.\n\n166\n00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.770\nI can manually manage them\nin one central location.\n\n167\n00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.270\nValid for many servers?\n\n168\n00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.090\nNo, not when we're\ntalking about workgroups.\n\n169\n00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.595\nLike I said,\nyou wanna keep that at least ten or less.\n\n170\n00:09:31.595 --> 00:09:33.200\nDomain-joined?\n\n171\n00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.430\nYeah, really, your budget or\n\n172\n00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.840\nthe sky is the limit when we're talking\nabout how large the domain can be.\n\n173\n00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:43.450\nAnd viable for\nniche roles such as a kiosks.\n\n174\n00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:49.531\nWell, if I don't want a particular machine\nattached to my domain, then sure, why not.\n\n175\n00:09:49.531 --> 00:09:54.732\nIf I wanna go ahead and think about it\nfrom the onset from a security standpoint,\n\n176\n00:09:54.732 --> 00:09:59.940\nhey, I don't want this machine to have\naccess to all my network resources.\n\n177\n00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.910\nThen, yeah, I'd go ahead and\nsetup a workgroup for\n\n178\n00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.450\nthat particular outward-facing system.\n\n179\n00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.540\nUsers can have a single user account and\nsign into every computer.\n\n180\n00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.650\nThis is an important consideration\nbecause if we think about domains,\n\n181\n00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.480\none of the main reasons we implement\ndomains I mean for that unification, but\n\n182\n00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.130\nwe also have something\ncalled single sign on.\n\n183\n00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:24.450\n&gt;&gt; So I, as an individual with\na user account, can go and\n\n184\n00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:29.050\nsit down at multiple systems,\nwithin my organization or environment, and\n\n185\n00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.660\nlog on with the credentials\nassociated with myself.\n\n186\n00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.398\nNow, there are different\nways you can set that up.\n\n187\n00:10:34.398 --> 00:10:37.820\nYou can setup computer account and\nso forth, but\n\n188\n00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:42.790\nwe have an entire section coming up later\non Active Directory so we'll get to that.\n\n189\n00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:46.826\nSo, for now if you just think about\nyou have your domain controllers those\n\n190\n00:10:46.826 --> 00:10:49.821\nare housing,\na database of all this information about\n\n191\n00:10:49.821 --> 00:10:53.034\nall the particular account and\nrules within your system.\n\n192\n00:10:53.034 --> 00:10:56.080\nSo, centralized management.\n\n193\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.101\nGood thing to note there.\n\n194\n00:10:58.101 --> 00:11:03.042\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Cherokee if you haven't\nactually been in that environment where\n\n195\n00:11:03.042 --> 00:11:07.740\npeople are not able to distinguish\nbetween workgroups and servers,\n\n196\n00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.519\nmost of the companies that you and\nup working for more than likely would\n\n197\n00:11:12.519 --> 00:11:17.541\ngenerally be in a domain environment,\nwhere we can centrally manage a lot\n\n198\n00:11:17.541 --> 00:11:23.330\nof the resource that we need as well as\nindividuals logging into the machines.\n\n199\n00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.210\nBut if you're in a workgroup environment,\n\n200\n00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:28.650\nthe easiest way at least administratively\nthat you'll be able to tell if you don't\n\n201\n00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:33.540\nhave any experience in this If they say\nhey, I need you to configure this but\n\n202\n00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.330\nyou're not going to a central\nlocation to configure it.\n\n203\n00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.010\nThey're sending you to\nactually different computers\n\n204\n00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.930\nto make sure that you're\nmanaging them individually.\n\n205\n00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.970\nWell in a workgroup environment you\nhave to touch every single machine so\n\n206\n00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.620\nthere's no one way to centrally\nadministrate anything.\n\n207\n00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.710\nIt's gonna be in that type of environment.\n\n208\n00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.530\nSo make sure you can distinguish that.\n\n209\n00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.800\nNot every single person out there is\ngonna always work in a larger company.\n\n210\n00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.445\nYou may end up finding out that you're\nworking in a small company that\n\n211\n00:11:59.445 --> 00:12:03.510\nhas three Window Servers running but\nthey're really running as\n\n212\n00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:07.350\nindividual machines even though\nthey're on the same network together.\n\n213\n00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:10.480\nBut they're really kind of\nstandalone individual computers and\n\n214\n00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.390\nif you're having to log into each one,\nthen you'll know that, hey,\n\n215\n00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:17.610\nthis is more than likely what we're inside\nthat work group environment instead.\n\n216\n00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.730\nSo it's a good way for\n\n217\n00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:23.540\nus to do some management distinguishing\nthat we need to at this point too.\n\n218\n00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.610\nAll right, so Cherokee, what are some of\nthe other considerations we need to know\n\n219\n00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:28.960\nin our peak into Windows, right.\n\n220\n00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.430\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, security is integrated into\njust about every facet of an organization.\n\n221\n00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.950\nSo when we talk about IT,\nit really isn't any different.\n\n222\n00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:40.300\nWe really need to think about\nhow security and our servers.\n\n223\n00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.930\nWhat we can do to help increase\nthe security within our organization by\n\n224\n00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:48.420\nhardening our servers and\nwhat options we have available to us.\n\n225\n00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.830\nSo there are a lot of\ndifferent things we can do.\n\n226\n00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.770\nMicrosoft even from\nthe onset they think about\n\n227\n00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.490\nhow can I make this operating\nsystem more secure?\n\n228\n00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.230\nThey provide us with things\nlike a group policy.\n\n229\n00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.175\nAnd if we took a look at my screen here,\n\n230\n00:13:01.175 --> 00:13:04.320\nI'll show you guys just a couple of\ndifferent things that you can, and\n\n231\n00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.730\nwe won't get it too much here but\nagain if I just go ahead and\n\n232\n00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:13.185\npull up a run line, oops sorry.\n\n233\n00:13:13.185 --> 00:13:14.545\nGo ahead and right click on that.\n\n234\n00:13:14.545 --> 00:13:16.215\nThere is left clicking.\n\n235\n00:13:16.215 --> 00:13:18.195\nAnd you look click happy here.\n\n236\n00:13:18.195 --> 00:13:21.548\nAnd the actual short cut\nthe run line code for\n\n237\n00:13:21.548 --> 00:13:25.269\ngroup policy management\nconsole is gpmc.msc.\n\n238\n00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:28.515\nAnd you can go ahead and\nzoom in you can see that.\n\n239\n00:13:28.515 --> 00:13:31.410\nAnd then just go ahead and click OK.\n\n240\n00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:38.010\nAnd that'll pull up our Group Policy\nManagement console right here.\n\n241\n00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.120\nAnd I'll zoom out a little bit.\n\n242\n00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.500\nAnd so whenever I create my\nfirst domain controller, and\n\n243\n00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.200\nI create a domain by default,\nI get a Default Domain Policy.\n\n244\n00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:53.150\nAnd just scrolling down, I can take\na look at different components here for\n\n245\n00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:57.675\nour group policy objects, we have WMI\nfilters are gonna be based on hardware,\n\n246\n00:13:57.675 --> 00:14:02.580\nstarter GPOs and,\nwhich ones do we wanna look at here?\n\n247\n00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.720\nI think for now we'll go ahead and take\na look at our default domain policy and\n\n248\n00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.750\nyou can see that we have, Policies and\n\n249\n00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.900\npreferences you really wanna take\na look at policies which are enforced,\n\n250\n00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.850\npreferences are just in\nfact that preferences.\n\n251\n00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:21.390\nSo we have software settings, you can set\nspecific rules in which users within your\n\n252\n00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:26.570\nenvironment abide to like we were talking\nabout centralized administration and\n\n253\n00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.350\nthis is a really great way\nto take a look at it here.\n\n254\n00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.560\nAnd there's just a lot of different things\nthat we can do to really incorporate\n\n255\n00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.130\nsecurity into our networks.\n\n256\n00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.580\nWhat else do we have here?\n\n257\n00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.080\n&gt;&gt; When you go into Windows settings,\nis what you're looking for.\n\n258\n00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.700\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; For our Windows settings here?\n\n259\n00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.240\nYeah, you can go in and\nexpand this out too.\n\n260\n00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.880\n&gt;&gt; And then notice there's one that says,\nsecurity settings there.\n\n261\n00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.980\n&gt;&gt; Security settings.\n\n262\n00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.420\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n263\n00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.370\n&gt;&gt; Account policies,\n\n264\n00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:53.960\nlocal policies, event logs, all sorts\nof integrated security options here.\n\n265\n00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:59.430\nAnd this is, an addition to what\nMicrosoft has provided, you know,\n\n266\n00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:02.090\non our client side, the Windows Firewall.\n\n267\n00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:05.840\nSo we have that integrated as well,\nsoftware restrictions.\n\n268\n00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.240\nSo there's a lot of different\nthings that we can set and\n\n269\n00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.470\nconfigure to make sure our\nsystem is inherently secure.\n\n270\n00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:16.096\nAnd one of the really cool things that\nI like about server is something called\n\n271\n00:15:16.096 --> 00:15:19.451\nfeatures on demand which we'll be\ntaking a look at a little bit later.\n\n272\n00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:23.316\nBut by default they don't just\ngive you this operating system\n\n273\n00:15:23.316 --> 00:15:27.790\nout of the box with everything\ninstalled and bogging your system down.\n\n274\n00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.020\nYou really kind of have to pick and\n\n275\n00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.870\nchoose what you want on your system\nby utilizing features on demand.\n\n276\n00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.886\nSo that's a really cool concept as well.\n\n277\n00:15:35.886 --> 00:15:40.975\nAnd things like proxy servers,\ndemilitarized zones, different ways\n\n278\n00:15:40.975 --> 00:15:46.994\nwe can design and setup our networks using\nthese services just to create an overall,\n\n279\n00:15:46.994 --> 00:15:51.350\nholistic approach to having\nthat secure environment.\n\n280\n00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.171\nMultiple layers, if you guys\nhave taken any CompTIA exams or\n\n281\n00:15:54.171 --> 00:15:57.159\nstudied for For that you'll know\nthe term defense in depth, and\n\n282\n00:15:57.159 --> 00:15:59.558\nthat's really what we have\nthe ability to do here.\n\n283\n00:15:59.558 --> 00:16:01.674\nAs administrators, we can configure and\n\n284\n00:16:01.674 --> 00:16:04.398\nset these things up on\nan individual granular level.\n\n285\n00:16:04.398 --> 00:16:07.560\nSo we're just adding to that complexity.\n\n286\n00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:13.570\n&gt;&gt; And Cherokee, the idea here for\nus is fairly simple in this stance, right?\n\n287\n00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:16.220\nWe wanna make sure, of course,\nthat servers are secure.\n\n288\n00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.600\nAnd the great thing is Windows Server,\nitself, provides us the ability to\n\n289\n00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.250\nbe able to harden those servers,\nexpose a little bit as we can.\n\n290\n00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:29.980\nAnd allow us to even not have as\nmany ports turned on as normal.\n\n291\n00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.700\nSo just like what Cherokee\nwas showing earlier in part\n\n292\n00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.730\none about the nano install where\nthere's not as many services going on.\n\n293\n00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.530\nWell, that reduces, of course,\n\n294\n00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.980\nthe security foot print and\nthe exposure that we have there, too.\n\n295\n00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.489\nBut by adding in group policy, and\nthen adding in layers of security,\n\n296\n00:16:45.489 --> 00:16:48.590\nit becomes a solid part of\nthe security of the entire network.\n\n297\n00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:54.480\nAnd that's what Server 2016 or\nbasic servers are designed to do.\n\n298\n00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.360\nIt's not just suppose to offer services,\n\n299\n00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:01.070\nbut also be apart of that server and\nthat security infrastructure that we have.\n\n300\n00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.270\nSo Cherokee, we not only,\n\n301\n00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:07.280\nof course, work in terms of virtualization\non our own networks and also the hardware.\n\n302\n00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.120\nBut we also move into the cloud\nwith Server, don't we?\n\n303\n00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:10.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we sure do.\n\n304\n00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.140\nSo when we take a look at\nServer inside the cloud,\n\n305\n00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.900\nthis is kind of an interesting term.\n\n306\n00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.540\nMaybe you've heard of it,\nyou probably have, but\n\n307\n00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.710\nyou might wanna think about not\nall cloud is created equal.\n\n308\n00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.170\nThere are different levels and\n\n309\n00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.250\ndifferent offerings when we're\ntalking about different cloud models.\n\n310\n00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.910\nSo traditionally, when you think\nabout cloud you may think of\n\n311\n00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:34.210\nutilizing someone else's service,\nbut that's not always the case.\n\n312\n00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:38.900\nYou can have your own private cloud, and\nyou may also hear this term on-prem.\n\n313\n00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.350\nSo on-premises means that that\nhardware is at your site.\n\n314\n00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:46.570\nYou can offer cloud service offerings.\n\n315\n00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:51.260\nSo me as an organization,\nI can set up a cluster of servers.\n\n316\n00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:56.010\nAnd it's all integrated within the server\noperating system in order to do so.\n\n317\n00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.630\nSo I could have redundancy for\nmy own organization.\n\n318\n00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.904\nI don't always have to go outside\nto a third party, like Azure or\n\n319\n00:18:03.904 --> 00:18:08.427\nany kind of AWS Amazon Web services there,\nand use those services.\n\n320\n00:18:08.427 --> 00:18:13.070\nI can have my own cloud set up,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n321\n00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.991\nI don't want you to get boxed in,\ninto thinking in any one way.\n\n322\n00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:19.563\nYou can get really creative with it, and\nwho knows where we're gonna be going in\n\n323\n00:18:19.563 --> 00:18:22.240\nthe future with those different\ncloud service offerings?\n\n324\n00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.410\nBut it's pretty cool to think about that.\n\n325\n00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, some of the administrative\nthings that we also need to consider when\n\n326\n00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.600\ntalking about Windows Server,\nespecially in the cloud,\n\n327\n00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.200\nis that we're not really controlling\na lot of the infrastructure.\n\n328\n00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.130\nThat's what we're giving access to.\n\n329\n00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.016\nWe may be able to configure it\nto work the way that we need to.\n\n330\n00:18:37.016 --> 00:18:38.493\nBut network connectivity,\n\n331\n00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:41.820\nwe have to ensure that we have\nthat if we're gonna connect to it.\n\n332\n00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:42.380\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n333\n00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.550\n&gt;&gt; We also must make sure that\nwe understand something, that\n\n334\n00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:50.440\nnot every cloud service provides the same\namount of time for things to get done.\n\n335\n00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.750\nSo you can't assume that something\nis gonna be instantaneous\n\n336\n00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.180\nwhen you run something.\n\n337\n00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.240\nYou may have to give it a little\nbit more time than you think.\n\n338\n00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.143\nSo you have to be prepared for\nthe nature and things of that sort,\n\n339\n00:19:02.143 --> 00:19:06.750\neven if it's just operating the basic\nWindows Server and turning on services.\n\n340\n00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:11.130\nI know, for example, when I work with\nsome of the cloud services in Office 365,\n\n341\n00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.220\nwhich is a product you'll probably end\nup getting familiar with, as well.\n\n342\n00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.710\nThat sometimes they tell you, it may\ntake an hour or it may take longer or\n\n343\n00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.235\nit may take up to ten minutes\nbefore something is done.\n\n344\n00:19:21.235 --> 00:19:25.275\nWell, that could also, due to the very\nfact of your connection speed,\n\n345\n00:19:25.275 --> 00:19:28.145\nas well as how busy that cloud network is.\n\n346\n00:19:28.145 --> 00:19:31.655\nSo don't take for granted that\nthings that are done instantaneously\n\n347\n00:19:31.655 --> 00:19:35.655\nwhen you're working on-premises, here,\nthat they're gonna be the same, of course,\n\n348\n00:19:35.655 --> 00:19:37.660\ninside the cloud as well.\n\n349\n00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.530\nAll right, so Cherokee,\n\n350\n00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:42.450\nnow that we understand that,\nthere's still a lot more to Server and\n\n351\n00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:46.370\nsome of the things that we have to be\nfamiliar with as server administrators.\n\n352\n00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.530\nWhat are some of those topics\nthat we need to think about?\n\n353\n00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and just to add to that idea,\n\n354\n00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.440\nyou mentioned we would have to\ngive up some of that control.\n\n355\n00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:58.080\nAnd sometimes, it's not always an all or\nnothing type of solution.\n\n356\n00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.050\nYou can have a mixture\nof hybrid solutions,\n\n357\n00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.320\nbecause we were just\nspeaking about security.\n\n358\n00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:07.220\nAnd if you think about it, I'm not giving\nbackground checks and hiring these admins\n\n359\n00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.510\nto someone if their added data center\nmanaging my information, right?\n\n360\n00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.550\nSo I have to give up a little\nbit of that control.\n\n361\n00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:15.720\nBut maybe, the really sensitive\ninformation on my network, I go ahead and\n\n362\n00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.890\nmanage locally, on-prem.\n\n363\n00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.534\nAnd dole out the least\nsensitive information, and\n\n364\n00:20:20.534 --> 00:20:22.080\nhave someone else manage it.\n\n365\n00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.726\nSo you just kinda have\nto think about that,\n\n366\n00:20:23.726 --> 00:20:25.398\nit's definitely something to consider.\n\n367\n00:20:25.398 --> 00:20:29.040\nAnd there are also are other concepts\nthat we will be considering throughout\n\n368\n00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:29.890\nthis show.\n\n369\n00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:34.130\nSo just to name a few of them,\nwe thought take a look at subnetting.\n\n370\n00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.600\nSo subnetting is something\nthat we will be covering, and\n\n371\n00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:41.700\nit's a way that we can logically\ndivide and segregate our networks.\n\n372\n00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.740\nSo we'll also be taking a look at VLAN.\n\n373\n00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.680\nSo for our virtual local area networks,\n\n374\n00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.040\nis another way that we can logically\ndivide and segregate our networks.\n\n375\n00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.600\nAnd we'll also be looking at,\n\n376\n00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.680\nwhat else do we have here, DHCP,\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol.\n\n377\n00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.490\nThat's going to be one of our core network\nservices, very important to understand.\n\n378\n00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:03.060\nWe'll go ahead and\nset a system up, explain all that.\n\n379\n00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.960\nSet up our scopes to make sure you fully\nunderstand how that process works.\n\n380\n00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.980\nWe'll also be taking a look at DNS.\n\n381\n00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:13.100\nSo for our domain naming systems,\nor DNS servers, we'll see that.\n\n382\n00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.100\nWe'll look at how to create zones, and\n\n383\n00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:19.490\nhow to manage those within our\nServer Microsoft environment here.\n\n384\n00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.480\nRouting and switching so\nthis is a big one, regardless.\n\n385\n00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.610\nAnd these core services,\nwe're talking about DHCP, DNS, routing and\n\n386\n00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:29.020\nswitching, these are vendor independent.\n\n387\n00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.180\nSo regardless if you're using a Microsoft\nplatform, a mixed platform, or\n\n388\n00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.770\nan nix base platform,\nyou're still gonna have these components.\n\n389\n00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.670\nJust, we're gonna be looking\nat it from a Microsoft\n\n390\n00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.786\nperspective when we\napproach these concepts.\n\n391\n00:21:41.786 --> 00:21:46.114\nAnd load balancing, that's something\nyou heard me probably mentioned already\n\n392\n00:21:46.114 --> 00:21:50.198\nbecause that is something that is very\ncommon in a production environment.\n\n393\n00:21:50.198 --> 00:21:55.347\nI guess we have a responsibility,\nRonnie, if we talk about networking and\n\n394\n00:21:55.347 --> 00:21:59.448\nour uptime, and\nyou might have heard this term of five 9s.\n\n395\n00:21:59.448 --> 00:22:02.677\nIt's depending on your\nservice level agreement, but\n\n396\n00:22:02.677 --> 00:22:06.690\nit's implied that we have reliable\nservices within our networks.\n\n397\n00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:14.290\nAnd 99.999 equates to like what,\n5.05 seconds of down time, annually?\n\n398\n00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.243\nSo that's not a lot of wiggle room.\n\n399\n00:22:16.243 --> 00:22:21.145\nAnd so we want to have multiple\nredundancies in place so that\n\n400\n00:22:21.145 --> 00:22:25.835\nif something were to fail, we've always\nthought about a plan B, if you will.\n\n401\n00:22:25.835 --> 00:22:30.085\nSo that we can maintain that\ncontinuity for our organizations.\n\n402\n00:22:30.085 --> 00:22:34.760\nSo earlier, in the previous episode,\nwe started an installation.\n\n403\n00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.590\nI do wanna check on that before\nwe head out for this show.\n\n404\n00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.470\nSo if we could, please,\n\n405\n00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.050\njump to my screen and let's just\ntake a look at that Virtual Machine.\n\n406\n00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.692\nI believe that one was\ngoing to be PLABSA01.\n\n407\n00:22:45.692 --> 00:22:50.796\nAnd we'll just go ahead and\nrelaunch that system.\n\n408\n00:22:50.796 --> 00:22:54.178\nNow that installation has\ncompleted successfully, but\n\n409\n00:22:54.178 --> 00:22:57.270\nthere are a few things\nthat we do need to do.\n\n410\n00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:01.140\nSo for the administrator name, we need\nto go ahead and type in a password.\n\n411\n00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.950\nAnd for the sake of this show,\nI'll use my top secret password here.\n\n412\n00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.014\nHopefully, it's the same, and,\n\n413\n00:23:12.178 --> 00:23:16.350\nYou don't wanna do as we say,\nyou wanna [LAUGH].\n\n414\n00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.171\nOr don't do as we do,\ndo as we say when it comes to passwords.\n\n415\n00:23:19.171 --> 00:23:21.140\nAnd if you've taken any CompTIA classes,\n\n416\n00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:25.670\nthen I'm sure you've been reminded of\nthat and how to create secure passwords.\n\n417\n00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:29.800\nIn the next episode, we'll also talk\nabout naming your computers and\n\n418\n00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.150\ncreating a logical naming convention.\n\n419\n00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:35.535\nBut really, that's it for\nthis particular system here,\n\n420\n00:23:35.535 --> 00:23:38.168\nbecause I'm in a virtual environment here.\n\n421\n00:23:38.168 --> 00:23:42.145\nThis is our little Alt+Ctrl+Delete button,\nand you guys will get familiar with that\n\n422\n00:23:42.145 --> 00:23:44.269\nif you are logging in to\nyour lab environment or\n\n423\n00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:46.250\nworking with virtualization.\n\n424\n00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:47.900\nBut Ronnie, I think that's about it.\n\n425\n00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:52.180\nA good starting point for\nus to go ahead and call it a show.\n\n426\n00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.499\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\neven that last screen that you showed us,\n\n427\n00:23:54.499 --> 00:23:57.620\nthe idea of connecting to the cloud\na little bit, is kind of neat.\n\n428\n00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.480\nWhere you see it's kind of painting in and\ndoing all of that.\n\n429\n00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.810\nA lot has to do with latency that\nwe're talking about, as well.\n\n430\n00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.890\nIt may take a little bit longer time for\n\n431\n00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:07.300\nthings to finish before we realize it,\ntoo.\n\n432\n00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.130\nBut that's a good peek into,\nof course, what Windows Server,\n\n433\n00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.220\nif you don't have a lot\nof experience in it.\n\n434\n00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:18.420\nWhere we did take a look at some of the\nsoftware requirements that are out there.\n\n435\n00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.250\nAnd some of the ways that\nsoftware does break down\n\n436\n00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.860\nwhat we talked about the kernel.\n\n437\n00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.990\nSome of the different services as well as\nsecurity elements that we need to address.\n\n438\n00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:30.440\nAnd even a look into the future of\nwhat this show is gonna bring us.\n\n439\n00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.210\nTo help make sure that we understand from\nthe server adminstration side, right?\n\n440\n00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.692\nFrom the managing as well as\nthe maintenance type of things that\n\n441\n00:24:37.692 --> 00:24:40.040\nwe're expected to be able to do.\n\n442\n00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.330\nBut Cherokee's right, it is a great place\nfor us to also go ahead and sign off then.\n\n443\n00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.822\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nRonnie Wong.\n\n444\n00:24:46.822 --> 00:24:48.281\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n445\n00:24:48.281 --> 00:24:51.036\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Windows Server 101 shows\n\n446\n00:24:51.036 --> 00:24:59.267\n[MUSIC]\n\n447\n00:24:59.267 -->

00:00:07.507\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:12.295\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:15.002\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:16.978\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today,\n\n7\n00:00:16.978 --> 00:00:19.651\nyou're watching\nthe Windows Server 101 show.\n\n8\n00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:22.401\nWe're about to dive in the realm\nof the server manager,\n\n9\n00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:26.159\nsomething that every system administrator\nis gonna have to learn how to do.\n\n10\n00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.550\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be Ms.\nCherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.790\nCherokee welcome to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.960\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.980\nYeah, so server manager is\ngoing to be your one stop shop.\n\n14\n00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.040\nIt's a very easy place, in order to\nprovide that centralized management.\n\n15\n00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.410\nWe can even manage servers remotely,\nby using Server Manager so\n\n16\n00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.470\nthis is pretty cool.\n\n17\n00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.840\nLet's go ahead and get acclimated,\nif you take a look at my screen, just so\n\n18\n00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.940\nwe can get familiar with the layout here.\n\n19\n00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.668\nSo by default Server Manager is\ngoing to pop-up automatically,\n\n20\n00:00:52.668 --> 00:00:56.869\nif that's something you don't want to\nhappen then you can also go head and\n\n21\n00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:00.821\nchange that under manage,\nover here on the top right-hand corner.\n\n22\n00:01:00.821 --> 00:01:03.468\nAnd if you go under\nServer Manager Properties,\n\n23\n00:01:03.468 --> 00:01:06.857\nyou really have the ability to\ncustomize your environment.\n\n24\n00:01:06.857 --> 00:01:10.327\nIf you don't want it to come up again,\nyou would just go ahead and\n\n25\n00:01:10.327 --> 00:01:13.380\nselect that, but\nI'm gonna hit Cancel for now.\n\n26\n00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.940\nSo what are some things you\ncan do with Server Manager?\n\n27\n00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.440\nWell, you can provide that\ncentralized management, but\n\n28\n00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.080\nyou can also configure your\nlocal machine as well.\n\n29\n00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.560\nSo that's kind of what we're looking at\n\n30\n00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.840\nhere with this first button to\nconfigure this local server.\n\n31\n00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.890\nYou can also add roles and features which\nis going to be a significant portion of\n\n32\n00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.060\nwhat you do as a server admin.\n\n33\n00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.570\nSo we dedicated an entire show for that.\n\n34\n00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.570\nWe won't really talk about\nthat too much in this episode.\n\n35\n00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.290\nNow, another thing add\nservers to manage and\n\n36\n00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.130\nin the previous episode I mentioned how\nMicrosoft does a really great job at\n\n37\n00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.600\nallowing you to logically\norganize your environments.\n\n38\n00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.270\nSo by providing they build\nto add other servers,\n\n39\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.390\nwe don't want just add them, and\nadd them to this main dashboard view here.\n\n40\n00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.500\nWe can even create groups to\nhelp minimize that influx of\n\n41\n00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.770\nnotifications that we may see with\nall of them in this front page here.\n\n42\n00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.960\nSo we have the ability to\nalso create server groups.\n\n43\n00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.760\nAnd so we'll talk about why\nwe would want to do that and\n\n44\n00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.070\nhow we really should\nlogically approach it because\n\n45\n00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.770\nyou wanna make sure that not only you\nunderstand it, but people that you're\n\n46\n00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.990\nworking with within your environment\nunderstand your concepts as well.\n\n47\n00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.070\nYou also have the ability to\nconnect to Cloud services,\n\n48\n00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.580\nlike we mentioned in\nthe previous show as well.\n\n49\n00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.010\nSo what we wanna start with first is this\nview that we're looking at right here.\n\n50\n00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.340\nThis is going to be our dashboard.\n\n51\n00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.930\nAnd like I said, you can go ahead and\ndisable this if you need to.\n\n52\n00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.700\nBut over on the left-hand side, actually\nlet's just take a look here first.\n\n53\n00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.210\nWhat you originally see, right?\n\n54\n00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.810\nYou see information.\n\n55\n00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.520\nDown here I can see the roles and\nservices that are already installed.\n\n56\n00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.120\nSo this machine that I'm on right now,\n\n57\n00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.320\nhave it brought up on, is going to\nbe at file and storage services,\n\n58\n00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.760\nhave already been turned on and\nenabled, as well as Hyper-V.\n\n59\n00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.510\nAnd then here,\n\n60\n00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.400\nany kind of notifications would be\ndisplayed in this portion as well.\n\n61\n00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.130\nThey kind of stick with the whole green,\nyellow,\n\n62\n00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.030\nred, pretty universal convention as well.\n\n63\n00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.400\nSo you could handle and\ntake care of some minor adjustments and\n\n64\n00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.000\nissues right here from\nwithin the dashboard.\n\n65\n00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.490\nBut if we kind of move on\nover to the left pane and\n\n66\n00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.220\nclick on Local Server, this is where you\ncan really configure our first machine and\n\n67\n00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.296\nwe'll take a look at\nthe different options here.\n\n68\n00:03:35.296 --> 00:03:38.530\nSo, the first thing and I know I'm\njumping out of order here Ronnie, so\n\n69\n00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.120\nif you're looking at this\nI'm just gonna kind of go\n\n70\n00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.440\ndown the order of what you see when you're\nlooking at this particular section.\n\n71\n00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.407\nNow the machine that I'm on if you\nnotice this name, it's P-L-A-B-D-M 01.\n\n72\n00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.010\nLet's stop and\nthink about that for a second.\n\n73\n00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.130\nThe virtualization lab environment that\nI'm using is called practice labs.\n\n74\n00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.900\nSo that's where that first portion\nP-L-A-B comes in practice lab, okay.\n\n75\n00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.320\nIt makes a little sense.\n\n76\n00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.360\nI can understand it,\nyou can understand it.\n\n77\n00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.750\nLet's move on.\n\n78\n00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.660\nNow actually, this one is DM.\n\n79\n00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.660\nI'm not on a domain controller,\nI'm actually on a domain member.\n\n80\n00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.650\nSo DC, Domain Controller,\nDM, Domain Member.\n\n81\n00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.920\nAnd then we're also noted a zero one here,\nright?\n\n82\n00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.150\nSo this would be like,\ndomain member number one.\n\n83\n00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.420\nIn the book, there are actually\na couple of explanations or\n\n84\n00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.520\nexamples of how you might want\nto go ahead and name a system.\n\n85\n00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.450\nSo here we are two different sites.\n\n86\n00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:45.060\nOn the left side, we have San Diego and\non the right side we have New York City.\n\n87\n00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.230\nAnd by looking at theses\nnames we have SDDCO1.\n\n88\n00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.330\nSo,Ronnie if yo were working at\nthe same company I was, just by looking\n\n89\n00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.291\nat the particular at the particular name,\nwhat could you extract from that title?\n\n90\n00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:02.277\n&gt;&gt; SC.\n\n91\n00:05:02.277 --> 00:05:04.170\n&gt;&gt; SC for the San Diego.\n&gt;&gt; SC, some type of server configuration.\n\n92\n00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.838\n&gt;&gt; Well, if it's San Diego, so SD, sorry.\n\n93\n00:05:07.838 --> 00:05:09.928\n&gt;&gt; SD.\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry SD, that was my fault.\n\n94\n00:05:09.928 --> 00:05:10.878\n&gt;&gt; I can't really see it that well.\n\n95\n00:05:10.878 --> 00:05:12.691\n&gt;&gt; Okay, it is tiny.\n&gt;&gt; I see it would be San Diego.\n\n96\n00:05:12.691 --> 00:05:13.195\n&gt;&gt; San Diego, so\n\n97\n00:05:13.195 --> 00:05:16.106\nyou could automatically infer that we're\ntalking about the San Diego location.\n\n98\n00:05:16.106 --> 00:05:17.330\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n99\n00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.425\n&gt;&gt; And then the next one, DC,\nwhat do you think that one?\n\n100\n00:05:19.425 --> 00:05:20.880\n&gt;&gt; Domain Controller\n&gt;&gt; Domain Controller, right?\n\n101\n00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.460\nAnd then 01, so\nthat would be just my numbering scheme.\n\n102\n00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.000\nI could have several domain\ncontrollers if I choose to do so.\n\n103\n00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.230\nI should have that for redundancy there.\n\n104\n00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.177\nAnd if we look on the other side,\nwe've got NYC, what do you think?\n\n105\n00:05:33.177 --> 00:05:35.287\n&gt;&gt; New York City.\n\n106\n00:05:35.287 --> 00:05:36.649\n&gt;&gt; New York City, and WEB?\n\n107\n00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:38.100\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna assume a web server.\n\n108\n00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.721\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n109\n00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:41.750\nSo, it's pretty simple you can understand.\n\n110\n00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.800\nSo we've got a web-01, so\nthat's just an example there.\n\n111\n00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.870\nYou really don't wanna deviate too far\nfrom something logical, it's just gonna be\n\n112\n00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.860\na little confusing and difficult for\nothers within your environment.\n\n113\n00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.707\n&gt;&gt; Now a lot of times Cherokee if we're\njust really getting started with this\n\n114\n00:05:59.707 --> 00:06:03.506\nthe naming convention might not even\nbe ours to choose from or pick from.\n\n115\n00:06:03.506 --> 00:06:04.400\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n116\n00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.020\n&gt;&gt; So the key here right is to be able to\nunderstand whatever naming convention is\n\n117\n00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.490\nput before you.\n\n118\n00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.790\nSo whether somebody does it by site and\nthen what the role of the server is and\n\n119\n00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.910\nwhat number that particular server is.\n\n120\n00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.290\nThat's a great convention and\na lot of people do follow that or\n\n121\n00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.780\nthey choose to come up with\nwildly speculative names.\n\n122\n00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.390\nI've even see a whole network named after\nplanets inside of Star Wars before.\n\n123\n00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.572\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n124\n00:06:30.572 --> 00:06:32.719\n&gt;&gt; Go figure.\n&gt;&gt; I came across dragons before, but\n\n125\n00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:36.740\nsince I'm not too fluent on dragon lingo,\nit was difficult for me.\n\n126\n00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.730\nAnd that's what you really just hopeful\nyou don't have to encounter really.\n\n127\n00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:40.630\nSo.\n\n128\n00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.950\n&gt;&gt; Your next Dungeons and Dragons\nnetwork that you build there Cherokee,\n\n129\n00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.400\nit should be fun.\n\n130\n00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so we are gonna be\ntalking about DNS a little bit later,\n\n131\n00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.450\nwhich falls under this portion here for\nour domain name.\n\n132\n00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:58.160\nWe wanna keep a logical concept when we're\nchoosing the names of our domains as well.\n\n133\n00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.880\nFor this particular domain,\nyou can see how it's practicelabs.com.\n\n134\n00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.980\nSo in previous episodes we spoke\nabout work groups versus domains.\n\n135\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.480\nThis is where you could go ahead and\nadd a computer to your domain or\n\n136\n00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.330\nadd a computer to a work group,\nwe could remove it from a domain.\n\n137\n00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.022\nCouple of things though, because I am on a\ndomain member I could easily just come in\n\n138\n00:07:21.022 --> 00:07:23.477\nand change this computer name right here.\n\n139\n00:07:23.477 --> 00:07:29.471\nIf I'm working on a domain controller for\nunderpinning technology reasons,\n\n140\n00:07:29.471 --> 00:07:34.980\nI really don't want to be changing\nthe name of a domain controller.\n\n141\n00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.050\nSo if you are tasked with coming\nup with a naming convention,\n\n142\n00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.600\nyou wanna kinda think long and\nhard about it,\n\n143\n00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.480\nbecause it's not something you\nshould be going back and changing.\n\n144\n00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.960\nIt's possible, not recommended.\n\n145\n00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:50.145\nSo here, if I wanted to go ahead and\nswitch from my practice labs domain,\n\n146\n00:07:50.145 --> 00:07:54.322\nI could go ahead and join a work group,\nif I choose to do so.\n\n147\n00:07:54.322 --> 00:07:57.095\nBut let's just step back and\nthink about that for a minute.\n\n148\n00:07:57.095 --> 00:07:58.929\nSo, I have to have a couple of things.\n\n149\n00:07:58.929 --> 00:08:04.179\nI have to have administrative capabilities\nin order to Join a computer to a domain,\n\n150\n00:08:04.179 --> 00:08:08.280\nI have to have domain admin rights and\nsame goes for the inverse.\n\n151\n00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.840\nIf I'm removing a computer from a domain,\nI would want to make sure\n\n152\n00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.070\nthat I had administrative credentials for\na local accounts there.\n\n153\n00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.860\nBecause when I'm removing\nit from the domain,\n\n154\n00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.460\nI'm cutting ties with my domain account.\n\n155\n00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.090\nSo that's important to note, as well.\n\n156\n00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.980\nAnd so you would just simply go ahead and\n\n157\n00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.200\nchange these radio buttons to the work\ngroup and specify if you chose to do so.\n\n158\n00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.910\nAgain, all easily accessible\nright here from server manager.\n\n159\n00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.290\nIf we take a look at our Windows firewall,\nall right?\n\n160\n00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:40.840\nSo this is an easy way to go ahead and\nconnect here.\n\n161\n00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.683\nJust click on firewall,\n\n162\n00:08:42.683 --> 00:08:48.140\nnow originally are in the center pane\nhere we see our different profiles.\n\n163\n00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:52.449\nWe have our domain networks profile,\nprivate networks and guest or\n\n164\n00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:57.830\npublic networks, very similar to what we\nsee on our client side operating systems.\n\n165\n00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.680\nWith our client side systems,\nyou may be working with a laptop,\n\n166\n00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.110\na tablet, a lot more mobility.\n\n167\n00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.300\nWith our servers are usually,\nstationary or\n\n168\n00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:11.160\nstatic, so\nwe do have these profiles to be aware of.\n\n169\n00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.220\nAnd again,\nwe can also spoke about group policy,\n\n170\n00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.260\nwe'll get to that in the later shows.\n\n171\n00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:21.470\nYou can really just customize these\nsettings with advanced computer settings,\n\n172\n00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.330\nyou can allow an app or\nfeature through a firewall.\n\n173\n00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.740\nIf I wanted to hear Cortana,\nI have the ability to allow for\n\n174\n00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.820\nall three, you can see that noted.\n\n175\n00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.370\nBut maybe we talked about having\nour servers really streamline,\n\n176\n00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.110\nand harden them, and we want to remove\nall these additional capabilities.\n\n177\n00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:42.040\nSo there's just a lot of different\nsections you can go in and\n\n178\n00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.910\naccess easily,\nright here within Server Manager.\n\n179\n00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.250\nMoving along, what else do we see?\n\n180\n00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.745\nRemote management, so this pretty cool,\nwith Windows Server 2012 and\n\n181\n00:09:52.745 --> 00:09:57.290\n2016 by default Microsoft has\nenabled remote management.\n\n182\n00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:02.270\nNow if you're working with\na system older than that,\n\n183\n00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.030\nyou will need to go ahead and\nconfigure remote management.\n\n184\n00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:12.960\nSo doing so, you may need to, there's\nactually a PowerShell command right here.\n\n185\n00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.480\nAnd I know we haven't really dove\ninto PowerShell too much, but\n\n186\n00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.130\nwe will, don't worry.\n\n187\n00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.830\nAnd the links are gonna be in\nthe notes for this background info.\n\n188\n00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.850\nSo if you are working with older systems,\n\n189\n00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.700\njust note that there are a little extra\nworkarounds that you need to configure.\n\n190\n00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:33.260\nSuch as this enable PS remoting\nPowerShell commandlet.\n\n191\n00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:38.392\nBut for now, what we're gonna be using,\nthe operating system, in this\n\n192\n00:10:38.392 --> 00:10:44.470\nshow throughout this series is we're\ngonna be using Windows Server 2016, FYI.\n\n193\n00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:49.171\nAll right, so this is going to allow\nme to remotely manage servers,\n\n194\n00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:53.985\nif I want this server to be remotely\nmanaged, but again, I may not.\n\n195\n00:10:53.985 --> 00:10:58.395\nI may want to disable that as a security,\nif it coincides with my security policy.\n\n196\n00:10:58.395 --> 00:11:02.875\nMaybe my company is so\nconcerned with security they say look,\n\n197\n00:11:02.875 --> 00:11:07.365\nwe're only gonna allow for on-site\nmanagement, which you may encounter.\n\n198\n00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.230\nNow remote desktop,\n\n199\n00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:16.210\nthis one is actually by default disabled\nand you need to go ahead and enable it.\n\n200\n00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.910\nIf you wanted to allow\nremote desktop connections,\n\n201\n00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.440\nwhere you're logging into that system,\n\n202\n00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:27.650\npulling up their desktop as if you are\nsitting there In front of that computer.\n\n203\n00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:29.640\nSo remote management is\ngoing to be different.\n\n204\n00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.490\nThe underlying components and\nhow they connect are gonna be different.\n\n205\n00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.360\nThat's why we have two\nseparate options here.\n\n206\n00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.680\nLet's see, what do we have next?\n\n207\n00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.600\nSo our different adaptors.\n\n208\n00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:45.080\nWe're actually gonna have a show specific\nand focused on networking with server.\n\n209\n00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.820\nAnd if I just go ahead and\npull this up real quick,\n\n210\n00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.980\nyou can see the different adaptors that\nI have on this particular machine.\n\n211\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.490\nAnd then I would just go through.\n\n212\n00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.840\nI don't wanna scare you,\nI am in a lab environment.\n\n213\n00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.100\nYou may not have all of\nthese different adaptors but\n\n214\n00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.710\nyou could just right click\non a particular adaptor.\n\n215\n00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:03.340\nGo into Properties, and this is where you\nwould go ahead and kind of figure that.\n\n216\n00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:08.490\nWe'll get to it in a later episode but for\nnow, just so you see where to access that.\n\n217\n00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.490\nWhat else do we got going on here, Ronnie?\n\n218\n00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:18.538\nOver on this side, let's see,\nupdates, all right.\n\n219\n00:12:18.538 --> 00:12:21.530\nIt tells me when my last\nupdate was installed and\n\n220\n00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:25.150\ncurrently this machine is set\nto never check for updates.\n\n221\n00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.907\nWell that's crazy, Cherokee,\nwhy would you have that set like that?\n\n222\n00:12:27.907 --> 00:12:30.739\nWell, in a production environment,\n\n223\n00:12:30.739 --> 00:12:35.200\nI might not want updates to\nbe automatically calling out.\n\n224\n00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.330\nI may have some kind of system like\na Windows Update Server running.\n\n225\n00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.150\nSo, there are different\noptions that I have available.\n\n226\n00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.250\nAnd this is one place where you could,\n\n227\n00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:48.640\nmake sure that you have a good\nproper patch management scheme\n\n228\n00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.300\nthought out before you just randomly\nstart setting these configurations here.\n\n229\n00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.640\nSo you have different capabilities and\n\n230\n00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.700\nconfigurations right here again,\nall within server manager.\n\n231\n00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:05.210\nSo they really did think try to think of\nmost of the common activities that admins.\n\n232\n00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:08.490\nl mean, one of the common things\nthat you're gonna be dealing with is\n\n233\n00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.450\nalso information gathering.\n\n234\n00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.510\nAnd so when we think about that, we've\ngot like our little one stop shop here.\n\n235\n00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:18.426\nBecause as network admin you do have\nto maintain a lot of documentation.\n\n236\n00:13:18.426 --> 00:13:23.060\nSorry, if I'm the first person to tell\nyou that but it is very, very true.\n\n237\n00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.330\nAnd it tells you when you\ngot your updates last.\n\n238\n00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.040\nYou've got Windows Defender, okay.\n\n239\n00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.950\nIs your real time protection on or off?\n\n240\n00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.740\nSo that's also something\nelse you'd wanna consider.\n\n241\n00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.900\nSo when we're talking about protection, we\ndefinitely wanna have something enabled.\n\n242\n00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.980\nIf you're using a third party solution\nthen you would wanna go ahead and\n\n243\n00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.510\ndisable that but.\n\n244\n00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.540\nA couple things,\nlike even with your Windows Firewall.\n\n245\n00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.569\nYou definitely wanna\nmake sure that that's on.\n\n246\n00:13:48.569 --> 00:13:51.233\nRight here,\nyou can see it all in one stop.\n\n247\n00:13:51.233 --> 00:13:55.229\nNow, if we take a look right here,\nfor IE, all right, for\n\n248\n00:13:55.229 --> 00:14:00.290\nInternet Explorer,\nenhanced security configuration settings.\n\n249\n00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.590\nIt's currently set to off,\nokay, what does that mean?\n\n250\n00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:09.148\nWell, Ronnie, do you think it would\nbe appropriate if I were out browsing\n\n251\n00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:14.093\nthe web and shopping on Amazon on\na server within my environment?\n\n252\n00:14:14.093 --> 00:14:17.267\n&gt;&gt; It's not normally a best practice,\nlet's put it that way.\n\n253\n00:14:17.267 --> 00:14:20.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] there are a lot\n\n254\n00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.010\nof things that could go wrong there\nwhen I'm calling out to the Internet.\n\n255\n00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:24.994\nSo let's see here.\n\n256\n00:14:24.994 --> 00:14:30.040\nCurrently, the IE enhanced security\nconfiguration for this system is off.\n\n257\n00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.480\nSo if l want to go ahead and\n\n258\n00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:37.610\npull up the web browser, this is their\nintranet side for the robbing environment.\n\n259\n00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:42.470\nBut still l was able to connect and\nwe'll just use those recommended settings.\n\n260\n00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.930\nl wasn't on the machine l wanted to be on,\nbut they've configured this.\n\n261\n00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.900\nI mean, let's see if we're able\nto go ahead and go out the way,\n\n262\n00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.830\nit's configured here.\n\n263\n00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.662\nYeah, I think it will let us\ngo to theirs is a the UK.\n\n264\n00:14:53.662 --> 00:14:55.951\nI'm allowed to access the web, right?\n\n265\n00:14:55.951 --> 00:15:01.807\nBut if I wanted to just add that security,\nharden my system a little bit,\n\n266\n00:15:01.807 --> 00:15:05.457\nthen what I could do here\nis simply go in here.\n\n267\n00:15:05.457 --> 00:15:11.706\nAnd, now I also have the ability to\nsay look, I'm gonna granularly select.\n\n268\n00:15:11.706 --> 00:15:16.566\nDo I only want to turn this particular\nfeature on for just users or\n\n269\n00:15:16.566 --> 00:15:18.550\nadministrators as well?\n\n270\n00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:23.147\nSo let's go ahead and enable our\nInternet Explore Enhanced Security\n\n271\n00:15:23.147 --> 00:15:28.030\nconfiguration for both here,\nand we'll hit OK, all right.\n\n272\n00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.440\nIt may take a second to refresh here but\nlet's just go ahead.\n\n273\n00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.520\nAnd this is the Refresh button, so if you\nwanted to see if it changes, okay and\n\n274\n00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.240\nnow it changed,\njust had to give it a second.\n\n275\n00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.690\nBe a little bit patient from off to on.\n\n276\n00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:43.370\nAnd if we're to go ahead and\nrelaunch Internet Explorer.\n\n277\n00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:47.035\nYou get that notification that says\nInternet Explorer Enhance Security\n\n278\n00:15:47.035 --> 00:15:49.024\nconfiguration is currently enabled.\n\n279\n00:15:49.024 --> 00:15:52.039\nSo we're kind of restricting access,\nin that way.\n\n280\n00:15:52.039 --> 00:15:54.692\nThat's just one of the many\nways we can integrate security.\n\n281\n00:15:54.692 --> 00:15:57.048\nWe mentioned it in a prior show and\n\n282\n00:15:57.048 --> 00:16:02.365\nwe'll continue throughout this series\nto talk about security, as well.\n\n283\n00:16:02.365 --> 00:16:03.045\nWhat else?\n\n284\n00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:04.263\nTime zone.\n\n285\n00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:08.406\nThis is important so I'm currently not\nin London, but these labs are based\n\n286\n00:16:08.406 --> 00:16:12.620\nout of London so that's why you see\nthis particular time zone here.\n\n287\n00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.330\nIt's important to make sure that\nthis information is correct,\n\n288\n00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.940\nespecially if you're utilizing,\nwell here, our Windows environment.\n\n289\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:25.560\nSecurity concepts such as Kerberos that\nare gonna be directly dependent and\n\n290\n00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.600\nother applications and\nsystems within your environment as well.\n\n291\n00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.790\nAnd then you have your product key and\nit notes here that it has been activated.\n\n292\n00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:38.400\nAdditional system information, you can\nfind information about your processors.\n\n293\n00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.110\nThe amount of installed RAM\nthat I have going on here.\n\n294\n00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:45.740\nSo right, I mean just looking\nat all of this information,\n\n295\n00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:51.420\nright here in an easily read format,\nright, from my local server.\n\n296\n00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.770\nBut that's not all.\n\n297\n00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:55.520\nWhat if I wanted to add\nadditional servers.\n\n298\n00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.540\nOver here on the left side\nof my lab environment,\n\n299\n00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.080\nyou can see I've got\nthat domain controller.\n\n300\n00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.830\nI've got a domain member O2.\n\n301\n00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:04.320\nI've got PLABSAO1.\n\n302\n00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.030\nI've got a couple\nWindows10 clients on there.\n\n303\n00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.810\nSo, what if I wanted to add different\nmachines to manage from this\n\n304\n00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:13.970\none server manager interface?\n\n305\n00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:16.360\nThat's fine, I can do that.\n\n306\n00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.740\nSo here let's see what we have so far.\n\n307\n00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.830\nAll servers.\n\n308\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:24.630\nSo within my available server pool\nright here I only have my local server.\n\n309\n00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.890\nSo let's go ahead and\nadd a couple servers.\n\n310\n00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:33.350\nAnd it's simple to do, you just go under\nmanage and then Add servers, all right.\n\n311\n00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:38.890\nAnd because l already know the name\nof my machines within my environment,\n\n312\n00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:42.625\nl can just l don't have to use\nthe fully qualified domain name.\n\n313\n00:17:42.625 --> 00:17:48.530\nI should be able to just do a search\nitself l would type a pl a b dc o1 And\n\n314\n00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.930\nhit find now, it should find it.\n\n315\n00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:51.830\nAnd there it is, right there.\n\n316\n00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.960\nIt tells you the operating\nsystem that it's running.\n\n317\n00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.540\nNow you do need to go ahead and\n\n318\n00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.730\nhit this arrow button to move it\non over to this right hand column.\n\n319\n00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:07.769\nI can do another search here for\nour PLABSA- what else is that, SA01.\n\n320\n00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:13.530\nFind it, all right, and add that,\nas well, make sure it's highlighted, and\n\n321\n00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:14.090\nthen add it.\n\n322\n00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:18.900\nAll right, so now you can see the two\nmachines over on the right-hand side.\n\n323\n00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.326\nAnd then, select OK.\n\n324\n00:18:22.055 --> 00:18:23.090\nAnd.\n\n325\n00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:26.420\nThey're propagating filling in all\nof their information, right here,\n\n326\n00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.380\ninto Server Manager.\n\n327\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.980\nAnd so, if I wanted to deploy,\n\n328\n00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.190\nI could even launch PowerShell\ncmdlets simultaneously.\n\n329\n00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:36.760\nIt's just a really fast way\nto go ahead and do that.\n\n330\n00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:41.290\nBut, what if I wanted to take\nthis to another level and\n\n331\n00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.940\nbreak it down and\norganize it even further.\n\n332\n00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.600\nI also have the ability to\ncreate different groups.\n\n333\n00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.400\nAnd it's really simple as well so it would\nbe right here again in that same spot,\n\n334\n00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.497\nmanage, and\nnow I can select Create Server Group.\n\n335\n00:18:57.063 --> 00:19:02.110\nAnd I can see the different machines that\nI've already added to my server pool here.\n\n336\n00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:06.690\nSo let's just go ahead and\nadd a couple over.\n\n337\n00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:14.840\nWhich ones, my DC and DM,\nadd them over, and the group name.\n\n338\n00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.910\nSo let's just pretend logically.\n\n339\n00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:18.410\nOkay?\n\n340\n00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:21.330\nYou always try to kind of\nmake it relate to something.\n\n341\n00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.940\nSo maybe I'll say domain controllers and\nwe'll pretend that the domain member's\n\n342\n00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:30.250\nactually an additional domain controllers\nso we'll just say like Domain controllers.\n\n343\n00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:37.540\nAnd what that does for\nus is it helps create,\n\n344\n00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.180\nokay I have my refresh failed but\nthat is okay.\n\n345\n00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.186\nWe'll just go ahead and do that again\n\n346\n00:19:45.403 --> 00:19:49.238\nIt creates different organizational\nunits so that I don't get\n\n347\n00:19:49.238 --> 00:19:53.370\nall of the information like I said,\njust thrown at you in one shop.\n\n348\n00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:54.900\nSo now I can go ahead and\n\n349\n00:19:54.900 --> 00:20:00.160\nsee over here on my domain controllers\ndashboard I get a more narrow view.\n\n350\n00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.760\nI'm not looking at things\nfull spectrum here, and\n\n351\n00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.970\nI can really focus my administrative\nefforts to particular groups.\n\n352\n00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.860\nSo that's a really cool thing that\nthey provided for us here as well.\n\n353\n00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.080\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee well that's a lot of\ninteresting things inside of the server\n\n354\n00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.560\nmanager itself, any other things\nthat we might need to know about?\n\n355\n00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:24.440\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie just thinking about taking\na look at where we disabled the IE ESC,\n\n356\n00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.280\nI do have a diagram here that I\npulled from the book and it's kind of\n\n357\n00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.630\ncool just to kind of understand what\nit is you're actually enabling or\n\n358\n00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:34.820\ndisabling here and you can say\n&gt;&gt; You could see that I wasn't able to\n\n359\n00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.540\naccess those particular websites.\n\n360\n00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:42.620\nBut you can actually look at the under\nping components and see, hey look,\n\n361\n00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:47.635\nby enabling or disabling certain features,\nI'm blocking X or unblocking\n\n362\n00:20:47.635 --> 00:20:52.835\nthe ability for scripts to be read,\nI'm blocking any kind of intranets sites,\n\n363\n00:20:52.835 --> 00:20:57.435\nany kind of downloads to be available,\nany kind of additional browser add ons.\n\n364\n00:20:57.435 --> 00:21:00.475\nSo just kinda of referencing the book\n\n365\n00:21:00.475 --> 00:21:05.355\nhere as well in playing around in Server\nManager is gonna give you a good mix of\n\n366\n00:21:05.355 --> 00:21:08.615\nunderstanding what exactly what you\nare doing within this environment.\n\n367\n00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:10.480\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee.\n\n368\n00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:15.120\nWell thank you again for this introduction\nhere into the server manager.\n\n369\n00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:20.030\nIt really is going to be the primary place\nthat we're going to begin understanding\n\n370\n00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.340\nhow to manage as well as access\na lot of the different components,\n\n371\n00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.660\nthat we normally don't see\nas a desktop support person.\n\n372\n00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.521\nOr somebody working in a different part\nof the field or just getting out of A+ or\n\n373\n00:21:30.521 --> 00:21:36.940\nnetwork+, It's, for us, a main tool,\na dashboard that allows us to\n\n374\n00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:42.060\nbe able to access and get access to more\nthan one server but even multiple servers.\n\n375\n00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.460\nThat's probably the environment\nyou will be working in.\n\n376\n00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.950\nSo make sure you pay\nmore attention there and\n\n377\n00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.290\nlearn how to navigate around that as well.\n\n378\n00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.770\nWell, it is a great place for\nus to also sign off.\n\n379\n00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:55.330\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nRonnie Wong.\n\n380\n00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.460\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n381\n00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:01.431\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Windows Server 101 shows.\n\n382\n00:22:01.431 --> 00:22:07.315\n[MUSIC]\n\n383\n00:22:07.315 --> 00:22:10.573\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching\n&gt;&gt; ITPRO.TV\n\n",

Well, thank you for\n\n13\n00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.060\nhaving me back as we take a look at\nthe idea of working with PowerShell.\n\n14\n00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.390\nNow, most of us,\nas we take a look at this series,\n\n15\n00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.180\nright, we might have been\nworking in desktop support.\n\n16\n00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.250\nOr we've really just kind of gotten\nthrough the basics of understanding\n\n17\n00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.940\nthe operation of a computer.\n\n18\n00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.320\nBut as you start needing more and\nmore experience into the server world,\n\n19\n00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.000\nyou're gonna end up in something\nthat we call PowerShell.\n\n20\n00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.650\nNow when you first end up\ntaking a look at PowerShell,\n\n21\n00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.260\nyou're gonna see something\nfamiliar about it, but then\n\n22\n00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.150\nit's gonna actually be a lot more powerful\nthan what we're actually used to instead.\n\n23\n00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.680\nSo let's take a look at my screen for\n\n24\n00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.100\na moment and\nlet me show you what I mean, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.430\nSo when we take a look at\nsomething that looks like this,\n\n26\n00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.380\nit looks just like a command-line\nprompt that we might be familiar with.\n\n27\n00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.711\nAnd so, if I just go ahead and\nbring something like this up,\n\n28\n00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:20.312\nyou'll see here is probably something that\nlooks a little bit more similar to what\n\n29\n00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:23.129\nwe are probably wanting or\nnormally going to see.\n\n30\n00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:27.450\nAnd let me change the color just briefly\nso it pops out a little bit more.\n\n31\n00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.060\nThere we go.\nAnd you go, kind of go, all right, well,\n\n32\n00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.650\nthat's exactly identical.\n\n33\n00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.850\nSo what's the big deal?\n\n34\n00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.684\nI know a little bit about\nthe command line here.\n\n35\n00:01:37.684 --> 00:01:41.610\nAnd the command prompt that iIm giving,\nI know that I can manipulate files.\n\n36\n00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.500\nI can move files.\n\n37\n00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.360\nI can do whatever I need to.\n\n38\n00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.600\nSo, right here,\nI'm inside of that operating system shell.\n\n39\n00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.120\nEverything is good.\n\n40\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.520\nBut, inside of PowerShell, though,\nit is that, and a little bit more.\n\n41\n00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.372\nThe very fact is, for most of us,\nif we're not working with PowerShell,\n\n42\n00:01:58.372 --> 00:02:01.900\nit is something that we are going\nto need to become familiar with.\n\n43\n00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.420\nIt is a primary technology that\nis really Windows itself, and\n\n44\n00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.990\nWindows Server itself is built around, is\nthis idea of the PowerShell that we have.\n\n45\n00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.150\nSo it actually lends itself to commands\n\n46\n00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.050\nthat you can type in just like we could\nfrom the command line that we just saw.\n\n47\n00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.270\nAnd what we're probably\nnormally experienced with.\n\n48\n00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.330\nBut it's also part of something that we\ncan do which we call scripting as well.\n\n49\n00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.240\nIt provides for us a basis of adding in\na scripting language that allows us to\n\n50\n00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.320\nbe able to say hey, here's something\nthat we would need to run.\n\n51\n00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.679\nIt's a lot more than just\nsimple commands that we need.\n\n52\n00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.480\nSo when we start to actually use it,\nyou're probably wondering, well,\n\n53\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.710\nis there something then\nthat I need to learn?\n\n54\n00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.590\nThat I need to know?\n\n55\n00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.360\nYes.\n\n56\n00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.970\nIt's something that inside\nof the world of Windows,\n\n57\n00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.090\nas you continue to move\nforward in your IT career,\n\n58\n00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.290\nyou're gonna need to be able to jump in\nhere and know a little bit more about it.\n\n59\n00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.700\nAnd the neat thing about PowerShell\nis that, it's not just there for\n\n60\n00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.310\nyou to play with and for you to just kind\nof explore and wonder when you'll need it.\n\n61\n00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.250\nYou're gonna see something\nespecially in the administration and\n\n62\n00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.920\nthen management side is something you're\ngonna have to become familiar with.\n\n63\n00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.240\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, not just utilizing\nPowerShell in an every day capacity, but\n\n64\n00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.220\nI've noticed that Microsoft has a,\n\n65\n00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.730\nthey spend a lot of time\ndeveloping this product.\n\n66\n00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.910\nSo if you're planning on taking\nany type of Microsoft exams,\n\n67\n00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.860\nit's definitely something that's going to\nbe covered and not to just dismiss and\n\n68\n00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.670\nsay I'd rather use the GUI.\n\n69\n00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.350\nBecause they're kind\nof training admins and\n\n70\n00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.040\npushing them into that direction, right?\n\n71\n00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.420\n&gt;&gt; That is absolutely true.\n\n72\n00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.680\nEverything that we just about to see\ntoday, especially as you starting heading\n\n73\n00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.201\ntowards those certifications,\nis you're gonna learn something is in\n\n74\n00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:47.430\nthe background of it, it really is\nPowerShell commands that are running.\n\n75\n00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.820\nThe point and click interface that you and\nI have really is just kind of\n\n76\n00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.660\ngetting those commands ready to be sent\nand they're sent over into Powershell, and\n\n77\n00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.940\nthey run as a Powershell command\nthe majority of the times.\n\n78\n00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.500\nAlso on these exams, because\nthe Powershell itself is really the idea\n\n79\n00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.910\nbehind everything, they expect you to\nknow this on those certification exams.\n\n80\n00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.399\nSo it's not something you can go, well,\nI'll just push it off until when I need\n\n81\n00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:15.880\nit, and then after I learn it for\nthe exam, I'll never use it again.\n\n82\n00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.463\nThat is absolutely one of the things\nthat will get you in trouble as you go\n\n83\n00:04:19.463 --> 00:04:21.800\non towards more certifications.\n\n84\n00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.210\nSo if you can get a little bit of\nexperience now and start trying to figure\n\n85\n00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.470\nout how can something be done not only\ninside of the GUI interface, the graphical\n\n86\n00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.820\nuser interface, that we'll be showing you\nthroughout this series a lot of times.\n\n87\n00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.310\nBut also asks the question can\nI do this in PowerShell or\n\n88\n00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.860\ncan something like this\nbe done in PowerShell?\n\n89\n00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.090\nTry and practice this because it's only\ngoing to assist you into the future.\n\n90\n00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.630\nPower shell itself is\nreally designed around\n\n91\n00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.370\nthe focus is on is on IT administration.\n\n92\n00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.770\nIn other words,\ngetting things done relatively quickly.\n\n93\n00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.170\nAutomating the different types of\nadministrative tasks that we have\n\n94\n00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.440\navailable to us so\n\n95\n00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.640\nwe don't have to interact with\nevery single screen that we get.\n\n96\n00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.110\nWe can actually automate it.\n\n97\n00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.720\nAllow it to do all the things that we\nneed to, and not only that though,\n\n98\n00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.930\nwe also don't have to touch\nevery single computer.\n\n99\n00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.150\nWe can even do some remote management,\n\n100\n00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.650\nusing something like\nPowerShell to help us out.\n\n101\n00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.050\nSo let's make sure that we understand how\nwe can connect to the PowerShell itself.\n\n102\n00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.910\nAnd we'll show a couple of different ways,\n\n103\n00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.000\na couple of different interfaces\nthat you may encounter.\n\n104\n00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.100\nSo let's take a look at my screen\nagain and we'll get started here.\n\n105\n00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.100\nI'm gonna park that down here\non the task bar for right now.\n\n106\n00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.780\nWe're gonna be using that a little\nbit later on in the show.\n\n107\n00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.880\nI made what we call\na remote connection into\n\n108\n00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.600\nthe server that I'm gonna be\nsending some commands into.\n\n109\n00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.570\nBut if this is your first experience, and\nyou're inside of the server environment\n\n110\n00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.690\nitself and you need to launch PowerShell,\nwell, it's relatively simple to do so.\n\n111\n00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.960\nI like clicking on, of course, the Search\nWindows icon down on the taskbar and\n\n112\n00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.280\njust typing in PowerShell.\n\n113\n00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.190\nNow, when I do that, you'll notice, see\nif I can zoom in a little bit more here.\n\n114\n00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.840\nYou'll notice that there's, well,\na couple of different options.\n\n115\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.320\nActually four different options\nthat you see right here.\n\n116\n00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.720\nSo Cherokee, as we start seeing this,\nit's kind of neat, right,\n\n117\n00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.080\nthat we end up seeing an x86 here\nas well as the idea of these two.\n\n118\n00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.610\nDo you know what the difference\nis between those two?\n\n119\n00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the regular PowerShell is\nprobably what you'll be using most of\n\n120\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.875\nthe time unless you utilize\nscripting quite a bit.\n\n121\n00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:32.810\nAnd the ISE,\nthe integrated scripting environment,\n\n122\n00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.730\nis going to be a little bit more towards\nthe scripting side where you can save and\n\n123\n00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.480\nretain especially if you have\na long string of syntax there.\n\n124\n00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.380\n&gt;&gt; And what about the x86 [INAUDIBLE] do.\n\n125\n00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.050\n&gt;&gt; For the x86, I really don't\nuse it too much so I don't know.\n\n126\n00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.680\nWhat are you gonna tell us about that,\nRonnie?\n\n127\n00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is if you're still\nrunning in a 32-bit environment.\n\n128\n00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.410\nNow, most of us are probably\nnot going to be doing that, but\n\n129\n00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:02.130\nif you are connecting into an older\nserver which can run some PowerShell,\n\n130\n00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.150\nbut it is a 32-bit environment, here's\nwhere you can also do the same things.\n\n131\n00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.160\nSo even though most of the machines today\nare in that architecture that we call\n\n132\n00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.900\na 64-bit environment, and they should\naccept all of the commands that we have,\n\n133\n00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.030\nif it doesn't work up here, you go, I\nknow that this command's supposed to run.\n\n134\n00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.510\nTry and run some of these other ones and\ninstead and\n\n135\n00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.770\nsee if your command will run down\nhere when you're trying to do that,\n\n136\n00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.290\nespecially if you're connecting\ninto a remote machine.\n\n137\n00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.690\nBut launching this is fairly simple.\n\n138\n00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.160\nI simply select that, let me zoom out and\nthat way we can see it.\n\n139\n00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.980\nAnd you can see where,\nthat's the window that I just showed you.\n\n140\n00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.580\nIt really does look fairly similar to what\nwe see in just a regular command line.\n\n141\n00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.370\nSo I can do some of the same things\nthat I've learned about, let's say,\n\n142\n00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.720\nin my A+ and\nmy network plus studies, right?\n\n143\n00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.171\nSo if I take, for an example here,\n\n144\n00:07:49.171 --> 00:07:54.764\nI wanted to list out the contents of this\nfolder, I can do a dir and look at that.\n\n145\n00:07:54.764 --> 00:07:56.108\nIt actually lists it out for us.\n\n146\n00:07:56.108 --> 00:08:01.239\nSo we do have that command ready and\navailable for us to be able to do.\n\n147\n00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:05.114\nNow some of the other things though,\nwe can continue to do that and\n\n148\n00:08:05.114 --> 00:08:09.907\nin this particular environment as we start\nseeing it, it really does give us this\n\n149\n00:08:09.907 --> 00:08:14.120\nability to run commands when we\nknow that we need to run a command.\n\n150\n00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.354\nWe'll talk about commands and commandlets\nin a moment, but overall though,\n\n151\n00:08:17.354 --> 00:08:19.124\nlet's just make sure that we understand.\n\n152\n00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:23.720\nWe can run commands from this one, and\nthis is great, so we know we can do that.\n\n153\n00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.850\nNow, what Cherokee was also talking.\n\n154\n00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:30.710\nLet me type in PowerShell again and\nselect this window instead.\n\n155\n00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.910\nLet me see if I can\nchange the view just for\n\n156\n00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.850\na moment to make it\na little bit easier here.\n\n157\n00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.690\nOptions and\nI'll just change the font size.\n\n158\n00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:42.740\nI'll say up to about a 16 point here\nto make it a little bit easier.\n\n159\n00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.350\nNotice that this one, this is the,\nwhat did you call it?\n\n160\n00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.850\nISE?\n&gt;&gt; ISE.\n\n161\n00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.175\n&gt;&gt; Is what you call it?\n\n162\n00:08:47.175 --> 00:08:50.920\nI-S-E stands for\nIntegrated Scripting Engine.\n\n163\n00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.170\nIs that correct?\n\n164\n00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:52.730\nEnvironment?\n\n165\n00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.820\n&gt;&gt; Environment?\n&gt;&gt; Environment, Engine, Environment.\n\n166\n00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:55.340\nYeah.\n\n167\n00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.300\nSo one of those two,\nthat we have available to us.\n\n168\n00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.650\nNow, if I type up here\nin the scripting window\n\n169\n00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:07.440\nit's not gonna run a command so\nlet me do something like this.\n\n170\n00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.820\nSo let's say I do a DIR and I press enter,\nnotice it didn't do anything and\n\n171\n00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.510\nthat is because it's allowing me to type\nout all the commands that I want to but\n\n172\n00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.310\nnot yet really run them.\n\n173\n00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.450\nIf I wanted to run something like this,\nI simply select that line.\n\n174\n00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.200\nAnd then I can press the little play\nbutton up here, and now notice.\n\n175\n00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.000\nThis gives you a chance\nto check your syntax out.\n\n176\n00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.360\nAnd if you do have a fairly involved\namount of commands that you want to run,\n\n177\n00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.620\nbut you know that they have to be tied\ntogether, this is a great way to do so.\n\n178\n00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.830\nSo using that scripting language,\nbeing able to go out onto the internet and\n\n179\n00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:45.400\nfind those guides that are out\nthere to help you to do this.\n\n180\n00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.840\nRunning it here first allows you to\ngo back and check your syntax and\n\n181\n00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.810\nthen when you are ready to go,\nit will execute and\n\n182\n00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.670\nit will show you the results\ndown here in the bottom pane.\n\n183\n00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.050\nNow if I wanted to come down\nhere to the bottom pane,\n\n184\n00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.400\ncan I still do the same thing?\n\n185\n00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.360\nSure thing.\n\n186\n00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.190\nSo it really does allow you that focus\nin what you want to be able to do.\n\n187\n00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.450\nSo remember the two\ndistinguishing differences here.\n\n188\n00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:11.380\nIf I know I really just want to run\nthe command right away, then I can just\n\n189\n00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:16.210\nlaunch the PowerShell itself and if I know\nthat I'm going to be adding in more and\n\n190\n00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.800\nmore commands or I have a particular\nscript that needs to run,\n\n191\n00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:25.170\nI may choose to copy and\npaste it into the PowerShell ISE instead.\n\n192\n00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.468\nGo through,\nverify that everything is good.\n\n193\n00:10:27.468 --> 00:10:31.020\nHopefully if you're copying, and\npasting does nothing wrong with it, but\n\n194\n00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.930\nmake sure that everything is the way that\nyou want it, and then go through and\n\n195\n00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.550\nbe able to press the play button and\nrun that script as well.\n\n196\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.683\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie that sounds great especially for\ndevelopers.\n\n197\n00:10:40.683 --> 00:10:43.410\nSo you can go ahead like you said,\nverify your syntax, and\n\n198\n00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.940\nperhaps even the sequence of\nthose particular scripts as well.\n\n199\n00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:51.240\nBut when we talk about PowerShell syntax,\nit's got a unique structure.\n\n200\n00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.390\nSo from a maybe someone who is\nmore familiar with developing or\n\n201\n00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.095\nprogramming, what does that\nstructure look like to us?\n\n202\n00:10:58.095 --> 00:11:01.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthe neat thing about the commands right,\n\n203\n00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.340\nunlike what we've learned about in\nlet's say just the command line proper,\n\n204\n00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.110\ngetting to the access,\nto the shell where we run simple commands,\n\n205\n00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.770\nipconfig we can run from\nthe command prompt.\n\n206\n00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.100\nJust like I showed you had DIR for\nlisting in directories.\n\n207\n00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.770\nThose are simple but you have to memorize\nall of them before you can get very far\n\n208\n00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.070\nin doing a lot inside of\nthe command line itself.\n\n209\n00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:27.345\nBut in PowerShell they have a very simple\nstructure as far as the commands go.\n\n210\n00:11:27.345 --> 00:11:31.720\nIt's always in what we\ncall a verb noun syntax.\n\n211\n00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.990\nLet me show you an example\nright here on my screen.\n\n212\n00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.070\nThis is not the most\nbeautiful of diagrams I have,\n\n213\n00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.510\nbut let me show you what you\nnormally end up seeing here right?\n\n214\n00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:43.780\nSo it normally begins with\na verb in terms of the command\n\n215\n00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.020\nyou also usually get a dash here.\n\n216\n00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.400\nAnd then whatever the actual\nnoun is going to be.\n\n217\n00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.720\nSo you can do a get and a dash,\nand then you might do service.\n\n218\n00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.970\nSo it shouldn't have a get and\nlet's say, get and set.\n\n219\n00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:01.990\nSo get-set would be kind of unusual\nsince those are both verbs.\n\n220\n00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.790\nSo notice that this one has that, so\nthese are fairly two popular commands.\n\n221\n00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:10.740\nAnd I wanted to show these specifically at\nthe very beginning because it really is,\n\n222\n00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.410\nit's a very powerful way.\n\n223\n00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.140\nIf you just need to see what's\nthere this is a key word for\n\n224\n00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.550\nus, is get, get this show it to me.\n\n225\n00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:23.050\nSo let's show you what we're talking\nabout here to make that happen.\n\n226\n00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.500\nLet me go back over to my machine and\n\n227\n00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:30.020\nwe'll, I'm gonna bring up\nthat PowerShell prompt again.\n\n228\n00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.610\nOops, did I open two?\n\n229\n00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:32.730\nMust have opened two windows here.\n\n230\n00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.140\nLet me see if I can\nshut one of those down.\n\n231\n00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.510\nChange the following here and\nlet me see, yep.\n\n232\n00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.040\nNo, I'm not gonna worry about that.\n\n233\n00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.660\nSo that will bring me back to this one.\n\n234\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.930\nThere we go.\n\n235\n00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.160\nThat's what I wanted.\n\n236\n00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:50.690\nSo from here if I type in\nget-service as an example.\n\n237\n00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:54.930\nYou'll see where it\nlisted every single one\n\n238\n00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:58.770\nof the services that\nare running on this server.\n\n239\n00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:02.810\nSo from just this simple two line command,\nit displayed for\n\n240\n00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:08.190\nme all of the information regarding the\nstatus, whether a service is stopped or\n\n241\n00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:12.930\nrunning or whatever it might be,\nthe name of that service that recognizes.\n\n242\n00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:16.420\nIn other words the way that\nPowerShell can actually call upon it.\n\n243\n00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.280\nAnd then even the way it's\ndisplayed to you and I.\n\n244\n00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:24.240\nSo you'll actually end up seeing sometimes\nwhere you won't get a display name that\n\n245\n00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.840\nactually looks exactly like the the name,\nfor example the AllJoyn Router Service,\n\n246\n00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.588\nokay this is just the way that\nit's actually inside of WIndows is\n\n247\n00:13:34.588 --> 00:13:38.960\nAJRrouter instead, or if I scroll down to\nsomething a little bit more popular here,\n\n248\n00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.670\nlook Dhcp, so you can see DHCP Client.\n\n249\n00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.840\n&gt;&gt; Straight forward.\n\n250\n00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.660\n&gt;&gt; Pretty straight forward here,\nbut it's just fairly\n\n251\n00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.359\nin that syntax of what you end up seeing\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of\n\n252\n00:13:51.359 --> 00:13:54.010\ninformation that you get very easily.\n\n253\n00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.800\nI normally like picking on\nthe print server because that's\n\n254\n00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.310\nnormally the one that\n&gt;&gt; That's funny.\n\n255\n00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:59.723\n&gt;&gt; That we see\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna use that for\n\n256\n00:13:59.723 --> 00:14:01.803\nour example for a little bit later\n&gt;&gt; Okay so\n\n257\n00:14:01.803 --> 00:14:03.295\nI won't pick on it too much, there you go.\n\n258\n00:14:03.295 --> 00:14:06.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can actually see all these services\n\n259\n00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.980\nthat get you to that point\n&gt;&gt; But once you learn that, and\n\n260\n00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.530\nonce you learn that get command,\nthat very first one,\n\n261\n00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:17.130\nI can get to a point because PowerShell\nis really trying to be helpful.\n\n262\n00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.680\nI can do this get-,\nlet me zoom in a little bit more so\n\n263\n00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.090\nthat we can see it, there we go.\n\n264\n00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.380\nAnd then, I can also do what\nwe call the tab completion.\n\n265\n00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.320\n&gt;&gt; This is really cool.\n\n266\n00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\nIt really allows me,\n\n267\n00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.810\neven if I dont know anything else\nlike what am I going to get here?\n\n268\n00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:37.910\nNotice I can actually get well just\nabout anything that's listed there.\n\n269\n00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.670\nAnd it will go through\nevery single command.\n\n270\n00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.983\nNow if you wanted to make this\na little bit faster of course,\n\n271\n00:14:42.983 --> 00:14:44.515\nyou can just begin typing.\n\n272\n00:14:44.515 --> 00:14:48.480\nSo let us say I know it's\ngotta be service or something.\n\n273\n00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.010\nAnd then it will fill out the rest for us.\n\n274\n00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.950\nSo, thank you, tab complete is what I say.\n\n275\n00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:57.390\nBecause it means I don't have to learn\nwhat every single command, like what we\n\n276\n00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:01.200\nwere talking about in the command line,\nwhere it was like, is that a DIR or\n\n277\n00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.650\nwas that LS since I moved over from the,\nI don't remember what the command is.\n\n278\n00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.577\nWell, I'm kind of toast at that poiint\nif I don't know what the command is.\n\n279\n00:15:07.577 --> 00:15:12.415\nBut here, I can start off with Get- and\ngo I don't know what that is,\n\n280\n00:15:12.415 --> 00:15:15.310\nand it really doesn't help too much.\n\n281\n00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.410\nThe other thing, and we'll do this\na little bit later as well, but\n\n282\n00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:22.020\nlet's say that I go hey,\nI don't know what I'm trying to do.\n\n283\n00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:29.623\nI can even use a help- command, and\nthen from that point, let's see Get.\n\n284\n00:15:29.623 --> 00:15:32.840\nOkay, actually,\nthat brings up a good point.\n\n285\n00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.430\nSo, there may be times,\ncuz I wanted to show this to,\n\n286\n00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.598\nthere are times when it's like,\nif you get it completely wrong,\n\n287\n00:15:38.598 --> 00:15:41.501\nit will just spill out red and\nblack all across your screen.\n\n288\n00:15:41.501 --> 00:15:44.210\nTrying to say, hey look,\nyou can't do that.\n\n289\n00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.960\nBut let me show you an example\nof what you might try to do.\n\n290\n00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.980\nSo that way you can go look.\n\n291\n00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.950\nI don't know what all the commands are, so\n\n292\n00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.370\nlet's just do what I was\ndoing a little bit earlier.\n\n293\n00:15:53.370 --> 00:16:00.187\nGet-help.\n\n294\n00:16:00.187 --> 00:16:03.195\nSo this way, help-.\n\n295\n00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:06.342\nNow I'm gonna mess up here.\n\n296\n00:16:06.342 --> 00:16:07.820\nService, or is it?\n\n297\n00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.525\nNo, it's not help dash, is it?\n\n298\n00:16:09.525 --> 00:16:11.580\nIt's help and then get.\n\n299\n00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.270\nService, there we go.\n\n300\n00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.504\nSee, I put a dash in there and\nthat kind of lets you know.\n\n301\n00:16:16.504 --> 00:16:19.768\nSo if you play around just a little\nbit enough, you can really get some\n\n302\n00:16:19.768 --> 00:16:23.405\ninformation on how stuff ends up working-\n&gt;&gt; And they do a pretty good job as to\n\n303\n00:16:23.405 --> 00:16:26.690\nletting you know usually where\nin that syntax you've messed up.\n\n304\n00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.970\nYou can go back and check your work there.\n\n305\n00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:33.752\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and that's why just playing around\nwith it will really help you out if you'll\n\n306\n00:16:33.752 --> 00:16:36.299\nat least get started here to try and\ndo that.\n\n307\n00:16:36.299 --> 00:16:39.683\nSo for example, when you start doing\nthings like this and you start\n\n308\n00:16:39.683 --> 00:16:43.501\ngetting a little bit in trouble, take\na look at some what you see in the red.\n\n309\n00:16:43.501 --> 00:16:46.864\nIt's not gonna help you all the time,\nespecially if it gets super long and\n\n310\n00:16:46.864 --> 00:16:48.500\nyou're not real familiar with it.\n\n311\n00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.680\nBut as you become more\nfamiliar with it and\n\n312\n00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.370\nworking with it,\nthat's what will end up helping.\n\n313\n00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:56.223\nAnd you see that all I did here was,\nI actually forgot.\n\n314\n00:16:56.223 --> 00:16:58.627\nThere was no dash in\nbetween the idea of help.\n\n315\n00:16:58.627 --> 00:17:01.399\nSo you can get some help and\nthe syntax itself, and\n\n316\n00:17:01.399 --> 00:17:04.040\nyou'll actually see that\nthere's more to it.\n\n317\n00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:08.705\nSo if I press my spacebar,\nyou'll even see other things.\n\n318\n00:17:08.705 --> 00:17:10.370\nNew-Service, Restart,\n\n319\n00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:15.470\nthese are all the actual commands that are\nalso related to the word service as well.\n\n320\n00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.240\nAnd here's even some other remarks,\n\n321\n00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:22.110\nsome examples that we can see that\nwill really help us out a lot too.\n\n322\n00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:27.080\nNow when we start to take a look, right,\nand see some of the power behind this,\n\n323\n00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.420\nthe power itself, a lot of times,\nespecially for you and I beginning to work\n\n324\n00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:37.130\ninside of the actual server world,\nis to understand something that\n\n325\n00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:42.130\nnot every command that we are going to\nrun is gonna only be on this one machine.\n\n326\n00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:47.750\nSo for example, right here, if I type in\na command I know that shouldn't work here.\n\n327\n00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:56.140\nLet me do for an example get -aduser,\nand then identity here, and joey.\n\n328\n00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:02.560\nNow if I do this, okay, this get -aduser,\nlet's see what happens here.\n\n329\n00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:06.920\nI'm expecting a red to spew out just\na little bit, if I can get it to run.\n\n330\n00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.720\nSometimes I have to kind of, there we go.\n\n331\n00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.470\nSo there, it's not running,\nit doesn't work.\n\n332\n00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.920\nAnd I expected that to end up happening.\n\n333\n00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:21.180\nAnd the reason why is that this particular\ncommand is not available for this machine.\n\n334\n00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.090\nIt just doesn't like it.\n\n335\n00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:27.031\nSo you can see where it says the term\nget-aduser is not recognized as part\n\n336\n00:18:27.031 --> 00:18:27.926\nof the name.\n\n337\n00:18:27.926 --> 00:18:32.889\nBut let me show you another connection\nthat I've actually made here on this one.\n\n338\n00:18:32.889 --> 00:18:39.850\nAnd if I typed in the very same\ncommand here, get -aduser,\n\n339\n00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:45.151\nthen I'm gonna do a -identity -joey here.\n\n340\n00:18:45.151 --> 00:18:49.170\nWhoop, le tme see if I can zoom a little\nbit better so that we can see that.\n\n341\n00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:54.262\nget -aduser identity, or\nnot -joey here, I just need joey.\n\n342\n00:18:57.009 --> 00:19:02.900\nNow, look, that actually changed, and\nI got some information back as well.\n\n343\n00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.320\n&gt;&gt; Because joey exists within\nthis particular domain,\n\n344\n00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.530\nnot in the other domain?\n\n345\n00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.180\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's not in the other domain,\nbut on another computer.\n\n346\n00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:15.470\nAnd this is where you might end up seeing,\nfor example, right here at the very\n\n347\n00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.600\nbeginning we're saying, hey,\nI'm connecting to another machine.\n\n348\n00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.180\nThis particular machine is not\nthe same as this name right here.\n\n349\n00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:29.080\nSo I'm running this command getting that\ninformation from that other machine,\n\n350\n00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.270\nand that's something that we can also do.\n\n351\n00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.756\nThat's the idea of that remote\nmanagement we were talking about.\n\n352\n00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:37.090\nIt's great for administrative\ntask on individual machines.\n\n353\n00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:38.990\nBut inside of server environments,\n\n354\n00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:43.282\nyou're gonna see managing multiple servers\nat times, getting those things run,\n\n355\n00:19:43.282 --> 00:19:46.300\nmeans you're gonna have to\nmake connections over there.\n\n356\n00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.594\nNow we're not doing that right now.\n\n357\n00:19:48.594 --> 00:19:50.561\nBut we will show you that\na little bit later on,\n\n358\n00:19:50.561 --> 00:19:52.743\nespecially when we get\ninto the Active Directory.\n\n359\n00:19:52.743 --> 00:19:55.958\nAnd that was an example of using\nActive Directory to help us out a little\n\n360\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:56.980\nbit here.\n\n361\n00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:01.270\nBut you'll end up seeing that,\nthat this really is giving you that\n\n362\n00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:05.710\nability to do administrative tasks even\nremotely on other machines as well.\n\n363\n00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:10.180\nSometimes, though, you're even\nconnecting out to Cloud services too,\n\n364\n00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.810\nwhere the commands don't\nactually exist on your systems.\n\n365\n00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:17.260\nAnd when something like that happens,\nyou'll have to import in the module.\n\n366\n00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:18.730\nAnd when you do something like that,\n\n367\n00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:23.960\nthat will give you additional commands\nthat weren't available on you machines.\n\n368\n00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.398\nSo depending on where\nyou're connecting to,\n\n369\n00:20:26.398 --> 00:20:29.592\nyou may find that you don't\nhave those commands available.\n\n370\n00:20:29.592 --> 00:20:33.582\nAnd you'll run a command that\nwill say import-module and\n\n371\n00:20:33.582 --> 00:20:38.399\nthe name of that service that you're\npulling that information from.\n\n372\n00:20:38.399 --> 00:20:41.969\nAnd that will add in additional\nfunctionality on your machine as well.\n\n373\n00:20:41.969 --> 00:20:44.978\nSo there's a lot of\npower behind PowerShell,\n\n374\n00:20:44.978 --> 00:20:47.147\nkind of ironic there in the name.\n\n375\n00:20:47.147 --> 00:20:51.970\nBut that's what we get is that\nability to do certain things, okay?\n\n376\n00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:56.459\nNow let's talk about the syntax\na little bit more as well, okay?\n\n377\n00:20:56.459 --> 00:21:00.177\nSo there's going to be, and\nI always mix these things up, Cherokee.\n\n378\n00:21:00.177 --> 00:21:02.457\nSo when we start doing this,\n\n379\n00:21:02.457 --> 00:21:07.973\nyou'll hear people refer to commandlets,\nC-M-D-L-E-T-S.\n\n380\n00:21:07.973 --> 00:21:09.357\n&gt;&gt; I know, that's a cute little name.\n\n381\n00:21:09.357 --> 00:21:11.155\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a cute little name, and\n\n382\n00:21:11.155 --> 00:21:15.775\nthen you'll hear the term commands itself\nwhen you start doing something like that.\n\n383\n00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:20.870\nSo do you know what the difference is\nbetween a commandlet and a command itself?\n\n384\n00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:25.799\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so your commands are gonna be old\nschool working with the command prompt.\n\n385\n00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:29.266\nAnd those, you'll hear people\ncall them utilities sometimes.\n\n386\n00:21:29.266 --> 00:21:32.841\nAnd then commandlets are part of that\nstructure that you just showed us with\n\n387\n00:21:32.841 --> 00:21:36.690\nthe verb noun structure that we\nshould be using inside of PowerShell.\n\n388\n00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:39.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, overall, though,\nwe just showed you an example, right?\n\n389\n00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:43.030\nThe very cmdlet itself is the get-service.\n\n390\n00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.210\nLet's go back and\ntake a look at that again.\n\n391\n00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:52.020\nSo if I do a get-service here and\njust run that, there it is.\n\n392\n00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.150\nI just ran a cmdlet is what I did.\n\n393\n00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:59.920\nBut I also just showed\nyou if I do a get-aduser,\n\n394\n00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.890\nwell, that is,\nlet me see if I can zoom down here.\n\n395\n00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:06.110\nLet me clear this off.\n\n396\n00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.590\nSo I'll do a CLS to clear that off.\n\n397\n00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:10.630\nMove it towards the top of the screen,\nif I can find it again.\n\n398\n00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.970\nThere we go, and zoom in.\n\n399\n00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:18.482\nIf I do a get-aduser with the identity,\n\n400\n00:22:18.482 --> 00:22:22.280\ntelling it I wanna separate\nit out to one identity and\n\n401\n00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:27.810\nusing joey here, well, this whole\nthing now becomes an actual command.\n\n402\n00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.690\nSo there are commandlets, and\nwhen somebody is looking for\n\n403\n00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:35.182\nthe right syntax to use as\nfar as the commandlet goes,\n\n404\n00:22:35.182 --> 00:22:38.765\nthey're saying,\nwhat is going to give me what I want?\n\n405\n00:22:38.765 --> 00:22:43.697\nAnd the rest of this completion, right,\nthe information that we want it to help us\n\n406\n00:22:43.697 --> 00:22:48.139\nfind, it is the whole thing itself\nthat is considered an actual command.\n\n407\n00:22:48.139 --> 00:22:52.256\nAnd that's what brings everything together\nfor what we want to be able to do.\n\n408\n00:22:52.256 --> 00:22:57.081\nNow by itself, right,\nit gives us a lot of information.\n\n409\n00:22:57.081 --> 00:22:58.734\nBut at the same time, though,\n\n410\n00:22:58.734 --> 00:23:03.240\nwe start finding out that it's fairly\nlimited just like what we saw here.\n\n411\n00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.910\nThe very fact is we can't do a lot\njust with some of this information.\n\n412\n00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:09.130\nYou can find out information,\n\n413\n00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:12.830\nwhich is good if your whole goal\nis finding information out.\n\n414\n00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:17.055\nBut what if you wanted to actually be\nable to do, well, a little bit more?\n\n415\n00:23:17.055 --> 00:23:18.960\nSo let's do an example.\n\n416\n00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:24.490\nget-service, that gives me everything,\nbut I don't need everything.\n\n417\n00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:28.680\nLet's say that what I\nreally need though is this.\n\n418\n00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.800\nBut for me to find that a little\nbit easier, let me try and\n\n419\n00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.650\nsort this thing, okay?\n\n420\n00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:37.180\nSo if I do a get-service again,\n\n421\n00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:43.210\nI can now use a special\ncharacter right here,\n\n422\n00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:46.380\nwhich is called the pipe, and we'll\nget into piping a little bit later on.\n\n423\n00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:50.085\nBut just take a look at it,\nthen I can add in another command,\n\n424\n00:23:50.085 --> 00:23:54.410\nsort-object.\n\n425\n00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:56.730\nThen I can tell it descending instead.\n\n426\n00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:00.704\nIf I can spell descending.\n\n427\n00:24:00.704 --> 00:24:06.115\nAnd now you'll actually end up\nseeing where I've changed this.\n\n428\n00:24:06.115 --> 00:24:08.138\nSort, did I do descending,\nthere it goes, yep.\n\n429\n00:24:08.138 --> 00:24:10.323\n&gt;&gt; So\nwhat you're doing is your querying, but\n\n430\n00:24:10.323 --> 00:24:14.577\nyou're setting additional parameters to\nview that information in a way that's most\n\n431\n00:24:14.577 --> 00:24:16.542\nhelpful to you.`\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n432\n00:24:16.542 --> 00:24:20.854\nyou're actually sorting this and then\nyou're saying, hey, let's go ahead and\n\n433\n00:24:20.854 --> 00:24:23.803\nsort this by the descending\norder when you start the CS.\n\n434\n00:24:23.803 --> 00:24:25.560\nSo you actually end up\ngetting some of these.\n\n435\n00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.887\nAnd what I did is, I forgot to\nname exactly what I wanted here.\n\n436\n00:24:28.887 --> 00:24:31.530\nSo now,\nit's not sure what it's sorting by.\n\n437\n00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:37.345\nSo I needed to add in one more line\nhere of data, is what I needed to do.\n\n438\n00:24:37.345 --> 00:24:39.595\nSo let me clear this off again.\n\n439\n00:24:39.595 --> 00:24:43.864\nAnd we'll add in just a little bit\nmore information is what we'll end up\n\n440\n00:24:43.864 --> 00:24:45.440\nseeing here.\n\n441\n00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.533\nSo I need the sort object and\n\n442\n00:24:47.533 --> 00:24:51.908\nthen I need to add in one more\nparameter because I forgot.\n\n443\n00:24:51.908 --> 00:24:55.705\nThis one, I want it by the property and\n\n444\n00:24:55.705 --> 00:25:01.290\nI'm gonna tell it I want it\nsorted by the status itself.\n\n445\n00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:07.656\nSo I forgot one little utility and that's\nwhy you didn't actually see really any\n\n446\n00:25:07.656 --> 00:25:12.718\ndescending order as I start status,\nOf dash descending.\n\n447\n00:25:12.718 --> 00:25:14.413\nSee, that's what happens here.\n\n448\n00:25:14.413 --> 00:25:15.900\nThere we go.\n\n449\n00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.959\nSo that's a little bit better for\nwhat we're taking a look at So\n\n450\n00:25:19.959 --> 00:25:23.720\nyou can see now where all,\nif I can ever get back up to it.\n\n451\n00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:29.530\nIt should actually end up taking the\nstatus here and sorting it descendingly.\n\n452\n00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.623\nSo it has to do it in a kind\nof an unusual way, right.\n\n453\n00:25:32.623 --> 00:25:35.449\nIt has to take a look at\nthe status first and then each and\n\n454\n00:25:35.449 --> 00:25:39.400\nevery individual column as it goes\nthrough and what it needs to do.\n\n455\n00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.192\nBut that’s where you start doing more and\n\n456\n00:25:42.192 --> 00:25:46.032\nmore information as it comes\nin line to what we want to do.\n\n457\n00:25:46.032 --> 00:25:50.925\nSo that is just a little bit of some\nof the syntax that we have available.\n\n458\n00:25:50.925 --> 00:25:52.347\nWe want to talk about one other thing.\n\n459\n00:25:52.347 --> 00:25:55.868\nI know that we're getting close on\nthe end of time for this section and\n\n460\n00:25:55.868 --> 00:25:59.960\nwe still have a little bit to go so we\nmay end up taking a little bit more here.\n\n461\n00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.513\nBut let's talk about some of the symbols\nthat we'll end up using inside of\n\n462\n00:26:03.513 --> 00:26:04.670\nPowerShell, as well.\n\n463\n00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:08.672\nSo there's a few symbols that you\nare going to encounter when it comes\n\n464\n00:26:08.672 --> 00:26:10.450\nacross PowerShell.\n\n465\n00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:17.219\nSometimes, you will end up seeing, let me\nbring up that that CS, that ISE again.\n\n466\n00:26:17.219 --> 00:26:21.520\nSo you will end up seeing symbols\nlike the back tick mark, okay?\n\n467\n00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.819\nSo when you do something like\nwith the back tick mark here,\n\n468\n00:26:25.819 --> 00:26:28.555\nthis allows you, okay on a command.\n\n469\n00:26:28.555 --> 00:26:32.120\nLet's say that you wanted it all on one\nline, but it doesn't fit on one line.\n\n470\n00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.310\nSo it allows us to, to do that.\n\n471\n00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.401\nSo used in a long command.\n\n472\n00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:47.435\nThat is to be continued, All on one line.\n\n473\n00:26:47.435 --> 00:26:51.943\nSometimes, the commands that you type out,\nthey're really long, and you might go,\n\n474\n00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:55.370\ndid I just hit Enter and\ndid that break the command inside itself-\n\n475\n00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:56.853\n&gt;&gt; Looks like they kinda wrap around.\n\n476\n00:26:56.853 --> 00:27:00.240\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it allows you to do that,\nthat idea of the wrap around.\n\n477\n00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.657\n&gt;&gt; The other one of course is actually,\nwell a dollar sign and\n\n478\n00:27:03.657 --> 00:27:08.608\nyou saw that on this one, when I type that\ndollar sign, something else inside the ISE\n\n479\n00:27:08.608 --> 00:27:12.404\npopped up which says look,\nthat’s a command that I recognize.\n\n480\n00:27:12.404 --> 00:27:16.360\nSo let me go ahead and show you that\nyou can just simply use that as well.\n\n481\n00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:21.964\nWell this one declares a variable, okay.\n\n482\n00:27:21.964 --> 00:27:26.675\nAnd then there's a couple of other ones\nthat's a little bit more confusing here.\n\n483\n00:27:26.675 --> 00:27:30.600\nThere of course are the fancy brackets,\nor the Carly brackets here.\n\n484\n00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:36.702\nAnd this encloses a block of code.\n\n485\n00:27:36.702 --> 00:27:39.710\nOkay, clode, a block of clode.\n\n486\n00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.535\n&gt;&gt; And this one can really get\nyou too if you're not careful.\n\n487\n00:27:42.535 --> 00:27:44.985\nYou think you went through and\ntyped all of your syntax and\n\n488\n00:27:44.985 --> 00:27:47.970\nthen, you forgot the closing bracket or\nsomething like that.\n\n489\n00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:52.507\nSo you need both of them to go ahead and\ncomplete that, those brackets.\n\n490\n00:27:52.507 --> 00:27:54.336\n&gt;&gt; Yes you do, and\nnormally when you see this,\n\n491\n00:27:54.336 --> 00:27:57.140\nespecially in the scripting\nthat you see in PowerShell.\n\n492\n00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.811\nThey'd only put this on\nan individual line and\n\n493\n00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:03.312\nthen the closing one on its own\nline outside the code as well.\n\n494\n00:28:03.312 --> 00:28:04.416\nSo you'll see that too.\n\n495\n00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:07.013\nAnd we normally see that\nwith the word where, okay.\n\n496\n00:28:09.811 --> 00:28:15.298\nWith where, and then, of course, there\nare, well, the regular parenthesis, right.\n\n497\n00:28:15.298 --> 00:28:22.230\nSo if I want to run this first\nbefore the rest of whatever I see.\n\n498\n00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.941\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like our order of operations.\n\n499\n00:28:23.941 --> 00:28:25.152\n&gt;&gt; It is an order of operations.\n\n500\n00:28:25.152 --> 00:28:27.540\nThat's exactly what\nends up happening here.\n\n501\n00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.878\nSo if you want to execute something first,\nor a group expression, or whatever it is,\n\n502\n00:28:31.878 --> 00:28:34.185\nyou can also use that\ninside of there as well.\n\n503\n00:28:34.185 --> 00:28:35.347\nAnd then there's a couple of other ones.\n\n504\n00:28:35.347 --> 00:28:38.250\nNow some of these I haven't\nreally needed to use.\n\n505\n00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:41.284\nFor example like a semicolon here right.\n\n506\n00:28:41.284 --> 00:28:43.039\nSo if I wanted to use a semicolon,\n\n507\n00:28:43.039 --> 00:28:46.070\nthis allows me to run multiple\ncommands on a single line.\n\n508\n00:28:52.481 --> 00:28:56.154\nOn a single line, and then there's\njust a couple of other ones, too,\n\n509\n00:28:56.154 --> 00:28:58.040\nthat we want to point out.\n\n510\n00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:03.793\nSo if you're using a percent sign, this\nis if you're actually gonna use an alias,\n\n511\n00:29:03.793 --> 00:29:08.640\nokay, inside of a little bit of\na programming thing here inside of a for\n\n512\n00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.959\neach object, so using an alias,\n\n513\n00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.302\nIn a for each object, oops, for each.\n\n514\n00:29:20.302 --> 00:29:24.861\n[BLANK AUDIO].\n\n515\n00:29:24.861 --> 00:29:26.736\n-Object, there it is.\n\n516\n00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:33.595\nYou can also click and do that, and the\nlast one that we really want to point out,\n\n517\n00:29:33.595 --> 00:29:36.235\nof course, is just a question\nmark which is another one.\n\n518\n00:29:36.235 --> 00:29:42.880\nIt's an alias, in a where-object Itself.\n\n519\n00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:48.861\nSo those are all pretty decent things that\nyou should be a little bit familiar with.\n\n520\n00:29:48.861 --> 00:29:50.773\nBut, to tell you the truth,\nin some of the ones,\n\n521\n00:29:50.773 --> 00:29:54.086\neven though I can memorize all these and,\nat some point, when you start working with\n\n522\n00:29:54.086 --> 00:29:57.600\nit more, it's something you're going\nto end up doing, which is great.\n\n523\n00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.324\nBut, the only,\nI shouldn't say the only one,\n\n524\n00:30:00.324 --> 00:30:04.551\nthe one that I would be most concerned\nwith right away at the very beginning\n\n525\n00:30:04.551 --> 00:30:07.211\nis I'm gonna start noticing\nthat when I want to\n\n526\n00:30:07.211 --> 00:30:11.459\nconnect remotely to things it's gonna\nrequire me to authenticate a lot.\n\n527\n00:30:11.459 --> 00:30:16.940\nSo, what I can do, and I'm gonna use this\ndollar one instead to try to help us out.\n\n528\n00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:20.332\nIs I can go ahead and\n\n529\n00:30:20.332 --> 00:30:25.845\nset up let's say for example,\n\n530\n00:30:25.845 --> 00:30:32.639\na credential equals get credential.\n\n531\n00:30:32.639 --> 00:30:37.325\nWhen I do something like that\nit's going to ask me for\n\n532\n00:30:37.325 --> 00:30:43.719\nthose credentials initially and\nif I use joeyofficeprodemocode.com\n\n533\n00:30:43.719 --> 00:30:47.890\nmicrosoft .com if I can\nactually type it out.\n\n534\n00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.255\nSometimes my mouse gets stuck\nhere when I'm in the zoom.\n\n535\n00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:00.214\nThen I enter in the super secret password.\n\n536\n00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:08.792\nWhich I forgot [LAUGH] I did forget it,\nlet me see.\n\n537\n00:31:08.792 --> 00:31:10.453\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\n\n538\n00:31:10.453 --> 00:31:14.196\nwhen we take a look at PowerShell and it's\nalmost like, I don't know if you've ever\n\n539\n00:31:14.196 --> 00:31:17.254\nspent a little bit of time learning\na particular piece of software and\n\n540\n00:31:17.254 --> 00:31:19.190\nthen that software kinda vanishes.\n\n541\n00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:21.500\nAnd you kind of feel like,\nhey, I just lost all this or\n\n542\n00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.290\nI have all this unusable knowledge.\n\n543\n00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:28.320\nBut that's not necessarily the case\nwhenever we take a look at PowerShell\n\n544\n00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:32.350\nbecause if we look back to some of\nthose old school command line commands,\n\n545\n00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:36.063\nsome of those can be brought in use\ninto PowerShell as well, right?\n\n546\n00:31:36.063 --> 00:31:40.203\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they definitely are going to\nbe brought in in that way, to try and\n\n547\n00:31:40.203 --> 00:31:40.827\nhelp out.\n\n548\n00:31:40.827 --> 00:31:43.610\nSo the great thing is the more often\nyou use it the better it's gonna be.\n\n549\n00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:45.836\nLet me show you the result of\nwhat I just typed in here.\n\n550\n00:31:45.836 --> 00:31:47.390\nJust wanna make sure it got in.\n\n551\n00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:51.530\nNow even if I type in the wrong password,\nit would still take it.\n\n552\n00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:56.433\nBut every time you end up running\ninto a command that says, look.\n\n553\n00:31:56.433 --> 00:31:58.419\nYou need to offer credentials or\n\n554\n00:31:58.419 --> 00:32:03.199\nwhatever it might be Instead of me having\nto type out Joey's email address and\n\n555\n00:32:03.199 --> 00:32:07.608\nthen his password, all I have to do at\nthe end of that is actually type out\n\n556\n00:32:07.608 --> 00:32:14.275\nthe Credential along with that, and\nthat will substitute for the whole thing.\n\n557\n00:32:14.275 --> 00:32:19.048\nSo adding that in as a variable is\none of the key components that I've\n\n558\n00:32:19.048 --> 00:32:22.170\nused often and often, and so much so.\n\n559\n00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:26.658\nAnd just recently, we were doing\nan Office 365 show, where I was\n\n560\n00:32:26.658 --> 00:32:31.725\nconnecting in remotely to multiple\nservices, you know, out in the cloud.\n\n561\n00:32:31.725 --> 00:32:35.631\nI didn't have to retype in my\npassword a thousand times.\n\n562\n00:32:35.631 --> 00:32:37.838\nI simply created the credential one time,\nand\n\n563\n00:32:37.838 --> 00:32:40.470\nI was able to reuse that\nin multiple locations.\n\n564\n00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:44.216\nSo all these different\nsymbols are really great.\n\n565\n00:32:44.216 --> 00:32:47.100\nThat one though was probably\nby far the most helpful.\n\n566\n00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.784\nAnd not that you can't use the other ones,\nbut you'll use them in specific contexts,\n\n567\n00:32:50.784 --> 00:32:53.680\nwhereas that one you'll probably\nuse more often than you realize.\n\n568\n00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.360\nWell, Cherokee there is still a bit for\nus to cover but I think I ran out of time.\n\n569\n00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.223\n&gt;&gt; That's all right.\nI think we\n\n570\n00:32:59.223 --> 00:33:01.030\ngot a pretty good handle on things so far.\n\n571\n00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:05.321\nA good start with Powershell, but\nwe could go on for days with Powershell.\n\n572\n00:33:05.321 --> 00:33:08.699\nSo ladies and gentlemen, stay tune for\nmore Powershell headed your way.\n\n573\n00:33:08.699 --> 00:33:10.440\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n574\n00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.141\nRemember I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n575\n00:33:12.141 --> 00:33:13.067\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wang.\n\n576\n00:33:13.067 --> 00:33:14.966\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here ITProTV.\n\n577\n00:33:14.966 --> 00:33:22.079\n[MUSIC]\n\n578\n00:33:22.079 --> 00:33:25.148\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.380\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.032\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:14.980\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,\nto your Server 101 series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.130\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.850\nIn this episode, we'll continue\ntaking a look at PowerShell.\n\n8\n00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.630\nPreviously, Ronnie came in the studios and\nshowed us, really, how to get started,\n\n9\n00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.790\nshowing us that verb-noun syntax.\n\n10\n00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.370\nBut now we're kind of having\nthis conundrum about, well,\n\n11\n00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.960\nwhat do we do with PowerShell?\n\n12\n00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.740\nSo, back in the studios today, Mr.\n\n13\n00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.300\nRonnie Wong's gonna show us\nwhat we can actually perform.\n\n14\n00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.490\n&gt;&gt; That's true, in our previous episode,\nas we got started here with PowerShell.\n\n15\n00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.830\nWe were really just showing\nyou a couple of examples,\n\n16\n00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.030\nof what can be done just briefly.\n\n17\n00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.380\nJust examples of what PowerShell\nsyntactically does, right?\n\n18\n00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.160\nIn other words, the verb itself,\nand the verb noun agreement, and\n\n19\n00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.620\nwhat we can get out of it.\n\n20\n00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.550\nBut what are we gonna do?\n\n21\n00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.910\nRemember I told you that the focus of\nit was normally IT administration, so\n\n22\n00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.170\nthat's where we want to get to.\n\n23\n00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.130\nWe wanna get to that point where we're\nfocusing in on the IT administration.\n\n24\n00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.780\nThe skills that we're supposed\nto develop here is all\n\n25\n00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.780\nabout practicality on some of\nthe things that we need to do.\n\n26\n00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.140\nSo let's show you some of the first things\nthat need to happen when we start here.\n\n27\n00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.250\nSo on my screen, I went ahead and\nkind of loaded up a table and\n\n28\n00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.360\nyou'll find this inside of Brian\nSvidergol's book on Windows Server 101.\n\n29\n00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.820\nBut I just went ahead and just\nreproduced it here on the screen for us.\n\n30\n00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.430\nOne of the things that we have to do is we\nneed to setup what we call an execution\n\n31\n00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.090\npolicy as what needs to be done,\nwhen we're starting to take a look at it.\n\n32\n00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.210\nNow, you don't have to\nmemorize all of these,\n\n33\n00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.510\nbut there are times when you\nmight need to change them.\n\n34\n00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.340\nAnd so, when you start to take a look,\n\n35\n00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.020\nthere's a default policy that's\nnormally setup inside of server.\n\n36\n00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.700\nWhen you get to that,\nit's easy to find out.\n\n37\n00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.920\nSo let me log back into this machine, so\n\n38\n00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.640\nI can show you how easy it is to be\nable to find out what's running.\n\n39\n00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.230\nNow I'm connected over to dc01, which\nyou see right over here, which is fine.\n\n40\n00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:16.080\nAnd if I now type in,\nGet- ExecutionPolicy and I press Enter.\n\n41\n00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.270\nYou can now see where it says, hey this\none is RemoteSigned, is what we have.\n\n42\n00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.270\nNow, for most of us that\ndoesn't mean anything at all.\n\n43\n00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.600\nAnd you might even see that your's doesn't\nsay RemoteSigned as you type this in too.\n\n44\n00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.320\nSo you might see some other options.\n\n45\n00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.870\nThe other options that you'll\nsee are one of these particular\n\n46\n00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.490\nsix that we have available to us.\n\n47\n00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.290\nWe just want to make sure that you\nunderstood what would normally\n\n48\n00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.010\nhappen when you see these.\n\n49\n00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.460\nAnd why your PowerShell commands may be\nworking or may not be working here too.\n\n50\n00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.060\nSo when we start to take a look\nhere at the very top, Restricted.\n\n51\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.380\nAll of your configuration files and\nscripts, they won't load or\n\n52\n00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.210\nrun if everything is set to restricted.\n\n53\n00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.300\nIt's perfectly fine if somebody\ndoesn't want you doing anything and\n\n54\n00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.670\nyou don't have the permission to\nlaunch the administrative PowerShell.\n\n55\n00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.050\nYou probably are gonna be restricted then.\n\n56\n00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.680\nThe other option of course is All Signed.\n\n57\n00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.360\nNow this one says config files and\n\n58\n00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.810\nscripts must be digitally signed\nregardless of where they were created.\n\n59\n00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.230\nAnd this is a secured type of connection\n\n60\n00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.330\nthat we want to have on\nour machines as well.\n\n61\n00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.300\nRemember that scripts that come\nin from outside of your machine,\n\n62\n00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.360\noutside of your environment,\nyou don't know who may have written them.\n\n63\n00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.890\nSo instead what you want to do,\n\n64\n00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.890\nyou wanna make sure that there's\na digital signature attached.\n\n65\n00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.750\nEither those configuration files or\n\n66\n00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.500\nscripts, regardless of where they're\nactually created, make sure it's there.\n\n67\n00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.800\nIf they aren't signed they won't run.\n\n68\n00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.960\nThat's the way that you could see it.\n\n69\n00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.750\nRemoted Signed, this should say\nRemoteSigned is what it should say.\n\n70\n00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.000\nJust a typo on my end here\nis what we have as well.\n\n71\n00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.070\nThe idea of RemoteSigned\nhere config files and\n\n72\n00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.440\nand scripts from the Internet,\nmust be digitally signed, but\n\n73\n00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.850\nlocal scripts will normally run\nwithout real hesitation at all.\n\n74\n00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.110\nNow this is probably what will you'll see\nas a default just like what I showed you\n\n75\n00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.090\non the serve ready.\n\n76\n00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.980\nThere's not a lot that we tend to change,\nbut If there is one and\n\n77\n00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.410\nyou do need to change it,\nit's gonna be right here.\n\n78\n00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.313\nThe RemoteSigned,\n\n79\n00:04:28.313 --> 00:04:31.775\nthis is normally the default that's\ninstalled on Windows Server 2016.\n\n80\n00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:37.260\nI think even in 2012 R2 is actually\ngoing to be this RemoteSigned.\n\n81\n00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.100\nNormally that will allow us to run just\nabout anything that we locally create\n\n82\n00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.709\non our own.\n\n83\n00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:44.379\nWe don't have to worry about any\ntype of restriction on the execution\n\n84\n00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:45.600\nof these policies.\n\n85\n00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.930\nWe're fine.\n\n86\n00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.640\nThis one right here is normally\nsomething you do not want to run.\n\n87\n00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.600\nAnd I want to warn everybody about this,\nbefore you get into this habit of just\n\n88\n00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.360\nsaying, I don't care, I just want\nit to run, and you set it to this.\n\n89\n00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.820\nUnrestricted is exactly like it sounds.\n\n90\n00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.650\nIt will run without any signing, but\n\n91\n00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.960\nthe only kind of warning that you\nhave is if it's from the internet,\n\n92\n00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.530\nit's gonna tell you, this is from the\ninternet are you sure you want to run it?\n\n93\n00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.660\nWell, then you can do that.\n\n94\n00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.850\nIf you set up either one of these two,\nbypass will do the same thing and\n\n95\n00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.390\nwe'll look for the signature,\nbypass won't even warn anything okay?\n\n96\n00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.860\nSo config files and scripts will run\nwithout any restrictions at all,\n\n97\n00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.840\nnot exactly best practice at\nall to actually do any of this.\n\n98\n00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.980\nAnd the reason why I wanted to warn you\nabout this, especially from the Internet,\n\n99\n00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.090\nis this.\n\n100\n00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.980\nIf you see scripts out there from blogs\nand from different ones besides Microsoft,\n\n101\n00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.860\nand they tell you you should set\nyour execution policy to these two,\n\n102\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.220\nI wouldn't do it, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.310\nI'm not saying you can't, you obviously\ncan do it, but I just wouldn't do it.\n\n104\n00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.070\nYou know, if they need it,\nif you need it that open to run that,\n\n105\n00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.930\nthen more than likely it's not something\nthat you really want to necessarily do.\n\n106\n00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.000\nSo I would not do that\neven in a testing purpose.\n\n107\n00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.240\nTesting is probably the only place\nthat you might choose to do that, but\n\n108\n00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.840\nnever on a production environment.\n\n109\n00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.730\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, you would probably also\nwant to check with your organization to\n\n110\n00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.874\nsee if there are any kind of limitations.\n\n111\n00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:18.949\nLike regulatory compliancies that will\nprohibit or should be prohibiting you from\n\n112\n00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:24.565\nallowing these unrestricted or any kind of\nbypass or override type executables there.\n\n113\n00:06:24.565 --> 00:06:28.925\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just be careful when you\nrun that Get- ExecutionPolicy.\n\n114\n00:06:28.925 --> 00:06:34.075\nIf it's set to either one of these two,\nmake sure you know why it's set to that\n\n115\n00:06:34.075 --> 00:06:36.810\nbefore you choose to run\nsomething that as well.\n\n116\n00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.220\nAnd this last one is kind of unusual here,\nthis Undefined.\n\n117\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.960\nNo execution policy on the current\nsession, but a group policy object, a GPO,\n\n118\n00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.780\ncan set future execution policies.\n\n119\n00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.920\nSo let's say that you want to make sure\nthat this last script that you run\n\n120\n00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.350\nis not going to be limited by\nthat GPO that you're setting up.\n\n121\n00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.670\nBut notice,\nit says that a GPO that set up,\n\n122\n00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.300\ncan effect future\nexecution policies instead.\n\n123\n00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.060\nSo that way you can still have\nthat one and then everything after\n\n124\n00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.610\nthis you might go, all right, it's gonna\nbe controlled by this execution policy.\n\n125\n00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.530\nSo to be able to set something like that,\n\n126\n00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.320\nlet's go back over here to\nmy server when I do this.\n\n127\n00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.440\nWell, you wanna check first and\nforemost right here.\n\n128\n00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.510\nSo if you do the Get- ExecutionPolicy and\n\n129\n00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.530\nyou verify that it's RemoteSigned,\nyou really don't have to do anything else.\n\n130\n00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.490\nBut if somebody says look if you're gonna\nrun this make sure that you check your\n\n131\n00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.021\nexecution policy,\nmake sure you know what it is.\n\n132\n00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:41.071\nAnd if you need to set it,\nyou just do Set- ExecutionPolicy instead,\n\n133\n00:07:41.071 --> 00:07:44.930\nand then you can do the RemoteSigned.\n\n134\n00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.860\nSo that way it's not gonna hurt\nanything as I run it again.\n\n135\n00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.840\nBut that's how you can set that policy.\n\n136\n00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.230\nSo sometimes you may\nhave to set that policy.\n\n137\n00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.816\nNormally, I'd do it anyways, even though\nI know it's by default the way it's\n\n138\n00:07:56.816 --> 00:08:01.539\nalready set up with the Windows Server\nenvironment that I'm running But this is,\n\n139\n00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:02.991\nwhat is going to help us.\n\n140\n00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:05.224\nThe key here though,\nis to understand that for\n\n141\n00:08:05.224 --> 00:08:09.430\nyour organization two things are going\nto matter in the execution policy.\n\n142\n00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.910\nEither one of these is something\nthat we have to consider, right?\n\n143\n00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.830\nAnd both of them all together too,\nsecurity is the first one.\n\n144\n00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:20.550\nAnd then also administratively\nwhat hinders you in whether or\n\n145\n00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.440\nnot those scripts can be run with\nthe signatures or without them.\n\n146\n00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.600\nIf all of a sudden you go,\nI don't care, let me run everything,\n\n147\n00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:34.170\nthen you set it to that undefined or\nto that bypass, or what did I say here?\n\n148\n00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:38.100\nUnrestricted, sorry, not undefined,\nunrestricted and bypass.\n\n149\n00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.860\nThen you're gonna allow\npretty much anything to run.\n\n150\n00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:46.070\nAnd that's fine as long as you understand\nwhat the key is that you're going to do.\n\n151\n00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.950\nSo your organization though,\nthat's what you'll have to pick up.\n\n152\n00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.690\nAnd Cherokee makes a good point\nabout the security policies\n\n153\n00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.350\nthat are set up there before\nthese things are run.\n\n154\n00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.770\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\nonce we set our execution policy,\n\n155\n00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:01.590\nwhat are some common administrative\ntasks that we may encounter?\n\n156\n00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:06.370\nWell now that everything is done,\nusually for us one of the things that we\n\n157\n00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:10.090\nmay to do right away is to\ncheck things like hot fixes,\n\n158\n00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:14.810\nthat may actually be kind of key inside\nof the server environment, right?\n\n159\n00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.700\nWe want to make sure that our servers\nare up to date according to our security\n\n160\n00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.140\npractices and our update servers\nthe way that we want to.\n\n161\n00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.710\nBut it may be something that\nallows us to do that, so\n\n162\n00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:31.940\nnow I can do a get-hotfix,\nis what I want to be able to do.\n\n163\n00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.454\nAnd let's let it run and\nwe will see right here, there we go.\n\n164\n00:09:35.454 --> 00:09:38.980\nSo I'm running this on that remote\nmachine, once again that's why you're\n\n165\n00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.540\nseeing the source as being what you\nsee over here under the source.\n\n166\n00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.750\nNotice that all of these\nare updates in this subscription.\n\n167\n00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:50.310\nAnd here's the hotfix ID and\nI can even see the installation date\n\n168\n00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.490\nthat these have been run,\nwhen we start to see this.\n\n169\n00:09:53.490 --> 00:10:00.100\nNow, once I do that, I might be working\nand trying to figure out, like one.\n\n170\n00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:05.200\nNow, on a regular machine that's been up\nfor years let's say, for example, right?\n\n171\n00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.310\nIt's not gonna have four,\nwhich mine has been up for a month or\n\n172\n00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:14.430\na little bit longer than a month, not much\nlonger than a month here, that I've had.\n\n173\n00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:19.910\nWell, I might want to make this\na little bit more filtered,\n\n174\n00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.070\nis what the proper term is.\n\n175\n00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:25.470\nSo I'm gonna hit my up arrow that will\nallow me to bring that command back on\n\n176\n00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:31.030\nthe get-hotfix, then I'm going\nto pipe it into something else.\n\n177\n00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.600\nNow, when I talk about\nthe idea of piping here,\n\n178\n00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.020\nthat's when we have to kind\nof see a little bit more.\n\n179\n00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.250\nWe're taking this\nInformation right here and\n\n180\n00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.450\nwe're feeding it into the next\ncommand that we have.\n\n181\n00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:47.170\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie if we've never used\nthis particular command before.\n\n182\n00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.270\nWhen we're looking for\nthat some of you guys might, but\n\n183\n00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.770\nwhere do we find that on our keyboard?\n\n184\n00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:54.980\nBut if we look on the right side of our\nkeyboard under our backspace button,\n\n185\n00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.236\nthere you have it.\n\n186\n00:10:56.236 --> 00:10:58.090\nYou might not have ever\nhad to use it before, but\n\n187\n00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.600\nin PowerShell it can be very useful.\n\n188\n00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:08.050\n&gt;&gt; That is true, I always forget sometimes\nthat you may not actually have done that.\n\n189\n00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.410\nNow I'm going to use this\nInstalledOn date as well.\n\n190\n00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:16.020\nSo let's say that I pick this\nsecurity date update here.\n\n191\n00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.493\nInstalledOn, and\nthen I'm gonna use single quote marks if I\n\n192\n00:11:20.493 --> 00:11:24.449\ncan get to the single quote mark,\nit's right there.\n\n193\n00:11:24.449 --> 00:11:30.952\nAnd do 4/13/2017 and\n\n194\n00:11:30.952 --> 00:11:36.565\nthen 12 00.\n\n195\n00:11:36.565 --> 00:11:41.380\nSo hour, minute and seconds here,\nmake sure I got that.\n\n196\n00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.860\nAnd then this is gonna be in the AM,\nand close that off,\n\n197\n00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.170\nlet me see if you can see\nthat whole thing, all right.\n\n198\n00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.680\nSo now, I've closed it off, oops,\nI need an actual single quote,\n\n199\n00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.730\nnot the backtick here.\n\n200\n00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.100\nHere we go.\n&gt;&gt; So we're looking for\n\n201\n00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.120\nthat specific installation\nwith this particular query.\n\n202\n00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.650\n&gt;&gt; Right, so I'm just filtering this down\nand in a moment if everything, let's see.\n\n203\n00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:02.725\nSo somewhere along the line\nI have mistyped something.\n\n204\n00:12:02.725 --> 00:12:04.010\nis what ended up happening.\n\n205\n00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:09.460\nAnd that happens with me quite\noften if I don't do this correctly.\n\n206\n00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:13.760\nInstalledOn, let me make sure, I forgot.\n\n207\n00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:20.400\nThis actually needs to be an EQ for\nequals, that's what I forgot.\n\n208\n00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.270\nAnd now we'll see,\nin just a moment here, there we go.\n\n209\n00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:29.350\nSo this allows me to now filter this down.\n\n210\n00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.980\nSo remember, getting everything, it works.\n\n211\n00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.000\nBut then that still means that\nyou need to filter it out to\n\n212\n00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.420\nwhat you want it to be able to do.\n\n213\n00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.260\nThat's part of\nthe administration of things,\n\n214\n00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:43.080\nespecially if you need to verify whether\nor not you've got the proper hotfix or\n\n215\n00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.960\nnot, and you need to be able to do that.\n\n216\n00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.500\nSo you can use this to help\nsomething like that as well.\n\n217\n00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.412\nSo I chose this installation date,\nbut you could have gone back\n\n218\n00:12:53.412 --> 00:12:58.334\nif somebody said, hey,\ndid we get hotfix KB4015217?\n\n219\n00:12:58.334 --> 00:13:00.244\nAnd you're like,\nhow the heck would I know,\n\n220\n00:13:00.244 --> 00:13:02.770\nespecially if there's like\na string of 30 or 40 there.\n\n221\n00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.880\n&gt;&gt; Well, sure, sometimes you\nget notifications saying, hey,\n\n222\n00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.600\nthere's a particular vulnerability\nwith this particular hotfix or\n\n223\n00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.280\nthis patch that was issued out.\n\n224\n00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.370\nSo you wanna go back and check,\nor does this machine have it?\n\n225\n00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.440\nAn easy way to do that, right there.\n\n226\n00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is.\n\n227\n00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.170\nIt's all about filtering and making sure\nthat you get to that point that you need\n\n228\n00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.820\nto as well, and that way you can do that.\n\n229\n00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.490\nRemember that you can use all\nof these in different ways, too.\n\n230\n00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.950\nAnd so\ninstead of even just using InstalledOn,\n\n231\n00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.990\nwe could've said the description, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:36.720\nSecurity update, you could've included\na couple of different combinations.\n\n233\n00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.710\nWe're not so\nworried about that right now, but just so\n\n234\n00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.204\nthat you can see that, especially if\nyou need verify commands that come in.\n\n235\n00:13:42.204 --> 00:13:44.500\nHotfixes are kind of a big one,\n\n236\n00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.980\nespecially in today's world of security,\nthings that we have to worry about.\n\n237\n00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.070\nNow, I'm gonna move on from\nthis point here on this\n\n238\n00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.040\nverification of something like a hotfix.\n\n239\n00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.400\nTo also being able to show you\nthat with PowerShell itself,\n\n240\n00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.720\nwe can also do troubleshooting of\nsome network connectivity as well,\n\n241\n00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.200\nusing the PowerShell\ncommands to help us too.\n\n242\n00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.210\nSo let's take a look at that\naspect using the screen too.\n\n243\n00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:16.680\nSo once I actually in the PowerShell,\nI'm connected over to that DCO1.\n\n244\n00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.660\nLet's see,\nI can actually use the other one here.\n\n245\n00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.970\nLet me switch on over to this local\nmachine, and that way I can use the target\n\n246\n00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:30.820\nof DCO1 as kind of being what I\nwant to test against instead.\n\n247\n00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:36.615\nSo I can type in Test-NetConnection,\nand then the computer name.\n\n248\n00:14:39.384 --> 00:14:46.873\nAnd so let's say this would be O 365-DC01.\n\n249\n00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:54.190\nAnd press Enter, and now you'll see where\nit's actually testing that connection out.\n\n250\n00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.375\nNow let me zoom in so\nthat we can see this a little bit more.\n\n251\n00:14:56.375 --> 00:15:01.070\nTest-NetConnection, I set its limitation\nto a particular computer name.\n\n252\n00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.290\nAnd you can now see\nthe information that relays to me.\n\n253\n00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.680\nWhat I'm looking for\nis of course, whether or\n\n254\n00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.460\nnot the ping succeeded in\nterms of that connection.\n\n255\n00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.320\nNow, you might be going,\nwhy didn't I just run ping?\n\n256\n00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.930\nWell, you can definitely do that as well,\nbut\n\n257\n00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:20.520\nnotice the detail in the information\nthat we're also getting right here, too.\n\n258\n00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:25.700\nWe see that name resolution has occurred,\nwe also see the IP address.\n\n259\n00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:30.600\nI can see the interface in which\nmy machine received the ping,\n\n260\n00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.230\nas well as where the ping came from or\nwas issued from.\n\n261\n00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:35.480\nAnd then the ping success,\n\n262\n00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:40.350\nas well as then round trip time\nthat you also see here, too.\n\n263\n00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:45.120\nSo just getting some basic\nconnectivity might also help.\n\n264\n00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:50.190\nWhat if you're trying to make\nsure that a port is closed?\n\n265\n00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:53.785\nSo let's say that we get that requirement,\nCherokee, instead.\n\n266\n00:15:53.785 --> 00:15:55.796\nThat we want to make sure\nthat Telnet is closed.\n\n267\n00:15:55.796 --> 00:16:00.778\nNow that's kind of unusual in today's\nday and age that it would be open.\n\n268\n00:16:00.778 --> 00:16:08.080\nBut let's say we wanted to verify that our\ntelnet port was closed on a machine here.\n\n269\n00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.145\nWell, I can do the same thing.\n\n270\n00:16:10.145 --> 00:16:14.440\nTest-NetConnection here.\n\n271\n00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:20.724\nI wanna do the same\ncomputer name o365-dc01.\n\n272\n00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:27.160\nAnd once I do that, I can now type\nin port and then a particular port.\n\n273\n00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.340\nAnd that will run through and\nyou'll see it's actually waiting here.\n\n274\n00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.460\nThis may take a little bit of time.\n\n275\n00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:40.810\nBut notice it says it's attempting\nto do a TCP connect on port 23 okay?\n\n276\n00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:45.230\nSo I can test whether it;s closed and it\nshould show whether it's actually closed\n\n277\n00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:49.520\nor if it's open, that's something else\nthat I may want to be able to do and\n\n278\n00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.800\nthat's what we're hoping for right.\n\n279\n00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.075\nTCP connect to Office 365 or\n\n280\n00:16:55.075 --> 00:16:59.880\nO365 DCL1 on port 23 failed.\n\n281\n00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.300\nAnd that's something that might sound bad,\nbut in this instance,\n\n282\n00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.390\nespecially on Telnet, since this\nis unsecured protocol that we use,\n\n283\n00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:12.020\nthat we shouldn't use,\nit's actually a good thing\n\n284\n00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.950\nto be able to set something\nlike this up if we wanted to.\n\n285\n00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.120\nThe other ones that we can also do\n\n286\n00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:24.130\nas well is to verify that\nwell a port is actually on.\n\n287\n00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:30.750\nSo let's say for an example that I\nwanted to see if the remote desktop.\n\n288\n00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.890\nI couldn't remember what\nnumber I chose here,\n\n289\n00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.440\n3389 is the remote desktop connection.\n\n290\n00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.000\nIf I wanted to see if\nthat was actually on.\n\n291\n00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.920\nAnd open and ready to go.\n\n292\n00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.810\nIt's just changing the port\nnumber again to see.\n\n293\n00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:44.510\nSo this one,\n\n294\n00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:48.050\nI think I turned it on, I believe I\nturned it on, I don't know for sure.\n\n295\n00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:49.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat one should be off by default, and\n\n296\n00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:52.495\nyou would have to explicitly turn it on.\n\n297\n00:17:52.495 --> 00:17:55.735\nSo if you're going through,\nyou're just checking your systems and\n\n298\n00:17:55.735 --> 00:17:59.345\nyou know that you are not allowed to have\nany kind of remote desktop connections,\n\n299\n00:17:59.345 --> 00:18:02.275\nyou see this port open then you know\nthat there's an issue that you need\n\n300\n00:18:02.275 --> 00:18:05.345\nto go ahead and rectify in that situation.\n\n301\n00:18:05.345 --> 00:18:07.195\n&gt;&gt; And this one I turned on on purpose so\n\n302\n00:18:07.195 --> 00:18:09.700\nthat we could do this commands so\nwe could see the difference.\n\n303\n00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.280\nSo if you are actually looking for\n\n304\n00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.740\nthose ports that are open you can do\nthis one at a time as well and see,\n\n305\n00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:20.410\nespecially on those ports that somebody\nis specifically asking about as well.\n\n306\n00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.600\nAnd of course some of the other simple\nthings that we can do is we can\n\n307\n00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.200\nalso resolve a DNS name if you want to.\n\n308\n00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.686\nSo Resolve- DNSName, and\nlet's do the same thing.\n\n309\n00:18:32.686 --> 00:18:38.610\nName o365-dc01.\n\n310\n00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.590\nPress enter.\n\n311\n00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:43.470\nAnd notice, it returns to me the A record,\nthat we see right here, and\n\n312\n00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.330\navailable to us, with the IPAddress.\n\n313\n00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.630\nNow, if it doesn't return that,\nif you don't get the information\n\n314\n00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.450\nthat you're looking for, the great thing\nis, it kind of shows you something.\n\n315\n00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.940\nThere might be something wrong with DNS\nitself, or you just mistyped the command.\n\n316\n00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.420\nIf you didn't mistype the command,\nit should show up like this.\n\n317\n00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.340\nIf you mistype it, well then you know,\n\n318\n00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.050\nbecause it's going to spew\nlet's say red all over you.\n\n319\n00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:08.790\nSo for example, one of the things that I\ndid when I was trying to test this out,\n\n320\n00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.940\nand I just didn't realize\nthat my handwriting, or\n\n321\n00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.610\nthat my typing skills had gotten so bad.\n\n322\n00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:18.310\nI typed in this, which to me looks\nthe same, except for, Cherokee,\n\n323\n00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:21.830\nif you take a look,\nthat's a zero instead, right?\n\n324\n00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:25.590\nSo yeah, and I kept looking at it,\nso I pressed Enter.\n\n325\n00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:29.460\nAnd I was like what is going on here,\nwhy isn't that actually going to work?\n\n326\n00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.370\nWell, that doesn't necessarily\nmean that DMS is wrong, but\n\n327\n00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.390\nit means that I typed it in wrong.\n\n328\n00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:37.520\nThat's when it says,\nDMS name does not exist.\n\n329\n00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.338\nWell, it means that I have\nto check that out and\n\n330\n00:19:39.338 --> 00:19:42.650\nrealize that there's some other\nthings that are happening too.\n\n331\n00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:46.357\nSo just two examples of some\nadministrative tasks that we have\n\n332\n00:19:46.357 --> 00:19:47.540\navailable.\n\n333\n00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:51.170\nThat we can also use PowerShell 4 as well.\n\n334\n00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:52.440\nNow other things of course,\n\n335\n00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.240\nare about administrative efficiencies\non things that we end up doing.\n\n336\n00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.940\nSo let's show you another helpful command\nthat will also help you out here.\n\n337\n00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.710\nSo let me do this, get dash, History here.\n\n338\n00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.668\nLet me clear this off, so\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n339\n00:20:06.668 --> 00:20:10.134\nGet-history.\n\n340\n00:20:10.134 --> 00:20:14.520\nAnd now check this out right here, okay?\n\n341\n00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.550\nSo these are all the commands that\nI've just used in this show so far.\n\n342\n00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.960\nFrom the session that I'm in right now\n\n343\n00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:25.610\nyou can see that here is the commands that\nI've used right here in this one session\n\n344\n00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:28.360\nwhere I type in all\nthese different things.\n\n345\n00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:33.070\nIf I want to run them again it's\nactually fairly easy to do so.\n\n346\n00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:37.700\nSo if you've ever had where there's like\n40 or 50 commands that you've run instead\n\n347\n00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.680\nwell let's say that you\ndon't remember the syntax,\n\n348\n00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.330\nespecially if it's really, really long.\n\n349\n00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.670\nYou know I just need to\ninvoke that command again.\n\n350\n00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:49.515\nWell here you just type in invoke-history.\n\n351\n00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.890\nAnd then you tell it the actual\nnumber that you want.\n\n352\n00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.559\nSo let's take, for\nan example, number 10 here.\n\n353\n00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:00.740\nAnd there it goes.\n\n354\n00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.720\nI don't have to re-type\nin that whole command,\n\n355\n00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.562\nespecially if I've strung a lot of these\non, and different measures as well.\n\n356\n00:21:07.562 --> 00:21:08.920\nAll right.\n\n357\n00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.130\nThe other thing of course is getting\na little bit more information.\n\n358\n00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:17.010\nSo let's do that get dash service command\nthat we've been taking a look at.\n\n359\n00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:19.850\nCherokee I want to be\nable to find out well,\n\n360\n00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:23.660\nthe number of services\nthat maybe running too.\n\n361\n00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:31.563\nSo instead of just getting everything\nwhich is a lot I can now do a Pipe again,\n\n362\n00:21:31.563 --> 00:21:36.470\nmeasured object.\n\n363\n00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:37.530\nOops, let me see.\n\n364\n00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.570\nWhat did I do wrong here?\n\n365\n00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:40.242\nGet dash service.\n\n366\n00:21:45.625 --> 00:21:46.900\nDid I misspell something?\n\n367\n00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:48.600\nMeasured.\n\n368\n00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:51.850\nMeasure object not measured.\n\n369\n00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:53.740\nI was like, what is that.\n\n370\n00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.289\nSee?\nSee, once again misspelling on\n\n371\n00:21:55.289 --> 00:21:56.410\nmine end here.\n\n372\n00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:57.170\nMeasured.\n\n373\n00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:58.970\nI was like I know that that's correct.\n\n374\n00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:00.999\n&gt;&gt; You know what, I'm gonna do\nthe same thing Ryan, just wait.\n\n375\n00:22:00.999 --> 00:22:02.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can't say anything.\n\n376\n00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.080\nI can't pick on you because\nI'm gonna do it, too.\n\n377\n00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:04.605\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n378\n00:22:04.605 --> 00:22:05.200\n&gt;&gt; So there it is.\n\n379\n00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.010\nSo here's the count of the actual\nservices that we're seeing.\n\n380\n00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.940\nYou can see that you can\nactually do other things,\n\n381\n00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:15.220\nlike instead, look some maximum and\nminimum properties here.\n\n382\n00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.960\nSo if you needed to,\nyou could return a number of objects.\n\n383\n00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.880\nNow, I'm just doing services,\nbut you could do this with\n\n384\n00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.700\nthe users that we're looking at,\nlike the Get-ADUsers and stuff.\n\n385\n00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.630\nYou can do this with a lot if\nyou actually put your mind\n\n386\n00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.480\nto seeing some of the different things\nthat you have available as well.\n\n387\n00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.710\nNow, I've used a pipeline\nthroughout this show,\n\n388\n00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:40.070\nand really never mentioned what the idea\nof the pipeline really helps us to do.\n\n389\n00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:44.750\nWhen we start to need to do something\nlike what we're doing here, get -service,\n\n390\n00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.180\nlike we showed you, shows a lot.\n\n391\n00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:52.090\nWe can also use another command to\nhelp us to do some other things.\n\n392\n00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:56.090\nSo instead,\nin this particular example that we have,\n\n393\n00:22:56.090 --> 00:23:00.000\nright, get-service gives us\neverything that I want and\n\n394\n00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.600\nthen I'm gonna pipe that into, well go\nahead and count those objects out for me.\n\n395\n00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.300\nAnd let's go ahead and do that as well.\n\n396\n00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.300\nSo it allows us to connect\nmultiple commands together,\n\n397\n00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.960\nto produce really a single result\nis what we have the ability to do.\n\n398\n00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:21.180\nSo if I run a get-process,\nlet's take that, for example.\n\n399\n00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.110\nWow, look there's a ton\nof different processes\n\n400\n00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:25.798\nthat are actually available to me.\n\n401\n00:23:25.798 --> 00:23:31.950\nAnd I wanna find out lets say on\nthis CPU side that I want to sort\n\n402\n00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:37.001\nby the CPU,\nI can do that get dash process and now,\n\n403\n00:23:37.001 --> 00:23:41.566\nI can pipe that into\nsomething else as well.\n\n404\n00:23:41.566 --> 00:23:46.390\nSo lets see, sort.\n\n405\n00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:50.134\nObject CPU.\n\n406\n00:23:50.134 --> 00:23:53.914\nAnd now we can see where\nI've sorted that object, and\n\n407\n00:23:53.914 --> 00:23:58.450\nyou can actually see where it's\nactually building up, right,\n\n408\n00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:03.742\nbecause I didn't actually put descending\nIn ascending, you can see where\n\n409\n00:24:03.742 --> 00:24:09.056\nit's counting up the actual CPU\nutilization all the way to that end there.\n\n410\n00:24:09.056 --> 00:24:12.135\nAnd then if I choose,\nis it gonna be descending?\n\n411\n00:24:12.135 --> 00:24:15.472\nAnd now you can see where it\nactually lists it backward,\n\n412\n00:24:15.472 --> 00:24:17.790\nor descending order instead.\n\n413\n00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:21.830\nRight at the top here,\nyou see this MsMpEng.\n\n414\n00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.205\nRight here where it actually shows you,\n\n415\n00:24:24.205 --> 00:24:30.240\n46.5% of the CPU is being\neaten up by that as well.\n\n416\n00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.050\nAll right, so\n\n417\n00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:36.720\nthere's a couple of different ones that\nreally do help us in the idea of piping.\n\n418\n00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.075\nIt's two commands where we're normally\nputting one, the result of one.\n\n419\n00:24:40.075 --> 00:24:44.090\nAnd feeding that into the command of the\nother, to produce the result that we want.\n\n420\n00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:48.408\nOne other thing that I also want to\nbe able to do, is talk about the idea\n\n421\n00:24:48.408 --> 00:24:53.690\nof installing just a simple Windows\nfeature that we might have available.\n\n422\n00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:59.800\nIf I do a get -windowsFeatures here.\n\n423\n00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.110\nThat's going to give me\na ton of different features\n\n424\n00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.970\nthat are absolutely available to me.\n\n425\n00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:08.220\nAnd I keep scrolling up.\n\n426\n00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:13.130\nLet me see, there's a Display Name,\nhere's a Name, here's an Install State.\n\n427\n00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:18.619\nBut if I scroll all the way down to\nthe bottom, I'm just picking one, almost.\n\n428\n00:25:18.619 --> 00:25:24.050\nAnd so let's just say something like here,\non SMTP server and services, etc.\n\n429\n00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:28.220\nNow that's not all that's\nactually available, sometimes.\n\n430\n00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.910\nWhat we can do is, we can again use\nthe pipe command to help us out.\n\n431\n00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:36.498\nSo if I do a get -windowsFeatures,\n\n432\n00:25:38.839 --> 00:25:44.110\nI'm now hitting my, Tab,\nto help us out here.\n\n433\n00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:52.741\nI want to limit this down,\nby the name, to anything\n\n434\n00:25:52.741 --> 00:25:56.710\nthat has SMTP in it.\n\n435\n00:25:59.386 --> 00:26:03.002\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we're specifically\nlooking for simple mail transfer\n\n436\n00:26:03.002 --> 00:26:07.010\nprotocol-associated features,\nthat's what we're really doing here.\n\n437\n00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:10.270\n&gt;&gt; Right, so whether it begins with\nsomething else and has SMTP in it, or\n\n438\n00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:13.600\nwhether ends with it, or whatever it is,\nSMTP should be in the name.\n\n439\n00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.050\nNow I can see where I can do this.\n\n440\n00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:22.438\nWhere SMTP Server Tools,\nas well as the SMTP Server,\n\n441\n00:26:22.438 --> 00:26:27.050\nfairly simple to be able\nto get once we get that.\n\n442\n00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:33.540\nNow if I wanted to, now that I have\nthat one feature, I can take this.\n\n443\n00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:39.932\nLet's just do the RSAT-SMTP,\n\n444\n00:26:39.932 --> 00:26:45.057\nthen I can pipe that directly into\n\n445\n00:26:45.057 --> 00:26:50.191\nthe Install-WindowsFeature.\n\n446\n00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:54.210\nAnd when I do this, it allows me\nto do this all in one command.\n\n447\n00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.110\nInstead of me having to go through and\ngo, all right,\n\n448\n00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:58.200\nnow I know what the name\nof the feature is.\n\n449\n00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.380\nAs long as I can figure this out,\nnotice it's really one command.\n\n450\n00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:05.425\nI've took the result of saying,\nI know what the name is,\n\n451\n00:27:05.425 --> 00:27:09.250\nI want to get that feature, and\nnow I want to install that feature.\n\n452\n00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.700\nAnd that's what we're seeing\nis happening right here.\n\n453\n00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:16.080\nSo it really is kind of very easy for\nus, as we start working it,\n\n454\n00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.240\nto pipe more and more commands together.\n\n455\n00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.920\nAs much as single commands,\nwhere we like to stay,\n\n456\n00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.360\nbecause we think of them as being simple.\n\n457\n00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:23.970\n&gt;&gt; Safe zones.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n458\n00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:25.920\nsafe zone, it's not gonna be that way.\n\n459\n00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.690\nYou're gonna see the more\npower to PowerShell,\n\n460\n00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:32.510\nwhen you start doing more piping, and\nmore of the information in there.\n\n461\n00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:38.040\nAnd then you should see at the end,\nno restart needed, the success was true.\n\n462\n00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.322\nExit code Success, and\nyou are now ready to go.\n\n463\n00:27:41.322 --> 00:27:46.170\nSo there's a lot that is available to you,\nto get started.\n\n464\n00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.330\nAnd don't forget,\nwe've mentioned it before,\n\n465\n00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:51.820\nthat you can also use the idea\nof the help command as well.\n\n466\n00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.440\nBut if I wanted to get help for\na particular command, let's say for\n\n467\n00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:01.711\nanything that has eventlog in\nit I can simply just type in,\n\n468\n00:28:01.711 --> 00:28:06.128\njust by using some of the syntax that\nwe've been learning here, right.\n\n469\n00:28:06.128 --> 00:28:11.330\nThe wildcard at the beginning, and\nthen of course, the wildcard at the end.\n\n470\n00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:17.730\nI can actually see the specific commands\nthat are associated with this, too.\n\n471\n00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:25.020\nThe other ones, such as get-module,\nthat I might want to do.\n\n472\n00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.072\nI might want to see what's\nactually available to me.\n\n473\n00:28:29.571 --> 00:28:31.067\nSo we can do a get-module,\n\n474\n00:28:31.067 --> 00:28:34.980\nand then list what's actually available\nin terms of the modules here.\n\n475\n00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:41.590\nAnd then you can see, wow, there's quite\na few modules that are actually out there,\n\n476\n00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:42.890\nand ready for us too.\n\n477\n00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:48.604\nSo there are many different ways that,\nif we're not exactly sure what to do.\n\n478\n00:28:48.604 --> 00:28:52.006\nWhere PowerShell itself has not only\nthe help features that are there.\n\n479\n00:28:52.006 --> 00:28:55.295\nBut just learning and\nusing that tab completion helps you,\n\n480\n00:28:55.295 --> 00:28:58.800\nin the spelling mistakes\nthat I traditionally make.\n\n481\n00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.500\nIt helps you in a lot of\ndifferent ways as well.\n\n482\n00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.420\nBut it's a utility that you're not\ngoing to be able to run away from.\n\n483\n00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:06.566\nThere is coming that point,\n\n484\n00:29:06.566 --> 00:29:09.499\nwhere I think what you're going to\nend up seeing is that, more and more.\n\n485\n00:29:09.499 --> 00:29:13.458\nThey even recommend this in\nthe Windows Server 2016, right,\n\n486\n00:29:13.458 --> 00:29:16.460\nthat the default installation is what?\n\n487\n00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:20.358\nIt really is just a command prompt,\nit kind of brings you out there.\n\n488\n00:29:20.358 --> 00:29:21.530\nOr it's saying if you don't need it-\n&gt;&gt; Well that's saying a lot.\n\n489\n00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:23.817\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you don't need it,\nthen do this.\n\n490\n00:29:23.817 --> 00:29:27.190\nAnd so they're gonna expect you\nto work more and more with it.\n\n491\n00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:30.064\nSo don't avoid it,\njump in a little bit into the shallow end,\n\n492\n00:29:30.064 --> 00:29:31.902\nlike what we've just showed you here.\n\n493\n00:29:31.902 --> 00:29:35.045\nAnd that will go a long way,\nas you keep learning more, but\n\n494\n00:29:35.045 --> 00:29:36.851\nthere is no avoiding it anymore.\n\n495\n00:29:36.851 --> 00:29:39.158\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There used to be that point where you\n\n496\n00:29:39.158 --> 00:29:43.943\ncould, just go, that's for another day,\nyou're passed that other day part now.\n\n497\n00:29:43.943 --> 00:29:48.059\nAnd it means you've just gotta\nkind of put your head down and go,\n\n498\n00:29:48.059 --> 00:29:50.510\nlet me learn at least the basics here.\n\n499\n00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:51.180\n&gt;&gt; So true, Ronnie.\n\n500\n00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:55.330\nI mean, this was a PowerShell show,\nthe last couple episodes were.\n\n501\n00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.360\nBut moving forward, even in the next\nshow and throughout this series,\n\n502\n00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.660\nwe're gonna be using it quite a bit.\n\n503\n00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:03.700\nSo we'll also try to incorporate\nour PowerShell commands,\n\n504\n00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:07.300\nas well as showing you how to\ndo things through the GUI.\n\n505\n00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.140\nBut like Ronnie said,\n\n506\n00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:12.050\nyou really do need to go ahead and\nbite that proverbial bullet here.\n\n507\n00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:15.480\nBut for this show, we are out of time,\nso we're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n508\n00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.390\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n509\n00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:18.140\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

They discuss what a server role is and what must be done to install the role  using the GUI and PowerShell.  Cherokee demonstrates the installation of 2 separate roles and then how to uninstall an installed role.  They emphasize the best practice of only installing the services and features needed and not haphazardly installing every role and feature available.",

00:00:12.261\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.261 --> 00:00:15.577\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.577 --> 00:00:18.516\nYou're watching\nthe Windows Server 101 show.\n\n6\n00:00:18.516 --> 00:00:20.161\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n7\n00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:24.220\ntoday we're gonna be diving into taking\na look at adding roles and features.\n\n8\n00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.480\nAnd here to help us with that\nis gonna be Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.070\nCherokee, welcome back to the studios.\n\n10\n00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.380\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Ronnie, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.290\n&gt;&gt; It's going well.\n\n12\n00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.980\nNow, before we dive directly into\nwhat we're going to be doing,\n\n13\n00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.850\nthere may be people out there that\nhave not taken the time to actually\n\n14\n00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.580\nfigure out what a role or feature is.\n\n15\n00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.370\nSo let's start with that, Cherokee.\n\n16\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.970\nWhat do we talk about when\nwe talk about roles or\n\n17\n00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.600\nfeatures inside of Windows Server?\n\n18\n00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.200\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if we take a look at\nthe operating system as a whole, and\n\n19\n00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.810\nwe've already mentioned this idea,\nthis notion of hardening our servers.\n\n20\n00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.860\nWe're kind of restricting them, we don't\nwanna have any kind of frivolous or\n\n21\n00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.060\nunnecessary coding running on them.\n\n22\n00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.200\nWe wanna keep it as slim as possible.\n\n23\n00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.300\nSo Microsoft is in line with this concept,\nthis theory, and they say, look,\n\n24\n00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.450\nwe're going to provide you\nthe capability of customizing and\n\n25\n00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.600\npicking and choosing what components you\nwanna run on this particular server.\n\n26\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.860\nWe're not just gonna give you\neverything out of the box.\n\n27\n00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.100\nSo by taking a look at different roles,\nroles are going to be\n\n28\n00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.490\nlike different functionalities\nthat Microsoft is providing us.\n\n29\n00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.860\nSo different servers, well,\nif you think about the term, servers,\n\n30\n00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.690\nservers offer some kind of service to\nyour network, to your environment.\n\n31\n00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.920\nAnd we typically see roles\nsupporting a service like DHCP, DNS.\n\n32\n00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.630\nPerhaps, we're running\nas a domain controller.\n\n33\n00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.990\nAnd we have the ability to add multiple\nroles to one particular machine.\n\n34\n00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.110\nBut we also have the ability to\njust create an individual machine,\n\n35\n00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.700\nwhether it be physical or virtual, and\nkinda dub it as a dedicated server.\n\n36\n00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.760\nAnd what that means is that's the sole\nfunction of that particular machine,\n\n37\n00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.513\nthat server.\n\n38\n00:02:06.513 --> 00:02:10.182\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, Cherokee, when you\nstart talking about that idea of a role,\n\n39\n00:02:10.182 --> 00:02:12.102\nwhat we're saying is we're looking for\n\n40\n00:02:12.102 --> 00:02:15.394\nthat specific functionality we want\nto add into the Windows Server.\n\n41\n00:02:15.394 --> 00:02:20.033\nSo we'll do what we want it to do, but\nthen we also have to decide, as we start\n\n42\n00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:24.889\nadding on roles, whether or not this is\ngoing to be what we call a multipurpose or\n\n43\n00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:30.350\na multi-function server, or whether it's\ngonna be a dedicated server as well.\n\n44\n00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.934\nSo when we pick and choose that way,\nwhat are we normally looking for\n\n45\n00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:39.410\nif I want it to actually be a dedicated\nserver versus a multipurpose server?\n\n46\n00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.036\n&gt;&gt; Well, you really should\nlook at the pre-planning and\n\n47\n00:02:42.036 --> 00:02:45.990\nthe design of your network if you're gonna\nbe offering any kind of redundancies.\n\n48\n00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.430\nAnd it really boils down\nto budget a lot of times.\n\n49\n00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.470\nIf I can afford additional machines,\nif I can afford additional hardware to run\n\n50\n00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.480\nextra virtual machines to segregate and\nbreak them up.\n\n51\n00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.608\nSometimes, we're not always\nprovided with that luxury and\n\n52\n00:02:58.608 --> 00:03:01.443\nwe kinda have to make things work for\nour environment.\n\n53\n00:03:01.443 --> 00:03:05.181\nBut if at all possible, it's best to\nkinda divide and have multiple DNS\n\n54\n00:03:05.181 --> 00:03:09.120\nservers within your environment, so\nthat you don't have that downtime.\n\n55\n00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.399\nBecause when we look at the expectations,\nand we talk about our 5 9's,\n\n56\n00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:20.292\nat 99.999% of availability when we\ntalk about high availability, even.\n\n57\n00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:23.482\nThat equates to five minutes,\nfive seconds of annual downtime,\n\n58\n00:03:23.482 --> 00:03:25.520\nwhich doesn't give us much wiggle room.\n\n59\n00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.610\nSo that's going to be a big\nconsideration as well.\n\n60\n00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.560\nYou also wanna think\nabout the type of roles.\n\n61\n00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.460\nYou don't really wanna back yourself\nup into any kind of corner there and\n\n62\n00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.380\nshoot yourself in the foot because\none particular machine goes down, and\n\n63\n00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.920\nthen your network is at a standstill.\n\n64\n00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.870\nSo you wanna keep that continuity,\nkeep that company rolling, productive.\n\n65\n00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.940\nMost of the roles are going to\nbe independent of each other and\n\n66\n00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.260\nnot have any kind of dependencies.\n\n67\n00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.580\nHowever, you will see,\nit's important to understand and\n\n68\n00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.270\ngo through each one of the roles.\n\n69\n00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.461\nAnd really just research before you\ndecide to deploy a particular server with\n\n70\n00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:06.626\na specific purpose.\n\n71\n00:04:06.626 --> 00:04:11.303\nBecause sometimes you'll see that a role\nrequires any kind of sub-roles or\n\n72\n00:04:11.303 --> 00:04:13.421\nmaybe even features to go ahead and\n\n73\n00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:17.410\nenhance its full functionality\nof that particular role.\n\n74\n00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.840\nSo Active Directory Domain Services\n\n75\n00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.030\nrequires the use of DNS\nto be installed as well.\n\n76\n00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.550\nSo it's integrating DNS with that\nActive Directory server there.\n\n77\n00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.690\nAnd if you take a look at DHCP,\n\n78\n00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.200\nwe have management tools that can\nbe added with that particular role.\n\n79\n00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.259\nSo we'll take a look at this in a few\nmoments because it's not a necessity for\n\n80\n00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.489\nthose management tools to be installed.\n\n81\n00:04:44.489 --> 00:04:48.834\nBut if you plan on managing the DHCP\nrole locally on that machine,\n\n82\n00:04:48.834 --> 00:04:50.970\nthen you'll need those tools.\n\n83\n00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.010\nHowever, if you're gonna be managing it\nremotely, then you would go ahead and\n\n84\n00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.760\ninstall those management\ntools on that remote system.\n\n85\n00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.940\nSo it really just comes down and\nboils down to planning and\n\n86\n00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.806\nthinking about it ahead of time.\n\n87\n00:05:02.806 --> 00:05:06.391\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, Cherokee, what are we\ngonna take a look at first as we really\n\n88\n00:05:06.391 --> 00:05:10.168\nneed to get some practical knowledge down\non adding in those servers and roles?\n\n89\n00:05:10.168 --> 00:05:13.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, Ronnie, you showed us\nwhat we could do within PowerShell and\n\n90\n00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.580\nthat's really cool because we now have\nthat ability not to just use the GUI, but\n\n91\n00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.000\nI think that's a good place to start.\n\n92\n00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.160\nWe'll look at both.\n\n93\n00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.650\nSo for the first role we'll install, let's\ngo ahead and take a look at my machine and\n\n94\n00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.000\nwe'll be installing DHCP\nlike we had just mentioned.\n\n95\n00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.030\nThe interface is pretty\nuser-friendly here.\n\n96\n00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.410\nI think they've done a great job.\n\n97\n00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.380\nI mean, you look here at number two, this\nbutton, it says, Add roles and features.\n\n98\n00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.030\nWe go ahead and click this button and\nit'll automatically launch a wizard.\n\n99\n00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:45.050\nSo this first page is like\nan introduction page, it's not required.\n\n100\n00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.010\nAs a matter of fact, they give you\nthe option to skip this page by default if\n\n101\n00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:55.340\nyou're gonna be installing quite often,\nbut that's just up to you.\n\n102\n00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.370\nNow, we didn't add additional,\nokay, I'll get to that in a second.\n\n103\n00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.860\nWe'll get to that,\nI'm just installing DHCP on one server.\n\n104\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.791\nBut I do have the ability to\nadd servers like we looked at\n\n105\n00:06:06.791 --> 00:06:10.997\nin the previous episodes, where we could\nadd them to different server pools or\n\n106\n00:06:10.997 --> 00:06:14.335\ngroups so I could deploy it\nsimultaneously to help save time.\n\n107\n00:06:14.335 --> 00:06:18.852\nBut on this page, we're asked what\nare we gonna be installing here.\n\n108\n00:06:18.852 --> 00:06:22.460\nA role-based or\nfeature based installation, so typically,\n\n109\n00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.810\nthat's what you'll be installing.\n\n110\n00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.920\nHowever, you do have\nan alternative option down here to\n\n111\n00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.291\nutilize Remote Desktop Services,\nwhich if you're utilizing VDI,\n\n112\n00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:33.180\nVirtual Desktop Infrastructure,\n\n113\n00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.630\nthat's the option you would choose,\nthis radio button down here.\n\n114\n00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.110\nBut for now, let's go ahead and\n\n115\n00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.450\nkeep it role-based because DHCP role\nis what we're gonna be looking at here.\n\n116\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.980\nAnd this is what I was mentioning there.\n\n117\n00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.420\nWhen we get to this screen, we have\nthe ability to add additional servers\n\n118\n00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.460\nto this pool here so that we can\nsimultaneously deploy this role.\n\n119\n00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.382\nBut we're just gonna go ahead and\nkeep it on this local,\n\n120\n00:07:01.382 --> 00:07:05.382\nit's PLabdmo1 for now and we'll hit Next.\n\n121\n00:07:05.382 --> 00:07:07.600\nNow, this is gonna be a list of the roles.\n\n122\n00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:14.760\nAnd if you think of the different\nversions of Microsoft Windows Server,\n\n123\n00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.450\nyou see the roles\nexpanding over the years.\n\n124\n00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.210\nSo it's kind of cool if you\nwanna just really go through and\n\n125\n00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.103\ncheck these out, you get nice\nlittle descriptions over here.\n\n126\n00:07:24.103 --> 00:07:27.300\nWait, over there,\n[LAUGH] in the panel there.\n\n127\n00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.900\nSo you can check those out.\n\n128\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.840\nNow, when you take a look and you can\nexpand out these little arrows because\n\n129\n00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:40.010\nsometimes you'll have those supporting\nservices that are required.\n\n130\n00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.570\nYou don't have to install all of them.\n\n131\n00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:46.080\nIf I zoom in here, you can see\nthat some of them are grayed out,\n\n132\n00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.190\nsome of them have the check-boxes.\n\n133\n00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.320\nIt really just depends on what you need,\nand\n\n134\n00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.890\nso a little bit of research\nwill really take you far.\n\n135\n00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.726\nAnd also, take advantage of those\ndescriptions that Microsoft does provide\n\n136\n00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:58.328\non the right-hand side there.\n\n137\n00:07:58.328 --> 00:08:00.512\nSo you can go down and\ncheck out your roles, but\n\n138\n00:08:00.512 --> 00:08:02.811\nwe're just gonna be\nfocusing on DHCP right now.\n\n139\n00:08:02.811 --> 00:08:07.641\nSo, I just clicked inside of that box, and\nall the sudden you see this new window pop\n\n140\n00:08:07.641 --> 00:08:11.500\nup, and it's kind of like\na wizard inside of a wizard here.\n\n141\n00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.540\nAnd this is going to be that option that\nI was telling you about where we could go\n\n142\n00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.180\nahead and install those management tools.\n\n143\n00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.380\nAnd you see down here this little arrow,\n\n144\n00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.130\nthis check box, I have the ability\nto uncheck that, if I had\n\n145\n00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:28.410\nplanned on managing this server remotely,\nbut we'll just them on here for now.\n\n146\n00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:32.680\nHit Add Features, now\n\n147\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.740\nwe'll hit Next after we install those,\nnow this page is going to be features.\n\n148\n00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.460\nSo features you might wanna think of them,\nI know this is kind of silly Ronnie but\n\n149\n00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.930\nI almost think of them as like cheer\nleaders supporting that main role.\n\n150\n00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.640\nLike yeah you can do it, because sometimes\nyou are required to go ahead and\n\n151\n00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.300\nhave some additional features.\n\n152\n00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.788\nNow, this is kind of interesting, if we\nlook at these first couple of features,\n\n153\n00:08:53.788 --> 00:08:58.240\nthe .NET Framework 3.5 and\nthe .NET Framework 4., this one's 4.6.\n\n154\n00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.520\nWhen you get into those frameworks,\nthose are gonna be ones that you have\n\n155\n00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.000\nto kind of be aware of, because you'll\nneed either the installation media or\n\n156\n00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.390\nyou'll need an Internet connection\nto go and pull those down.\n\n157\n00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.550\nBecause if you think about the way\nthat our source files are stored,\n\n158\n00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:22.520\nour source files are actually stored\nin something called SXS file,\n\n159\n00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.782\nside by side file, and\nit's not a huge file.\n\n160\n00:09:26.782 --> 00:09:31.670\nI wanna say it's about four gigs, but if\nwe're working with one individual machine\n\n161\n00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.755\nthat's where we're pulling these roles and\nfeatures from, right.\n\n162\n00:09:37.315 --> 00:09:40.145\nWe have to have connectivity to\nget these other two, but for\n\n163\n00:09:40.145 --> 00:09:44.845\nthe most part the others you should\nbe able to pull from that SXS file.\n\n164\n00:09:44.845 --> 00:09:50.585\nHowever, if I am,\nlet's say I have a cluster of machines and\n\n165\n00:09:50.585 --> 00:09:56.190\nI don't wanna have multiple SXS files for\n\n166\n00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:00.830\nreally no purpose, and I just can utilize\nlike the concept of data duplication,\n\n167\n00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.080\nwhere I'm examining,\nreconciling this information.\n\n168\n00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.070\nOr I'm just gonna say hey,\nyou know what, let's go ahead and\n\n169\n00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:12.040\nput this SXS file centrally,\nlike in a central repository.\n\n170\n00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.390\nI have the ability to point back to\nthat repository and only store it once,\n\n171\n00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.610\nto save storage.\n\n172\n00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.810\nNot a huge deal these days, because,\nlike I said, it's not a big file,\n\n173\n00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.670\nstorage is pretty cost effective, but\nthat may be a consideration there.\n\n174\n00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.990\nSo, these are gonna be your supporting,\nyour features, supporting your roles,\n\n175\n00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.290\nsometimes you'll need them,\nsometimes you don't.\n\n176\n00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:35.002\nBut for RDHCP, we don't need anything,\nso we'll just ahead and hit Next.\n\n177\n00:10:36.654 --> 00:10:40.493\nThis is kind of cool, on this page,\nit's just giving us information\n\n178\n00:10:40.493 --> 00:10:44.160\nthat we might need, we might wanna\nread to familiarize our self.\n\n179\n00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.900\nFor example, things to note,\nwhen you're going to setup a DHCP server,\n\n180\n00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.570\nyou have to have at least\none static IP address.\n\n181\n00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.390\nSo it'll remind you of that, and\nthen it just kind of also reminds, hey,\n\n182\n00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:59.130\nyou need to go and plan out your subnets,\nand at scopes and exclusions.\n\n183\n00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.540\nWe haven't really spoke too much on DHCP,\nI will explain that to you.\n\n184\n00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.500\nSo for now,\nwe're just walking through the role and\n\n185\n00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.470\nthen we'll configure at a later time.\n\n186\n00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:14.438\nWe'll hit Next, On this page you have\nthe ability to go ahead and enable\n\n187\n00:11:14.438 --> 00:11:19.915\nan automatic restart after this particular\nrole has been installed, if it's required.\n\n188\n00:11:19.915 --> 00:11:24.420\nNot all rules require an automatic\nrestart, which is pretty cool because\n\n189\n00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.930\nsometimes restarts can interfere\nwith our production environment.\n\n190\n00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:32.800\nSo I try not to make it a habit to select\nthis because I like to have a little bit\n\n191\n00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.710\nmore control and perform a manual\nrestart if one's required.\n\n192\n00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:40.890\nSo that you're just verifying\nit's not interfering with anyone,\n\n193\n00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:45.070\nwe'll go ahead and hit Install,\nshouldn't take too long here.\n\n194\n00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:49.082\nYou can close this window down and\n\n195\n00:11:49.082 --> 00:11:53.912\nstart performing other activities or\ntasks on a system.\n\n196\n00:11:53.912 --> 00:11:56.007\nIt'll still be running in the background,\n\n197\n00:11:56.007 --> 00:11:59.640\nyou also have the ability down here to\nexport your configuration settings.\n\n198\n00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.920\nWhich is a nice option, because if\nyou wanna setup another server in\n\n199\n00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.550\nexact same way you can create an XML\nfile which will allow you to do so.\n\n200\n00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:12.180\nGreat even for documentation and\nstoring that information,\n\n201\n00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.090\nin case you get audited or\neven just for your IT personnel.\n\n202\n00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:19.410\nSo, give it a few seconds here and\nthat's about it.\n\n203\n00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:23.440\n&gt;&gt; Right, Cherokee, the cool thing about\nthis, right, is really this entire wizard.\n\n204\n00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.470\nWe're not having to figure out step\nby step what needs to be done or\n\n205\n00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:30.210\nwhether there's any previous\nrequirements that we have to have.\n\n206\n00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:35.600\nWhen we select that initial role, it\nnormally tells us with that little dialog\n\n207\n00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.570\nbox that pops up, hey, here are some other\nfeatures that need to be installed or\n\n208\n00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:42.230\nhere's something else that\nwe have to be able to do.\n\n209\n00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.590\nSo if you're not familiar\nwith working with server or\n\n210\n00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.810\ninstalling these roles or features,\nyou don't really have to worry about\n\n211\n00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:51.240\ntoo much when you're doing\nit this particular way.\n\n212\n00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.390\nBut when we get through with this though,\nCherokee's gonna show us how to do this\n\n213\n00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:58.840\nusing the PowerShell, because we've\nemphasized how important it is.\n\n214\n00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.940\nAnd we'll actually see that that one,\nit may require a little bit more,\n\n215\n00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:09.330\nbut overall though the great thing is in\nthis particular type of interface though\n\n216\n00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.330\nit really just requires us to be\npatient and walk through it and\n\n217\n00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.210\nthen it should actually install\nthe way that it needs to.\n\n218\n00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.730\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\nyou bring up a really good point.,\n\n219\n00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.670\nbecause PowerShell is less\nforgiving in that aspect.\n\n220\n00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.810\nSometimes it's just,\nyou hit that button and then it's done,\n\n221\n00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:23.850\nit'll go ahead and execute.\n\n222\n00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:27.830\nSometimes they'll provide\nconfirmation if you will, but\n\n223\n00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.520\nyou can also override that\nwith particular Commandlets.\n\n224\n00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.210\nSo working in the GUI is\na great place to go ahead and\n\n225\n00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.680\nstart, like you said they\ngive you notifications.\n\n226\n00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.240\nMicrosoft also does an excellent\njob supporting TechNet,\n\n227\n00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.988\nwhich is extensive documentation.\n\n228\n00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:48.560\nAnd I would, the more planning\nyou do upfront is going to make\n\n229\n00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.390\nthe process of administrating these\nrules a lot easier in the long-run, and\n\n230\n00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:57.480\nthat's just, I think, with everything\nin IT, or at least what I've found is\n\n231\n00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.190\nthe more time you put ahead of\nthe project, then you'll be better off.\n\n232\n00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:05.028\nBut we're finished here, that was it,\nwe'll go ahead and click Close.\n\n233\n00:14:05.028 --> 00:14:09.960\nI do wanna note that we see a notification\nin the top right-hand corner here, and\n\n234\n00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.130\nthis is gonna remind us that hey,\nyou've installed DHCP, but\n\n235\n00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:14.280\nyou haven't configured it yet.\n\n236\n00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.070\nSo like Ronnie's saying, you're gonna\nget some little training wheels,\n\n237\n00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.280\nif you will, within the GUI here.\n\n238\n00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.610\nBut we do need to jump on over\nto PowerShell to take a look at\n\n239\n00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.518\nhow an installation would happen there.\n\n240\n00:14:26.518 --> 00:14:32.240\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nlaunch PowerShell,\n\n241\n00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.320\nif you right-click on this option here,\n\n242\n00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.480\nyou can see Ronnie was showing us\ndifferent options such as using Ice, and\n\n243\n00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.650\nthe different VX86, and\nthe different versions of PowerShell.\n\n244\n00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:46.180\nSometimes when you're installing\nparticular roles, if you think about it,\n\n245\n00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.480\nit could be a security concern, so\nyou wanna run as administrator.\n\n246\n00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.873\nIt's just an elevated prompt similar\nto your command prompt there,\n\n247\n00:14:54.873 --> 00:14:58.506\ngive me a second, and\nI will just increase the font size so\n\n248\n00:14:58.506 --> 00:15:00.948\nyou guys can see this a little better.\n\n249\n00:15:03.293 --> 00:15:06.463\nI think that should help,\nall right, cool, so\n\n250\n00:15:06.463 --> 00:15:10.844\nwhat we're gonna be installing\nhere is print services feature.\n\n251\n00:15:10.844 --> 00:15:17.584\nSo, the first thing is just to remember\nthat syntax that Ronnie had mentioned.\n\n252\n00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:21.430\nThe verb nonce then we'll go head and\nsay, Install,\n\n253\n00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:25.628\nthe command here is going to be space,\nprint, excuse me.\n\n254\n00:15:25.628 --> 00:15:34.040\nInstall-windowsFeature, And\nthen space -Name.\n\n255\n00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.067\nYou'll go ahead and specify the name\nof that particular service.\n\n256\n00:15:37.067 --> 00:15:41.374\nHere we've got print services and\nit's important to add the hyphen and\n\n257\n00:15:41.374 --> 00:15:44.261\nI know it may not seem like a big deal,\nbut it is.\n\n258\n00:15:44.261 --> 00:15:48.279\n[LAUGH] Otherwise,\nthe system will let you know,\n\n259\n00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:53.179\nlet's see V-I-C-E-S,\nnow it's not a necessity to pay\n\n260\n00:15:53.179 --> 00:15:57.791\nattention to the case here,\nlike upper and lower case.\n\n261\n00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:01.875\nI do that just to make it easier\nto read to really break it down,\n\n262\n00:16:01.875 --> 00:16:04.793\nthat's how like a human eye for\nme anyways.\n\n263\n00:16:04.793 --> 00:16:08.480\nIt's easier to remember, just fyi.\n\n264\n00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.913\nSo we've got Print-Services.\n\n265\n00:16:09.913 --> 00:16:16.686\nNow, this is going to be an additional\nparameter that we can add,\n\n266\n00:16:16.686 --> 00:16:22.640\nso we'll go ahead and\nadd the InstallManagementTools.\n\n267\n00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.880\nAnd this is what we had installed\nthrough the GUI with DHCP,\n\n268\n00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.150\nthis is just the option.\n\n269\n00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:31.100\nWe can go ahead,\nit's always a good idea to go ahead and\n\n270\n00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.420\ninstall those if you're planning on\nmanaging it there locally, as well.\n\n271\n00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:41.000\nSo space, and then now, what I had\ntold you about performing a restart,\n\n272\n00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.350\nhere I can go ahead and hit dash,\nand then initiate a restart here.\n\n273\n00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.600\nAnd hit Enter.\n\n274\n00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:54.010\nNow, when this particular,\noops, I've got a typo here.\n\n275\n00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.370\nLet's see,\ndid I put a t on the end of my restart?\n\n276\n00:17:00.123 --> 00:17:07.222\nInstall, checking my syntax here,\nwindowsFeature,\n\n277\n00:17:07.222 --> 00:17:12.220\nspace Name Print-Services, space.\n\n278\n00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.415\nOkay, I forgot one little spot here.\n\n279\n00:17:14.415 --> 00:17:17.790\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nthis is a good thing to show you,\n\n280\n00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:23.408\nbecause it looks like I forgot to install\nmy subfeatures which we had spoke about.\n\n281\n00:17:23.408 --> 00:17:28.700\nAnd subfeatures are going to be,\nwhere's my syntax here?\n\n282\n00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:33.810\nI'm just gonna go back and show you, it\nshould be before InstallManagementTools.\n\n283\n00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:40.901\nSo my subfeature, so I'll go ahead and\n-IncludeAllSubFeature.\n\n284\n00:17:43.311 --> 00:17:48.329\nU-R-E, all right, and\nthen IncludeManagementTools.\n\n285\n00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.300\n&gt;&gt; That probably should be\na dash instead of an underscore.\n\n286\n00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.119\n&gt;&gt; Underscore, okay,\nsorry, I always do that.\n\n287\n00:17:59.197 --> 00:18:02.941\nYou're right.\n\n288\n00:18:07.465 --> 00:18:10.310\nAll right, and then for\nour restart, -Restart, that's it.\n\n289\n00:18:15.947 --> 00:18:20.609\nR-E-S-T-A-R-T, okay.\n\n290\n00:18:20.609 --> 00:18:23.210\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, that's a lot of\ntyping that you just did right there.\n\n291\n00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.240\nRemember also that as\nCherokee was typing out,\n\n292\n00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.300\nshe was doing it because that's how\nshe conscientiously does things.\n\n293\n00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.270\nFor me, I probably would have started and\nthen use the Tab and\n\n294\n00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:35.680\nlet it actually fill in.\n\n295\n00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.720\nSometimes it will work for you, and you'll\nbe able to see if you don't hit anything.\n\n296\n00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.480\nBut on a lot of, especially those long\ncommands, PowerShell is really good.\n\n297\n00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.400\nOnce you get it started enough to\nwhere it knows what it can type in,\n\n298\n00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.230\nusing that Tab complete really can\nhelp us to kind of reduce that down.\n\n299\n00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.520\nBut I know that Cherokee likes to do that.\n\n300\n00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I like to type mine out because as\nyou can see, I'm not the best typer here.\n\n301\n00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.850\nSo by getting that extra little\npractice in, it really helps,\n\n302\n00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.720\nand it helps me remember the syntax too.\n\n303\n00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.910\nBecause like we'd spoke about\nwith PowerShell Microsoft,\n\n304\n00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.580\nif you plan on taking Microsoft exams,\n\n305\n00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:12.040\nwhich I have, and they love just\nmaking sure you know the syntax well.\n\n306\n00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.860\nSo it helps me retain that information.\n\n307\n00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:18.075\nSo this this'll just take a minute, but\nbecause I have initiated that restart,\n\n308\n00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:22.625\nthis machine, it's a virtual environment,\nwe're gonna lose connectivity.\n\n309\n00:19:22.625 --> 00:19:27.550\nSo I'll have to go ahead and reboot there,\nwe'll wait until it reboots, I should say.\n\n310\n00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:28.980\nSo it's just gonna take a minute.\n\n311\n00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:34.490\nBut you can always check your work by\nusing the Get-WindowsFeature option,\n\n312\n00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:38.450\nso you can see if hey,\nis this particular feature installed?\n\n313\n00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:39.910\nDid I uninstall it?\n\n314\n00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.420\nAnd we'll take a look at that also,\nwe've got some time left.\n\n315\n00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:47.430\nSo I'll just give it a second here and\nthen try to reconnect to this machine.\n\n316\n00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.179\nIt's actually physically rebooting.\n\n317\n00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:05.470\nGive it another second.\n\n318\n00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:11.330\nOkay, looks like we're back up,\ngood to go here.\n\n319\n00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.330\nNow you can see it says Working on\nfeatures, okay, you could see it,\n\n320\n00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:15.940\nit lost connectivity real quick.\n\n321\n00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:20.750\nBut as it reboots,\nit's still working on installing\n\n322\n00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:25.110\nthose particular features that I just\nrequested from that PowerShell command\n\n323\n00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:29.862\nthere And so once this comes up,\n\n324\n00:20:29.862 --> 00:20:34.090\nwere gonna check our work to see if the\nfeature has been successfully installed.\n\n325\n00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:38.040\nAnd then I think we might break things,\nRonnie, and go ahead and uninstall.\n\n326\n00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.810\nBecause sometimes we don't want\nall those additional features, and\n\n327\n00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.620\nwe wanna have that really hardened system.\n\n328\n00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:47.040\nSo we can actually remove those features\nfrom the operating system as well.\n\n329\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.550\n&gt;&gt; And that brings up a good point,\nCherokee, that there may be machines that\n\n330\n00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:55.260\nyou end up working on,\nas maybe let's say your first role as\n\n331\n00:20:55.260 --> 00:21:00.000\nsomeone supporting the servers, where they\nare starting to remove certain roles.\n\n332\n00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.120\nSo not only the idea here of understanding\nwhat you need to add in is important.\n\n333\n00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.550\nBut also removing it and then verifying\nthat everything is done as well.\n\n334\n00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.670\nSo, Cherokee, we're just gonna\nsee this inside of the, we're\n\n335\n00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:14.090\nactually just verifying now, that it's\nactually been installed using PowerShell.\n\n336\n00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.750\n&gt;&gt; Right, we're just going to go ahead and\ncheck our work here, so\n\n337\n00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:24.409\nwe'll just type in Get-WindowsFeature\nspace Print-Services And\n\n338\n00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:28.905\nnow Ronnie showed you different\nways you can query and look for\n\n339\n00:21:28.905 --> 00:21:31.550\nall the installed services.\n\n340\n00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:36.650\nYou can even pipe that out and\nreally filter\n\n341\n00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:41.340\nyour query and display the information\nthat you're specifically looking for.\n\n342\n00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.820\nBut here I'm just checking on\nthat one individual service.\n\n343\n00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:50.530\nSo if I see here, this little x\nmeans that yes, it is installed.\n\n344\n00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:52.570\nAnd if you were to go ahead and\n\n345\n00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:57.080\nview a list,\nit would be empty there if it wasn't.\n\n346\n00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.960\nAnd if you scroll on over,\nyou'll see the print name, so\n\n347\n00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.900\nthis is the correct syntax here.\n\n348\n00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:07.290\nAnd the installed state is Installed.\n\n349\n00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:07.860\nAnd so\n\n350\n00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.880\nAvailable means it's available within\nthat operating system to be installed.\n\n351\n00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:18.390\nBut now let's go ahead and uninstall it,\nso we'll go ahead and remove it here.\n\n352\n00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:24.362\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\ntype in uninstall,\n\n353\n00:22:24.362 --> 00:22:28.770\n[COUGH] -windowsFeature,\n\n354\n00:22:32.458 --> 00:22:36.244\nAnd then again, it's pretty similar\nin the structure, Name space and\n\n355\n00:22:36.244 --> 00:22:38.779\nthen Print-Services, again using the dash.\n\n356\n00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.730\nHere we're gonna go ahead and\nspecify the Remove parameter.\n\n357\n00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:54.160\nAnd again, specify the Restart,\nand hit Enter.\n\n358\n00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.380\nSo it is a lot of typing, but\n\n359\n00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:02.926\nthere's a lot more granularity and\ncontrol I have.\n\n360\n00:23:02.926 --> 00:23:06.480\nWhenever I'm using PowerShell,\nI can deploy this across several machines,\n\n361\n00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.780\nI can manage these systems remotely.\n\n362\n00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.140\nJust giving me a lot of\ndifferent options here, Ronnie.\n\n363\n00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, so\nonce its actually removed,\n\n364\n00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.060\nthe great thing is we can use the same\ncommand that we did to verify its\n\n365\n00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:21.340\ninstallation, to verify that its\nactually have been uninstalled.\n\n366\n00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.620\nAnd this is an important concept\nthat we need to learn how to do as,\n\n367\n00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.110\nof course, sysadmins.\n\n368\n00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:28.660\nMost of us don't think about this.\n\n369\n00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:32.490\nIf we choose to take a server and\nwe go, we're not gonna use that for\n\n370\n00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:36.210\nthe print services any longer,\nwell, we can leave it installed.\n\n371\n00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:37.870\nWe can leave the print services installed.\n\n372\n00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:38.390\n&gt;&gt; But why?\n\n373\n00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.910\n&gt;&gt; But why,\nwhy would we actually choose to do that?\n\n374\n00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:44.490\nBest practice though is,\nlike what Cherokee has talking about,\n\n375\n00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:46.584\nremoving it for a smaller footprint.\n\n376\n00:23:46.584 --> 00:23:50.575\nBut also at the same time, right, not\nmaking temptation to actually just have\n\n377\n00:23:50.575 --> 00:23:54.565\nprinter out there that happens to,\njust because nobody's using it anymore,\n\n378\n00:23:54.565 --> 00:23:57.000\nsomebody may find that\nas an open opportunity.\n\n379\n00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.798\nSo we don't wanna do that.\n\n380\n00:23:58.798 --> 00:24:01.726\nAll right Cherokee, so what are we\nactually gonna take a look at here?\n\n381\n00:24:01.726 --> 00:24:04.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so, like you said,\nwe could use that same command.\n\n382\n00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:09.031\nI did wanna show you an option, so\nwe could get a little more information,\n\n383\n00:24:09.031 --> 00:24:11.890\nlike I was mentioning,\nto specify that query.\n\n384\n00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:16.114\nBut I'm still stuck at 45% removal, so\nI think we might go ahead and take a TV\n\n385\n00:24:16.114 --> 00:24:20.542\ntimeout, so we're not wasting your time,\nand then come back and check our work.\n\n386\n00:24:20.542 --> 00:24:25.174\nOkay, so our particular role, the print\nservices role has been successfully\n\n387\n00:24:25.174 --> 00:24:29.940\nuninstalled and in order to verify that,\nwe could've used that same command.\n\n388\n00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:34.290\nBut here, I've saved you guys a little\nbit of torture and you don't have to sit\n\n389\n00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:39.370\nthrough my typing, so I'm just going\nto go ahead and hit the up arrow, oops.\n\n390\n00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.070\nAnd there we go, not the clear.\n\n391\n00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:45.840\nBut pull in the previous command that I\nhad issued and it's Get-windowsFeature,\n\n392\n00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.370\nand you're using the pike, and you're\nspecifying where the FeatureType is true.\n\n393\n00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:53.240\nSo, we're looking at particular\nfeatures that are in fact\n\n394\n00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.622\ninstalled on this machine.\n\n395\n00:24:54.622 --> 00:24:59.752\nThe output will show the DisplayName and\n\n396\n00:24:59.752 --> 00:25:02.715\nthen the installation state, so\nwe'll go ahead and hit enter here.\n\n397\n00:25:02.715 --> 00:25:04.970\nIt'll just take a second.\n\n398\n00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.010\nAnd you can see all the different\nroles that have been installed\n\n399\n00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.790\non this particular machine here.\n\n400\n00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.030\nAnd I do not see our print services.\n\n401\n00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:18.900\nLet me just verify that.\n\n402\n00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:24.200\nNow, you could also play\naround with the commands.\n\n403\n00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.690\nSo that's good,\nthat's what we were looking for.\n\n404\n00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.300\nWe wanted to uninstall.\n\n405\n00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.110\nBut if you look at the syntax of\nthat command, you could also change\n\n406\n00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:34.900\nthis true to false, and then it would\ngive you the inverse, the opposite.\n\n407\n00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.660\nSo, definitely play around in\nPowerShell and know that, yes,\n\n408\n00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:42.080\nyou have the ability to go ahead and\ninstall and manage roles for the GUI,\n\n409\n00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.300\nbut then you also have that\nability through PowerShell.\n\n410\n00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:49.608\nAnd one of our viewers\nin chat reminded me of\n\n411\n00:25:49.608 --> 00:25:54.350\na particular function where through\nthe GUI interface there are also\n\n412\n00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:59.340\nthe PowerShell syntax,\nthe commandlets, to help you kind of\n\n413\n00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.420\ntransition into PowerShell if you're still\ntrying to get your feet wet with that.\n\n414\n00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.090\nSo that's pretty cool too.\n\n415\n00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:04.660\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n416\n00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:08.220\nIt gives us that ability if we're really\ntrying to practice PowerShell to get part\n\n417\n00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:12.350\nway through that GUI interface and\nit might even show you right then.\n\n418\n00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:16.245\nWhen you go and take a look at it, all of\nthose, the ways that you can install it\n\n419\n00:26:16.245 --> 00:26:20.030\nthat way and instead of just you\ncopying and pasting it in there, right?\n\n420\n00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:23.340\nTry and type it out and get used to that\nfeature because you're gonna see that\n\n421\n00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:28.130\nmore and more to the point where one day,\nprobably that GUI management interface\n\n422\n00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:31.760\nis gonna be relied upon less,\nespecially in the Windows world.\n\n423\n00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.870\nSo, don't think that you're\ngetting way from it.\n\n424\n00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.925\nAs much as we're trying to\nshow you both at this point,\n\n425\n00:26:35.925 --> 00:26:39.550\nbecause it's still probably\nheavily used overall.\n\n426\n00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.260\nYou're still gonna be pushed, and\n\n427\n00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.800\nwe're gonna push you toward doing as\nmuch in PowerShell as possible too.\n\n428\n00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.970\nAll right, Cherokee,\n\n429\n00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:51.250\nanything else that we need to know about\nadding and the Windows features and roles?\n\n430\n00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.250\n&gt;&gt; I think we'll be going\nthroughout this series and\n\n431\n00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.300\nlooking at different roles and features.\n\n432\n00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.660\nSo, we'll get a little bit\nmore exposure to that.\n\n433\n00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.060\nBut for now,\nI think we're at a good point.\n\n434\n00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.174\nAll right, well, thank you,\nand Cherokee for helping us.\n\n435\n00:27:03.174 --> 00:27:07.039\nRemember that what you actually saw here,\nright, is the different ways or\n\n436\n00:27:07.039 --> 00:27:10.520\nthe different roles and features\nthat we can install using the GUI,\n\n437\n00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:15.618\nas well as the PowerShell, and even the\nuninstallation of those features as well.\n\n438\n00:27:15.618 --> 00:27:19.030\nBoth of these are management concepts\nthat we all have to get used to.\n\n439\n00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.770\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n440\n00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:24.640\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n441\n00:27:24.640

Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.530\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.360\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me Ronnie,\nhow are you today?\n\n13\n00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.182\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n14\n00:00:29.182 --> 00:00:33.605\nSo Cherokee, when we start taking a look\nat networking fundamentals, most of us,\n\n15\n00:00:33.605 --> 00:00:36.730\nas we've gotten into this point and\nwe're interested in watching this show,\n\n16\n00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.220\nwe've got a little bit\na background in networking.\n\n17\n00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.650\nBut not at the server level and\nnot what we might expect sometimes.\n\n18\n00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.110\nSo where are we gonna get started today?\n\n19\n00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.610\n&gt;&gt; You know you're so right, Ronnie.\n\n20\n00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.300\nYou may have already experienced some of\nthat background networking knowledge,\n\n21\n00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.120\nbut here we're gonna be looking\nat it in a practical sense.\n\n22\n00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.220\nAnd I really love\nthe composition of this book,\n\n23\n00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.580\nbecause before diving into actually\nconfiguring DHCP and DNS, we're gonna\n\n24\n00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.680\ntake a moment here to just make sure you\nreally understand the core fundamentals\n\n25\n00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.660\nof networking because that part doesn't\nchange between different vendors.\n\n26\n00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.190\nSo this is something,\n\n27\n00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.520\nsome of those concepts that you can\ntake with you and have with you.\n\n28\n00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.210\nI mean, if you look at networking,\nthe historical portion of it,\n\n29\n00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.010\na lot of it's been fundamentally\nthe same since the beginning.\n\n30\n00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.200\nSo I think that's where we'll go ahead and\nstart.\n\n31\n00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.570\nIf you think about subnetting and\nwhat is this notion of subnetting,\n\n32\n00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.910\nlike, why are we even doing it?\n\n33\n00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.260\nIf we take a look at my screen,\n\n34\n00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.580\nI just kind of wanna remind you\nguys of where we came from.\n\n35\n00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.230\nThis image,\nthis is a network diagram of ARPANET.\n\n36\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.820\nSo basically the internet at its infancy,\nand\n\n37\n00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.260\nthis was a diagram from December of 1970.\n\n38\n00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.820\nAnd you can see the different nodes, like\na dozen nodes on this particular network.\n\n39\n00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.680\nThere wasn't a lot that was involved\nat this particular point in time.\n\n40\n00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.810\nPeople know each other that they\nwere communicating with, they didn't\n\n41\n00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.820\nhave to worry about things like security\nand running out of IP addresses.\n\n42\n00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.170\nAnd if we look at the different\naddresses down here.\n\n43\n00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.610\nWe talk about, you guys are probably\nare familiar with IPv4 but\n\n44\n00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.290\nare also acclimated with IPv6 because most\nof the vendors nowadays wanna prep you and\n\n45\n00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.390\nmake sure that you're ready for\nthat shift.\n\n46\n00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.596\nSo If we look at the address space we\nhave 4 billion something versus 340\n\n47\n00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:24.640\numdizillion that is a huge\nsignificant difference there.\n\n48\n00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.760\nSo we haven't fully transitioned\ninto that IPv6 land yet.\n\n49\n00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.620\nSo making sure we take Advantage and\n\n50\n00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.620\nutilize the current IPv4 addresses\n\n51\n00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.620\nappropriately is one reason why you would\nwanna go ahead and utilize subnetting.\n\n52\n00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.030\nAnother reason would be\nto increase security.\n\n53\n00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.830\nAnd by doing so, it's kind of twofold\nhere, because you're increasing security.\n\n54\n00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.880\nActually threefold,\n\n55\n00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.660\nyou're speeding up your networks\nby logically segmenting them.\n\n56\n00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.890\nAnd you're also adding ease\nto your administration.\n\n57\n00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.480\nSo you can logically group different\nportions of your network so\n\n58\n00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.710\nyou can apply different security\naccess control lists and\n\n59\n00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.550\ndifferent parameters there\nby segmenting your network.\n\n60\n00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.880\nSo subnetting is segmenting via addresses.\n\n61\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.000\nAnd there are other different ways you can\nlogically separate your network like VLANs\n\n62\n00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.960\nfor instance, but in this show we're gonna\nreally be taking a look at subnetting.\n\n63\n00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.843\nSo I also want to kind of break it down\nfor you in an easy to understand format.\n\n64\n00:03:28.843 --> 00:03:32.831\nYou may already be familiar with this,\nit's fine, it's just a review but\n\n65\n00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:36.840\neven starting in A+ (Plus),\nyou had to remember your classes, right?\n\n66\n00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.540\nSo we're not really not gonna\nbe focusing on D or E here,\n\n67\n00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.840\nwe're just gonna be looking at A,\nB and C for now,\n\n68\n00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.650\nand those are gonna be our subnet masks.\n\n69\n00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.120\nAnd if you think about a subnet mask,\na subnet mask is kind of,\n\n70\n00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.040\nI don't know Ronnie,\nit's like an identifier, if you will.\n\n71\n00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.040\nSo it's a key, that a lot of these\ndevices use, for instance like a router,\n\n72\n00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.830\nwhenever it's receiving packets, it uses\nthis information to help identify if, hey,\n\n73\n00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.560\nis this particular IP\naddress on my network?\n\n74\n00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.070\nDo I need to send it elsewhere?\n\n75\n00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.580\nSo it's very useful in that aspect.\n\n76\n00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.290\nWhen we look at it written in this format,\nthis is called dotted decimal notation and\n\n77\n00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.430\nthese are your standard\nclassful subnet masks.\n\n78\n00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.260\nWhen we look at it broken down into\nbinary, it provides a bit of an insight.\n\n79\n00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.120\nAnd I kind of color-coded it here\njust because it may help some people.\n\n80\n00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.240\nOn the left-hand side, the 1s are gonna\nbe representing our network bits.\n\n81\n00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.720\nSo this is the network\nportion of your subnet mask.\n\n82\n00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.920\nThe right hand side, over here, if you\nlook to the right, everything in orange,\n\n83\n00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.380\nthe zeros are gonna be\nrepresenting your host bits.\n\n84\n00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.950\nNow, we don't have a lot\nof wiggle room with\n\n85\n00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.420\nthe design that we are giving here for\nour A, B, and C address spaces.\n\n86\n00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:05.540\nSo if we needed to modify those to\nhelp save address space and not to.\n\n87\n00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.230\nI guess when we're looking at another\nreason why we would wanna do this,\n\n88\n00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.650\nwe talked about speed.\n\n89\n00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.940\nBut it really helps the hardware\ndevices by not having to\n\n90\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.960\nadd in all this unnecessary information.\n\n91\n00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.820\nSo you'll see faster computations there.\n\n92\n00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.430\nSo we're saving the address\nspaces by customizing.\n\n93\n00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.390\nAnd we can do that,\nwe can break things up a little bit.\n\n94\n00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.430\nThe only rule that we\nreally have to follow here\n\n95\n00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.920\nwhenever we're creating a custom subnet,\nso class list, interdomain routing, or\n\n96\n00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.670\nyou may hear variable length subnet masks.\n\n97\n00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.750\nThose terms being used, is that our 1s,\nour network bits, always have to be\n\n98\n00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.400\ncontiguous to the left, and then our host\nbits have to be contiguous to the right.\n\n99\n00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.290\nSo if you think about that for\na second, the only possible\n\n100\n00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.120\npossibilities for those particular\nnumbers are gonna be in this fashion.\n\n101\n00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.420\nWhich if you have the opportunity\nto just go ahead and\n\n102\n00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.760\nmemorize these numbers right here, it\nwill really help increase your speed and\n\n103\n00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.100\nefficiency if you do plan on taking tests.\n\n104\n00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.860\nIt's just a little more native,\nI guess, natural.\n\n105\n00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.980\nSo knowing this, this will really\nhelp you out, this little chart here.\n\n106\n00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.890\nNow if we look at the breakdown\nof an IPv4 address,\n\n107\n00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.600\nwe can see here there\nare four different sections.\n\n108\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.418\nEach one of these sections are called\nan octet, an octet, oct, eight,\n\n109\n00:06:26.418 --> 00:06:33.280\nthey're eight bits in each one and\nthere's a dividing line.\n\n110\n00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.150\nIf you see here it's very distinct\nwith these particular subnet masks.\n\n111\n00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.376\nWe've got a dividing line\nbetween the 1s and the 0s here.\n\n112\n00:06:40.376 --> 00:06:44.620\nThe 1s and the 0s here, and\nthen here, for Class C.\n\n113\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.300\nNow if we go ahead and switch things up\nand we use one of these other numbers for\n\n114\n00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.580\nour particular octet, then that's going\nto be called our interesting octet.\n\n115\n00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.220\nSo wherever that change is happening,\n\n116\n00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.630\nyou just might wanna be\nfamiliar with that term.\n\n117\n00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.880\nThere's also another term, so the number\none that's all the way to your right,\n\n118\n00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.410\nyou may also hear that being called\nyour least significant bit there.\n\n119\n00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.620\nBut it is kind of significant,\nwe'll talk about that in a moment.\n\n120\n00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.320\nBut I just kinda wanted\nto remind you of that.\n\n121\n00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.420\nSo, couple different ways\nyou can write things out.\n\n122\n00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.250\nYou even see here at the end,\nthat I have here in pink,\n\n123\n00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.890\nthis is a different shorthand\nversion that you'll see quite often.\n\n124\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.840\nThis is called slashed notations.\n\n125\n00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.460\nSo just a little reminder here,\nremember your address ranges for\n\n126\n00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.310\nyour different classes.\n\n127\n00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.840\nIt's gonna be important when you're\nconfiguring your particular servers moving\n\n128\n00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.380\nforward.\n\n129\n00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.981\nAll right, what happens in a production\nenvironment in a practical situation\n\n130\n00:07:38.981 --> 00:07:43.090\nwhen your boss comes to you or\nyour team, your IT department, and\n\n131\n00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:48.125\nsays hey guys look, we're looking at\nbuilding up, expanding our network.\n\n132\n00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:51.415\nI want to go ahead and create a portion\nthat looks something like this.\n\n133\n00:07:51.415 --> 00:07:55.195\nWe have three different sites and\nwe want to go ahead and connect maybe or\n\n134\n00:07:55.195 --> 00:07:56.965\njust segments within a network.\n\n135\n00:07:56.965 --> 00:08:00.405\nAnd we want to go ahead and\nconnect them in this way with two.\n\n136\n00:08:00.405 --> 00:08:01.127\nParticular links here.\n\n137\n00:08:01.127 --> 00:08:05.930\nWe've got site A, or segment A,\nsegment B, and segment C.\n\n138\n00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:10.270\nAnd something we have to think about here\nis, okay, so what does that call for?\n\n139\n00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:14.360\nUsually whenever you're asked to\ndesign a network, there's going to be\n\n140\n00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.810\nsome kind of conversation happening,\ntranspiring what you're saying,\n\n141\n00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.220\nhey, what are the needs,\nwhat are we looking at here.?\n\n142\n00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.070\nDo we need to really focus on security?\n\n143\n00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.620\nDo we have to worry about an old system\nthat we have to remain compatible with?\n\n144\n00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.310\nHow many devices are gonna be connecting?\n\n145\n00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.680\nHow many users are gonna be\nusing this system, this network.\n\n146\n00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.480\nSo there's a lot to think about there.\n\n147\n00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.070\nIn this particular scenario,\nI can identify that I need at least\n\n148\n00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.640\nfive different networks for\nthese three particular segments and\n\n149\n00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.040\nthen appoint to point link for\neach one of those.\n\n150\n00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.430\nSo five is going to be my minimum here and\nthat's going to be my goal.\n\n151\n00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.600\nSo if someone were to ask\nyou how to configure that,\n\n152\n00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.360\nwe'll get to that by\nutilizing our DHCP and\n\n153\n00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.760\nin shows coming up we'll show\nyou how to go ahead and do that.\n\n154\n00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.940\nSo, let's just say that the original\nIP address that we were given for\n\n155\n00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.310\nthat task is going to be 216.10.1.0.\n\n156\n00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:11.750\nNow, in order to do that we need to,\nthese are just really three basic steps.\n\n157\n00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:16.520\nYou'll probably find numerous ways that\nshow how to subnet on the Internet,\n\n158\n00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.230\nbut maybe you talked to some other people.\n\n159\n00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.270\nIt seems like everyone\nhas their own style.\n\n160\n00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.510\nWe have some really great shows.\n\n161\n00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.140\nActually Ronnie,\n\n162\n00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:28.030\nyou were working with Todd Lammle, and\nthey're doing it all in their heads.\n\n163\n00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.130\nSo, you could get that\ngood one day as well.\n\n164\n00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.660\nBut for now,\nwe're just gonna stick to this three step,\n\n165\n00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.440\neasy method to get us\nthrough this process.\n\n166\n00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.630\nSo if I take a look at the number\nfive in decimal notation,\n\n167\n00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:45.680\nright, decimal ten base numbering system,\n\n168\n00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.360\nI need to go ahead and\nconvert that to binary, step number one.\n\n169\n00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.590\nSo I take the number of networks and\nconvert it to binary, so\n\n170\n00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.150\nmy number's going to be five and\n\n171\n00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:01.830\nI think I might do a little exercise real\nquick with you Ronnie, what do you think?\n\n172\n00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.480\nShould we do it in decimal\nto binary conversion?\n\n173\n00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.004\n&gt;&gt; That's up to you.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n174\n00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:06.750\n&gt;&gt; We'll do it.\n\n175\n00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.700\n&gt;&gt; Let's do one,\njust to kind of remember how.\n\n176\n00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.450\nSome of you may or\n\n177\n00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:14.940\nmay not have, but I think that'll help us\nout through these remaining steps here.\n\n178\n00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:21.850\nSo we'll just go ahead and take 216, the\nfirst octet of this particular IP address.\n\n179\n00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.560\nAnd what I like to do, let me just\ncopy and paste this real quick.\n\n180\n00:10:32.652 --> 00:10:38.199\nIf you take this number, and kind of put\nit above, and this little chart that I'm\n\n181\n00:10:38.199 --> 00:10:43.360\nusing guys, I'm simply taking two to\nthe power of zero which gives us one.\n\n182\n00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.080\nTwo to the power of one which\ngives us two, and so forth.\n\n183\n00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:53.030\nAnd if you see there are eight different\nnumbers here, so it just kind of\n\n184\n00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.100\nhelps you remember, and you'll start\nseeing these patterns over and over and\n\n185\n00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.880\nif you're doubling up on these numbers.\n\n186\n00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.210\n128, and then you keep going.\n\n187\n00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.620\nYou'll even see a lot of\nrepetitions there as well.\n\n188\n00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.470\nEven in bigger numbers like 512, 1,024.\n\n189\n00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.670\nYou're looking at storage sizes.\n\n190\n00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:14.050\nAnd that's because we're\nworking with our binary,\n\n191\n00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:15.554\nwhich is a base-2 numbering system.\n\n192\n00:11:15.554 --> 00:11:18.880\nThere's not a ton of potential\noutcomes that you could have.\n\n193\n00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.910\nSo you'll start seeing\nthose patterns happen.\n\n194\n00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:23.290\nAll right.\n\n195\n00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:27.920\nSo now that we've got our\n216 above the 128, I'm going\n\n196\n00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.560\nto ask you to kinda change of thinking\nbecause we are working in binary here.\n\n197\n00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.240\nSo instead of saying yes or no, Ronnie\nmaybe you can help me out with this and\n\n198\n00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.695\nsay one or\nzero whenever I ask you a question.\n\n199\n00:11:39.695 --> 00:11:40.430\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n200\n00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.031\n&gt;&gt; How is this.\n\n201\n00:11:41.031 --> 00:11:42.639\nAre you okay with that?\n&gt;&gt; Sure, I can do that.\n\n202\n00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:43.970\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n203\n00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.327\nSo the 1 is going to be your answer for\nyes.\n\n204\n00:11:48.327 --> 00:11:50.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n&gt;&gt; So that's our on.\n\n205\n00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.062\nThe off, the no, is gonna be 0.\n\n206\n00:11:53.062 --> 00:11:56.150\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so 216,\n\n207\n00:11:56.150 --> 00:12:00.479\ncan we extract 128 out of 216?\n\n208\n00:12:00.479 --> 00:12:04.407\n&gt;&gt; You can definitely\nsubtract 128 from 216, so 1.\n\n209\n00:12:04.407 --> 00:12:05.959\n&gt;&gt; 1, awesome.\n\n210\n00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:08.550\nLet me go ahead and put a 1 there.\n\n211\n00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:13.930\nAll right, now this is where I'm gonna\nneed your help Ronnie, all right?\n\n212\n00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.740\nIf I have 216, and I extract 128,\nwhat am I left with?\n\n213\n00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.920\nDo I have a remainder here?\n\n214\n00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.530\n&gt;&gt; You will have a remainder there.\n\n215\n00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.860\nThat would be what something-\n&gt;&gt; Ctrl+V, I'm still pasting here.\n\n216\n00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.218\n&gt;&gt; Would that be-\n&gt;&gt; Should I get the calculator here?\n\n217\n00:12:30.218 --> 00:12:31.674\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou'll have to get the calculator here.\n\n218\n00:12:31.674 --> 00:12:34.492\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, sorry guys,\nwe are doing this on the fly.\n\n219\n00:12:34.492 --> 00:12:41.340\n&gt;&gt; Should be 86 I think but I-\n&gt;&gt; 216- 128, we'll just verify our work.\n\n220\n00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:41.898\n&gt;&gt; 88.\n\n221\n00:12:41.898 --> 00:12:42.714\n&gt;&gt; 88 all right.\n\n222\n00:12:42.714 --> 00:12:43.854\n&gt;&gt; I see I can't subtract.\n\n223\n00:12:43.854 --> 00:12:46.625\n&gt;&gt; Now I will say that with\nthat being said, oops.\n\n224\n00:12:46.625 --> 00:12:48.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We do have\n\n225\n00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.670\nsubnet calculators in real life.\n\n226\n00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.870\nThe main reason I'm\nshowing you this now and\n\n227\n00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.100\nI know that this particular show is\nnot attached to the certification.\n\n228\n00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.610\nBecause if it were a lot of certification\nvendors require you to know how to do this\n\n229\n00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:03.770\nso that you can execute that on an exam\nwithout the use of a subnet calculator.\n\n230\n00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:07.280\nBecause in real life we do\nhave those at our disposal.\n\n231\n00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.100\nBut I wanna show you this so\nyou fundamentally understand\n\n232\n00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.720\nwhere these numbers are coming from and\nyou're plugging and\n\n233\n00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.560\nchugging them into a server, because that\ncould get you in trouble in the long-run.\n\n234\n00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.030\nYou really need to understand\nwhy before you execute it.\n\n235\n00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.570\nI'm going to ask you this\nnext question here, Ronnie.\n\n236\n00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:26.620\nCan we extract 64 out of 88?\n\n237\n00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.570\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's a one.\n\n238\n00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:29.110\n&gt;&gt; That's a one.\n\n239\n00:13:33.241 --> 00:13:36.423\nAll right, and\nthen at this particular part right here,\n\n240\n00:13:36.423 --> 00:13:38.820\nwe're going to talk about our remainder.\n\n241\n00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.850\nDo we have a remainder leftover?\n\n242\n00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:41.360\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n243\n00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.950\n&gt;&gt; All right, and what would that be?\n\n244\n00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:43.453\n&gt;&gt; 24.\n\n245\n00:13:43.453 --> 00:13:47.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nyou can see the pattern here.\n\n246\n00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:52.720\nIt's pretty, I'm just asking\nRonnie I'm moving my remainder over and\n\n247\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.030\nthen we're gonna say,\nhey can we extract 32 out 24?\n\n248\n00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:58.160\n&gt;&gt; No, start with zero.\n\n249\n00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.120\n&gt;&gt; Must be a no.\n\n250\n00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.300\nThat's right, all right.\n\n251\n00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.366\nSo we'll put a 0 here for our placeholder,\n\n252\n00:14:05.366 --> 00:14:07.560\nbecause we're looking to\nobtain those 8 bits here.\n\n253\n00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.070\nAnd that's what this chart can really\ndo for us, help us out in that way.\n\n254\n00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.590\nNow I'm just gonna slide the 24\nover because we verified we cannot\n\n255\n00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.610\ntake 32 out of 24.\n\n256\n00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.350\nBut what about 16 out of 24?\n\n257\n00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.070\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nSo that's the one.\n\n258\n00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.790\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n259\n00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.070\nSo we'll go ahead and put a 1.\n\n260\n00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.410\nAnd then what kind of\nnumber are we left with?\n\n261\n00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.980\n&gt;&gt; An 8.\n&gt;&gt; An 8, all right.\n\n262\n00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.170\nSo can we extract 8 out 8?\n\n263\n00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.380\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n264\n00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:32.904\nThat would be a 1.\n\n265\n00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.300\n&gt;&gt; All right, now what do we do?\n\n266\n00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.730\nWe have no remainder.\n\n267\n00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:41.496\nSo, at this point in time,\nwe're just gonna go ahead and\n\n268\n00:14:41.496 --> 00:14:43.618\nfill that in with 0, 0 and 0.\n\n269\n00:14:43.618 --> 00:14:50.190\nSo it's not beautiful, but I think\nyou guys get the point here, right?\n\n270\n00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:55.390\nSo that's how we can go ahead and take\na decimal number and convert it to binary.\n\n271\n00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:58.150\nThe more you work at this,\nthe faster you will become.\n\n272\n00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:01.950\nAnd if you wanted to go ahead and\ncheck your work in every column\n\n273\n00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:06.370\nin which you have a number one, you take\nthat number and add it together, and\n\n274\n00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.270\nthat should be your\noriginal decimal number.\n\n275\n00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:13.620\nSo 128 plus 64 plus 16\nplus 8 should equal 216,\n\n276\n00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.810\nso that's just how we're\ngetting that information.\n\n277\n00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.030\nAll right, let me move this over so\nwe can clean up our spot, and\n\n278\n00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.460\ntake a look back here at step number one.\n\n279\n00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:28.780\nSo if, I'm just gonna steal this, and\nchange that to a 5, not a percent sign.\n\n280\n00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.690\nBecause our boss had told us that\nwe needed to create 5 networks.\n\n281\n00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:37.984\nSo, if I still follow this concept,\nall right, can I take 128 out of 5?\n\n282\n00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.191\nNo.\nSo I'm gonna put a zero there and I really\n\n283\n00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:48.442\ndon't need to do this at this detailed\nlevel because I can see that I'm not gonna\n\n284\n00:15:48.442 --> 00:15:54.720\nbe able to get anything out of this until\nI move it all the way here to my four.\n\n285\n00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.800\nSo I can at this point is\nwhere I would get my yes.\n\n286\n00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.590\nSo I now know that it takes three bits.\n\n287\n00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:06.350\nLet me find a little highlighter\ntool here, or some kind of pencil.\n\n288\n00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.920\nThree bits to make\nthe number five in binary.\n\n289\n00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.830\nFollowing?\n\n290\n00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.660\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I have three bits here.\n\n291\n00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:19.960\nNow if I look at this particular IP\naddress that I was originally given,\n\n292\n00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.420\nand we just spoke about our\ndifferent classes, right Ronnie.\n\n293\n00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:29.770\nSo if I look at that, what class\nsubnet mass does that fall into here?\n\n294\n00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:30.890\n&gt;&gt; In Class C.\n\n295\n00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's exactly right.\n\n296\n00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.670\nSo if I think about my Class C\nsubnet mask right here,\n\n297\n00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.730\nso this is it written in\ndot decimal notation.\n\n298\n00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:43.700\nHere I have it written in our binary.\n\n299\n00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.471\nSo if I take this particular address,\nand then I add, or\n\n300\n00:16:49.471 --> 00:16:54.335\nmodify, the three bits cuz we\njust said three bits, right.\n\n301\n00:16:54.335 --> 00:16:57.930\nSo let's change,\nmaybe I should get a thicker pencil here.\n\n302\n00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:06.550\nChange these three bits we're\nborrowing from our hosts.\n\n303\n00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.070\nI don't know why they say borrowing\nbecause it's not like we're really\n\n304\n00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.800\ngiving them back at any point in time.\n\n305\n00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.340\nBut that's what it's called, you're\nborrowing bits from your host portion and\n\n306\n00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:17.300\nadding to your network portion.\n\n307\n00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.970\nSo now instead of a /24,\nwhat do we have here?\n\n308\n00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:22.016\n&gt;&gt; You have a /27.\n\n309\n00:17:22.016 --> 00:17:26.280\n&gt;&gt; So we've now broken the rules.\n\n310\n00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.140\nWe have our variable length subnet mask\nand now we can use it to our advantage.\n\n311\n00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.690\nBecause if you look at the structure\nof this, you think about it.\n\n312\n00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.780\nThis portion right here, and\n\n313\n00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:40.000\nI know I mentioned it, but just I wanted\nto throw a little analogy out there.\n\n314\n00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.020\nThis is kind of like you network portion.\n\n315\n00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.030\nIn order to communicate and\nbe on the same network,\n\n316\n00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.570\nthis portion broken down into\nbinary has to be the same.\n\n317\n00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:54.080\nSo it's kind of like the street name.\n\n318\n00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:59.480\nAnd then this portion, the host portion,\nis unique to that individual host.\n\n319\n00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.015\nSo this is kind of like your house number.\n\n320\n00:18:02.015 --> 00:18:05.620\nSo your neighbors share\nthe network portion.\n\n321\n00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.130\nThat information is the same for\neveryone who lives on the street, but\n\n322\n00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.620\ntheir house numbers change.\n\n323\n00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.870\nAnd the different nodes, the numbers\nchange in this particular portion,\n\n324\n00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:13.992\nin the zeroes portion.\n\n325\n00:18:13.992 --> 00:18:17.560\nAll right, so\nnow we know that we have our /27 and\n\n326\n00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.390\nwe'll go ahead and move forward with that.\n\n327\n00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.070\nI'm gonna borrow this\nlittle chart one more time.\n\n328\n00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.990\nAnd I told you guys it was useful and\nyou'll find that that's very true.\n\n329\n00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:30.280\nSo if I were to take\nthat interesting octet\n\n330\n00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.040\nfrom our variable length\nsubnet mask right here.\n\n331\n00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.380\nSo right now our interesting\noctet is octet number four.\n\n332\n00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:41.280\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and take that, and\nI'm gonna plug it into our equation here.\n\n333\n00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:47.240\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and,\njust put that right here.\n\n334\n00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:55.100\nWe had 1 [COUGH] try to line\nit up a little bit for you.\n\n335\n00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.895\n1, 1 and then the rest were 0s.\n\n336\n00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:08.480\nAll right, so\nthis is somewhat lined up here.\n\n337\n00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.980\nNow this is,\nI told you there was a significance.\n\n338\n00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:19.220\nIt's kind of sad that they say the bit\nwith the, the least significant bit.\n\n339\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.910\nBut I think there is some significance\nhere because this bit is important,\n\n340\n00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.740\nit can help us identify our increment.\n\n341\n00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.140\nSo that least significant bit\nfrom our interesting octet\n\n342\n00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.150\ncan help us find our increment, okay.\n\n343\n00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:33.780\nNow what does that mean, Cherokee?\n\n344\n00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.660\nWell, if I take the original IP address\nthat I had been given to start with,\n\n345\n00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.570\nI'm just gonna move this down here.\n\n346\n00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:43.058\nAnd this is where\nthe practical part comes in.\n\n347\n00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:45.230\nThese are gonna be the numbers\nthat I'm gonna be using for\n\n348\n00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:49.870\nthose five networks to input into\nmy DHCP server for those scopes.\n\n349\n00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.610\nSo now you may be seeing how\nit's all coming together here.\n\n350\n00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.660\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm going to\ntake my original IP address that I was\n\n351\n00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:02.070\ngiven, and notice here that it's got\nmy 0 here, that's what I was given.\n\n352\n00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.800\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nstart and create my ranges.\n\n353\n00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.070\nSo this is kind of a cool concept.\n\n354\n00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.730\nYou take the 0.\n\n355\n00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:12.783\nWe know our increment is 32, so\n0 plus 32 is, this one's I'm not.\n\n356\n00:20:12.783 --> 00:20:14.620\n&gt;&gt; 32?\n&gt;&gt; It's not a trick question.\n\n357\n00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.490\nYeah, it's just really, it's easy,\n\n358\n00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:20.640\nguys, that's why I'm trying\nto make this point here.\n\n359\n00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.000\nSo we add 32, and then 32 plus 32, 64.\n\n360\n00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.657\nAnd we're gonna continue down until,\nnormally if I have five networks\n\n361\n00:20:27.657 --> 00:20:33.530\nI'll go ahead and create six here\njust to give myself an extra one.\n\n362\n00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:35.900\nAnd you'll see why in a second.\n\n363\n00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:41.000\nNow if I take 32 and\nI subtract 1 that gives us 31, right.\n\n364\n00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.550\nNothing too serious here guys.\n\n365\n00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.800\nThen I take 64, subtract 1, gives us 63.\n\n366\n00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.430\n96, subtract 1, gives us 95.\n\n367\n00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:54.650\nAnd then that's gonna be\nthe end portion of my range.\n\n368\n00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.730\nAnd so now you may even,\nI wanna incorporate this term scope.\n\n369\n00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:02.300\nSo my scope could be from here to here,\nbut wait, is that 100% accurate?\n\n370\n00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.060\nRonnie, what do you think?\n\n371\n00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.450\n&gt;&gt; It is accurate.\n\n372\n00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.310\n&gt;&gt; But there is one thing that\nI have to consider when I'm\n\n373\n00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.330\ninputting this into creating my scopes.\n\n374\n00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.060\nAnd that would be my first address for\na network is\n\n375\n00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:21.230\nalways going to be my broadcast address,\nexcuse me, my network ID.\n\n376\n00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:25.730\nMy last address for that scope is always\ngoing to be my broadcast address.\n\n377\n00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:30.260\nSo essentially,\nthe first assignable IP address within\n\n378\n00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:35.430\nthis range is going to be 216.10.1.1,\nall right.\n\n379\n00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:41.170\nThe last assignable address in this\nrange is gonna be 216.10.1.30.\n\n380\n00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.140\nSo hopefully that makes sense to you.\n\n381\n00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:47.927\nAnd although our range, our increment,\nhere was 32, I really only have\n\n382\n00:21:47.927 --> 00:21:53.140\n30 available IP addresses within each\none of these networks to assign.\n\n383\n00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.390\nSo I am limited in that capacity.\n\n384\n00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.610\nNow, sometimes for\nmore complex situations,\n\n385\n00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.670\nyou may be given a requested\nnumber of hosts and\n\n386\n00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.830\na requested number of networks, and\nyou'll have to work things out that way.\n\n387\n00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:08.190\nBut I just kinda wanted to review with\nyou about that fundamental concept,\n\n388\n00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.463\nbecause we are gonna be\ntaking that information and\n\n389\n00:22:10.463 --> 00:22:13.195\nplugging it into servers\nin upcoming shows.\n\n390\n00:22:13.195 --> 00:22:17.470\n&gt;&gt; This also goes into the portion\non the subnet mask as well.\n\n391\n00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.860\nDon't forget that not only do you have\nto be able to break that down, but\n\n392\n00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.850\nremember that your subnet mask will also\nbe different with those extra three bits\n\n393\n00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:29.640\ngiving you a 255.255.255.224 is what\nyou should also end up with there.\n\n394\n00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.433\nSo creating the scope which is\nwhere the practical application and\n\n395\n00:22:33.433 --> 00:22:35.810\nwe're showing you is gonna end up being.\n\n396\n00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:39.568\nBut remembering that the subnet mask\nalso is gonna change is gonna be key.\n\n397\n00:22:39.568 --> 00:22:43.100\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm trying to look at the time here,\n\n398\n00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.200\nI know we've got a few minutes left.\n\n399\n00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.440\nDo you think we have enough\ntime to talk about ports?\n\n400\n00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.120\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n401\n00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:48.780\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n402\n00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.260\n&gt;&gt; So if we take a look at ports,\n\n403\n00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.930\nRonnie, have you ever played\nthis game when you were a kid?\n\n404\n00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.150\nIt's, [LAUGH] he's rolling his eyes at me.\n\n405\n00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:58.058\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to figure out.\n\n406\n00:22:58.058 --> 00:23:00.180\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n407\n00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.190\nIt's the telephone game.\n\n408\n00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:05.740\nAnd you have these two cups or tin cans\nand you tie them together with a string\n\n409\n00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.100\nand then you can communicate in them like,\nhey Ronnie, how is it going?\n\n410\n00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.650\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do remember that.\n\n411\n00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:13.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so for some reason, you guys\nmay think I'm crazy but that's okay,\n\n412\n00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:16.640\nas long as you remember\nI'm cool with that.\n\n413\n00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.490\nLogical endpoints kind of remind\nme of that telephone game for\n\n414\n00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:23.470\nsome reason because it's not something\ntangible, we don't have a cup or\n\n415\n00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.580\na can that we hold and can feel.\n\n416\n00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:30.050\nBut it allows us to communicate with each\nother remotely or across a network or\n\n417\n00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.780\nacross the wire,\nour little string that we had there.\n\n418\n00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:33.300\n&gt;&gt; Agreed.\n\n419\n00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:37.480\n&gt;&gt; All right, so,\nit's very important to know your ports.\n\n420\n00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.620\nI know you guys have probably been\nhounded in A+, Net+, Security+ but\n\n421\n00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.050\nthere's a reason for that.\n\n422\n00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.430\nAnd it's because they're used\nevery day as an administrator.\n\n423\n00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.055\nSo let's see.\n\n424\n00:23:48.055 --> 00:23:51.572\nI've provided some links in the show\nnotes, but I also want to just kind of\n\n425\n00:23:51.572 --> 00:23:55.890\nflick through them real quick and show\nyou on my screen here, if you don't mind.\n\n426\n00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:58.440\nIt's nice that Microsoft does\nprovide some information for you.\n\n427\n00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:03.386\nIf you recall, our well-known ports are\ngoing to be within the range 0 to 1,023.\n\n428\n00:24:03.386 --> 00:24:07.352\nAnd then we have different\ncategorizations,\n\n429\n00:24:07.352 --> 00:24:12.850\nsuch as our registered\nports from 1,024 to 49,151.\n\n430\n00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:17.860\nAnd then we also have all\nthe way up to 65,536, for\n\n431\n00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:22.940\nour ephemeral or our dynamic,\nour changing ports.\n\n432\n00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.290\nSo you don't need to\nmemorize all of those, but\n\n433\n00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:28.780\nwe do need to take a look at\nthe most commonly used ones.\n\n434\n00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.180\nMicrosoft has their list here.\n\n435\n00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.860\nScrolling down,\nyou can just see, some of those.\n\n436\n00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.500\nAnd remember that we do,\nfor instance, here you see,\n\n437\n00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.420\n39 being utilized in both TCP and\nUDP transmissions.\n\n438\n00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.075\nSo just remember about that.\n\n439\n00:24:44.075 --> 00:24:47.010\nIana has an RFC.\n\n440\n00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:48.150\nLet see which RFC is this?\n\n441\n00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:52.990\nThis is going to be, RFC 6335,\n\n442\n00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.100\nwith quite an extensive list.\n\n443\n00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.510\nYou can see all this information here.\n\n444\n00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:01.910\nGood reading for you there, but\n\n445\n00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:04.670\nat least the link's there if\nyou're really interested.\n\n446\n00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:08.050\nI use this particular cheat\nsheet here from packetlife.net.\n\n447\n00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:13.230\nThe information on their site,\nhas been up there for a while.\n\n448\n00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:16.340\nSome of it does not reflect\nthe newer technologies.\n\n449\n00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.480\nBut it's a nice little\nprintable color coded\n\n450\n00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.130\ncheat sheet if you will, so that's cool.\n\n451\n00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:29.820\nAnd what else do we want to say\nabout our particular ports?\n\n452\n00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.710\nI can show you how to look at netstat,\nthat would be good.\n\n453\n00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.070\nLet me go ahead and pull that up here.\n\n454\n00:25:38.035 --> 00:25:40.525\nGive me one second and\nI'll get this machine up.\n\n455\n00:25:40.525 --> 00:25:43.970\nAlright, so let's go ahead and\npull up a machine and\n\n456\n00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.700\nwe'll also, let me see here,\nif I can get connected.\n\n457\n00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.970\nLet me try one more time.\n\n458\n00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.646\nI may have it open in another window.\n\n459\n00:25:51.646 --> 00:25:53.563\nAll right, nope.\n\n460\n00:25:55.795 --> 00:25:56.411\nThere we go.\n\n461\n00:25:56.411 --> 00:25:58.120\nYou can do it.\n\n462\n00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.290\nLet's take a look at PowerShell here.\n\n463\n00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:04.150\nAnd one of the things we can\ndo to identify port numbers,\n\n464\n00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.580\nyou may be familiar with this utility from\nthe Command Prompt within Windows, but\n\n465\n00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:11.660\nyou can also use it within PowerShell and\nthat's gonna be netstat.\n\n466\n00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:17.398\nSo if we go ahead and take a look at,\nnetstat here within PowerShell.\n\n467\n00:26:17.398 --> 00:26:21.013\nWe're still gonna use our dash,\na parameter to go ahead and\n\n468\n00:26:21.013 --> 00:26:22.324\nlook at those ports.\n\n469\n00:26:22.324 --> 00:26:23.884\nBut I can also pipe that out and\n\n470\n00:26:23.884 --> 00:26:27.455\none of the viewers had mentioned\nyesterday about the out gridview.\n\n471\n00:26:27.455 --> 00:26:30.935\nWhich is kind of a cool tool because\nyou can use it in other ways, for\n\n472\n00:26:30.935 --> 00:26:33.625\ndocumentation purposes and\ncopying and pasting.\n\n473\n00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:35.505\nSo that's what we're gonna do here.\n\n474\n00:26:35.505 --> 00:26:39.555\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\npipe that and then type out, O U T,\n\n475\n00:26:39.555 --> 00:26:44.110\nif I can spell grid and\nthen view and then hit enter.\n\n476\n00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.470\nNow what we're looking at here,\n\n477\n00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:52.030\nis going to be a list of those particular\nports, that are being utilized or\n\n478\n00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:54.600\nthe states, it'll also showed\nthe states that they're in.\n\n479\n00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.220\nAnd you can go ahead and scroll down,\nI can zoom in a little bit,\n\n480\n00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.420\nI don't know if you can see that.\n\n481\n00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:05.230\nBut remember, our TCP again is gonna\nbe listed at the top just like\n\n482\n00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.360\nwith our command prompts\nwith that utility,\n\n483\n00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:13.070\nto show those connections on both sides\nthere, there's two logical endpoints.\n\n484\n00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:15.900\nWhereas our UDP towards the bottom,\n\n485\n00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.510\nI'm sure if we just scroll all the way\ndown you can see our UDP connections,\n\n486\n00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:22.260\nreally don't have that\nestablished connection there?\n\n487\n00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.500\nSo you just see the one side there.\n\n488\n00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:29.570\nBut that's one way you can\nidentify port numbers.\n\n489\n00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:33.470\nUsing tools like Wireshark or\nany kind of analytics,\n\n490\n00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:38.340\nwill also give you a great deal of\ninformation just from being able to\n\n491\n00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.320\nrecognize those port\nnumbers pretty quickly.\n\n492\n00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.404\nYou always have the Internet there to\nhelp you out, if you don't know one, but\n\n493\n00:27:44.404 --> 00:27:47.650\nit's just going to make you a little bit\nmore efficient if you can remember those.\n\n494\n00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:51.374\nAnd I think for this show that's\nabout it Ronnie, what do you think?.\n\n495\n00:27:51.374 --> 00:27:55.619\n&gt;&gt; Alright Cherokee, well thank you for\nhelping us on that historical as well as\n\n496\n00:27:55.619 --> 00:27:59.669\nsome of the foundational reviews of\ntechnology and some of the things that\n\n497\n00:27:59.669 --> 00:28:04.320\nserver administrators will have to deal\nwith in terms of networking as well.\n\n498\n00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.260\nThe basic ideas of\nunderstanding subnetting\n\n499\n00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.120\nas well using these port numbers.\n\n500\n00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.220\nThese are all great little utilities and\ntechnologies.\n\n501\n00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:17.710\nThat we really have to have a solid\nbasis in, as we continue to move\n\n502\n00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:21.470\nforward in what we're going to be seeing\nin the next few chapters as well.\n\n503\n00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:24.185\nBut, there's a lot more to go\non some networking fundamentals.\n\n504\n00:28:24.185 --> 00:28:27.590\nSo that means we are headed to a part two.\n\n505\n00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:31.410\nAnd so, it's a great place for\nus to sign off for this episode.\n\n506\n00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.130\nFor ITProTV I've been your host,\nRonnie Wong.\n\n507\n00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:35.079\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n508\n00:28:35.079

00:00:08.420\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.350\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.800\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.730\nYou're watching the Windows Server\n101 show, and I'm your host,\n\n7\n00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.440\nRonnie Wong Today, we're continuing with\na part two on Networking Fundamentals and\n\n8\n00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.587\nhere to guide us through the rest of our\nNetworking Fundamentals is gonna be Ms.\n\n9\n00:00:26.587 --> 00:00:27.290\nCherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.190\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.570\n&gt;&gt; Thank for having me, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.020\nYeah, in the last episode, we took a look\nat different forms of ways we can go\n\n13\n00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.060\nahead and execute subnetting and\nwe talked about logical separation.\n\n14\n00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.000\nIn this show we're gonna talk\na little bit about some ways we can\n\n15\n00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.740\nincrease redundancy.\n\n16\n00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.820\nSo when we're first explaining\nthe difference between server and\n\n17\n00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.775\nclient side systems,\nwe said that servers often include\n\n18\n00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:56.375\nmultiple pieces of hardware\nto help provide stability.\n\n19\n00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:59.085\nProvide that up time that\nwe're really searching for.\n\n20\n00:00:59.085 --> 00:01:03.625\nSo, one thing that you can do is adding\nadditional network interface cards.\n\n21\n00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:07.965\nAnd this is a pretty cool\nconcept because we can utilize,\n\n22\n00:01:07.965 --> 00:01:11.305\nit's called NIC teaming,\nNIC aggregation, NIC bonding.\n\n23\n00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:15.860\nThere are a lot of terms out there but\nI'll get into the specifics in a moment.\n\n24\n00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.530\nWhen we can take this pieces of hardware\nand configure them to work together for\n\n25\n00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.050\na specific purpose.\n\n26\n00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.450\nMy purpose may be for redundancy,\nit may be for increased speed, or\n\n27\n00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.900\nit may be for both.\n\n28\n00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.820\nSo if we take a look at my screen,\n\n29\n00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.600\nI wanna show different types\nof modes that Microsoft.\n\n30\n00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.390\nThey use these terms to help you identify\nthe ways in which you can configure\n\n31\n00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.700\nthese NIC teams.\n\n32\n00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.810\nSo, first, if we take a look\nat switch independent mode,\n\n33\n00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.720\nswitch independent teaming.\n\n34\n00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.060\nI have two switches, so\nby having extra pieces of hardware\n\n35\n00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.840\nI'm further reducing my risk\nof disconnect or failure.\n\n36\n00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.110\nSo, I have two network interface cards,\nso this is a computer if you\n\n37\n00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.080\ncouldn't tell this rectangle\nright here and I can have, so\n\n38\n00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.710\nI have two here in this particular example\nbut the cool thing is server 2016.\n\n39\n00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.900\nI can actually have up to 32\nphysical network interface cards.\n\n40\n00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.410\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n41\n00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and so in Hyper-V when we\nstart using them through the software,\n\n42\n00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.040\nthat's going to be a limitation.\n\n43\n00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.785\nYou can have two but we're not really\nfocusing on Hyper-V at this moment so\n\n44\n00:02:29.785 --> 00:02:31.575\nlet's just think about the concept, right?\n\n45\n00:02:31.575 --> 00:02:35.715\nSo I have multiple, I have two network\ninterface cards here in this machine.\n\n46\n00:02:35.715 --> 00:02:39.376\nAnd when I'm using NIC teaming,\nI want to go ahead and get cards.\n\n47\n00:02:40.807 --> 00:02:45.527\nI would recommend to get the same make\nmanufacturers, speed, the modes to make\n\n48\n00:02:45.527 --> 00:02:50.467\nsure that they're identical as possible so\nthey can work really nice together.\n\n49\n00:02:50.467 --> 00:02:57.331\nBut in this particular team, I can\nconfigure it for redundancy and/or speed.\n\n50\n00:02:57.331 --> 00:03:02.180\nSo in this machine, I can keep\nthem at one gigabit per second or\n\n51\n00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.510\nI can aggregate or bond them and\nincrease the speed.\n\n52\n00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.418\nSo we hear these terms like\nactive active and active passive.\n\n53\n00:03:10.418 --> 00:03:14.690\nIf I kept it separate and\nI didn't increase the speed here and\n\n54\n00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.170\nI just had one gigabit NIC and then one\nkind of sitting there in a standby mode\n\n55\n00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.700\nwaiting to be used if this one were to\nfail, that would be called active passive.\n\n56\n00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.430\nBecause one would be\nan active production use.\n\n57\n00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.790\nAnd whenever, if that one were to fail,\nthen that would go ahead and\n\n58\n00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.790\nkickstart my other NIC to go ahead and\njump in and save the day.\n\n59\n00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:44.110\nSo I'm not fully utilizing this other\nNIC until that event and that failure.\n\n60\n00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.550\nIt creates stability within my network.\n\n61\n00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.120\nSo if there's a particular system or\nreason why you would have to have that\n\n62\n00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.590\nstability there, this would be\na good idea, a good solution.\n\n63\n00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.740\nAnd if a switch were to fail,\nthen the other NIC would go ahead and\n\n64\n00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.790\nkick on that's connected to the other\nswitch, so pretty redundant there.\n\n65\n00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.515\nAnd you don't always have to have two\nseparate switches because you may not be\n\n66\n00:04:07.515 --> 00:04:09.988\nable to afford it or\nwhatever the situation may be.\n\n67\n00:04:09.988 --> 00:04:13.372\nSo if you look at\nSwitch-Dependent Teaming,\n\n68\n00:04:13.372 --> 00:04:18.750\nyou can also utilize the concept where\nwe can setup NIC teams to go ahead and\n\n69\n00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.327\nagain have that active\npassive configuration.\n\n70\n00:04:22.327 --> 00:04:25.558\nOr we can go ahead and\nhave them both actively running and\n\n71\n00:04:25.558 --> 00:04:30.440\nwe would get two gigs per second here\nif these were both one gig cards.\n\n72\n00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.660\nAnd in the event of a failure,\nthis situation over here on the left,\n\n73\n00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.400\nthen my speed would drop down to one gig,\nbut I wouldn't be dead in the water.\n\n74\n00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.510\nSo, I do have some\nredundancies with this design.\n\n75\n00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.600\nA switch dependent,\nI am dependent on that particular switch.\n\n76\n00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.090\nIf it were to fail, that would be\nmy single point of failure there.\n\n77\n00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.010\nSo just knowing the layout will then help\nyou decide which way you want to go when\n\n78\n00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.480\nyou're actually setting one up and\nconfiguring one.\n\n79\n00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.460\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look in PowerShell and\n\n80\n00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.360\nshow you how we can actually\nset one of these up.\n\n81\n00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.901\nSo let me just bring that up for us.\n\n82\n00:05:13.083 --> 00:05:16.363\nAnd I'll change the font so\nwe can see what's happening here.\n\n83\n00:05:20.109 --> 00:05:23.530\nAll right, so the particular command\nthat we're going to be using.\n\n84\n00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.530\nActually, let's first just see what's\ninstalled on this machine, and\n\n85\n00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.180\nit may help give us an idea of\nwhat our available options are for\n\n86\n00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.470\nthose network adapter cards, because I\nhave to have them physically in my machine\n\n87\n00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.510\nin order to be able to go ahead,\nand aggregate, and bond them.\n\n88\n00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.280\nSo if we just type in GET-, and\nthis is going to be nETaDapter.\n\n89\n00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.440\nOops and my cap locks was on,\nI hate when that I happens.\n\n90\n00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.581\nLike I said it doesn't matter for\nthe outcome, but\n\n91\n00:05:49.581 --> 00:05:52.000\nI just want you guys to see it properly.\n\n92\n00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.282\nNet adapter, sorry, slow down.\n\n93\n00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:05.000\nSo, we can see the different adapters that\nare already installed on this system.\n\n94\n00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.750\nI scroll over and I can see that I\ndo have available adapters here.\n\n95\n00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.320\nGive me one second.\n\n96\n00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.610\nAnd you can see their speed.\n\n97\n00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.610\nSo, the ones that I'm going to select for\nmy particular team,\n\n98\n00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.070\nI'm going to choose Ethernet1\nup here on the top and\n\n99\n00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.220\nEthernet2 and I made my font\na little bit too large here but\n\n100\n00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.620\nscrolling over, we can see that they're\nboth here at 1 gigabit per second.\n\n101\n00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.060\nSo, we'll take a look at how we can\ngo ahead and configure those now.\n\n102\n00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.840\nThe command that we're going to\nbe using is going to be set or\n\n103\n00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.230\nexcuse me, new net LBFO team.\n\n104\n00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:50.070\nSo, we'll go ahead and\ntype that in and this\n\n105\n00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.610\none here I may use my tab key.\n\n106\n00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.948\nSo you guys don't have to see me.\n\n107\n00:06:59.948 --> 00:07:01.490\nThere we go.\n\n108\n00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.764\nSo my -NetLbfoTeam, and then space, -Name.\n\n109\n00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.670\nAnd you can name this\nwhatever you would like to.\n\n110\n00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.360\nI'm just going to go ahead and\nselect Team1 for now, and\n\n111\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.020\nthen we're going to go ahead and\nspecify our team members.\n\n112\n00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.250\nLet me scroll over a little bit,\nso you can see where we are.\n\n113\n00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.149\nSo my team members.\n\n114\n00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:32.400\nNow, this is where you gonna fill in\nwhatever adapters you chose to use.\n\n115\n00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.400\nSo the adapters I told you I wanted\nto use are going to be Ethernet1,\n\n116\n00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.770\ncomma and\nthen we're also gonna use Ethernet2.\n\n117\n00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.972\nI think there's a space after\nthe comma but we'll find out.\n\n118\n00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.236\nAll right, now there is\na parameter that you can add and\n\n119\n00:07:53.236 --> 00:07:56.750\nit's in the notes to\nautomatically confirm.\n\n120\n00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.320\nBut I'm not gonna use that right now\nI'm just gonna run this command so\n\n121\n00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.600\nthat it'll manually ask me, are you\nsure you wanna perform this action?\n\n122\n00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.500\nIf you're really confident in your\ncommands and you've been working with\n\n123\n00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.300\nPowerShell for awhile then you can\ngo ahead and bypass that, but for\n\n124\n00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.910\nnow we'll just go ahead and you have\nthe ability to say yes, yes to all.\n\n125\n00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:22.250\nI'm going to ahead and say yes and\nhit enter and I get an output and\n\n126\n00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:26.180\nit shows me the name of this particular\nteam that I've just created, Team1.\n\n127\n00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:31.340\nIt shows me the adapters that have been\ncreated here, Ethernet2 and Ethernet 1.\n\n128\n00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.530\nAnd here we see our teaming\nmode is switch independent.\n\n129\n00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.640\nSo that would be on that diagram,\nwe looked at the one to the right there.\n\n130\n00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.510\nOne thing though,\nwhen you first just set it up like this,\n\n131\n00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:49.570\nboth of those adaptors are gonna be\nan inactive active configuration.\n\n132\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.410\nSo, let's say I wanted to go ahead and\nchange that and\n\n133\n00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.480\nset it to an active passive and\n\n134\n00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.300\nput one in standby mode, we would need\nto go ahead and take an extra step here.\n\n135\n00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.688\nSo, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n136\n00:09:00.688 --> 00:09:06.652\nSo let's hit Set- and\nthis is going to be NetLbfo,\n\n137\n00:09:06.652 --> 00:09:13.450\nand let's Tab through that and\nthis is gonna be LbfoTeam,\n\n138\n00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:18.740\nit's actually just Team, and then Member.\n\n139\n00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.890\nWe'll specify the name.\n\n140\n00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.511\nAnd for this one, I'll go ahead and\nselect Ethernet2.\n\n141\n00:09:29.373 --> 00:09:31.417\nLet's scroll over, so we can see that.\n\n142\n00:09:36.362 --> 00:09:41.036\nAnd for the mode here, we're gonna go\nahead and type in administrative mode and\n\n143\n00:09:41.036 --> 00:09:42.729\nthen specify stand by here.\n\n144\n00:09:42.729 --> 00:09:52.470\nSo -AdministrativeMode,\nStandby and there you go.\n\n145\n00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:59.960\nIf I spelt that Set-NetLbfo of course\nI have a typo here, let's see.\n\n146\n00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:07.493\nNetLbfo space TeamMember,\nis not recognized check your spelling.\n\n147\n00:10:07.493 --> 00:10:11.383\nLet me actually just reduce my font\na little bit it's a little too large.\n\n148\n00:10:14.987 --> 00:10:16.323\nSee if that helps.\n\n149\n00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:30.670\nSet, dash, okay.\n\n150\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:31.990\nI don't think it's a space there.\n\n151\n00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.602\nSorry about that.\n\n152\n00:10:32.602 --> 00:10:35.515\nI think this is all one cmndlet.\n\n153\n00:10:35.515 --> 00:10:38.905\nAnd you'll see it turned yellow and\nthen that should be good to go.\n\n154\n00:10:38.905 --> 00:10:39.650\nAll right.\n\n155\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:44.359\nSo, now we've essentially just put\nthat into active passive mode.\n\n156\n00:10:44.359 --> 00:10:47.507\nWe didn't really get a lot of\nnotification or anything that came up, so\n\n157\n00:10:47.507 --> 00:10:49.615\nthere is a way you can go ahead and\ncheck on that.\n\n158\n00:10:49.615 --> 00:10:53.559\nSo, what we're going to do now is\nverify that we're in standby mode for\n\n159\n00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:55.283\nethernet adapter number two.\n\n160\n00:10:55.283 --> 00:11:00.477\nSo, what we're going to\ndo is type in Get- and\n\n161\n00:11:00.477 --> 00:11:07.421\nthis one is NetLbfo, and\nthe team member, so this is all one.\n\n162\n00:11:07.421 --> 00:11:11.152\nDon't make the same mistake\nthat I made there, TeamMember.\n\n163\n00:11:13.413 --> 00:11:17.067\nAnd then, for this one,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n164\n00:11:17.067 --> 00:11:20.550\nspecify the name, and\nthat is our Ethernet2.\n\n165\n00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.520\nAnd then hit enter.\n\n166\n00:11:25.495 --> 00:11:28.993\nWhat happened here ethernet2.\n\n167\n00:11:28.993 --> 00:11:29.878\nI didn't put name.\n\n168\n00:11:29.878 --> 00:11:30.800\nSorry about that.\n\n169\n00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.300\nDid I?\n\n170\n00:11:32.355 --> 00:11:37.780\nNope, you have to specify\nthe name -name ethernet2.\n\n171\n00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:42.126\nSpace, Ethernet2.\n\n172\n00:11:42.126 --> 00:11:44.210\nNow Enter, all right.\n\n173\n00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:49.200\nNow, you can see that we are currently\nchose you that the Administrative mode is\n\n174\n00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.600\nin standby mode for Ethernet number two.\n\n175\n00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.120\nSo although we didn't\nget it a really obvious\n\n176\n00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.870\nnotification there that is set to\nthat particular configuration and.\n\n177\n00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.660\nFor creating a team that's\nessentially it for now.\n\n178\n00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.250\nNow like I said hyper V is a little\ndifferent you have to go through\n\n179\n00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.650\nthe software interface and\ngo ahead and configure those.\n\n180\n00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:13.020\nBut that's it for NIC teaming.\n\n181\n00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.890\n&gt;&gt; All right so\nnow that we understand the basic here,\n\n182\n00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:21.010\nidea that we are providing redundancy\njust in case one device fails or.\n\n183\n00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:26.250\nOr we can even do the independent\nwhere we have two of switches while\n\n184\n00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.360\nwhere of one NIC and one switch fails,\nwe still have the connectivity.\n\n185\n00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.810\nWe can also talk about a little bit\nmore on the security side of this.\n\n186\n00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:40.060\nSo, Cherokee, what do we need to know when\nwe start talking around the basics here\n\n187\n00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.450\nfor a Windows server on the security\nside of the networking?\n\n188\n00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:44.970\n&gt;&gt; There is so much to learn Ronnie.\n\n189\n00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.890\nWe have entire courses that focus\non security, network security.\n\n190\n00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.880\nWhen you look at your\nindividual devices and\n\n191\n00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.220\nyour hardening servers,\nI think a good place to start would be.\n\n192\n00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.560\nIf we take a look at my screen here,\n\n193\n00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.100\nI have a link that I provided in\nthe notes and it comes from OWASP,\n\n194\n00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:08.220\nOpen Web Applications Security Project\nwhich offers up some guidelines and\n\n195\n00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:13.870\nit's really defines server security,\n\n196\n00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:18.050\nand they talk a lot about here\ntransport layer protection.\n\n197\n00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:21.710\nIn the book Brian mentions SSL versus TLS,\nso\n\n198\n00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:25.290\nwe'll talk about that for a moment but\nthere's just really so much.\n\n199\n00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:29.470\nIt's impossible to cover\nin this particular show but\n\n200\n00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.130\nlike I said we have\ncourses devoted to that.\n\n201\n00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:36.960\nNow, we did mention protocols\nin the previous episode.\n\n202\n00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.740\nSo I'd like you to also\nkeep that in mind and\n\n203\n00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.740\nbring that in because it is\nimportant to harden your systems.\n\n204\n00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.310\nTo close any kind of unopen ports,\n\n205\n00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:49.662\nremove any software that's not needed.\n\n206\n00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:52.440\nKind of how we had been looking when\nwe were looking at our rules and\n\n207\n00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.710\nfeatures, using features on demand.\n\n208\n00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:56.510\nWe wanna go ahead.\n\n209\n00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.260\nWe had the ability to\nrestrict access through\n\n210\n00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.140\nour Internet Explorer interface there.\n\n211\n00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.690\nYou saw how we can go ahead and\nconfigure that.\n\n212\n00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:04.630\nWhat else can we do?\n\n213\n00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.040\nMake sure we keep our systems up to date.\n\n214\n00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.320\nHave good patch management strategies.\n\n215\n00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.960\nSo, there are a lot of different things.\n\n216\n00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.270\nIt's not just one thing that we\ncan do to make our systems secure.\n\n217\n00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:19.970\nBut when we talk about SSL versus TLS and\n\n218\n00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:23.260\nyou're asked to go ahead and\nconfigure certain things it's important to\n\n219\n00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.460\nunderstand why we would\nchoose one versus the other.\n\n220\n00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.210\nAnd even looking at our different\nprotocols it's important to know why we\n\n221\n00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.130\nwould choose one versus the other or\n\n222\n00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.760\nwhat can we do to make\nan unsecure protocol secure.\n\n223\n00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.610\nBy adding them together in\na protocol suite if you look at\n\n224\n00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:41.970\ntunneling protocol L2TP.\n\n225\n00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.000\nYou take that by itself that\ntunneling protocol is not secure but\n\n226\n00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.480\nthen when you go ahead and\nutilize it with something like IPsec,\n\n227\n00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.650\nthen that will allow you an encrypted\ntunnel to go ahead and communicate.\n\n228\n00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:59.780\nSo, really setting your ports,\nbrushing up on your port numbers,\n\n229\n00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.850\nand then just keeping\nthose systems hardened.\n\n230\n00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:09.240\nBecause if we talk about SSL and TLS, and\nI say that because it's used as a base for\n\n231\n00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:15.810\nPKI within the Internet and\nwe have seen various iterations over time.\n\n232\n00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.280\nWas it SSL originally by Netscape?\n\n233\n00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:23.070\nAnd over the years, we've progressed into\nTLS and a lot of times you'll hear people\n\n234\n00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:29.420\nsay if they are talking about HTTPS,\nthey may say it's HTPP with SSL.\n\n235\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:35.236\nBut nowadays it's most likely going to\nbe HTTP bundled or coupled with TLS.\n\n236\n00:15:35.236 --> 00:15:38.920\nThe current version that we have\nout there is gonna be TLS1.3.\n\n237\n00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:45.150\nThere are subsequent versions that your\nsystems can be backwards compatible with,\n\n238\n00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.830\nbut just keep in mind\nthat if you go ahead,\n\n239\n00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:51.230\nit may seem like one little tiny\nconfiguration option that you're checking.\n\n240\n00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.709\nYeah I'll be backwards compatible\nwith the SSL version whatever.\n\n241\n00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.520\nKeep that in mind you're reducing\nthe overall security for that particular\n\n242\n00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.260\nsystem, for that particular network\njust by making that one little decision.\n\n243\n00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:07.580\nSo, I guess when it comes to security,\n\n244\n00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:12.510\ntransport layer security,\nany kind of security really I would highly\n\n245\n00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.180\nrecommend taking some time if that's\nsomething you're interested in and\n\n246\n00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.030\nit's not something that's just\ngonna be easy to understand.\n\n247\n00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:22.140\nSecurity is not for the faint of heart but\nwe do have tons of shows on that and\n\n248\n00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.580\nI would just urge you to go ahead and\ntake a look.\n\n249\n00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.570\nI mean, we've got CEH,\nwe've got all sort of shows,\n\n250\n00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:29.550\nwe've got our Security+,\nquite a few in there.\n\n251\n00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the other thing that we\nmay think about in terms of network\n\n252\n00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:36.600\ncommunication and securing that is\nalso things like VPN tunnels and\n\n253\n00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.440\nsome of the different technology\nthat's involved there too.\n\n254\n00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.780\nThe great thing is Windows Server normally\ndoes give you that ability to configure\n\n255\n00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:47.190\nnot only things like what Cherokee was\ntalking about but also that ability to\n\n256\n00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:51.460\ncreate those types of tunneling protocols\nthat are normally secured as well for\n\n257\n00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.510\nthat type of traffic that we have.\n\n258\n00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:54.490\nAll right, so Cherokee,\n\n259\n00:16:54.490 --> 00:17:00.730\nif that pretty much covers it that's gonna\nend our particular episode for today.\n\n260\n00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.500\nRemember that what you saw here, right,\n\n261\n00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:08.080\nis that Cherokee showed us how we can\nconfigure NIC teaming to provide a basis,\n\n262\n00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.070\nright, of either being able to do\nload balancing across those NICs or\n\n263\n00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:17.810\nbeing able to provide redundancy in\ncase of one NIC and switch failing.\n\n264\n00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.160\nAs well as talking about some of these\ndifferent protocols that we tend to see\n\n265\n00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.490\nthat we have to secure the communication\nbetween our server and some place else.\n\n266\n00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:28.170\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n267\n00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:31.870\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n268\n00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:32.880\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n269\n00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.385\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of Windows Server 101 shows.\n\n270\n00:17:37.385 --> 00:17:43.229\n[MUSIC]\n\n271\n00:17:43.229 -->

She explains each step and the shows the end result of the setup.  She explains that even though configured, it may not be ready for use until the server is authorized in your domain environment.  She discusses with Ronnie the use of dynamic IPs and configures reserved IPs within the DHCP scope.  Lastly, she shows how to backup and restore the DHCP database through the GUI.",

00:00:08.939\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.776\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.776 --> 00:00:18.630\nYou're watching\nthe Windows Server 101 show.\n\n6\n00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.530\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n7\n00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.350\ntoday we'll be taking a look at\nmanaging a DHCP server role.\n\n8\n00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.483\nAnd here to help us get started with\nthat is gonna be Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:28.483 --> 00:00:30.050\nCherokee, welcome back to the studios.\n\n10\n00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.890\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me today, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.855\nYeah, so we're gonna be talking about\nDHCP, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.\n\n12\n00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:41.643\nAnd although the name says dynamic in it,\nwe can also think\n\n13\n00:00:41.643 --> 00:00:46.740\nabout DHCP utilizing static IP\naddresses and reservations.\n\n14\n00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.320\nAnd so\nwe'll take a look at that idea as well.\n\n15\n00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.430\nSo if we think about DHCP,\nwell, what is it, right?\n\n16\n00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.090\nDHCP is a service within our\nnetworks that can provide addresses.\n\n17\n00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.620\nSo in a previous show I\nshowed you how to subnet and\n\n18\n00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.280\nwe created different networks and\nwe were looking for those networks ranges.\n\n19\n00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.561\nHere I can take those numbers,\nthe output from that math, and\n\n20\n00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:13.390\nthen I can plug it into\nwhat are called scopes.\n\n21\n00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.250\nSo a scope is going to be\nan address pool that I can use to\n\n22\n00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.570\nassign to individuals systems,\nor printers,\n\n23\n00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.894\nor whatever,\non my network within that scope.\n\n24\n00:01:26.894 --> 00:01:30.010\nWe're gonna look at how to go ahead and\ncreate that.\n\n25\n00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.980\nBut let's think about any exclusions or\nreservations that we may want to add.\n\n26\n00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.200\nBecause if we talk about workstations,\nRonnie, and\n\n27\n00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.140\nwe look at the average lease\nduration is eight days.\n\n28\n00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.510\nWhich should give us enough time\nif someone's out of the office,\n\n29\n00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.910\nthey go on vacation,\nthat lease may expire.\n\n30\n00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.840\nBecause we're not obtaining\npermanent IP addresses all the time,\n\n31\n00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.720\nwe're sharing them with others\nwithin that particular scope.\n\n32\n00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.720\nSo when would we want to go ahead and\ncreate a static IP address so that if\n\n33\n00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.790\nI go on vacation, I come back on, I get\na new address, but what about the printer?\n\n34\n00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.620\nThe printer doesn't go on vacation,\nand everyone uses the printer, so\n\n35\n00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.492\nthey want to know that IP address.\n\n36\n00:02:09.492 --> 00:02:13.250\nSo we'll also take a look at that and\nhow to actually configure it.\n\n37\n00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.120\nA couple things first, when we walked\nthrough setting up the DHCP role with\n\n38\n00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.990\nour Add Roles and Features wizard, and\nI said that you always needed to have\n\n39\n00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.820\nat least one static IP address on\nthe machine that was hosting that role.\n\n40\n00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.120\nReason being the other machines still do\nneed to know how to communicate with it.\n\n41\n00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.780\nBut if you think about\nthe DHCP process in general,\n\n42\n00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.090\nwe're really starting at layer two there,\nright?\n\n43\n00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.198\nSo if we take a look at my screen,\nI do wanna just remind you of this little\n\n44\n00:02:43.198 --> 00:02:49.011\nDora process down here, the Discover,\nOffer, Request and Acknowledgement.\n\n45\n00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:53.547\nAnd if you think about the Discover frame,\nthat original communication,\n\n46\n00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:56.470\nthat broadcast that's being sent out.\n\n47\n00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.015\nAnd then the DHCP server, since\nthey're Offer packet and then you get\n\n48\n00:03:00.015 --> 00:03:04.483\nthe Request and then the Acknowledgement,\nand you see that communication happening.\n\n49\n00:03:04.483 --> 00:03:08.240\nSo we need to at least be able\nto have that information there.\n\n50\n00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.360\nSo let's go ahead and get started here and\ncreate a particular scope.\n\n51\n00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.370\nNow, this system already\nhad DHCP installed.\n\n52\n00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.915\nIf you don't, you'll need to go back and\nwatch that show and just\n\n53\n00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:25.304\nwalk through the wizard or use PowerShell\nto go ahead and install that DHCP role.\n\n54\n00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:29.743\nFrom the top right-hand portion, and you\ncan see even over on the left-hand side\n\n55\n00:03:29.743 --> 00:03:33.151\nthat DHCP is installed here, but\nwe're just gonna go ahead and\n\n56\n00:03:33.151 --> 00:03:36.720\nuse the drop-down menu and\npull up our DHCP management console.\n\n57\n00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.250\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n58\n00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.840\nexpand this out, give myself a little bit\nof room to see what I'm working with here.\n\n59\n00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.212\nYou may choose to do the same.\n\n60\n00:03:45.212 --> 00:03:51.010\nAnd I can see my particular DHCP server\nhere over on the side, and expand it out.\n\n61\n00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.741\nNow, you'll notice that I have\nthe ability to configure IPv4 and\n\n62\n00:03:54.741 --> 00:03:58.749\nIPv6 addresses all within one utility\nhere, so that's kind of cool.\n\n63\n00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:02.300\nI'm only focusing on IPv4 for\nthis particular demonstration.\n\n64\n00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.280\nSo what we're gonna go ahead and do here\nis, notice how, I guess if I zoom in,\n\n65\n00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.980\nyou can see that there's\na little blue exclamation point.\n\n66\n00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.920\nMy current scope is down,\nit's not authorized yet, it's not running.\n\n67\n00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.450\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\ncreate a new scope here.\n\n68\n00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.399\nSo if you just right-click on top\nof that and then select New Scope,\n\n69\n00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:25.118\nit'll go ahead and\nbring up the wizard for us.\n\n70\n00:04:25.118 --> 00:04:27.372\nSo let's say I have a particular range,\n\n71\n00:04:27.372 --> 00:04:31.880\nlike one of those networks that we looked\nat in a previous episode, in my mind.\n\n72\n00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.380\nAnd say, hey, I wanna go ahead and create\nthis network, this scope if you will, but\n\n73\n00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.000\nthere are couple of printers that\nI wanna go ahead and reserve.\n\n74\n00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.310\nLet's start at the beginning here.\n\n75\n00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.084\nSo this is just the welcome page,\nwe'll go ahead and hit Next.\n\n76\n00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:49.715\nAnd maybe this particular network or\nthis scope is going to be for\n\n77\n00:04:49.715 --> 00:04:51.359\nmy sales department.\n\n78\n00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:57.001\nSo I'll just go ahead and type in Sales,\nand then maybe put in Sales,\n\n79\n00:04:57.001 --> 00:05:03.154\nand then I might even add maybe Florida\nSales Group or something like that.\n\n80\n00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:10.770\nAnd then hit Next.\n\n81\n00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.006\nNow, for this particular portion\nyou do have to coincide with\n\n82\n00:05:16.006 --> 00:05:19.459\nthe networking scheme that\nyou've already been getting.\n\n83\n00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:24.847\nSo here I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo 192.168, and just by following along,\n\n84\n00:05:24.847 --> 00:05:29.539\nyou have all of these steps listed\nin the book that Brian has provided.\n\n85\n00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.295\nSo we'll go ahead and kind of keep\nin line with what he's showing, so\n\n86\n00:05:32.295 --> 00:05:34.940\nthat if you choose to do this on your own,\nthat's fine.\n\n87\n00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.348\nYou guys also have access\nto these practice labs, and\n\n88\n00:05:37.348 --> 00:05:40.840\nI highly encourage you to go ahead and\nget in there and play around with those.\n\n89\n00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.380\nFor this particular one we're gonna\ngo ahead and set this as .1.101.\n\n90\n00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.110\nAnd you have to have an end in sight here.\n\n91\n00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.872\nYou have to have a beginning and\nend IP address for this particular range.\n\n92\n00:05:53.872 --> 00:05:59.409\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ntype in 192.168.1,\n\n93\n00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.990\nwe'll just say here 200.\n\n94\n00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.140\nAnd you can see your subnet mask\ninformation down here at the bottom.\n\n95\n00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.138\nWe're gonna be working with 100 different\nIP addresses here within this pool, and\n\n96\n00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:13.683\nwe'll go ahead and select Next.\n\n97\n00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.500\nNow, this is where you can\nadd any kind of exclusions.\n\n98\n00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.300\nSo let's say there was a particular\nrange within that scope, and\n\n99\n00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.280\nI said maybe I have, I don't know,\nfive printers or something like that.\n\n100\n00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.789\nAnd I wanna go ahead and\nreserve those IP addresses or\n\n101\n00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.849\nexclude them from this particular scope.\n\n102\n00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:34.283\nOr maybe there's just some reason\nI don't wanna use that address,\n\n103\n00:06:34.283 --> 00:06:35.700\nwhatever that reason may be.\n\n104\n00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:41.189\nSo I could go ahead and say 192.168.\n\n105\n00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:44.180\nWe'll just go ahead and\nput in one exclusion here.\n\n106\n00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.780\nAnd we'll just use the first one .101.\n\n107\n00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.087\nAnd then well, .168.1.101,\n\n108\n00:06:52.087 --> 00:06:55.732\nand go ahead and select Add.\n\n109\n00:06:55.732 --> 00:06:58.880\nAnd then you also have the option\nto ahead and delay in milliseconds.\n\n110\n00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.820\nBut we're just gonna keep it like this and\nhit Next.\n\n111\n00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.270\nNow, this is where,\nI don't know if you can see this,\n\n112\n00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.000\nbut there is a number eight here in this\ndefault option for the lease duration.\n\n113\n00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.096\nSo let's talk about that for a moment.\n\n114\n00:07:15.096 --> 00:07:20.014\nWhen I'm calling out that little\nDora process to the DHCP server and\n\n115\n00:07:20.014 --> 00:07:23.570\nI accept that offer,\nI send my acknowledgment.\n\n116\n00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.410\nThat's my IP address, right?\n\n117\n00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.070\nFor at least eight days.\n\n118\n00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.800\nIf I wanna go ahead and extend that lease,\nI have an option to do so.\n\n119\n00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.500\nSo, there's a process that happens.\n\n120\n00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:41.442\nYou'll approach a 50% timer, so\nday four, what's known as a T1 timer...\n\n121\n00:07:41.442 --> 00:07:45.960\nWhere the DHCP server tries to initiate\ncommunication with that particular node\n\n122\n00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.160\nto say, hey, do you wanna go ahead and\nkeep this IP address and extend it?\n\n123\n00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.695\nWell, what if, day four,\nI'm still on my vacation, and\n\n124\n00:07:52.695 --> 00:07:55.522\nI don't respond to that\nDHCP communication?\n\n125\n00:07:55.522 --> 00:07:59.125\nWell, that DHCP server will then again,\nat a later time,\n\n126\n00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:01.345\ncreate what's called a T2 timer.\n\n127\n00:08:01.345 --> 00:08:05.491\nAnd that's gonna be at 87.5% of\nthat lease duration to still,\n\n128\n00:08:05.491 --> 00:08:09.579\nif you're interested, And\nretaining that particular address.\n\n129\n00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:14.230\nIf that DHCP server does not hear back\nfrom that node by the time it has fully\n\n130\n00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.249\nreached its pre-determined lease duration.\n\n131\n00:08:17.249 --> 00:08:20.369\nThen it'll go ahead and\ntake the IP address back,\n\n132\n00:08:20.369 --> 00:08:23.713\nput it back into the pool\nof available addresses, and\n\n133\n00:08:23.713 --> 00:08:28.300\npotentially assign it to another\nnode within that network.\n\n134\n00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.413\nSo anytime you receive an address of\n\n135\n00:08:31.413 --> 00:08:36.711\n169.254.whatever within\nthat particular range,\n\n136\n00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:42.546\nthat means you're not able to\ncommunicate with that DHCP server.\n\n137\n00:08:42.546 --> 00:08:47.840\nAnd Windows will provide you with an APIPA\naddress, an automatic IP address.\n\n138\n00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.741\nIn other operating systems they call\nit something different like a link\n\n139\n00:08:50.741 --> 00:08:51.428\nlocal address.\n\n140\n00:08:51.428 --> 00:08:55.956\nBut essentially, what that does for\nyou it's kind of like a little crutch it\n\n141\n00:08:55.956 --> 00:09:00.180\nwill allow you to communicate\nwith others within your network.\n\n142\n00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.614\nYou won't be able to traverse your\nnetwork and go through a router,\n\n143\n00:09:03.614 --> 00:09:05.732\nspeak to anyone outside of your network.\n\n144\n00:09:05.732 --> 00:09:11.200\nBut it'll still get you going along\nthere and let you limp on your way.\n\n145\n00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.170\nSo we're just going to leave\nthis at our default here for\n\n146\n00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:17.050\nthis particular lease duration,\nand then go ahead and hit Next.\n\n147\n00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:22.190\nAll right, let's talk about scope options.\n\n148\n00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.824\nOn this screen,\nthey're giving me the options, say, hey,\n\n149\n00:09:24.824 --> 00:09:26.815\ndo you want to go ahead and\nconfigure that now?\n\n150\n00:09:26.815 --> 00:09:30.080\nOr do you want to go ahead and\nconfigure it later?\n\n151\n00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.940\nThere are a lot of different things that\nI can add, components that I can add.\n\n152\n00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.890\nIf you think about what DHCP provides to\nthe clients, let's think about that for\n\n153\n00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.030\na second.\n\n154\n00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.290\nNumber one, the IP address,\nlike I just mentioned to you.\n\n155\n00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:44.788\nNumber two, the subnet masks so\n\n156\n00:09:44.788 --> 00:09:47.350\nthat it can communicate with\neveryone on the network.\n\n157\n00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.659\nAnd the third most common thing\nthat DHCP will provide for\n\n158\n00:09:51.659 --> 00:09:55.170\nclient will be the default\ngateway address.\n\n159\n00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:59.250\nSo your default gateway will\nallow you to leave your network,\n\n160\n00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.070\nwill allow you to go through\nthat gateway router.\n\n161\n00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.450\nIt's not a necessity.\n\n162\n00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.450\nYou can still communicate,\nlocally, on your subnet,\n\n163\n00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.920\nwithout a default gateway router address.\n\n164\n00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.510\nBut just keep that in mind,\nbecause when you go and check,\n\n165\n00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:18.760\nunder your IP configurations, someone may,\naccidentally, have typed that in wrong.\n\n166\n00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.290\nSo when you're going through\nyour troubleshooting\n\n167\n00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.610\nprocess you have to logically think\nabout okay, who can I communicate with?\n\n168\n00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.380\nWho can I not communicate with?\n\n169\n00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.490\nWhat could potentially\nbe the problem there?\n\n170\n00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:31.900\nCheck those three things first, but\njust know that DHCP can offer so\n\n171\n00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.800\nmuch more than that.\n\n172\n00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.200\nThere are a ton of options.\n\n173\n00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.420\nAnd even with Server 2016\nMicrosoft has released and\n\n174\n00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.660\nexpanded upon those options\nthat it can provide you.\n\n175\n00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.910\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nclick Yes now so\n\n176\n00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.190\nthat you can see what\noptions are available.\n\n177\n00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.100\nThe first one is, it says,\n\n178\n00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:53.640\nto add an IP address here for a router\nused by a clients enter the address below.\n\n179\n00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.550\nThis is what I was talking\nabout with our default gateway.\n\n180\n00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:05.298\nSo for the particular one right here\nwe'll just go ahead and [COUGH] 192.168.\n\n181\n00:11:05.298 --> 00:11:11.140\nLet's say .0.1 for\nthis particular router address.\n\n182\n00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.830\nYou can hit Add and then select Next.\n\n183\n00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:19.440\nAnd you will also see these little\noptions here, up and down options.\n\n184\n00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.048\nYou can add additional components here for\nredundancy.\n\n185\n00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:26.489\nAnd then by selecting up or\ndown you're selecting the priority for\n\n186\n00:11:26.489 --> 00:11:28.720\nthose particular IP addresses.\n\n187\n00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.170\nYou could also do that with DNS servers.\n\n188\n00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:39.080\nSo it's recommended to have at least two\nDNS servers within your environment for\n\n189\n00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.510\nthat exact reason.\n\n190\n00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:45.650\nSo if you are running, let's say,\non this machine, I decide that I also\n\n191\n00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:50.640\nwant DNS to be running on this machine\nthat is offering DHCP, that's fine.\n\n192\n00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.724\nBut you should probably have another DNS,\na dedicated DNS server there,\n\n193\n00:11:55.724 --> 00:12:00.562\nor maybe shared with other roles or\nservices that you want for backup.\n\n194\n00:12:00.562 --> 00:12:03.580\nSo we don't have to put anything here for\nnow.\n\n195\n00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.150\nYou can see that my current IP\naddress is already listed here.\n\n196\n00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.834\nBut if I wanted to, I could add\nadditional IP addresses right here.\n\n197\n00:12:10.834 --> 00:12:13.608\nAnd I again would have\nthat prioritization,\n\n198\n00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:17.770\nthat priority in the order of\nprecedence there to move it up or down.\n\n199\n00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.873\nAnd then I go ahead and select Next.\n\n200\n00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:23.663\nNow when we talk about WINS servers,\n\n201\n00:12:23.663 --> 00:12:28.730\nWINS servers is an alternative\nnaming convention to DNS.\n\n202\n00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.090\nIt is quite old.\n\n203\n00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.952\nRonnie, do you know of any systems or\nnetworks that may be using WINS or\n\n204\n00:12:32.952 --> 00:12:34.467\nthat you've worked with recently?\n\n205\n00:12:34.467 --> 00:12:38.288\n&gt;&gt; Not in the last 15 years,\nyeah I don't think so.\n\n206\n00:12:38.288 --> 00:12:42.369\n&gt;&gt; All right so most commonly you're not\ngonna be inputting anything here, but\n\n207\n00:12:42.369 --> 00:12:45.884\nif you are I'm sure someone in your\nnetwork will have already given\n\n208\n00:12:45.884 --> 00:12:48.890\nyou the heads up as to why you\nwould be working with WINS.\n\n209\n00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.050\nSo we'll just go ahead and\nskip that for now.\n\n210\n00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:53.730\nAnd then this is kind of cool.\n\n211\n00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.800\nIt ask you, hey do you wanna go ahead and\nactivate this scope now?\n\n212\n00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.340\nYes, we'll go ahead and activate it.\n\n213\n00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.790\nBut that's not the only\nthing that we need to do.\n\n214\n00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:07.102\nIn addition to activating the scope,\nwe also mean to authorize our DHCP server.\n\n215\n00:13:07.102 --> 00:13:10.465\nBut let's just go ahead and\nfinish this Wizard out and we'll say Yes,\n\n216\n00:13:10.465 --> 00:13:12.633\nI wanna go ahead and\nactivate this scope now.\n\n217\n00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.520\nAll right, and then here you have just\nyour page saying that you were successful,\n\n218\n00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.670\nyou've created your new scope here.\n\n219\n00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:26.270\nAnd you can see that my scope,\nmy sales scope, is noted here as active.\n\n220\n00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:30.876\nBut like I said, we do need to go ahead\nand continue to configure a little bit.\n\n221\n00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:34.613\nSo let's go ahead and make sure that for\n\n222\n00:13:34.613 --> 00:13:40.800\nmy particular DHCP my IPv4 server\nis going to be authorized.\n\n223\n00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.710\nSo we do need to go ahead and do that.\n\n224\n00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee now\nthat we've got it configured and\n\n225\n00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.850\nwe're about to walk through the wizard and\neverything is done.\n\n226\n00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.845\nDoes it just work, are we now set,\nwe don't have to worry about it anymore?\n\n227\n00:13:51.845 --> 00:13:56.317\n&gt;&gt; Well this particular machine is already\nauthorized, but if we take a look at my\n\n228\n00:13:56.317 --> 00:14:00.946\nscreen here, we can see that there is an\noption to go ahead and unauthorize here.\n\n229\n00:14:00.946 --> 00:14:05.560\nIt would be grayed out, and\nI would have the option to authorize.\n\n230\n00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.950\nThere are a couple different ways you can\ndo that, and why would you wanna do it?\n\n231\n00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:15.220\nIf you ever wanted to, perhaps,\ndecommission a particular server or\n\n232\n00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.270\nduring a migration and\nthings of that nature.\n\n233\n00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.040\nSo just knowing that\nthat option is available.\n\n234\n00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.370\nBut I do want to point\nsomething else out as well.\n\n235\n00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:28.770\nWe do have another notion,\nan idea of precedence here.\n\n236\n00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:33.037\nJust like we were looking at previously\nwith the different machines we could set\n\n237\n00:14:33.037 --> 00:14:36.231\nthe IP precedents, but\nhere it's a little bit different.\n\n238\n00:14:36.231 --> 00:14:41.627\nWhen we look at our configurations,\nthis first portion over here on the left,\n\n239\n00:14:41.627 --> 00:14:46.230\nthis first little segment,\nthis is going to be our scope options.\n\n240\n00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.400\nWhereas the section underneath\nwill be our server options.\n\n241\n00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.120\nSo when you go in to configure most likely\npeople in to configure scope options\n\n242\n00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:00.610\ninstead of server options and it really\njust depends on your environment.\n\n243\n00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:05.590\nBut scope options are going to be\noverriding those server options.\n\n244\n00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.970\nSo it's probably a good idea just to\nkeep that in mind and if we look and\n\n245\n00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.660\nsee what kind of scope\noptions are set here.\n\n246\n00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.977\nScope options have\ndifferent numerical values.\n\n247\n00:15:13.977 --> 00:15:16.592\nSo for here, 003 for our routers.\n\n248\n00:15:16.592 --> 00:15:18.593\n006 for our DNS servers.\n\n249\n00:15:18.593 --> 00:15:21.250\nYou don't need to know every\nsingle numerical value.\n\n250\n00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:25.000\nBut it's a good idea to understand\nthe most common ones there.\n\n251\n00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.700\nAnd knowing where to look for those scope\noptions here within GUI because if you do\n\n252\n00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.180\nhave some kind of conflict here with,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n253\n00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.390\ntake a look at our server options.\n\n254\n00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:41.680\nSo if I have any kind of options here I do\nnot, but if I did and they were different\n\n255\n00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:48.990\nlike an IP address was different\nhere before our DNS servers.\n\n256\n00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.790\nAnd I thought they didn’t match up and\nit wasn't boding well,\n\n257\n00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.070\nthen I would have some\nkind of conflict there.\n\n258\n00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:58.050\nSo I just want to check that and\nmake sure everything is good to go there.\n\n259\n00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:03.063\nWe can go through here and take a look\nat our different address pools there,\n\n260\n00:16:03.063 --> 00:16:07.931\nthe ones that we had created,\nthe ones that Was already existing there.\n\n261\n00:16:07.931 --> 00:16:12.371\nAddress leases, currently there are no\nleases but you can go ahead and if I was\n\n262\n00:16:12.371 --> 00:16:18.120\nconnected to a production network, I would\nbe able to see that information there.\n\n263\n00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.670\nReservations, this should have our\none particular reservation there,\n\n264\n00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.100\nI don't see that in there.\n\n265\n00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:30.420\nTo go on the Action &gt; New Reservation, you\ncan also go through and select it there.\n\n266\n00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:36.347\nPolicies, you could go ahead and\nattach any kind of configuration\n\n267\n00:16:36.347 --> 00:16:41.400\npolicies here for your DHCP as well,\nand also apply different filters.\n\n268\n00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.800\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\n\n269\n00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.200\ntake a look at how we can also\ndo things within PowerShell.\n\n270\n00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.300\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, since that\nreservation didn't show up, why don't we\n\n271\n00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:54.260\ngo ahead and just create a reservation,\ncuz that's something that more than likely\n\n272\n00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.870\na server technician or a server\nadministrator will have to be able to do.\n\n273\n00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:01.150\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Ronnie, you are right we did\nnot actually create that reservation,\n\n274\n00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.490\nwe just set an exclusion.\n\n275\n00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:06.040\nSo let's go ahead and create\na reservation now and see how that works.\n\n276\n00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.740\nSo if we take a look at my screen here,\n\n277\n00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.560\nyou just simply right click\nover your reservation portion.\n\n278\n00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.570\nCurrently I have nothing in the center\npane, we don't have any reservations.\n\n279\n00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:17.630\nSo by right clicking, I can go ahead and\n\n280\n00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.840\nlaunch the wizard that will enable\nme to create a reservation.\n\n281\n00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.600\nSo let's say we have a printer and\nwe want to reserve an IP address for that.\n\n282\n00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:32.200\nWe can just type in sales printer, and\nthen go ahead and assign it a MAC address.\n\n283\n00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.443\n&gt;&gt; Or an IP address.\n\n284\n00:17:33.443 --> 00:17:34.905\n&gt;&gt; Or, excuse me, an IP address,\n\n285\n00:17:34.905 --> 00:17:38.499\nI was thinking MAC address because I'm\nthinking we gotta fake this part here.\n\n286\n00:17:38.499 --> 00:17:43.002\nI really don't have a printer with\na MAC address so we'll just say,\n\n287\n00:17:43.002 --> 00:17:48.224\n123456789, 10, you have to have\nat least ten characters there.\n\n288\n00:17:48.224 --> 00:17:52.496\nAnd then the description,\nwe'll just put sales printer.\n\n289\n00:17:52.496 --> 00:17:56.225\n[COUGH] And\nthen we'll say maybe floor three,\n\n290\n00:17:56.225 --> 00:18:01.040\nto help identify that if you\nhave several sales printers.\n\n291\n00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:06.252\nNow when we go ahead and select Add,\nthe operating system is asking me hey,\n\n292\n00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:11.826\nour unique identifier, our MAC address\nthat I've entered may not be correct.\n\n293\n00:18:11.826 --> 00:18:15.767\nWell I definitely did not enter a correct\nMAC address here and it's just notifying\n\n294\n00:18:15.767 --> 00:18:19.306\nme of that, but for this particular\nexample we're just gonna hit OK, but\n\n295\n00:18:19.306 --> 00:18:22.760\nyou really would wanna verify you\nare putting the right MAC address in.\n\n296\n00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.010\nWe'll hit Yes and then go ahead and\nclose out of here.\n\n297\n00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:31.390\nNow you can see that my sales printer\nreservation has been included here.\n\n298\n00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:34.230\nIf it doesn't show up\nautomatically you may just need to\n\n299\n00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.680\nrefresh the Management Console page,\nsometimes it gets stuck like that.\n\n300\n00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:44.810\nBut let's also, I wanna show you one other\nthing we can do here within the GUI before\n\n301\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:48.930\nwe also look at PowerShell cmdlets that\nwe can use to perform functions as well.\n\n302\n00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.445\nIf I left click on my actual server\nover here on the left pane, and\n\n303\n00:18:54.445 --> 00:19:00.110\nthen right click, I really need to think\nabout backing up and creating backups.\n\n304\n00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:04.240\nBecause let's say I go into my DHCP\nserver and I configure all these options,\n\n305\n00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.290\nmy my reservations, and\nthen something happens to that machine,\n\n306\n00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.010\nI'm kinda hosed, I'd have to go back and\nredo all that work.\n\n307\n00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.280\nSo what I can do here is go ahead and\ncreate a backup.\n\n308\n00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:22.610\nBy default under the C drive, under the\nSystem 32, you'll have a DHCP folder, and\n\n309\n00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:26.820\nthen a backup folder, that's the default\nlocation, you can change that if you like,\n\n310\n00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.020\nbut we're just gonna leave it in\nthe default for now, we'll hit OK.\n\n311\n00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.460\nAnd let's change things up a bit.\n\n312\n00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.810\nLet's go back to our reservation, go ahead\nand right click on it, select Delete, and\n\n313\n00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.990\nwe're gonna delete out this reservation.\n\n314\n00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:46.784\nAnd now let's say someone accidentally\ndeleted something, one of your sysadmins,\n\n315\n00:19:46.784 --> 00:19:52.108\nwell if we go back onto our server and\nthen right click, we can select Restore.\n\n316\n00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:56.410\nAnd this is the default\nlocation that we had selected\n\n317\n00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:01.121\nhere under the System32 &gt; DHCP &gt; Backup,\nall right.\n\n318\n00:20:01.121 --> 00:20:05.457\nJust make sure you are pulling back in\nthe correct version if you have multiple\n\n319\n00:20:05.457 --> 00:20:09.794\nversions, points in time of those\nparticular backups, and then go ahead and\n\n320\n00:20:09.794 --> 00:20:10.480\nselect OK.\n\n321\n00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:17.660\nNow, you're gonna be notified of a stop\nand a restart here for that service.\n\n322\n00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:23.300\nAnd if you think about the way DHCP works,\nyou might be okay with stopping and\n\n323\n00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.140\nrestarting it during normal business\nhours, because unless you have\n\n324\n00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:31.300\na really short least duration time, and\nyou have people constantly pegging and\n\n325\n00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:35.020\nrequesting the DHCP server for\nan address, that may be an issue.\n\n326\n00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.550\nBut for this demonstration, I think\nwe'll be okay if we just go ahead and\n\n327\n00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:39.200\nselect Yes.\n\n328\n00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:44.490\nAnd then here we see our ancient\nlittle ticker just stopping and\n\n329\n00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.350\nrestarting that service there for us.\n\n330\n00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.697\nIt should only take a moment, we don't\nhave a lot of information in here.\n\n331\n00:20:51.697 --> 00:20:56.148\nAll right, now it says the database\nwas restored successfully, so\n\n332\n00:20:56.148 --> 00:21:00.538\nlet's check our work here and\nverify that in fact it actually was.\n\n333\n00:21:00.538 --> 00:21:04.904\nIf we look under our IPv4 for\nour scope options here,\n\n334\n00:21:04.904 --> 00:21:10.159\nlet's go ahead and expand that out and\ncheck for reservations.\n\n335\n00:21:10.159 --> 00:21:13.770\nAnd let's see,\nI don't have a reservation there?\n\n336\n00:21:17.418 --> 00:21:21.330\nLet me make sure it wasn't under,\nwe didn't create it under R, there it is,\n\n337\n00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.666\nit was-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was gonna say wow.\n\n338\n00:21:22.666 --> 00:21:26.220\n&gt;&gt; It was under our server options\nhere and not our scope, or\n\n339\n00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.233\nwait it is our scope,\nthat was my other scope, I'm sorry guys.\n\n340\n00:21:30.233 --> 00:21:32.172\nThis scope was not the one\nthat we had created,\n\n341\n00:21:32.172 --> 00:21:35.206\nthis was the one that was there already\nand I should have seen the little,\n\n342\n00:21:35.206 --> 00:21:38.010\nthat little down arrow means\nthat it is not active there.\n\n343\n00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:39.500\nSo I just looked in the wrong section, but\n\n344\n00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:44.400\nthat is the correct reservation and the\nrestoration process did, in fact, work.\n\n345\n00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.710\nSo we know it's a good,\nfunctioning backup copy,\n\n346\n00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:50.080\nand that's something that you\ndefinitely wanna check also.\n\n347\n00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.490\nBecause creating backups every\nsingle week, or month, or\n\n348\n00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.570\nwhatever your scheme may be is fine,\nbut you also need to test them and\n\n349\n00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:59.520\nmaking sure you're actually backing up\nthe information that you want to back up.\n\n350\n00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:04.745\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, well thank you for\nhelping us out in getting started\n\n351\n00:22:04.745 --> 00:22:09.860\nin terms of setting up the DHCP\nscope as well as the reservation.\n\n352\n00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:13.450\nShowing us of course not only backing up\nis important, but also how to restore that\n\n353\n00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:18.930\nas well using the actual regular web\ninterface that we normally have here.\n\n354\n00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:22.620\nNow there is still a lot more to go cuz\nwe're about to get into some PowerShell,\n\n355\n00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.580\nbut we're running out of time, so\n\n356\n00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:29.100\nthat means we are going to stop and\nget a part two out of this show as well.\n\n357\n00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:33.300\nSo for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n358\n00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.195\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n359\n00:22:34.195 --> 00:22:38.906\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Windows Server 101 shows.\n\n360\n00:22:38.906 --> 00:22:44.673\n[MUSIC]\n\n361\n00:22:44.673 --> 00:22:48.261\nThank you for watching, ITPRO TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.212\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.212 --> 00:00:12.357\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.357 --> 00:00:15.050\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.580\nYou're watching\nthe Windows Server 101 show.\n\n7\n00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.350\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n8\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.430\ntoday, we're gonna be taking a look at\npart 2 on managing a DHCP server role.\n\n9\n00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.190\nAnd here to help us with that part\n2 is gonna be Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.570\nCherokee, welcome back to the studios.\n\n11\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.580\n&gt;&gt; Hey Ronnie, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.510\n&gt;&gt; It's going well.\n\n13\n00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.660\nSo Cherokee, in our part 1 we\ndid take a look at the idea of\n\n14\n00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.260\nconfiguring that DHTP and getting started\nbut we look a look at through the actual\n\n15\n00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.431\nserver manager interface and of course the\nmanager itself, and getting all that done.\n\n16\n00:00:46.431 --> 00:00:47.613\nWhat are we taking a look\nat in our part two?\n\n17\n00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:50.375\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, in this episode what we're\ngonna do is, there is one topic that I\n\n18\n00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:54.365\nwanted to touch on, and\nthat's going to be our DHCP relay agents.\n\n19\n00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:58.175\nAnd then after that, we'll go ahead and\nlook at some of the other functions that\n\n20\n00:00:58.175 --> 00:01:02.180\nwe executed through the GUI, but this time\nwe're gonna go ahead and use PowerShell.\n\n21\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.170\nSo, lets go ahead and get started.\n\n22\n00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.440\nIf we can take a look at\nmy screen I just want to,\n\n23\n00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.416\nyou guys probably remember this\nslide from the previous episode.\n\n24\n00:01:10.416 --> 00:01:14.660\nBut here, we have just that reminder\nof that Dora process that happens\n\n25\n00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.510\nwhen our clients are going\nto be connecting and\n\n26\n00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.060\ntrying to obtain an IP\naddress from the DHCP server.\n\n27\n00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.290\nSo I wanted to kind of bring something\nto your awareness about something\n\n28\n00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.830\ncalled a DHCP relay agent, that's\ngoing to be Microsoft's terminology.\n\n29\n00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.270\nCisco uses the term IP helper.\n\n30\n00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.940\nAnd then sometimes you'll even see,\n\n31\n00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.110\nin other documentation,\nan RFC 1542 compliant router.\n\n32\n00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.490\nAnd what we're talking about here is,\n\n33\n00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.730\nif you think about the way that\nthat process works, that first step\n\n34\n00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.250\nis going to be where the client is sending\nout a broadcast transmission, right?\n\n35\n00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.320\nSo if we look at this diagram here,\nI have two separate network segments,\n\n36\n00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.318\nand they're going to be\nconnected via a router.\n\n37\n00:01:57.318 --> 00:02:00.450\nAnd inside the segment one\nover here I have a switch\n\n38\n00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.270\nwith all my devices connected.\n\n39\n00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.880\nSo if you think about switches,\nbreaking up those collision domains,\n\n40\n00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.620\nwhereas routers are gonna be\nbreaking up your broadcast domains.\n\n41\n00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.913\nIf I did not have a DHCP server within my\nenvironment, and I were to try to call\n\n42\n00:02:16.913 --> 00:02:22.045\nout to connect and communicate with\na DHCP server in a different segment,\n\n43\n00:02:22.045 --> 00:02:27.624\nthen this router, by default, would\nprohibit that broadcast transmission.\n\n44\n00:02:27.624 --> 00:02:32.564\nSo, something we can do, maybe I don't\nhave the budget to have multiple DHCP\n\n45\n00:02:32.564 --> 00:02:34.773\nservers in every single segment.\n\n46\n00:02:34.773 --> 00:02:39.779\nSo what I can do is, I can allow that\nrouter, configure it to go ahead and\n\n47\n00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.624\nallow those broadcast\ntransmissions to traverse it.\n\n48\n00:02:43.624 --> 00:02:48.736\nAnd allow that DHCP server to obtain that\ncommunication, and then respond back,\n\n49\n00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:53.070\nunicast, to that individual so\nthey can still obtain an IP address.\n\n50\n00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.110\nSo, in the book,\nBrian does a really good example,\n\n51\n00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.570\na lab, of the step by step process.\n\n52\n00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.250\nYou're gonna need to go ahead and\nset up routing your remote access, and\n\n53\n00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.370\nthen configure that as a DHCP relay agent.\n\n54\n00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.080\nSo that's pretty cool that's\nan option that you do have\n\n55\n00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.580\nif you're in a situation and\nyou just don't have enough DHCP servers.\n\n56\n00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.190\nNow, the next thing I wanna do is go\nahead and hop into PowerShell here.\n\n57\n00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.040\nBecause we really need to be familiar.\n\n58\n00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.560\nI know Ronnie warned you about it.\n\n59\n00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.410\nWe were gonna be using PowerShell\nquite a bit throughout this show.\n\n60\n00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.590\nSo what I wanna do is talk about\nmanaging DHCP through PowerShell.\n\n61\n00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.870\nSo here is the thing.\n\n62\n00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.990\nIn the previous episode you saw that\nwhen we installed in thought the GUI,\n\n63\n00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.288\nwe had an option to also\ninclude those management tools.\n\n64\n00:03:37.288 --> 00:03:40.840\nIf I do not have those\nmanagement tools installed,\n\n65\n00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.306\nI am not going to be able to use my\nDHCP commandlet module here to go ahead,\n\n66\n00:03:46.306 --> 00:03:50.240\nor command module to\nexecute these commands.\n\n67\n00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.870\nSo that is something you need to think\nabout, whatever machine you are planning\n\n68\n00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.770\non managing, like we've talked about\nwith those management tools, it's\n\n69\n00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.610\ngonna be the one that you will be using\nto go ahead and perform these functions.\n\n70\n00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.724\nSo, to go ahead and invoke that module,\n\n71\n00:04:03.724 --> 00:04:09.263\nfirst we're gonna go ahead\ntype in get-command,\n\n72\n00:04:09.263 --> 00:04:12.790\nSpace -Module, and\n\n73\n00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.660\nthis is going to be DHCPServer,\nso go ahead and invoke that.\n\n74\n00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.770\nNow, whenever we set up,\n\n75\n00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.760\nyou can see all the different commands\nthat we have associated here.\n\n76\n00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.970\nThere are quite a bit,\n\n77\n00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.518\nTechnet also does a really good job of\nexplaining the different commandlets.\n\n78\n00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:31.870\nThere are even sites out there\nwhere people have forums, and\n\n79\n00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.520\nthey post different scripting environments\nand scripts for you to share.\n\n80\n00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.070\nSo there's a lot here,\n\n81\n00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.780\nyou can also use the tab function\nlike Ronnie had mentioned.\n\n82\n00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.330\nI'm gonna try to type it out for\nthe most part here, so bear with me.\n\n83\n00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.780\nHopefully, we don't have too many typos,\nwe'll see how this goes.\n\n84\n00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.890\nThe first thing I wanna\ndo is create a scope.\n\n85\n00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:55.090\nSo if your colleague did create a scope\nin the GUI, so there's quite a bit here.\n\n86\n00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.180\nBut we're just gonna go ahead and clear\nthis out for now and create our scope.\n\n87\n00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.710\nThe first thing we want to do is\ngo ahead and type add-DhcpServer.\n\n88\n00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.250\nAnd this is going to be,\nyou're going to add v4 for version four.\n\n89\n00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.200\nLet me move it so you can see it,\nthat little plus symbol's in the way.\n\n90\n00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.540\nOkay, so this is gonna be Server Four,\nand then we're gonna specify scope.\n\n91\n00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.700\nAnd then, space dash give it a name for\nour particular scope.\n\n92\n00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.420\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\ncall this Test Scope for now.\n\n93\n00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.600\nAnd we need to specify\nour specific ranges.\n\n94\n00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.900\nSo we'll go ahead and\nbegin with this start range here.\n\n95\n00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.010\nSo this start range is going\nto be 192.168.1.100, and\n\n96\n00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.990\nthen we'll specify our end range.\n\n97\n00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:50.824\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\ngive that 192.168.1.200.\n\n98\n00:05:50.824 --> 00:05:56.654\nYou also need to include the subset mask\nhere, so we'll specify that as well.\n\n99\n00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.630\nAnd that's gonna be a class C.\n\n100\n00:06:04.231 --> 00:06:06.400\nAnd we'll go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n101\n00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.820\nNothing really happened.\n\n102\n00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.310\nNo bells and whistles or alarm.\n\n103\n00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.570\nSo what I wanna do is hop\nback in the GUI to see and\n\n104\n00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.460\nshow you that we've actually\ncreated the scope here.\n\n105\n00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.620\nAnd I also want to show you something\nelse that happens just by using that\n\n106\n00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.190\nparticular commandlet, that command.\n\n107\n00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.140\nSo let's go under a server manager and\nbring up server tools,\n\n108\n00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:29.860\nour DHCP management console, just give it\na second, it might be a little bit slower.\n\n109\n00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.070\nHere we can see our\nparticular server setup here.\n\n110\n00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.270\nLet's go ahead and expand out IPV version\n4, that's what we're working with.\n\n111\n00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.990\nAnd here I see my scope\nthat I'd just created,\n\n112\n00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.790\nif I can move this on over for you.\n\n113\n00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.530\nRight here, this is the scope.\n\n114\n00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.310\nNow, just like creating that scope and\n\n115\n00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.010\nusing that command, I didn't\nspecify any kind of scope options.\n\n116\n00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.200\nSo if we go down here and\n\n117\n00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.480\ncheck out our scope options,\nyou can see that none had been generated.\n\n118\n00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.332\nSo what we want to do is at least\ngo ahead, and let's go ahead and\n\n119\n00:07:02.332 --> 00:07:06.870\nassign a router through PowerShell here,\nso let's go ahead and do that.\n\n120\n00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.483\nPull Power shell back up.\n\n121\n00:07:12.593 --> 00:07:16.934\nAlright, so for this command,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n122\n00:07:16.934 --> 00:07:22.189\nselect set, type set, dash dhcp,\nand then server, version four.\n\n123\n00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:25.202\nThis is going to be our option value.\n\n124\n00:07:30.263 --> 00:07:32.270\nAnd our scope ID.\n\n125\n00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.930\nScope ID,\nwe're going to specify our scope ID.\n\n126\n00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:40.320\nWhat you want to do is take\nthe last octet of your\n\n127\n00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.710\nranges there, and\njust put it as a 0 for scope ID.\n\n128\n00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:50.109\nSo scope ID space and then 192.168.1.0,\n\n129\n00:07:50.109 --> 00:07:54.950\nand end quote, and specify our router.\n\n130\n00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:01.213\nAnd the IP address for\nour router's gonna be 192.168.1.10.\n\n131\n00:08:01.213 --> 00:08:03.742\nAnd we'll go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n132\n00:08:03.742 --> 00:08:07.454\nAll right, again not a lot of\ninformation that was displayed so\n\n133\n00:08:07.454 --> 00:08:12.290\nlet's go back in the GUI to verify that\nwe actually executed that command.\n\n134\n00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.101\nPull up our DHCP console here.\n\n135\n00:08:15.101 --> 00:08:19.193\nNow, notice that it didn't\nautomatically update or refresh, so\n\n136\n00:08:19.193 --> 00:08:23.100\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust manually push that through.\n\n137\n00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.923\nUnder the Action menu here,\nwe'll go ahead and select Refresh.\n\n138\n00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.840\nAnd now you can see that\nI do have an option.\n\n139\n00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.506\nRemember our number, 003, for\nthis particular router option.\n\n140\n00:08:33.506 --> 00:08:35.880\nAnd I can go ahead and\ndouble click on that.\n\n141\n00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.580\nAnd see, I really didn't specify\nany other options here but\n\n142\n00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.870\nit is in fact listed as my\ndefault gateway at this time.\n\n143\n00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.900\nSo, what else can we do here,\nwithin PowerShell?\n\n144\n00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.422\nLet's see.\n\n145\n00:08:49.422 --> 00:08:52.422\nI might wanna go ahead and take a look\nat all the different scopes that\n\n146\n00:08:52.422 --> 00:08:54.330\nare installed on this particular system.\n\n147\n00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:59.170\nSo if I go ahead and type in View,\nand this is going to be space.\n\n148\n00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.030\nOops sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.\n\n149\n00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.640\n[LAUGH] The wrong commandlet.\n\n150\n00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.584\nHere let's go ahead and do Get-,\n\n151\n00:09:08.584 --> 00:09:13.209\nthis is gonna be DhcpServerv4Scope and\n\n152\n00:09:13.209 --> 00:09:19.747\nthen we'll go go ahead and\npipe it out into a format list.\n\n153\n00:09:22.177 --> 00:09:25.470\nAnd see our scopes listed here.\n\n154\n00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.960\nAll right, and that was the one that\nwas already there, the Local Network1.\n\n155\n00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.191\nAnd then the one that\nwe just generated for\n\n156\n00:09:34.191 --> 00:09:38.620\nour, test scope right here.\n\n157\n00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.624\nAll right, so\n\n158\n00:09:39.624 --> 00:09:45.248\nyou can see them if there are a lot of\ndifferent scopes within your environment.\n\n159\n00:09:45.248 --> 00:09:48.290\nYou can also add additional filters\nwhenever you're selecting that query.\n\n160\n00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:49.840\nJust hop on over at TecnNet, like I said,\n\n161\n00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.270\nyou guys saw how many different options\nthat we had there it's quite extensive.\n\n162\n00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:58.740\nThe other thing that I wanna show you\nhere, Ronnie did you have a question?\n\n163\n00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.360\n&gt;&gt; Well it's just trying to make\nsure that we remember this idea of\n\n164\n00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.420\nwhat Cherokee just showed us here, right?\n\n165\n00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.560\nWhen we're creating the scope\nusing the PoewrShell,\n\n166\n00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.020\nshe could create multiple scopes at\none time, which is actually very nice.\n\n167\n00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.650\nEspecially when we have an organization\nthat does require us to have three or\n\n168\n00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.470\nfour different subnets\nusing the same DHCP server.\n\n169\n00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.680\nIf you remember in Part 1, if you have it,\nmake sure you go back and see it.\n\n170\n00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.530\nWhen we create a scope using, of course,\nthe interface and then what we use\n\n171\n00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:32.200\nin the DHCP management console, well,\nwe can only create one scope at a time.\n\n172\n00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.590\nSo there are some limitations\nthrough the graphical user interface\n\n173\n00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:37.980\nthat we don't think about.\n\n174\n00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.796\nBut until you get into the PowerShell and\nthen you realize that really all Cherokee\n\n175\n00:10:41.796 --> 00:10:44.848\nhas to do for a second scope, or\na third scope, or a fourth scope.\n\n176\n00:10:44.848 --> 00:10:46.406\nEven only one at a time if she wanted to,\n\n177\n00:10:46.406 --> 00:10:48.352\nis hit her up arrow after\nshe creates that scope.\n\n178\n00:10:48.352 --> 00:10:49.056\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n179\n00:10:49.056 --> 00:10:53.555\n&gt;&gt; And just change the numbers and change\nthe name and that makes it very efficient.\n\n180\n00:10:53.555 --> 00:10:57.265\nAnd if you get better at using the\nPowerShell, you can even script it out and\n\n181\n00:10:57.265 --> 00:11:00.305\njust go ahead say let me create five\nof these different scopes right\n\n182\n00:11:00.305 --> 00:11:03.325\naway very simply running\nthat one PowerShell script.\n\n183\n00:11:03.325 --> 00:11:05.150\nSo don't overlook this.\n\n184\n00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.081\nDon't say I'll never do that.\n\n185\n00:11:06.081 --> 00:11:07.924\n&gt;&gt; We're just scratching the surface here.\n\n186\n00:11:07.924 --> 00:11:09.478\nPowershell has so much more to offer.\n\n187\n00:11:09.478 --> 00:11:12.425\nAnd like we just added the router option.\n\n188\n00:11:12.425 --> 00:11:15.650\nBut you can add multiple options,\njust through PowerShell,\n\n189\n00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:16.950\nyou just have to go ahead.\n\n190\n00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.760\nAnd Microsoft has all the syntax, and you\njust have to kind of plug and chug there,\n\n191\n00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.230\nso pretty cool.\n\n192\n00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.530\nThe next thing I wanna look at\ntoo is what about statistics?\n\n193\n00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:29.990\nSo Ronnie had mentioned, maybe you have\na lot of information on your system.\n\n194\n00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.890\nAnd as a sys admin, you're probably\ngonna wanna retain that information and\n\n195\n00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:35.480\ndocument it.\n\n196\n00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:40.570\nSo if I go ahead and pull up our\nstatistics I can use the command line.\n\n197\n00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:45.670\nWell let's go ahead and type in or\nthe command Get-Dhcp and\n\n198\n00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:52.749\nthis is going to be Serverv4 and\nthis is gonna be scope statistics oops.\n\n199\n00:11:58.856 --> 00:12:04.090\nScopeStatistics and\nthis should give us our information.\n\n200\n00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.181\nThis is a high level overview here.\n\n201\n00:12:06.181 --> 00:12:10.583\nYou can become more granular with that,\nbut it just shows us our two free scopes,\n\n202\n00:12:10.583 --> 00:12:14.208\nhow many available IP addresses are free,\nhow many are in use, and\n\n203\n00:12:14.208 --> 00:12:17.035\nthen it will also break it\ndown in the percentages.\n\n204\n00:12:17.035 --> 00:12:23.330\nWe don't have any reservations set\ncurrently and this is important.\n\n205\n00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.190\nIf you're managing a DHCP server,\n\n206\n00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:29.070\nyou wanna verify that you're not\nrunning out of available IP addresses.\n\n207\n00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.939\nSo what if you do have multiple scopes,\nand you wanna get a quick answer, and say,\n\n208\n00:12:32.939 --> 00:12:35.815\nhey, are there scopes that\nare being used more than others?\n\n209\n00:12:35.815 --> 00:12:38.697\nAnd when you're performing\nyour auditing type functions,\n\n210\n00:12:38.697 --> 00:12:41.530\nthe next command is gonna\nbe pretty useful for that.\n\n211\n00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:46.439\nSo if I wanted to specify a parameter\nwe think about the 80/20 rule.\n\n212\n00:12:46.439 --> 00:12:50.160\nWe should kinda be concerned when we\nthink about anything coming up to 80%.\n\n213\n00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.550\nIt really depends on the system but\n\n214\n00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:56.960\nit's kind of a general rule\nlike 80% being utilized here.\n\n215\n00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.520\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nstick with that.\n\n216\n00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:03.498\nWe'll use the command list,\nGet-Dhcp, this is gonna be our\n\n217\n00:13:03.498 --> 00:13:08.861\nServerv4ScopeStatistics, I could\nhave did the up arrow there,\n\n218\n00:13:08.861 --> 00:13:16.870\nto help with the typing but,\nScopeStatistics, and\n\n219\n00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:21.170\nthis is going to, we're gonna pipe this\nout and and give it a where parameters.\n\n220\n00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:29.040\nSo this is, oops,\nThis is gonna be where the percent in use.\n\n221\n00:13:33.008 --> 00:13:34.540\nIs going to be.\n\n222\n00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:38.017\nAnd then here we have our-\n&gt;&gt; That should be percentage in\n\n223\n00:13:38.017 --> 00:13:38.641\nuses by the way.\n\n224\n00:13:38.641 --> 00:13:40.070\n&gt;&gt; Percentage okay let me see.\n\n225\n00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.969\nIs going to be greater than GT and\nthen 80%.\n\n226\n00:13:49.969 --> 00:13:53.043\n&gt;&gt; So here Cherokee you're\nusing a comparison operator.\n\n227\n00:13:53.043 --> 00:13:59.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes so this little -gt for\ngreater than is our comparison operator.\n\n228\n00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:05.010\nAnd actually let me pull up,\nI've got a browser here somewhere for you.\n\n229\n00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.317\nThere's a link in the show notes here, and\n\n230\n00:14:09.317 --> 00:14:12.638\nit shows you different\ncomparison operators.\n\n231\n00:14:12.638 --> 00:14:18.910\nSo you can see, like the one we just\nused there was the gt for greater than.\n\n232\n00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:22.100\nNow when we just ran that\ncommand nothing showed up.\n\n233\n00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.172\nNothing happened because we\njust created those scopes and\n\n234\n00:14:25.172 --> 00:14:27.900\nthey're not being utilized\ngreater than 80%.\n\n235\n00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.710\nSo if we wanted to modify that,\nthat's a quick fix here.\n\n236\n00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.690\nWe just change that gt to an lt for\nless than.\n\n237\n00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:35.910\nSo that's what we'll go ahead and do.\n\n238\n00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.490\nLet's go back to the PowerShell and\nsee what our results would be there.\n\n239\n00:14:42.462 --> 00:14:46.489\nAll right, so for this one I definitely\njust wanna hit the up arrow because I'm\n\n240\n00:14:46.489 --> 00:14:50.470\nonly changing the last portion here and\nso I'll go ahead put lt for less then.\n\n241\n00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.180\nAnd then type in 80 and hit Enter.\n\n242\n00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:57.568\nNow, because both of my scopes are not\nbeing utilized, at least 80% capacity,\n\n243\n00:14:57.568 --> 00:15:01.144\nyou can see that they're both listed\nhere along with the statistics\n\n244\n00:15:01.144 --> 00:15:02.790\nthat we've previously seen.\n\n245\n00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:07.565\nSo that's pretty cool something you\ncould do rather quickly just to\n\n246\n00:15:07.565 --> 00:15:09.584\nget a brief overview there.\n\n247\n00:15:09.584 --> 00:15:12.060\n&gt;&gt; And Cherokee, thanks for\nactually showing us that.\n\n248\n00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.760\nBut you had just mentioned the idea\nof being able to create the scopes.\n\n249\n00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.912\nSeeing that the statistics,\nthey're really good and\n\n250\n00:15:17.912 --> 00:15:19.652\nthere's something that's very helpful.\n\n251\n00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:21.868\nBut also creating that scope\nwould be helpful as well.\n\n252\n00:15:21.868 --> 00:15:25.194\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so Ronnie when you talk\nabout reservations we created one\n\n253\n00:15:25.194 --> 00:15:28.212\nin the GUI earlier in a prior episode but\nlet's go ahead and\n\n254\n00:15:28.212 --> 00:15:31.922\ntake a look at how we can create\na reservation straight off PowerShell.\n\n255\n00:15:31.922 --> 00:15:36.404\nSo on my screen what I've done here,\nthis is kind of a long one to go ahead and\n\n256\n00:15:36.404 --> 00:15:41.140\nspecify that reservation so I just\ncopied and pasted this into Notepad.\n\n257\n00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.250\nAnd put it on two lines,\n\n258\n00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:47.030\nbut there is no enter here when your\ntyping it into PowerShell, fyi.\n\n259\n00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.322\nLet's take a look at the actual\ncommand that we're using.\n\n260\n00:15:49.322 --> 00:15:54.299\nSo it's gonna be,\nAdd-DhcpServerv4Reservation.\n\n261\n00:15:54.299 --> 00:15:56.292\nAnd then you'll specify the scope ID.\n\n262\n00:15:56.292 --> 00:15:59.992\nRemember, this is going to be\nKind of like your network ID,\n\n263\n00:15:59.992 --> 00:16:04.410\nwe're gonna be using the last\noctet is going to be a 0 here.\n\n264\n00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:09.230\nAnd for the next portion,\nspace -IPaddress, and then you'll specify\n\n265\n00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:14.530\nthe actual IP address that you are looking\nto create this reservation for.\n\n266\n00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:18.793\nNow, when we look at this ClientId,\nthis is going to be the MAC address\n\n267\n00:16:18.793 --> 00:16:22.209\nof the device that you're\ntrying to reserve the IP for.\n\n268\n00:16:22.209 --> 00:16:25.139\nSo, we need to go ahead and put that in.\n\n269\n00:16:25.139 --> 00:16:29.796\nI just grabbed this one from Brian's book\nbecause this is actually listed as a lab\n\n270\n00:16:29.796 --> 00:16:32.240\nand guys have access to that.\n\n271\n00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.400\nAnd you also have the option to\nprovide a description of what is nice,\n\n272\n00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.390\nif you just want to make it easier for\nothers so\n\n273\n00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.290\nwe send training on printer, I'm just\ngonna go ahead and get out of here and\n\n274\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.970\nyou can see that these are even typed and\nwe'll go ahead and execute that.\n\n275\n00:16:49.207 --> 00:16:53.228\nAll right, now, not a whole lot happens.\n\n276\n00:16:53.228 --> 00:16:56.623\nAnd since I had that little clipboard\nin my lab environment pop up,\n\n277\n00:16:56.623 --> 00:17:01.063\nlet's go ahead and check to see if that\nreservation was in fact created in the.\n\n278\n00:17:01.063 --> 00:17:06.574\nSo, let's go back to Server Manager pull\nup our DH DHCP management console and\n\n279\n00:17:06.574 --> 00:17:08.670\nsee if we have a reservation.\n\n280\n00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.630\nMan, that clipboard just-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know-\n\n281\n00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:11.520\n&gt;&gt; Want some attention there.\n\n282\n00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.320\n&gt;&gt; If that actually ran.\n\n283\n00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.440\nSo you might have to run that command.\n\n284\n00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.730\n&gt;&gt; We might need to run it again.\n\n285\n00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.070\nLet's see if it's in there.\n\n286\n00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:21.796\nSo if we go under our particular\nScope here and then check for\n\n287\n00:17:21.796 --> 00:17:25.766\nReservations I don't\nhave any reservations, so\n\n288\n00:17:25.766 --> 00:17:30.983\nlet's go back and try to actually\nhit enter and run that command.\n\n289\n00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:32.901\nThis little guy,\nlet me go it says don't show this again,\n\n290\n00:17:32.901 --> 00:17:34.326\nit will probably pop\nup one more time here.\n\n291\n00:17:34.326 --> 00:17:38.010\nI'll get rid of it,\nI shouldn't done it the first time.\n\n292\n00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:42.625\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n293\n00:17:42.625 --> 00:17:43.282\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nNow, we got it.\n\n294\n00:17:43.282 --> 00:17:44.058\nAll right.\n\n295\n00:17:44.058 --> 00:17:48.495\nSo, let's go back and let's just show you\nto verify that it is actually there so\n\n296\n00:17:48.495 --> 00:17:50.840\nwe'll hit action and then refresh.\n\n297\n00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.630\nAnd you can see that this particular\nreservation if you right click or\n\n298\n00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:56.810\nactually.\n\n299\n00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:02.410\nWe can go here and select the options and\nsee that that's been selected there.\n\n300\n00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:03.380\nHold on give me one second.\n\n301\n00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:05.880\nMove this over.\n\n302\n00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.760\nRight click over here.\n\n303\n00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.040\nSelect properties.\n\n304\n00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.570\nAnd it should have that description.\n\n305\n00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.290\nAnd you can see training room printer.\n\n306\n00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:18.470\nThis is that MAC address we provided and\nthe IP address there.\n\n307\n00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:19.870\nSo we know it's there.\n\n308\n00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.622\nAll right.\nSo, this is just one particular\n\n309\n00:18:21.622 --> 00:18:24.850\nreservation, one configuration\nthat we've done.\n\n310\n00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:29.070\nBut in the previous episode we looked\nat how we could back up through GUI but\n\n311\n00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:32.790\nI do want you to know that you can back up\nand restore through Powershell as well.\n\n312\n00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.978\nSo that's what we'll be\ntaking a look at next here.\n\n313\n00:18:34.978 --> 00:18:40.981\nSo, to go ahead and back up,\nalso I do wanna show one more thing,\n\n314\n00:18:40.981 --> 00:18:44.100\nthere is a command that you can use.\n\n315\n00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.430\nLet's go ahead and look at this.\n\n316\n00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:53.500\nThis is gonna be Git,\nthis is Git-DHCP server version 4.\n\n317\n00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.200\nAnd this is going to be leased.\n\n318\n00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.980\nL E A S E and\nthen your going to put the scope ID.\n\n319\n00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:04.680\nNow we don't have machines connecting to\n\n320\n00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.060\nthis DHCP server requesting\nIP addresses currently.\n\n321\n00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.980\nThis is just a Lab demo environment but\nwe did create that one reservation.\n\n322\n00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:13.600\nSo.\n\n323\n00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:18.400\nThat lease should be listed here and\nby typing in this command we can see\n\n324\n00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.440\nthe different leases that have been\nlisted and let me just check that.\n\n325\n00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:29.580\nDHCP get,\nDHCP server version 4 lease -ScopeId,\n\n326\n00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:36.130\n192, I typed the wrong My PR ask\nopen that give me one second.\n\n327\n00:19:38.354 --> 00:19:43.349\nA little trans-position there.\n\n328\n00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.984\nOkay.\n\n329\n00:19:46.984 --> 00:19:50.714\nNow, we can see this is that reservation\nthat we just created and unlike I said,\n\n330\n00:19:50.714 --> 00:19:54.221\nthis is the only one that is listed but\nif we had a production environment and\n\n331\n00:19:54.221 --> 00:19:57.200\nhad people connecting they\nshould be here as well.\n\n332\n00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:02.483\nYou can see that IP address that we had\nrequested and you see that Mac address but\n\n333\n00:20:02.483 --> 00:20:07.207\nthe address state, it's just\nan inactive reservation currently but\n\n334\n00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:09.222\nyou still see it listed here.\n\n335\n00:20:09.222 --> 00:20:12.960\nNow, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the backup process.\n\n336\n00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.650\nIt was very simple to do that through the\ngrid but it's just as easy to do it right\n\n337\n00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:24.190\nhere through PowerShell So the command\nhere is going to be backup-DHCP.\n\n338\n00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:28.558\nAnd this going to be our server.\n\n339\n00:20:28.558 --> 00:20:32.000\nAnd our path.\n\n340\n00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.376\nHere and if you recall we specify that\nour path was gonna be under the C-Drive,\n\n341\n00:20:36.376 --> 00:20:39.559\nthat was the default location\nif you wanted to go ahead and\n\n342\n00:20:39.559 --> 00:20:43.735\nchange that you will just need to be\naware of where you are putting that, but\n\n343\n00:20:43.735 --> 00:20:46.019\nwe gonna put it in the default location.\n\n344\n00:20:46.019 --> 00:20:49.667\nWe're just gonna be under windows and\n\n345\n00:20:49.667 --> 00:20:54.797\nthis is gonna be our system\n32 file folder and then,\n\n346\n00:20:54.797 --> 00:20:59.930\nwe have the DHCP folder,\nand then the backup folder.\n\n347\n00:21:03.668 --> 00:21:06.470\nOkay, and\nagain not a lot is really happening here.\n\n348\n00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:09.740\nNo bells and\nwhistles to alert you of that.\n\n349\n00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.041\nSo, what we're gonna do is we're just\ngonna do a little test of the experiment\n\n350\n00:21:14.041 --> 00:21:17.839\nhere to see if our backup has actually\nbeen generated and is working.\n\n351\n00:21:17.839 --> 00:21:21.515\nSo, what we'll do is hop back over\nto our management console and\n\n352\n00:21:21.515 --> 00:21:25.550\nlet's just go ahead and delete that\nreservation that we had created.\n\n353\n00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:29.236\nAgain, let's say it was\nan accidental deletion and\n\n354\n00:21:29.236 --> 00:21:32.348\nwe wanted to go ahead and\nbring that back in.\n\n355\n00:21:32.348 --> 00:21:35.910\nI called Ronnie and said, Ronnie, my gosh,\nI accidentally deleted that reservation.\n\n356\n00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:36.570\nWhat do I do?\n\n357\n00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.596\nSo, let's go back into\nPowerShell to go ahead and\n\n358\n00:21:39.596 --> 00:21:42.780\nperform that restoration process.\n\n359\n00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.220\nNow, this one's pretty easy.\n\n360\n00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.200\nWe're just gonna go ahead and\nhit the up arrow and bring it on back and\n\n361\n00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.270\nchange that back up to restore because\n\n362\n00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.890\nthe back up that I'm pulling in isn't\nthe same back up that I just created.\n\n363\n00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.410\nSo, you wanna make sure that you're\nbringing that correct back up and\n\n364\n00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.000\nyou can see the location that\npath is still the same there.\n\n365\n00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.910\nSo we'll go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n366\n00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:07.470\nNow, you're going to get a notification,\nand\n\n367\n00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:11.940\nit says that, actually it says do you\nwant to go ahead and perform this action?\n\n368\n00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.880\nWe'll hit Yes first.\n\n369\n00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:17.740\nAnd In order for this to complete\nit's going to give us a warning.\n\n370\n00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:23.730\nIt says please restart the DHCP server for\nthe restored database to take effect.\n\n371\n00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:28.590\nSo I just wanna note that you don't have\nto fully restart the computer especially\n\n372\n00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.880\nif it's during production hours.\n\n373\n00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.890\nWhat you can do is stop and restart\nthat service right here from PowerShell.\n\n374\n00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.190\nSo let's go ahead and do that as well.\n\n375\n00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:40.870\nSo if we just I want to show you\nthat we can get the service first so\n\n376\n00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:45.970\nget dash service and\nwill check on it to see the status.\n\n377\n00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:47.850\nI just wanted to show you\nthat you can do that.\n\n378\n00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:52.950\nThat is going to be DHCP server\nis the name of our service here.\n\n379\n00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.776\nGet dash service DHCP.\n\n380\n00:22:57.776 --> 00:23:00.468\nServer.\n\n381\n00:23:07.158 --> 00:23:13.090\nOkay, this is going to\nshow you the status.\n\n382\n00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:14.566\nCurrently, we can see that it's running.\n\n383\n00:23:14.566 --> 00:23:19.240\nSo, what we wanna do is to go ahead and\nstop that service and then, restart it.\n\n384\n00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.200\nSo were just gonna go ahead and\ntype in stop And\n\n385\n00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:27.880\nthen this is going to be our -Service,\nand then it's that DhcpServer.\n\n386\n00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.547\nAnd nothing really happens to much here so\nwhat were gonna do,\n\n387\n00:23:32.547 --> 00:23:35.960\nit doesn't give you any kind of\nyou know notifications so again,\n\n388\n00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.518\nwe're just gonna type in the Get-Service\nand see the status of it.\n\n389\n00:23:39.518 --> 00:23:43.530\nAnd you can see right here that it has in\nfact been stopped so, we're good to go but\n\n390\n00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:46.200\nwe do need to go ahead and\nrestart that service.\n\n391\n00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.440\nSo what we're gonna type here is,\nStart and\n\n392\n00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:55.540\nthis is going to be our service, and\nthis going to be our Dhcpserver.\n\n393\n00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:02.470\nAnd if you just want to go ahead and\nverify that, it gives us a notification,\n\n394\n00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:05.450\nhey we're waiting for\nthis DHCP server to start.\n\n395\n00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.102\nAnd in [INAUDIBLE] we had that\nlittle ancient clock ticking and\n\n396\n00:24:08.102 --> 00:24:09.870\nthat's what we were waiting for there.\n\n397\n00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:15.992\nSo, in order to check our work, I think\nthe last step we should do here is to go\n\n398\n00:24:15.992 --> 00:24:21.559\nback into the console and\nwe'll hit action and then refresh and see.\n\n399\n00:24:21.559 --> 00:24:25.302\nYes, that brought my\nreservation back in and\n\n400\n00:24:25.302 --> 00:24:29.158\nwe can verify this should\nbe our printer here.\n\n401\n00:24:29.158 --> 00:24:30.624\nAll right.\n\n402\n00:24:33.023 --> 00:24:35.810\nAnd we can see that yes,\nthis is our training room printer.\n\n403\n00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:38.840\nIt did restore successfully.\n\n404\n00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.860\nSo that is something you wanna do,\nagain always check your backups,\n\n405\n00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:45.250\nmake sure you're bringing\nthe correct information back in, and\n\n406\n00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.380\nthat's just the beginning\nhere with PowerShell.\n\n407\n00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.210\nThere's so much more you can do.\n\n408\n00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:53.746\nPlease feel free to just really play\naround within this environment to make\n\n409\n00:24:53.746 --> 00:24:55.839\nyour lives easier in the long run.\n\n410\n00:24:55.839 --> 00:24:58.116\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nCherokee, well thank you for\n\n411\n00:24:58.116 --> 00:25:01.410\nshowing us that the PowerShell\nis really powerful.\n\n412\n00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:05.350\nAnything that we can do in\nthe graphical user interface and\n\n413\n00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.190\nthat management console.\n\n414\n00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:11.290\nCherokee also showed us that we can do\nthat using of course the PowerShell, and\n\n415\n00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:14.910\nthat's a thing that we are all going\nto have a gravity towards, and\n\n416\n00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:16.500\nit's really a choice, right?\n\n417\n00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.189\nMicrosoft is saying,\nhere is the more powerful way,\n\n418\n00:25:19.189 --> 00:25:22.553\nhere's the way we can get a lot more done,\na lot more efficiently.\n\n419\n00:25:22.553 --> 00:25:26.240\nSo, server administrators are gonna\nhave to be able to to do that and\n\n420\n00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.980\nso, Cherokee showed us a simple management\nand using just some PowerShell commands.\n\n421\n00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.851\nThe more often you use it, the better it's\ngonna be cuz you're gonna get used to it\n\n422\n00:25:33.851 --> 00:25:35.236\nand that's the way they want you to go.\n\n423\n00:25:35.236 --> 00:25:37.400\nSo, thank you also for watching.\n\n424\n00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.940\nThat's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n425\n00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.920\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n426\n00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:43.910\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n427\n00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:46.284\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Windows Server 101 shows.\n\n428\n00:25:46.284 -->

Cherokee mentions the different types of name resolution available to Windows Clients: DNS, HOSTS and LMHOSTS files and WINS.  She turns her attention onto describing form and function of the FQDN, Fully Qualified Domain Name and the DNS resolution process from the client. Lastly, she demonstrates of the powershell and command line utilities can be used to discover DNC functionality for a client computer.",

[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.910\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.036\nYou're watching\nthe Windows Server 101 show.\n\n6\n00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:22.780\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\ntoday we'll take a look at managing DNS.\n\n7\n00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.100\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be Mrs.\nCherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.650\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.220\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.360\nSo, when we talk about managing DNS,\nI wanna kind of broaden that idea, and\n\n11\n00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.060\nnot just utilising the domain name system,\n\n12\n00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.540\nlet's go have a think about,\nlet's take a step back further.\n\n13\n00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.870\nAnd note that there are additional methods\nin which we can perform additional\n\n14\n00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.940\nresolution.\n\n15\n00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.430\nSo we have the host file,\nthe LM host file, a little outdated there,\n\n16\n00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.700\nas well as WINS, so our\nWindows Internet naming system service.\n\n17\n00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.190\nAnd that's gonna be outdated as well.\n\n18\n00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.150\nThere might be particular use cases for\nthat.\n\n19\n00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.240\nBut, the majority of this conversation\nshould be focused centric around DNS\n\n20\n00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.600\nbecause, that's what the majority and\nthe internet is using today.\n\n21\n00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.170\nSo if we can take a look at my screen,\nI wanna start with a simple concept,\n\n22\n00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.020\nsomething called an FQDN which stands for\n\n23\n00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.910\nFully, if I can say it correctly\nFully Qualified Domain Name.\n\n24\n00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.858\nNow, if you're wondering how to go\nahead and get that information,\n\n25\n00:01:24.858 --> 00:01:27.443\nyou can go ahead and\npull up your system page,\n\n26\n00:01:27.443 --> 00:01:31.119\nwhich you can navigate there either\nthrough the control panel or\n\n27\n00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.504\nWindows key pause/break button if\nyou're on a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n\n28\n00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:39.400\nBut in this situation,\nI'm not connected to a domain.\n\n29\n00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.030\nI'm just simply noted here as\nbeing part of a work group.\n\n30\n00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.950\nYou can see my computer\nname which is DESKTOP and\n\n31\n00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.270\nthen we have just that\nstandard naming convention.\n\n32\n00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.960\nBut if I were in fact,\nadhering to a proper naming convention,\n\n33\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.450\nthat could also be noted as my host name.\n\n34\n00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.680\nAnd then if I were joined to a domain,\n\n35\n00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.730\nmy fully qualified domain\nname would be appended.\n\n36\n00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.638\nSo let me break that down for you and\nactually show you what that means.\n\n37\n00:02:05.638 --> 00:02:10.748\nSo if we go back to my diagram\nhere I have a particular fully\n\n38\n00:02:10.748 --> 00:02:17.669\nqualified domain name right here,\nso I have ronniepc.lab.itpro.tv so,\n\n39\n00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:22.220\nwhen we take a look,\nlet's start here at the top.\n\n40\n00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.280\nBut I know I'm on the right-hand\nside of this particular\n\n41\n00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.580\nfully qualified domain name.\n\n42\n00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.980\nSo when I say the top here,\nthis little dot,\n\n43\n00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.300\nthis period is going to be\nrepresenting our root DNS server.\n\n44\n00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.440\nSo our root servers,\nthere's actually 13 of them.\n\n45\n00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.320\nThey're spread out throughout the world.\n\n46\n00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.530\nThat doesn't mean that there are only\n13 machines that are performing.\n\n47\n00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.750\nThis is very high level resolution.\n\n48\n00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.300\nThere's actually, let me go ahead and\nshow you a link here.\n\n49\n00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.530\nFor each one of these, and\nthey're listed A through M.\n\n50\n00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.040\nAnd if I scroll down,\nyou can see a high level map here but\n\n51\n00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.050\nit's also showing mirrors.\n\n52\n00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.080\nAnd it goes A down here all\nthe way across through M.\n\n53\n00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.690\nAnd there's detailed information and\nthis website is just root-servers.org.\n\n54\n00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.980\nAnd there are five different sites\nthat are gonna be supporting that\n\n55\n00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.790\none particular server and you've got\nindividuals from across the world.\n\n56\n00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.570\nWe're talking governmental entities,\nuniversities, and\n\n57\n00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.940\nthey're supporting and\nmaintaining this infrastructure,\n\n58\n00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.640\nbecause essentially without it this\nis how the internet is working.\n\n59\n00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.910\nI don't go around memorizing IP addresses.\n\n60\n00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.980\nAnd I don't know I'm\nassuming you don't either.\n\n61\n00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.751\nWe remember things typically in\na human fashion like Amazon.com,\n\n62\n00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:40.010\nor CNN.com not the actual IP addresses.\n\n63\n00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.200\nSo what DNS performs for\nus is that actual resolution, and\n\n64\n00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.920\nmaps those hosts names,\nthe fully qualified domain names\n\n65\n00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.250\nto the IP addresses so\nwe don't have to remember all of that.\n\n66\n00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.310\nSo here we have our root servers.\n\n67\n00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.890\nWe'll come back and talk a little\nbit more about these as well, but\n\n68\n00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.440\nI want you to understand that concept.\n\n69\n00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.850\nAnd as we continue we're still\ngoing here from right to left.\n\n70\n00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:12.330\nSo if we look at .tv, so .tv is actually\na TLD, which is called a top level domain.\n\n71\n00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.690\nAnd it's kind of funny we started out\nwith .com, what was that, commercial.\n\n72\n00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.268\nWe have, it started with.org for\nwas it non-profit organizations and\n\n73\n00:04:22.268 --> 00:04:28.304\nwe've seen the list expand and\nbranch out here, .gov, .mil for military,\n\n74\n00:04:28.304 --> 00:04:34.812\nit's kind of interesting, though, but\nfor ours, for the .tv, for usually the.\n\n75\n00:04:34.812 --> 00:04:40.612\nThe two character top level domains\nare for countries, like .uk.\n\n76\n00:04:40.612 --> 00:04:47.190\nAnd tv stands for Tuvalu, and\neven ones like bit.ly, the .ly for Libya.\n\n77\n00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.880\nSo you're actually gonna be\nsupporting that country if you\n\n78\n00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.890\nare selecting a top level domain there.\n\n79\n00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.470\nSo that's kind of cool.\n\n80\n00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.480\nBut going even further down,\nor more over to the left.\n\n81\n00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.950\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n82\n00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.440\nWell, the next particular topic here\nwe have is going to be our domain.\n\n83\n00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.025\nAnd it's IT pro, so and\nif you guys recall, Ronnie had showed\n\n84\n00:05:11.025 --> 00:05:16.355\nus the symbolic triangles that Microsoft\nuses to help signify a domain.\n\n85\n00:05:16.355 --> 00:05:19.185\nAnd I didn't put them on the other,\nthe top level domains, but\n\n86\n00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:21.725\nI just wanted to kind of\nincorporate that as well.\n\n87\n00:05:21.725 --> 00:05:24.665\nHere we have ITPro, right?\n\n88\n00:05:24.665 --> 00:05:29.375\nSo remember we had said that within\nyour organization you can have child\n\n89\n00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:30.335\ndomains as well.\n\n90\n00:05:30.335 --> 00:05:33.970\nSo let's say we had a child\ndomain I know we used to.\n\n91\n00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.470\nI don't know if we do anymore but\nwe have one called lab.\n\n92\n00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.210\nSo we have a lab okay.\n\n93\n00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.650\nIf we move further over\nthat was our sub domain\n\n94\n00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.720\nthat's going to be to the left\nof our actual domain.\n\n95\n00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.000\nAnd within that particular domain\nI can see Ronnie's computer.\n\n96\n00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.030\nIs that your computer, Ronnie?\n\n97\n00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.360\n&gt;&gt; Sure, why not.\n\n98\n00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.040\n&gt;&gt; So I see Ronnie's PC\nlisted within that domain.\n\n99\n00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.185\nSo this server for trying our lab domain,\n\n100\n00:06:02.185 --> 00:06:06.235\nis going to be authoritative for\nthis particular PC right here.\n\n101\n00:06:06.235 --> 00:06:07.515\nRonnie's PC.\n\n102\n00:06:07.515 --> 00:06:10.025\nSo you can see it kind of how that works\n\n103\n00:06:11.345 --> 00:06:14.690\nby using the fully\nqualified domain name here.\n\n104\n00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.190\nNow, it's not going to be exactly\nthe same for every situation.\n\n105\n00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.820\nAnd this particular show is\ngonna introduce the topic and\n\n106\n00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.980\ntalk about some of the fundamentals.\n\n107\n00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.240\nBut we have like three chapters within\nBryan's book that will expand upon DNS,\n\n108\n00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.820\nbecause it's such an important topic.\n\n109\n00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.100\nSo I do wanna point out\nanother example here.\n\n110\n00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.550\nFor instance,\nlet's say we have www.Microsoft.com.\n\n111\n00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.800\nWell, how does that really work?\n\n112\n00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.440\nWell, if we were talking about the route\nbeing at the very, the period.\n\n113\n00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.310\nThe period still exists there, we were\nnot normally typing that in to the to\n\n114\n00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.270\nthe address bar within our browsers,\nbut just know that it does exist.\n\n115\n00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:59.170\nWe start the root which is going to\npoint us to the .com domain and the .com\n\n116\n00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:04.670\ndomain is not authoritative for this\nparticular fully qualified domain name so\n\n117\n00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:09.600\nyou'll go ahead and send that query\nto the server that is authoritative.\n\n118\n00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.530\nAnd if you don't know what that\nword means don't worry about it,\n\n119\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.270\nI'll talk about it in a second here.\n\n120\n00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.880\nBut Microsoft, this DNS server\nis going to be authoritative for\n\n121\n00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.060\nthis particular domain.\n\n122\n00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.280\nAnd there are a couple different\nways we can set this up.\n\n123\n00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.820\nBut typically if you think\nabout Microsoft.com.\n\n124\n00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.550\nThey don't have just one web server\nwaiting within their domain to respond to\n\n125\n00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.240\nthese requests.\n\n126\n00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.190\nIt's probably thousands, and I only\nhave three pointing here on my diagram.\n\n127\n00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.820\nBut they may have an alias for\n\n128\n00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.500\nthe www, which is stored in the resource\nrecords which we'll also talk about.\n\n129\n00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.480\nSo that's just an idea of\nhow the structure works and\n\n130\n00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.250\nhow it's really important to\nunderstand that structure and\n\n131\n00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.740\nhas it relates to a fully\nqualified domain name.\n\n132\n00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:52.970\nAlright.\n\n133\n00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.660\nNow What's the actual process here?\n\n134\n00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.162\nWhat's happening when we're utilizing DNS?\n\n135\n00:07:58.162 --> 00:08:02.945\nSo if we take a look at this diagram,\nthis is an example of an internal request,\n\n136\n00:08:02.945 --> 00:08:04.183\nan internal query.\n\n137\n00:08:04.183 --> 00:08:11.452\nSo, Let's say this is my laptop right here\nand I wanna go to a particular server.\n\n138\n00:08:11.452 --> 00:08:16.547\nFor instance,\nhere I wanna access server101.ITPRO.TV.\n\n139\n00:08:16.547 --> 00:08:21.234\nWell, the first thing that happens\nis going to be my machine,\n\n140\n00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:27.200\nmy local machine, my laptop is going to\nbe checking to see if I ever been there.\n\n141\n00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.690\nBecause my computer stores that\ninformation something called cache.\n\n142\n00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:34.520\nSo this is actually the location\nin which that cache is stored.\n\n143\n00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:41.870\nSo If I've been to the server\n101.ITProTV within a reasonable\n\n144\n00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:48.090\namount of time because each one of\nthe cache can become stale and get old.\n\n145\n00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.170\nAnd we don't want that to happen.\n\n146\n00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.617\nSo we'll set TTL's time to lives.\n\n147\n00:08:52.617 --> 00:08:56.570\n[LAUGH] Time to lives, anyway,\nignore the bad grammar.\n\n148\n00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.800\nBut the concept here is that\nIt'll eventually time out so\n\n149\n00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.480\nthat if this server's IP\naddress ever changed,\n\n150\n00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.930\nthen I wouldn't have that stale or\nold record on my local machine.\n\n151\n00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.710\nSo I'm always going to check\nmy local machine first.\n\n152\n00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:11.530\nIf I don't have that entry,\n\n153\n00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.920\nthen what I'm going to do is I'm gonna\ncall out to my local DNS server.\n\n154\n00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.092\nSo I'm gonna say hey, DNS server.\n\n155\n00:09:18.092 --> 00:09:23.174\nDo you have the IP address for\nserver Or one.ITPRO.TV?\n\n156\n00:09:23.174 --> 00:09:28.081\nAnd then that server is going to go ahead\nand respond without particular IP address\n\n157\n00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:32.010\nthus allowing me to communicate\ndirectly to that's server.\n\n158\n00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.765\nBecause that's how computers communicate\nwith IP addresses, we use host names,\n\n159\n00:09:35.765 --> 00:09:38.355\ncomputers use IP addresses.\n\n160\n00:09:38.355 --> 00:09:41.505\nLet me go back to that term authoritative.\n\n161\n00:09:41.505 --> 00:09:45.155\nSo, every domain, whether it be\ninternal like we see on this diagram,\n\n162\n00:09:45.155 --> 00:09:49.810\nprivate, versus even public domains.\n\n163\n00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.780\nWe have to have an authoritative server.\n\n164\n00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:56.550\nThat server is going to be responsible for\nresponding to the queries for\n\n165\n00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.110\nthat particular domain.\n\n166\n00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.170\nSo here this is the authoritative\nserver for ITPRO all right.\n\n167\n00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:08.870\nBut what happens if we want to get the IP\naddress For someone outside of our domain.\n\n168\n00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:09.670\nOkay.\n\n169\n00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.880\nSo let's take a look at how that happens.\n\n170\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.889\nAnd I might need to\nzoom out slightly here.\n\n171\n00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.450\nHere, I have that same network down\nin the bottom right hand corner.\n\n172\n00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:27.810\nAnd I'm asking, what is the IP\naddress of www.microsoft.com?\n\n173\n00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.090\nSo maybe I've never been to microsoft.com.\n\n174\n00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:34.390\nMy local machine, my laptop doesn't\nhave that information stored in cash.\n\n175\n00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:40.260\nSo what it does, is it's going to go ahead\nand reach out to my specified DNS server.\n\n176\n00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:46.510\nSo here, I have my authoritative\nserver for this particular domain.\n\n177\n00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:50.920\nBut this particular server\nhas never had anyone request,\n\n178\n00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.000\nbecause let's think about that for\na second.\n\n179\n00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.930\nJust as client side\ncomputers can store and\n\n180\n00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.400\ncache information servers can store and\ncache information as well.\n\n181\n00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.720\nAnd not trying to give you whiplash, but\nI do want you to see this concept here.\n\n182\n00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.390\nSo let's say I'm asking\nthat same question,\n\n183\n00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.950\nwhat's the IP address of Microsoft.com.\n\n184\n00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:15.600\nWell, maybe Ronnie's queried and\nhas been to Microsoft.com before.\n\n185\n00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.160\nIf that were the case, and that IP\naddress was already stored in the server.\n\n186\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.930\nThen, that DNS server could just\nrespond with that IP address and\n\n187\n00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.520\nnever even have to go out to the internet.\n\n188\n00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:32.500\nSo that's gonna save time and make my\nqueries a little more efficient there.\n\n189\n00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.000\nBut, let's say we've never\nbeen to microsoft.com.\n\n190\n00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.390\nWhat happens in this situation?\n\n191\n00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:44.190\nWell, a couple things could happen and\nwe're gonna start pretty basic here.\n\n192\n00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:48.100\nBut I want you to understand the types\nalso of queries that we can send out.\n\n193\n00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:53.610\nSo I'm going to have my authoritative\nserver for this domain say, look I\n\n194\n00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.950\ndon't know this particular fully qualified\ndomain name and how to get there.\n\n195\n00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.510\nCan you help me out here?\n\n196\n00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:03.050\nSo, let's think back to those A through M,\nthose roots servers.\n\n197\n00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.960\nSo, your root servers are at the top\nof the food chain, so to speak,\n\n198\n00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.810\nso let's go there to help us\nfind our particular IP address.\n\n199\n00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:16.610\nSo we're gonna query one of those servers\nand they're gonna respond with, look, I\n\n200\n00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:20.330\ndon't know how to access that information,\nbut I know someone who can help you.\n\n201\n00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:24.130\nAnd they'll give us the information for\nthe dot com domain,\n\n202\n00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.730\nlike I had mentioned a few moments ago,\n\n203\n00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:30.570\nand the dot com domain says I don't\nhave that specific detailed information.\n\n204\n00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.370\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\npass you off onto Microsoft.\n\n205\n00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:37.020\nSo you can see multiple iterations\nof that query transpiring here.\n\n206\n00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.890\nSo that's where we get this\nterm iterative queries.\n\n207\n00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.790\nSo typically,\n\n208\n00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:47.100\niterative queries are gonna be happening\nfrom DNS server to DNS server.\n\n209\n00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.600\nWhere as recursive queries,\n\n210\n00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:54.160\nare gonna be happening typically\nfrom clients to DNS server.\n\n211\n00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.100\nAnd what recursive means is\nthat this guy right here,\n\n212\n00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:02.740\nthis IT Pro DNS server is on the hook for\nresponding to this client.\n\n213\n00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:07.640\nSo they're taking, I usually think of\nthe term recursive, responsibility and\n\n214\n00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.640\nkind of associate those two R's, but\nwhatever may help you in this situation.\n\n215\n00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:16.760\nSo eventually, I'm going to get\nthat IP address of microsoft.com.\n\n216\n00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.860\nAnd then what?\n\n217\n00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.490\nWell, this guy is gonna go ahead and\n\n218\n00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:22.780\nretain that information,\nput it into their zone, their database.\n\n219\n00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.770\nAnd we'll talk about that as well.\n\n220\n00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:30.110\nBut now, if someone else on this internal\nnetwork were to go to microsoft.com,\n\n221\n00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:33.260\nagain, you would see\nthe server cache happening and\n\n222\n00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.420\nit would be a more rapid movement there.\n\n223\n00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:44.840\nWe're also gonna be talking\na little bit about forwarding and\n\n224\n00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.030\nconditional forwarding.\n\n225\n00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.150\nSo I'm just gonna introduce you\nto this topic right now but\n\n226\n00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:54.660\nlet's say I set up a forwarder,\nconditional forwarder,\n\n227\n00:13:54.660 --> 00:14:00.100\nand this end user says hey, I wanna\nfind someone within the Contoso Domain.\n\n228\n00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:06.490\nSo, instead of going through this entire\niterated process, I can say look, anytime\n\n229\n00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:12.610\nsomebody from my domain is requesting\nan IP address from the Contoso domain.\n\n230\n00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:17.670\nI'm just gonna go ahead, and forward\nyou directly to the Contoso DNS server.\n\n231\n00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.874\nSo, it's going to expedite,\nthat process as well.\n\n232\n00:14:19.874 --> 00:14:24.373\nAnd we'll take a look where you could\ngo ahead, and do that, and so forth.\n\n233\n00:14:24.373 --> 00:14:25.852\nAll right, what's next here?\n\n234\n00:14:25.852 --> 00:14:27.337\nSo we looked at our route severs.\n\n235\n00:14:27.337 --> 00:14:30.301\nWe talked about recursive and\niterative, so\n\n236\n00:14:30.301 --> 00:14:35.606\nwe've also talked about authoritative,\nbut let's kind of shift gears here and\n\n237\n00:14:35.606 --> 00:14:39.160\ntake a look at some thing\ncalled the Host file.\n\n238\n00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.110\nSo, If we take a look at my screen here,\nI'm just going to go ahead and,\n\n239\n00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:46.550\nthe easiest way to do this,\nis to just start typing in Notepad, and\n\n240\n00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.790\nthen right click, and\nrun it as an administrator.\n\n241\n00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:53.470\nThis is going to allow me to go ahead and\n\n242\n00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:57.320\nopen up our host file to\nbe able to modify it.\n\n243\n00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.120\nAnd I'll talk a little bit about that.\n\n244\n00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.700\nSo if we go to open, now our particular.\n\n245\n00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.850\nSo, this was just something that\nI was playing around with, but\n\n246\n00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:12.750\nnormally your host file, if you follow\nthis local path here under your windows,\n\n247\n00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:17.360\nsystem 32 driver, and etc folder,\nyou won't see anything.\n\n248\n00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.130\nSo, you need to change\nthat to all files and.\n\n249\n00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.990\nUsually, then,\nyou'll be able to see that host file, but\n\n250\n00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.050\nI'm going to go ahead and\nopen this up right now.\n\n251\n00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.330\nThis is what it looks like.\n\n252\n00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:35.662\nLet me try to zoom in a little bit for\nyou, a little bit too much.\n\n253\n00:15:35.662 --> 00:15:36.954\nThis is kind of interesting.\n\n254\n00:15:36.954 --> 00:15:39.472\nThis host file has been around for\na very long time.\n\n255\n00:15:39.472 --> 00:15:41.019\nI don't even know,\n\n256\n00:15:41.019 --> 00:15:46.570\nit probably came out with a very early\nversion of the operating systems,\n\n257\n00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:52.857\nand what I'm doing here is I'm actually\ngoing to be overwriting the DNS process.\n\n258\n00:15:52.857 --> 00:15:55.516\nSo I'm overwriting that local cache and\n\n259\n00:15:55.516 --> 00:16:00.210\nI'm overwriting whatever my\nDNS server has to offer me.\n\n260\n00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.439\nSimply by having some\nentries within this document.\n\n261\n00:16:03.439 --> 00:16:09.177\nSo here I have two different examples,\nhere I see my home address,\n\n262\n00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:16.900\nmy looped back address of 127.0.0.1 my\nlocal host for IPv4, as well as IPv6.\n\n263\n00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:22.733\nSo let's say I wanted to go in here and\ncreate another entry.\n\n264\n00:16:22.733 --> 00:16:28.910\nI could type in 127.0.1.1 and\n\n265\n00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:33.782\ntype in www.facebook.com.\n\n266\n00:16:33.782 --> 00:16:38.216\nSo what I'm doing is I'm telling basically\nI'm trying to block someone from\n\n267\n00:16:38.216 --> 00:16:40.000\ngoing to Facebook right here.\n\n268\n00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.450\nBecause that's not the correct\nIP address for facebook.com.\n\n269\n00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.420\nSo if someone were to type\nfacebook.com in to their browser then\n\n270\n00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:52.133\ntheoretically it should and it had been\nthat way for a very long time Ronnie.\n\n271\n00:16:52.133 --> 00:16:56.938\nBut this morning I was playing around\nin here because some of the browsers\n\n272\n00:16:56.938 --> 00:17:01.710\nnowadays are not actually looking\nat this host file anymore.\n\n273\n00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:07.050\nBecause attackers have used this\nas a vector for malware so often,\n\n274\n00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:11.800\nand admins really don't use that much,\nthis method of name resolution.\n\n275\n00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:16.600\nSo, they see it more as\na security risk to enable this\n\n276\n00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:21.120\nparticular functionality which is kind of\ninteresting because for a very long time.\n\n277\n00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.534\nAnd as I was an admin running really\nonly legitimately ever had to use\n\n278\n00:17:25.534 --> 00:17:27.867\nthis type of name resolution once.\n\n279\n00:17:27.867 --> 00:17:32.503\nAnd that was, Was because the customer\nhad incorrectly registered\n\n280\n00:17:32.503 --> 00:17:35.395\ntheir domain name with the registrar.\n\n281\n00:17:35.395 --> 00:17:38.295\nLike there was a typo whenever\nthey filled out the paperwork.\n\n282\n00:17:38.295 --> 00:17:42.975\nSo until they were able to contact that\nregistrar, that CA certificate authority,\n\n283\n00:17:42.975 --> 00:17:44.960\nto fix that information.\n\n284\n00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.920\nWe had to manually override that.\n\n285\n00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.814\nSo just be aware of that,\n\n286\n00:17:48.814 --> 00:17:53.600\na lot of people will consider this\na way to manually override but\n\n287\n00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:58.864\ncertain browsers are now compensating for\nthat potential malware.\n\n288\n00:17:58.864 --> 00:18:02.110\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee, it looks like you added in\none to many zeros inside of your 127.\n\n289\n00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\nthat's not gonna work anyways.\n\n290\n00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.814\n&gt;&gt; And also to make this work,\ndon't forget, you need\n\n291\n00:18:07.814 --> 00:18:10.803\nto remove that pound sign in front of it-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n292\n00:18:10.803 --> 00:18:13.852\nthe syntax here it really doesn't matter.\n\n293\n00:18:13.852 --> 00:18:18.688\nWhat you really have to focus on\nis at least if you have one space\n\n294\n00:18:18.688 --> 00:18:22.330\nbetween the address and\nthe domain name here.\n\n295\n00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.130\nSo as long as you have one space,\nthat's really all it's looking for.\n\n296\n00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:29.048\nYou don't even have to line it up With\neverything else there that's just to make\n\n297\n00:18:29.048 --> 00:18:31.800\nthings look a little bit pretty,\nnot too pretty there.\n\n298\n00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.900\nAnd you would just go ahead and file and\nsave that in order to make that change.\n\n299\n00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.330\nBut I'm not gonna go ahead and\n\n300\n00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:41.600\nsave that because maybe I do wanna\ngo to Facebook on this laptop.\n\n301\n00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.514\nSo that's gonna be your host file.\n\n302\n00:18:44.514 --> 00:18:46.462\nThe LM host file.\n\n303\n00:18:46.462 --> 00:18:48.664\nAnd let's talk about that for\na second okay?\n\n304\n00:18:48.664 --> 00:18:51.940\nLet's go back again,\nI told you host was old school.\n\n305\n00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:56.010\nBut bringing it back even further,\nsomething called LM host, which is gonna\n\n306\n00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:00.808\nbe associated with our LAN Man, back\nin that older authentication mechanism.\n\n307\n00:19:00.808 --> 00:19:06.003\nWhat we were talking about utilizing\nnet bios names with our win servers.\n\n308\n00:19:06.003 --> 00:19:12.250\nSo win servers are going to be\nan alternative to a pre-DNS option.\n\n309\n00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.060\nSo pre-internet also.\n\n310\n00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:18.400\nSo if you think about, although the name\nimplies Windows internet naming system,\n\n311\n00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.580\nit's not used on the Internet.\n\n312\n00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:25.582\nSo it's gonna be use for local resolution\nif you're running a legacy system.\n\n313\n00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:29.740\nSo let me go ahead and\nlet me just show where you can see that.\n\n314\n00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.660\nIf we go full screen for a second, so\n\n315\n00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.650\nbehind my head here, if we pull up\nnetwork and sharing center on my client.\n\n316\n00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.860\nAnd then on the left-hand side\nselect change adapter settings.\n\n317\n00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:46.749\nAnd then when I go into my IP version\nfour settings underneath this adapter,\n\n318\n00:19:46.749 --> 00:19:49.320\nlet me zoom in slightly.\n\n319\n00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.720\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nselect that and hit Properties.\n\n320\n00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:58.030\nAnd down here at the bottom is where\nI can add my DNS server IP addresses.\n\n321\n00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.850\nSo currently I'm obtaining my DNS\nserver address automatically.\n\n322\n00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.482\nSo I'm just getting my DNS\ninformation from our ISP.\n\n323\n00:20:05.482 --> 00:20:08.843\nBut if I had a specified DNS\nserver that I wanted to use,\n\n324\n00:20:08.843 --> 00:20:11.160\nI can go ahead and input that here.\n\n325\n00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.850\nThere are two fields, two boxes,\nby default because we should always\n\n326\n00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:19.660\nhave at least two DNS servers\navailable within a network.\n\n327\n00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.960\nBut I can add DNS servers\non my advance tab.\n\n328\n00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:27.411\nSo let's take a look at that advance\ntab and see what we have here.\n\n329\n00:20:27.411 --> 00:20:29.100\nLet me just get that out of the way.\n\n330\n00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:32.410\nHere's my DNS tab.\n\n331\n00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.482\nThis is where I would add\nadditional DNS IP addresses.\n\n332\n00:20:35.482 --> 00:20:39.613\nAnd then I could go ahead and\nset the priority utilizing these\n\n333\n00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:43.906\narrows on the right hand side and\nhitting this add button here.\n\n334\n00:20:43.906 --> 00:20:46.153\nNow if we look at this wins button,\n\n335\n00:20:46.153 --> 00:20:50.816\nwe can see here that I currently\ndon't have anything designated here.\n\n336\n00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:56.131\nMost of you will not, but if your IT\ndepartment should definitely clue you\n\n337\n00:20:56.131 --> 00:21:01.533\nin as to why you would want to have that\nenabled versus not because typically\n\n338\n00:21:01.533 --> 00:21:07.215\nwe're gonna even be disabling net Bios\nnames if we're not using those there.\n\n339\n00:21:07.215 --> 00:21:13.035\nSo you also see your import,\nyour LM host files as well.\n\n340\n00:21:13.035 --> 00:21:14.711\nSo you can see how they're all related,\nbut\n\n341\n00:21:14.711 --> 00:21:17.936\nthat's not really something you'll be\nseeing on a production environment today.\n\n342\n00:21:19.617 --> 00:21:23.611\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, we did have somebody\nin the chat also mention that as for\n\n343\n00:21:23.611 --> 00:21:26.105\nthe host file or even the LM host file.\n\n344\n00:21:26.105 --> 00:21:29.912\nRemember that if you do try to save this\nbecause you're trying to do some type of\n\n345\n00:21:29.912 --> 00:21:32.235\nmanipulation, just like\nwhat you were shown.\n\n346\n00:21:32.235 --> 00:21:34.538\nTo make sure that as you save it,\nit can't save with an extension.\n\n347\n00:21:34.538 --> 00:21:36.350\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nit's gonna want to go ahead and save.\n\n348\n00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:40.070\nLike you saw guys, in my window,\nit saved it with a .txt extension.\n\n349\n00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.857\nYou don't want it to have an extension.\n\n350\n00:21:41.857 --> 00:21:45.490\nIt should be a file with no\nextension there for that host file.\n\n351\n00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:46.030\nSo, thank you.\n\n352\n00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.144\nGood point for that.\n\n353\n00:21:48.144 --> 00:21:53.165\nNow, let's take a look here at\nPowerShell has, and we've been stressing\n\n354\n00:21:53.165 --> 00:21:58.997\nPowerShell throughout this series, there's\na lot that we can do within PowerShell.\n\n355\n00:21:58.997 --> 00:22:02.562\nBut I kinda wanna give an example and just\nnote there are a lot of different tools\n\n356\n00:22:02.562 --> 00:22:04.680\nthat we can use when\nwe're talking about DNS.\n\n357\n00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.531\nWe're not gonna be able to get\nto all of them within this show.\n\n358\n00:22:07.531 --> 00:22:11.460\nBut at first let's go ahead and\n\n359\n00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:15.548\ntype in get-DnsClientCache.\n\n360\n00:22:17.835 --> 00:22:22.955\nNow what we're gonna be seeing is a\ndisplay of the cache on my local machine,\n\n361\n00:22:22.955 --> 00:22:24.840\nlike I was talking about.\n\n362\n00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.730\nSo any kind of mappings\nthat I have stored here.\n\n363\n00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.489\nMy host names,\nmy fully qualified domain names too\n\n364\n00:22:31.489 --> 00:22:34.641\nmy IP addresses are gonna be\nstored in this local machine.\n\n365\n00:22:34.641 --> 00:22:37.520\nSo I can see that here within PowerShell.\n\n366\n00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:42.100\nNow have I ever been yeah I've\nbeen to Microsoft okay to log on.\n\n367\n00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.950\nBut let's say I don't see\nsomething like CNN on here.\n\n368\n00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.752\nSo, if I were to go ahead and\n\n369\n00:22:48.752 --> 00:22:54.590\nping www.cnn.com and hit Enter.\n\n370\n00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:57.820\nSo now I hadn't been to cnn.com before but\n\n371\n00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:03.666\nbecause of ping I'm forcing this process\nhere and I can see I do have my reply.\n\n372\n00:23:03.666 --> 00:23:09.151\nSo if I go back and\ncheck my get-DNSclient cache again,\n\n373\n00:23:09.151 --> 00:23:15.351\nI should see, and you can see\nthese entries here for CNN.com.\n\n374\n00:23:15.351 --> 00:23:20.805\nSo that means that this information\nis now stored within my cache.\n\n375\n00:23:20.805 --> 00:23:24.869\nThat's not the only utility that can\nperform a similar function like this.\n\n376\n00:23:24.869 --> 00:23:30.359\nSo if we go ahead even taking it back\na little further and pull up a command\n\n377\n00:23:30.359 --> 00:23:36.380\nprompt, you still have that ability\nhere to go ahead and do that as well.\n\n378\n00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:41.870\nSo within the command prompt you're\ngonna be typing in the command tool.\n\n379\n00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.880\nSo let's go ahead and type in ipconfig.\n\n380\n00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:50.784\nSpace /displayDNS, I'm making\n\n381\n00:23:50.784 --> 00:23:55.655\nup my own commands here okay.\n\n382\n00:23:55.655 --> 00:23:59.694\nSo a little bit different\nof an output here but\n\n383\n00:23:59.694 --> 00:24:05.558\nyou can see that it's going to\nshow you that information as well.\n\n384\n00:24:05.558 --> 00:24:07.222\nLet' see.\n\n385\n00:24:07.222 --> 00:24:09.424\nLet's pick another website here.\n\n386\n00:24:09.424 --> 00:24:11.440\nMaybe like Pandora.com.\n\n387\n00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:15.143\nSo again if I were to go ahead and\n\n388\n00:24:15.143 --> 00:24:19.822\njust ping www.pandora.com.\n\n389\n00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.122\nOkay, I'm forcing this process.\n\n390\n00:24:23.122 --> 00:24:24.196\nI'm storing this now.\n\n391\n00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:28.990\nI can see this information 208.85.40.20.\n\n392\n00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:33.756\nAnd if I go ahead and\ndisplay my DNS again.\n\n393\n00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.290\nI should have Pandora\nin this list somewhere.\n\n394\n00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:44.500\nNow, the only caviatte to that would\nalso be to note, here's my pandora.com.\n\n395\n00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:50.710\nWould be to note that there are TTLs,\nlike we spoke about.\n\n396\n00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:56.490\nSo, it doesn't mean that if you don't see\na particular mapping within your cache,\n\n397\n00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:59.490\nit doesn't mean that, that computer\nhas never been to that site before.\n\n398\n00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:03.802\nIt means that, that record may have\nexceeded it's time to live and\n\n399\n00:25:03.802 --> 00:25:08.812\nit's just kind of being a little more\ndynamic and refreshing in that aspect.\n\n400\n00:25:08.812 --> 00:25:13.854\nWe do have additional tools that I\nwanna talk about like NS look up and\n\n401\n00:25:13.854 --> 00:25:18.904\nshow you how not only can we perform\nhostname to IP address queries.\n\n402\n00:25:18.904 --> 00:25:22.899\nBut also th reverse, but Ronnie I think\nwe are getting short on time for that,\n\n403\n00:25:22.899 --> 00:25:23.769\nwhat do you say?\n\n404\n00:25:23.769 --> 00:25:27.080\n&gt;&gt; yap there's no doubt that there\nis plenty to actually go and\n\n405\n00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:31.990\nsee more on DNS and we've just really\nintroduced at least the basic topics here.\n\n406\n00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:35.368\nOf understanding how the FQDN works,\nas well as the process and\n\n407\n00:25:35.368 --> 00:25:38.746\nhow we're gonna see the name\nresolution end up happening, But\n\n408\n00:25:38.746 --> 00:25:41.932\nthere's a lot more details but\nwe are running out of time for\n\n409\n00:25:41.932 --> 00:25:45.849\nthis particular episode, which means\nwe are going to go into a part two.\n\n410\n00:25:45.849 --> 00:25:49.368\nSo we're actually gonna save that for\nanother episode then.\n\n411\n00:25:49.368 --> 00:25:52.946\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n412\n00:25:52.946 --> 00:25:54.195\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n413\n00:25:54.195 --> 00:25:58.648\n&gt;&gt; Stay right here for\nmore Windows Server 101

[CROSSTALK]\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.058 --> 00:00:08.778\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:08.778 --> 00:00:15.670\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.100\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today we're\ntaking a look at Windows Server 101.\n\n7\n00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.770\nWe're specifically going into a part two,\n\n8\n00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.760\ntaking a look at client\nside name resolution.\n\n9\n00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.900\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be Ms.\nCherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.820\nCherokee, welcome back.\n\n11\n00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.610\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.480\nHow are you doing today?\n\n13\n00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.690\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Cherokee.\n\n14\n00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.026\nSo we've done a lot in our part one.\n\n15\n00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:35.576\nWhere are we picking up\ninside of part two here?\n\n16\n00:00:35.576 --> 00:00:40.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so in part one, we were taking\na look at a PowerShell commandlet where\n\n17\n00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.320\nwe can look within our PowerShell utility\nto look at that client side cache.\n\n18\n00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.400\nPowerShell is not the only tool\nthat we do have available for\n\n19\n00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.700\nthat client side\ntroubleshooting process as well.\n\n20\n00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.950\nSo something, I do wanna go ahead and\npull up PowerShell again.\n\n21\n00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:04.110\nAnd I wanna remind you that you can\nutilize older commands, that you\n\n22\n00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.100\nmight have used, and been more comfortable\nwith within PowerShell as well.\n\n23\n00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.000\nSo, one of the things I wanted\nto take a look at here was,\n\n24\n00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.360\nif we talk about ipconfig right.\n\n25\n00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.150\nSo, I see config as a tried,\nand true commands,\n\n26\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.870\nthat we may be familiar with already,\nand take a look at ipconfig\n\n27\n00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.270\nSpace /displaydns I think\nwe looked at this earlier.\n\n28\n00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.200\nThis is going to give us our\nrecords within our actual clients.\n\n29\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.000\nSo we're talking client side here.\n\n30\n00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.130\nNow Ronnie, whenever there's an issue\nwithin DNS you kind of have to have this\n\n31\n00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.410\ntrouble shooting process this methodology\nthat will help you determine.\n\n32\n00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.910\nif the issue lies on the client side,\nor if it's a server issue.\n\n33\n00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.278\nSo if there is one individual that's not\nable to resolve, then you might want and\n\n34\n00:01:54.278 --> 00:01:58.389\neveryone else on the network or on that\nparticular segment is working fine,\n\n35\n00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:02.590\nthen you might wanna isolate and look\nat more of these client side utilities.\n\n36\n00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.031\nWhereas if an entire portion\nof your network that and\n\n37\n00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:08.170\nyou find something in common.\n\n38\n00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.725\nAnd that particular variable that's common\nis going to be the DNS server then that's\n\n39\n00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:16.142\nwhen you kind of shift your\ntroubleshooting skills towards that\n\n40\n00:02:16.142 --> 00:02:16.660\nserver.\n\n41\n00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.196\nSo it could be something as\nsimple as an incorrect record\n\n42\n00:02:21.196 --> 00:02:26.540\nthat's stored here locally on\nthis machine within my cache.\n\n43\n00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.335\nSo if that's the case, I could simply\njust go ahead and type in ipconfig\n\n44\n00:02:31.335 --> 00:02:38.570\n/flushdns and what that's gonna do for\nme is just clear out my cache here.\n\n45\n00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.230\nIf I go ahead and\ntype properly that will help.\n\n46\n00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.750\nAnd you can see here, it says Successfully\nflushed the DNS Resolver Cache.\n\n47\n00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.610\nSo that's great.\n\n48\n00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.455\nBut on the server side,\n\n49\n00:02:52.455 --> 00:02:56.755\nif you think about what is the function\nof the server and then the cache.\n\n50\n00:02:56.755 --> 00:02:59.585\nRemember how we spoke about\nhow the servers also retain\n\n51\n00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:03.335\nthat information within their cache\nwhich helps speeds up that network?\n\n52\n00:03:03.335 --> 00:03:06.580\nSo instead of flushing out\nthe entire server cache and\n\n53\n00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.617\non the server side you'd want to go\nin granularly and if you suspect\n\n54\n00:03:10.617 --> 00:03:15.326\na particular issue with an IP address,\nmaybe a website has changed their IP.\n\n55\n00:03:15.326 --> 00:03:16.322\nThen you can go in and\n\n56\n00:03:16.322 --> 00:03:20.308\nchange that one, because you wouldn't\nwant to hurt yourself and work backwards\n\n57\n00:03:20.308 --> 00:03:25.140\nin that way of getting rid of everything\nthat that server's been working for there.\n\n58\n00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.110\nNow another core utility that you can\nuse within PowerShell or command prompt\n\n59\n00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.515\nis another oldie but goodie and\nthis one is going to be called nslookup.\n\n60\n00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.766\nSo nslookup actually has two different\nmodes, there's an interactive mode and\n\n61\n00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:44.070\na non interactive mode, so\njust by typing nslookup and hitting enter.\n\n62\n00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.360\nYou'll see this little carrot\nsymbol that appears and\n\n63\n00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.400\nthen you'll know at this point in\ntime I've entered interactive mode.\n\n64\n00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.795\nNot a huge difference here,\n\n65\n00:03:54.795 --> 00:04:00.580\nwe're establishing a connection\nwith that DNS server and I\n\n66\n00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.060\ncan use this interactive mode to submit a\nlot of queries to that particular server.\n\n67\n00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.152\nIf I was working rather rapidly within\nPowerShell or the command prompt,\n\n68\n00:04:11.152 --> 00:04:16.492\nand I just wanted to query one particular,\none particular resource record,\n\n69\n00:04:16.492 --> 00:04:22.270\nthen I could just go non-interactive mode,\nand I would just say like, nslook up.\n\n70\n00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:29.173\nAnd then go ahead and type in the host's\nname, so here I could say plabdm01 and\n\n71\n00:04:29.173 --> 00:04:34.650\nthat's one of the machines within\nthis lab environment here.\n\n72\n00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.320\nBut I'm currently in interactive mode.\n\n73\n00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.630\nYou can still see that carrot.\n\n74\n00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.650\nAnd don't mind that DNS just the way\nthat it is configured here I have to\n\n75\n00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.720\ngo ahead and do some modifications,\nbut there are two different modes.\n\n76\n00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.800\nSo, interactive mode is\nwhere you maintain that and\n\n77\n00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.560\nif you wanted to exit out of there,\nyou would simply type in exit and\n\n78\n00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.432\nthen that would exit you out\nof that interactive mode.\n\n79\n00:05:01.432 --> 00:05:04.290\nNow nslookup is pretty\ncool because it's actually\n\n80\n00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.640\noverwriting that particular local cache.\n\n81\n00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.790\nSo anything that you have stored\nin that machine is going to be\n\n82\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.950\nbypassed whenever you're using nslookup\nbecause it's going straight directly to\n\n83\n00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.480\na DNS server, and you can also specify\nwhich DNS server you wanna go ahead and\n\n84\n00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.770\ncommunicate and contact.\n\n85\n00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.540\nTo pull those records from.\n\n86\n00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.430\nSo those are a couple different\ntools that you can use\n\n87\n00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.610\nright within this particular interface.\n\n88\n00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.470\nNow, if we're talking server side,\nthere are some commandlets, and I put them\n\n89\n00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.020\nin the notes, I'm just gonna cover some of\nthis troubleshooting tools that you have.\n\n90\n00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.180\nThere are lot available at your disposal,\nwe're gonna be looking a little more into\n\n91\n00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.470\nserver so I wanted this also show\nyou there isn't option if you use\n\n92\n00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.650\nthe Get-DnsServer and\nthis is going to be statistics.\n\n93\n00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.270\nThis commandlet will go ahead and render\nstatistics for that entire DNS server.\n\n94\n00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.160\nYou can even at a more granular level,\nspecify the particular zone, because\n\n95\n00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.180\nremember your DNS server can house most\nmultiple zones if you choose to do so.\n\n96\n00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.760\nSo, if you wanted to look at statistics,\nI don't have many statistics in this\n\n97\n00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.200\nenvironment, because I literally\njust span this DNS server up, so\n\n98\n00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.100\nyou don't see a lot listed here,\nbut this could be a useful tool for\n\n99\n00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.600\ntroubleshooting on the server side.\n\n100\n00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.270\nNow, if I go ahead and type in,\nthe up arrow, if I wanted\n\n101\n00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.650\nto specify a particular zone, I would just\ngo ahead and type in and add a zone name.\n\n102\n00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.880\nAnd here,\nmy zone name is going to be Practicelab.\n\n103\n00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.800\nAnd that's gonna be .com.\n\n104\n00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.180\nAnd so now I'm just kind of narrowing in\nthat field and I can gather statistics,\n\n105\n00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.520\nbecause a lot of times,\nwhen we're talking administration duty,\n\n106\n00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.710\na lot of it is just\ngathering informations.\n\n107\n00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.830\nYou can see, okay, don't make you\nsick from all this scrolling.\n\n108\n00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.470\nScrolling down, there's a lot you can\ngather from these utilities here.\n\n109\n00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.630\nBut that's not it, there are some more.\n\n110\n00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.780\nThere's a DNS command so let me go ahead.\n\n111\n00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:18.150\nMicrosoft does a really great job\nat providing documentation for\n\n112\n00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.660\nall of these utilities.\n\n113\n00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.040\nSo this is going to be and I provided this\ninformation also in the show notes for\n\n114\n00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.820\nyou but the syntax for what I just showed\nyou and what you can do with the DNS\n\n115\n00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.380\nserver statistics commandlet,\ndifferent options you have there.\n\n116\n00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.550\nNow, another option that you do have\navailable is something called Dnscmd.\n\n117\n00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.630\nNow, this is going to be helpful whenever\nyou're trying to automate scripts\n\n118\n00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.370\nto go ahead and\nperform management utilities.\n\n119\n00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:46.650\nAgain, server side.\n\n120\n00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:51.540\nSo this is Dnscmd and again,\nMicrosoft provides a lot of syntax for\n\n121\n00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.920\nyou to really customize and\nwork with in your environment.\n\n122\n00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.487\nAll right, what else is next?\n\n123\n00:07:57.487 --> 00:08:02.310\nDNSLint, now this is another\nMicrosoft based utility.\n\n124\n00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.690\nIt helps you diagnose common\nDNS name resolution issues.\n\n125\n00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.210\nSo in addition to NS Lookup,\nThey do offer DNSLint.\n\n126\n00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.510\nIt is an additional download,\nand you can see the link here.\n\n127\n00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.600\nYou would have to go ahead and\nmanually download it and install that.\n\n128\n00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.040\nAnd again, I've provided that\nin the show notes for you.\n\n129\n00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.040\nSo just know that there\nare commands associated with that.\n\n130\n00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.480\nAnd we really do have a lot of utilities.\n\n131\n00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.800\nAnd if you think about DNS\nholistically in Microsoft land.\n\n132\n00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.050\nBut that's really where we've been\nthroughout this entire conversation.\n\n133\n00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:34.930\nBut, DNS is so much more than that.\n\n134\n00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.840\nIt's vendor neutral, this concept.\n\n135\n00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.540\nRemember, it's one of our\ncore network concepts.\n\n136\n00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:44.580\nAnd if you look at something like BIND,\nwhich came from the Internet consortium.\n\n137\n00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.760\nBerkeley Internet Name Domain.\n\n138\n00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.000\nI can never remember that\none off the top of my head.\n\n139\n00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.400\nBut, also a DNS alternative\nvery common and\n\n140\n00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.970\nthere's a utility called Dig that\nyou can use to help resolve similar\n\n141\n00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:02.540\nissues within that type of environment,\nmostly with next space systems.\n\n142\n00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.505\nSo what else do we have here?\n\n143\n00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:09.165\nIP configure,\nIP config we've covered that.\n\n144\n00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:12.950\nNow there's also an option\nwithin server manager and I'm\n\n145\n00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:17.685\ngonna really take you on a little journey\nand we'll look at the individual tabs, but\n\n146\n00:09:17.685 --> 00:09:22.265\nthere is an integrated monitoring utility\nthat you can just go ahead and it will\n\n147\n00:09:22.265 --> 00:09:27.740\nsend queries to test the connection for\nparticular DNS server as well.\n\n148\n00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.120\nUnder the properties of that\nserver within the GUI interface.\n\n149\n00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.140\nAnd something that's\nprobably not as common but\n\n150\n00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.090\ncould potentially be an issue,\nif we think back to client side,\n\n151\n00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.610\nI've worked with clients before,\nand if we take a look at my screen.\n\n152\n00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:48.950\nSo Cisco actually has a product,\nthey acquired it called Open DNS.\n\n153\n00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:53.410\nSo, if you think about the name, so\nobviously it has something to do with our\n\n154\n00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:59.390\nDNS here, but it's kind of interesting\nbecause it's a method in which you can\n\n155\n00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:04.960\nrestrict access to certain websites.\n\n156\n00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.700\nAnd by doing so, what you're doing\nis specifying this particular.\n\n157\n00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.650\nThey have a couple different IP addresses.\n\n158\n00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.590\nSo you're saying when you configure,\nlet's say an individual machine like for\n\n159\n00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.530\na child, you don't want them to\ngo to any inappropriate sites.\n\n160\n00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:23.500\nSo you go under your IPv4 settings or\nIPv6 if you're using that.\n\n161\n00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.240\nBut there is that portion where you\ncan enter the DNS server IP addresses.\n\n162\n00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.210\nSo if you go ahead and\nuse their IP addresses.\n\n163\n00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:36.492\nNow, if you sign up for\na free account they have a pre-populated\n\n164\n00:10:36.492 --> 00:10:41.011\nlist of inappropriate sites, but\nif you were to create your own your\n\n165\n00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:45.555\nown site then you can modify that and\ntweak it to however you choose.\n\n166\n00:10:45.555 --> 00:10:47.305\nAnd so, just think about that as well.\n\n167\n00:10:47.305 --> 00:10:52.465\nSo if you're using that DNS server to go\nahead and resolve those names for you,\n\n168\n00:10:52.465 --> 00:10:57.415\nremember how powerful DNS is in the sense\nthat if that information is incorrect\n\n169\n00:10:57.415 --> 00:11:01.075\nthose resource records, you're not\ngoing to get to that final destination.\n\n170\n00:11:01.075 --> 00:11:04.933\nSo inherently, you're able to go ahead and\nblock those types of sites.\n\n171\n00:11:04.933 --> 00:11:10.006\nNow, that maybe something that you wanna\ncheck you always wanna check to make sure\n\n172\n00:11:10.006 --> 00:11:14.876\nthat, the correct IP address is input for\nthat particular DNS setting there.\n\n173\n00:11:14.876 --> 00:11:20.040\nBecause that's something that could\neasily be far fingered or mistyped.\n\n174\n00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.200\nSo not only can you go ahead and\nimplement that on an individual machine,\n\n175\n00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.980\nlike for a child but\nthink about DHCP, right.\n\n176\n00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:34.772\nSo DHCP offers information like\nDNS along with our subset mask and\n\n177\n00:11:34.772 --> 00:11:36.780\nour default gateway.\n\n178\n00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.705\nSo a lot of our devices even our all\nin one devices like our routers that\n\n179\n00:11:40.705 --> 00:11:43.615\nyou may use at home have the ability,\nmost of them,\n\n180\n00:11:43.615 --> 00:11:47.790\nalmost all of them have the ability\nto offer some sort of DHCP.\n\n181\n00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.450\nSo, by offering that and\npushing out a DNS server for\n\n182\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.620\neveryone that connects to that device, you\nmay wanna also check that device to make\n\n183\n00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.290\nsure that it's not overwriting in\nthe information within that system.\n\n184\n00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.490\nSo, there's a lot to think about\nreally narrowing it down on where\n\n185\n00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.130\nthat problem may lie,\nwhether it be client side, server side.\n\n186\n00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.010\nYou've got tons of tools\navailable at your disposal.\n\n187\n00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:14.390\nAnd also, Brian gives some really cool\nscenario-based situations at the end of\n\n188\n00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:19.010\nthis chapter in his book to help get you\nthinking in that way, because that's\n\n189\n00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:23.290\nsomething that will come with time but\nalso just playing around with these tools.\n\n190\n00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.900\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, there's no doubt\nthat the idea here of understanding\n\n191\n00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.870\nthe basics of client side name resolution\nis gonna be very helpful when we begin to\n\n192\n00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:37.810\nwork with servers of deciding where we're\nactually gonna troubleshoot, right?\n\n193\n00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.540\nThe majority of the times when working\nas a desktop support technician, we're\n\n194\n00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:45.540\nnormally thinking that the issue normally\ndoes rely with the client, itself.\n\n195\n00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.300\nSo, Cherokee did show us\nwhere that is possible.\n\n196\n00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.840\nBut then, she also talked about\nsome of the tools that will\n\n197\n00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.570\nhelp us to differentiate where we're\nactually going to be taking a look\n\n198\n00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:57.560\nwhether we're on the individual machine or\non the server, itself.\n\n199\n00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.800\nSo, all of these tools are valuable\ntools that a server administrator would\n\n200\n00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.620\nbecome familiar with of course.\n\n201\n00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.080\nAnd if you're just starting,\nright, take some time,\n\n202\n00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.800\ntake a look at the links that Cherokee\ndid show right here on this show as well.\n\n203\n00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.640\nMake sure you understand what\nthose utilities are going to be.\n\n204\n00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.241\nSo we're not completely done with DNS but\n\n205\n00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:21.080\nthat does end our episode right here in\nterms of client side name resolution.\n\n206\n00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.278\nCherokee did you have\nanything else to add?\n\n207\n00:13:23.278 --> 00:13:24.370\n&gt;&gt; You know what Ronnie, I did think of\n\n208\n00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.400\none more thing that I would\nlike to share with you guys.\n\n209\n00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:32.020\nSomething that Is pretty true for a lot of\ndifferent services within our environment\n\n210\n00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.940\nand I don't remember if I told you or\nnot so I want to go ahead and show this.\n\n211\n00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.350\nI don't know if you've ever had issues\nwhere you had to go ahead and start and\n\n212\n00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:42.600\nrestart that principle of service,\nbut on the client side,\n\n213\n00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.050\nthat service can get hung up as well so.\n\n214\n00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.040\nWe will take a look at how to go ahead and\n\n215\n00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.290\nmanage that within the server\nside of things here momentarily.\n\n216\n00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:54.350\nBut I did wanna show you from\nthe client side how that works.\n\n217\n00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:55.830\nSo if you were to just go ahead and\n\n218\n00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:00.840\npull up,\nyou can shortcut it to your run line here.\n\n219\n00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.680\nAnd the actual command or\nthe run line command here is going to be,\n\n220\n00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.820\nthis is just our services.msc, if I can\n\n221\n00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.830\ntype services.msc just\nlike you would find,\n\n222\n00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.580\nthe name of the service is\nactually called DNS client cache.\n\n223\n00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:26.410\nSo you could go ahead and stop,\nfind it, DNS let me go ahead.\n\n224\n00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:30.900\nDNS Client, okay not client cache,\nit's just DNS Client here.\n\n225\n00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.250\nAnd zoom in for you.\n\n226\n00:14:35.484 --> 00:14:38.336\nAnd just like any other service,\nyou can just go ahead and\n\n227\n00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:41.554\nright-click on that, and stop and\nthen restart that service.\n\n228\n00:14:41.554 --> 00:14:48.390\nAnd hopefully or you could just hit\nrestart if that's your intended purpose.\n\n229\n00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:52.200\nDuring that time, whenever you,\nlets say I stopped this service and\n\n230\n00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:57.520\nthen I preformed some kind of\nlookups against a DNS server.\n\n231\n00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.030\nThat information would not be\nstored in my DNS cache also.\n\n232\n00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:02.670\nYou might wanna keep that in mind.\n\n233\n00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:06.168\nThere's an option to go ahead and\nstop that service client side.\n\n234\n00:15:06.168 --> 00:15:07.910\nBut we're gonna dive\na little bit deeper and\n\n235\n00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.070\ntake a look at that from\nthe server side in the next show.\n\n236\n00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.100\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee.\n\n237\n00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.830\nWell, thank you again as we end this\nepisode and it's a great place for\n\n238\n00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:21.150\nus to jump off into the idea of\nthe server side resolutions as well.\n\n239\n00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:25.450\nSo signing off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n240\n00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:26.650\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boost.\n\n241\n00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.332\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Windows server 101

Francisco.\n\n3\n00:00:04.655 --> 00:00:06.447\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.447 --> 00:00:08.518\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.518 --> 00:00:12.170\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.337\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.337 --> 00:00:18.520\nYou're watching\nthe Windows Server 101 show.\n\n8\n00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.880\nI'm your host Ronnie Wang, and\n\n9\n00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.230\ntoday we're gonna be taking a look\nat managing the DNS server role.\n\n10\n00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.460\nIn a previous episode we already talked\nabout the client-side management, and\n\n11\n00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.470\nnow jumping into the server-side.\n\n12\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.440\nTo help us out is gonna\nbe Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n13\n00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.640\nCherokee, welcome back to the studios.\n\n14\n00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks, Ronnie,\nI'm super grateful to be back today.\n\n15\n00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.750\nBecause we have so\nmuch to cover when we talk about DNS.\n\n16\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.160\nThere are a lot of different\nmoving components, and\n\n17\n00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.150\nI wanna make sure that we get them all in.\n\n18\n00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.420\nYes, we are on our second chapter here,\nwhen we're talking about DNS.\n\n19\n00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.960\nSo we'll specifically\nlook at the actual role.\n\n20\n00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.800\nIf we look at my screen real quick, I'd\nlike to dive right into server manager and\n\n21\n00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.250\nI wanna pull up the DNS MMC Snap-in here.\n\n22\n00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.860\nSo our management console is going\nto have this particular interface.\n\n23\n00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.580\nHere we see our actual plabdc01.\n\n24\n00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.500\nIf you click on it, you can expand it out.\n\n25\n00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.310\nThere are a lot of different things\nthat we can do here from within this\n\n26\n00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.880\nparticular console.\n\n27\n00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.260\nSo I can create zones, I can go ahead and\nlook at different host records.\n\n28\n00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.220\nWe'll be talking about those, as well.\n\n29\n00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.460\nWe'll save zones for the next chapter,\nwe'll really go into depth there.\n\n30\n00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.130\nBut for right now, we'll take a look our\nresource records, manage our root hints.\n\n31\n00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.500\nWe'll talk about that during\nthis particular show.\n\n32\n00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.670\nWe'll also mention how we can go ahead and\nconfigure forwarders and\n\n33\n00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.620\nconditional forwarding.\n\n34\n00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.510\nAnd we'll take a look at what this\nmanagement console has to offer us.\n\n35\n00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.500\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\n\n36\n00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.540\nwhere are we gonna begin since it's such\na big topic when it comes down to DNS?\n\n37\n00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.782\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you could go ahead and pull\nthis up like I did through server manager.\n\n38\n00:01:52.782 --> 00:01:55.660\nI wanna look at the properties for\nour particular server here.\n\n39\n00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.360\nBut there's also a run line utility.\n\n40\n00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.806\nAnd that's going to be\nin the show notes here.\n\n41\n00:02:00.806 --> 00:02:06.720\nAnd that's DNSMGMT.MSC if you wanted to\njust go ahead and pull this up quickly.\n\n42\n00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.040\nAnd when I'm working here within the GUI,\n\n43\n00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.020\nI can just kind of hover over\nmy server here on the left pane.\n\n44\n00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.000\nAnd right click, and from here I\ncan go down and select Properties.\n\n45\n00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.890\nNow, from within this management\nconsole I'm not limited to just\n\n46\n00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.950\none particular zone.\n\n47\n00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.490\nI can have multiple zones.\n\n48\n00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.680\nAnd remember, when I say the term, zones,\n\n49\n00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.690\nzones are like databases that are storing\nthose particular resource records.\n\n50\n00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.750\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n51\n00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.060\ntake a look at the options that\nI have here within properties.\n\n52\n00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.590\nAnd I'll try to zoom in a little bit for\nyou and then get this out of the way.\n\n53\n00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.837\nOops, why did I do that?\n\n54\n00:02:44.837 --> 00:02:46.488\nI zoom in and then I moved that.\n\n55\n00:02:46.488 --> 00:02:51.639\nOkay, so\nlet's take a look at our particular Tabs.\n\n56\n00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.711\nThis is something that Microsoft\ndefinitely wants to make sure that you\n\n57\n00:02:54.711 --> 00:02:55.790\nare aware of.\n\n58\n00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.100\nSo the first one that we see here\nis going to be our Interfaces tab.\n\n59\n00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.670\nAnd you can see, my IPv6 and\nmy IPv4 addresses,\n\n60\n00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.290\nmy APIPA address that is located here.\n\n61\n00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.490\nBy default, we're probably gonna\nkeep all of these changed.\n\n62\n00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.720\nYou don't have to.\n\n63\n00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.160\nBut if you do specify one particular\ninterface IP address to go ahead and\n\n64\n00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.650\nlisten for those queries and\ncommunications.\n\n65\n00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.840\nYou need to keep that in mind if\nyou configure your firewall and\n\n66\n00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.660\nyou punch a hole through your firewall for\nthat particular IP address.\n\n67\n00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.650\nIf you ever go about changing\nthat network interface card,\n\n68\n00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.610\nthat's something that you'll\nwanna take a look at.\n\n69\n00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.620\nSo normally people just keep them at\ntheir default there for your interfaces.\n\n70\n00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.004\nAll right,\nnext we have our Forwarders tab.\n\n71\n00:03:43.004 --> 00:03:48.852\nActually, let me zoom back out and we're\ngonna hop on over to our simple diagrams.\n\n72\n00:03:48.852 --> 00:03:51.895\nI just wanna refresh you,\nI know we've looked at this in the past.\n\n73\n00:03:51.895 --> 00:03:59.949\nBut remember forwarding is going to be\nthe process of hey, here I have a client.\n\n74\n00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:06.750\nAnd my client is sending a recursive\nquery to my internal DNS server.\n\n75\n00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.940\nSo, let's think about that for a second.\n\n76\n00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.350\nIf my internal DNS server is authoritative\nand responsible for answering the queries\n\n77\n00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.160\nwithin my domain, my IT .pro domain,\nwhat about all of those external queries?\n\n78\n00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.050\nSo maybe this client wants to query\nMicrosoft.com, CNN.com, or whatever.\n\n79\n00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:33.370\nSo I could have this particular DNS\nserver, be handling all of that.\n\n80\n00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.360\nBut it might be beneficial if I have\nan agreement with my ISP to go ahead and\n\n81\n00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.280\njust create a forwarder.\n\n82\n00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.830\nAnd say, look My IT Pro DNS server's\ngonna handle all my internal requests.\n\n83\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.030\nBut if you have an external request I'm\ngonna go ahead and forward you over to\n\n84\n00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.260\nthe ISP DNS to kind of offset\nsome of those calculations.\n\n85\n00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.130\nAnd free that up, so my internal DNS can\nhandle those internal requests, right?\n\n86\n00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.130\nAnd also, I wanted to mention\nconditional forwarding.\n\n87\n00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.360\nAnd I know we spoke about that before.\n\n88\n00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.990\nSo this is that same diagram.\n\n89\n00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.810\nBut I wanted to kind of just put it into\nperspective again from a production side\n\n90\n00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.550\nof things.\n\n91\n00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.079\nWhat was this?\n\n92\n00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:15.770\nOur Contoso.com.\n\n93\n00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.910\nSo any time this client had a query for\n\n94\n00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.970\na machine within that Contoso\ndomain it would go ahead and\n\n95\n00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.080\nforward to that server automatically\nto circumvent these iterative queries.\n\n96\n00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.168\nAnd going all the way\nup to your root hints.\n\n97\n00:05:33.168 --> 00:05:36.330\nSo where might we see this\nin a production environment?\n\n98\n00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.580\nIf we're dealing with acquisitions or\nmergers within a business organization.\n\n99\n00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.360\nAnd a lot of times we'll go ahead and\nset up those conditional forwarders.\n\n100\n00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.630\nOr if you're doing business with\nsomeone quite often within a particular\n\n101\n00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.750\ndomain there.\n\n102\n00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.140\nSo I just wanted to show you that and\nthat particular tab.\n\n103\n00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.856\nLet's hop back in here and see what\nelse this window has to offer for us.\n\n104\n00:05:58.856 --> 00:06:01.560\nNow, under the Advanced tab,\n\n105\n00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.360\nthere are a lot of options here that we\nnormally don't play around with too much.\n\n106\n00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.390\nBut just knowing that\nthey're available here.\n\n107\n00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.380\nRemember this is our BIND that\nBerkeley Internet Name Domain system for\n\n108\n00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.770\nthose Nix based systems.\n\n109\n00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.840\nWhen you talk about our particular,\nI guess, syntax.\n\n110\n00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.537\nSo if we take a look at how that all\nworks, DNS records can be interchangeable.\n\n111\n00:06:25.537 --> 00:06:28.132\nThe syntax is the same,\nso they can communicate.\n\n112\n00:06:28.132 --> 00:06:31.597\nThere is just some slight minutia\nthat you want to keep in mind when\n\n113\n00:06:31.597 --> 00:06:36.065\nyou're working with Nix, with Bind,\nand within a Microsoft environment.\n\n114\n00:06:36.065 --> 00:06:39.095\nBut this is where you would go ahead and\nselect that.\n\n115\n00:06:39.095 --> 00:06:41.340\nAnd a couple other things here.\n\n116\n00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.700\nWe really won't focus on them too much.\n\n117\n00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.440\nI do wanna point out this is where you\nwould enable Round Robin because we're\n\n118\n00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.490\ngonna come back and\ntake a look at that in a few.\n\n119\n00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.560\nBy default, it is selected to be enabled.\n\n120\n00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.120\nAnd this is where you would go ahead and\ndisable that if you chose to do so.\n\n121\n00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.470\nNow let's take a look\nat this particular tab.\n\n122\n00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.466\nThis is our Root Hints tab or\nif you recall,\n\n123\n00:07:03.466 --> 00:07:08.137\nwe did speak about this,\nthe different servers, the A through M.\n\n124\n00:07:08.137 --> 00:07:13.630\nAnd those are gonna be at the very root\nof our hierarchy there within DNS.\n\n125\n00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.370\nWindows, so let's say the different\nversions, the iterations of the different\n\n126\n00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.140\noperating systems,\nlike with Server 2012 versus Server 2016.\n\n127\n00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:30.800\nMicrosoft is going to try to keep this\ninformation as up-to-date as possible.\n\n128\n00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:36.210\nBut what if one of these particular\nroots changed their IP address?\n\n129\n00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.206\nWe see our IP address as noted here.\n\n130\n00:07:40.206 --> 00:07:45.160\nI also wanna talk about, in this episode,\nhaving an accurate DNS system.\n\n131\n00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.010\nSo having these records,\nthat's great to be able to retain them.\n\n132\n00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:53.060\nBut we want them to be as up-to-date and\naccurate as possible.\n\n133\n00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.366\nSo there are a couple of different\nways in which you can ensure that\n\n134\n00:07:57.366 --> 00:07:59.883\nthis information is in fact correct.\n\n135\n00:07:59.883 --> 00:08:01.891\nSo, let's take a look at that.\n\n136\n00:08:01.891 --> 00:08:03.877\nSo, I have here on a browser,\n\n137\n00:08:03.877 --> 00:08:07.460\nnow this page should look\nfamiliar to you right here.\n\n138\n00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.513\nWe've already taken a look at this.\n\n139\n00:08:08.513 --> 00:08:13.233\nThis is just our root-servers.org\nsponsored by Iana.\n\n140\n00:08:13.233 --> 00:08:16.201\nNow, if you scroll down and\nsee here, like,\n\n141\n00:08:16.201 --> 00:08:19.494\nwe're just on A for\nthat particular root server.\n\n142\n00:08:19.494 --> 00:08:22.170\nIt notes that IP address right here.\n\n143\n00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.204\nSo you can see 198.41.0.4.\n\n144\n00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:27.604\nSo you could kind of double check and\n\n145\n00:08:27.604 --> 00:08:30.575\nverify that that is\nthe correct IP address.\n\n146\n00:08:32.687 --> 00:08:36.346\nIf you wanted to,\nI'm kind of just bouncing around here,\n\n147\n00:08:36.346 --> 00:08:38.446\nbut let me go back to that window.\n\n148\n00:08:38.446 --> 00:08:39.990\nThere're a couple of different\nthings that you could do.\n\n149\n00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:44.125\nSo if I copy and\npasted that IP address from that A server,\n\n150\n00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:46.890\nI can go ahead and put that right here.\n\n151\n00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:47.586\nCopy from server.\n\n152\n00:08:47.586 --> 00:08:52.314\nBecause that A server is going to retain\nthe other IP addresses of the other root\n\n153\n00:08:52.314 --> 00:08:53.220\nservers.\n\n154\n00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.523\nSo it'll make sure if we go ahead and\nsay copy from the server and this is where\n\n155\n00:08:57.523 --> 00:09:01.644\nI would put the IP address okay so\nthat's one way where you could do that.\n\n156\n00:09:01.644 --> 00:09:06.090\nYou also have the ability to go ahead and\nutilize files.\n\n157\n00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:11.910\nSo Iana also will give you let me see here\nI put this link in the show notes for you.\n\n158\n00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:17.069\nBut there's an option, where you can\ngo ahead and download those Root Hints\n\n159\n00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:22.483\nfiles with the correct and most up to\ndate information, either via FTP or HTTP.\n\n160\n00:09:22.483 --> 00:09:26.868\nThey don't change this\ninformation very often.\n\n161\n00:09:26.868 --> 00:09:29.704\nActually I think If I remember correctly,\n\n162\n00:09:29.704 --> 00:09:35.012\nin April of this year there was wait,\nthat was just their last announcement.\n\n163\n00:09:35.012 --> 00:09:40.450\nSo IPv6 address came out,\nthey have an announcement from 2002.\n\n164\n00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.790\nLet's see I don't even\nknow if this was just.\n\n165\n00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.220\nSo this wasn't an actual\nIP Address change,\n\n166\n00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:50.150\nit was stating that they were now\nutilizing Anycast for a particular.\n\n167\n00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:56.990\nWhich one b roots IPv6 address\nokay will be re numbered for IPv6.\n\n168\n00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.990\nSo any kind of notification should\nbe noted on their site, but\n\n169\n00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.590\nthey don't change them very often so\njust kinda keep that in mind.\n\n170\n00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.494\nWindows does try to keep up with\nthat with the multiple versions but\n\n171\n00:10:07.494 --> 00:10:11.763\nyou do have an option to manually go\nahead and make sure that is up to date.\n\n172\n00:10:11.763 --> 00:10:16.485\nAll right,\nWhat are the tabs do we have here?\n\n173\n00:10:16.485 --> 00:10:19.583\nWe have our debugging and logging tab.\n\n174\n00:10:19.583 --> 00:10:23.961\nSo if you ever needed\nadditional information for\n\n175\n00:10:23.961 --> 00:10:29.086\ndebugging purposes,\nthis is where you could go ahead and\n\n176\n00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:34.630\nutilize that and its going to\nbe monitoring the DNS traffic.\n\n177\n00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:40.191\nAnd so you may not wanna enable this just\non a regular basis to generate additional-\n\n178\n00:10:40.191 --> 00:10:41.816\n&gt;&gt; Traffic?\n\n179\n00:10:41.816 --> 00:10:42.890\n&gt;&gt; Files.\nBut, yeah.\n\n180\n00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:46.364\nSo you just wanna go ahead and\nuse this add-on on an as-needed basis.\n\n181\n00:10:46.364 --> 00:10:49.334\nBut by default,\nif we look at our event logging tab,\n\n182\n00:10:49.334 --> 00:10:52.855\nyou can see that by default I\nhaven't changed anything here.\n\n183\n00:10:52.855 --> 00:10:57.420\nAll events should be saved within\nyour event viewer, within those logs.\n\n184\n00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:02.205\nOr you could go ahead and specify to not\nlog any of these events if you wanted to.\n\n185\n00:11:02.205 --> 00:11:05.320\nOr errors only so that just depends.\n\n186\n00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.330\nYou do have that option.\n\n187\n00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.650\nNow this is kind of a neat\nlittle utility here.\n\n188\n00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.930\nYou can go ahead and\nwe'll just perform a simple query.\n\n189\n00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.340\nBut you could select either simple\nqueries or recursive queries,\n\n190\n00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:21.380\nto go ahead and\ntest against that particular DNS server.\n\n191\n00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.345\nAnd then your results would\njust be noted here for\n\n192\n00:11:24.345 --> 00:11:28.105\nhere you see that simple query\npassing with the time and date or\n\n193\n00:11:28.105 --> 00:11:32.540\nyou could also set it to go ahead and\ntest that specific interval as well.\n\n194\n00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.096\nSo, that's an integrated tool\nthat you do have available.\n\n195\n00:11:35.096 --> 00:11:37.460\nI think we mentioned that when we're\ntalking about different tools.\n\n196\n00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.389\nBut there you go that's\nwhere it's located.\n\n197\n00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:44.460\nAnd then, here within security, you do\nhave the option to go ahead and set ACLs.\n\n198\n00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:50.792\nAnd just keep in mind, this is something\nDNS is a sensitive core network service,\n\n199\n00:11:50.792 --> 00:11:55.574\nso you wanna keep that in mind when you're\nthinking about who should have access to\n\n200\n00:11:55.574 --> 00:11:56.781\nthis information.\n\n201\n00:11:58.845 --> 00:12:02.688\nAll right, so\nwhat else to we have here within DNS?\n\n202\n00:12:02.688 --> 00:12:07.121\nWhat about our services?\n\n203\n00:12:07.121 --> 00:12:11.927\nAll right so as we saw within\nthe client side operating systems we\n\n204\n00:12:11.927 --> 00:12:15.450\nwere able to stop and\nrestart that service.\n\n205\n00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.232\nWell you can do that the same way here\nwithin the server side of things.\n\n206\n00:12:19.232 --> 00:12:23.131\nSo one thing you can do is\njust right click on top of\n\n207\n00:12:23.131 --> 00:12:26.956\nthat actual server on\nthe left hand side there.\n\n208\n00:12:26.956 --> 00:12:31.748\nAnd let's see here,\nit's gonna be under all tasks.\n\n209\n00:12:31.748 --> 00:12:33.890\nAnd let me try to zoom in a little bit for\nyou.\n\n210\n00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.380\nYou have the ability to go ahead and\n\n211\n00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.380\nso the start option is great out\nhere because it's already running.\n\n212\n00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.111\nYou can stop it and then restart it.\n\n213\n00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:45.430\nThat would be one option.\n\n214\n00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.222\nOr you could go ahead and either pause or\n\n215\n00:12:48.222 --> 00:12:51.530\nrestart just depending\non your choice there.\n\n216\n00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:55.207\nBut that's one way to do\nit from within the GUI.\n\n217\n00:12:55.207 --> 00:13:01.386\nYou can also go ahead alternatively and\njust pull up PowerShell, and like Ronnie,\n\n218\n00:13:01.386 --> 00:13:07.670\nI've gotta change my font here real quick,\nif you guys can bear with me for a second.\n\n219\n00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.829\nLet's go ahead and ramp it up to 24 and\njust give a bit of contrast and\n\n220\n00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:12.993\nsee if that helps.\n\n221\n00:13:16.377 --> 00:13:17.004\n&gt;&gt; You changed the background.\n\n222\n00:13:17.004 --> 00:13:18.480\n&gt;&gt; I changed the background color.\n\n223\n00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.409\nThat's not gonna help, sorry guys.\n\n224\n00:13:20.409 --> 00:13:21.910\nGive me one second here.\n\n225\n00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.141\nSo for\nmy colors I forgot to select screen text.\n\n226\n00:13:24.141 --> 00:13:27.857\nSo let me just change that background\ncolor back, and then put the screen text\n\n227\n00:13:27.857 --> 00:13:30.789\nas a bright white, and\nthat should be a little better for us.\n\n228\n00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:35.220\nAll right, and it's really, I just\nwanted to show you this simple command,\n\n229\n00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.480\nof how you would stop or\nstart that particular service.\n\n230\n00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.581\nSo here, since my service is already\nrunning, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n231\n00:13:41.581 --> 00:13:43.062\nselect Stop, and then Service.\n\n232\n00:13:45.331 --> 00:13:48.251\nBecause there's a space between\nthis particular service,\n\n233\n00:13:48.251 --> 00:13:50.662\nyou wanna sure that you do\nenclose that in quotes.\n\n234\n00:13:50.662 --> 00:13:52.387\nSo this is going to be our DNS.\n\n235\n00:13:52.387 --> 00:13:53.543\n&gt;&gt; And you misspelt services.\n\n236\n00:13:53.543 --> 00:13:55.227\n&gt;&gt; That's just great, Ronnie.\n\n237\n00:13:55.227 --> 00:13:58.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n238\n00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.529\nSo here we see stop service.\n\n239\n00:14:00.529 --> 00:14:04.470\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and type\nin DNS and then that's gonna be server.\n\n240\n00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.331\nAnd then just end Quotes.\n\n241\n00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:08.430\nSo there we have it.\n\n242\n00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.360\nWe have it stopped if you wanted to\nhop back into GUI and restart it.\n\n243\n00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:16.200\nYou can also use your Get-service\n\n244\n00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.330\nto check on the status of that\nparticular service that's running.\n\n245\n00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.140\nSo we can see here we'll just go ahead and\nstart.\n\n246\n00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.628\nBecause now you can see how the stop and\nall the other commands are grayed out, but\n\n247\n00:14:27.628 --> 00:14:30.213\nmy only option here is to go ahead and\nrestart.\n\n248\n00:14:32.985 --> 00:14:34.970\nAll right, so what else do we have?\n\n249\n00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:38.460\nI wanna make sure I'm not skipping\nanything because there is a lot to cover\n\n250\n00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.370\nhere, and I don't wanna leave anything.\n\n251\n00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.918\n&gt;&gt; You wanna take a look at the idea\nof the server cache here and\n\n252\n00:14:43.918 --> 00:14:45.277\nwhy that's important for us.\n\n253\n00:14:45.277 --> 00:14:49.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so server cache,\nwe talked about this a little bit and\n\n254\n00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.150\nhow I could look at\nthat within PowerShell.\n\n255\n00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.220\nSo since I should just\nclose that of PowerShell.\n\n256\n00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.870\nLet me pull that back up.\n\n257\n00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.870\nAnd of course, I have,\nmy small font again.\n\n258\n00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.366\nRonnie, don't let me exit next time.\n\n259\n00:15:03.366 --> 00:15:08.022\nI'm just, it's a habit, so\nI'm just gonna minimize it next time.\n\n260\n00:15:08.022 --> 00:15:08.808\nHow about that?\n\n261\n00:15:08.808 --> 00:15:09.974\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n262\n00:15:09.974 --> 00:15:12.374\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good he's like okay, Cherokee.\n\n263\n00:15:12.374 --> 00:15:16.304\nSo if I go ahead and\n\n264\n00:15:16.304 --> 00:15:22.336\nuse show-DNSServerCache\n\n265\n00:15:25.397 --> 00:15:27.940\nGive it a second here and it'll propagate.\n\n266\n00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.214\nCurrently, I don't I'm just\nusing myself for server.\n\n267\n00:15:31.214 --> 00:15:34.756\nI have it on this lab environment,\ncalled out to the internet and\n\n268\n00:15:34.756 --> 00:15:36.340\nobtained any information.\n\n269\n00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.721\nSo, what we see here listed is\ngoing to be my root servers,\n\n270\n00:15:39.721 --> 00:15:41.247\nmy A through M right here.\n\n271\n00:15:41.247 --> 00:15:45.070\nBut that's one way we can\nview that information.\n\n272\n00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.260\nAlternatively, you know what?\n\n273\n00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.972\nWe can also view that within the GUI.\n\n274\n00:15:48.972 --> 00:15:51.880\nBut this is kind of interesting,\na couple different things here.\n\n275\n00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:56.762\nSometimes, not everything within this\nmanagement console Can be viewed by\n\n276\n00:15:56.762 --> 00:15:57.457\ndefault.\n\n277\n00:15:57.457 --> 00:16:00.610\nNot really sure why they did this,\nbut what is it under?\n\n278\n00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:05.650\nIt's under View, and then a couple\nof different ways you can do this.\n\n279\n00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.170\nYou're looking for\nthe Advanced option here.\n\n280\n00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.550\nWhen you select Advanced,\n\n281\n00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:12.220\nI want you to kinda note something\nover on my left-hand side.\n\n282\n00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:18.710\nSo originally, I don't have a folder that\nsays any kind of cache information here.\n\n283\n00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.450\nSo you can see that I don't have that.\n\n284\n00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:25.880\nBut if I come up here under View,\nand I select Advanced,\n\n285\n00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.300\nnow all of a sudden you saw that folder\npop in there that says Cached Lookup.\n\n286\n00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.440\nIn a normal production environment,\nthis is where you would go ahead and\n\n287\n00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.260\nlook at those cached lookups.\n\n288\n00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.090\nYou could use a couple different, like of\nthe command line utilities that we spoke\n\n289\n00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:46.800\nabout, nslookup or dnscmd if you wanted\nto manage individual cached information.\n\n290\n00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.479\nBecause if you think about, like any\ntype of DNS cache poisoning, right?\n\n291\n00:16:51.479 --> 00:16:56.593\nSo if any attacker says, okay,\nwww.itpro.tv is really pointing\n\n292\n00:16:56.593 --> 00:17:02.964\nto www.hackerland.com or something like\nthat, then you would wanna go in here and\n\n293\n00:17:02.964 --> 00:17:07.828\ngranularly select and\nremove those individual records.\n\n294\n00:17:07.828 --> 00:17:11.880\nIt's not gonna be the end of the world\nif you completely delete and\n\n295\n00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.380\nclear the cache for the entire DNS server.\n\n296\n00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:19.637\nIt's just gonna cause some latency for\nthe next time that that server has to\n\n297\n00:17:19.637 --> 00:17:24.820\ngo ahead and lookup, and call-out,\nand re-obtain that information.\n\n298\n00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.142\nSo that's something you might\nwanna keep in mind there.\n\n299\n00:17:28.929 --> 00:17:30.190\nWhat else do we have?\n\n300\n00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:34.204\nSo that's going to be our\nDNS server-side cache.\n\n301\n00:17:34.204 --> 00:17:37.565\nI do wanna also talk\nabout resource record.\n\n302\n00:17:37.565 --> 00:17:41.100\nI mentioned them, but we really haven't\ngone into depth about them here.\n\n303\n00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:46.310\nSo Microsoft has a list,\n\n304\n00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:50.800\nand I have put that in the notes for\nyou, also.\n\n305\n00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.780\nThere are a lot of\ndifferent resource records.\n\n306\n00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.760\nAnd you guys can look up\nthe RFC associated with those.\n\n307\n00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:00.648\nAnd find that there are more than we'd\nwant to cover in this particular show.\n\n308\n00:18:00.648 --> 00:18:04.885\nSo Microsoft kinda narrows down a common\nlist of what you would probably see\n\n309\n00:18:04.885 --> 00:18:05.632\nmost often.\n\n310\n00:18:05.632 --> 00:18:10.520\nSo let's focus on those for right now,\nand we'll go through that in each here.\n\n311\n00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:16.730\nSo here's the list, and then underneath\nthat, they go into detail about each one.\n\n312\n00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.650\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at,\n\n313\n00:18:23.137 --> 00:18:27.585\nOur SOA records first,\nSOA stands for start of authority.\n\n314\n00:18:27.585 --> 00:18:29.885\nSo what's included within\nour start of authority?\n\n315\n00:18:29.885 --> 00:18:31.882\nI'm trying to zoom in a little bit so\n\n316\n00:18:31.882 --> 00:18:34.552\nyou guys get like the perfect\nfont size for you.\n\n317\n00:18:34.552 --> 00:18:39.212\nSo SOA, it's kinda like letting\nus know who we should contact,\n\n318\n00:18:39.212 --> 00:18:43.285\nany kind of information about\na particular zone there.\n\n319\n00:18:43.285 --> 00:18:47.980\nSo every zone, and think about that\nzone kinda databases, how I married\n\n320\n00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.120\nthose two concepts in my head, because\nwe're talking about those files and\n\n321\n00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.560\nhow everything's managed\nwithin our servers, right?\n\n322\n00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:58.998\nSo every zone contains an SOA resource\nrecord at the beginning of the zone.\n\n323\n00:18:58.998 --> 00:19:03.070\nSo you're gonna be looking at things like\nthe owner, your time to lives, your class,\n\n324\n00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.080\nyour service types.\n\n325\n00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:09.510\nThe authoritative server field shows\nthe primary DNS server for the zone.\n\n326\n00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:14.030\nYou'll also note that here they have\ntheir responsible person noted.\n\n327\n00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:17.144\nBut it's just going to be in\nthe format of an email address.\n\n328\n00:19:17.144 --> 00:19:20.858\nAnd for instance, they use a period\ninstead of the at symbol for\n\n329\n00:19:20.858 --> 00:19:23.130\nthat particular email address.\n\n330\n00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:28.725\nSo you could find some helpful information\nwithin that particular SOA record.\n\n331\n00:19:28.725 --> 00:19:34.579\nAll right, here they just give you\nan example of one of those SOA records.\n\n332\n00:19:34.579 --> 00:19:39.730\nWhat's next up on our list here,\nwe have NS records, all right?\n\n333\n00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:43.680\nSo the name server resource record\nindicates the servers authoritative for\n\n334\n00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.730\nthat particular zone.\n\n335\n00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.871\nI know this is small, and\nI'll zoom in again for you.\n\n336\n00:19:47.871 --> 00:19:51.404\nBut that's going to be, again,\neach particular zone and\n\n337\n00:19:51.404 --> 00:19:54.685\nevery domain is gonna have\nan authoritative server.\n\n338\n00:19:54.685 --> 00:20:00.401\nSo your NS record points to that DNS\nserver that is authoritative for\n\n339\n00:20:00.401 --> 00:20:02.418\nthat particular zone.\n\n340\n00:20:02.418 --> 00:20:06.310\nPTR records, PTR records are kind of cool.\n\n341\n00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:11.130\nThey're essentially just the reverse\nof an A record or AAAA record.\n\n342\n00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:12.260\nAnd we'll take a look at those.\n\n343\n00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:18.500\nThey're just going to be taking that IP\naddress and mapping them to a host name.\n\n344\n00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.770\nI would like you to kind\nof note the design,\n\n345\n00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.620\nthe syntax of the way this is laid out.\n\n346\n00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:28.150\nI've came across this on a few exams here.\n\n347\n00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.100\nSo it is important to understand\nhow this is laid out.\n\n348\n00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:35.700\nAnd just for a real life use,\nas well, because they take, and\n\n349\n00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:41.562\nit's like the inverse of an IP address or\na network ID, and go backwards here.\n\n350\n00:20:41.562 --> 00:20:44.880\nSo you can think of it that way,\nlike PTR is the reverse.\n\n351\n00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.660\nAlso the IP address is listed backwards.\n\n352\n00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:53.251\nAnd then you'll also see this in-addr,\nas well, .arpa.\n\n353\n00:20:53.251 --> 00:20:56.825\nSo that's always going to be listed\nthere for those PTR records.\n\n354\n00:20:57.955 --> 00:21:01.575\nThis is another cool one, okay,\nanother common resource record.\n\n355\n00:21:01.575 --> 00:21:05.815\nIt's called CNAME, or canonical name,\nand it's essentially an alias.\n\n356\n00:21:05.815 --> 00:21:07.475\nWhere would we use an alias?\n\n357\n00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:11.610\nSo if I had a particular server,\n\n358\n00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:15.590\nmachine that I didn't want that\nIP address exposed externally.\n\n359\n00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:20.370\nSo maybe I had a machine\nthat I performed updates on.\n\n360\n00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:23.540\nOr maybe I thought I might perform\nan update on in the near future.\n\n361\n00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.802\nSo I really wouldn't want my\noutward-facing, maybe my client's or\n\n362\n00:21:26.802 --> 00:21:30.468\nthe public, knowing that I'm switching\nIP addresses or anything like that.\n\n363\n00:21:30.468 --> 00:21:36.490\nLike I wanna kind of keep my maintenance,\nyou just kind of hidden in the background.\n\n364\n00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.824\nSo I can create a CNAME in\nwhich that client's and\n\n365\n00:21:39.824 --> 00:21:44.787\npublicly accessible information is\nalways gonna be the same regardless\n\n366\n00:21:44.787 --> 00:21:48.301\nof what's going on internally\nbehind the scenes.\n\n367\n00:21:48.301 --> 00:21:49.205\nWhat else, Ronnie?\n\n368\n00:21:49.205 --> 00:21:53.695\nwww's quite often are gonna be used for\nCNAMEs because I might have\n\n369\n00:21:53.695 --> 00:21:58.199\nmultiple web servers functioning,\nperforming load balancing.\n\n370\n00:21:58.199 --> 00:22:00.792\nAnd I just have that CNAME so\nthat it's easy for\n\n371\n00:22:00.792 --> 00:22:04.331\nclients to not have to remember\nall these random IP addresses.\n\n372\n00:22:04.331 --> 00:22:08.240\nThey're just using that www or\nwhatever that host name is.\n\n373\n00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.919\nSo that's one reason\nwhy I would use those.\n\n374\n00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:16.380\nAll right, I'm trying to see how\nbig is this Microsoft list here.\n\n375\n00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.198\nI think it's actually pretty small\ncompared to some of the others.\n\n376\n00:22:19.198 --> 00:22:23.030\nMX, MX are gonna are mail exchange record.\n\n377\n00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.790\nSo that's going to be what we're using\n\n378\n00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:31.930\nwhenever they give examples here,\nwhenever we're using a like exchange.\n\n379\n00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:36.093\nAnd they'll be using those records\nto signify that information.\n\n380\n00:22:36.093 --> 00:22:43.757\nService records, Service records\nare gonna be containing, let's see here.\n\n381\n00:22:43.757 --> 00:22:48.910\nWe've got information for\ntroubleshooting, as well.\n\n382\n00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:52.840\nWe have the service fields,\nspecifies the name of the service.\n\n383\n00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.550\nSuch as if we're running HTTP or Telnet.\n\n384\n00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.112\nSome services are gonna be\ndefined in the standards and\n\n385\n00:22:58.112 --> 00:22:59.622\nothers can be defined locally.\n\n386\n00:22:59.622 --> 00:23:04.090\nYou're gonna have other information\nlike you time to lives, the ports.\n\n387\n00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:06.500\nAnd you can see a couple\nof examples right here.\n\n388\n00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.970\nShows you like they're\nrunning HTTP over TCP.\n\n389\n00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:12.980\nHere we have our fully\nqualified domain name.\n\n390\n00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.480\nSo that's an example of a service record.\n\n391\n00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:20.300\n&gt;&gt; And there's actually very important\nreason why we wanna emphasize the idea of\n\n392\n00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:25.270\nservice record here is because this is\nactually how Active Directory is also\n\n393\n00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.410\ngonna be located inside of your domain,\nas well.\n\n394\n00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, And when you thing about like-\n&gt;&gt; Located domain control, yeah.\n\n395\n00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:31.830\n&gt;&gt; Locating that domain control.\n\n396\n00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.770\nAnd you think about from that\nmanagement perspective, Ronnie.\n\n397\n00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.080\nWhen we just talk about\nour normal A records,\n\n398\n00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.860\nwhich we haven't even\ngotten here on the list.\n\n399\n00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.840\nWhich is weird because I would assume,\nA being at the top of the list.\n\n400\n00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.792\nBut anyhow, our A records are what\nclients are normally using.\n\n401\n00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:50.865\nBut from an IT perspective looking at\nthose service records or even those\n\n402\n00:23:50.865 --> 00:23:55.622\npointer records, they're gonna be more\nhelpful and useful on that side of things.\n\n403\n00:23:55.622 --> 00:23:59.631\nNot really involved in\nthat whole Process that's\n\n404\n00:23:59.631 --> 00:24:04.030\nreally visible from the client side,\nif you will.\n\n405\n00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:08.949\nFor instance, if you're running any kind\nof a lot of types of management software\n\n406\n00:24:08.949 --> 00:24:11.385\nthat's just displaying IP addresses.\n\n407\n00:24:11.385 --> 00:24:14.542\nThat may become an issue\nas an IT manager or\n\n408\n00:24:14.542 --> 00:24:18.786\nemployee within that organization because,\nRonnie,\n\n409\n00:24:18.786 --> 00:24:23.767\ndo you have all our IP addresses\nmemorized for this network here?\n\n410\n00:24:23.767 --> 00:24:24.905\n&gt;&gt; Yes?\nNo I don't.\n\n411\n00:24:24.905 --> 00:24:25.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm joking.\n\n412\n00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.060\n&gt;&gt; I was like what is he gonna say here?\n\n413\n00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.910\nI mean that's a little ridiculous to\nask someone to remember all of that\n\n414\n00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:31.790\ninformation, right?\n\n415\n00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:35.460\nSo some kind of management software and\ntools will go ahead and\n\n416\n00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.060\nmap that using those pointer records.\n\n417\n00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.380\nSo, just kinda keep that pointer\nrecords are not essential.\n\n418\n00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:42.378\nThey're not required.\n\n419\n00:24:42.378 --> 00:24:46.484\nYou are gonna be using those A or\nquad A records but you do have options for\n\n420\n00:24:46.484 --> 00:24:48.756\nadding even additional records here.\n\n421\n00:24:48.756 --> 00:24:50.587\nBut, like I said those\nare just the common.\n\n422\n00:24:50.587 --> 00:24:53.343\nAnd it's kinda strange,\nI've gone through this list and\n\n423\n00:24:53.343 --> 00:24:56.000\nthey're not even on there but\nI'll tell you what it is.\n\n424\n00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.808\nSo A records are just going to\nbe mapping that host name, or\n\n425\n00:24:59.808 --> 00:25:05.270\nI should say that fully qualified domain\nname to an IP address for IPv4 addresses.\n\n426\n00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:09.045\nThey do have under this section here,\nwhat are they listed?\n\n427\n00:25:09.045 --> 00:25:09.818\n&gt;&gt; Quad-As.\n\n428\n00:25:09.818 --> 00:25:13.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and they call it\nLess Common Resource Record Types, and\n\n429\n00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:18.624\nhere you have your Quad-As, your 4As,\nwhatever Same concept that's gonna\n\n430\n00:25:18.624 --> 00:25:23.688\nbe taking that fully qualified domain and\nmapping it to an IPv6 address.\n\n431\n00:25:23.688 --> 00:25:28.461\nAll right, so those are gonna be\nsome of our resource record types.\n\n432\n00:25:28.461 --> 00:25:34.680\nAnd those are gonna be stored within\nour particular our server here.\n\n433\n00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.260\nAnd so for\ninstance we can take a look at a couple.\n\n434\n00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.183\nI know we're running short on time here,\nwe still have a lot to cover.\n\n435\n00:25:40.183 --> 00:25:46.350\nBut even in my little lab environment here\nI have my domain controller, PLABDM01.\n\n436\n00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.770\nMy domain number, you can see\n\n437\n00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:52.860\nthat's the name on the left-hand side\nhere which maps to that IP address.\n\n438\n00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:57.320\nSo that's an example of that particular\nrecord, just simple text based files\n\n439\n00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:02.110\nlike I said the actual syntax,\nthe verbage there.\n\n440\n00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:04.410\nYou can use regular Notepad to modify.\n\n441\n00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:08.726\nAnd it's interchangeable with\nother DNS solutions, as well.\n\n442\n00:26:08.726 --> 00:26:10.430\nAll right.\n\n443\n00:26:11.715 --> 00:26:14.590\nRound-robin, do you think we have time for\nthat Ronnie?\n\n444\n00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:15.920\nTo go ahead and show that.\n\n445\n00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.793\n&gt;&gt; Well, we can actually try and\nshow that but\n\n446\n00:26:17.793 --> 00:26:20.762\nmore then likely, just explain\nthe concept at least at this point,\n\n447\n00:26:20.762 --> 00:26:23.282\nthen we can show it a little\nbit later in another episode.\n\n448\n00:26:23.282 --> 00:26:27.346\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, so\nI'll talk about it like Ronnie said.\n\n449\n00:26:27.346 --> 00:26:32.488\nSo round-robin is going to\nbe an option in which we can\n\n450\n00:26:32.488 --> 00:26:37.860\nkind of take one particular record and\nshare it to create\n\n451\n00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:43.144\nsomething that's called\na poor man's load balance.\n\n452\n00:26:43.144 --> 00:26:46.069\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what you're doing is you're kind of\n\n453\n00:26:46.069 --> 00:26:50.872\nyou're mapping a fully qualified domain\nname to a particular IP address.\n\n454\n00:26:50.872 --> 00:26:57.030\nBut let's say we have like three\ndifferent web servers okay?\n\n455\n00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:00.460\nAnd we wanted to kind of\ncreate load balancing but\n\n456\n00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.900\nwe couldn't afford a load balancer.\n\n457\n00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.146\nSo DNS is something that\nMicrosoft has provided for us so\n\n458\n00:27:05.146 --> 00:27:07.019\nlet's take advantage of that.\n\n459\n00:27:07.019 --> 00:27:12.010\nBut there're some risks associated as\nwell, so I'll tell you about that also.\n\n460\n00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.284\nSo if I were to go ahead and\ntake 3 IP addresses and point them,\n\n461\n00:27:17.284 --> 00:27:21.579\nmap them with an overview resource record,\nlike an A record, to the same fully\n\n462\n00:27:21.579 --> 00:27:25.900\nqualified domain address every time\na client externally, or whomever.\n\n463\n00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.955\nOr trying to type in that fully\nqualified domain name and\n\n464\n00:27:28.955 --> 00:27:30.718\nhave it mapped to an IP address.\n\n465\n00:27:30.718 --> 00:27:35.650\nIt would cycle through the provided\nIP addresses to perform a type\n\n466\n00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:38.980\nof basic load balancing there.\n\n467\n00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:43.690\nThe problem with that though, is you're\njust querying that DNS server for\n\n468\n00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:44.408\nthat record.\n\n469\n00:27:44.408 --> 00:27:48.240\nAnd it's gonna do what it's programmed\nto do and give you that information.\n\n470\n00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:53.054\nIt doesn't harbor or have any other\nkind of information to provide like\n\n471\n00:27:53.054 --> 00:27:56.194\nthe health status of\na particular web server.\n\n472\n00:27:56.194 --> 00:28:00.969\nLike a load balancer would be able\nto provide, or at least handle,\n\n473\n00:28:00.969 --> 00:28:02.520\nin an intuitive way.\n\n474\n00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.760\nSo here If I am cycling\nthrough those IP addresses,\n\n475\n00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:10.230\nthose queries, and\none of those machines are down,\n\n476\n00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:14.410\nthen that client is going to have\nan invalid, it's not gonna maintain that,\n\n477\n00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:18.690\nor create and establish, a connection\nthere because if that server's down.\n\n478\n00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.780\nOur DNS server doesn't know to\ngo ahead and omit or skip it and\n\n479\n00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.000\nmove onto the next one.\n\n480\n00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.397\nSo, it's got its drawbacks there but\nit isn't easy thing we can configure and\n\n481\n00:28:27.397 --> 00:28:30.408\nwe'll go ahead and\nshow you that in the next episode.\n\n482\n00:28:30.408 --> 00:28:33.956\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, well thank you for\nhelping us to get started here,\n\n483\n00:28:33.956 --> 00:28:35.848\ntaking a look at the DNS server role and\n\n484\n00:28:35.848 --> 00:28:39.580\nsome of the different elements\nthat we'll actually end up seeing.\n\n485\n00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:43.040\nThere is still a lot more to go in\nterms of the DNS server role and\n\n486\n00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:47.340\nthings that we also need to know about and\nCherokee's gonna show us that in a Part 2.\n\n487\n00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.650\nBut as of this point,\nit's a great place for use to sign off.\n\n488\n00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:53.680\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n489\n00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.374\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee

00:00:07.811\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.811 --> 00:00:11.524\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.524 --> 00:00:14.730\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.050\nYou're watching\nthe Windows Server 101 show,\n\n7\n00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.306\nwhere we're about to dive into\nManaging DNS Server Role Part 2.\n\n8\n00:00:22.306 --> 00:00:26.243\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and here to\nhelp us to continue on with the idea of\n\n9\n00:00:26.243 --> 00:00:29.118\nthe server role here is gonna be Ms.\nCherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:29.118 --> 00:00:31.120\nCherokee welcome back to the studio.\n\n11\n00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.892\n&gt;&gt; Yeah thanks for having me,\nso we promised our viewers and\n\n12\n00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:37.762\nwe promised you that we would come back\nand show you around Robin Techniques, so\n\n13\n00:00:37.762 --> 00:00:39.232\nthat's what I plan on doing.\n\n14\n00:00:39.232 --> 00:00:43.360\nRemember what it was,\nwe talked about that in the last episode.\n\n15\n00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.181\nWe said that it was kind of like\na poor man's load balancing technique.\n\n16\n00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:50.676\nBut there were some drawbacks,\nsuch as if that particular\n\n17\n00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:55.090\nmachine from one of those IP\naddresses had came offline.\n\n18\n00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.037\nThen you wouldn't be able\nto know that intuitively.\n\n19\n00:00:58.037 --> 00:01:02.385\nSo let's take a look at how we would\nactually configure that here in MyPC.\n\n20\n00:01:02.385 --> 00:01:06.450\nAll right so first things first.\n\n21\n00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.751\nThe zone that we'll be working in here\nfirst for our practicelabs.com zone,\n\n22\n00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:16.750\nwe'll go ahead and take a look at our\nrecords that are already noted here.\n\n23\n00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.230\nWe can see our different machines\nthat are already in our environment.\n\n24\n00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.147\nAnd let's just see.\n\n25\n00:01:23.147 --> 00:01:29.120\n192.168.0.2 is the IP address for\nthis PLABDim01.\n\n26\n00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.094\nSo let's just pretend that this\nis going to be our web server\n\n27\n00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:38.737\nthat we are going to\nenable round robin for.\n\n28\n00:01:38.737 --> 00:01:42.891\nSo what we could do here\nis just go ahead and\n\n29\n00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:46.935\ncreate let me zoom out a little bit here.\n\n30\n00:01:46.935 --> 00:01:51.310\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ncreate a new host, an A or quad-A record.\n\n31\n00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.670\nSo if we take a look at this\ninformation you can see\n\n32\n00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.040\nhere my fully qualified domain name and\nthis is that current IP address.\n\n33\n00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.580\nMy host name is already highlighted so\nI'm just gonna copy and paste that there.\n\n34\n00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.045\nNot show this info again.\n\n35\n00:02:07.045 --> 00:02:10.037\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and create a new\nrecord within this particular zone.\n\n36\n00:02:10.037 --> 00:02:14.070\nSo, we'll say hey we're gonna create a new\nhost record since we're dealing with IPv4.\n\n37\n00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.864\nWe're gonna give it that same name,\nso the PLABDMO1.\n\n38\n00:02:19.864 --> 00:02:23.185\nBut this time let's specify\ndifferent IP address and\n\n39\n00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:27.630\nlet me just see what kind of addressing\nscheme we've got going on here.\n\n40\n00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.350\nIt goes up to, in this lab environment it\nlooks like .0.7 so let's just go ahead and\n\n41\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.600\nspecify 192.168.0 and we'll go ahead and\nkeep with this convention and\n\n42\n00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.380\nselect .8 and hit Add Host all right.\n\n43\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.000\nSo we can see here the host\nrecord was successfully created.\n\n44\n00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.750\nAnd let's go ahead and do that one\nmore time, adding a new IP address for\n\n45\n00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.870\nthat particular host name, or\nfor that qualified domain name.\n\n46\n00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.341\nSo here, we'll just put 192.168.0.9.\n\n47\n00:03:01.341 --> 00:03:01.942\nThat was okay.\n\n48\n00:03:01.942 --> 00:03:08.360\nThat will fit within our design here,\nso we'll hit Add Host, hit OK and Done.\n\n49\n00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.488\nAnd now you can see those two\nadditional records that we\n\n50\n00:03:12.488 --> 00:03:15.102\njust created right here and here.\n\n51\n00:03:15.102 --> 00:03:16.020\nYou can go ahead and\n\n52\n00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.585\nlaunch NS lookup right here from within\nthis management console as well,\n\n53\n00:03:19.585 --> 00:03:23.630\nor if you had PowerShell open or\ncommand prompt, then that would work too.\n\n54\n00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.635\nSo let's go ahead and launch it\nfrom within this environment here.\n\n55\n00:03:28.635 --> 00:03:32.054\nI will change this font a little bit so\nthat we can see it better.\n\n56\n00:03:32.054 --> 00:03:33.055\nThere we go.\n\n57\n00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:38.258\nThe color too.\n\n58\n00:03:38.258 --> 00:03:39.292\nAll right.\n\n59\n00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:45.770\nAll right so we're already in and\nyou're active NS lookup mode here.\n\n60\n00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.420\nSo what I wanna do is I wanna go ahead and\n\n61\n00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.660\nquery that particular hostname\nthat we just were working with.\n\n62\n00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.028\nSo that's gonna be PLABDM01.\n\n63\n00:03:58.028 --> 00:04:00.113\nSo, when I get a response,\n\n64\n00:04:00.113 --> 00:04:04.937\nthis is that first A record that\nwe had noted, that IP address.\n\n65\n00:04:04.937 --> 00:04:08.700\nBut if I just ahead, and\nsend that same query,\n\n66\n00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.400\nnotice the IP address that\nis returned to me this time.\n\n67\n00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.854\nIt's different,\nthis is going to be 192.168.0.8.\n\n68\n00:04:17.854 --> 00:04:21.082\nAnd if I do that again, and\nperform that same function,\n\n69\n00:04:21.082 --> 00:04:23.842\nI'm kind of going off\nscreen here a little bit.\n\n70\n00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:30.102\nBut this time,\nI'm going to get even different,\n\n71\n00:04:30.102 --> 00:04:33.958\nit should just cycle\nthrough those IP addresses.\n\n72\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:39.477\nAnd let me make sure that it's actually\ngoing through and displayed here.\n\n73\n00:04:41.704 --> 00:04:42.565\nThere we go.\n\n74\n00:04:42.565 --> 00:04:46.610\nAll right, so now you can see 192.168.0.9.\n\n75\n00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.542\nSo that's what we mean when\nwe say round robining.\n\n76\n00:04:49.542 --> 00:04:51.640\nSo if you wanted to kind of load balance,\n\n77\n00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.496\nthat's one way that you\ncould perform that function.\n\n78\n00:04:54.496 --> 00:04:58.190\nSo we'll just exit and then exit.\n\n79\n00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.310\nAll right, so that's round robining.\n\n80\n00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.650\nWhat's on our list here, scavenging?\n\n81\n00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.660\nThat's kind of a creepy term?\n\n82\n00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.600\nNot as creepy as you might think.\n\n83\n00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.130\nLet's take a look here\nat my simple diagram.\n\n84\n00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.015\nThere's a lot of information associated\nwith this concept of scavenging,\n\n85\n00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:19.157\nso I wanna just take a second and\ntalk about that.\n\n86\n00:05:19.157 --> 00:05:22.920\nEvery time a resource record is created.\n\n87\n00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.488\nSo here, I have my little resource record.\n\n88\n00:05:25.488 --> 00:05:30.380\nThere's gonna be a time stamp that's\nadded onto that resource record.\n\n89\n00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.093\nSo, To make sure that that\ninformation is fresh and\n\n90\n00:05:35.093 --> 00:05:39.460\nup to date there's communications\nthat transpire within our network.\n\n91\n00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.340\nSo we haven't really talked about dynamic\nupdating with DNS, but what happened\n\n92\n00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.290\nis those clients configured with dynamic\nupdating are going to be reaching out to\n\n93\n00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.080\nthat DNS server to say, hey I'm Still\nhere, this is my information.\n\n94\n00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.010\nSo that's gonna be\ngenerating network traffic.\n\n95\n00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.060\nAnd depending on your\n\n96\n00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.160\namount of bandwidth that you have\navailable within your network.\n\n97\n00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.932\nThat could be something\nthat you're concerned with.\n\n98\n00:06:03.932 --> 00:06:07.682\nSo Microsoft came up with this idea of,\nhey,\n\n99\n00:06:07.682 --> 00:06:12.740\nlet's kind of reduce that flow\nof traffic to set intervals.\n\n100\n00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.527\nSo we have two different intervals here.\n\n101\n00:06:16.527 --> 00:06:21.103\nWe have a no refresh interval and\na refresh interval that assist with\n\n102\n00:06:21.103 --> 00:06:25.036\nscavenging or aging to help\ncreate accurate DNS records so\n\n103\n00:06:25.036 --> 00:06:29.771\nthat there aren't any older,\nstale records within that DNS server,\n\n104\n00:06:29.771 --> 00:06:33.600\nthey're like those records you just saw,\nright.\n\n105\n00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.960\nSo, I really wanted to break these two\nterms out because they're two separate\n\n106\n00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.320\nintervals that Microsoft calls out,\nand those are gonna be settings there.\n\n107\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.627\nSo one is called the No Refresh interval.\n\n108\n00:06:47.627 --> 00:06:51.632\nSo both of these intervals by default are\nset for seven days which are completely\n\n109\n00:06:51.632 --> 00:06:54.670\nconfigurable you can change\nthat if you want to.\n\n110\n00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.450\nBut during this first increment\n\n111\n00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.666\nduring this no refresh interval\nthe default seven days.\n\n112\n00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:05.910\nThen the time stamping information can't\nbe changed but service information\n\n113\n00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:11.710\nsuch as IP addresses and ports can be\nmodified on that particular record.\n\n114\n00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.900\nOnce we exceed that no\nrefresh interval and\n\n115\n00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:20.660\nmove into our refresh interval which\nby default again is another seven days,\n\n116\n00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.728\nI can also I have the ability to\nchange that time stamp information.\n\n117\n00:07:25.728 --> 00:07:30.547\nSo here, I'm not gonna be changing any\nkind of IP address or service information.\n\n118\n00:07:30.547 --> 00:07:36.060\nBut I do have the ability to go ahead and\nchange the time stamp.\n\n119\n00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.982\nSo what I wanted to do is kinda\nbreak that down for you, so just,\n\n120\n00:07:38.982 --> 00:07:42.291\nhere we have an example, let's say\nwe had a record that was created on,\n\n121\n00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:44.301\nwe're going into the future here Ronnie.\n\n122\n00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:45.930\n&gt;&gt; Into the future.\n\n123\n00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.190\n&gt;&gt; So, December 1st of 2017,\n\n124\n00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:53.230\nand we'll keep the defaults let's just\nsay it was created in the morning and so\n\n125\n00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:57.930\nchanges can be made to that particular\nrecord up until December 7 of 2017.\n\n126\n00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:03.440\nBut only time stamp changes can be\nmade thereafter and if no changes have\n\n127\n00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.300\nbeen made by the 14th then the settings\nand, and, that's a big and right here.\n\n128\n00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.952\nI should have made it extra bold.\n\n129\n00:08:09.952 --> 00:08:13.210\nAnd the settings have been\nconfigured correctly.\n\n130\n00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:19.063\nThen the record can be scavenged or\npurged out of that DNS server.\n\n131\n00:08:19.063 --> 00:08:24.982\nAll right, so remember, DNS cache and\nDNS records are two separate things here.\n\n132\n00:08:24.982 --> 00:08:28.541\nCache, volatile,\nwe do have the ability to go ahead and\n\n133\n00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:33.387\nset the TTLs on these caches and I'll\nshow you where and how we could do that,\n\n134\n00:08:33.387 --> 00:08:35.918\nbut it's two separate concepts here.\n\n135\n00:08:35.918 --> 00:08:37.290\nSo scavenging as well.\n\n136\n00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.510\nAll right, so where do we go ahead and\nconfigure that.\n\n137\n00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:45.984\nLet me make sure I reset lab so\nwe don't run out of time here.\n\n138\n00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:47.990\nAnd then we can go ahead and\ntake a look at that.\n\n139\n00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:49.990\nAll right.\n\n140\n00:08:51.984 --> 00:08:54.693\nThere're a lot of different\nminutiae that we have\n\n141\n00:08:54.693 --> 00:08:59.070\nto cover to make sure that this\nprocess is going to happen correctly.\n\n142\n00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.491\nSo, dynamically created records by default\n\n143\n00:09:03.491 --> 00:09:08.036\nare gonna have a particular\ntick box checked.\n\n144\n00:09:08.036 --> 00:09:10.130\nAnd we wont have to go\nthrough this process.\n\n145\n00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.790\nHowever, let's just click on one of these\nrecords that we've manually created just\n\n146\n00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:18.650\na few moments ago like PLABDMO1 for\nthis IP address all right.\n\n147\n00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:23.538\nSo let's go ahead and\ngo to the properties here.\n\n148\n00:09:23.538 --> 00:09:28.082\nI do wanna say, I think by default,\nbecause I had already showed you\n\n149\n00:09:28.082 --> 00:09:32.520\nearlier in this show under view and\nwe had selected advanced.\n\n150\n00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:38.376\nAnd you can see how this little arrow or\ncheck mark is next to advance.\n\n151\n00:09:38.376 --> 00:09:41.355\nIf you right-click on your record, and\n\n152\n00:09:41.355 --> 00:09:46.610\nyou don't have this option here,\nthen you'll need to go under View and\n\n153\n00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.482\ngo to Advanced to get these\noptions present for you.\n\n154\n00:09:50.482 --> 00:09:56.561\nSo just keep that in mind, that's a weird\nlittle coding design that they have there.\n\n155\n00:09:56.561 --> 00:10:00.880\nBut anyways, so\nlet's take a look at a few things here.\n\n156\n00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:07.680\nSo that's interesting, I don't have\nthe timestamp here for my record.\n\n157\n00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.820\nBut this is where that timestamp that\nI just showed on that little diagram.\n\n158\n00:10:11.845 --> 00:10:15.775\nHow they created that information and\nmaintain it?\n\n159\n00:10:15.775 --> 00:10:20.313\nAnd by default here,\nthat's interesting two hours,\n\n160\n00:10:20.313 --> 00:10:25.747\nI thought it was 20 hours for\ndefault for the for the normal TTL.\n\n161\n00:10:25.747 --> 00:10:28.400\nBut here, I have it set for one hour.\n\n162\n00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.670\nThat's not a lot of time, as your TTL\nis going to be the amount of time, your\n\n163\n00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:39.025\ntime to live that this record is saying,\nhey, this is how long that client or\n\n164\n00:10:39.025 --> 00:10:44.575\nwhoever obtains this information should\nretain that within the cache there.\n\n165\n00:10:44.575 --> 00:10:49.786\nAnd you can modify that here,\nbut that's kind of low.\n\n166\n00:10:49.786 --> 00:10:51.801\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so why would we modify it?\n\n167\n00:10:51.801 --> 00:10:55.860\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's a good question Ronnie,\nbecause let's see here.\n\n168\n00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.070\nSo, for this particular situation,\nwe're talking about a web server,\n\n169\n00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:01.670\nthat's where we're going.\n\n170\n00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:05.922\nSo let's say that this web server was\nthe driving force for our little mom and\n\n171\n00:11:05.922 --> 00:11:09.925\npop shop maybe we sold a little widget and\nthat's how we made our money.\n\n172\n00:11:09.925 --> 00:11:14.598\nSo that particular service\nis more important to us\n\n173\n00:11:14.598 --> 00:11:18.726\nthan maybe like Cherokee's laptop right.\n\n174\n00:11:18.726 --> 00:11:23.849\nSo, if I set this lower and\nlets thing about this TTL time so\n\n175\n00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:28.670\nlets say we kept it here at one hour for\nthis web server.\n\n176\n00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:33.484\nWe might choose to do so, but that's\ngonna be generating every hour there's\n\n177\n00:11:33.484 --> 00:11:36.460\ngonna be network\ntrafficking happening here.\n\n178\n00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:43.120\nSo I have to kind of pick and choose what\nI'm sacrificing this network traffic for.\n\n179\n00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.590\nSo for instance, if I change this to 20\nhours, if this was Cherokee's laptop.\n\n180\n00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.970\nI could go ahead and increase that TTL for\n20 hours so that only\n\n181\n00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:56.140\nevery 20 hours would that particular host\nwould be calling out to the DNS to say,\n\n182\n00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.320\nhey, I'm still here, I'm still alive.\n\n183\n00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.240\nBecause if that record had the incorrect,\nor that server had the incorrect record,\n\n184\n00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.390\ntheir incorrect IP address, and\nyou couldn't connect to me,\n\n185\n00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:09.920\nRonnie, big deal,\nthat's only one user, right?\n\n186\n00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.770\nSo, if I wasn't able,\nif I had stale information.\n\n187\n00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:17.892\nSay, I changed the IP address for\nmy web server, and within two\n\n188\n00:12:17.892 --> 00:12:24.282\nhours I should be able to know that\nbecause that information is being updated.\n\n189\n00:12:24.282 --> 00:12:27.648\nYes, they're generating more traffic,\nbut that's just kind of a trade-off or\n\n190\n00:12:27.648 --> 00:12:30.820\nhand-off that you kinda have to\nmake that judgement call with.\n\n191\n00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.811\nSo, same thing goes here for\nyour time stamp information.\n\n192\n00:12:33.811 --> 00:12:36.369\nSo, let's say I'm closing in lets\n\n193\n00:12:36.369 --> 00:12:41.000\nsay we kept those seven day\ndefaults that I just showed you.\n\n194\n00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.412\nAnd I'm in my second interval period\nthey're my refresh interval section and\n\n195\n00:12:46.412 --> 00:12:50.266\nI said you know I wanna go ahead and\nextend my time stamp so\n\n196\n00:12:50.266 --> 00:12:53.552\nthat this information\ncan be retained longer.\n\n197\n00:12:53.552 --> 00:12:57.645\nOr, I could go ahead and shorten that\ntime stamp to purge it out faster for\n\n198\n00:12:57.645 --> 00:12:59.460\nthat particular record.\n\n199\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.260\nAnd that's something discretionary,\n\n200\n00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.820\njust an option that we have the ability\nto go ahead and change there.\n\n201\n00:13:05.092 --> 00:13:06.029\nAll right, so now what do we doe here?\n\n202\n00:13:06.029 --> 00:13:09.528\nSo, we saw our time stamp information.\n\n203\n00:13:09.528 --> 00:13:14.193\nNow there's gonna be this tick box\nright here that says delete this\n\n204\n00:13:14.193 --> 00:13:16.820\nrecord when it becomes stale.\n\n205\n00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:21.330\nSo like I said, by default dynamic\nrecords will have that tick box enable,\n\n206\n00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.290\nmanual records like this one will not, so\n\n207\n00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.080\nwe'll definitely make sure that\nthat that is checked there.\n\n208\n00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.260\nAnd then we'll go ahead and If you wanted\nto keep this window open, you could.\n\n209\n00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.810\nBut we're just gonna go ahead and\nselect OK here.\n\n210\n00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:36.840\n&gt;&gt; So that tick box, essentially, is what\nallows us to scavenge that record, right?\n\n211\n00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's giving it the go-ahead.\n\n212\n00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.305\nBut that's not all we have to do here.\n\n213\n00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:42.090\nThere're a couple other\nthings that we need to do.\n\n214\n00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.679\nWe also need to configure this option for\nthat zone as well.\n\n215\n00:13:45.679 --> 00:13:49.923\nSo If you go ahead and\nright-click on your zone,\n\n216\n00:13:49.923 --> 00:13:55.100\nthen this is going to be\nlisted under Properties.\n\n217\n00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:59.340\nAnd then, they call it here it's\njust going to be under Aging.\n\n218\n00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:03.418\nSo let me zoom in a little bit, so you'll\nsee that's where you're actually gonna be\n\n219\n00:14:03.418 --> 00:14:06.587\nstudying that scavenging here\nunder Properties and then Aging.\n\n220\n00:14:06.587 --> 00:14:09.760\nAnd you'll also need to make sure\nthat this is selected just by making\n\n221\n00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.261\nsure that tick box is selected is not\ngonna be, you're not finished there so\n\n222\n00:14:13.261 --> 00:14:15.170\nit's important to note that.\n\n223\n00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:15.922\nAll right so,\n\n224\n00:14:15.922 --> 00:14:19.630\nhere this is the second tick box that\nyou have to make sure is selected.\n\n225\n00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:24.630\nUp in the top left hand corner it says,\nScavenge stale resource records.\n\n226\n00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.970\nAnd here you can see those\nno refresh interval, again,\n\n227\n00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:33.320\nare seven day default, whereas our\nrefresh interval, seven day default.\n\n228\n00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.870\nAnd then it tells you when you\ncan actually be scavenged.\n\n229\n00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.730\nSo we'll hit OK here.\n\n230\n00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.330\nAnd at this point in\ntime you're good to go.\n\n231\n00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.406\nYou do also have the ability\nto go ahead and right click,\n\n232\n00:14:47.406 --> 00:14:51.939\nand configure it for sets aging and\nscavenging for all zones.\n\n233\n00:14:51.939 --> 00:14:56.692\nIn the past, in older versions\nof Microsoft like Server,\n\n234\n00:14:56.692 --> 00:14:59.319\nI think it was Server 2012.\n\n235\n00:14:59.319 --> 00:15:04.638\nIt was kind of strange how they\nhad it configured because the name\n\n236\n00:15:04.638 --> 00:15:09.280\nwould imply server aging and\nscavenging for all zones.\n\n237\n00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.030\nBut it was only set for\nactive directory zones.\n\n238\n00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.090\nSo just to be on the safe\nside I would go through, and\n\n239\n00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:17.450\nthose first two steps that I showed you,\nI would go in and\n\n240\n00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:21.210\nset them individually like that instead of\njust relying on that one configuration.\n\n241\n00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.580\nBecause, even if you set just\nthat one configuration but\n\n242\n00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.740\nyou don't have the actual\ntickbox to verify.\n\n243\n00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:31.052\nAnd within that particular record it's\nnot going to be set to be purged or\n\n244\n00:15:31.052 --> 00:15:35.025\nscavenged from that DNS server, so\njust keep that in mind as well.\n\n245\n00:15:35.025 --> 00:15:35.890\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee.\n\n246\n00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:36.535\nSo thank you for\n\n247\n00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:39.724\nshowing us the idea of being able to\nscavenged those according to schedule.\n\n248\n00:15:39.724 --> 00:15:43.615\nIs there a way that we can actually\ncontrol that scavenging better such as I\n\n249\n00:15:43.615 --> 00:15:44.819\nwanna do it right now?\n\n250\n00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:48.214\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so good question Ronnie if we\ntake a look at my screen here we can see\n\n251\n00:15:48.214 --> 00:15:50.848\nthat if I go ahead and\nright-click on top of the server.\n\n252\n00:15:50.848 --> 00:15:55.470\nThere's an option to go ahead and\nlet's see here.\n\n253\n00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:59.791\nScavenge stale resource records, so by\nselecting that you're gonna go ahead and\n\n254\n00:15:59.791 --> 00:16:01.555\nforce that scavenging process.\n\n255\n00:16:01.555 --> 00:16:05.094\nAnd I also wanted to\nclarify something here.\n\n256\n00:16:05.094 --> 00:16:09.307\nYou do need to have scavenging\nenabled at the server level as well or\n\n257\n00:16:09.307 --> 00:16:10.745\nit's not gonna work.\n\n258\n00:16:10.745 --> 00:16:14.917\nAnd so in those three places there you\ndefinitely wanna just verify that.\n\n259\n00:16:14.917 --> 00:16:17.890\nAnd I did remember about one\nother thing here, Ronnie.\n\n260\n00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:23.010\nIf we take a look here at those different\nrecords, the reason why we didn't see that\n\n261\n00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:28.140\nTTL or time stamp for those static records\nare records that I had created here.\n\n262\n00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:33.194\nYou see that these ones are missing that\ntime stamp over here in this column and\n\n263\n00:16:33.194 --> 00:16:36.324\nthat's because we had\nmanually created them.\n\n264\n00:16:36.324 --> 00:16:40.511\nBut if we were to select the one right\nabove it, and you can see all those listed\n\n265\n00:16:40.511 --> 00:16:45.090\non the right side here, they do have that\ninformation that's brought in there, but\n\n266\n00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:46.400\nwe just didn't see it.\n\n267\n00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.232\nFrom our end because we had made those.\n\n268\n00:16:49.232 --> 00:16:51.960\nBut I think that's about\nit at this level for\n\n269\n00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:56.290\nDNS when we're talking about\nthese topics and scavenging.\n\n270\n00:16:56.290 --> 00:17:00.200\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, well thank you for\nhelping us here as we take a look at that\n\n271\n00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:06.090\nidea of using round robin to help us\nto set this up for those records,\n\n272\n00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:09.580\nmaking sure of course that we can\ndivide up the resources as we need to.\n\n273\n00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:14.530\nIt is a poor man's type of load balancing,\nbut it can work effectively especially\n\n274\n00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:18.520\nwhen you do have an organization\nhitting that server all at one time.\n\n275\n00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.590\nSo it may be an easy way to do that.\n\n276\n00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:23.390\nAlso the idea of scavenging\nis a good thing for\n\n277\n00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:27.410\nmost Active Directory networks, in the\nvery fact that it allows us not to keep\n\n278\n00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:31.280\nthose stale records which could\npoint to a wrong machine at times.\n\n279\n00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:36.220\nSo getting that set up, remembering it's\nnot only a tick box in one location, but\n\n280\n00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.873\nremembering that you have to\ndo it per record at times,\n\n281\n00:17:38.873 --> 00:17:43.240\nyou may have to do it per the zone and\nmaybe even for the server as well.\n\n282\n00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.860\nAnd that way, getting it configured\nthe way that you want to is a little bit\n\n283\n00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.100\nbeyond what we're gonna see\nright here in Server 101.\n\n284\n00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:52.070\nBut for those of you that are actually\ngoing forward towards your MCSA\n\n285\n00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.280\nyou'll see those settings also there and\n\n286\n00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.830\nyou'll talk about them much more in\ndepth than what we've covered here.\n\n287\n00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:00.201\nBut at least you've been exposed to\nthe idea of scavenging right here as well.\n\n288\n00:18:00.201 --> 00:18:03.026\nAlright, well that's a great place for\nus to take this time and\n\n289\n00:18:03.026 -->

00:00:28.153\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:29.059\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me.\n\n12\n00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:29.953\nHow are you doing today, Ronnie?\n\n13\n00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:34.300\n&gt;&gt; I am almost doing fine today,\nso great to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.090\nCherokee, help us out, DNS is one\nof the biggest topics that we have.\n\n15\n00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.295\nHelp us by giving us\na little bit of a rundown,\n\n16\n00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:45.079\nas we've gone through a lot of DNS so\nfar, and then help us out with the zones.\n\n17\n00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.131\n&gt;&gt; We really have, and\nI know it seems like a lot, but\n\n18\n00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.037\nDNS is a very important topic.\n\n19\n00:00:50.037 --> 00:00:53.117\nSo I just kinda wanna recap some of\nthe topics that we have covered,\n\n20\n00:00:53.117 --> 00:00:55.260\nthat you have learned already.\n\n21\n00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.791\nWe've covered quite a bit, so we've\nlooked at things like name resolution,\n\n22\n00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:04.474\nactually performing, going through that\nprocess and how that actually works.\n\n23\n00:01:04.474 --> 00:01:06.228\nStarting with our route servers and\n\n24\n00:01:06.228 --> 00:01:09.981\nthen propagating all the way down to\nour clients, we've spoke about that.\n\n25\n00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:13.131\nWe've also looked at the different\nkinds of queries out there,\n\n26\n00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:16.937\nrecursive versus iterative queries,\nand the differences between the two.\n\n27\n00:01:16.937 --> 00:01:21.719\nWe've also talked about manual\nways in which we can override\n\n28\n00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:26.312\nthis DNS process with our host file and\nour LAN host file for\n\n29\n00:01:26.312 --> 00:01:32.100\nolder naming systems,\nlike utilizing BIOS with our Win servers.\n\n30\n00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.261\nWe've also talked about caching on both\nthe client side as well as the server\n\n31\n00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:40.226\nside, and how we can clear out our cache,\nwhy we would want to do that, or\n\n32\n00:01:40.226 --> 00:01:43.763\nwhy we wouldn't want to go ahead and\nclear out the entire cache.\n\n33\n00:01:43.763 --> 00:01:48.700\nWe've also talked about different\ntypes of tools that we can use.\n\n34\n00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.853\nOf course you guys have seen us, through\nthe DNS server manager, using the GUI,\n\n35\n00:01:52.853 --> 00:01:54.883\nwe've used a lot of PowerShell so far.\n\n36\n00:01:54.883 --> 00:01:59.755\nWe've talked about using older commands\nthat have been around within your command\n\n37\n00:01:59.755 --> 00:02:00.319\nprompt.\n\n38\n00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.754\nWe can even import those into our,\nand use them within PowerShell.\n\n39\n00:02:03.754 --> 00:02:08.261\nDNS, CMD, we even spoke about\ndifferent operating systems and\n\n40\n00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:11.320\ntools that they may be able to use.\n\n41\n00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.141\nWe also talked about using\nthe DNS server service,\n\n42\n00:02:14.141 --> 00:02:18.671\nwe've looked at different things like\nforwarders and conditional forwarders,\n\n43\n00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:22.621\nand we're gonna kind of bring that\ninto this discussion today as well.\n\n44\n00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:26.812\nAnd we've spoke about round robin and\nscavenging, and\n\n45\n00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:31.016\nthen also looking at,\ntalking about different zones.\n\n46\n00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:34.956\nBut that's where we're going to\nstart today, is really defining and\n\n47\n00:02:34.956 --> 00:02:36.705\ndiscussing different zones.\n\n48\n00:02:36.705 --> 00:02:39.050\nThere are gonna be four\ndifferent types of zones.\n\n49\n00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.623\nSo we've got our primary, and then\nprimary with Active Directory integrated.\n\n50\n00:02:44.623 --> 00:02:49.900\nAlthough people really don't say primary\nwith Active Directory integrated.\n\n51\n00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.040\nYou really wanna distinguish the\ndifference between a primary standard and\n\n52\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.400\na primary with\nActive Directory integrated.\n\n53\n00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.668\nSo normally people will just say\nActive Directory integrated, so those two.\n\n54\n00:03:00.668 --> 00:03:05.033\nYou also have secondary, and\nthen we will also cover stub zones.\n\n55\n00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:09.519\nSo let's go ahead and start at\nthe beginning with standard primary zones.\n\n56\n00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.746\nSo if we could go ahead and take a look\nat my screen, that would be great.\n\n57\n00:03:12.746 --> 00:03:16.681\nAnd I know this doesn't seem like\nvery a lot of information here, so\n\n58\n00:03:16.681 --> 00:03:20.010\nI'm gonna try to explain this\nto you as best as I can here.\n\n59\n00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.556\nRonnie, have you ever been to a social\nsetting where, maybe like a barbecue or\n\n60\n00:03:25.556 --> 00:03:31.117\nsomething like that, and there's always\nthis one loud, obnoxious person?\n\n61\n00:03:31.117 --> 00:03:34.217\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm probably the loud,\nobnoxious person.\n\n62\n00:03:34.217 --> 00:03:36.179\n&gt;&gt; I know, me too,\nI probably am that person, too.\n\n63\n00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:39.829\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes I have.\n\n64\n00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.939\n&gt;&gt; Let's just say we got really lucky,\nyou and I were both at this same event.\n\n65\n00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.702\nThere were two loud and obnoxious people,\nand then, let's say you were to go\n\n66\n00:03:48.702 --> 00:03:52.751\nahead and approach Ronnie and I,\nand you had to use the restroom.\n\n67\n00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:55.933\nAnd you said, hey guys,\nwhere's the restroom?\n\n68\n00:03:55.933 --> 00:03:58.646\nAnd Ronnie starts yelling at you,\nI start yelling at you.\n\n69\n00:03:58.646 --> 00:04:02.895\nAnd the thing is, I tell you, you gotta go\ndown the hall, and Ronnie said no, no, no,\n\n70\n00:04:02.895 --> 00:04:05.287\nthat one's out of order,\nyou have to go upstairs.\n\n71\n00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:08.511\nAnd you just start to get confused and\nit's just too much, and\n\n72\n00:04:08.511 --> 00:04:09.814\nthings start to happen.\n\n73\n00:04:09.814 --> 00:04:13.031\nAnd hopefully you don't have an accident,\nright?\n\n74\n00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:17.222\nSo that's not what we want to have\nhappen when we're talking about DNS.\n\n75\n00:04:17.222 --> 00:04:21.470\nSo, [LAUGH] Ronnie's laughing at me here,\nhold on, I'm going somewhere with this,\n\n76\n00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.063\nI promise.\n\n77\n00:04:22.063 --> 00:04:23.723\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you are, literally.\n\n78\n00:04:23.723 --> 00:04:26.534\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if we can look back at my screen,\n\n79\n00:04:26.534 --> 00:04:30.155\nthat's what we don't want to have\nhappen when we're talking about DNS.\n\n80\n00:04:30.155 --> 00:04:32.314\nSo if I had two individuals, or\n\n81\n00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:36.966\ntwo primary zones in which clients\nwere requesting information,\n\n82\n00:04:36.966 --> 00:04:42.381\nthey're not always going to be synched\nup and contain the same information.\n\n83\n00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:45.751\nSo I might get conflicting information,\nso that's not something we want to have,\n\n84\n00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:47.303\nit's not even something we can have.\n\n85\n00:04:47.303 --> 00:04:50.260\nSo by the architecture here is,\n\n86\n00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.978\nwe're going to go ahead and\nhave one primary zone.\n\n87\n00:04:54.978 --> 00:04:57.447\nAnd a zone, if you think about it, so\n\n88\n00:04:57.447 --> 00:05:02.760\nit's a DNS server that contains a rule\nset of how information is shared.\n\n89\n00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.569\nAnd that's kinda what that term means,\na zone.\n\n90\n00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.933\nSo if you think about it like that, so\n\n91\n00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:12.824\nhere I have my primary zone,\nI can only have one here.\n\n92\n00:05:12.824 --> 00:05:17.551\nNow this is a read, write, copy, and\nthat's important because when we\n\n93\n00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:22.276\ntalk about our secondary zones,\nthose are only going to be read copies,\n\n94\n00:05:22.276 --> 00:05:25.859\nbecause I don't want\nconflicts within information.\n\n95\n00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:30.887\nSo I wanna make sure the information that\nI'm giving out is true and accurate.\n\n96\n00:05:30.887 --> 00:05:33.927\nSo let's say this\nindividual PC right here,\n\n97\n00:05:33.927 --> 00:05:37.760\nthis client had some kind\nof IP address change.\n\n98\n00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.337\nSo they would go ahead,\nany kind of information change,\n\n99\n00:05:41.337 --> 00:05:43.505\nI would send to this primary zone.\n\n100\n00:05:43.505 --> 00:05:48.067\nThis is the read, write, copy, so\nthis is where those changes would happen.\n\n101\n00:05:48.067 --> 00:05:52.994\nFrom that, my primary zone\nwould propagate those changes\n\n102\n00:05:52.994 --> 00:05:56.725\nto secondary zones within my environment.\n\n103\n00:05:56.725 --> 00:06:01.351\nAnd that helps because end\nusers could go ahead and\n\n104\n00:06:01.351 --> 00:06:05.547\nreceive information from secondary zones.\n\n105\n00:06:05.547 --> 00:06:09.800\nBut then they would be able to\nsend their changes to the primary.\n\n106\n00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.970\nSo we're kind of offsetting\nthat work balance or\n\n107\n00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.400\nthat load there, so we're implementing\na form of load balancing here.\n\n108\n00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.995\nIf you think about it,\nwe're also implementing fault tolerance,\n\n109\n00:06:23.995 --> 00:06:29.328\nbecause if this machine were to go down,\nokay, well, who would be affected?\n\n110\n00:06:29.328 --> 00:06:33.098\nWell, anyone who wanted to make a machine\nwould not be able to make a machine,\n\n111\n00:06:33.098 --> 00:06:34.200\na change, excuse me,\n\n112\n00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.692\nanyone would not be able to make a change\nto this machine if it were down.\n\n113\n00:06:37.692 --> 00:06:42.504\nBut they still would be able to\nobtain DNS information while that\n\n114\n00:06:42.504 --> 00:06:47.800\nprimary was down, because there\nare copies of the secondaries.\n\n115\n00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.152\nSo, I don't know if that makes sense, but\nit's a good start for you, because we're\n\n116\n00:06:52.152 --> 00:06:55.676\ngonna go through and look at how we\ncan go ahead and set all of these up.\n\n117\n00:06:55.676 --> 00:06:58.687\nAnd just make sure that this\nconcept is really there for\n\n118\n00:06:58.687 --> 00:07:00.329\nyou because it is important.\n\n119\n00:07:01.884 --> 00:07:05.618\nAll right, let's go ahead and\n\n120\n00:07:05.618 --> 00:07:10.320\ntake a look at my machine here again.\n\n121\n00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.606\nAnd let's see what machine\nare we working with.\n\n122\n00:07:17.286 --> 00:07:22.760\nAll right, so this is going to be\ndomain controller, plabdc01, and what\n\n123\n00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:28.422\nI wanna do at this time is, I wanna go\nahead and create a standard primary zone.\n\n124\n00:07:28.422 --> 00:07:34.419\nSo I can go ahead and\npull up my DNS Management Console here.\n\n125\n00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:40.526\nAnd currently, I can see that I\ndo have my machine listed here.\n\n126\n00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:44.950\nBut we can just right-click on\ntop of that, and select New Zone.\n\n127\n00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.682\nAnd it brings up a wizard for\nus, which is really nice.\n\n128\n00:07:49.682 --> 00:07:54.993\nIt's really easy to go ahead and\nset these up, so we're just going to go\n\n129\n00:07:54.993 --> 00:08:01.031\nthrough this to make sure you understand,\nand let me zoom in a little bit for you.\n\n130\n00:08:01.031 --> 00:08:03.004\nDid that zoom?\n\n131\n00:08:03.004 --> 00:08:04.730\nNo, okay, there we go.\n\n132\n00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:09.201\nSo this is a very small portion\ndown here but it's very important.\n\n133\n00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:13.123\nIt's almost like, you really want to\npay attention here because it says,\n\n134\n00:08:13.123 --> 00:08:15.760\nwhat kind of zone are you going to create?\n\n135\n00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.350\nAnd these are the different types\nof zones that I mentioned to you.\n\n136\n00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:23.000\nOur primary zone,\nour secondary zone, our stub zone.\n\n137\n00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.880\nBut that primary zone integrated\nwith Active Directory,\n\n138\n00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.150\nthis is that check box down here\nthat you wanna be cognizant of.\n\n139\n00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.830\nCurrently I'm gonna uncheck that,\n\n140\n00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.760\nbecause we're not creating\nan Active Directory Integrated Zone,\n\n141\n00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.880\nwe'll speak more on that later,\nwe're creating a standard zone.\n\n142\n00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.480\nAll right, so we'll just hit Next.\n\n143\n00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:46.060\nI will also show you how to create\na reverse lookup zone, but remember,\n\n144\n00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.080\nforward lookup zones are going\nto be taking that hostname and\n\n145\n00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.380\nresolving that to IP addresses.\n\n146\n00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.059\nReverse lookup zones are simply\nthe transverse, the opposite of that so\n\n147\n00:08:55.059 --> 00:08:56.273\nwe'll do that as well.\n\n148\n00:08:56.273 --> 00:08:57.895\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, so\n\n149\n00:08:57.895 --> 00:09:02.629\nwhat is the advantage of not having\nthat active directory integrated zone?\n\n150\n00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:04.534\nSo you mentioned this also here,\n\n151\n00:09:04.534 --> 00:09:08.780\nthat you're unchecking that because\nyou don't want to create that.\n\n152\n00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.580\nIs there any advantage to doing that?\n\n153\n00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.048\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it really depends\non your organization's needs.\n\n154\n00:09:14.048 --> 00:09:18.876\nSo it's really beneficial to use\nActive Directory integrated zones and\n\n155\n00:09:18.876 --> 00:09:20.920\nwe'll speak more upon that.\n\n156\n00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.180\nBut let's say for instance you didn't want\nmaybe you had a DNS server on the edge of\n\n157\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.862\nyour network in the perimeter.\n\n158\n00:09:26.862 --> 00:09:30.948\nAnd you didn't want to potentially\nexpose if you think about\n\n159\n00:09:30.948 --> 00:09:34.312\nit Active Directory our\ndatabases they house a lot\n\n160\n00:09:34.312 --> 00:09:38.654\nof very important information\nabout the design of our network.\n\n161\n00:09:38.654 --> 00:09:41.820\nThat clients and that computers,\nand my policies.\n\n162\n00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.900\nAnd you don't want that sensitive\ninformation to be at risk.\n\n163\n00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:51.530\nSo also, with our standard zones,\n\n164\n00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.620\nit's nice because I'm not married\nto any one operating system.\n\n165\n00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.739\nI can have a Linux,\na Unix system running a standard zone.\n\n166\n00:10:00.739 --> 00:10:05.030\nAnd it's going to be compatible\nwith my Windows operating systems.\n\n167\n00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:09.286\nSo if I had a mixed environment,\nI may also wanna go ahead and opt for\n\n168\n00:10:09.286 --> 00:10:11.110\nthis standard zone option.\n\n169\n00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.090\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good.\n\n170\n00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:17.190\n&gt;&gt; All right so we'll go ahead and hit\nnext here, for our forward look-up zone.\n\n171\n00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:24.736\nAnd we'll just call this one ITPro, Demo.\n\n172\n00:10:24.736 --> 00:10:26.100\nAll right, and we can hit next.\n\n173\n00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.323\nNow, I could put,\nyou know, IT Pro Demo.com.\n\n174\n00:10:32.323 --> 00:10:36.830\nI want to show you just so you can see,\nwhat happens here on this next page.\n\n175\n00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:41.210\nSo, what's actually happening here\nis we're creating a zone file and\n\n176\n00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:46.106\nthat's another difference of where this\ninformation is stored and retained.\n\n177\n00:10:46.106 --> 00:10:48.070\nWhat I'm doing right now\nis I'm creating a file.\n\n178\n00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:48.700\nThis is my zone.\n\n179\n00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.820\nRemember how I told you zones were\nlike rule sets of how we're sharing\n\n180\n00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.870\ninformation.\n\n181\n00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.313\nSo that information is stored\non my local hard drive, and\n\n182\n00:10:56.313 --> 00:10:59.839\nyou can see that file extension\nhere is going to be a .dns.\n\n183\n00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:02.311\nAnd we'll take a look at that in a moment,\n\n184\n00:11:02.311 --> 00:11:07.560\nto show you how we can modify that\nmanually, it's a very simple type of file.\n\n185\n00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:13.690\nSo, here we see that, and we'll hit Next.\n\n186\n00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.560\nNow this portion,\nmy first radial button is grayed out,\n\n187\n00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:22.478\nbecause I only can select to allow\nsecure dynamic updates if I select this\n\n188\n00:11:22.478 --> 00:11:25.637\nzone to be integrated\nwith active directory.\n\n189\n00:11:25.637 --> 00:11:28.648\nBecause this zone is not\nintegrated with active directory,\n\n190\n00:11:28.648 --> 00:11:30.610\nit's not even an option for me.\n\n191\n00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.240\nSo let's take a look at\nwhat could be my options.\n\n192\n00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:38.790\nSo here it says, allow both non secure and\nsecure dynamic updates.\n\n193\n00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.855\nSo if I'm allowing secure and non-secure.\n\n194\n00:11:41.855 --> 00:11:45.450\nFrom a security perspective,\nthat's not secure.\n\n195\n00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.760\nBecause we're allowing non-secure updates.\n\n196\n00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.760\nSo, at this particular point in time,\n\n197\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.420\nI don't have any kind of with\nmy standard primary zones.\n\n198\n00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.770\nI don't have any kind of encryption,\nany kind of security that I can implement.\n\n199\n00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.470\nAs a matter of fact there\nis a caveat to that.\n\n200\n00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:06.440\nI will say there's nothing\ninnately configured.\n\n201\n00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.050\nI don't have anything natively configured\nthat will allow me to do that.\n\n202\n00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:14.940\nIf I was running Unix,\nI think there's crypt DNS and\n\n203\n00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.390\nthere are third-party utilities, but\nthat's a whole 'nother ball game.\n\n204\n00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.710\nSo for right now,\nInstead of being unsecure,\n\n205\n00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.390\nbecause I don't have\nany kind of encryption.\n\n206\n00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:28.375\nWe'll talk more about this when we look\nat zone transfers and dynamic updates.\n\n207\n00:12:28.375 --> 00:12:33.152\nI'm just gonna say don't allow these\ndynamic updates because I'll just\n\n208\n00:12:33.152 --> 00:12:33.930\nsay it now.\n\n209\n00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.050\nWhat a dynamic update is,\nif you think about this,\n\n210\n00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:39.290\nlet's say I had 100 clients\nwithin my environment.\n\n211\n00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:46.070\nAll right certain clients you're not gonna\nwant to have IP addresses static on.\n\n212\n00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.405\nRight, like work stations.\n\n213\n00:12:47.405 --> 00:12:49.430\nWe use DHCP for that.\n\n214\n00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:55.976\nBut some devices like printers, servers\nyou will create static IP addresses for.\n\n215\n00:12:55.976 --> 00:12:57.410\nSo for those dynamically.\n\n216\n00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:16.380\nIf anyone can contact that DNS server,\nthey can intercept\n\n217\n00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.790\nthat communication and/or poison or\nspoof it, and say hey, I have a change,\n\n218\n00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:25.130\nwhen in all actuality, that change\ncould be malicious and not true.\n\n219\n00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:29.776\nSo, what I'm gonna do is just select\ndo not allow dynamic updates from\n\n220\n00:13:29.776 --> 00:13:31.282\nhappening right now.\n\n221\n00:13:31.282 --> 00:13:33.660\nSo we'll hit Next and then Finish.\n\n222\n00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.977\nAnd really that was it,\nit was that simple.\n\n223\n00:13:38.977 --> 00:13:43.660\nIf I expand out here you can see\nunder my forward lookup zones I now\n\n224\n00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.870\nhave the ITPro demo.\n\n225\n00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:50.070\nAnd let's just go ahead and\ncreate a couple a records here.\n\n226\n00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:54.030\nLet's say Client 01, and\n\n227\n00:13:54.030 --> 00:14:02.286\nwe'll give it the IP\naddress of 192.168.0.6.\n\n228\n00:14:02.286 --> 00:14:06.285\nAnd if you select this portion right\nhere remember you can create those\n\n229\n00:14:06.285 --> 00:14:08.063\nassociated pointer records.\n\n230\n00:14:08.063 --> 00:14:10.967\nWe can go ahead and add that host.\n\n231\n00:14:10.967 --> 00:14:14.100\nI did not create my reverse lookup zone,\nthough.\n\n232\n00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.760\nSo we're not going to, we'll do that next.\n\n233\n00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:24.132\nBut we'll just say client 01,\nand the IP address,\n\n234\n00:14:24.132 --> 00:14:29.519\nwhat did we say, 192.168.0.6.\n\n235\n00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:32.362\nAdd the host.\n\n236\n00:14:32.362 --> 00:14:33.931\n&gt;&gt; I think you already got six.\n\n237\n00:14:33.931 --> 00:14:34.672\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n238\n00:14:34.672 --> 00:14:35.330\n&gt;&gt; Should be seven.\n\n239\n00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's go ahead and put that\nin there, seven, let's add a seven.\n\n240\n00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:42.931\nWe'll create two and let's say client 02.\n\n241\n00:14:42.931 --> 00:14:44.416\nSo we'll put a couple of them in there.\n\n242\n00:14:44.416 --> 00:14:46.021\nThere we go, all right, cool.\n\n243\n00:14:46.021 --> 00:14:48.060\nSo that'll work for now.\n\n244\n00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.580\nOkay, so\nnow we have our standard primary zone,\n\n245\n00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.560\nwe've just added a couple of clients\nin here, a couple of A Records.\n\n246\n00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.651\nAnd let's go ahead and\ncreate that reverse zone while we're here.\n\n247\n00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:02.435\nJust go ahead and do that.\n\n248\n00:15:02.435 --> 00:15:06.345\nAnd so you just right click and\nthen you're going to select new zone.\n\n249\n00:15:06.345 --> 00:15:09.625\nAnd again you've got a wizard for\nthat, we've got wizards for\n\n250\n00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:10.745\neverything here within the GUI.\n\n251\n00:15:10.745 --> 00:15:14.135\nBut just know you do have those tools that\nwe spoke about that you can use within\n\n252\n00:15:14.135 --> 00:15:15.215\npowershell.\n\n253\n00:15:15.215 --> 00:15:18.985\nSo let's go ahead and\nzoom in again, and we'll hit next.\n\n254\n00:15:22.166 --> 00:15:25.022\nNow, this is also going to be\na primary zone, but remember,\n\n255\n00:15:25.022 --> 00:15:27.270\nwe're working with\nstandard zones right now.\n\n256\n00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:31.720\nSo I wanna verify that this portion\nis unchecked, and I'm gonna hit next.\n\n257\n00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.970\nNow, for our reverse lookup zones,\n\n258\n00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.400\nyou have a couple different options when\nyou're inputting the information here.\n\n259\n00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.031\nSo first, it's going to ask\nif you want IPv4 or IPv6.\n\n260\n00:15:42.031 --> 00:15:44.260\nSo let's stick with IPV4 and hit next.\n\n261\n00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:47.619\nNow this is kind of cool.\n\n262\n00:15:47.619 --> 00:15:51.759\nLet's say that my network ID, and if you\nguys recall from a previous episode where\n\n263\n00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:54.832\nwe were looking at subnetting,\nwe spoke about network IDs.\n\n264\n00:15:54.832 --> 00:16:01.027\nLet's just say my network\nID is 192.168.0.0.\n\n265\n00:16:01.027 --> 00:16:03.834\nSo if you look at this portion right here,\n\n266\n00:16:03.834 --> 00:16:08.748\nyou can see how they really just,\nit's the opposite, the transverse.\n\n267\n00:16:08.748 --> 00:16:13.830\nIt goes 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa.\n\n268\n00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:18.400\nAnd so that's going to be how that's\nwritten for our reverse lookup zone there,\n\n269\n00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.740\nso we'll go ahead and hit Next.\n\n270\n00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.580\nSo you can see that's what it is\ngoing to be for the file name.\n\n271\n00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.110\nYou could also use a preexisting file,\nbut we've just created this one.\n\n272\n00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:29.520\nSo we'll hit Next.\n\n273\n00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.030\nAnd again, this is the same option\nthat we just spoke about, so\n\n274\n00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:36.360\nI'm going to leave it the same here\nwith that permission or that's,\n\n275\n00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.880\nwe're going to go ahead and\nblock those dynamic updates.\n\n276\n00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.530\nAnd we'll hit Next and Finish.\n\n277\n00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:47.336\nAll right, so if I wanted to create other\nclients at this point, I could include\n\n278\n00:16:47.336 --> 00:16:51.589\nthose pointer records because now,\nthat reverse record is created.\n\n279\n00:16:51.589 --> 00:16:55.060\nAll right, so\nwhat's next on our list here?\n\n280\n00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.190\nSo we looked at primary,\nbut what about secondary?\n\n281\n00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:02.390\nIf you think about that diagram I\nwas showing you, let's go ahead and\n\n282\n00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.680\ncreate a secondary zone.\n\n283\n00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.197\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee as we create this\nsecondary zone that we're about to do you\n\n284\n00:17:08.197 --> 00:17:11.226\nmentioned the idea here that it may\nbe actually on a domain member,\n\n285\n00:17:11.226 --> 00:17:13.630\nany other restrictions that\nwe have to worry about?\n\n286\n00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:39.220\n&gt;&gt; So if we take a look at my screen,\nI've switched over to that PLABDM01.\n\n287\n00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:47.440\nWe do need to know the IP address of our,\nwhomever we're receiving that copy from.\n\n288\n00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.456\nSo the IP address is going to be\nneeded here but let's go ahead and,\n\n289\n00:17:51.456 --> 00:17:53.982\nI've pre-installed DNS on this machine\n\n290\n00:18:12.071 --> 00:18:16.370\nHere you can see that we\nwill select secondary zone.\n\n291\n00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.880\nAlso, note that\n\n292\n00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.680\nthis portion here is grayed out where it\nsays store the zone in Active Directory\n\n293\n00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:27.230\nwhich is available only if DNS server\nis a writable domain controller, and\n\n294\n00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.500\nthat's what we are just talking about\nRonnie, this is not a domain controller.\n\n295\n00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:35.300\nThis is just a domain member, so that's\nwhy we don't have that option as well.\n\n296\n00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.720\nAnd it's kind of silly if\nyou think about it and\n\n297\n00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.680\nit'll make more sense when we talk\nabout Active Directory integrated.\n\n298\n00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.270\nBecause there's really not a need for\n\n299\n00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.500\nsecondary zones when you're\nusing Active Directory.\n\n300\n00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:49.880\nSo we'll go ahead and hit Next and\nthis is gonna be our forward lookup zone.\n\n301\n00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.540\nAnd the name of the zone is itprodemo.\n\n302\n00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.530\nI think we put .com there and\nwe'll hit Next.\n\n303\n00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.950\nAnd this is going to be\nmy master DNS server.\n\n304\n00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:06.810\nSo this means who am I gonna be obtaining\na copy of this information from?\n\n305\n00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.100\nBecause remember this is\nonly a readable copy.\n\n306\n00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.610\nI'm not gonna be able\nto write to this zone.\n\n307\n00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.500\nSo I could be obtaining this\nfrom another secondary which\n\n308\n00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.461\nis getting it from a primary,\nor from a primary directly.\n\n309\n00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:19.600\nAnd that's what I wanna\ndo in this situation.\n\n310\n00:19:40.409 --> 00:19:45.070\nAnd we'll hit Enter, and it'll go\nahead and attempt to resolve here.\n\n311\n00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.350\nIf I pull this out, you can see.\n\n312\n00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:50.360\nAnd then eventually, it does propagate in,\nand it has that information, and so\n\n313\n00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.250\nwe'll go ahead and hit Next and\nFinish, and really, that's it.\n\n314\n00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:01.010\nNow, when we look at this forward lookup\nzone we see that it's listed here.\n\n315\n00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:05.840\nIt says zone not loaded by DNS server and\nit's not that we've done\n\n316\n00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:10.700\nsomething wrong here but\nthis a security feature to prevent\n\n317\n00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.710\nanyone from attaining information\nwithout authorization.\n\n318\n00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.790\nSo what we need to do is another step.\n\n319\n00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:22.660\nWe'll go ahead an hop back\non to that primary to grant\n\n320\n00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:26.790\npermission if you will for the secondary\nto obtain a copy of it's information.\n\n321\n00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.380\nBecause it says hey I\ndon't know who you are.\n\n322\n00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.320\nWhy would I just be\nrandomly giving out and\n\n323\n00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.304\nif you think about it DNS this\nis sensitive information,\n\n324\n00:20:33.304 --> 00:20:36.380\nit contains that resolution of\nyour host names and IP addresses.\n\n325\n00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.180\nWe don't wanna share that with everyone.\n\n326\n00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:43.590\nSo let's go back and\nswitch on over to, let's see here.\n\n327\n00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:48.420\nI just wanna verify under my local server\nthat this is my domain controller,\n\n328\n00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.440\nand you can see that noted here.\n\n329\n00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.328\nAnd so we'll pull up that DNS console\nthat I just closed out of and\n\n330\n00:20:54.328 --> 00:20:56.277\nwe'll grant that permission.\n\n331\n00:20:58.678 --> 00:21:03.557\nSo under our forward lookup zones here,\nlet's go ahead and, wait a second,\n\n332\n00:21:03.557 --> 00:21:07.400\nI think we go here to right click and\nthen select properties.\n\n333\n00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.088\nI was clicking on the wrong one,\nand let me zoom in for you.\n\n334\n00:21:11.088 --> 00:21:13.694\nNow, under our.\n\n335\n00:21:16.353 --> 00:21:20.580\nHold on, I think I'm in the wrong,\nI should have my zone transfers tab.\n\n336\n00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.660\nThat's what I'm looking for here.\n\n337\n00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:22.408\nGive me one second.\n\n338\n00:21:22.408 --> 00:21:27.280\nAll right, ITprodemoco.\n\n339\n00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.580\nIf I expand it out either this way and\nthen click on it, or the other way.\n\n340\n00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.410\nThis is where I wanna be, properties here.\n\n341\n00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:36.870\nSorry about that guys, and\nthis is what I'm looking for.\n\n342\n00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.940\nLet me zoom in, Zone Transfers,\nthis is where you wanna be.\n\n343\n00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:45.100\nBecause this is where I'm specifying who\nI'm allowing these zone transfer to go to.\n\n344\n00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.390\nNow this first option to any server,\nthis is really just a bad idea.\n\n345\n00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.080\nBecause like I just explained,\n\n346\n00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.180\nyou don't wanna be giving\nthat to just anyone randomly.\n\n347\n00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.990\nNow, only to servers listed\non the main server's tab.\n\n348\n00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.840\nYou do have the option under\nthis tab to list servers\n\n349\n00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.820\nwho you want to share this\ninformation with, you may include or\n\n350\n00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:11.655\nexclude certain DNS servers within your\nenvironment for ACL type purposes.\n\n351\n00:22:11.655 --> 00:22:17.825\nBut for this demo what I'll do is just\nsay okay only to the following servers.\n\n352\n00:22:17.825 --> 00:22:21.805\nNow I didn't check but I think I know\nthe IP address for our domain member.\n\n353\n00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.910\nBut you know what it's probably\na good idea to verify that.\n\n354\n00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:27.600\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n355\n00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.690\nSo on our domain member\nlet me just go back here.\n\n356\n00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:34.280\nAnd remember this is the one that we\nwant that zone file to be pulled into.\n\n357\n00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.090\nBut let's just pull up PowerShell and\ndo an ipconfig.\n\n358\n00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:39.459\nAnd I know this is really small here.\n\n359\n00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.350\nBut I'll tell you the IP address for\nthis machine is 192.168.0.3.\n\n360\n00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:47.930\nSo that's important to make\nsure we get that correct.\n\n361\n00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:55.427\nAnd we'll come back over here and\ninput that IP address right here.\n\n362\n00:22:55.427 --> 00:22:58.832\n192.168.0.3.\n\n363\n00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:04.010\nAll right now you do\nsee a red mark here but\n\n364\n00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.530\nthat's okay that's just how it works for\nsome reason.\n\n365\n00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.430\nIt will actually work we'll hit OK.\n\n366\n00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.090\nAll right and then OK.\n\n367\n00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.700\nAnd you can see that it does resolve and\n\n368\n00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:18.580\nit sees that PLABDMO2 that\nis the correct IP address.\n\n369\n00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.660\nAll right, so\nnow that we've granted permission let's go\n\n370\n00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:26.690\nback to that domain member and there's one\nmore step that we need to perform here.\n\n371\n00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.510\nSo this is that error that well\nwe had seen before saying hey\n\n372\n00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:33.100\nwe're not allowing you to\nhave that zone information.\n\n373\n00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.520\nNow I can go ahead and\n\n374\n00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.160\nright click on top of that zone and\nselect transfer from master.\n\n375\n00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.270\nNow, this is gonna take a second,\n\n376\n00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:45.790\nespecially depending on the size\nin that particular zone.\n\n377\n00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:50.686\nWe don't have a lot noted here, but you'll\nsee that it still does take a few moments,\n\n378\n00:23:50.686 --> 00:23:52.669\neven if I go up under my action tab.\n\n379\n00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:54.212\nThis information is grayed here,\n\n380\n00:23:54.212 --> 00:23:57.734\ngrayed out because it's actually\nperforming this action, the background.\n\n381\n00:23:57.734 --> 00:24:02.022\nBut just give it a second and\nyou may even need to hit refresh.\n\n382\n00:24:02.022 --> 00:24:06.960\nAnd you'll see that option\ncome back whenever it's ready.\n\n383\n00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.470\nSee now how the refresh option is there?\n\n384\n00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.160\nAnd it wasn't there\njust a few seconds ago.\n\n385\n00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:15.398\nNow if I hit refresh,\nI can see the information propagate.\n\n386\n00:24:15.398 --> 00:24:19.840\nThese are gonna be the clients we had\ncreated previously from our primary zone.\n\n387\n00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.360\nBut I do wanna show you something.\n\n388\n00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.145\nLet's say let's go ahead and\nclick on Client01.\n\n389\n00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:29.630\nWhenever I look at this information,\nthis is also grayed out, okay?\n\n390\n00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:34.280\nAnd that's because I cannot make any\nchanges to a secondary zone, right?\n\n391\n00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.563\nThis is only a readable copy,\nso I can't make any changes,\n\n392\n00:24:38.563 --> 00:24:41.057\nI can't create new host records.\n\n393\n00:24:41.057 --> 00:24:44.935\nSo if I right-click here, I don't have\nthat option to go ahead and create new.\n\n394\n00:24:44.935 --> 00:24:48.165\nSo hopefully,\nyou can understand how that works.\n\n395\n00:24:48.165 --> 00:24:50.162\nWe've got our primary and\nwe got our secondary.\n\n396\n00:24:50.162 --> 00:24:54.497\nOur secondary receives that\ninformation from our primary or\n\n397\n00:24:54.497 --> 00:24:56.370\nhowever we configure it.\n\n398\n00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:59.877\nWe had to specify who we\nwanted to get that from,\n\n399\n00:24:59.877 --> 00:25:03.309\nbut that's one way we\ncan use standard zones.\n\n400\n00:25:03.309 --> 00:25:06.986\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, so the idea\nhere of creating the standard zones for\n\n401\n00:25:06.986 --> 00:25:10.958\nwhat we're actually doing does give us\nthat different way of making sure that we\n\n402\n00:25:10.958 --> 00:25:14.841\ncan not have to be worried about whether\nor not we're on a domain controller.\n\n403\n00:25:14.841 --> 00:25:17.040\nOr whether we need to integrate\nin with other things.\n\n404\n00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.098\nBeing able to use the primary and the\nsecondary zones are actually good things\n\n405\n00:25:21.098 --> 00:25:23.795\nfor us to be able to understand and\nsetting up here.\n\n406\n00:25:23.795 --> 00:25:27.959\nAnd seeing all the tabs, it does look like\na fairly complex thing at the beginning,\n\n407\n00:25:27.959 --> 00:25:29.639\nbut don't be intimidated by it.\n\n408\n00:25:29.639 --> 00:25:34.171\nAnd go, make sure you at least understand\nthe concepts of those standard types\n\n409\n00:25:34.171 --> 00:25:34.796\nof zones.\n\n410\n00:25:34.796 --> 00:25:39.710\nNow, Cherokee, what makes the standard\nzone different than, let's say,\n\n411\n00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:40.850\nthat other zone?\n\n412\n00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:45.600\nWhere is this normally gonna be stored,\nthe information that we find here?\n\n413\n00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.050\n&gt;&gt; So the information that you find,\nthe standard zone,\n\n414\n00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:53.040\nlike I said, it's gonna be\nstored on that local machine.\n\n415\n00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.450\nAnd one thing we can do\nis modify it directly.\n\n416\n00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:59.422\nSo it stored within that hard drive and\nit's stored within a DNS file.\n\n417\n00:25:59.422 --> 00:26:00.699\nSo let's see here.\n\n418\n00:26:00.699 --> 00:26:01.918\nI can show you guys actually.\n\n419\n00:26:01.918 --> 00:26:03.800\nThis is the domain member.\n\n420\n00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.956\nLet me get on the other machine,\nand we'll show you.\n\n421\n00:26:10.336 --> 00:26:14.945\nAll right,\nthis is going to be the domain controller.\n\n422\n00:26:14.945 --> 00:26:21.816\nOkay, so if I go ahead and navigate\ndown and pull up my C drive here and\n\n423\n00:26:21.816 --> 00:26:26.416\nthen let's go under Windows, System32.\n\n424\n00:26:30.526 --> 00:26:32.395\nAnd then there's a DNS folder.\n\n425\n00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.690\nOkay, and let me zoom in a little bit so\nyou guys can see this.\n\n426\n00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:42.344\nNow this is that particular zone\nthat we had created, right?\n\n427\n00:26:42.344 --> 00:26:47.411\nSo if I go ahead and right-click and\nselect Open with, I can see,\n\n428\n00:26:47.411 --> 00:26:52.124\nlet's see, you can't open this\ntype of file, one second.\n\n429\n00:26:52.124 --> 00:26:53.203\n&gt;&gt; It's not an Apple, that's PC.\n\n430\n00:26:53.203 --> 00:26:55.525\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\nwe wanna open it with Notepad.\n\n431\n00:26:55.525 --> 00:26:59.091\nAnd sometimes you can use\nanother tool like Notepad++ and\n\n432\n00:26:59.091 --> 00:27:03.166\nit has additional integrated features\nthat are built just for DNS.\n\n433\n00:27:03.166 --> 00:27:05.880\nBut this is just regular\nold Notepad right here.\n\n434\n00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.200\nAnd this is where that information\nis stored, it's just a regular file.\n\n435\n00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.610\nThat is something that we\nshould be concerned with.\n\n436\n00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.630\nBecause just like any other\nkind of file on a system,\n\n437\n00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:21.185\nit can be modified, it can be viewed.\n\n438\n00:27:21.185 --> 00:27:24.625\nSo we do need to consider that when\nwe're thinking about security.\n\n439\n00:27:24.625 --> 00:27:26.225\nYou can see our clients right here.\n\n440\n00:27:26.225 --> 00:27:30.219\nWe have client 01, we have client 02 with\nthose A records, and as a matter of fact,\n\n441\n00:27:30.219 --> 00:27:32.816\nlet's go ahead and\nlet's create another client here.\n\n442\n00:27:32.816 --> 00:27:36.823\nSo let's just say, being super creative,\n\n443\n00:27:36.823 --> 00:27:40.514\nwe'll say client 03 with an A record.\n\n444\n00:27:40.514 --> 00:27:46.517\nAnd the IP address there\nwill be 192.168.0.8 and\n\n445\n00:27:46.517 --> 00:27:50.173\nwe'll go ahead and hit File &gt; Save.\n\n446\n00:27:50.173 --> 00:27:53.675\nWhat's really cool about\nthese standard zones too is I\n\n447\n00:27:53.675 --> 00:27:55.891\nhad mentioned that flexibility.\n\n448\n00:27:55.891 --> 00:28:00.573\nSo the syntax, the layout, the typing\nof this particular Notepad file looks\n\n449\n00:28:00.573 --> 00:28:05.256\nthe same regardless of what other type\nof DNS service, if you're on a Unix and\n\n450\n00:28:05.256 --> 00:28:09.384\nyou're using BIND or something else,\nthe syntax will be the same.\n\n451\n00:28:09.384 --> 00:28:13.180\nSo that's what allows that\nsimplicity there, the flexibility.\n\n452\n00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:17.347\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nclose and back on up here and\n\n453\n00:28:17.347 --> 00:28:20.716\nlet's go back into our\nDNS Management Console.\n\n454\n00:28:20.716 --> 00:28:22.876\nAnd I think I have it up, yeah.\n\n455\n00:28:22.876 --> 00:28:26.824\nAll right, it'll take a second to go\nahead and propagate that information.\n\n456\n00:28:26.824 --> 00:28:32.878\nI may even need just to go in here and\nhit refresh so I can see that client 03.\n\n457\n00:28:32.878 --> 00:28:34.700\nAnd I might have to talk more, but\n\n458\n00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:39.610\nit will eventually propagate more in there\nbecause I had manually modified that file.\n\n459\n00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:42.398\nAnd then it'll go ahead and show up\nright here, but let's try it again.\n\n460\n00:28:46.276 --> 00:28:48.265\nAll right, so\nit's just taking a little bit.\n\n461\n00:28:48.265 --> 00:28:50.869\nBut this is where that information,\nand you can do all sorts of things.\n\n462\n00:28:50.869 --> 00:28:55.771\nYou can even modify that particular\ntext file using the dnsmd command\n\n463\n00:28:55.771 --> 00:28:59.334\nwithout actually going\nthrough a GUI interface.\n\n464\n00:28:59.334 --> 00:29:04.262\nSo if you have DMS stored or\nrunning on a Server Core installation,\n\n465\n00:29:04.262 --> 00:29:07.606\nyou could essentially\nbe performing the same\n\n466\n00:29:07.606 --> 00:29:13.130\nfunction just via commandline\ninterface instead of a GUI as well.\n\n467\n00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:15.794\nAll right, I have to check one\nmore time to see if it's in there.\n\n468\n00:29:15.794 --> 00:29:19.543\nOkay, I still don't see it in there,\nbut you get the point.\n\n469\n00:29:19.543 --> 00:29:24.617\nThat's where he should be, and I just\ndon't have any more patience, Ronnie.\n\n470\n00:29:24.617 --> 00:29:25.825\nI think we're out of time for this show.\n\n471\n00:29:25.825 --> 00:29:28.504\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, there's no doubt\n\n472\n00:29:28.504 --> 00:29:31.874\nwe are up against a hard break for\nus at this particular point in time.\n\n473\n00:29:31.874 --> 00:29:35.080\nBut what we did get to see\nin this episode, of course,\n\n474\n00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.235\nis that idea of creating\na standard type of DNS zone.\n\n475\n00:29:38.235 --> 00:29:42.469\nWhether we're talking about doing\na primary or a secondary, well,\n\n476\n00:29:42.469 --> 00:29:46.557\nthat the idea of zones here is really\na database of those domain name\n\n477\n00:29:46.557 --> 00:29:50.430\nrecords that we actually want\nlinked up to those IP addresses.\n\n478\n00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:54.130\nAnd those are essential things\nwhen it comes to setting up DNS.\n\n479\n00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.921\nNow there's a lot more to go, we haven't\neven covered the other two zones that\n\n480\n00:29:56.921 --> 00:29:59.340\nCherokee mentioned at\nthe beginning of this episode.\n\n481\n00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.360\nSo that brings us back for part two and\n\n482\n00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.730\nmaybe we'll also be able to see the update\nthat happens in that zone as well.\n\n483\n00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.585\n&gt;&gt; I actually just did it now so, yeah.\n\n484\n00:30:07.585 --> 00:30:08.837\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I do wanna show you, though.\n\n485\n00:30:08.837 --> 00:30:11.540\nBecause there's one extra step\nthat you may need to perform here.\n\n486\n00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:16.776\nAnd if you hit reload for that particular\nzone, reload and then refresh.\n\n487\n00:30:16.776 --> 00:30:20.180\nI'm gonna hit No because you can\nsee that my client is right here.\n\n488\n00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.628\nSo I reloaded, and then hit Refresh.\n\n489\n00:30:21.628 --> 00:30:27.410\nAnd there's [LAUGH] client03,\nso, yep, patience, my young one.\n\n490\n00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:29.675\n[LAUGH] But that's it for this show.\n\n491\n00:30:29.675 --> 00:30:32.136\nWe do have more DNS,\nthough, for sure, Ronnie.\n\n492\n00:30:32.136 --> 00:30:35.283\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, great place for\nus to end this episode, then.\n\n493\n00:30:35.283 --> 00:30:38.440\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n494\n00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.336\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee

00:00:08.095\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.095 --> 00:00:10.721\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:15.054\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.054 --> 00:00:20.130\nYou're watching the Windows Server 101\nshow, and I'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.077\nToday we're taking a look at part\ntwo on working with DNS zones.\n\n8\n00:00:24.077 --> 00:00:27.661\nWe already talked about covering some\nprimary zones and some secondary zones,\n\n9\n00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:29.704\nbut there's still a bit more for\nus to cover.\n\n10\n00:00:29.704 --> 00:00:33.262\nAnd here to help us to make sure that we\nunderstand more about this topic is Ms.\n\n11\n00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:34.110\nCherokee Boose.\n\n12\n00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.256\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n13\n00:00:35.256 --> 00:00:36.278\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:36.278 --> 00:00:41.017\nYeah, so we took a look at primary and\nwe also saw our secondary zones, but\n\n15\n00:00:41.017 --> 00:00:45.462\nI wanted to talk about stub zones,\nbeginning in this conversation.\n\n16\n00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:48.948\nAnd it's kind of interesting because\nstub zones are very, very similar to\n\n17\n00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:53.510\nsomething that we've already spoke about,\nand that would be conditional forwarding.\n\n18\n00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.730\nSo, remember, forwarding is just\ngoing to be like an always on,\n\n19\n00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.278\nalways happening type of forwarding.\n\n20\n00:01:00.278 --> 00:01:03.638\nConditional forwarding adds an if,\nthen parameter.\n\n21\n00:01:03.638 --> 00:01:08.398\nSo it says if you're querying for this\nparticular domain, and I think we had used\n\n22\n00:01:08.398 --> 00:01:13.171\nan example for like Contoso domain or\nsomething on a diagram we've seen before.\n\n23\n00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:17.915\nSo it says if you're querying an IP\naddress for a device within the Contoso\n\n24\n00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:22.353\ndomain, then I'm gonna forward you\nto the authoritative server for\n\n25\n00:01:22.353 --> 00:01:26.505\nthat Contoso domain to help speed up and\nexpedite this process.\n\n26\n00:01:26.505 --> 00:01:29.826\nSo I don't have to go through that\niterative process all the way up to my\n\n27\n00:01:29.826 --> 00:01:31.587\nroot hands and then go through that.\n\n28\n00:01:31.587 --> 00:01:36.312\nSo we have efficiency, but there's\na slight problem with our conditional\n\n29\n00:01:36.312 --> 00:01:42.040\nforwarders because I manually input where\nI created that conditional forwarder.\n\n30\n00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.424\nI have manually input the IP address for\n\n31\n00:01:44.424 --> 00:01:48.116\nthat authoritative DNS server\nwithin that Contoso domain.\n\n32\n00:01:48.116 --> 00:01:52.852\nSo what happens if that DNS server goes\ndown or they change their IP address,\n\n33\n00:01:52.852 --> 00:01:56.750\nmaybe that network interface\ncard has to be replaced.\n\n34\n00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.564\nAnd they forget to let me know about it,\nbecause maybe we are just business\n\n35\n00:02:00.564 --> 00:02:03.530\npartners, and\nI'm not too high on their priority list.\n\n36\n00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.710\nWell, now that conditional forwarder\nis not goinna be working properly.\n\n37\n00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.145\nSo stub zones take this concept to,\nI guess, another level.\n\n38\n00:02:12.145 --> 00:02:15.655\nSo it's the same concept but\nthey're retaining, or\n\n39\n00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:19.009\nthey're getting this\ninformation dynamically so\n\n40\n00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.920\nthat if that IP address did\nchange it would know about that.\n\n41\n00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.024\nAnd it would be able to reflect those\nchanges to all the individuals or\n\n42\n00:02:27.024 --> 00:02:29.232\nthe machines that were querying it.\n\n43\n00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:33.330\nAnd it's not any kind of\nsensitive top secret information,\n\n44\n00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.704\nthe information that it is\nobtaining from that DNS\n\n45\n00:02:36.704 --> 00:02:40.605\nserver Is not the full copy\nof everything that is stored.\n\n46\n00:02:40.605 --> 00:02:43.140\nIt's only a handful of records.\n\n47\n00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.865\nSo the type of records that you're gonna\nbe getting with a stub zone are gonna be\n\n48\n00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:47.380\nyour SOA.\n\n49\n00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.085\nRemember your SOA is your start of\nauthority, and that's gonna include your\n\n50\n00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:54.394\nconfiguration information,\nwho to contact if there's a problem.\n\n51\n00:02:54.394 --> 00:02:58.056\nIt's sets the TTLs for\nyour specific records.\n\n52\n00:02:58.056 --> 00:03:00.753\nIt's also gonna contain the NS server.\n\n53\n00:03:00.753 --> 00:03:05.569\nSo those are gonna be your name\nserver records to help specify those\n\n54\n00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.720\nauthoritative servers, and\n\n55\n00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.967\nthen it'll also have the corresponding\nA records for those NS servers,\n\n56\n00:03:12.967 --> 00:03:18.240\nand those are Interesting,\nthey're called glue host records.\n\n57\n00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.366\nSo what that means is that it's\nhelping glue everything together.\n\n58\n00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:26.350\nIt's helping this process work so\nthat we know who to find.\n\n59\n00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.283\nSo we have the correct fully qualified\ndomain name to the IP address for\n\n60\n00:03:30.283 --> 00:03:31.824\nthose name servers there.\n\n61\n00:03:31.824 --> 00:03:35.500\nSo that's really all that's in there,\nyou don't need permission like we saw.\n\n62\n00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.813\nIn that last demo, where we created\nthat secondary server, we had to jump\n\n63\n00:03:39.813 --> 00:03:44.212\nback to that primer or that master to\ngo ahead and authorize that transfer.\n\n64\n00:03:44.212 --> 00:03:47.500\nHere, we don't have that because\nit's all public information.\n\n65\n00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.092\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at a diagram.\n\n66\n00:03:50.092 --> 00:03:52.740\nBrian had a diagram similar\nto this in his book.\n\n67\n00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.151\nI kind of just copied his steps here, but\nlaid them out a little bit differently.\n\n68\n00:03:57.151 --> 00:03:59.426\nSo let me walk through those with you.\n\n69\n00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:02.578\nHere we have the client here.\n\n70\n00:04:02.578 --> 00:04:04.430\nWe have two separate domains,\nfirst of all.\n\n71\n00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.789\nWe have a contoso.com domain and\nthen we alpineskihouse.\n\n72\n00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:12.000\nThat sounds nice,\nsome kind of Colorado vacation.\n\n73\n00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.123\nSo let's say this client\nwants to go ahead and\n\n74\n00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:23.622\nresolve an address within this\nalpineskihouse, alpineskihouse.net domain.\n\n75\n00:04:23.622 --> 00:04:27.965\nSo the first step here is\ngoing to be step number one,\n\n76\n00:04:27.965 --> 00:04:33.495\nwhere the client sends a DNS query\nto the contoso.com DNS server,\n\n77\n00:04:33.495 --> 00:04:38.770\nand asks for the address of\nintranet.alpineskihouse.com.\n\n78\n00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.392\nThere is one thing that I would\nlike to point out, though.\n\n79\n00:04:40.392 --> 00:04:45.154\nRemember, there is one other thing that\nhappens at the very beginning here\n\n80\n00:04:45.154 --> 00:04:50.067\nthat's not noted in those steps, and\nthat's it will check its local cache,\n\n81\n00:04:50.067 --> 00:04:54.546\nthis device, to see if that record\nhas been stored in its local cache.\n\n82\n00:04:54.546 --> 00:04:58.957\nIf it's not stored locally,\nthen it will proceed to go ahead and\n\n83\n00:04:58.957 --> 00:05:02.670\ncheck the cache of that DNS server for\ncontoso.com.\n\n84\n00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.857\nThe next step would be here,\nthe DNS server checks its cache,\n\n85\n00:05:05.857 --> 00:05:09.001\nthat's what's happening now,\nto see if it has that entry.\n\n86\n00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:13.225\nBut if it doesn't have that entry,\nthen it's gonna go ahead and\n\n87\n00:05:13.225 --> 00:05:17.059\nuse the NS records in the stub\nzone to contact one of the name\n\n88\n00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:22.220\nservers that are listed here within\nthe alpineskihouse.net domain.\n\n89\n00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.559\nAnd then that can send a query to\nthat name server to go ahead and\n\n90\n00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.990\nresolve for internet.alpineskihouse.net.\n\n91\n00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.860\nSo step number four it's gonna be checking\ntheir zone there, the primary zone.\n\n92\n00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.073\nSo the DNS server is gonna\nbe checking its cache, and\n\n93\n00:05:38.073 --> 00:05:43.198\nthe configuration there in it finds that\nit hosts the primary zone for that domain.\n\n94\n00:05:43.198 --> 00:05:47.513\nSo it will go ahead and now respond\nback to this server and say hey,\n\n95\n00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:51.270\nI found that information and\ngot that IP address.\n\n96\n00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.013\nAnd then lastly it will go ahead and\nsend that to the original client that was\n\n97\n00:05:56.013 --> 00:06:00.096\nrequesting now that client is\nable to go ahead and communicate.\n\n98\n00:06:00.096 --> 00:06:03.028\nSo all this is happening\nin the background, and\n\n99\n00:06:03.028 --> 00:06:06.047\nwe really didn't have to\nset anything up for it.\n\n100\n00:06:06.047 --> 00:06:08.770\nIt's more intuitive, okay?\n\n101\n00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:15.742\nSo that's kind of what stub zones look\nlike as far as a graphical representation.\n\n102\n00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:19.262\nBut I also want to show you\nhow we can go ahead and\n\n103\n00:06:19.262 --> 00:06:22.888\ncreate one within our\nDNS management console.\n\n104\n00:06:22.888 --> 00:06:25.620\nSo let me go ahead and pull that up here.\n\n105\n00:06:28.684 --> 00:06:33.271\nYou can also, when you're creating\na conditional forwarder or a stub zone,\n\n106\n00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:36.600\nyou can also have it integrated\nwith Active Directory.\n\n107\n00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.404\nThat is an option to do as well.\n\n108\n00:06:38.404 --> 00:06:42.490\nSo we can go ahead and\nright-click, and select New Zone.\n\n109\n00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.384\nAnd this is the same wizard that\nwe have been launching, but\n\n110\n00:06:46.384 --> 00:06:48.960\nwe're just selecting different\noptions here, right?\n\n111\n00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.754\nSo we'll hit Next, and\nhere we can select Stub Zone.\n\n112\n00:06:54.754 --> 00:06:58.894\nAnd you can see the types of records\nthat I mentioned to you, the NS server,\n\n113\n00:06:58.894 --> 00:07:01.458\nthe name server,\nthe start of authority, and\n\n114\n00:07:01.458 --> 00:07:05.110\npossibly glue host A records to\nhelp point to those name servers.\n\n115\n00:07:07.662 --> 00:07:10.241\nYou could uncheck this depending\non you know if you are running\n\n116\n00:07:10.241 --> 00:07:11.650\nActive Directory, or not.\n\n117\n00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.088\nWe could go ahead and leave it, but\n\n118\n00:07:13.088 --> 00:07:15.629\nwe'll just stick with the theme\nhere of our standard zones.\n\n119\n00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:20.473\nAnd this could also work great in\nan environment where I might have a very\n\n120\n00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:21.765\nlarge forest, and\n\n121\n00:07:21.765 --> 00:07:27.600\na lot of domains within my forest,\nso it can help manage those queries.\n\n122\n00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.232\nWe'll hit Next,\ncreate that forward lookup zone, and\n\n123\n00:07:31.232 --> 00:07:33.716\nagain we'll just leave it for IT Pro.\n\n124\n00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:42.411\nWhoops, demo.com.\n\n125\n00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:53.045\nNext, and so here for our IP address we\nwould need to know the IP address and\n\n126\n00:07:53.045 --> 00:07:55.024\nI'm trying to think here.\n\n127\n00:07:55.024 --> 00:07:59.186\nLet's go ahead and,\nIn this lab environment.\n\n128\n00:07:59.186 --> 00:08:04.195\nI might just wanna go ahead and\nI'll just select a random\n\n129\n00:08:04.195 --> 00:08:10.175\nLet's just say .0.100 for\nthis particular, and hit Next.\n\n130\n00:08:10.175 --> 00:08:12.428\nAnd really that's it for\nour stub zones here.\n\n131\n00:08:12.428 --> 00:08:15.970\nSo it's a very simple,\nit's similar to conditional forwarding but\n\n132\n00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.870\nthat dynamic update process is happening.\n\n133\n00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.868\nSo you're not stuck in\na static environment.\n\n134\n00:08:22.868 --> 00:08:28.015\nIf you foresee any kind of changes for\na particular forward option, then I\n\n135\n00:08:28.015 --> 00:08:33.522\nwould go ahead and use a stub zone instead\nof the conditional forwarder there.\n\n136\n00:08:33.522 --> 00:08:36.875\nAll right, what's next on our list here?\n\n137\n00:08:36.875 --> 00:08:38.910\nIt looks like we've covered quite a bit so\nfar.\n\n138\n00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.295\nLet's talk about zone transfers for\na second.\n\n139\n00:08:43.295 --> 00:08:47.123\nSo when we were taking a look\nat our primary server and\n\n140\n00:08:47.123 --> 00:08:51.995\nour secondary server, I said that\nthe secondary server is gonna be\n\n141\n00:08:51.995 --> 00:08:55.740\nreceiving information from\nour primary at times.\n\n142\n00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.270\nWell, how does that happen?\n\n143\n00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.220\nIs there a schedule?\n\n144\n00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.985\nYes, that's something called\nyour replication topology.\n\n145\n00:09:01.985 --> 00:09:07.164\nNow by default, that primary server\n\n146\n00:09:07.164 --> 00:09:12.844\nis going to be sharing information every\n\n147\n00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:18.534\n15 minutes to that secondary server.\n\n148\n00:09:18.534 --> 00:09:20.640\nYou can modify that time, and you can even\nselect a notifications option, which,\n\n149\n00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.934\nin 2016,\nby default that option is selected so\n\n150\n00:09:21.934 --> 00:09:23.943\nthat if a dynamic change has been made,\nit will notify that secondary server.\n\n151\n00:09:23.943 --> 00:09:25.370\nWhy would you wanna do this?\n\n152\n00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.520\nWhy wouldn't you wanna do this?\n\n153\n00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.330\nWell, you would want to do it to have\nthe most accurate DNS information.\n\n154\n00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.590\nBut you may not wanna do it\nto help reserve bandwidth.\n\n155\n00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.190\nBecause if you have a lot of updates,\nand a lot of changes,\n\n156\n00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.900\nthen, it's gonna be calling\nout every single time.\n\n157\n00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:45.530\nYou might wanna just uncheck that and\nkeep it to that standard 15 minutes there.\n\n158\n00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:50.620\nNow that very first time that\nwe created that secondary zone,\n\n159\n00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.060\nand we pulled that entire\nzone from the primary.\n\n160\n00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.710\nSo that was a full transfer.\n\n161\n00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:02.500\nSo you'll hear that being\nreferenced as an AXFI.\n\n162\n00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.446\nAnd if it's an incremental,\nsometimes whenever every 15 minutes,\n\n163\n00:10:06.446 --> 00:10:09.840\nlet's say only 1 particular device\nthat information had changed.\n\n164\n00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.760\nAnd only incremental\ninformation has changed.\n\n165\n00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.160\nI'm not gonna be pulling that\nentire zone down every time,\n\n166\n00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.210\nthat would just waste my bandwidth, right?\n\n167\n00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.220\nSo only those incremental\nchanges will be pushed out,\n\n168\n00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:25.010\nand that's going to be an IXFI for\nthose particular transfers.\n\n169\n00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.666\n&gt;&gt; There probably should\nbe an R at the end.\n\n170\n00:10:26.666 --> 00:10:29.210\n&gt;&gt; XR, yes, for transfer, sorry, guys.\n\n171\n00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.320\nSo that IXFR and AXFR.\n\n172\n00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.950\nSo for your A,\nif you wanna think about all,\n\n173\n00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.290\nI'm not really sure what that stands for.\n\n174\n00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.870\nBut the I, for the IX,\nis going to be incremental.\n\n175\n00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.464\nSo that's just one way to remember it.\n\n176\n00:10:40.464 --> 00:10:44.120\nWhat else here with our zones?\n\n177\n00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.430\nRemember the option there not to go ahead\nand use any server, because we don't wanna\n\n178\n00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.860\nbe just transferring this information\nto any server that's out there.\n\n179\n00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.309\nWe could have a rogue server\non our network there.\n\n180\n00:10:54.309 --> 00:10:59.760\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n181\n00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.320\nSo for our ITPro Demo Co, and\nif we go to properties, for\n\n182\n00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.500\nour zone transfers tab,\nthis is where we looked at that before,\n\n183\n00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.710\nbut this is that option here for\nthe notify.\n\n184\n00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.830\nAnd let me just zoom in, and\n\n185\n00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.710\nyou can see that by default it is\nselected here to Automatically notify.\n\n186\n00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:23.150\nBut that is something that we may or\nmay not wanna go ahead and have.\n\n187\n00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.580\nYou could also specify the servers\nlisted on that name servers tab.\n\n188\n00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.910\nSo there is some granularity here,\nsome options for you.\n\n189\n00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.214\nYou could even say, hey, look,\n\n190\n00:11:31.214 --> 00:11:33.834\nthese are the particular servers\nthat I wanna go ahead and notify.\n\n191\n00:11:33.834 --> 00:11:35.590\nAnd that's what you would input there.\n\n192\n00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:41.634\nNow Active Directory replication is\ngonna be a little bit different.\n\n193\n00:11:41.634 --> 00:11:45.440\nThey already have a scheme set up.\n\n194\n00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.190\nSo when you think about we\nhad already looked at where\n\n195\n00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.440\nthat information is stored\nin a standard zone.\n\n196\n00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.640\nIt was under that system 32\nfolder under that DNS folder.\n\n197\n00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.650\nWe saw that file,\nit was just a regular text file.\n\n198\n00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.430\nBut with\nan Active Directory Integrated Zone,\n\n199\n00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.360\nwe're actually creating a partition\nwithin the Active Directory database.\n\n200\n00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.110\nAnd that information is kind\nof being pushed on into that\n\n201\n00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:13.340\npreexisting active directory database,\nwhich has its own replication scheme.\n\n202\n00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:20.374\nNow Within Active Directory, we have\nwhat's called multi-master replication.\n\n203\n00:12:20.374 --> 00:12:24.402\nSo it's not like times\nof past where we had our\n\n204\n00:12:24.402 --> 00:12:29.470\none domain controller that\nwas only the writable copy.\n\n205\n00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:33.280\nBut we can write to multiple domain\ncontrollers within our environment.\n\n206\n00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:39.290\nSo I can write to multiple DNS servers\nwithin my environment and they can share\n\n207\n00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:45.170\nthat information and update dynamically\nvia the Active Directory replication.\n\n208\n00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.930\nSo where that information is stored,\nit's not just stored in one location.\n\n209\n00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.910\nSo this is going to\nincrease fault tolerance.\n\n210\n00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.760\nI think I actually have a diagram here,\n\n211\n00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.330\nlet's go ahead and take a look at\nthat to show you the difference.\n\n212\n00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.170\nSo before, if you think back to that\nfirst diagram that we looked at,\n\n213\n00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.880\nI had a primary server up here and\n\n214\n00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:10.890\nthen I had two secondary servers\ndown here for the standard zones.\n\n215\n00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.050\nAnd I could only go to my\nprimary to make those changes.\n\n216\n00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:17.170\nBut here, within\nan Active Directory Integrated Zone,\n\n217\n00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:20.250\nI can go to any of these DNS servers.\n\n218\n00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.560\nBut remember,\n\n219\n00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.900\nyou have to have them running that\ndomain controller functionality.\n\n220\n00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.710\nSo these are all domain controllers, and\n\n221\n00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:31.160\nI can go ahead and send changes to all\nthree of these particular servers.\n\n222\n00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:36.100\nAnd then these pink lines here are gonna\nindicate the sharing of those changes.\n\n223\n00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.570\nSo they wanna go ahead and\nkeep all of those servers up to date and\n\n224\n00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.610\nsync them with the same information.\n\n225\n00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:46.380\nAnd I can also query all three\nof these servers to go ahead and\n\n226\n00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.050\nperform that resolution for me.\n\n227\n00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.860\nSo I definitely have load balancing.\n\n228\n00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.240\nI have secure transfers.\n\n229\n00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.940\nSo here I'm using actual encryption when\n\n230\n00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:01.140\nI'm sending this information\nacross the wire.\n\n231\n00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.740\nI don't have that with my\nstandard primary zones.\n\n232\n00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:09.950\nI also have another option to\nimplement within Active Directory\n\n233\n00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.120\nunder my security tab.\n\n234\n00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.770\nI can implement access\ncontrols in that way.\n\n235\n00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:18.560\nSo in my opinion, Active Directory\nis a really great way to go here.\n\n236\n00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.118\nYou've got your fault tolerance.\n\n237\n00:14:20.118 --> 00:14:23.647\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, that's a lot\nof good information about the ideas of\n\n238\n00:14:23.647 --> 00:14:26.349\nchoosing something like\nActive Directory in a.\n\n239\n00:14:26.349 --> 00:14:28.977\nHow do we actually tell the difference\nsince you've already showed us\n\n240\n00:14:28.977 --> 00:14:31.550\nthat we're gonna be able to create\nthe whole thing using the same\n\n241\n00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.250\nwizard that we've been using?\n\n242\n00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.630\nHow does it show up differently?\n\n243\n00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it is the same wizard,\nthere's not too much different there.\n\n244\n00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.310\nBut if we take a look at my\nscreen I would like to show you.\n\n245\n00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.460\nSo you might come into an environment and\nyou're not really sure,\n\n246\n00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.050\nyou're not creating a zone,\nit's already pre-existing.\n\n247\n00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:51.146\nSo if you just simply right-click on\ntop of that zone and go to Properties,\n\n248\n00:14:51.146 --> 00:14:53.169\nit'll tell you if it's a standard.\n\n249\n00:14:53.169 --> 00:14:55.050\nIt'll say if it's primary or secondary.\n\n250\n00:14:55.050 --> 00:15:02.341\nAnd here you can see, right here it says\nthe type is Active Directory-Integrated.\n\n251\n00:15:02.341 --> 00:15:03.497\nAnd you know what?\n\n252\n00:15:03.497 --> 00:15:04.385\nSince we're already here,\n\n253\n00:15:04.385 --> 00:15:06.800\nlet's take a look at a couple of those\nthings that we were just talking about.\n\n254\n00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.407\nAnd it's very,\nvery easy to go ahead and change.\n\n255\n00:15:12.407 --> 00:15:17.156\nSo if I wanted to just have a standard\nprimary zone, or maybe I had standard and\n\n256\n00:15:17.156 --> 00:15:21.907\nI wanted an Active Directory-Integrated,\nthis kind of pulls back that same\n\n257\n00:15:21.907 --> 00:15:25.390\npage that we had seen right\nfrom within the wizard.\n\n258\n00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.480\nAnd you're able to go ahead and\nsee here, yeah,\n\n259\n00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.460\nthis is the Primary that's\nintegrated with Active Directory.\n\n260\n00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.931\nBut I could easily deselect that and\nthen hit OK.\n\n261\n00:15:34.931 --> 00:15:36.993\nPretty easy to go ahead and change.\n\n262\n00:15:36.993 --> 00:15:38.680\nI'm gonna hit Cancel for right now.\n\n263\n00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.861\nA couple other points of topic would be,\nlike we mentioned,\n\n264\n00:15:43.861 --> 00:15:46.940\nour Secure-only dynamic updates.\n\n265\n00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:52.035\nSo only machines that are gonna be\nspecified either via that Name Servers\n\n266\n00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:56.965\ntab or directly specified under that\ncategory would be considered for\n\n267\n00:15:56.965 --> 00:15:58.651\nthose secure updates.\n\n268\n00:15:58.651 --> 00:16:02.290\nRemember, we don't wanna\nselect Nonsecure and secure,\n\n269\n00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:07.348\nbecause essentially you're saying\nNonsecure means, well, anyone, right?\n\n270\n00:16:07.348 --> 00:16:10.434\nSo you can opt for none or secure only.\n\n271\n00:16:10.434 --> 00:16:13.213\nRemember secure only,\nbecause this says we're\n\n272\n00:16:13.213 --> 00:16:17.590\nat an Active Directory integrated zone,\nI have this option, right?\n\n273\n00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.310\nBut, here let's just break\nthings real quick and\n\n274\n00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.680\nsay we don't want to have\nActive Directory integrated.\n\n275\n00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.950\nI'll hit OK.\n\n276\n00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.300\nAnd it kind of gives me a heads up here,\n\n277\n00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.710\nare you sure you don't want to\nbe Active Directory integrated?\n\n278\n00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:35.680\nI'm going to hit yes and then now\nthis option, I only have two options.\n\n279\n00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.160\nI don't even have that secure only option.\n\n280\n00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.070\nI've only got none, non-secure and secure.\n\n281\n00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:44.630\nSo you can see how that affects,\ndrastically,\n\n282\n00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:47.030\nmy security possibilities there.\n\n283\n00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:50.350\nAnd let me go ahead and\nchange that back real quick.\n\n284\n00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:51.500\nYou'll see how easy it is.\n\n285\n00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:57.010\nWe'll go ahead and add that back as\nActive Directory integrated because,\n\n286\n00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.600\nI also want to mention with an Active\nDirectory integrated zone I did say that\n\n287\n00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.125\nyou can utilize those permissions here.\n\n288\n00:17:04.125 --> 00:17:07.184\nAnd integrate that you can even\ncreate if you wanted to take it,\n\n289\n00:17:07.184 --> 00:17:09.334\nwe're not gonna cover\nit here in this show.\n\n290\n00:17:09.334 --> 00:17:13.321\nBut if you wanted to take it a step\nfurther you can create DNS policies and\n\n291\n00:17:13.321 --> 00:17:16.325\nreally marry that within\nActive Directory further.\n\n292\n00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:19.860\nAnd what else do we have here?\n\n293\n00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:23.748\nAnd this is also I think we looked at\ndynamic updates on the general sort of\n\n294\n00:17:23.748 --> 00:17:24.467\nauthority.\n\n295\n00:17:24.467 --> 00:17:27.586\n&gt;&gt; We have that replication\nentry there too.\n\n296\n00:17:27.586 --> 00:17:32.264\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so for our zone transfers this\nis just specifying that scope of who you\n\n297\n00:17:32.264 --> 00:17:34.760\nwould wanna go ahead and replicate to.\n\n298\n00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.668\nAnd we've looked at this also.\n\n299\n00:17:36.668 --> 00:17:40.158\nCurrently, this machine doesn't have the\ntick mark checked, so it's saying it's not\n\n300\n00:17:40.158 --> 00:17:43.290\nallowing these zone transfers,\nbut you would have to check that.\n\n301\n00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:47.890\nThen remember, we do want to\nleave out of this to any server.\n\n302\n00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:52.810\nWe really want to specify either using\nthis server on that main servers tab,\n\n303\n00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:56.610\ninputting them manually an then\nalso remember your SOA,\n\n304\n00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.400\nyour start of authority.\n\n305\n00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.620\nAnd like I said, by default that\ninterval is going to be 15 minutes.\n\n306\n00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:07.360\nYou can go ahead and\nmodify information there.\n\n307\n00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:12.150\nYou have your TTLs, which are going to\ngo ahead and set that time to live for\n\n308\n00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.730\nthe records that are created\nwithin that zone.\n\n309\n00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.940\nSo there's a lot within the interface, and\n\n310\n00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:21.680\nI would, implore you to just go ahead and\nplay around a little bit.\n\n311\n00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.410\nBut I think for this particular level,\nwe'll go ahead and stop here.\n\n312\n00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:30.170\nThere is a lot more to cover with DNS,\nI feel like we've covered so much already.\n\n313\n00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.400\nI think you guys may agree with me on\nthat one but I think that's it for\n\n314\n00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.740\nthis one, Ronnie.\n\n315\n00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.198\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee.\n\n316\n00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:39.626\nThank you again for helping us to take\na look at working with these zone files,\n\n317\n00:18:39.626 --> 00:18:40.482\na little bit more.\n\n318\n00:18:40.482 --> 00:18:45.496\nZones, I should say, not zone files, where\nwe, just briefly, went over the idea of\n\n319\n00:18:45.496 --> 00:18:50.860\nusing, of course, stub zones, and even\nthe Active Directory integrated zones.\n\n320\n00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.680\nMore than likely, as a service\nadministrator especially in the Windows\n\n321\n00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.900\ndomain, you're gonna see the Active\nDirectory integrated zone probably\n\n322\n00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:01.670\nused more often than pretty much all\nthe other ones that are out there.\n\n323\n00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:06.100\nSo don't find that to be something that's\nuncommon, because it's just one of those\n\n324\n00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.440\nthings that just really does\nhelp Active Directory work.\n\n325\n00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.420\nAnd it also works along with replication,\nthe same way that\n\n326\n00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:14.700\nActive Directory will replicate to\neverything throughout the network.\n\n327\n00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.210\nThey'll use that same particular.\n\n328\n00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.670\n&gt;&gt; You don't have multiple replication\ntopologies, it just simplifies that.\n\n329\n00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:20.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n330\n00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.800\nSo the simplification along with\nthat is actually part of the deal\n\n331\n00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.450\non why you tend to see it a little\nbit more often as well, and\n\n332\n00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.440\nof course that secure updating\nis also a good thing too.\n\n333\n00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.930\nSo along with that,\n\n334\n00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:35.250\nremember we're just kind of diving into\nthe realm of what we're actually gonna see\n\n335\n00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.860\nin future episodes if you're\nfollowing along with the book.\n\n336\n00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.550\nYou'll see as we go along\ninto Active Directory,\n\n337\n00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.130\nwe'll take a brief look in there.\n\n338\n00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.940\nBut if you want to learn more about DNS,\nmake sure you check out\n\n339\n00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:50.740\nour entire library as you head\non towards the MCSA, MCSE shows.\n\n340\n00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.690\nYou're gonna see much more\non Active Directory and\n\n341\n00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:56.050\nhow to configure every little\npart of it there as well.\n\n342\n00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.050\nSo, don't take it for granted.\n\n343\n00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.000\nWe've just really scratched the surface.\n\n344\n00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000\nBut that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n345\n00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.210\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n346\n00:20:06.210 -->

00:00:05.254\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n4\n00:00:05.254 --> 00:00:08.071\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:11.272\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.272 --> 00:00:14.917\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.917 --> 00:00:17.070\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.230\nAnd today you are watching\nthe Windows Server 101 show.\n\n9\n00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.738\nWe're about to dive into troubleshooting\nnetwork connections at the server level.\n\n10\n00:00:23.738 --> 00:00:26.910\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be Ms.\nCherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.080\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.460\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.530\nYeah, so networking, this is a big\ntopic and it's kind of funny,\n\n14\n00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.200\nif you look at the term networking\nit's one letter away from not working.\n\n15\n00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.890\nAnd it's kind of ironic because there\nreally are a ton of things that\n\n16\n00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.830\ncould be wrong.\n\n17\n00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.330\nSo let's go ahead In this show and take a\nlook at what some of those issues could be\n\n18\n00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.208\nand then how you could really define that\nscope of the problem and narrow that down.\n\n19\n00:00:49.208 --> 00:00:53.960\nSo I don't know if you guys\nhave been working in IT, but\n\n20\n00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.870\nyou get sort of strange requests\nat times from the help desk.\n\n21\n00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.940\nSometimes people, if they're not\nfamiliar with information technology,\n\n22\n00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.200\nthey may even say something like,\nhey, the Internet's broken.\n\n23\n00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.340\nAnd that's what you have to go by.\n\n24\n00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.160\nSo at those times, you really\nwanna hone in on your skills, and\n\n25\n00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.620\na lot of it comes with experience.\n\n26\n00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.390\nBut there are certain things that you can\ndo, different approaches that you can take\n\n27\n00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.250\nthat'll help guide you in determining\nwhere this problem may lie.\n\n28\n00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.980\nSo for instance, and a lot of it's\nknowing your environment, too.\n\n29\n00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.740\nSo let's say Ronnie calls me every week\nsaying that the Internet's broken but\n\n30\n00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.380\nthen we come to find out that he's\ntrying to log into his system here, but\n\n31\n00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.780\nhe forgets his password and\nhe's not able to authenticate.\n\n32\n00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.990\nSo that's completely different.\n\n33\n00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.770\nAnd you really just have to assess\nthe situation in that manner.\n\n34\n00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.950\nSo you might wanna go ahead and\n\n35\n00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.920\ntry to utilize a particular tool\nthat's been around for a very,\n\n36\n00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.000\nvery long time, since 1983, as a matter\nof fact, and that's the ping utility.\n\n37\n00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.852\nAnd originally that was used just with\na command line interface in a Windows\n\n38\n00:01:54.852 --> 00:01:59.330\nenvironment, but it can be used\nacross multiple platforms as well.\n\n39\n00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.950\nIt was developed by Mike Muuss,\nand if I said his name right.\n\n40\n00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.055\nI'm sorry if I didn't.\n\n41\n00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:09.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it's a very universal tool.\n\n42\n00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.810\nIt's very helpful to assist you in\ndetermining where that problem may lie.\n\n43\n00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.350\nSo for instance, if Ronnie called me and\nsaid that he wasn't\n\n44\n00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.240\nable to log in, if I was at his work\nstation, I could try to go ahead and\n\n45\n00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.630\nping that domain controller to test for\nconnectivity and different approaches.\n\n46\n00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.430\nSo let's go ahead and, let's see here,\nI have a link from Microsoft,\n\n47\n00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.640\nif I'll go ahead and pull that up.\n\n48\n00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.030\nThey give an approach.\n\n49\n00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.340\nBrian Switerval, also from this book,\n\n50\n00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.060\nthis course that we're going with here,\nhe also has an approach listed as well.\n\n51\n00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.965\nThey're very similar.\n\n52\n00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:51.450\nBrian does note to try to ping\nthe DNS server first, but\n\n53\n00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.490\nthere are a couple different tools.\n\n54\n00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.840\nWe'll talk about utilities within the show\nthat we can use and sometimes if you check\n\n55\n00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.350\nipconfig, it'll actually perform\nthat resolution process.\n\n56\n00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.402\nSo it's not completely necessary.\n\n57\n00:03:04.402 --> 00:03:07.361\nIn my opinion, I like to kind\nof go with the OSI model, and\n\n58\n00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:09.410\nthink about it from that perspective.\n\n59\n00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.360\nNow that's not like every single time I'm\nnot gonna directly follow that model.\n\n60\n00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.082\nYou do have to use some intuition there.\n\n61\n00:03:15.082 --> 00:03:17.900\nAnd so if you assume where the problem is,\n\n62\n00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.070\nthen you can bypass a certain or\njust like go in a different order.\n\n63\n00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.560\nLet's take a look here and\nsee what Microsoft has to say.\n\n64\n00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.636\nSo their step, what they have listed here\nfor number one as to who you should ping.\n\n65\n00:03:30.636 --> 00:03:31.750\nAnd let me just clarify.\n\n66\n00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.690\nSo ping is going to be\nsending an ICMP packet and\n\n67\n00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.610\necho request out to a particular node.\n\n68\n00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.440\nSo from a node to a node, and you're\nexpecting to receive that echo back.\n\n69\n00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.910\nSo a normal ping will go ahead and\nsend out four packets.\n\n70\n00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.732\nThe ping packets are gonna be smaller in\nsize, or they're kind of small in size.\n\n71\n00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:56.320\nI think they're about 54 bytes,\nexcluding the IP header information.\n\n72\n00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.420\nAnd we'll take a look at what you can do\nto increase that size if you wanted to\n\n73\n00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.270\nas well.\n\n74\n00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.500\nBut we normally send out\nfour ping packets, and\n\n75\n00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.633\nthen you should expect\nto receive four back.\n\n76\n00:04:04.633 --> 00:04:09.174\nBut a lot of information\ncan be determined from\n\n77\n00:04:09.174 --> 00:04:14.070\nthe results of that echo request,\nso that reply.\n\n78\n00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.796\n[COUGH] The first option that Microsoft\nrecommends is to go ahead and\n\n79\n00:04:17.796 --> 00:04:19.770\nping the loopback address.\n\n80\n00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:25.520\nSo if you recall, if you've taken any kind\nof CompTIA exams, you should know or even\n\n81\n00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.390\njust working in the field our loopback\naddress is 127.0.0.1, that range there.\n\n82\n00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.550\nSo what you're doing essentially when\nyou're pinging that loopback address\n\n83\n00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.060\nis you're testing your hardware.\n\n84\n00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.300\nYou're testing your\nnetwork interface card.\n\n85\n00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.450\nSo if you compare that to the OSI model,\nright, and\n\n86\n00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.970\nwe think about layer one we're\ntalking about our physical layer.\n\n87\n00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.150\nAnd you're talking about your hardware.\n\n88\n00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.140\nYour hardware will reside\nwithin that physical layer.\n\n89\n00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.260\nAnd swapping out that network\ninterface card that's easy.\n\n90\n00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.160\nA hardware goes bad, we know that.\n\n91\n00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.990\nIt does have a life expectancy.\n\n92\n00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.120\nSo kind of grabbing that lower\nhanging fruit first is my methodology,\n\n93\n00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.410\nunless, like I said, unless I know I have\na suspicion that it may be an application,\n\n94\n00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.630\nI might start at application layer or\nsomething like that.\n\n95\n00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.560\nA particular application keeps hanging, or\nwhatever, whatever that situation may be.\n\n96\n00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.601\nSo they say to go ahead and\ncheck for that hardware, all right.\n\n97\n00:05:17.601 --> 00:05:21.985\n[COUGH] If the loopback step fails and\nthe IP stack is not responding,\n\n98\n00:05:21.985 --> 00:05:25.070\nthen that should be an indication\nto go ahead and check the hardware.\n\n99\n00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.220\nSo the next thing you want to do is\ngo ahead and you can ping someone,\n\n100\n00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.590\nI usually like to try to ping\nsomeone within my local address.\n\n101\n00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.904\nAnd again, think about the OSI model here.\n\n102\n00:05:35.904 --> 00:05:38.400\nWe're staying within\nsomeone on your switch.\n\n103\n00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.544\nThink about layer two.\n\n104\n00:05:39.544 --> 00:05:41.720\nSo I have a diagram here.\n\n105\n00:05:43.592 --> 00:05:45.550\nSomewhere, let me zoom out.\n\n106\n00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.470\nSo here I have a switch, and\n\n107\n00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.290\nI have different nodes connected\nto that particular switch.\n\n108\n00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.830\nI have a wireless access point,\nwhich my laptops are connecting as well.\n\n109\n00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.404\nSo you kind of wanna approach\nit in the sense like, okay,\n\n110\n00:05:59.404 --> 00:06:02.244\nlet's say computer A, 10.0.1.1.\n\n111\n00:06:02.244 --> 00:06:05.993\nSomeone calls you from that\nparticular work station, says hey,\n\n112\n00:06:05.993 --> 00:06:07.500\nthe Internet's broken.\n\n113\n00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.630\nMaybe they're trying to get out to\na website out here on the Internet, right?\n\n114\n00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.250\nSo you might wanna go\nthrough that first step.\n\n115\n00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.140\nPing that loopback adapter, see if\ntheir network interface card is bad.\n\n116\n00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.170\nSo they're able to go ahead and\nping themselves, all right, let's move on.\n\n117\n00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.106\nSo let's go ahead and try to ping someone\nelse like node D over here, 10.0.1.4.\n\n118\n00:06:23.106 --> 00:06:28.235\nSo depending on the result of that\nparticular ping, if you're not able to\n\n119\n00:06:28.235 --> 00:06:33.300\nping that person, then you're gonna\nneed to try to examine the switch.\n\n120\n00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.290\nMaybe there's an issue\nwith that particular port.\n\n121\n00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.250\nTry a couple other people\nwithin that switch.\n\n122\n00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.290\nAnd see if you get a couple\ndifferent calls from\n\n123\n00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.910\nthe person sitting at node A and\nthe person sitting at node C.\n\n124\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.060\nAnd then you get a ticket for node D,\nor even one of those wireless devices.\n\n125\n00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.510\nThat should be an indication\nto you that hey,\n\n126\n00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.560\nmaybe I should go investigate\nthis particular switch.\n\n127\n00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.470\nSo you can try to find\ncorrelations depending on\n\n128\n00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.000\nhow your network is configured\nusing the ping utility.\n\n129\n00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.240\nFor instance, if no one within\nyour environment can get out,\n\n130\n00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.610\nmaybe let's go ahead and\ntry to ping that default gateway.\n\n131\n00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.920\nAnd maybe that router's down.\n\n132\n00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.110\nMaybe it needs to be reset.\n\n133\n00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.020\nMaybe you just had a hardware failure.\n\n134\n00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.550\nSo you wouldn't be able to\nreach out to the Internet.\n\n135\n00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.910\nMaybe there's a problem on the actual\nserver out on the Internet.\n\n136\n00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.180\nIt does happen.\n\n137\n00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.480\nMaybe it's a problem within one\nof the routes, one of the routers\n\n138\n00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.660\nconnecting you from your default gateway\nto the final destination on the Internet.\n\n139\n00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.284\nSo there are a lot of different tools that\nwe can use to really help, like they said,\n\n140\n00:07:32.284 --> 00:07:35.474\ndefine that scope and\nisolate where that problem may be.\n\n141\n00:07:35.474 --> 00:07:36.790\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee.\n\n142\n00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.960\nWhen we start taking a look at using ping,\nthough,\n\n143\n00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.177\nthe whole goal behind it is to\nreally verify connectivity, right?\n\n144\n00:07:44.177 --> 00:07:47.320\nThat my machine is gonna be\nconnected to the network and\n\n145\n00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.169\nat that point the use of your ping allows\nus to see whether we're connecting inside,\n\n146\n00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:55.818\neven out to the edge of our network and\neven beyond that as well.\n\n147\n00:07:55.818 --> 00:07:56.586\nSo Cherokee,\n\n148\n00:07:56.586 --> 00:08:00.830\nwhat are some of the different response\nthat I may get in terms of ping?\n\n149\n00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.120\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\nsometimes you may get errors back.\n\n150\n00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.220\nAnd sometimes you may get\nmessages that seem like errors.\n\n151\n00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.110\nBut aren't always going to be that case.\n\n152\n00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:12.470\nSo sometimes you'll see a message that\nsays, destination host unreachable.\n\n153\n00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.430\nAnd what that means is that local machine\n\n154\n00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.190\nwas not able to communicate\nto your final destination.\n\n155\n00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.920\nSo that packet was never actually\ndelivered or placed onto the wire.\n\n156\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.250\nSometimes if it says destination\nhost unreachable, and\n\n157\n00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.080\nif it's a reply from\na particular IP address,\n\n158\n00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.410\nthen that IP address which is\ngoing to be a hop along the way.\n\n159\n00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:37.180\nAnd I use this term hop and\nI hope you understand it.\n\n160\n00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.210\nIf not then remember a hop\nis just going to be one stop\n\n161\n00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.110\nalong that path whenever you're\ntalking about your route, right, so\n\n162\n00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:49.730\nif a particular router is not able to find\nthe correct path to that final destination\n\n163\n00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:54.430\nthen that router is going to reply with\nthat destination host unreachable.\n\n164\n00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.770\nSo there may be something\nwrong with that router.\n\n165\n00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.148\nThat's, it just means you weren't able\nto get from point A to point B there.\n\n166\n00:09:01.148 --> 00:09:04.520\nNow another error message\nthat you may receive here,\n\n167\n00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.910\nthis is going to be\nyour request timed out.\n\n168\n00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.960\nSo if you think about our packets.\n\n169\n00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.050\nWe have TTLs within our hops.\n\n170\n00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:17.400\nAnd remember, your TTL when we're talking\nabout network transmission here is going\n\n171\n00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.190\nto be how many hops can you transverse\nbefore you reach your final destination.\n\n172\n00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:27.190\nSo, we do that, send a TTL so\nthat if there is a routing problem we just\n\n173\n00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.790\ndon't have packets circulating\nthroughout the network for infinity.\n\n174\n00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:35.060\nSo depending on a lot of different things.\n\n175\n00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:39.970\nThat doesn't mean that the particular\ndevice is down functioning out of order.\n\n176\n00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:43.430\nIt just means again, hey, we weren't\nable to get to that final destination.\n\n177\n00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.960\nSome common reasons could\nbe network congestion,\n\n178\n00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.980\nit could be even a firewall setting.\n\n179\n00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.130\nAnd if you think about it,\nI said that ping,\n\n180\n00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.200\nthe underlying protocol that the ping\npackets are utilizing is gonna be ICMP,\n\n181\n00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.160\nall right,\ninternet controlled message protocol.\n\n182\n00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.715\nSome firewalls will go ahead and\nblock ICMP messages as a security,\n\n183\n00:10:04.715 --> 00:10:07.645\nfor security reasons,\nas well as performance reasons.\n\n184\n00:10:07.645 --> 00:10:10.505\nBecause their routers may\nbe just performing routing.\n\n185\n00:10:10.505 --> 00:10:14.775\nAnd they don't want to have them being\nbothered responding to these ICMPV's echo\n\n186\n00:10:14.775 --> 00:10:16.220\nrequests, right.\n\n187\n00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.690\nSo it could be turned off in nature,\n\n188\n00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:24.920\nor if it's actual problem, then you\nwould probably be seeing that other\n\n189\n00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.930\nerror message there,\nthe destination host unreachable.\n\n190\n00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.570\nSo those are some responses.\n\n191\n00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.760\nThere are a couple others.\n\n192\n00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.010\nYou might get some additional\ndetailed information.\n\n193\n00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:37.850\nBut I think that's a really good start\nto go ahead and know that for now.\n\n194\n00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:42.210\nBut let's take a look at my machine and\nsee what we're talking about here, right?\n\n195\n00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:46.190\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and use PowerShell.\n\n196\n00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.970\nI don't think there's anything that\nI wanna show you today that I'm\n\n197\n00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.950\nnot gonna be able to do within PowerShell.\n\n198\n00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.170\nSo in the past.\n\n199\n00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.260\nWe would use command prompts a lot.\n\n200\n00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.510\nBut now you can use these same\ncommands within PowerShell.\n\n201\n00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.090\nAnd I also wanna show you\nsome PowerShell commands so\n\n202\n00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.590\nit'll just be easier if\nwe work from within here.\n\n203\n00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:08.360\nAnd you'll probably find that as a habit\nwhen you're working in the field as well.\n\n204\n00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:13.190\nSo if you just go ahead and type in ping\nand you don't even have to do the forward\n\n205\n00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.570\nslash question mark but\nyou can if you want to.\n\n206\n00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.030\nBut if you just hit Enter.\n\n207\n00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.875\nYou're gonna get different\noptions available to you,\n\n208\n00:11:19.875 --> 00:11:21.337\nthese are called switches.\n\n209\n00:11:21.337 --> 00:11:26.237\nThere are parameters that you can\nspecify to really tailor that\n\n210\n00:11:26.237 --> 00:11:32.220\nping to do something different,\nfor instance, here like a -t.\n\n211\n00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.470\nThe syntax would be ping-t and\nthen the IP address for\n\n212\n00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.110\nthe fully qualified domain name.\n\n213\n00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.850\nYou can even put the -t at\nthe end of the IP address for\n\n214\n00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.000\nfully qualified domain name.\n\n215\n00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.662\nAnd I'll show you here in a moment,\nas we go through some of these, but\n\n216\n00:11:45.662 --> 00:11:48.420\na -t, so I said originally,\n\n217\n00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.650\nwe're going to be sending four of\nthose ping packets to perform a test.\n\n218\n00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:57.520\nAnd when I do a -t,\nI'm not limited to those four.\n\n219\n00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.710\nI'm actually running a continuous ping\nwhich is really great if you're working\n\n220\n00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.740\nremotely and you've restarted a machine or\na router, some kind of device.\n\n221\n00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.460\nAnd you wanna ping it to see\nwhen that machine comes back up.\n\n222\n00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:16.850\nAlso, you could use the -t parameter\nif you had an intermittent issue.\n\n223\n00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:17.970\nSo for instance,\n\n224\n00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.390\nI can think of this one time where\nthere's this strange issue happening.\n\n225\n00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:26.470\nAnd we were having connectivity problems,\nbut it was only at certain times.\n\n226\n00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.920\nSo like I said,\nstart with your lower hang fruit first.\n\n227\n00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.820\nSo we run this -t perimeter, and I'm just\nsitting here watching it, right, and\n\n228\n00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.320\nthen I noticed there's a correlation,\nwhenever the cubicle starts bouncing\n\n229\n00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.220\naround like if someone nudged it, that's\nwhen you actually lose connectivity.\n\n230\n00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.660\nAnd what it was, was a pinched cable\nwithin that particular cubicle.\n\n231\n00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.000\nSo using a continuous ping\nlike that can really help.\n\n232\n00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.280\nI'm just saying that's a very basic\nexample of that but it works, right?\n\n233\n00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.220\nSo why make a situation worse than\nwhat it really needs to be when it's\n\n234\n00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.150\nsomething that simple?\n\n235\n00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.320\nWe have a lot of different\nparameters here.\n\n236\n00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:06.010\nI'll show you a few of those, but a -a,\nis gonna resolve addresses to host names.\n\n237\n00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.550\nSo we just came off talking about DNS.\n\n238\n00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.750\nThere's a whole slew of problems\nthat can transpire with DNS.\n\n239\n00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:15.459\nYou do have specific DNS utilities\nthat we did speak about but\n\n240\n00:13:15.459 --> 00:13:18.452\nin the most basic\nrudimentary resolution here.\n\n241\n00:13:18.452 --> 00:13:22.994\nYou can do a -a to help take those host\nnames, you take the IP address and\n\n242\n00:13:22.994 --> 00:13:26.190\nresolve it to a host name\nwithin the ping utility.\n\n243\n00:13:27.835 --> 00:13:30.470\n-n to specify the count size.\n\n244\n00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:34.030\nNow here with the -l to\nspecify the buffer size.\n\n245\n00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:38.970\nSo you put the -l parameter but then\nyou also need to add a numerical value\n\n246\n00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.030\nto indicate the size of the bytes for\n\n247\n00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:45.230\nthat particular packet,\nremember 1500 bytes for a typical packet.\n\n248\n00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:49.490\nWe're not talking about jumbo frames or\nanything here, so where this could be\n\n249\n00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:54.660\nuseful is remember how I said the size of\nthat original ping packet is rather small.\n\n250\n00:13:54.660 --> 00:14:00.680\nSo let's try to emulate or\nrecreate a real life problem.\n\n251\n00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.260\nSo maybe my ping packets\nare working just fine\n\n252\n00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.100\ncommunicating with the particular router.\n\n253\n00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.190\nBut I keep getting calls\nfrom the help desk saying\n\n254\n00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.390\nthat they're having connectivity problems,\nright.\n\n255\n00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:15.390\nSo if I wanted to make that ping packet\nresemble the legitimate traffic that's\n\n256\n00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:20.760\nflowing through your network, then I\ncan increase the byte size to make it\n\n257\n00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.420\nLike a larger packet to see if that\nrouter is having issues processing it.\n\n258\n00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.840\nDifferent parameters here\nto specify your TTLs,\n\n259\n00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.560\na -f is going to go ahead and\nindicate that you don't want a fragment.\n\n260\n00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.660\nIn certain situations you need to\nhave that information contiguous and\n\n261\n00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.890\nmaybe you're having issues.\n\n262\n00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:43.150\nSome routers aren't even going\nto accept fragmented packets so.\n\n263\n00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.410\nThere might be issues, reasons why you\nwould want to go ahead and specify that.\n\n264\n00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.396\nAnd you can see there are a lot more here,\nbut\n\n265\n00:14:48.396 --> 00:14:50.717\nthose are probably gonna\nbe your most common ones.\n\n266\n00:14:50.717 --> 00:14:51.860\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nSo Cherokee,\n\n267\n00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.120\ngreat explanation on some of the different\noptions that we have with ping there.\n\n268\n00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.720\nCan we now actually see\nthose commands in action?\n\n269\n00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me switch over\nto my local machine here.\n\n270\n00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.500\nAnd let's go ahead and\nperform some of these examples.\n\n271\n00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.720\nSo for instance,\nif we just do a regular ping.\n\n272\n00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:12.770\nAnd let's say I'm trying to ping\nwww.itpro.tv, go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n273\n00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.080\nAnd you'll notice those four packets here.\n\n274\n00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.300\nI've got my reply,\nit'll indicate the IP address.\n\n275\n00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:25.740\nAgain here you see the TTL and\nthe time in milliseconds that it takes for\n\n276\n00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:29.750\nit to go ahead and\nreturn those echo requests.\n\n277\n00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:34.930\nSo if you're running, if you notice\nany kind of anomalies here and\n\n278\n00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:40.520\nbig differences within this time or higher\nlatency then that may cause for further\n\n279\n00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.830\ninvestigation for us to use another tool\nlike traceroute or something like that.\n\n280\n00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:47.290\nAnd we'll talk about that and\nhow it correlates as well.\n\n281\n00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.759\nYou do have to keep in mind though if\nyou're trying to ping internationally or\n\n282\n00:15:52.759 --> 00:15:55.990\nif you're depending on your different\ntypes of connections, right.\n\n283\n00:15:55.990 --> 00:16:00.563\nSo if you're utilizing connection via\nsatellite then you need to account for\n\n284\n00:16:00.563 --> 00:16:01.416\nthat as well.\n\n285\n00:16:01.416 --> 00:16:04.711\nAgain, that kind of just goes\nwith knowing your environment and\n\n286\n00:16:04.711 --> 00:16:07.456\nhaving a good baseline, and\nbeing familiar with it so\n\n287\n00:16:07.456 --> 00:16:11.850\nthat you can identify if anything is\nstrange or out of the usual there.\n\n288\n00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:14.800\nOkay, so\nthose are my regular four packets.\n\n289\n00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.590\nBut like I said, let's say there was an\nintermittent problem, or I wanted to get\n\n290\n00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:23.940\na larger sample window for that particular\ntest, that ping that I was performing.\n\n291\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.520\nSo I can just go ahead and do ping -t.\n\n292\n00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:32.108\nAnd then I could even put, since now\nI know the IP address of ITProTv,\n\n293\n00:16:32.108 --> 00:16:37.688\nI can go ahead and put 192.124.249.106.\n\n294\n00:16:37.688 --> 00:16:39.630\nAnd go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n295\n00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:44.730\nNow, because this is a continuous\nalive command that I have executed,\n\n296\n00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:48.190\nit's going to keep going and going until\nI either close out of the window or\n\n297\n00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:52.900\nI go ahead and press a combination of\nkeys, which is going to be the control key\n\n298\n00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.690\nand the C key to go ahead and stop and\nend that particular ping there.\n\n299\n00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:58.750\nAnd you can see.\n\n300\n00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.290\nI mean, it looks like I've got\na pretty consistent connection here,\n\n301\n00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:02.750\nall 27 milliseconds, and\n\n302\n00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.570\nthat's really what you're trying\nto find some information from.\n\n303\n00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.190\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee, we also want to make sure\nthat we understand something here with\n\n304\n00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.030\nthis continuous ping\nthing that can happen.\n\n305\n00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:16.770\nThis is really good and effective\nthat allows us to do a lot of things,\n\n306\n00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:21.700\nespecially not only test the connectivity\nand the latency of the connectivity, but\n\n307\n00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.110\nyou do have to be careful\non certain machines,\n\n308\n00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.260\nespecially if you're pinging\nout to the Internet.\n\n309\n00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.300\nSometimes what will end up happening for\nyour organization is you go,\n\n310\n00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.780\nI just want to test this connectivity for\na while, and you do that continuous ping.\n\n311\n00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.660\nIt can block you.\n\n312\n00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:38.040\nThe organization can actually block\nyour pings, that after a while,\n\n313\n00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.280\nit will end up failing.\n\n314\n00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.680\nAnd this is something that you don't\nwant to have to end up happening.\n\n315\n00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.940\nSo, just be very careful, that you might\nknow like the day before you issued out\n\n316\n00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.330\nthis continuous ping,\nand it worked just fine.\n\n317\n00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.870\nThe following day,\nyou might issue it out, and\n\n318\n00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.120\nit might not actually come back at all.\n\n319\n00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.440\nAnd which might actually frighten you,\n\n320\n00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.750\nexcept that when you go to the webpage,\nit actually works, and everything is fine.\n\n321\n00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:00.465\nAnd so that could be on the other end.\n\n322\n00:18:00.465 --> 00:18:02.020\nIt's just saying, look, I've gotten so\n\n323\n00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:07.840\nmany pings from Ronnie that we're not\nactually going to allow that to happen.\n\n324\n00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.040\nAnd you'll end up finding problems with\nthis, not necessarily on the server end,\n\n325\n00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.470\nunless it's trying to send\nwhat we call a keep alive and\n\n326\n00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.460\nit's using a ping per second.\n\n327\n00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.070\nSometimes if you do stuff like that,\nit will after a while,\n\n328\n00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:23.480\nespecially if we just choose a random IP\naddress out there on the Internet to do\n\n329\n00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:27.660\nthis with that's not ready to respond\nto pings all the time and doesn't care.\n\n330\n00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.750\nIt can lock you down and it can cause\nissues on whatever device that you're on.\n\n331\n00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.420\nBut just be aware of that,\ncuz I have seen that happen.\n\n332\n00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.440\nAnd I'll tell you the truth,\n\n333\n00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.004\nI've actually made that happen by not\nrealizing that I was one digit off and\n\n334\n00:18:40.004 --> 00:18:43.260\nthat hit somebody else's IP address\nrather than one that I did.\n\n335\n00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.020\nAnd it responded for a while, but\nafter a while it really did shut it off,\n\n336\n00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.360\nand I was like I shouldn't have done that.\n\n337\n00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.380\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ronnie was denied.\n\n338\n00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.197\n&gt;&gt; I was denied.\n\n339\n00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:54.824\nSo just kinda like, yeah,\nping can be a good tool.\n\n340\n00:18:54.824 --> 00:18:59.250\nBut at the same time, remember that also\nhackers can take advantage of it, too.\n\n341\n00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:00.120\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n342\n00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:05.010\nAnd you even may hear that ping of\ndeath where they're sending, they're\n\n343\n00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.420\nmodifying this size of that packet to\ntry to perform like a denial of service.\n\n344\n00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.920\nBut I wanna say it was like 1997, most\ndevices since then are able to compensate\n\n345\n00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.599\nfor that, and\nthey're not really effective.\n\n346\n00:19:14.599 --> 00:19:16.080\nBut if you're dealing\nwith older equipment,\n\n347\n00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.290\nthen that may still be an issue.\n\n348\n00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.810\nBut just be aware of that also.\n\n349\n00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:23.340\nSo, if we can go back into my screen here,\nand\n\n350\n00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:27.440\nalso there are some statistical\ninformation that is displayed as well.\n\n351\n00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.580\nSo it'll go ahead and tell you the number\nof packets sent or received, and\n\n352\n00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.490\nthen I'll give you\na percentage of loss as well.\n\n353\n00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.240\nSo it has some good information there.\n\n354\n00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:41.040\nNow, talking about that\nrudimentary name resolution.\n\n355\n00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.610\nLet's go ahead and test that as well.\n\n356\n00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.920\nAnd so, Ronnie and\nI were talking about this before the show.\n\n357\n00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.630\nAnd back in the day,\nwhen you were to go ahead and\n\n358\n00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:52.800\nperform name resolution it would normally\ndisplay the name of that company or\n\n359\n00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.220\nthat individual organization or\nindividual person.\n\n360\n00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:01.217\nBut let's go ahead and type in,\nlet's see, this is going to be ping,\n\n361\n00:20:01.217 --> 00:20:03.017\nthis is going to be a -a.\n\n362\n00:20:03.017 --> 00:20:07.342\nAnd you can go ahead, and we can try,\nlet's try ITPro, right here.\n\n363\n00:20:07.342 --> 00:20:13.582\nSo 192.124.249.106.\n\n364\n00:20:16.291 --> 00:20:18.365\nAnd you can see that it has been returned.\n\n365\n00:20:18.365 --> 00:20:23.227\nIt says Cloudproxy 10106.securi.net.\n\n366\n00:20:23.227 --> 00:20:26.020\nNow, this is going to be\na provider that we're using.\n\n367\n00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.410\nAnd organizations,\nmore and more these days,\n\n368\n00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:32.910\nare gonna be using third-party\nentities to host services.\n\n369\n00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:37.250\nWe talk about software is a service and\nhardware as a service,\n\n370\n00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.780\nso we'll see that more and more happening.\n\n371\n00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.365\nBut it does give you some basic\ninformation there as well.\n\n372\n00:20:42.365 --> 00:20:46.720\n&gt;&gt; And with this name resolution process\nthat you're seeing right here, right?\n\n373\n00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.370\nIt shows you that our website\nitself is behind a secured server,\n\n374\n00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:51.890\nis what it's behind.\n\n375\n00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:55.540\nSo, this is kind of an Internet based\nfirewall, is what you're seeing.\n\n376\n00:20:55.540 --> 00:21:00.080\nSo that way, we are protecting everything\nthat comes into our network as well.\n\n377\n00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.340\nSo, don't be surprised if you end up\nseeing response like this instead of\n\n378\n00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.720\nthe exact name\n\n379\n00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.115\nresolution directly back to the\norganization that you think it's going to.\n\n380\n00:21:09.115 --> 00:21:11.900\nYou're actually seeing the server that\nyou are hitting at this point, and\n\n381\n00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.429\nthat's whats going on.\n\n382\n00:21:13.429 --> 00:21:18.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and let's go ahead and do a test\nhere to increase that packet size.\n\n383\n00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:24.487\nSo, let's go ahead and type in ping, -l,\nand then space and then we'll put in 1000.\n\n384\n00:21:24.487 --> 00:21:26.033\nSo here we're gonna have 1,000 bytes.\n\n385\n00:21:26.033 --> 00:21:34.353\nAnd again, we'll just use 192.124.249.106.\n\n386\n00:21:36.679 --> 00:21:40.389\nAnd what we're doing is simulating\na larger packet test here,\n\n387\n00:21:40.389 --> 00:21:42.390\nso that's what's happening.\n\n388\n00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:46.070\nAnd again, we can see our 0% loss,\nso that's what I'm looking for,\n\n389\n00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.880\neverything seems good.\n\n390\n00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:52.690\nAnd, again, I can use the ping tool\nto help us find where that problem\n\n391\n00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.710\nmay why and who I can communicate with and\nwho can I not.\n\n392\n00:21:55.710 --> 00:22:00.360\nAnd that will help you logically\ndetermine your next step there.\n\n393\n00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.090\nNow, because were working here in\nPowerShell, let me just go ahead and\n\n394\n00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:04.520\nclear out my screen.\n\n395\n00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.660\nI do want to show you a test.\n\n396\n00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.710\nActually, I have a page here I can,\nTech Net is great for\n\n397\n00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:17.840\ngiving us information about\nour particular commands there.\n\n398\n00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.340\nSo here,\nwe can see different types of syntax for\n\n399\n00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.990\nthis test-connection commandlet.\n\n400\n00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:28.410\nSo, scrolling down,\nthey have some basic syntax.\n\n401\n00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:29.620\nAnd what I'll show you.\n\n402\n00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.180\nBut what's really cool about\nthis is it's like Ping, but\n\n403\n00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:38.080\nyou can really add additional parameters\nand really control it in that way.\n\n404\n00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.140\nSo for instance,\nwhenever I run a regular ping,\n\n405\n00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:45.080\nI'm testing from whatever device\nI'm running that ping command from.\n\n406\n00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.210\nSo here, on my laptop, you just saw it,\nit was my Cherokee machine.\n\n407\n00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:51.660\nI was testing from this actual laptop.\n\n408\n00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:57.210\nIf I wanted to test from\na different source, I could either\n\n409\n00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:02.740\nsome kind of remote desktop procedure or\nI could go ahead and use 3389.\n\n410\n00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.980\nI would have to go into that machine.\n\n411\n00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.200\nWhatever your method may be, but\n\n412\n00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.590\nyou would have to initiate that\ncommunication from whatever device.\n\n413\n00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.120\nThat would be your source.\n\n414\n00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.257\nWith this PowerShell commandlet I can\nspecify an alternative source and\n\n415\n00:23:16.257 --> 00:23:18.310\ntest from different machines.\n\n416\n00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.210\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n417\n00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:25.030\nYou also have this quiet parameter\nthat you can use, and it'll\n\n418\n00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:28.850\njust respond with the boolean result,\nso it will either be true or false.\n\n419\n00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.460\nSo basically did I connect or not?\n\n420\n00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:34.103\nSo, if you're not worried about all\nthe details that ping will give us,\n\n421\n00:23:34.103 --> 00:23:35.300\nand you just wanna know,\nhey, can I connect or\n\n422\n00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.990\nnot real quick, then using that\nparameter will go ahead and tell you.\n\n423\n00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:42.180\nSo let's go ahead and\ntry that here within PowerShell.\n\n424\n00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.130\nSo the first one that I wanna go ahead and\n\n425\n00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:48.329\ntry is we're gonna type\nin Test.Connection.\n\n426\n00:23:48.329 --> 00:23:50.440\n&gt;&gt; Dash connection.\n\n427\n00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.258\n&gt;&gt; If I can spell it, -Connection, yes.\n\n428\n00:23:52.258 --> 00:23:55.240\n[LAUGH] If I can spell it or\ntalk, that would be great today.\n\n429\n00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.285\nAll right, and then here, I'm gonna\ngo ahead and type in computer name.\n\n430\n00:24:03.927 --> 00:24:06.731\nComputerName, and\nin my lab environment, and\n\n431\n00:24:06.731 --> 00:24:09.546\nyou guys have access to\nthese labs here as well.\n\n432\n00:24:09.546 --> 00:24:13.602\nAnd it's a domain environment, so\nI'm using my host name to go ahead and\n\n433\n00:24:13.602 --> 00:24:15.341\ntest this connectivity here.\n\n434\n00:24:15.341 --> 00:24:18.289\nSo I'm on the domain controller PLAD DC01,\nso\n\n435\n00:24:18.289 --> 00:24:21.470\nI'm going to,\nI'm still on my local machine here.\n\n436\n00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:25.970\nLet me switch back over, if I can pay\nattention, that would really help.\n\n437\n00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.670\nOkay, here, I can see that I'm\nnow in my lab environment,\n\n438\n00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:30.200\nI'm not on my local machine there.\n\n439\n00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.695\nSo let's go ahead and redo that.\n\n440\n00:24:31.695 --> 00:24:36.842\nSo Test-Connection -ComputerName,\n\n441\n00:24:36.842 --> 00:24:43.660\nand this is going to be PLAB,\nour domain number 01.\n\n442\n00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.350\nAll right, so\nwe're just gonna go ahead and run that.\n\n443\n00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:51.670\nAnd this is a pretty basic output,\nokay, the format, the layout here.\n\n444\n00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.970\nUsually, you'll see these\ncolumns here within PowerShell.\n\n445\n00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:55.350\nI can see the source.\n\n446\n00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:57.811\nSo this is, like I said,\nthis is where I wanna be right now,\n\n447\n00:24:57.811 --> 00:24:58.913\nthat domain controller.\n\n448\n00:24:58.913 --> 00:25:03.750\nAnd I'm using this domain controller\nto go ahead and ping my domain member.\n\n449\n00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.920\nI can see the IP address\nof my domain member.\n\n450\n00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.370\nAnd I do have additional parameters\nI can go ahead and add here.\n\n451\n00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:14.215\nSo what's the next test we\nwanna go ahead and perform?\n\n452\n00:25:14.215 --> 00:25:16.690\nLet's specify a different source, okay?\n\n453\n00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.090\nSo I'll just hit my up arrow here.\n\n454\n00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:24.204\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ntry to still continue\n\n455\n00:25:24.204 --> 00:25:28.903\nto ping PLABDM01, but if I go ahead and\n\n456\n00:25:28.903 --> 00:25:33.619\nadd source, let's say, PLABDM02.\n\n457\n00:25:33.619 --> 00:25:37.940\nSo go ahead and hit Enter, and\nyou can see now how there's a difference.\n\n458\n00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:43.370\nMy source is PLABDM02,\ndestination still hasn't changed,\n\n459\n00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:50.348\nso that IP address hasn't changed, but\nI'm able to go ahead and test that way.\n\n460\n00:25:50.348 --> 00:25:52.277\nYou can also, this is kind of cool too,\n\n461\n00:25:52.277 --> 00:25:55.040\nyou can test multiple machines\nat one particular time.\n\n462\n00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:00.409\nSo if I go ahead and just let me backtrack\n\n463\n00:26:00.409 --> 00:26:05.616\na little bit here, we've got 01 and\n\n464\n00:26:05.616 --> 00:26:11.656\nthen we'll also PLABDM02 and hit Enter.\n\n465\n00:26:11.656 --> 00:26:15.831\nAnd you can see that I'm testing from my\ndomain controller connectivity to both of\n\n466\n00:26:15.831 --> 00:26:16.747\nthese machines.\n\n467\n00:26:16.747 --> 00:26:20.478\nGive it a second here.\n\n468\n00:26:20.478 --> 00:26:23.477\nI'm gonna just check my syntax,\nonly see one response so far.\n\n469\n00:26:27.773 --> 00:26:30.655\n01, let's try that again.\n\n470\n00:26:30.655 --> 00:26:33.560\nComputerName, checking my syntax,\nyeah, that's good.\n\n471\n00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:38.570\nIt's just taking a little minute here,\nthere it goes, I'm being impatient.\n\n472\n00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.460\nAll right, so you can see that\nresponse from both of those machines.\n\n473\n00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.028\nWhich can be really helpful if you're\ntrying to ping a lot at one time without\n\n474\n00:26:46.028 --> 00:26:47.663\nactually having to script it out.\n\n475\n00:26:47.663 --> 00:26:51.490\nBecause remember how Ronnie showed us\nwe could go ahead and create aliases?\n\n476\n00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:54.815\nSo if we wanted to create an alias for\na group of servers and\n\n477\n00:26:54.815 --> 00:26:58.853\nthen typed that all in, we could\npipe that into a particular script.\n\n478\n00:26:58.853 --> 00:27:02.570\nBut we don't even need to do that here\nwithin PowerShell, so that's pretty cool.\n\n479\n00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:07.570\nAnd the last one that I wanted to show\nyou here is using that quiet parameter.\n\n480\n00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:09.610\nSo let me just kind of backtrack here.\n\n481\n00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:13.652\nWe're still gonna use the Test-Connection,\nbut\n\n482\n00:27:13.652 --> 00:27:17.200\nI am gonna add the Quiet and hit Enter.\n\n483\n00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.710\nAnd you'll see that Boolean result.\n\n484\n00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:21.020\nIt'll either just be a true or\na false here, and\n\n485\n00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.948\ntrue means yes,\nI was able to actually connect.\n\n486\n00:27:23.948 --> 00:27:30.210\nSo, your Test-Connection commandlet is\ngoing to be PowerShell is like ping,\n\n487\n00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:34.230\nbut with additional options, so\nit's kind of like ping on steroids.\n\n488\n00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:38.450\nAnd I think there's one other little\ntidbit I wanted to share with you guys,\n\n489\n00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:40.410\nbecause a lot of people,\nI don't know if I mentioned this or not.\n\n490\n00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:45.640\nBut sometimes you'll hear the term packet\nInternet groper associated with ping,\n\n491\n00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:50.470\nbut that's actually what's called\na backronym, and it's kind of made up.\n\n492\n00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:53.524\nIt's not necessarily has a true origin.\n\n493\n00:27:53.524 --> 00:27:56.769\nWhen that particular utility\nwas originally created,\n\n494\n00:27:56.769 --> 00:27:59.537\nit was created with sonar\nterminology in mind.\n\n495\n00:27:59.537 --> 00:28:02.846\nAnd that’s what they’re really\nreferencing, is sending that ping out and\n\n496\n00:28:02.846 --> 00:28:04.230\nexpecting it to come back.\n\n497\n00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.797\nSo I can’t believe we spent\nan entire episode just on ping.\n\n498\n00:28:07.797 --> 00:28:09.565\nI never thought that that would happen,\n\n499\n00:28:09.565 --> 00:28:11.550\nRonnie, but\nit looks like we are out of time.\n\n500\n00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:15.530\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, well, thank you\nagain for helping us to learn a little bit\n\n501\n00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:19.330\nmore about ping and some of those\nadditional options, as well as introducing\n\n502\n00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:22.560\nus to the Test-Network\nconnection side of PowerShell.\n\n503\n00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.314\nBoth of these are utilities that\nwe need to be familiar with,\n\n504\n00:28:25.314 --> 00:28:27.528\nas we continue to work more and\nmore with Server.\n\n505\n00:28:27.528 --> 00:28:31.866\nWe're gonna see the PowerShell command\nis gonna give us more options than what\n\n506\n00:28:31.866 --> 00:28:33.321\nthe regular ping will do.\n\n507\n00:28:33.321 --> 00:28:36.580\nSo make sure you take a look at that\na little bit more in depth as well.\n\n508\n00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.330\nBut Cherokee is right, there is actually\nmore to come than just ping and\n\n509\n00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:43.490\nnetwork connections, or\ntesting the actual connection here.\n\n510\n00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:45.700\nSo that means we will be\nheading into a part 2,\n\n511\n00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:49.050\nbut that means that this is a great\nplace also for us to sign off.\n\n512\n00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:51.370\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nRonnie Wong.\n\n513\n00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:52.390\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n514\n00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:56.616\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Windows

00:00:06.836\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:08.339\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.067\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:15.880\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,\nto your Microsoft Server 101 series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.970\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.065\nIn this episode, we're gonna be taking a\nlook at some basic administration when we\n\n9\n00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:23.594\ntalk about Active Directory.\n\n10\n00:00:23.594 --> 00:00:26.362\nAnd with us today in studios we have Mr.\nRonnie Long.\n\n11\n00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:27.930\nThank you for joining us today Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.680\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\nhaving me in the studios.\n\n13\n00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.750\nAs we get started on one of the most\nimportant topics when it comes down to\n\n14\n00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.690\nunderstanding and\nworking with servers, right?\n\n15\n00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.250\nInside a Windows server, one of the things\nthat were really going to be dealing with\n\n16\n00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.300\nis the idea of course of Active Directory\ndomains, and even forest, and\n\n17\n00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.250\nof course all the management\nskills that we have to have there.\n\n18\n00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.831\nThe incredible depth of this topic,\nCherokee,\n\n19\n00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:58.950\nis insane because-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It really is.\n\n20\n00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.233\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what we're covering in this\nlittle series in just a few episodes We\n\n21\n00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:06.895\nliterally have complete shows\non each one of those topics, and\n\n22\n00:01:06.895 --> 00:01:09.790\na lot of it dealing with Active Directory.\n\n23\n00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.090\nSo we're not gonna do justice,\nlet's put it that way.\n\n24\n00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.050\nWe're going to essentially introduce\neverybody to the concept of it.\n\n25\n00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.030\nAnd understand some of the most basic,\ncommon administrative tasks that we have\n\n26\n00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.300\nto get familiar with as we\nstart working with servers.\n\n27\n00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.350\nSo let's start off that way and at least\nunderstand what we're talking about\n\n28\n00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.780\nwhen we start talking about the idea\nof an Active Directory domain or\n\n29\n00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.220\nstructure is what we're taking in.\n\n30\n00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.810\nSo let's take a look at my machine.\n\n31\n00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.850\nI've created a simple diagram,\n\n32\n00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.800\nI hope that helps us to understand\nwhat we're normally seeing.\n\n33\n00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.730\nWhen we start talking about\nthe idea of a domain, and a domain.\n\n34\n00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.270\nWe're normally seeing something like as\nyou take a look an email address, right?\n\n35\n00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.520\nLike ronnie@itprotv.\n\n36\n00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.492\nThe domain name inside of that is\nto the right of the at symbol.\n\n37\n00:01:55.492 --> 00:02:00.339\nOkay, itpro.tv, so just like what I\nhave right here in the very center of\n\n38\n00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:03.324\nwhat you end up seeing, that's Itpro.tv.\n\n39\n00:02:03.324 --> 00:02:05.107\nNow when we start seeing\nsomething like that,\n\n40\n00:02:05.107 --> 00:02:06.990\nthat means theres a namespace\nthat is involved.\n\n41\n00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.798\nSo DNS of course is involved in that to,\nbut\n\n42\n00:02:09.798 --> 00:02:14.634\nwhen it comes out to all the objects\nthat we create inside this structure,\n\n43\n00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:18.410\nthe database that we say that\nalso belongs to itpro.tv.\n\n44\n00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.230\nThey can be administratively\nmanaged there.\n\n45\n00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.860\nWe're talking about user accounts,\nof course.\n\n46\n00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.610\nWe're talking about, of course,\ncomputers that are there, servers.\n\n47\n00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.200\nYou name it, anything that we want.\n\n48\n00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.470\nWe can set policies.\n\n49\n00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.360\nWe can do everything that we want to.\n\n50\n00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.454\nAnd that is an administrative\naspect of active directory.\n\n51\n00:02:36.454 --> 00:02:39.672\nSo whenever you refer to a domain, okay?\n\n52\n00:02:39.672 --> 00:02:43.615\nA domain is considered\nan administrative boundary for\n\n53\n00:02:43.615 --> 00:02:47.826\nActive Directory is what\nthe term domain is focused in on.\n\n54\n00:02:47.826 --> 00:02:50.680\nSo it's showing us the scope\nof what we can do.\n\n55\n00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.320\nSo normally when you hear the idea of\na domain admin, it means that he is\n\n56\n00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:02.110\nadministratively responsible for all\nthe objects inside this particular domain.\n\n57\n00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.573\nNow if you're just beginning to work with\nsevers, or even in the Microsoft realm.\n\n58\n00:03:06.573 --> 00:03:09.508\nThis structures is gonna be something that\nyou're gonna see over and over again,\n\n59\n00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:10.451\nespecially in diagrams.\n\n60\n00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:14.678\nAnd if you move into the MCSA and the MSCE\ncourses, that were going on there,\n\n61\n00:03:14.678 --> 00:03:18.670\nthese are gonna be very common and\neverything that you end up studying.\n\n62\n00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.905\nSo the triangle here, normally is the\nsymbol that we use for a domain structure.\n\n63\n00:03:23.905 --> 00:03:26.930\nNow a domain can stand by itself, and\n\n64\n00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.260\nit can also represent something else\ntoo which is what we call a forest.\n\n65\n00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.110\nNow notice the way that I\nhave this contrasted here.\n\n66\n00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.330\nA domain is an administrative boundary,\n\n67\n00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.790\na forest though is what was considered\na security boundary for Active Directory.\n\n68\n00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.240\nNow if you are looking at us like,\n\n69\n00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.050\nman where the heck do we\nget this diagram from?\n\n70\n00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.430\nWell inside of Brian´s book,\nyou actually see that this is one diagram.\n\n71\n00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.920\nI just reproduced it, added a little bit\ncolor to it, but that´s what we have.\n\n72\n00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.850\nNow when we start having something like\nthis, let's say at the very beginning,\n\n73\n00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.650\nyou may end up also realizing that\nyou need more than one domain, okay?\n\n74\n00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.390\nSo when you do so, and\nyou split it off such as what I have here\n\n75\n00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.900\nin the lower left and\nlower right hand corner.\n\n76\n00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:18.390\nNotice I have lab.itpro.tv and\nof course dev.itpro.tv as well.\n\n77\n00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.970\nNotice that they share a common\ndomain name space, but\n\n78\n00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.160\nit's really this part here at\nthe beginning that is different.\n\n79\n00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.740\nWhen you see a structure like that,\nthose are what we call child domains.\n\n80\n00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.120\nSo this would be kind\nof a parent domain and\n\n81\n00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.580\nthese would be considered child domains,\nand\n\n82\n00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.670\nthat means that there is a relationship\nthat we have to one another here.\n\n83\n00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.600\nAnd we're not getting that deep into it.\n\n84\n00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.350\nBut just kind of realize that\nthat's what ends up happening\n\n85\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.110\nwhen you start seeing that structure.\n\n86\n00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.990\nIt is built upon this.\n\n87\n00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.920\nAnd of course you see that shared\nnamespace, and that's why we have\n\n88\n00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.610\nsome of the administrative\nresponsibilities that we have here too,\n\n89\n00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.170\nand some of the security\nboundaries as well.\n\n90\n00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.230\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, there is a lot that\nwe can do with Active Directory.\n\n91\n00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.600\nYou mentioned studying for\nthose higher level certifications and\n\n92\n00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.670\nexams, because if you think about it,\nthe more domains that you have,\n\n93\n00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.090\nthere's gonna be more management, there's\ngonna be more configuration required.\n\n94\n00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.470\nAnd that's when you start looking\ninto different types of trusts.\n\n95\n00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.630\nAnd you look at the federated services.\n\n96\n00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.111\nBut where we're gonna start for\nthis particular series?\n\n97\n00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:23.265\n&gt;&gt; Well what we want to do here, right, is\njust to make sure that everybody that now\n\n98\n00:05:23.265 --> 00:05:26.936\nis beginning to encounter the Windows\nserver side of things, right?\n\n99\n00:05:26.936 --> 00:05:33.024\nWhether it's Server 12, 2012 or\nwhether we're talking about Server 2016,\n\n100\n00:05:33.024 --> 00:05:37.568\nwe wanna make sure that we present and\nthat we bring to you the common\n\n101\n00:05:37.568 --> 00:05:42.359\nadministrative basic test that every\nIT professional is working with\n\n102\n00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:47.419\nWindow server is gonna need to at least\nbe able to do or understand, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:52.230\nSo we're gonna start that way as what\nwe are going to do is take a look that.\n\n104\n00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.490\nSo inside of my lab environment,\nI have a domain controller, and the domain\n\n105\n00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:04.110\ncontroller is usually the server that's\ngonna host that Active Directory database.\n\n106\n00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.005\nSo when we talk about the centralized\nserver that host everything,\n\n107\n00:06:07.005 --> 00:06:10.810\nthat we're gonna be managing is\ngonna be that particular server.\n\n108\n00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.110\nSo that server inside of a domain\nenvironment where we have\n\n109\n00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.500\nmultiple servers.\n\n110\n00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.310\nTons of computers operating printers,\nusers and\n\n111\n00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.610\neverything else which I'm\nadministratively responsible for,\n\n112\n00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.480\nthere is at least one server and\nnormally that is true.\n\n113\n00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.510\nIt's gonna be at least one and\nnot just one.\n\n114\n00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.470\nSo usually at least one\nserver in there is gonna have\n\n115\n00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.020\nthat database in which we're gonna\nbe responsible for maintaining, for\n\n116\n00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.450\nmanaging, for\ndoing everything that we need to do.\n\n117\n00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.700\nAnd that is gonna be key, because it\nmeans we also need to go ahead and\n\n118\n00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.390\nstart managing that server.\n\n119\n00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.070\nSo let me go ahead and\nshow you something here.\n\n120\n00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.130\nI'm gonna move over to this\ndomain controller that I have.\n\n121\n00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.740\nLet me make sure I scroll on over,\nthere we go, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.000\nSo let's take a look at my machine here.\n\n123\n00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.532\nAs we start to see it,\nit doesn't look anything different,\n\n124\n00:06:57.532 --> 00:06:59.229\nbut I know I am on the domain controller.\n\n125\n00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:04.283\nAnd if I begin to log in, let's say that\nyou have domain credentials, Cherokee.\n\n126\n00:07:04.283 --> 00:07:07.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And here it is, OFFICEPRODEMOCO, and\n\n127\n00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.390\nI've got it logged in\nas the Administrator.\n\n128\n00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.430\nBut not everybody can just log in.\n\n129\n00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:17.310\nI probably shouldn't have done the switch\nuser here, but let me select other user.\n\n130\n00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.990\nSo I know that there's another\nuser inside of this network here.\n\n131\n00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.516\nSo for example, I know that I'm actually\na user inside this network as well.\n\n132\n00:07:26.516 --> 00:07:31.857\nSo if I type in officeprodemoco\nbackslash Ronnie, and\n\n133\n00:07:31.857 --> 00:07:38.601\nI'm try to remember if I actually\nsays super secret password or not.\n\n134\n00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:41.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it says it's incorrect here.\n\n135\n00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.450\nSo it's not actually letting me log in.\n\n136\n00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.420\nAnd that kind of lets you know something.\n\n137\n00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.240\nNow in this sense whether it's because\nI typed in the wrong password or not.\n\n138\n00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.028\nI myself, even though I'm\nactually part of the domain,\n\n139\n00:07:55.028 --> 00:07:59.037\nI cannot log directly on\nto domain controller.\n\n140\n00:07:59.037 --> 00:08:01.956\nUsually it's very limited, right,\nCherokee, in terms of the domain\n\n141\n00:08:01.956 --> 00:08:05.710\ncontroller, who normally can log\nin just to the domain controller?\n\n142\n00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:06.970\n&gt;&gt; The domain admins.\n\n143\n00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\npretty much it's the domain admins and\n\n144\n00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:14.510\nof course the actual administrator\nitself of that local computer.\n\n145\n00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.300\nBut not very many people get to\nlog in to the domain controller.\n\n146\n00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.005\nSo if I'm set up and I'm supposed to\nmanage this thing, well, how do I do this,\n\n147\n00:08:23.005 --> 00:08:25.911\nCherokee, if I can't get\naccess to this thing?\n\n148\n00:08:25.911 --> 00:08:28.312\nAnd that's kind of a key thing for us,\n\n149\n00:08:28.312 --> 00:08:32.894\nbecause normally we really don't\nwant anybody logging directly in, or\n\n150\n00:08:32.894 --> 00:08:36.812\nvery few people as possible,\nlogging in that machine, why?\n\n151\n00:08:36.812 --> 00:08:41.390\nBecause remember, a server is designed\nthat once we configure it, leave it alone,\n\n152\n00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.370\nlet it do its job.\n\n153\n00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.713\nSo what we want to be able to do\nat the very beginning in terms\n\n154\n00:08:45.713 --> 00:08:50.106\nof administrative task is to set up\nwhat we call remote management instead.\n\n155\n00:08:50.106 --> 00:08:53.280\nI wanna show a couple of different\nvarieties of doing this when\n\n156\n00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.110\nwe start setting this up.\n\n157\n00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.730\nNow I'm gonna use another server\nsince I can't actually get in there,\n\n158\n00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.990\nshow you some of the environment that we\nhave to be able to do to get this set up.\n\n159\n00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.827\nSo on this machine I'm just going\nto log in locally here, and\n\n160\n00:09:06.827 --> 00:09:09.250\nthis is just another server.\n\n161\n00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.633\nAnd I wanna bring up the server manager\nand show you some of the things that have\n\n162\n00:09:12.633 --> 00:09:15.341\nto be configured and\nnormally probably will be configured for\n\n163\n00:09:15.341 --> 00:09:18.223\nyou, if you're actually gonna\nbe doing the remote management.\n\n164\n00:09:20.411 --> 00:09:24.400\nSo I'm gonna bring up the Server Manager,\nand within the Server Manager,\n\n165\n00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.250\nwe're looking at configuring\nsomething on the local server.\n\n166\n00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:33.313\nSo over on the left-hand side,\nI'm going to select Local Server.\n\n167\n00:09:33.313 --> 00:09:36.877\nNow if you're watching and you're like,\nman, Ronnie you're moving fast,\n\n168\n00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:37.800\nI know I am.\n\n169\n00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.369\nBut just notice it is gonna be something\nthat you're gonna have to be able to do.\n\n170\n00:09:41.369 --> 00:09:43.490\nSo I'm going to select Local Server.\n\n171\n00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.549\nAnd what I'm looking for\nis underneath this Properties window,\n\n172\n00:09:47.549 --> 00:09:52.720\nis I wanna zoom in, and I'm looking for\nthis link right here, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.510\nNotice it says Remote management Enabled.\n\n174\n00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:01.366\nI wanna make sure that that is actually\non if I'm gonna do remote management.\n\n175\n00:10:01.366 --> 00:10:04.737\n&gt;&gt; Now, so Ronnie,\nwith Server 2012 and beyond,\n\n176\n00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:09.300\nthe newer versions,\nby default remote management is enabled.\n\n177\n00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.920\n&gt;&gt; Right, so normally we don't have to\nworry about it, but if you're ever not\n\n178\n00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.270\nsure, this is where you can verify that\nthis is something that needs to be on and\n\n179\n00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:21.000\nthat we need to actually make\nsure that is ready and going.\n\n180\n00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.570\nSo if you're not sure about that,\nmake sure it's actually set to Enabled.\n\n181\n00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.663\nNow once you do that, okay,\nbecause everything is set by default and\n\n182\n00:10:28.663 --> 00:10:33.600\nit's on already, we don't really\nhave to do a lot more besides that.\n\n183\n00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.900\nBut the great thing is, I'm not actually\non the domain controller itself.\n\n184\n00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.840\nAnd because Cherokee has now verified for\n\n185\n00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.210\nme, that more than likely on\nmy domain controller, and\n\n186\n00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:46.720\nI know this is true as well,\nis that remote management is turned on.\n\n187\n00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.100\nIt means I should be able\nto be on this computer and\n\n188\n00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:54.600\nalso do remote management to\nthat domain controller as well.\n\n189\n00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.720\nSo I can do that.\n\n190\n00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.670\nNow if I set that up, the easiest way for\n\n191\n00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:03.680\nme to do that is actually using even\nthe PowerShell commands to help us out.\n\n192\n00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.322\nSo if I run the PowerShell\nicon from right here,\n\n193\n00:11:12.923 --> 00:11:16.845\nAnd for remote management, I wanna go\nahead and make sure I do an enable\n\n194\n00:11:18.967 --> 00:11:22.180\nMake sure I tell you right here,\n\n195\n00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:27.540\nEnable-PSRemoting and\nthen I'm gonna do -Force.\n\n196\n00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.760\nAnd in a moment here I should actually be\nwhere it just kind of gives me another\n\n197\n00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.040\ncommand prompt that everything is done but\nit does take a moment here.\n\n198\n00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.250\nAnd I'm just verifying that hey, we're\nactually allowing this to be done, so\n\n199\n00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.050\non both sides you'll\nprobably see this done.\n\n200\n00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.040\n&gt;&gt; And this is actually a really important\ncommand that Ronnie is showing you,\n\n201\n00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.190\nbecause let's say you are trying\nto manage a computer remotely and\n\n202\n00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:56.070\nyou don't have someone who is very\nfamiliar with doing that on-site.\n\n203\n00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:59.970\nSo if you can get remote management set\nup and you can walk them through this\n\n204\n00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:04.660\nprocess, then you can hop in the driver\nseat with that remote connection there.\n\n205\n00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:09.280\n&gt;&gt; So let's verify that this is now\nconnected and also ready to go.\n\n206\n00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.770\nSo there's another command which,\nwinrm, Windows remote management,\n\n207\n00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.570\nand I'm just trying to get that\nremote management configuration.\n\n208\n00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.420\nNow let me zoom out.\n\n209\n00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:24.376\nSometimes it gets a little bit sticky\nwhen I don't do that, there we go.\n\n210\n00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:27.192\nAnd now if I scroll back\nup through here I can see,\n\n211\n00:12:27.192 --> 00:12:31.250\nright over here on the left-hand side,\nit lists my configuration and\n\n212\n00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:35.780\nsome of the information that I'm\nlooking for if everything is good.\n\n213\n00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:41.975\nThat is the host that I'm looking for\nwhich is TrustedHosts o365-dc01.\n\n214\n00:12:41.975 --> 00:12:46.169\nThis is because I use this in\nearlier series on Office 365, and\n\n215\n00:12:46.169 --> 00:12:49.230\nnotice there's my domain controller dc01.\n\n216\n00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:52.265\nAnd you can see some of these different\nconnections that we're actually\n\n217\n00:12:52.265 --> 00:12:53.470\nallowed to have.\n\n218\n00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:57.080\nSo this shows us the Windows\nremote management configuration,\n\n219\n00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.860\nthat it is set up and ready to go.\n\n220\n00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.270\nThe other aspect of this now of course is,\nI need to get connected.\n\n221\n00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:08.514\nSo if I know that I'm gonna be doing\na lot of PowerShell management,\n\n222\n00:13:08.514 --> 00:13:13.205\nthat means I also need to send some of\nthese commands through the PowerShell\n\n223\n00:13:13.205 --> 00:13:16.267\nover to that Office 365 or o365-dc01.\n\n224\n00:13:16.267 --> 00:13:18.839\nI now need to connect to that machine, so\n\n225\n00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:22.450\nI'm gonna open up a remote\nPowerShell session.\n\n226\n00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.598\nSo Enter-PSSession and\n\n227\n00:13:26.598 --> 00:13:33.106\nthen I type in -ComputerName o365-dc01,\n\n228\n00:13:33.106 --> 00:13:38.670\nand here,\nI'm gonna enter in my credentials as well.\n\n229\n00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:44.563\nAnd this time I have to do\nthe officeprodemoco\\ and\n\n230\n00:13:44.563 --> 00:13:48.408\nthe administrator name is joey.\n\n231\n00:13:48.408 --> 00:13:53.021\nNow, I have to make sure I can\ntype in his credentials and\n\n232\n00:13:53.021 --> 00:13:57.160\nthat's the hardest part for\nme, making sure.\n\n233\n00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.040\nAnd now we can see the difference\nin the prompt here, Cherokee.\n\n234\n00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.020\nNotice what's happening right here, right?\n\n235\n00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.670\nSo let me,\nI'm not zooming in super efficiently now.\n\n236\n00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.792\nSo once I did the Enter-PSSession,\nI typed in the computer name.\n\n237\n00:14:09.792 --> 00:14:13.337\nNow remember that this means\nthat DNS is working fine, cuz if\n\n238\n00:14:13.337 --> 00:14:18.440\nyou're not doing this and it's not working\nit could be DNS is not working either.\n\n239\n00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.340\nMake sure you also spelled\nthe credentials correctly.\n\n240\n00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:25.340\nBut now notice I have these\nsquare brackets over here\n\n241\n00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:29.930\nindicating that now this is running\non that remote machine instead.\n\n242\n00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:34.040\nSo, my machine, let me show you\na couple of things about my machine\n\n243\n00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.490\nthat verifies that this\nis a remote connection.\n\n244\n00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:43.723\nIs you can see my IP address right here,\nI have it up here, 172.16.89.175.\n\n245\n00:14:43.723 --> 00:14:46.968\nBut if I run, let's say,\n\n246\n00:14:46.968 --> 00:14:52.580\nipconfig /all, now if I scroll down,\nyou can take a look and\n\n247\n00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:58.460\nsee my IP address is actually the IP\naddress of the domain controller.\n\n248\n00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.960\nSo I'm actually running this command,\nbut it's actually retrieving it\n\n249\n00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.530\nfrom the domain controller,\nbecause it's getting it from where?\n\n250\n00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.190\nOffice 365-dc01.\n\n251\n00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:11.020\nSo that's what we're seeing\nas we go on through.\n\n252\n00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:15.230\nSo it allows us to be able to know\nthat with PowerShell I can manage\n\n253\n00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.540\neverything there.\n\n254\n00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:20.900\nNow you might be wondering, Ronnie,\nPowerShell, we even had it in our chat,\n\n255\n00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.280\nright, who wants to deal with\nPowerShell all day long?\n\n256\n00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.640\nNot everybody does, and I understand that.\n\n257\n00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.900\nIt makes sense.\n\n258\n00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.900\nBut you are gonna be pushed towards that.\n\n259\n00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.270\nBut let's say that we\ndon't want to do that.\n\n260\n00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:36.341\nWell, the great thing is, whether you're\non another server machine like I am.\n\n261\n00:15:36.341 --> 00:15:39.362\nUsually, though, the best practice,\nadministratively,\n\n262\n00:15:39.362 --> 00:15:43.195\nis if you don't have a dedicated machine\nto do that type of remote management,\n\n263\n00:15:43.195 --> 00:15:47.310\nwhat if you're doing it from,\nlet's say, your client machine instead?\n\n264\n00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:51.720\nSo on your own Windows 10 desktop, so\nlet me switch on over and here it is,\n\n265\n00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.896\nI'm on my own Windows 10 desktop.\n\n266\n00:15:53.896 --> 00:15:56.245\nYou can go out to the Internet and\n\n267\n00:15:56.245 --> 00:16:00.341\ndownload something that we\ncall the Windows 10 RSAT.\n\n268\n00:16:00.341 --> 00:16:02.949\nRemote server administration tools,\n\n269\n00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:07.100\ndownload that particular tool kit,\nand install it.\n\n270\n00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:12.213\nAnd when you do install it what you should\nend up with inside of your start menu,\n\n271\n00:16:12.213 --> 00:16:15.233\nif I scroll all the way\ndown here to the bottom,\n\n272\n00:16:15.233 --> 00:16:20.445\nis you should end up with a set of tools\nthat says Windows Administrative Tools.\n\n273\n00:16:20.445 --> 00:16:22.795\nAnd now if I click on\nthat you'll notice for\n\n274\n00:16:22.795 --> 00:16:26.583\nthose of you that had server knowledge or\nserver experience before,\n\n275\n00:16:26.583 --> 00:16:30.970\nnotice there is the Active Directory\nAdministrative Center's here.\n\n276\n00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:35.647\nThe Active Directory Domains and\nTrust, the Active Directory Module for\n\n277\n00:16:35.647 --> 00:16:40.785\nPowerShell, Sites and Services and\nthe Active Directory Users and Computers.\n\n278\n00:16:40.785 --> 00:16:44.430\nIf I select that, it now asks me to\nprovide those network credentials.\n\n279\n00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:50.960\nThat allows me to be\nable to connect right in.\n\n280\n00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:59.720\nAnd here, you can end up seeing,\nlet me stretch it all the way out,\n\n281\n00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.290\nour name's a little bit long there.\n\n282\n00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:04.620\n&gt;&gt; Officeprodemoco.\n\n283\n00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.960\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's the name that we're using.\n\n284\n00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.904\nSo, there it is.\nI am now getting that from Office 365-DC01\n\n285\n00:17:11.904 --> 00:17:13.740\nand there it is.\n\n286\n00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.440\nThere's the domain and there's all my\nActive Directory users and computers.\n\n287\n00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.250\nEverything is set up just like this.\n\n288\n00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.692\nI am not directly on\nthe domain controller.\n\n289\n00:17:23.692 --> 00:17:26.510\nSo, this gives that particular ability and\n\n290\n00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:31.612\naspect where I am now managing things\nthe way that it's supposed to be, which is\n\n291\n00:17:31.612 --> 00:17:36.810\nnot directly on the domain controller\nitself, but by using remote management.\n\n292\n00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.730\nAnd that's one of the key\nfeatures that we can do.\n\n293\n00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:44.070\nIn a client environment, you're gonna\nuse the RSAT tools probably more often.\n\n294\n00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:47.889\nInside of a management server,\nthe PowerShell just like I showed you,\n\n295\n00:17:47.889 --> 00:17:50.700\nyou're probably gonna see\nthat more often as well.\n\n296\n00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.549\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, I know we've\ntalked about in other episodes,\n\n297\n00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:59.710\nmaybe perhaps even limiting remote\nmanagement from a security perspective.\n\n298\n00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:03.530\nBut what would be some of the reasons\nas to why we would want to go ahead and\n\n299\n00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.900\nmanage Active Directory remotely?\n\n300\n00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:10.123\n&gt;&gt; Well managing Active Directory remotely\nis key and critical because remember,\n\n301\n00:18:10.123 --> 00:18:13.663\nyour domain controller part of\nthe critical infrastructure of your\n\n302\n00:18:13.663 --> 00:18:15.168\nActive Directory network.\n\n303\n00:18:15.168 --> 00:18:19.499\nSo that's not something that we really\nwant people just kind of going,\n\n304\n00:18:19.499 --> 00:18:21.820\nI don't have another machine to use.\n\n305\n00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:25.178\nLet me just go ahead and\ngo on to the domain controller and\n\n306\n00:18:25.178 --> 00:18:27.615\nstart managing it directly from there.\n\n307\n00:18:27.615 --> 00:18:33.440\nSo you're allowing more exposure if you\nmanage it directly from there as well.\n\n308\n00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.158\nThe other thing that we also want to do\nis wanna stop people from saying that,\n\n309\n00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:39.250\nhere it is.\n\n310\n00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:44.064\nAs I run this command I realize I need to\ndo something else so they just download\n\n311\n00:18:44.064 --> 00:18:49.111\nthe Adobe Acrobat Reader and they\ninstall that onto the domain controller.\n\n312\n00:18:49.111 --> 00:18:52.940\nThere's a print server I need to install,-\n&gt;&gt; End up with a lot of bloatware.\n\n313\n00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.580\n&gt;&gt; Then you download all\nthe drivers directly on there.\n\n314\n00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.170\nThe more that you put\nthat onto that server,\n\n315\n00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.530\nright, the more resources\nthat are gonna be taken up.\n\n316\n00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:04.840\nBut it is a part of the infrastructure\nwe really don't want to mess with.\n\n317\n00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.720\nSo, if we have that server,\n\n318\n00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.960\nwe wanna make sure that it's doing\nexactly what it needs to be doing.\n\n319\n00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.030\nSo, we wanna minimize\nthe number of applications,\n\n320\n00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.880\nthe number of tools that we have\nreadily available for there.\n\n321\n00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.390\nIt allows for the single machine or\nsingle virtual machine that we're on\n\n322\n00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:23.690\nto have the fully dedicated\nuse of its RAM, a CPU,\n\n323\n00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.780\nand everything to do what it needs to do\nas part of that critical infrastructure so\n\n324\n00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.490\nwe're not messing around with\nits natural way of doing things.\n\n325\n00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:37.639\nIt shouldn't be serving up another server\nat the same time if you can help it.\n\n326\n00:19:37.639 --> 00:19:40.521\nSometimes, though,\nyou can only do what you can do, and\n\n327\n00:19:40.521 --> 00:19:43.870\nthat's the reality of all\nserver management, right?\n\n328\n00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:47.891\nNot everything's gonna be set up exactly\nthe way that Microsoft wants it to be set\n\n329\n00:19:47.891 --> 00:19:49.561\nup, so you have to do what you do.\n\n330\n00:19:49.561 --> 00:19:51.826\nAnd I do that,\neven inside of a lab environment,\n\n331\n00:19:51.826 --> 00:19:56.550\nbecause I know the limitations of what I'm\ngonna be running my lab environment on.\n\n332\n00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:02.960\nIn a lab environment I may run multiple\nservers on a single instance of a VM.\n\n333\n00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.970\nBut in reality and ideally, I shouldn't.\n\n334\n00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.390\nI should actually kinda separate those\nout if I have that capacity to do so.\n\n335\n00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:14.437\nSo managing things remotely is always\nbetter, okay, than actually going\n\n336\n00:20:14.437 --> 00:20:19.910\ndirectly to domain controller which is\njust gonna be limited to those people.\n\n337\n00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:20.697\nAnd don't forget,\n\n338\n00:20:20.697 --> 00:20:23.667\nyou really can't log in to domain\ncontroller if you're not a domain admin.\n\n339\n00:20:23.667 --> 00:20:27.572\n&gt;&gt; So essentially by implementing\nalso our access controls there,\n\n340\n00:20:27.572 --> 00:20:32.650\nwe kinda wanna keep those additional\ncooks out of the kitchen so to speak.\n\n341\n00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:36.880\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that that's actually a\nbig part of what we have to be able to do.\n\n342\n00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.186\nNow the other side of this right is,\nCherokee,\n\n343\n00:20:39.186 --> 00:20:41.966\nwe're familiar with\nremote-desktop as well, right?\n\n344\n00:20:41.966 --> 00:20:45.898\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I mean, we don't really wanna\nbe connecting directly to those domain\n\n345\n00:20:45.898 --> 00:20:49.030\ncontrollers using remote-desktop,\nbut why, Ronnie?\n\n346\n00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well the idea here\nis with remote-desktop, okay,\n\n347\n00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.041\nif you're not familiar of that,\nmost of you probably are.\n\n348\n00:20:55.041 --> 00:20:58.400\nRemember that what you're doing is\nthat you're taking control of that\n\n349\n00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.990\nmachine itself.\n\n350\n00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:01.010\nAnd when you do that,\n\n351\n00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:05.420\nyou're also limiting access to that\nmachine in a couple of different ways.\n\n352\n00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:09.920\nThere's only two remote desktop\nconnections allowed at any one time.\n\n353\n00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.337\nSo if you're logged in and\nanother person's logged in, but\n\n354\n00:21:13.337 --> 00:21:17.893\nlet's say that somebody really does need\nto make a chain, a change, excuse me,\n\n355\n00:21:17.893 --> 00:21:20.789\ninside of your Active Directory\nstructure there.\n\n356\n00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:25.250\nBut now you, or the other person, or both\npeople are logged in at the same time.\n\n357\n00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.507\nAnd if you're like me,\nyou end up finding out something.\n\n358\n00:21:28.507 --> 00:21:30.362\nWhich I know I've seen this happen.\n\n359\n00:21:30.362 --> 00:21:33.990\nWhere someone says, yeah, just log\nin to domain control and change us.\n\n360\n00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:38.170\nAnd I try and make the connection and it\nsays, hey, there's no sessions available.\n\n361\n00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.710\nYou can't log in.\n\n362\n00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:42.080\nWell that now becomes frustrating\n\n363\n00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.630\nbecause I don't know if the person's\nactively doing something or\n\n364\n00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.939\nif they just did, when I find out when\nI go and ask them like, are logged into\n\n365\n00:21:48.939 --> 00:21:50.680\ndomain controllers on premises, they go\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n366\n00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.485\n&gt;&gt; No I just forgot.\n\n367\n00:21:51.485 --> 00:21:52.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just forgot.\n\n368\n00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:53.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, about that.\n\n369\n00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so now you're wondering like,\n\n370\n00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.335\nis there anything that you need\nto save before I disconnect you?\n\n371\n00:21:59.335 --> 00:22:01.610\nOr what is going on, are you in\nthe middle of installing something?\n\n372\n00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:03.800\nAre you in the middle\nof changing something?\n\n373\n00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:08.989\nThat can become very much something\nthat can be damaging if we do that.\n\n374\n00:22:08.989 --> 00:22:12.130\nSo we wanna make sure\nthat we understand this.\n\n375\n00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:16.570\nThat idea of logging on really does\nlimit what the domain controller can do,\n\n376\n00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.520\nespecially if two people just\nstay logged in all the time.\n\n377\n00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:24.570\nThe other thing, of course, is that when\nyou use remote desktop connection and\n\n378\n00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:29.460\nthe protocol, everything that you do is\ngonna be powered on the server itself.\n\n379\n00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.037\nSo not just retrieving the information and\ncrunching the data on your end,\n\n380\n00:22:33.037 --> 00:22:36.555\nit really is having to do everything\nthat it's having to do on this side and\n\n381\n00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:38.224\nnow sending you just the results.\n\n382\n00:22:38.224 --> 00:22:42.724\nSo that sounds cool, probably on a super\nbig beefy machine, but it's really\n\n383\n00:22:42.724 --> 00:22:47.168\nnot something you want to do on your\ndomain controller if you don't need it.\n\n384\n00:22:47.168 --> 00:22:50.160\nNow, inside a lab environment,\nright, it doesn't matter.\n\n385\n00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:55.150\nThe domain controller's really not gonna\nbe super critical in a lab environment.\n\n386\n00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:59.808\nBut inside of a business that's really\nbusy, that's constantly having people log\n\n387\n00:22:59.808 --> 00:23:03.427\nin, log off, changes in terms of hires and\nwhatever it might be.\n\n388\n00:23:03.427 --> 00:23:07.960\nThis becomes more critical and it's\nsomething we don't want to actually do.\n\n389\n00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.940\nSo we wanna make sure that we\nunderstand that this is really\n\n390\n00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:16.900\na critical aspect of the way that things\nshould be done in terms of best practice.\n\n391\n00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.014\nSo make sure you kind of remember that.\n\n392\n00:23:19.014 --> 00:23:24.290\nNow let me tell you the [LAUGH]\nreality of a lot of things, right?\n\n393\n00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:26.475\nIn the administrative world,\n\n394\n00:23:26.475 --> 00:23:29.988\nit's really gonna depend on who\nyour network administrator is.\n\n395\n00:23:29.988 --> 00:23:33.640\nSo if you're just coming up into the ranks\nwhere you're now starting to work with\n\n396\n00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.470\nservers, you may just be told, just go\nahead and remote desktop into the server.\n\n397\n00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:42.070\nNow does that mean, Cherokee, that I\nshould say, no I should never do that.\n\n398\n00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.057\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie told us.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n399\n00:23:43.057 --> 00:23:46.002\nRonnie said that I should never do that.\n\n400\n00:23:46.002 --> 00:23:50.839\nIt means you got to do what you got to do,\nbut in reality, right, the best practice\n\n401\n00:23:50.839 --> 00:23:54.854\nis to leave the domain controller\nalone and use these remote tools.\n\n402\n00:23:54.854 --> 00:23:59.349\nBecause that is really, especially in\ntoday's environment of compliance and\n\n403\n00:23:59.349 --> 00:24:03.520\nin today's environment of security\nworries that we have to worry about.\n\n404\n00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.596\nWe wanna make sure that we\nare limiting the access that we can,\n\n405\n00:24:06.596 --> 00:24:09.270\nbut still being able to do\nthe stuff that we need to do.\n\n406\n00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:13.388\nSo, it's a balance of the functionality\nas well as security and\n\n407\n00:24:13.388 --> 00:24:15.660\nsome of the other thing\nwe have to think about.\n\n408\n00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.220\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie it seems like a lot\nresponsibility when we're talking about\n\n409\n00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.750\nmanaging multiple servers.\n\n410\n00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:25.180\nAnd I don't want you to feel like\nit's something that you can't do,\n\n411\n00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.460\nlike it's overwhelming.\n\n412\n00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.510\nSo Ronnie,\ndo you have any suggestions or tips, or\n\n413\n00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.070\nwhat can we do to make\nthis process easier?\n\n414\n00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.547\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a few things\nthat we can do, right?\n\n415\n00:24:33.547 --> 00:24:34.510\nI just showed you one.\n\n416\n00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:38.934\nUsing that remote server adminstration\ntool Is probably the easiest thing that\n\n417\n00:24:38.934 --> 00:24:41.360\nyou can actually end up doing.\n\n418\n00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.740\nBut there are times, though, you need to\nhave more than just something like that\n\n419\n00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.300\nto be able to do everything\nthat you wanna do.\n\n420\n00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.460\nBut if you don't have that, you can\nactually change it around a little bit.\n\n421\n00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.600\nSo let's go back to my machine\nhere just for a moment.\n\n422\n00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.640\nAnd that way, we'll see something.\n\n423\n00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.540\nI just minimized the PowerShell.\n\n424\n00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.790\nThere is something else you can do to\nhelp customize the enviroment that you're\n\n425\n00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.120\nin to help you out.\n\n426\n00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:07.550\nSo here I am on\na Windows Server 2016 machine.\n\n427\n00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:11.490\nI'm going to click on the little search\nwindow here, I'm gonna type in MMC.\n\n428\n00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:15.270\nAnd that's gonna bring up\nsomething that we call a blank\n\n429\n00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.680\nMicrosoft Management Console.\n\n430\n00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.370\nAnd inside of this\nMicrosoft Management Console,\n\n431\n00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:27.020\nyou're gonna see that there's not any\ntools that are actually available to us.\n\n432\n00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.210\nWell this great because I can actually\n\n433\n00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:33.350\nfill this particular column\nwith different tools.\n\n434\n00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.710\nAnd not only is it great because of that.\n\n435\n00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:39.830\nI can also connect to a remote\nmachine to do this for us as well.\n\n436\n00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:43.070\nSo let me click on file to show\nyou what I'm talking about.\n\n437\n00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:47.230\nIf I select file, and\nadd and remove snap in.\n\n438\n00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:50.840\nNotice I have these different\nsnap ins that I can add in.\n\n439\n00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.610\nSo for example,\nlet's say that I wanted to be able to take\n\n440\n00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:57.330\na look at some of\nthe different services here.\n\n441\n00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.440\nLet's just do computer management,\nfor example, here.\n\n442\n00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.090\nI can click on add.\n\n443\n00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:03.105\nAnd if I do this,\n\n444\n00:26:03.105 --> 00:26:07.326\nnow notice that it gives me the option\nof connecting to another tool.\n\n445\n00:26:07.326 --> 00:26:11.504\nSo let me select another computer,\n\n446\n00:26:11.504 --> 00:26:16.247\nand then here I can do the o365dco1.\n\n447\n00:26:16.247 --> 00:26:18.322\nLet me zoom out for a moment.\n\n448\n00:26:18.322 --> 00:26:21.840\nIt gets locked in my zoom sometimes.\n\n449\n00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.410\nAnd now notice I get\nthe computer management.\n\n450\n00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:27.240\nI can come down here to,\nlet's say event viewer.\n\n451\n00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.423\nAnd I wanted to make sure\nthat I got all of the events.\n\n452\n00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.600\nOops that's a zero I did.\n\n453\n00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:35.510\nNo, that is an O.\n\n454\n00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:36.689\nOkay, I just wanted to make sure.\n\n455\n00:26:39.526 --> 00:26:44.124\nDC01 That zoom has really\ngot me locked in there.\n\n456\n00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:49.006\nSo in a moment, it's connecting, so\n\n457\n00:26:49.006 --> 00:26:51.910\nwe'll give it a moment here\nto see what's happening.\n\n458\n00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:54.290\nSo this one looks like it's\ntaking a little bit longer.\n\n459\n00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:58.010\nBut it gives me this ability to continue\nto create these different tools.\n\n460\n00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:59.170\nHopefully it's not gonna fail, but\n\n461\n00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:00.830\nit looks like it's just\ntaking its sweet time.\n\n462\n00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:04.820\n&gt;&gt; And we can add different tools into\nour customized little toolbox there,\n\n463\n00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:06.120\nour management console.\n\n464\n00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.520\n&gt;&gt; Right, so let's see.\n\n465\n00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.370\nThis one says it can't be connected.\n\n466\n00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:11.050\nAll right.\n\n467\n00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:11.980\nWell, let's try another one.\n\n468\n00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:14.190\nJust let's see what we can do for\nright now.\n\n469\n00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:15.420\nSo local computer.\n\n470\n00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.590\nLet's see if I can do that.\n\n471\n00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:19.495\nLet's do this on another computer.\n\n472\n00:27:31.326 --> 00:27:32.930\nThe username, okay?\n\n473\n00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:34.754\nSo yeah, I'm just kind of picking and\n\n474\n00:27:34.754 --> 00:27:37.837\nchoosing some different ones that\nare out there and available.\n\n475\n00:27:37.837 --> 00:27:39.404\nBut that's how you do it, right?\n\n476\n00:27:39.404 --> 00:27:43.510\nSo I was just gonna add in a different\none, but right now it looks like it's\n\n477\n00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:48.550\nhaving a sweet time in trying to do\nanything else but this one machine.\n\n478\n00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:49.537\nLet me do this.\n\n479\n00:27:49.537 --> 00:27:52.056\n365DCO1.\n\n480\n00:27:52.056 --> 00:27:53.473\nLet's try one more here.\n\n481\n00:27:53.473 --> 00:27:54.550\nThere we go.\n\n482\n00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:58.536\nSo now, I'm just adding in some\ndifferent tools to help us out.\n\n483\n00:27:58.536 --> 00:28:02.970\nNotice that all of this is connecting\ninto another machine to allow us to do\n\n484\n00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:04.270\nthat as well.\n\n485\n00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:07.920\nSo the combination of using the remote\nserver administration tools\n\n486\n00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.650\non a client computer, using something\nlike the Management Console,\n\n487\n00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:15.400\nallows us to be able to set\nsomething like this if we choose to.\n\n488\n00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.247\nAnd that way, we can then save this.\n\n489\n00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.526\nSo if I select save as,\nnotice it's gonna save it underneath\n\n490\n00:28:23.526 --> 00:28:27.990\nthe Windows Administrative Tools,\nand we can call it Ronnie's oop.\n\n491\n00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:29.420\nWhatever I call it, Ronnie.\n\n492\n00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:33.720\nSo at that point, you can always do a\nsearch and find that particular tool kit,\n\n493\n00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.210\nand it will bring it right up, and\nyou'll be able to manage that again.\n\n494\n00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:40.680\nSo it allows us to work\nwith some different\n\n495\n00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.020\nways to manage that remote machine.\n\n496\n00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.760\nSo whether we're actually talking about\nthe physical machine, which is what I'm\n\n497\n00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.350\ndoing right here in the MMC, or using\nthe remote server administration tool.\n\n498\n00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.470\nLet me switch on over,\nthe toolkit over here.\n\n499\n00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:59.240\nAnd let me show you one more\ntime under administration tools.\n\n500\n00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:03.200\nYou can see that there is\na lot available right here for\n\n501\n00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.194\nyou to actually be able to look through.\n\n502\n00:29:06.194 --> 00:29:11.166\nSo there is DHCP, DNS,\nevent viewer, you name it,\n\n503\n00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:15.110\ngroup policy management as well.\n\n504\n00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:20.010\nAnd on this machine, you can even create\nthat MMC to add all those utilities in\n\n505\n00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:27.350\nthere as one unit, too, instead of having\nto see them inside of that menu instead.\n\n506\n00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:30.700\nSo remote management,\nit is kind of the beginning and\n\n507\n00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.690\nthe essential part of understanding\nthe basics of management.\n\n508\n00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:37.950\nBut now that we have that in hand,\nwe really need to\n\n509\n00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:43.120\nthink about the idea here of talking about\nwhat we call organizational units as well.\n\n510\n00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:43.850\nBut Cherokee,\n\n511\n00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:47.790\nit looks like that I've ran us out of time\nin just talking about remote management.\n\n512\n00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:50.980\nSo I guess we need to kind\nof cut that off right now.\n\n513\n00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:51.820\n&gt;&gt; That's all right, Ronnie.\n\n514\n00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.900\nThat can definitely happen when you're\ntalking about Active Directory,\n\n515\n00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.020\nlike you had mentioned.\n\n516\n00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.310\nWe could go for days on Active Directory.\n\n517\n00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:01.240\nBut for this show,\nwe are gonna go ahead and call it quits.\n\n518\n00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.130\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n519\n00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:03.862\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n520\n00:30:03.862 --> 00:30:07.221\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPROTV.\n\n521\n00:30:07.221 --> 00:30:12.999\n[MUSIC].\n\n522\n00:30:12.999 --> 00:30:20.030\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPROTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.466\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:12.126\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:16.865\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your to your Server 101\nseries, I'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.865 --> 00:00:17.615\nIn this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:17.615 --> 00:00:21.555\nwe'll continue taking a look at our\nbasic Active Directory functions.\n\n8\n00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:23.815\nWith us today, in studios, we have Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.995\nRonnie Wong, thank you for\njoining us today, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:28.695\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back for\nthe Part 2 after I ran on so\n\n11\n00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.295\nlong with the Part 1.\n\n12\n00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:36.260\nWe are back and we are ready to take a\nlook at the administrative side of things.\n\n13\n00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.220\nI know I spend a good deal of time\non just focusing in on the remote\n\n14\n00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.350\nadministration, but\n\n15\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.080\nit is something that we should be doing in\nthe real world as much as we can, right?\n\n16\n00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.460\nBut remember that, wherever you go,\nif you're just getting hired on,\n\n17\n00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.220\nyou're gonna do it their way.\n\n18\n00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.700\nBut keep in mind the best practice as you\nstart to move forward into your career\n\n19\n00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.740\nworking with servers.\n\n20\n00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.310\nNext unit that we want to talk\nabout of course is this breakdown\n\n21\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.480\nof the administrative side\nof things a little bit more.\n\n22\n00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.589\nSo let's go back to my screen as I\nre-emphasize something I did in Part 1,\n\n23\n00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:11.701\nwhere I essentially showed you the\nbreakdown of how some of the terminology\n\n24\n00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:12.693\nends up working.\n\n25\n00:01:12.693 --> 00:01:15.718\nWhen you start talking about\nthe idea of a forest, right,\n\n26\n00:01:15.718 --> 00:01:19.640\nremember that that is the security\nboundary of Active Directory.\n\n27\n00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.420\nSo when you set up everything,\n\n28\n00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.130\nright, that is when we start setting\nsecurity, we're talking about that.\n\n29\n00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.290\nRemember that a single domain can\nalso be a forest unto itself.\n\n30\n00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.460\nIt doesn't have to be where there's always\nmultiple domains that creates a forest.\n\n31\n00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.610\nBut a single domain can also\nbe a single forest as well.\n\n32\n00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.330\nSo we can set up security boundaries for\nthat too.\n\n33\n00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.090\nAdministratively though, even though\nthis is essentially our administrative\n\n34\n00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.530\nboundary, it's a gigantic\nadministrative boundary, right?\n\n35\n00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.053\nAnd my domain is large,\nand I have 5,000 users and\n\n36\n00:01:52.053 --> 00:01:57.130\n7,000 computers and\n1,000 plus servers out there, right?\n\n37\n00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.360\nThat's a huge domain to have to try and\nmanage.\n\n38\n00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.440\nWhat if I have 16, 17, or\n100 different departments?\n\n39\n00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.600\nIt becomes much more difficult to\nmanage everything at a domain level,\n\n40\n00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.310\nespecially when people start to say, hey,\nwe need certain requirements over here.\n\n41\n00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.690\nWe need certain security,\ndifferent type of security over here.\n\n42\n00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.850\nWe need this requirement, and here's what\nthe machine should look like when they log\n\n43\n00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.600\non to my domain or\nmy department over here.\n\n44\n00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.000\nWhen you start doing that, now you\nhave to break it down even further.\n\n45\n00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.750\nNow I didn't do that here because\nwe're about to talk about this idea\n\n46\n00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.020\nof what we call organizational units,\nis what we're about to talk about here.\n\n47\n00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.368\nSo that's where we're going.\n\n48\n00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:44.254\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Ronnie, I'm assuming you\nare gonna be talking about why we would\n\n49\n00:02:44.254 --> 00:02:48.380\nwanna go ahead to create and actually\nutilize organizational units, right?\n\n50\n00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.664\n&gt;&gt; Right, now this is where we do get\nsome, I remember I was a little bit\n\n51\n00:02:51.664 --> 00:02:55.140\nconfused about it the first time\nthat I learned about it here.\n\n52\n00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.570\nWhen it was being explained to me,\nI always thought organizational units,\n\n53\n00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.690\nit's just about the idea of,\nwell, organization, right?\n\n54\n00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.060\nThe term organizational unit, it means\nhow I want stuff to be structured and\n\n55\n00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.880\nto be filed correctly and to be placed,\ncategorized, and stuff like that.\n\n56\n00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.880\nWell, the more than I thought about\nsomething like that, it didn't actually\n\n57\n00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.970\nmake sense when we try to apply things\nlike Group Policy to because it really is\n\n58\n00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.080\nterrible in terms of organizational,\nlogical organization like that.\n\n59\n00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.230\nLet me give you an example\nof what I'm talking about.\n\n60\n00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.140\nFor me, logically,\n\n61\n00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.370\nI would actually organize,\nlets say, client machines, right?\n\n62\n00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.660\nI might have some Windows 10 machines.\n\n63\n00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.610\nBut let's say I also have some\nWindows 7 machines as well.\n\n64\n00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.920\nThose are scattered\nthroughout my organization.\n\n65\n00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.810\nBut if this is the first time I'm working\nwith them, I go, organization units?\n\n66\n00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.410\nI should categorize what?\n\n67\n00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.470\nAll the Windows 7 computers together.\n\n68\n00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.250\nI should categorize all\nthe Windows 10 computers together.\n\n69\n00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.610\nSo even if those Windows 10 computers are\nof different departments all across, well,\n\n70\n00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.040\nhow do I set up policy for all of those\ndifferent computers that are inside\n\n71\n00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.030\nof that Windows 10 organizational unit?\n\n72\n00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.360\nOr the Windows 7 computers?\n\n73\n00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.670\nHow do I do that when they're all part\nof different parts of my organization?\n\n74\n00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.780\nI can't.\n\n75\n00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.230\nOrganizational units are really\nabout administrative delegation.\n\n76\n00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.500\nIn other words, when you want to make sure\nthat you have efficient delegation here.\n\n77\n00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.300\nThe ability to say, I'm going to\nallow this person to have rights,\n\n78\n00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.540\nover these machines, and\neven over maybe users or\n\n79\n00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.670\nwhatever other objects inside of Active\nDirectory that we want to put them in.\n\n80\n00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.680\nSo when you start using\norganizational units,\n\n81\n00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.110\nit's about how do I want\nadministrative control to be handled.\n\n82\n00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.270\nIt's not really about my logical desire\nto put things in easy categories, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.910\nSo don't use them as a folder structure,\nokay?\n\n84\n00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.288\nBut use them as a way of how would\nI want the management to happen.\n\n85\n00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:52.870\nIf there is a department,\nhow do I want that to be managed?\n\n86\n00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.760\nDon't think about organizing in terms of,\nlike I said, the categorization.\n\n87\n00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.384\nBut organizing in terms of management unit\nis what you're really taking a look at\n\n88\n00:05:00.384 --> 00:05:02.000\nwhen you start doing that.\n\n89\n00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.740\nSo you need that efficiency because your\norganization is beginning to grow large,\n\n90\n00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.665\nand you need a brand new\nletter to get in control.\n\n91\n00:05:07.665 --> 00:05:11.450\nOrganizational units are why we\nwant to create that as well, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.650\nSo that's one of the reasons\nto be able to do that.\n\n93\n00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.110\nNow the other reason of course, as we\nstart to see this, is that we want to be\n\n94\n00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.930\nable to have different controls\non those delegations too.\n\n95\n00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.670\nSo in other words,\nas I start to push out policy,\n\n96\n00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.318\nI want this policy to effect that unit,\nbut not that other unit.\n\n97\n00:05:31.318 --> 00:05:35.560\nSo it gives us that ability,\nnot only for efficient delegation, but\n\n98\n00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.190\nalso for efficient enforcement\nof policy if we want to as well.\n\n99\n00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.960\nSo there's a few reasons to do it.\n\n100\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.671\nBut those are kind of the two main reasons\nfor right now of why we would choose to\n\n101\n00:05:47.671 --> 00:05:50.440\nactually create this idea as we do so,\nokay?\n\n102\n00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.118\n&gt;&gt; And by thinking about that,\nwhat was the term you used there,\n\n103\n00:05:54.118 --> 00:05:56.680\nthe administrative delegation concept?\n\n104\n00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.380\nYeah, so,\n\n105\n00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.016\nnot just people in the IT department can\nkind of wrap their brains around that.\n\n106\n00:06:02.016 --> 00:06:05.871\nThat's something that even from a business\nperspective, which makes it easier,\n\n107\n00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:09.120\nlike if you're working with human\nresources, to help coordinate and\n\n108\n00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.126\nhave these conversations when you're\nonboarding and bringing people in.\n\n109\n00:06:13.126 --> 00:06:16.780\nBut like Ronnie says, from his mind, from\na technical standpoint, he's thinking,\n\n110\n00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.430\nokay, let's go ahead and group them by\ndifferent operating systems and so forth.\n\n111\n00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.700\nBut you can go ahead and still manage\nin that capacity using something like\n\n112\n00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:31.080\nMicrosoft's WMI, the Windows Management\nInstrumentation, and things like that.\n\n113\n00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.832\nBut just Active Directory, like he said,\nthink of it as more, almost like a,\n\n114\n00:06:35.832 --> 00:06:40.584\nI kinda think of it as role-based when\nyou talk about different types of access\n\n115\n00:06:40.584 --> 00:06:41.527\nmodels there.\n\n116\n00:06:41.527 --> 00:06:45.355\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no doubt that that's\na great way to think about those\n\n117\n00:06:45.355 --> 00:06:46.746\norganizational units.\n\n118\n00:06:46.746 --> 00:06:51.259\nSo lets talk about this idea of,\nwell, not only creating them, but\n\n119\n00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:55.230\nhow do we do this and\nhow do we do it remotely is kinda the key.\n\n120\n00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.020\nNormally, if it were just me and myself\nand probably the only one doing this,\n\n121\n00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.400\nI would just go ahead and\nlog in to the domain controller.\n\n122\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.380\nAnd do it right there and\nthat would be it.\n\n123\n00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.850\nThat probably wouldn't harm very\nmuch if I'm really the only IT\n\n124\n00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.050\nperson that's there.\n\n125\n00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.990\nBut as my organization grows larger and\n\n126\n00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.490\nlarger, I really need to make sure that I\nam able to do some of this stuff remotely.\n\n127\n00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.840\nSo we've already talked about\none way to do this, okay?\n\n128\n00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.040\nWe can use\nthe Remote Server Administration Tools and\n\n129\n00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.730\ninstall them into the Windows client and\n\n130\n00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:31.970\nthen we are off and ready to go to\ncreate an organizational unit that way.\n\n131\n00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.800\nBut let's say that we are set apart for\n\n132\n00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.530\nour company, we have a specific\nmanagement server instead.\n\n133\n00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.140\nAnd we're just told that it has to\nbe done from that management server.\n\n134\n00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.300\nThat is where we want to set this up then.\n\n135\n00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.312\nSo let's take a look at my machine and I\npulled up PowerShell because that is kinda\n\n136\n00:07:48.312 --> 00:07:50.914\nthe way that we're gonna\nhave to be looking in here.\n\n137\n00:07:50.914 --> 00:07:56.355\nFrom here, I wanna be able to install in\nthe Remote Server Administration Tools for\n\n138\n00:07:56.355 --> 00:07:57.687\nActive Directory.\n\n139\n00:07:57.687 --> 00:08:01.063\nNow, when you start doing that,\nI'm getting very specific here,\n\n140\n00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:04.490\ntalking about just for\nActive Directory to help us out.\n\n141\n00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:09.500\nSo inside of this I'm going to make\nsure that I'm not on the remote machine.\n\n142\n00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.450\nSo notice I type in exit here and\nhere I am at the PowerShell prompt.\n\n143\n00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.560\nLet me clear out the screen so\nit's actually at the top and\n\n144\n00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.350\nthat way we can see it\na little bit better.\n\n145\n00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.700\nSo let's go ahead and install these\ntools onto the server that I have.\n\n146\n00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:29.626\nI'm gonna use PowerShell right here and\n\n147\n00:08:29.626 --> 00:08:36.388\nInstall-WindowsFeature -Name\n\n148\n00:08:36.388 --> 00:08:40.830\nRSAT- ADDS, right.\n\n149\n00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:46.410\nFor Active Directory domain services\nis what we should have here.\n\n150\n00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.298\nThen, we're gonna include in all\nthe sub features, or all sub features.\n\n151\n00:08:50.298 --> 00:08:56.540\nInclude, if I can spell it,\nall sub feature.\n\n152\n00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.839\nNow, it is actually singular,\nas you take a look at that, so\n\n153\n00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:02.714\nit's something that's\na little bit more unusual.\n\n154\n00:09:02.714 --> 00:09:05.655\nI always do some features and\nthat doesn't always work out.\n\n155\n00:09:05.655 --> 00:09:10.250\nSo from that point, there we go,\nthat should actually end up working.\n\n156\n00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.710\nYou do have to be careful here.\n\n157\n00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.743\nThere's a mistake that\nI know that I've made.\n\n158\n00:09:13.743 --> 00:09:15.934\nAs you try and do some of this stuff,\n\n159\n00:09:15.934 --> 00:09:20.771\nremember to use the name of the command\nand not the display name of the command.\n\n160\n00:09:20.771 --> 00:09:22.676\nAnd that should help out a lot,\n\n161\n00:09:22.676 --> 00:09:27.290\nas far as installing these tools\nthat are available that you have.\n\n162\n00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.770\nDon't forget that if you choose to run\nthose remote server administration tools\n\n163\n00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.870\nfrom the client,\nyou're not gonna have this.\n\n164\n00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.030\nYou gonna instead use the download\nthat you have from the Internet.\n\n165\n00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.360\nThat will actually get you through\nwhat you want to be able to do.\n\n166\n00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.050\nSo this is where it verifies for us,\n\n167\n00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.570\nthat now we have successfully\ninstalled this on the remoter server.\n\n168\n00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:46.790\nSo everything is good.\n\n169\n00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.070\nSo now I have the Active Directory\nAdministration tool, all this,\n\n170\n00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.920\nnow on this remote server\nthat I have access to.\n\n171\n00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.990\nFrom here, if I wanted to create an OU,\nit's fairly simple.\n\n172\n00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:03.239\nNow, I simply type in, I'll say\n\n173\n00:10:03.239 --> 00:10:08.308\nNew-ADOrganizationalUnit.\n\n174\n00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:13.590\nNow that's a long command as we start to\ntake a look there, ADOrganizationalUnit.\n\n175\n00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:17.420\nIt makes sense, but\nit does take a little bit do a name.\n\n176\n00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.350\nNow remember, that if you already set this\nup, right, in the logical organization,\n\n177\n00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:26.160\nwe may instead choose let's say like\na site or a particular location.\n\n178\n00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.980\nSo for example here in Gainesville,\nI may choose the idea of Gainesville and\n\n179\n00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.140\nthat point, hopefully I pressed Enter.\n\n180\n00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.320\nAnd now it's chewing through it and\n\n181\n00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.380\nnow it should actually end\nup creating this OU for us.\n\n182\n00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.400\nIs what we want to be able to do.\n\n183\n00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.260\nIt's because I forgot some credentials.\n\n184\n00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.302\nWell, that would actually help.\n\n185\n00:10:50.169 --> 00:10:51.069\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, so\n\n186\n00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:53.710\nare we gonna go ahead and\nput a username there in that syntax?\n\n187\n00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.820\n&gt;&gt; Well, I did forget it one time, so\nlet me see if I add that in there and\n\n188\n00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.220\nsee if it will actually help.\n\n189\n00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.310\nSo I need the Office Pro demo code.\n\n190\n00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.619\nUsually, typing is pretty much\nthe skill that I really need here.\n\n191\n00:11:04.619 --> 00:11:07.820\nAnd that point now,\nthere we go a little bit better.\n\n192\n00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.300\nUnless I can't remember the password here,\nwhich is very possible.\n\n193\n00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.850\nAnd there we go.\n\n194\n00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.440\nSo now, as I have everything ready,\n\n195\n00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.400\nit shows me that I created\nan organizational unit here.\n\n196\n00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.730\nLet's verify this has actually happened.\n\n197\n00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.660\nLet me switch on over to another machine.\n\n198\n00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.840\nClient CL2, this is where I have those\nremote server administrator tools.\n\n199\n00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.510\nIf I click on the Windows button,\n\n200\n00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:41.400\nscroll down to the W's and\ngo down to Windows Administration Tools.\n\n201\n00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.900\nI should now look for organization,\n\n202\n00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.820\nwhere should I find organizational units,\nCherokee?\n\n203\n00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.030\nWhere in the world would I find those?\n\n204\n00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.790\nWould that be in-\n&gt;&gt; Active Directory?\n\n205\n00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:52.590\n&gt;&gt; In Active Directory,\nusers and computers?\n\n206\n00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:59.030\n&gt;&gt; You can create users and computers and\nthen add them to organizational units but\n\n207\n00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.700\nI don't know if that's where\nyou want to navigate to.\n\n208\n00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:01.275\n&gt;&gt; Let's see.\n\n209\n00:12:01.275 --> 00:12:07.470\n[LAUGH] Let's see if I can\nactually bring this thing up.\n\n210\n00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.092\nIf I can type in the password correctly.\n\n211\n00:12:11.693 --> 00:12:14.385\nJust trying to remember this password,\nit's insane.\n\n212\n00:12:20.462 --> 00:12:21.760\nLet's see here.\n\n213\n00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.112\nWhere would it actually be?\n\n214\n00:12:24.112 --> 00:12:24.620\nLook at that.\n\n215\n00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.060\nYou were right, there it is.\n\n216\n00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.460\nAll right, so here it is.\n\n217\n00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.400\nWe actually did see and\nCherokee was right.\n\n218\n00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.850\nThe GNV was actually\ncreated right there and so\n\n219\n00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.590\nnow you see the organizational\nunit it is ready to go.\n\n220\n00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.385\nWell, we also need to\nbe able to delete this.\n\n221\n00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:45.924\nAnd so sometimes I don't know\nabout deleting it too much.\n\n222\n00:12:45.924 --> 00:12:50.753\nBecause remember that there may be objects\nthat are in here and if you delete it,\n\n223\n00:12:50.753 --> 00:12:54.700\nit can cause issues and\nproblems that may end up arising.\n\n224\n00:12:54.700 --> 00:13:00.250\nSo simply you right-click and\nthen notice that you can go to Delete.\n\n225\n00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:04.540\nNow, that's doesn't seem to be\nanything really challenging.\n\n226\n00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.250\nSo I'm not so worried about here.\n\n227\n00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.470\nBut as I scroll back and\nI come back over here.\n\n228\n00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.183\nTo make things a little bit\nmore administratively easy,\n\n229\n00:13:12.183 --> 00:13:14.625\nI realized that I was logged\nin as the wrong person.\n\n230\n00:13:14.625 --> 00:13:17.680\nThat's why I kept getting\nthose credentials being asked.\n\n231\n00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.200\nI had logged off and\nlogged back in as Joey.\n\n232\n00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.620\nSo here's that organizational\nunit that we had created,\n\n233\n00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.180\nthe last thing that\nended up happening here.\n\n234\n00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.700\nNow, the other thing that we have to do,\nis from here.\n\n235\n00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:34.800\nIf I now type in\nRemove-ADorganizaitonal unit,\n\n236\n00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.677\nat least I think so.\n\n237\n00:13:37.677 --> 00:13:42.453\nThen I do Identity here, well,\nI can't just type in GNV,\n\n238\n00:13:42.453 --> 00:13:47.840\nit's gonna require me use that\ndistinguished name instead.\n\n239\n00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.270\nAnd this is why people get a little bit\nmore worried about PowerShell, right?\n\n240\n00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:59.256\nBecause it does require just\na little bit more here,\n\n241\n00:13:59.256 --> 00:14:04.882\nso I need to do OU-GNV then I do a comma\n\n242\n00:14:04.882 --> 00:14:11.740\nDC=Officeprodemoco another comma DC.\n\n243\n00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:18.330\nSo each name inside of between the dots\nis essentially what we're doing.\n\n244\n00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:23.616\nSo that would be on, Microsoft, and\n\n245\n00:14:23.616 --> 00:14:28.911\nthen, another comma, DC, comma.\n\n246\n00:14:28.911 --> 00:14:32.650\nAll right,\nclose out of the parentheses there.\n\n247\n00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:37.090\nAnd I'm gonna do a,\nconfirm: and then false,\n\n248\n00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:42.190\nI don't really want it to\ngive me any warning at all.\n\n249\n00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:45.510\nNow, before I do that I'm gonna make\nsure I spelled false correctly cuz it\n\n250\n00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.340\ndoesn't look like I did.\n\n251\n00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.190\nBut let me trust that it did that here.\n\n252\n00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.810\nYeah, all right, so there we go, okay.\n\n253\n00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.610\nNow at the end, if I go ahead and\npress Enter here,\n\n254\n00:14:55.610 --> 00:15:00.710\nI'm going to get red all over my screen,\nand there's a reason why.\n\n255\n00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.270\nIf I go back over here just for\na moment, and\n\n256\n00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:07.210\nremember I told you that there was\nnothing really to concern yourself about.\n\n257\n00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.000\nIf you just wanna delete it,\nyou simply right-click, and\n\n258\n00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.840\nyou go to Delete, right here.\n\n259\n00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.991\nIf I hit Delete, it says, hey,\nare you sure you want to delete this?\n\n260\n00:15:15.991 --> 00:15:17.950\nAnd all I have to do is hit Yes.\n\n261\n00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.420\nBut watch what happens when I do this,\nCherokee.\n\n262\n00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.500\nIt tells me something right here, okay?\n\n263\n00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.920\nYou don't have sufficient\nprivileges to delete this object.\n\n264\n00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.810\nIt's protected from,\nlook at that Cherokee.\n\n265\n00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:30.670\n&gt;&gt; Accidental deletion.\n\n266\n00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.620\n&gt;&gt; Accidental deletion.\n\n267\n00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:38.320\nSo by default when I created this,\nwithout anything else, without any other\n\n268\n00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.490\noptions that I had there, it automatically\nprotected it from accidental deletion.\n\n269\n00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:45.900\nBecause just like I was saying,\nif you delete objects accidentally and\n\n270\n00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.780\nyou don't realize there's something in it,\nit can cause issues.\n\n271\n00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.824\nSo it is here that I\ncan now add in another.\n\n272\n00:15:52.824 --> 00:15:56.862\n&gt;&gt; Which is pretty smart on Microsoft's\nbehalf because if, for instance,\n\n273\n00:15:56.862 --> 00:15:59.018\nI accidentally deleted users Ronnie.\n\n274\n00:15:59.018 --> 00:16:00.458\nIt's impossible for\n\n275\n00:16:00.458 --> 00:16:05.410\nme to recreate the security identifiers\nassociated with that account.\n\n276\n00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:09.830\nAnd I could potentially permanently\nlose access to certain components.\n\n277\n00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.244\n&gt;&gt; Right, so let's see if I can do this.\n\n278\n00:16:12.244 --> 00:16:15.273\n-ProtectedFromAccidental.\n\n279\n00:16:15.273 --> 00:16:22.610\nActually, I need to do something\nbefore I type in that entire command.\n\n280\n00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:26.080\nI need to now set that because I was\nabout to type in the whole thing,\n\n281\n00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.670\nand that would have been really bad for\nme to do this.\n\n282\n00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.866\nI'm about to do it wrong.\n\n283\n00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:39.342\nSo I need to -Set\nADOrganizationalUnit -Name GNV.\n\n284\n00:16:39.342 --> 00:16:44.421\nAnd then do\nthe -ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion.\n\n285\n00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:50.860\nHere I would do a $False\nto be able to do this.\n\n286\n00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.830\nIt doesn't like the name.\n\n287\n00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.950\nSo, if I were to do this, it's actually\nrequiring me to do the identity.\n\n288\n00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.940\nSo this is where you have to\ndo that whole identity again.\n\n289\n00:17:06.142 --> 00:17:15.991\n=GNV, DC=Officeprodemoco,DC=\n\n290\n00:17:15.991 --> 00:17:21.259\nonmicrosoft,DC.\n\n291\n00:17:21.259 --> 00:17:24.920\nSo, you can see why some\npeople don't really like\n\n292\n00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.771\nthe PowerShell cuz I'm starting\nto not appreciate it myself.\n\n293\n00:17:27.771 --> 00:17:29.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At this particular point.\n\n294\n00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.696\n&gt;&gt; It is a lot of typing Ronnie.\n\n295\n00:17:30.696 --> 00:17:33.935\n&gt;&gt; It is a lot of typing.\n\n296\n00:17:33.935 --> 00:17:41.260\n-ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion $false\nhere.\n\n297\n00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:48.260\nAnd now that I have it set like this,\nnow I can go back and see if, there we go,\n\n298\n00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:54.860\ncuz now I gotta change this\nup using that same command.\n\n299\n00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.620\nBut now I simply type\nremove if I can do remove.\n\n300\n00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:01.980\nOrganization unit the identity.\n\n301\n00:18:04.587 --> 00:18:08.217\nI'm gonna get rid of the protected here.\n\n302\n00:18:08.217 --> 00:18:10.060\nAnd now do a confirm.\n\n303\n00:18:14.406 --> 00:18:21.310\nColon, make sure I'm doing this\nright here, equals false, right?\n\n304\n00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:21.970\nYep.\n\n305\n00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.480\nDollar sign, false.\n\n306\n00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.860\n&gt;&gt; So, you're just omitting or\n\n307\n00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.470\nbypassing that confirmation\nnotification that would pop up?\n\n308\n00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.950\n&gt;&gt; Right, at least,\nthat's what I'm hoping I'm doing here.\n\n309\n00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:34.590\nSo, now that I've removed\nthe accidental protection here,\n\n310\n00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.200\nnotice that it gives that.\n\n311\n00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.420\nAnd now, we actually have it open,\nand we are ready to go.\n\n312\n00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.110\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie.\n\n313\n00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.110\nI didn't see any kind\nof notification there.\n\n314\n00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.310\nSo, is there any way we can go back and\ncheck our work?\n\n315\n00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n316\n00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:50.670\nSo, that's one of the benefits of actually\nbeing able to add in that confirmation.\n\n317\n00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.200\nSaying, yes,\nlet's verify that everything is done.\n\n318\n00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.600\nBut, if we wanted to see this,\nit's just get-adorganizational,\n\n319\n00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.980\nIf I can spell organizational unit.\n\n320\n00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:05.210\nOnce we have that, I'm gonna filter\neverything to well, everything.\n\n321\n00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:09.100\nThen I'm gonna just format it as\na table list is what I'm going to do.\n\n322\n00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.380\nSo from here,\nyou can see under distinguished name,\n\n323\n00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:17.570\nnotice that there's nothing actually\nwith GNV listed in it at all.\n\n324\n00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.910\nThe other things are still here and\nwhat we have available to us.\n\n325\n00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.020\nBut it gives us that chance\nto be able to delete that.\n\n326\n00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.540\nSo the great thing is if you\nset it through the GUI, through\n\n327\n00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:32.040\nthe Graphical User Interface, it's just\na simple check box when you create it.\n\n328\n00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.387\nWhether you want to add in the accidental\ndeletion protection or not,\n\n329\n00:19:36.387 --> 00:19:39.048\nif you do,\nthen you simply add it in there.\n\n330\n00:19:39.048 --> 00:19:43.404\nWith the PowerShell and the way that we\ndid without any other additional options,\n\n331\n00:19:43.404 --> 00:19:45.614\nsuch as doing it where\nI told it to be true,\n\n332\n00:19:45.614 --> 00:19:49.930\nunder the protection of the accidental\ndeletion, it went in and set it anyways.\n\n333\n00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:53.720\nSo, those are some of the things that\nyou may actually choose to look out for.\n\n334\n00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.700\nBut either way,\nthat should at least help you get started\n\n335\n00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:01.190\nin setting up an organization unit,\nas well as deleting it too.\n\n336\n00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:05.610\nAnd that should be pretty much enough\nto get you a little bit more familiar.\n\n337\n00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:09.030\nNow in terms of the organization and\nthe way that you do it,\n\n338\n00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:12.410\nin other words the planning and the\nstructure of all that, that's when you do\n\n339\n00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:18.490\ndive into the realm of where those classes\ncome in, right, for the MCSA or MCSE.\n\n340\n00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:21.420\nThat's where you actually end up\nseeing more of that on how to make\n\n341\n00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.900\nsure that those are organized.\n\n342\n00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.430\nWe just simply created them, we showed\nyou of course how to delete them, and\n\n343\n00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:30.130\nwhat are some of the things that you\ncan do in PowerShell as well as a GUI.\n\n344\n00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:32.090\n&gt;&gt; Our work's not finished yet\nthough, Ronnie.\n\n345\n00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:35.100\nWe still have to,\nwe've created this organization unit, but\n\n346\n00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.530\nthen what are we gonna put in\nthose organizational units?\n\n347\n00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.810\nWell ladies and gentlemen stay tuned\nbecause when you come back we'll\n\n348\n00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:44.470\nbe looking at creating those\nuser accounts with Ronnie.\n\n349\n00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:48.660\nAnd also taking a look at what we can\ndo with these organizational units.\n\n350\n00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.748\nBut for this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n351\n00:20:50.748 --> 00:20:52.206\nRemember I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n352\n00:20:52.206 --> 00:20:53.180\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n353\n00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.958\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITProTV.\n\n354\n00:20:54.958

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.423 --> 00:00:14.480\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Server 101 series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.450\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.240\nIn this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.130\nwe'll be taking a look at how to create\nuser accounts within Active Directory.\n\n8\n00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.750\nWith us today back in studios\nwe have Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.390\nThanks for joining us today Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.840\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back\nas we continue to take a look at some\n\n11\n00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.320\nActive Directory skills that we need\nto develop right here in Server 101.\n\n12\n00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.780\nJust to get us familiar with working\ninside of Active Directory a little bit\n\n13\n00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.090\nmore, one of the key things that we'll\nactually have to do on the routine basis\n\n14\n00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.360\nof course is to be able to create user\naccounts inside of Active Directory.\n\n15\n00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.769\nSo, we're gonna show you of course how to\ndo that not only using the graphical user\n\n16\n00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.740\ninterface tools that are available, but\n\n17\n00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.290\nalso PowerShell because that's the way\nthat the future's actually going.\n\n18\n00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.390\nSo that's where we want to\nactually take the step and\n\n19\n00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.080\nmake sure that we understand that\nthat's what's gonna have to happen.\n\n20\n00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.410\nSo this is one of the more\ncommon things that we'll do.\n\n21\n00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.270\nIt's a fairly routine task but\nit is something that\n\n22\n00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.460\nwe need to make sure that we understand\nwhat we're doing and how to do it, okay?\n\n23\n00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.840\nSo, when we start to take a look at that,\n\n24\n00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.320\nwe have to ask that very\nobvious question then, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.690\nWhy in the world do we need to be\nable to do something like this?\n\n26\n00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.550\nWell, remember that as your company\ncontinues to grow, continues to actually\n\n27\n00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.600\nchange, more than likely you'll see\nthat you'll be adding user accounts in.\n\n28\n00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.740\nAnd that means somebody has\nto be able to create them.\n\n29\n00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.250\nAnd if you're wondering why\nwell one is simple onboarding.\n\n30\n00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.830\nThe very fact that new users are going\nto be hired inside of your company\n\n31\n00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.340\nmeans that those accounts\nhave to be created.\n\n32\n00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.530\nNow if you're like does that mean I\nhave to start watching everybody that's\n\n33\n00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.650\nhired and then I go in and create that?\n\n34\n00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.580\nMore than likely not, right?\n\n35\n00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.740\nUsually what ends up happening\nis that your HR department will\n\n36\n00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.210\nprobably end up with a list of names if\nyou hire more than one person at a time.\n\n37\n00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.300\nThen they'll send you a list or\nif it actually is just a single hire,\n\n38\n00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.790\nthey'll send you\nthe information that you need.\n\n39\n00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.580\nBut the clear aspect of what\nwe need to do of course,\n\n40\n00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.260\nis to make sure that we understand that,\nhey, this is what's gonna happen and\n\n41\n00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.160\nhere's the information that you'll\nneed to have ready to go to do that.\n\n42\n00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.440\nThe other one of course\nare special use cases.\n\n43\n00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.020\nFor example, it may be a contracting\nbasis where somebody's coming in to\n\n44\n00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.960\nyour organization for a bit of time and,\nsince they're gonna be there,\n\n45\n00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.320\nthey're gonna need access to\nsome of the network resources.\n\n46\n00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.490\nBut you might want to create an account,\nand\n\n47\n00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.670\nthen have them disabled after\na period of time as well.\n\n48\n00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.230\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, that's an interesting\nchoice of word that you just\n\n49\n00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.710\nused there when you said disabled.\n\n50\n00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.280\nI've been in organizations that didn't\nreally have a good solid understanding of\n\n51\n00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.510\nhaving a policy in place for those\ncontractual-based or temporary type users.\n\n52\n00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.610\nSo, why is that important do disable\nan account rather than going ahead and\n\n53\n00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.030\njust deleting that user?\n\n54\n00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.674\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's a lot of things that will\nend up going on especially when we start\n\n55\n00:02:52.674 --> 00:02:54.267\ntalking about that idea of disabling,\nright?\n\n56\n00:02:54.267 --> 00:02:58.554\nThe very fact is that the user might\nhave access to some information and,\n\n57\n00:02:58.554 --> 00:03:03.267\neven after they leave the organization,\nthat account may still be valuable and\n\n58\n00:03:03.267 --> 00:03:06.040\ntied to the information that's there.\n\n59\n00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.230\nWe wanna make sure that we can\naccess the information that's\n\n60\n00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.300\ntied to that account if we need to.\n\n61\n00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.060\nIf you delete it right away, you may also\nend up deleting whatever's been encrypted.\n\n62\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.670\nSo it's not really a good policy.\n\n63\n00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.330\nNormally we talk about this\nidea of disabling it and\n\n64\n00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330\nallowing it to sit there for a while and\nmake sure that we can access everything\n\n65\n00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.080\nthat we need to before going to some other\npermanent basis of doing what we need to.\n\n66\n00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.930\nSo when it comes down to\nthe idea of creating this,\n\n67\n00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.630\nit's not really a difficult process but it\nis something that if you are told you need\n\n68\n00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.900\nto create a user account for somebody,\nyou've got to know how to do that.\n\n69\n00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.010\nSo the simplest way to get started here,\nokay?\n\n70\n00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.690\nNow, if we do this is to remember\nthat first of all you do have to\n\n71\n00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.170\nplan a little bit or somebody has to give\nyou guidelines to be able to do this.\n\n72\n00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.280\nSo that means that you need to get the\ninformation that you're expected to get\n\n73\n00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.630\nfor that user account to be created.\n\n74\n00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.670\nSome organizations may just say look all\nyou need is a username, first name, and\n\n75\n00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.540\nlast name and that's pretty much it.\n\n76\n00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.458\nYou'll set the rest on your own.\n\n77\n00:04:04.458 --> 00:04:07.880\nFor example, if you're gonna create\nan account for them, you may go ahead and\n\n78\n00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.470\njust have a standard password\nthat you give to everybody.\n\n79\n00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.310\nAnd you just select that\noption to make sure\n\n80\n00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.390\nthat on the first time they login to\nchange whatever the password may be.\n\n81\n00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.310\nSo in other words, you may have\na chance to actually get a part of that\n\n82\n00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.930\nwhere you're actually making it.\n\n83\n00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.000\nBut the other information such as\nwhat department that they're in and\n\n84\n00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.340\njob description that's\nall actually part of it,\n\n85\n00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.030\nyou need to make sure that that's\non hand first when you do so, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.150\nThen you also have to be able\nto create the account and\n\n87\n00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.520\nonce you create the account it\ndoesn't mean that you're done.\n\n88\n00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.530\nYou need to make sure that it can be\ntested and verified that it's gonna work\n\n89\n00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.920\nand it is actually gonna be\nlocated where you want it to be.\n\n90\n00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.440\nSo those are some of the different things\nthat we want to consider when we start\n\n91\n00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.510\ncreating these types of accounts for\nour active directory.\n\n92\n00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.260\nInside of active directory then, as we\nbegin, we of course want to show you.\n\n93\n00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.090\nThis is kind of the first way\nthat I actually learned to do it,\n\n94\n00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.600\nwas by using the active\ndirectory users and computers.\n\n95\n00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.070\nThat's probably the easiest one,\n\n96\n00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.130\nprobably the one that most people end of\ngoing to if you started learning this too.\n\n97\n00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.830\nNow when you start to do this,\nremember that we did\n\n98\n00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.050\na warning to you about going directly\nto the domain controller itself.\n\n99\n00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.270\nSo you may think now that I have access\nto being able to create user accounts,\n\n100\n00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.460\nI should be able to log directly\ninto the domain controller and\n\n101\n00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.680\nbe able to create user accounts there, but\n\n102\n00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.620\nCherokee remind us again who can\nlogin to domain controllers.\n\n103\n00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.040\n&gt;&gt; So we're talking about administrators,\neither the local admin for\n\n104\n00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.660\nthat server or a domain admin.\n\n105\n00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.010\nAnd you really need to login\nto that domain controller.\n\n106\n00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.690\nWhenever we have the concept of a\nmultimaster replication within our domain.\n\n107\n00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.990\nI could even login remotely,\nas long as I have access to that\n\n108\n00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.650\nActive Directory utility,\nthose management tools.\n\n109\n00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthat's one of the things, right?\n\n110\n00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.870\nIf we're trying to do this remotely,\nwe may find out very quickly,\n\n111\n00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.810\nespecially if I'm a junior administrator,\nI'm not gonna be a domain admin, so\n\n112\n00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.220\ncan I still create user accounts or not?\n\n113\n00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.690\nWell yeah, you definitely can if you're\nassigned those privileges to be able\n\n114\n00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:11.730\nto do so.\n\n115\n00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.530\nBut just because you are, doesn't mean you\ncan go directly to the domain controller.\n\n116\n00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.670\nSo we also talked about\nthis in a previous episode\n\n117\n00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.920\nthat we're gonna be using remote\nmanagement tools a majority of the time.\n\n118\n00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.530\nAnd that is a best practice for us to make\nsure that we understand what we're doing.\n\n119\n00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.930\nSo lets go to my machine here and\nwill go ahead and\n\n120\n00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.230\nshow you what we're talking about, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.510\nRemember that, here it is, you can't\nreally tell just by me pointing out,\n\n122\n00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.860\nbut you'll have to trust me on this.\n\n123\n00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.120\nI'm on a Windows 10 machine here and\n\n124\n00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.200\nthis Windows 10 machine is,\nlets say, my particular computer.\n\n125\n00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.806\nAnd when you start to do some\ntype of management like this,\n\n126\n00:06:43.806 --> 00:06:47.317\nnormally the best practice in terms of\nadministration right, is that you have\n\n127\n00:06:47.317 --> 00:06:50.746\na standard user account for everything\nelse that you're gonna log in to do.\n\n128\n00:06:50.746 --> 00:06:54.218\nAll the other daily work that you\ndo such as checking email and\n\n129\n00:06:54.218 --> 00:06:58.713\nkeeping access to your ticketing system\nand doing all the other things that you\n\n130\n00:06:58.713 --> 00:07:02.184\nneed to do on a daily basis as you\nsurf the internet and look for\n\n131\n00:07:02.184 --> 00:07:05.070\nkitten videos on YouTube,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n132\n00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.480\nCat videos on YouTube.\n\n133\n00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.140\nWhatever it might be, right,\nas you do that, you log in with that.\n\n134\n00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.080\nBut now let's say you got\na ticket in from HR that says,\n\n135\n00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.660\nhey, we need details of\nyour accounts created.\n\n136\n00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.620\nWell, the best practice\nrecommendation is that you log off and\n\n137\n00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.750\nyou log back in with the credentials that\nyou need to, to give you essentially that\n\n138\n00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.260\nadministrative type of\naccess that you need.\n\n139\n00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.450\nNow, I've already done that,\nI'm logged in as Joey here.\n\n140\n00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.090\nWho's actually a domain administrator but\n\n141\n00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.510\ninstead, when I do that,\nright, then now it sets me up.\n\n142\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.350\nAnd I have installed on here\nthe remote administration tools,\n\n143\n00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.230\nthe remote server administration tools for\nWindows 10.\n\n144\n00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:50.550\nSo if I click on the start button and\nthen I scroll down in my Start menu,\n\n145\n00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.770\nall the way down to the administrative\ntools here, Windows administrative tools.\n\n146\n00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.252\nI can select this and here it is.\n\n147\n00:07:57.252 --> 00:08:00.013\nIt's Active Directory Users and Computers.\n\n148\n00:08:00.013 --> 00:08:03.294\nThat's the one that I'm going\nto select and launch from there.\n\n149\n00:08:03.294 --> 00:08:05.412\nWhen I do so,\nit may ask me for credentials.\n\n150\n00:08:05.412 --> 00:08:09.653\nI've already launched that up so that we\ncould get here a little bit easier and\n\n151\n00:08:09.653 --> 00:08:11.762\nquicker to be able to see some things.\n\n152\n00:08:11.762 --> 00:08:14.060\nAnd you can see there's my domain name and\n\n153\n00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.550\nit shows me that I am connected into\nmy domain controller, right here.\n\n154\n00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.086\nFrom here I can expand out the domain.\n\n155\n00:08:22.086 --> 00:08:26.669\nI can also expand that,\nlet's say Office 365 OU down here,\n\n156\n00:08:26.669 --> 00:08:30.040\nthe administrative OU that we have.\n\n157\n00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:36.130\nOnce I select that, if I wanted to I\ncould create a new OU very quickly.\n\n158\n00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.400\nAnd let's do this by location this time.\n\n159\n00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.310\nI'm just gonna select NYC, and here it is.\n\n160\n00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:46.520\nHere's something that kind of got me in,\nlet me make sure I'm actually, okay,\n\n161\n00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.210\nmy cursor locked up there for a moment.\n\n162\n00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:50.560\nRemember here's that check mark.\n\n163\n00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.420\nProtect container from\naccidental deletion.\n\n164\n00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.590\nSo if you wanna make sure,\nI don't want to for\n\n165\n00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.250\nright now, so\nI'm going to uncheck that button.\n\n166\n00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.870\nUsually we'll probably leave it\ndone that way cuz it's the default.\n\n167\n00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.570\nWe click OK, and there it is.\n\n168\n00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.980\nI have created a new OU,\nan organizational unit for me.\n\n169\n00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.170\nSo I can now create a new\nuser account right here.\n\n170\n00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:19.360\nI'm simply gonna right-click\non the NYC OU &gt; New &gt; User.\n\n171\n00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.510\nAnd it is right here that we can\nwalk through some of the information\n\n172\n00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.660\nas we create this new object\nthat's called a user.\n\n173\n00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.160\nAnd I'm going to create a name here, okay?\n\n174\n00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.880\nSo if I actually try to\ncreate a name right now,\n\n175\n00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.870\nlet's see who are we going to do?\n\n176\n00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.500\nLet's do another one here.\n\n177\n00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.760\nSo we'll pick some Star Wars\nname this time is what we'll do.\n\n178\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.063\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, this is gonna be that\ndefault form but you can customize this if\n\n179\n00:09:44.063 --> 00:09:47.275\nyou have specific attributes\nthat you wanna go ahead and\n\n180\n00:09:47.275 --> 00:09:52.152\ninput into Active Directory, but this is\nnormally what you'll be looking at here.\n\n181\n00:09:52.152 --> 00:09:54.067\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at least from this standpoint,\n\n182\n00:09:54.067 --> 00:09:57.390\nI didn't do anything specific\nto get us to this point here.\n\n183\n00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.920\nWe're just creating the basic account,\nand notice it's really asking me for\n\n184\n00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.550\nwhat we call a first name and a last name.\n\n185\n00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:08.020\nAnd then the full name on this account,\nand then, of course, a login here.\n\n186\n00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:12.920\nSo I'm just gonna do Landu cuz I know\nI think on everything else that I did\n\n187\n00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.570\nright here, I actually did\nthe first initial last name.\n\n188\n00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:20.990\nI can't even tell you that I spelled\nCalrycian right, so I'm gonna try anyways.\n\n189\n00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:26.780\nCalrycian here,\nI probably didn't spell that right,\n\n190\n00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.120\nbut we'll go with it for right now.\n\n191\n00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:29.770\nClick Next.\n\n192\n00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.160\nAnd now it's asking me for a password.\n\n193\n00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.876\nThe only thing I'm going to do is make\nsure that this first one is checked cuz I\n\n194\n00:10:35.876 --> 00:10:38.916\nreally don't need to keep\nsomebody else's password for us.\n\n195\n00:10:42.925 --> 00:10:46.210\nAnd I'm using my super-secret password,\nof course.\n\n196\n00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.190\nAt least I think I am, or\nI'm not typing in the same password twice.\n\n197\n00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.850\nSo what I'm going to do\nis I'm gonna leave that.\n\n198\n00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.410\nNow of course, if you're\nactually the one setting this up,\n\n199\n00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:00.420\nmake sure you follow whatever\nthe security policy is for this.\n\n200\n00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.100\nUsually this is probably the big one here,\n\n201\n00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.350\nespecially if you're going to be creating\na lot of accounts, to make sure that users\n\n202\n00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.770\ndo change password from whatever\nthis default one is gonna be.\n\n203\n00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.180\nYou can make it where the user's\nnot gonna change the password.\n\n204\n00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.189\nThat's probably not for\nthis type of account.\n\n205\n00:11:13.189 --> 00:11:14.530\nPassword never expires.\n\n206\n00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.450\nNot really a good thing for\nregular user as well, and\n\n207\n00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.165\nthen you can even start\nwith the account disabled.\n\n208\n00:11:20.165 --> 00:11:23.480\nBut all those are actually features that\nyou can choose to do if you want to.\n\n209\n00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nwe know this isn't an A plus class.\n\n210\n00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.560\nWe're not gonna go through all the\ndifferent iterations of what you should\n\n211\n00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.600\nand should not have set for a password.\n\n212\n00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.760\nBut it is very important that when\nyou are creating these accounts in\n\n213\n00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.720\nActive Directory, you never wanna\ngo ahead and choose a password for\n\n214\n00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.470\nsomeone or be there with them and\nseeing their password.\n\n215\n00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.355\nYou just don't want the IT department\nto have that liability there.\n\n216\n00:11:42.355 --> 00:11:44.580\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really isn't helpful, right?\n\n217\n00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.320\nThe very fact is we want it to be secret.\n\n218\n00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.330\nWe want the user to feel like that\nthey've set up their own password\n\n219\n00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.650\nwithout us having it.\n\n220\n00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:55.590\nBut at the same time here, by letting\nthem change it on their first login,\n\n221\n00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.930\nthat's probably a good thing for\nthem to do.\n\n222\n00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.740\nMore than likely you don't wanna change\nany of the defaults that we have,\n\n223\n00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.160\nsuch as making a complex password, but\n\n224\n00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.398\njust make sure that you follow whatever\nthe security policies are gonna be.\n\n225\n00:12:07.398 --> 00:12:11.020\nWe're simply gonna click Next,\nwhich I don't know why it's hard for\n\n226\n00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.310\nme to say this morning.\n\n227\n00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.140\nFrom that point, I'm gonna verify that\neverything is summarized in the way that I\n\n228\n00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.600\nexpect it to be.\n\n229\n00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.000\nAnd you do wanna read through this.\n\n230\n00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.490\nIt's easy to kind of, gosh, who cares.\n\n231\n00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:26.940\nBut make sure this is saying what you\nexpect it to say, because if it doesn't,\n\n232\n00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.140\nyou can create it and then you have\nto go back and modify it again.\n\n233\n00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:33.050\nAnd that doesn't sound bad, I mean\nwith one account, what's the big deal?\n\n234\n00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:37.320\nWell, now if you change it to 50 accounts\nor 100 accounts that you're adding\n\n235\n00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.820\nat a time, now it begins to\nactually be a little bit more, and\n\n236\n00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.800\nsomething that you don't really want\nto end up happening is the key.\n\n237\n00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.691\nSo let me go ahead and click Finish.\n\n238\n00:12:50.278 --> 00:12:52.400\nAnd now there it is.\n\n239\n00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:57.330\nLando is now actually created and\nthat's kind of a very simple way for\n\n240\n00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.460\nus to do something like this.\n\n241\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.146\nAnd by far, it's probably the one\nthat most of us are gonna get\n\n242\n00:13:01.146 --> 00:13:01.772\nintroduced to first.\n\n243\n00:13:01.772 --> 00:13:02.895\n&gt;&gt; Most common, yep.\n\n244\n00:13:02.895 --> 00:13:04.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in doing this.\n\n245\n00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.260\nSo as long as actually using that\nremote administration tools,\n\n246\n00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.680\nyou're pretty much fine and\nyou're actually ready to go here.\n\n247\n00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.820\nNow of course, that means that if\nwe can do this inside of using\n\n248\n00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:21.120\nthe remote server administration tools, it\nalso means we have to get ready to do this\n\n249\n00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:26.150\nin PowerShell as well and that's\nsomething we also want to take a look at.\n\n250\n00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:30.860\nFrom right here we are now ready to\ncreate user accounts as we do this.\n\n251\n00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:35.730\nSo since I'm actually logged in as Joey\nalready, I'm actually able to just simply\n\n252\n00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:39.850\nstart typing in the commands that I\nneed to because I am a domain admin.\n\n253\n00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.670\nI can go ahead and\nuse the tools that are actually there.\n\n254\n00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.920\nNow we did have in our chat,\n\n255\n00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.510\nwhich is something good to be reminded of,\nCherokee, something I do forget.\n\n256\n00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.219\nOne of the best ways, instead of the way\nthat I did it, which is simply to login\n\n257\n00:13:52.219 --> 00:13:55.721\nas whoever I need to and create that\nseparate account, is use the runas.\n\n258\n00:13:55.721 --> 00:13:58.240\nAnd that's actually been true for\na long time.\n\n259\n00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.570\nSo it actually does let everybody know\nhow old I am is what it really does\n\n260\n00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.120\nwhen you start doing this.\n\n261\n00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.300\nSo if you right-click, a lot of\ntimes you can select runas instead.\n\n262\n00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.740\nAnd that allows you to do that\nadministrative access that you need to and\n\n263\n00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.600\nbe ready to go.\n\n264\n00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.320\n&gt;&gt; And that's fine,\n\n265\n00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.293\nbecause we don't wanna be running at that\nhigher escalated privilege all the time.\n\n266\n00:14:18.293 --> 00:14:19.050\n&gt;&gt; All the time.\n\n267\n00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.670\n&gt;&gt; Because that would\njust help us secure and\n\n268\n00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:26.238\nreduce our attack surface if we have to go\nahead and elevate on an as needed basis?\n\n269\n00:14:26.238 --> 00:14:30.310\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and so as soon as you are actually\ndone, you drop out of that prompt.\n\n270\n00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:35.165\nThat keeps everything good and ready to\ngo so just in case someone else says ooh,\n\n271\n00:14:35.165 --> 00:14:37.925\nRonnie's logged in as administrator here.\n\n272\n00:14:37.925 --> 00:14:38.554\nI can run whatever I want to.\n\n273\n00:14:38.554 --> 00:14:40.242\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, it should be fun.\n\n274\n00:14:40.242 --> 00:14:43.975\nUsing the runas would be the better\nway to go than what I just showed you.\n\n275\n00:14:43.975 --> 00:14:47.850\nBut it's just the way that I learned it,\nand it's hard for me to change.\n\n276\n00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.419\nThat's what ends up going on, too.\n\n277\n00:14:49.419 --> 00:14:50.908\nRight, so let's go ahead and\ncreate a new one.\n\n278\n00:14:50.908 --> 00:14:57.148\nSo New-ADUser,\nthen I'm going to do a name and\n\n279\n00:14:57.148 --> 00:15:03.080\nwe're gonna actually pull in Walter Mitty.\n\n280\n00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.920\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna have to\nhelp me with this one.\n\n281\n00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.500\n&gt;&gt; Walter Mitty?\n\n282\n00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You don't know who Walter Mitty is?\n\n283\n00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:14.320\nWalter Mitty is a literary\ncharacter from James Thurber.\n\n284\n00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.150\nSo yeah, The Life of Walter Mitty.\n\n285\n00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.030\nIt's worth reading, it's a short story.\n\n286\n00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.520\nSo let's go ahead and\ncreate Walter Mitty here.\n\n287\n00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.820\nNow when I did this, right, that seems\nmuch simpler than what I just showed you,\n\n288\n00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.680\nCherokee, in using the Active\nDirectory Users and Computers, right?\n\n289\n00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:35.560\nI didn't have to walk through and\nadd in first name, last name.\n\n290\n00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.050\nI didn't have to worry about checking\noff the box of all this other stuff.\n\n291\n00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:44.240\nI didn't even create a fake password or\nI shouldn't say fake, an initial password.\n\n292\n00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.560\nSo Cherokee,\nthis is the way I should do things, right?\n\n293\n00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.400\n&gt;&gt; Well, it seems a little empty,\nif you will.\n\n294\n00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.030\nI've got his name but then what\nabout my username, my email address,\n\n295\n00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.764\nhow do I know all of those things?\n\n296\n00:15:54.764 --> 00:15:56.439\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what happens, right,\n\n297\n00:15:56.439 --> 00:15:59.301\nis when you create something that\nis simple as this, it will work.\n\n298\n00:15:59.301 --> 00:16:01.556\nBut because I didn't add\nin all that other stuff,\n\n299\n00:16:01.556 --> 00:16:04.306\nthere is also something else\nthat happened to this account.\n\n300\n00:16:04.306 --> 00:16:09.610\nWhich is the very fact that now that it's\ncreated, it's gonna be disabled as well.\n\n301\n00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.020\nSo, let's take a look at, on the bottom\nof my screen I'm gonna select on\n\n302\n00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.960\nthe Active Directory users and\ncomputers here.\n\n303\n00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.426\nLet me make sure I just\nrefresh everything before I.\n\n304\n00:16:18.426 --> 00:16:20.200\nWell, how do I refresh here?\n\n305\n00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.350\nWell, actually,\nlet me just click somewhere.\n\n306\n00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:23.007\n&gt;&gt; Might be under action.\n\n307\n00:16:23.007 --> 00:16:25.549\n&gt;&gt; So, it might be under action,\nall right.\n\n308\n00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.140\nThere it is refresh, there we go.\n\n309\n00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.790\nSo, I'm gonna scroll down and\nlook at that, there's Walter Mitty.\n\n310\n00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:35.730\nHe's actually been created here and\nthere's Walter.\n\n311\n00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.310\nAnd I know, it's hard to see,\ncuz I've clicked often.\n\n312\n00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.690\nBut, now, as you can see look at\nthat little down arrow right there.\n\n313\n00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.220\nAnd this is a very secure way\nto create a user account, right?\n\n314\n00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.630\nThe very fact is you're creating user\naccount he's disabled right now.\n\n315\n00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.330\nBut you still have to set it up.\n\n316\n00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.240\nSo, what Cherokee is saying here is,\nyes, the account is created, but\n\n317\n00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.720\nthe very fact is it doesn't mean,\n\n318\n00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.170\nthat I'm done administratively\nworking with this account.\n\n319\n00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.960\nSo, sounds easy enough, but\nit still means, that there's more for\n\n320\n00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.380\nus to be able to need to do if we're\ngonna actually do something like this.\n\n321\n00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:12.890\nSo, as easy as that is, it's kind of half\nway done, just like what you were saying.\n\n322\n00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:18.000\nSo, not always the best thing for us to\nthink about when we start to, do this.\n\n323\n00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.800\nBut let's go in and create it,\nthe way that it should be created.\n\n324\n00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.790\nNow, I'm gonna create another one here,\ninstead, and show you.\n\n325\n00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:28.946\nNormally, if you're gonna do this, this\nis what you would actually do instead,\n\n326\n00:17:28.946 --> 00:17:30.043\nso ADUser this time.\n\n327\n00:17:30.043 --> 00:17:33.170\nWe're gonna pick out something\nfrom more pop history here.\n\n328\n00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.428\nYou know who this guy is, right?\n\n329\n00:17:37.428 --> 00:17:38.280\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n330\n00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.040\nSo, this one you actually know,\nso that was actually good.\n\n331\n00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.360\nThen I can do an account name,\nor account password, excuse me.\n\n332\n00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:51.360\nAs what I want,\nmake sure I'm doing this right.\n\n333\n00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.280\nSo, then this is going\nto be the convert to\n\n334\n00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:01.709\nsecure string, then I set up\nmy super secret password here.\n\n335\n00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.560\nNow, I'm making fun of myself,\nbecause I'm not really that super secret.\n\n336\n00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.690\nDo not use this password, people.\n\n337\n00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:13.340\nMicrosoft has been using this, and some\nvariation on this, for the last 20 years,\n\n338\n00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:18.700\nso don't use this as your kind of default\npassword that you start off with.\n\n339\n00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.160\nBut in our training setting here\nthat we're doing, we'll use it.\n\n340\n00:18:26.471 --> 00:18:27.730\nTell it to force.\n\n341\n00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.980\nClose my parentheses here.\n\n342\n00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:39.929\nAnd when I want it, I want to enable this,\nand I'm gonna set this as being $true.\n\n343\n00:18:39.929 --> 00:18:43.420\nNow, I have to actually\ngive the other part.\n\n344\n00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:48.200\nSo, instead of the first name inside of\nthe PowerShell is called given name here.\n\n345\n00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.180\nAnd I'm assuming,\nhis given name is probably not Marty,\n\n346\n00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.220\nit's probably,\n&gt;&gt; Martin?\n\n347\n00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.050\n&gt;&gt; I'm assuming it's Martin.\n\n348\n00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.470\nThat seems logical to me,\nbut I may be wrong.\n\n349\n00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.893\nThere's probably some Back to\nthe Future fan that's railing.\n\n350\n00:19:01.893 --> 00:19:02.888\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cringing.\n\n351\n00:19:02.888 --> 00:19:05.661\n&gt;&gt; Right now,\nbecause you are messing up the text.\n\n352\n00:19:05.661 --> 00:19:08.921\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You are destroying my text there.\n\n353\n00:19:08.921 --> 00:19:10.713\nThere and then surname.\n\n354\n00:19:14.888 --> 00:19:15.471\nNot surename [LAUGH].\n\n355\n00:19:15.471 --> 00:19:20.960\nLikewise I don't I am going to assume\nthat this is true McFly here as well.\n\n356\n00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:25.540\nSo, at the end of this if I have\ntyped out everything correctly here.\n\n357\n00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.680\nLet's go ahead and do that, and\nthat should have created it.\n\n358\n00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.620\nNow, I can do a get -ADuser here, and\n\n359\n00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:39.420\nlet's go ahead and\nsee if we can do Marty McFly.\n\n360\n00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:46.789\nThen I'm going to pipe\nthis into Select-object.\n\n361\n00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:49.940\nName and there we go.\n\n362\n00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:55.100\nSo, you can see, now, inside that\nactive directory here Marty McFly\n\n363\n00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:00.260\nhas been created, and as I take a look\nat the active directory users and\n\n364\n00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.991\ncomputers, then go down to rename.\n\n365\n00:20:02.991 --> 00:20:07.270\n&gt;&gt; Are we being checking his\nstatus to see if [CROSSTALK].\n\n366\n00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.842\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Disabled.\n\n367\n00:20:07.842 --> 00:20:10.080\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, hopefully we will.\n\n368\n00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.180\nLet me see if I can find him though.\n\n369\n00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:14.720\nLet's see refresh.\n\n370\n00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.440\nI was hoping, there he is.\n\n371\n00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.780\nI was hoping that he would be\nright here and there it is.\n\n372\n00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:26.320\nMarty McFly is actually right\nhere underneath Luke Skywalker.\n\n373\n00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:30.430\nSo, if I double click on him,\nand I go to the account.\n\n374\n00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:35.250\nYou should see where a user is not\nchanging password at next log on, but\n\n375\n00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:40.390\nhe is also enabled, because it's actually\ntelling me to unlock his account,\n\n376\n00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:43.660\nbut it's not locked right now,\nso I'm actually fine with that.\n\n377\n00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:48.200\nSo, there it is, we can actually use\nPowerShell to help us to do this.\n\n378\n00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.720\nNow, Cherokee if you were to do this,\nright?\n\n379\n00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.740\nRight now, I hate to say that.\n\n380\n00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:58.010\nFor me, that's still default to what\nactive directory users and computers.\n\n381\n00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.260\nIf I have 50 names, and\n\n382\n00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.520\nI haven't typed all that in,\nthat's sounds insane, doesn't it?\n\n383\n00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.083\nIt sounds a lot of stuff\nthat you have to do.\n\n384\n00:21:04.083 --> 00:21:06.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, here's the thing, Ronnie.\n\n385\n00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.640\nSo, if I had to do it individually and\nthat aspect.\n\n386\n00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.930\nThen, you have to go with work just well\nfor me and probably opt for that also.\n\n387\n00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:19.030\nBut if I already had that\ninformation typed out,\n\n388\n00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:22.930\nsomeone here had mentioned for our ADSI\nedit tool, or if I had some kind of CSV\n\n389\n00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:26.460\nfile, and all of those names were\nalready in the correct format.\n\n390\n00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:30.118\nI could just plug and chug that into\nPowerShell, and it would save me time,\n\n391\n00:21:30.118 --> 00:21:32.458\nlike if I wanted to\ncreate 500 users at once.\n\n392\n00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:35.990\nSo, I think, it really just\ndepends on your task at hand.\n\n393\n00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true and\nthat's what we wanna get to.\n\n394\n00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.150\nSo, normally, there's a balance of this.\n\n395\n00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:44.320\nAnd you can do it however you want to, of\ncourse, but if you're doing one at a time,\n\n396\n00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.330\nit's just as much work to\ndo it in the AD users and\n\n397\n00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.120\ncomputers as it is to do it by PowerShell.\n\n398\n00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.630\nBut if you do have a lot of names,\nthough, all of a sudden the ADUsers and\n\n399\n00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.890\ncomputers seems to be, what,\nmore iterative of a task.\n\n400\n00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:00.030\nEvery name I'd have to type in,\nand enter and do that.\n\n401\n00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:04.740\nSo, instead PowerShell gives us that way\njust like what Cherokee was talking about\n\n402\n00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.490\nto instead run this, and\nactually have a list of name instead.\n\n403\n00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:13.221\nSo, what I've done is I've created\nthat list inside that CSV file, and\n\n404\n00:22:13.221 --> 00:22:18.667\nI've created a folder here, and I'm gonna\nright click on users and go to Notepad.\n\n405\n00:22:21.414 --> 00:22:24.040\nAnd there we go.\n\n406\n00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:28.240\nSo, here's the normal standard\nformat that we really want,\n\n407\n00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:33.310\nif we wanted to create everything in a\ndefault type of user inside of ADUsers and\n\n408\n00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.380\ncomputers using PowerShell.\n\n409\n00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.690\nSo, we want of course that account name,\nwe want first name, last name,\n\n410\n00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:42.720\ndisplay name, the name,\ndescription and of course a password.\n\n411\n00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:47.180\nThat's gonna be our header row, and then\nI created these two accounts from, sorry,\n\n412\n00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:51.690\nI don't mean to kind of give\neverybody too much action there.\n\n413\n00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.610\nIt's just kinda very sensitive.\n\n414\n00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:58.640\nSo, I've created Jack Reacher and\nJohn Wick at this point, and\n\n415\n00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.782\ngave them the information that\nI wanted to include in here.\n\n416\n00:23:01.782 --> 00:23:05.310\nThe key, of course, is remembering\nwhere that file is gonna be kept.\n\n417\n00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:10.060\nSo, if your HR department has\nsent you a CSV file, or even,\n\n418\n00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:13.830\nlet's say, an Excel spreadsheet,\nyou can convert that to a CSV file, and\n\n419\n00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.710\nyou can use that information\nto help you set everything up.\n\n420\n00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.450\nThe way that you want to\nactually get it set up.\n\n421\n00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:24.850\nSo, now, that I have that, and I've got\nthis particular path located right here.\n\n422\n00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.420\nThat's when I need to make sure that I\nunderstand where that file is located.\n\n423\n00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.320\n&gt;&gt; We can just point back to it.\n\n424\n00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.530\n&gt;&gt; Well, at least somebody can.\n\n425\n00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:32.449\nHopefully I can do this as well.\n\n426\n00:23:32.449 --> 00:23:35.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna clear off this, so\n\n427\n00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.930\nthat I can go up to the top here.\n\n428\n00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:40.740\nAnd this time when we do this,\nwe're gonna actually use this and\n\n429\n00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.420\npipe it into some of the information.\n\n430\n00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:52.225\nSo, here I'm gonna actually do an\nimport-csv then I have to do \\labfiles\\.\n\n431\n00:23:52.225 --> 00:23:56.227\nFrom here users.csv.\n\n432\n00:23:56.227 --> 00:24:01.843\nSo, I am going to tell it to import in\nfrom what you see in that CSV file,\n\n433\n00:24:01.843 --> 00:24:09.778\nand I am piping that in for each Using\nthe fancy brackets here, New-ADuser.\n\n434\n00:24:09.778 --> 00:24:16.890\nOops, too fast on the tab completion here.\n\n435\n00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.935\nThe SAMACCOUNTNAME\n\n436\n00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:34.516\nThen $_SAM-GIVENAME,\n\n437\n00:24:34.516 --> 00:24:42.520\nhopefully, [LAUGH] $_.First.\n\n438\n00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.080\n&gt;&gt; Now as your typing this Ronnie.\n\n439\n00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.091\nIf we think back to they syntax,\n\n440\n00:24:47.091 --> 00:24:51.266\nthe layout of that Notepad file that\nyou just showed us or that CSV.\n\n441\n00:24:51.266 --> 00:24:54.165\nAnd it was separated,\nthe comma separated value, so\n\n442\n00:24:54.165 --> 00:24:57.458\neach one of those values that\nhave been separated by commas.\n\n443\n00:24:57.458 --> 00:25:02.040\nAre gonna be plugged into the different\nparameters that you have set forth here.\n\n444\n00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:06.258\nSo it's kind of just following that\nsequential order of information here.\n\n445\n00:25:06.258 --> 00:25:10.000\n&gt;&gt; It really is it's just making\nsure that I type it in correctly,\n\n446\n00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.760\nis pretty much the key,\nis what we're going to see here.\n\n447\n00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:18.160\nSo all of these dashes are essentially\nrepresenting the same commas or\n\n448\n00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.139\nthe comma separated\nvalues that we're doing.\n\n449\n00:25:24.257 --> 00:25:27.337\nAnd one more or actually two more here.\n\n450\n00:25:27.337 --> 00:25:31.919\nDescription and $_.,\n\n451\n00:25:34.141 --> 00:25:36.489\nDescription.\n\n452\n00:25:36.489 --> 00:25:44.340\nAnd then -AccountPassword and this is\nwhere we have to do that convert to again.\n\n453\n00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:48.874\nConvert to secure string.\n\n454\n00:25:48.874 --> 00:25:51.348\nAt least I hope that's what it's showing,\nsecure string.\n\n455\n00:25:57.115 --> 00:26:01.010\nPut that in the password as plain text.\n\n456\n00:26:04.066 --> 00:26:10.600\nI'm gonna force that and then lastly I'm\ngoing to enable this account as well.\n\n457\n00:26:14.871 --> 00:26:19.091\nNow, if I've typed everything in right it\nshould accept it, now if it haven't its\n\n458\n00:26:19.091 --> 00:26:23.180\ngonna spew red all over my screen is\nwhat we're gonna end up seeing here.\n\n459\n00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:28.046\nBut this gives us that ability right\nnow to see that we can do this.\n\n460\n00:26:28.046 --> 00:26:29.360\nNow this is where it gets faster.\n\n461\n00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.560\nNow you're saying, Ryan,\nit took you forever to type out.\n\n462\n00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.788\nBut the very fact is,\n\n463\n00:26:33.788 --> 00:26:38.638\nif that file, instead of containing two\nnames there was 100 names or 50 names,\n\n464\n00:26:38.638 --> 00:26:42.422\nand it can do it all in this one pass\nthat I'm telling it to do it in.\n\n465\n00:26:42.422 --> 00:26:44.523\nWell now I've created 50 user accounts and\n\n466\n00:26:44.523 --> 00:26:48.015\nif you're doing this by Active Director\nuser computers right click yeah.\n\n467\n00:26:48.015 --> 00:26:50.193\n&gt;&gt; We had our stop watch and\nwe were timing Ronnie for\n\n468\n00:26:50.193 --> 00:26:52.220\nevery user that it took\nhim to create that.\n\n469\n00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.202\nMaybe we should do that go back and\nsee how long.\n\n470\n00:26:53.202 --> 00:26:57.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I know yeah and you might\nstill beat me to tell me the truth.\n\n471\n00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.926\nBut overall this is what has to be done.\n\n472\n00:26:58.926 --> 00:27:02.230\nSo if you're looking at this like\nRonnie I'm not writing that down.\n\n473\n00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:04.146\nMake sure you check out\nBrian Squidagol book.\n\n474\n00:27:04.146 --> 00:27:07.950\nAs well but also the show notes\nthat will come along with that.\n\n475\n00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:11.780\nThat will help you to get the exact\none unless I've typed it incorrectly\n\n476\n00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.780\nthen we'll actually see what\nends up happening here too.\n\n477\n00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:19.167\nSo now here's the moment of truth and\nif it is it's probably for me there it is.\n\n478\n00:27:19.167 --> 00:27:21.790\nIt's actually saying I don't have that and\nI can see why.\n\n479\n00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:25.290\nI misspelled given name in one of them.\n\n480\n00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:28.529\nSo instead I need to go back\nall the way over here and\n\n481\n00:27:28.529 --> 00:27:31.394\nget up into where it says give a name,\noops.\n\n482\n00:27:34.079 --> 00:27:36.804\nSo it's right there next to\nthe word Sam right near my head and\n\n483\n00:27:36.804 --> 00:27:38.690\nit's gonna come there it is.\n\n484\n00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.640\nGiven name is what I need.\n\n485\n00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:45.900\nSo at least in theory that\nshould actually be all.\n\n486\n00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.710\nI think everything else is correct here.\n\n487\n00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:53.269\nSo that's the great think about PowerShell\nif you're wrong it's gonna tell you right\n\n488\n00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:54.030\naway as well.\n\n489\n00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:58.066\nSo there we go this time\nnow as we take a look and\n\n490\n00:27:58.066 --> 00:28:01.522\nwe see this now I have created\nthose different accounts.\n\n491\n00:28:01.522 --> 00:28:06.324\nLet me go back to Active Directory Users\nand Computers here I normally just\n\n492\n00:28:06.324 --> 00:28:11.800\nkinda click off, come back on, but\nRefresh will also end up working for us.\n\n493\n00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:15.408\nAnd now you can see,\nlet me see if I can zoom in right here.\n\n494\n00:28:15.408 --> 00:28:19.120\nThere it is, Jack and John.\n\n495\n00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.830\nAnd notice the description that's\nactually right by their names, too.\n\n496\n00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:27.024\nSo those that follow Jack Reacher,\na literary character as well as a movie\n\n497\n00:28:27.024 --> 00:28:30.893\ncharacter now and then John Wick\nwhich is a movie character I think.\n\n498\n00:28:30.893 --> 00:28:32.491\nI don't think it actually\ncomes from any book.\n\n499\n00:28:32.491 --> 00:28:35.670\nHe's definitely security compliance\nif you watch the movies at all.\n\n500\n00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.410\nSo just kind of realize this too.\n\n501\n00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:39.660\nSo let's check it out here.\n\n502\n00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.870\nNotice that we didn't\nhave to do any of this.\n\n503\n00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:43.257\nIt actually created his general.\n\n504\n00:28:43.257 --> 00:28:45.431\nAnd then here it is in the log in.\n\n505\n00:28:45.431 --> 00:28:48.910\nI thought that I use log in name for\nthat part out.\n\n506\n00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:52.080\nBut you can see where the information\nis now created for him.\n\n507\n00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.170\nAnd there we go.\n\n508\n00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:57.252\nWe now have these accounts and they are\nready, at least for a little bit, right?\n\n509\n00:28:57.252 --> 00:29:02.560\nNow, they are all created in the user\naccount and the user's group so far.\n\n510\n00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.505\nBut overall though,\n\n511\n00:29:03.505 --> 00:29:06.347\nthis is where it begins in this\nparticular process that we have.\n\n512\n00:29:06.347 --> 00:29:11.008\nNow along with this on the account\ncreation, okay, it's not the end because\n\n513\n00:29:11.008 --> 00:29:14.306\njust like I showed you here\non these last two accounts,\n\n514\n00:29:14.306 --> 00:29:18.700\neven though creating the accounts\nthemselves fairly easy.\n\n515\n00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:23.220\nEven with the PowerShell as long\nas it was, again way easier\n\n516\n00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:28.060\nwith 50 user accounts to think rather than\na 100 user accounts in one at a time.\n\n517\n00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.250\nIt still doesn't mean we're done.\n\n518\n00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:32.540\nEven with John's account, you actually\nwhere it didn't have a regular username or\n\n519\n00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.540\nlogin name you have to fix that.\n\n520\n00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.060\nYou still have to actually go through and\n\n521\n00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:39.510\nadd in some other things that has to\nbe there and ready to go as well.\n\n522\n00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.570\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying some\nmanagement is required here?\n\n523\n00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:43.280\n&gt;&gt; Definitely some\nmanagement that's required.\n\n524\n00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.340\nBut Cherokee, once again,\nI have talked way too long.\n\n525\n00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:51.000\nAnd that means I will not be finishing\nthat in this particular part.\n\n526\n00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.716\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie it's okay\nit's not the end of the world.\n\n527\n00:29:52.716 --> 00:29:55.536\nWe can go ahead and break and then\nhave you guys come back to take a look\n\n528\n00:29:55.536 --> 00:29:58.040\nat those management and\nmaintenance utilities as well.\n\n529\n00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.960\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n530\n00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.604\nRemember I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n531\n00:30:01.604 --> 00:30:02.960\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n532\n00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.249\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPROTV.\n\n533\n00:30:05.249 -->

00:00:06.708\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.708 --> 00:00:07.993\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.993 --> 00:00:12.340\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.626\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your Server 101 show.\n\n7\n00:00:14.626 --> 00:00:16.130\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.714\nIn the previous episode, Ronnie came\nin and showed us how to go ahead and\n\n9\n00:00:19.714 --> 00:00:23.183\nconfigure accounts within\nActive Directory and set up those users,\n\n10\n00:00:23.183 --> 00:00:25.920\nboth through the GUI and\nwithin PowerShell.\n\n11\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.530\nIn this show, we're gonna go ahead and\njust kinda continue with that concept, but\n\n12\n00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.790\nwe're gonna be managing and\nmaintaining those accounts.\n\n13\n00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.760\nSo thank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me\nback as we continue on to part two,\n\n15\n00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.660\ntaking a look at creating user accounts.\n\n16\n00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.040\nAnd we're at that part where we did\nshow not only that creation, but\n\n17\n00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.950\nnow we need to be able to modify some of\nthe different things that we actually\n\n18\n00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.820\ncan do inside those user accounts as well.\n\n19\n00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.400\nSo that's where we're\ngonna be jumping into.\n\n20\n00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.290\nOf course, along with everything\nelse that we're doing in the server,\n\n21\n00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.754\nwe'll show it in the GUI interface, inside\nthe graphical user interface as well as\n\n22\n00:00:59.754 --> 00:01:04.040\ninside of PowerShell because learning\none is just no longer enough for us.\n\n23\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.700\nWe have to be able to work in both and\nthe world is pushing more and\n\n24\n00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.840\nmore towards PowerShell.\n\n25\n00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.540\nSo don't neglect it.\n\n26\n00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.430\nIt is kind of the key.\n\n27\n00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.910\nNow what we wanna do is we\nwanna take a look at updating\n\n28\n00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.300\na user account inside of active directory.\n\n29\n00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.880\nSo let's jump to my computer as we\nbegin and we start to take a look here.\n\n30\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.240\nRemember that I'm on CL2 which\nis a client machine, and\n\n31\n00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.500\nI am actually using the remote\nadministration tools available to us.\n\n32\n00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.910\nI forgot to actually launch that up\nafter I closed it from the last show.\n\n33\n00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.850\nSo this is a great place for\n\n34\n00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.630\nus to be reminded on where we\ngo once we have it installed.\n\n35\n00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.520\nWe're gonna click on\nthe Windows Start button and menu.\n\n36\n00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.310\nAnd then once we get here into\nthe Start &gt; Administrative Tools &gt;\n\n37\n00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.030\nActive Directory Users and, not Domains\nand Trusts, but Users and Computers.\n\n38\n00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.280\nI don't know why I was reading that wrong.\n\n39\n00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.329\nI should be prompted for credentials.\n\n40\n00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.639\nAnd then click Yes, and unless I've typed\nthem in incorrectly they should show up\n\n41\n00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:05.830\nand appear something very similar\nto what we see right here.\n\n42\n00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.290\nSo in the previous part one episode, we\ncreated a couple of different accounts for\n\n43\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.130\nus as we went through the show.\n\n44\n00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.780\nSo here's two of them.\n\n45\n00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.040\nOne was Jack and here's John.\n\n46\n00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.890\nThe other one that we also created\nwas Walter Mitty here too.\n\n47\n00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.730\nAnd who else did we create?\n\n48\n00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.450\nWe created Marty.\n\n49\n00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.420\n&gt;&gt; Marty McFly.\n\n50\n00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.750\n&gt;&gt; Marty McFly.\n\n51\n00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.900\nThere's Marty.\n\n52\n00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.090\nMarty McFly right there.\n\n53\n00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.150\nSo we created several\ndifferent accounts for\n\n54\n00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.350\nus, to be able to take\na look at what we're doing.\n\n55\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.400\nSo I'm gonna select one of these\naccounts and let's go ahead and select,\n\n56\n00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.010\nlet's say we'll do it in order here.\n\n57\n00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.210\nSo I selected Walter Mitty.\n\n58\n00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.080\nI think he was the first\naccount I created in part one.\n\n59\n00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.780\nSo here's where we can start\nmodifying some attributes.\n\n60\n00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.500\nSimply by double-clicking the name inside\nof Active Directory Users and Computers.\n\n61\n00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.700\nThat will give you a whole list\nof different properties that you\n\n62\n00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.740\nend up seeing.\n\n63\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.580\nNow this one's a little bit different,\n\n64\n00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.800\nbecause there's actually more listed up\nhere than what we normally see by default.\n\n65\n00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.320\nAnd that's because I've been\nclicking around a little bit and\n\n66\n00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.540\nshowing some things.\n\n67\n00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.380\nSome of the tabs that you may actually\ntake a look at what you're set up and\n\n68\n00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.620\nyou're looking at pressing Ronnie\nthat's a lot more tabs up here,\n\n69\n00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.320\nthan what ends up happening.\n\n70\n00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.226\nAnd that is because I went up\nto View &gt; Advance Features.\n\n71\n00:03:19.226 --> 00:03:23.940\nIf I unchecked that, this is more than\nlikely what you'll end up seeing instead.\n\n72\n00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.985\nAt least I think that's\nwhat you'll end up seeing.\n\n73\n00:03:26.985 --> 00:03:29.190\nCuz now you'll see,\nactually it's about the same, so\n\n74\n00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.480\napparently it's actually just kind\nof let me stay on that Advanced,\n\n75\n00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.280\nso I was expecting this\nAttribute Editor tab not to be there,\n\n76\n00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.160\nis what I was expecting, and a few other\ntabs not to actually be available to us.\n\n77\n00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.920\nBut from right here, once I get here,\n\n78\n00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.190\nlet's say that I need to reset\nWalter's password, right?\n\n79\n00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.120\nIf I select Account,\nnotice that it's right here where it says,\n\n80\n00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.180\nhey, here is where you can\nchange some of the options.\n\n81\n00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.690\nAnd let's not say reset his\npassword from right here.\n\n82\n00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.350\nBut let's say that we can change the\naccount options right here and available.\n\n83\n00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.137\nSo anything that is checked, of course,\nthen if it gives you the ability to,\n\n84\n00:04:03.137 --> 00:04:04.410\nyou can uncheck that.\n\n85\n00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.900\nSo easy enough to modify in that sense.\n\n86\n00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.370\nBut if I wanted to reset his password,\nthough, see, if I scroll down here and\n\n87\n00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.340\nselect Walter, zoom in.\n\n88\n00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.760\nI normally can just simply right-click and\nreset his password right here.\n\n89\n00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.580\nWhen I do so, it will give me\nthe Reset Password dialog box, and\n\n90\n00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.240\nthis is where we would go do this.\n\n91\n00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.020\nNow you might be wondering,\nwhen the heck do I normally do this?\n\n92\n00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.640\nIf he forgets his password and\n\n93\n00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.560\nit locks him out, you may actually\nhave to unlock his account.\n\n94\n00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.420\nBut notice that his account is\nactually unlocked right now.\n\n95\n00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.310\nIf he believes that for one reason or\nanother his account has been compromised,\n\n96\n00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.200\nhe may wanna reset his password\nright then as well and\n\n97\n00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.830\nbe able to set this up to do so.\n\n98\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.530\nBut then, notice it says,\nchange the password at next logon.\n\n99\n00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.020\nNow here is a warning for\nus if we're actually doing this.\n\n100\n00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.860\nAs easy as it is to go, all right,\n\n101\n00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.160\nI'm just gonna reset it as my standard\ndefault password that I've set up for\n\n102\n00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.410\neverybody at the beginning,\nthis is probably not a good thing, okay.\n\n103\n00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.480\nWe wanna make sure that\nit's relatively complex.\n\n104\n00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.260\nWe wanna make sure that it is\nsomething different if we can.\n\n105\n00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.310\nAnd the reason why, right,\nis because now, if I continue to use\n\n106\n00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.200\nthat exact same password and Cherokee\nis a malicious actor in my network,\n\n107\n00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.780\nand she knows I'm gonna reset the password\nto the same thing every time, well,\n\n108\n00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.800\nshe can probably cause somebody to-\n&gt;&gt; Log out of their account.\n\n109\n00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.230\nI could put in the wrong password three\ntimes, or if I know, I could guess.\n\n110\n00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.410\nAnd try to brute force that to attempt to\nlock that end user out, and then I know.\n\n111\n00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.670\nI'm like okay, now Ronnie is gonna go.\n\n112\n00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.860\nThis is just normal behavior.\n\n113\n00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.190\nHe's gonna go in and\nreset that to the default password.\n\n114\n00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.780\nAnd then I could just type that in,\nand then I have access.\n\n115\n00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's why we don't wanna do that, right?\n\n116\n00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.370\n&gt;&gt; We want something that will\nactually help us out a little bit.\n\n117\n00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.960\nBut it does require you to\nbe a little bit creative.\n\n118\n00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.502\nRemember, think about those security\nthings that we normally do.\n\n119\n00:05:56.502 --> 00:05:59.520\nIt should be complex, it should be long.\n\n120\n00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.410\nSo take advantage of the length and the\ncomplexity idea, if you can, to make it\n\n121\n00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:10.370\na little bit more challenging for somebody\ndoing this when they start to have this.\n\n122\n00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.740\nSo make sure you're not using the same\none that you used 15 years ago.\n\n123\n00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.590\nI know that sounds strange,\nbut we all do it.\n\n124\n00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.280\nWe all continue to do some\nunusual things like that and\n\n125\n00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.070\nthat's what gets us in trouble.\n\n126\n00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:26.360\nSo modifying the password here, and also\nbeing a reset password, fairly easy thing.\n\n127\n00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.760\nI'm not gonna worry about doing it too\nmuch right now, cuz that's easy enough for\n\n128\n00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.850\nus to do But\n\n129\n00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.320\nI do wanna talk about some of those other\noptions like what we're seeing too.\n\n130\n00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.210\nNow let me take a look\nat Han Solo's here and\n\n131\n00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.980\nwe'll see something\na little bit different.\n\n132\n00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.317\nNow that I've selected Han Solo, notice\nthough that his particular user account,\n\n133\n00:06:46.317 --> 00:06:50.992\nactually does look a little bit different\nthan what I saw for Walter Mays.\n\n134\n00:06:50.992 --> 00:06:53.780\nI don't know if it will actually\nlet me do it side-by-side.\n\n135\n00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.290\nNo, it's not letting me,\nit just pulled up one versus the other.\n\n136\n00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.670\nI was hoping I could do that.\n\n137\n00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.890\nBut remember that for\nWalter's at one point,\n\n138\n00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.280\nit did show like the user attributes and\nstuff.\n\n139\n00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.620\nFor Han's, it didn't do that, and here\nby default, notice that his is missing\n\n140\n00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.750\nthat idea of the attributes, right,\nthe Attribute Editor that what we see.\n\n141\n00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.490\nNow Attribute Editor gives\nus the ability to add in\n\n142\n00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.320\nmore information than what we\nsee on each of these tabs.\n\n143\n00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.230\nSo if we wanted to, we do see some of\nthose, but there's actually even more that\n\n144\n00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.790\nwe can store right here in\nActive Directory if we choose to use it.\n\n145\n00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.050\nBut it does require you to\nactually be able to edit that and\n\n146\n00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.180\nadd that information in.\n\n147\n00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.700\nNow the problem that we have is simple.\n\n148\n00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.890\nIf we don't know how to get access to it,\nthen we can't do so.\n\n149\n00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:42.262\nSo if I select Han Solo,\nthen I can go up to View and\n\n150\n00:07:42.262 --> 00:07:45.905\nselect those advanced features again.\n\n151\n00:07:45.905 --> 00:07:51.149\nOnce I do that, I can go to Users,\nand now, if I select, notice that\n\n152\n00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:56.772\nit did add in, well, a few more\ndifferent tabs than what we saw earlier.\n\n153\n00:07:56.772 --> 00:08:02.630\nIt is here under Attribute Editor, for\nexample, That we can change any of these.\n\n154\n00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:03.890\nNow you do wanna be careful,\n\n155\n00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.420\nespecially with the ones that are filled\nin like this distinguished name here.\n\n156\n00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.400\nMake sure you don't mess\naround with stuff like that.\n\n157\n00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.350\nBut if you wanted to,\n\n158\n00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:15.530\nnotice you can do things like\nthe employee ID as a good example.\n\n159\n00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.640\nLet's say that we want to start actually\nadding in the user's employee ID\n\n160\n00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.990\nright here in Active Directory from here.\n\n161\n00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.240\nYou can simply modify that.\n\n162\n00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.620\nAnd now you can add that in and\nit will be stored right here.\n\n163\n00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.380\nSo not only might it be\nlocated inside of HR, but\n\n164\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.030\nyou can also locate it right here and\nbe able to apply that.\n\n165\n00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:37.590\nAnd there you go.\n\n166\n00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.000\nYou can change some of these attributes\nto help you store more information about\n\n167\n00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.140\nthe user that may be available for\n\n168\n00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.810\nus very easily by doing\nsomething like that as well.\n\n169\n00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.760\nNow remember,\nthose are just kind of two big examples of\n\n170\n00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.320\njust some of the more common tasks\nthat you might be asked to do.\n\n171\n00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.535\nChanging those attributes, probably\nnot something we'll do all the time.\n\n172\n00:08:59.535 --> 00:09:04.950\nBut resetting passwords or changing the\nway that the password is actually set or\n\n173\n00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.810\ndisabling somebody's account,\nfairly regular things that you\n\n174\n00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.530\nmay have to actually go ahead and\nbe able to understand as well.\n\n175\n00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.480\nNow let's make sure that we\nalso kind of pay attention to\n\n176\n00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.720\nthe way that we just did this, too.\n\n177\n00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.510\nRemember that the idea\nof server administration\n\n178\n00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.760\nis never about working with just\none account at a time, okay?\n\n179\n00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.930\nIt always seems like because that's how\nthe demonstrations that we normally do.\n\n180\n00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.588\nHere's how you change one user.\n\n181\n00:09:30.588 --> 00:09:35.104\nWell, you should now be able to apply that\nand take it to 10 users and 100 users and\n\n182\n00:09:35.104 --> 00:09:39.121\ndo all that, but it's still manipulating\nessentially one user at a time and\n\n183\n00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:41.050\ndoing something.\n\n184\n00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.590\nEven inside of the GUI interface,\njust like we showed you right there,\n\n185\n00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.220\nyou're still having to click on\nevery user to change something,\n\n186\n00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.270\nsuch as the employee ID and some of those\nother aspects that we were showing you.\n\n187\n00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.790\nIt still has to be done one at a time.\n\n188\n00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:57.150\nSo the problem is inside of\nan administrative setting,\n\n189\n00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.970\nyou're normally asked to\ndo more than one at a time.\n\n190\n00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.910\nSo it is pretty much on your shoulders\n\n191\n00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.960\nto essentially understand that\nthe way that you accomplish this\n\n192\n00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:12.430\nmuch more without a lot of administrative\neffort is to use PowerShell.\n\n193\n00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.710\nNow at the beginning, right,\nit is slower, at least for\n\n194\n00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.910\nyou because you're trying\nto get used to it.\n\n195\n00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.730\nIt's not as intuitive.\n\n196\n00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.170\nBut it is much more efficient, okay,\n\n197\n00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:26.460\nif you actually will take the time\nto do something like this as well.\n\n198\n00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.590\nMy recommendation, and you don't have\nto follow this if you choose to or\n\n199\n00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.050\nnot, but\nas you start to manage this stuff,\n\n200\n00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:37.400\nif you're working with a single account at\na time, use the Active Directory Users and\n\n201\n00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.340\nComputers, the Active Directory\nAdministration Center.\n\n202\n00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.050\nUse those to help you out.\n\n203\n00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:46.870\nIf you're gonna be having to modify and\nchange multiple things at one time.\n\n204\n00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.120\nThen instead you may want to go ahead and\n\n205\n00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.570\nuse the PowerShell to help\nyou to do that instead.\n\n206\n00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:54.500\nCuz that's something that actually\nwill be very valuable to you.\n\n207\n00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.200\nSo let's take an example right here\ninside of my Active Directory Users and\n\n208\n00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.890\nComputers, but\nI have an OU that's called RoadCrew, okay?\n\n209\n00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:07.260\nAnd let's say that inside of that RoadCrew\nI wanna make sure that these particular\n\n210\n00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:13.180\nusers, that their accounts are going to\nbe protected from accidental deletion.\n\n211\n00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.180\nBut because of the way that\nI created these accounts, or\n\n212\n00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.930\nlet's say that these accounts were created\nover time, over years and years, right?\n\n213\n00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:24.760\nSo if I do that and maybe where I didn't\nactually have some of those checked on\n\n214\n00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.880\nthe protected from accidental deletion,\nsome of that I did have protected.\n\n215\n00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.050\nBut I don't know and the only way for\n\n216\n00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.270\nme to do that is by individually\nclicking on each one and checking them.\n\n217\n00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.790\nLet me show you an example of\nwhat I'm talking about here.\n\n218\n00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.285\nSo here it is inside my\nActive Directory Users and Computers.\n\n219\n00:11:40.285 --> 00:11:44.073\nIf I expand Office 365,\nand here it is RoadCrew,\n\n220\n00:11:44.073 --> 00:11:47.265\nI've pretty much put\nall the hosts in here.\n\n221\n00:11:47.265 --> 00:11:49.119\nI didn't put Cherokee in here.\n\n222\n00:11:49.119 --> 00:11:53.004\nI put her in her own OU is what I did,\nright over here under I think publicity.\n\n223\n00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:55.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so there she is, okay?\n\n224\n00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.960\nSo let's say that these users are under\nRoadCrew and they were added in over time.\n\n225\n00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:04.500\nSo I don't know which one of them may\nbe protected from accidental deletion,\n\n226\n00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.560\nwhich one don't.\n\n227\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.165\nFor me to discover that right here,\nCherokee, there's really only one way.\n\n228\n00:12:09.165 --> 00:12:12.330\nDouble-click on each one, verify if\nthey're actually protected or not.\n\n229\n00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:13.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just drill through that list.\n\n230\n00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.530\n&gt;&gt; Drill through that list.\n\n231\n00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:19.800\nAgain, five, big deal, we're done in\nunder two or three minutes, okay?\n\n232\n00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:25.460\nBut what if this actually contained 50 or\n100 people or even 1,000 people?\n\n233\n00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.720\nAll of a sudden that becomes\nmuch more difficult,\n\n234\n00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.220\na little bit more time consuming.\n\n235\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.008\nThe administrative effort\nthen goes insanely high, and\n\n236\n00:12:32.008 --> 00:12:36.261\nthat's something we really don't want in\nMicrosoft Land, especially on the exams.\n\n237\n00:12:36.261 --> 00:12:39.970\nThey never want anything with\nhigh administrative effort.\n\n238\n00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.570\nSo here's where we would actually go and\nchange this in step.\n\n239\n00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:47.508\nSo I'm simply going to launch\nup PowerShell once again.\n\n240\n00:12:47.508 --> 00:12:52.440\nAnd we're gonna do this using\nPowerShell to help us out to do this.\n\n241\n00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.150\nSo if I'm going to be modifying multiple\nuser accounts, let's say especially for\n\n242\n00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.900\nthat one group, I want to go ahead and\n\n243\n00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:03.940\nsee if I can look through\nthat entire RoadCrew group.\n\n244\n00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:08.250\nAnd make sure that I set those to be\nprotected from accidental deletion.\n\n245\n00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.152\nThis is what we are going to do.\n\n246\n00:13:09.152 --> 00:13:15.500\nAll right, so I'm gonna Get-ADUser here.\n\n247\n00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:19.200\nI'm gonna filter it out for everyone and\n\n248\n00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.340\ntell it to search the entire base here,\nis what I'm going to do.\n\n249\n00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.189\nNow if I do that,\nit will actually go through and\n\n250\n00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:30.285\nlook at the entire Active Directory.\n\n251\n00:13:30.285 --> 00:13:32.520\nNow I don't want it to\nsearch through everything.\n\n252\n00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.190\nI could, I could search everything.\n\n253\n00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.180\nBut let's say I wanted to\nlimit this to that one OU.\n\n254\n00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.973\nSo here you do OU, and\nthis would be RoadCrew.\n\n255\n00:13:45.722 --> 00:13:51.276\nAnd this is where we\nhave to again kind of,\n\n256\n00:13:51.276 --> 00:13:58.103\nlet's see,\nthis will then go to OUOffice365,\n\n257\n00:13:58.103 --> 00:14:02.890\nthen the distinguished name here.\n\n258\n00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:13.610\nAnd that would be officeprodemoco,\n\n259\n00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:18.601\nofficeprodemoco DC\n\n260\n00:14:18.601 --> 00:14:22.421\non Microsoft.\n\n261\n00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:28.350\nI always wanna put .com immediately.\n\n262\n00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:29.233\nAnd then DC com.\n\n263\n00:14:32.298 --> 00:14:39.649\nThen we're gonna pipe\nthat into Set- AdObject\n\n264\n00:14:39.649 --> 00:14:48.482\n-ProtectedfromAccidentalDeletion $True,\nright?\n\n265\n00:14:48.482 --> 00:14:52.714\nNow if everything actually does work\nout right, I have essentially said,\n\n266\n00:14:52.714 --> 00:14:55.410\nhey, filter everything but\ntake a look where?\n\n267\n00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.650\nSearch that one OU is\nwhat I've told it to do.\n\n268\n00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:02.640\nSo if there's any mistake, it's probably\ngonna be in my distinguished name.\n\n269\n00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.188\nWhy?\n\n270\n00:15:03.188 --> 00:15:07.610\nWell, because it's long and because I\nhad to type all of it out to do this.\n\n271\n00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:12.560\nSo if there's any typo, I'm trying to just\ngo through quickly here, and verify, and\n\n272\n00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.130\nsee if I see any real regular typo here.\n\n273\n00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:20.440\nI don't see, but I think everything\nelse looks good from this point,\n\n274\n00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:25.070\nunless I missed a DC somewhere,\nor an OU somewhere.\n\n275\n00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.189\nSo that might be the only thing,\nif I do any of this.\n\n276\n00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.160\nSet the object.\n\n277\n00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.110\nProtected accidental deletion is true.\n\n278\n00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.620\nSo if I type it in, right,\nI should be able press Enter and\n\n279\n00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.170\nit accepts the whole thing.\n\n280\n00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:44.590\nAnd we are now ready to go ahead and check\nand see if everything is actually done.\n\n281\n00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.240\nSo here, it does.\n\n282\n00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.505\nIn that one single pass,\n\n283\n00:15:47.505 --> 00:15:51.799\nI was able to essentially set everybody's\ncondition here to do what we wanted to do.\n\n284\n00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:54.960\nAnd let's verify inside here.\n\n285\n00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.690\nNow I didn't verify.\n\n286\n00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:56.940\nI should've, but I didn't.\n\n287\n00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:00.487\nSo it's under here where it would say\nwhat, if the account was locked out,\n\n288\n00:16:00.487 --> 00:16:03.641\nwe would actually go ahead And\nwe would see that it's locked out and\n\n289\n00:16:03.641 --> 00:16:05.300\nthen we would unlock the account.\n\n290\n00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.235\nBut this one is fine, and we would also\nend up seeing that little down arrow on\n\n291\n00:16:09.235 --> 00:16:13.790\neach one of these accounts as well if\nthey had been locked out at some point.\n\n292\n00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:18.160\nSo on the deletion, wait,\nwhere did we see the deletion?\n\n293\n00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.580\nSee, all of a sudden my mind\nkind of went past somewhere.\n\n294\n00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.810\nNow let's see, can we see that right here?\n\n295\n00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:26.510\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to think.\n\n296\n00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:29.637\nI know you automatically see it\nwhen you create the account but\n\n297\n00:16:29.637 --> 00:16:30.728\nwhere is that place?\n\n298\n00:16:30.728 --> 00:16:31.904\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so on here,\n\n299\n00:16:31.904 --> 00:16:35.960\nI might need to go to PowerShell to\nhelp us to find that one as well.\n\n300\n00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.510\n&gt;&gt; That setting.\n\n301\n00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.029\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n302\n00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:40.811\nAll right, so the great thing is we can\nkind of reuse part of our command in\n\n303\n00:16:40.811 --> 00:16:43.610\nthe way that we can try and\ndo a few things here.\n\n304\n00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:47.140\nSo if I do to get-Aduser again and\n\n305\n00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:52.780\nlet's filter this back out\nby the OU that we need\n\n306\n00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:59.080\nlet's do a Searchbase This is OU and\nthis was RoadCrew, I\n\n307\n00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:06.080\nhope it was RoadCrew [LAUGH] OUOffice 365.\n\n308\n00:17:10.795 --> 00:17:13.777\nI always never know if some of\nthese spaces really matter, so\n\n309\n00:17:13.777 --> 00:17:16.360\nI try to keep it consistent\nis what I'm trying to do.\n\n310\n00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:22.570\nAnd then the distinguish name here,\n\n311\n00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:25.926\nthat's gonna begin with OFFICEPRODEMOCO.\n\n312\n00:17:25.926 --> 00:17:31.093\nAnother DCE\n\n313\n00:17:31.093 --> 00:17:37.812\non Microsoft.\n\n314\n00:17:37.812 --> 00:17:40.318\nMicrosoft, if I can spell it right.\n\n315\n00:17:40.318 --> 00:17:44.447\nOn MicrosoftDCcom.\n\n316\n00:17:44.447 --> 00:17:46.930\nHopefully close that off.\n\n317\n00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:52.460\nFrom this point,\nI need to add in a -Properties and\n\n318\n00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.340\nnow here comes the hard part, right?\n\n319\n00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.460\nSo I'm saying hey search through,\ndo all this,\n\n320\n00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:01.400\nbut just essentially also\nshow me properties for\n\n321\n00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:08.560\nthe ProtectedfromAccidentalDeletion.\n\n322\n00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.410\nOkay, and it says one or\nmore properties isn't done.\n\n323\n00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.160\nSo let me see what I've done here.\n\n324\n00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.710\nI went ahead and\ndid this a little bit earlier.\n\n325\n00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:15.930\nThat's why I did that.\n\n326\n00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.990\nSo now if I run that through,\n\n327\n00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:24.660\nnow you can actually see where it did\nactually go through that particular OU.\n\n328\n00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.110\nAnd now you can see\nthe ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion.\n\n329\n00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.210\nEverything here was\nessentially set to being true.\n\n330\n00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:34.950\nAnd it's actually within that one OU.\n\n331\n00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.100\nSo it is under properties, right here,\nwhere you can go ahead and\n\n332\n00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.300\nyou can see all that.\n\n333\n00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:39.990\nAnd that helps us.\n\n334\n00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:45.440\nNow, also in our chat,\nwe did get someone to point out to us\n\n335\n00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.750\nwhere this is also located\nright here as well.\n\n336\n00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.750\nSo if I select once again Daniel,\nlet's say this time.\n\n337\n00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.340\nAnd this is intuitively found of course.\n\n338\n00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:00.330\nSo unlike having that account being\nprotected from accidental deletion,\n\n339\n00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:04.400\napparently it's an object that's protected\nfrom accidental deletion instead.\n\n340\n00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:09.050\nAnd notice right here where it says,\nProject object from accidental deletion.\n\n341\n00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:10.520\nSome of the things that logically,\n\n342\n00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.480\nas you create the account,\nyou set it up the way you think it is.\n\n343\n00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.070\nBut it's the way that active\ndirectory reads it, and\n\n344\n00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.930\nthey see it as an object that\nwe're protecting instead.\n\n345\n00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:24.240\nSo that's where we would end up finding\nthat out for each user as well.\n\n346\n00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:30.010\nSo, this gives us that ability to\nmodify multiple accounts at one time.\n\n347\n00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.710\nAnd this way you can see\nwhy the PowerShell is gonna\n\n348\n00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:37.250\nbe a lot more efficient in all\nthe things that we're actually doing.\n\n349\n00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.450\nNow, the other thing that we also want to\ntalk about and we've only got a couple of\n\n350\n00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:45.890\ntopics left here, but of course is just\nenabling and disabling accounts too.\n\n351\n00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:49.530\nNow Cherokee, when it comes down\nto the idea of disabling accounts.\n\n352\n00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.790\nWe normally can disable accounts,\n\n353\n00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.150\nbut can you think of a situation in which\nwe would choose to disable an account?\n\n354\n00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:02.605\n&gt;&gt; So, if I had someone being terminated\nwhether it was on their own choice or\n\n355\n00:20:02.605 --> 00:20:04.235\nif they had to leave the organization.\n\n356\n00:20:04.235 --> 00:20:06.895\nI might want to go ahead and\ndisable that account for\n\n357\n00:20:06.895 --> 00:20:11.735\na period maybe like 30 days until I found\na replacement for that job role and\n\n358\n00:20:11.735 --> 00:20:14.865\nmade sure they access\nto all the components.\n\n359\n00:20:14.865 --> 00:20:19.325\nIt wasn't anything that was\nproprietary to that individual user.\n\n360\n00:20:19.325 --> 00:20:23.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so\ntermination is usually the big one, right?\n\n361\n00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.570\nAlso if somebody takes,\nlet's say a leave of absence, right?\n\n362\n00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:28.530\nWe don't want their particular account-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good point.\n\n363\n00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:31.780\n&gt;&gt; It could be like maternity leave or\nsomething where they go,\n\n364\n00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.390\nlook I'm not gonna be here for\nthe next 90 days or whatever it might be.\n\n365\n00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:38.210\nYou're not technically terminating them,\nbut\n\n366\n00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.860\nyou really don't want that account\njust to be floating around and\n\n367\n00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:45.820\nopen if you know that for whatever period\nof time that they're not gonna login.\n\n368\n00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.929\nNow they call you and go hey what happened\nto my account, you can let them know that\n\n369\n00:20:48.929 --> 00:20:51.833\nwe disabled it because we weren't\nexpecting you to actually do anything.\n\n370\n00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:55.100\nSo you may actually do\nsomething like that as well.\n\n371\n00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:59.940\nAnd of course, if you are in the midst\nof that unusual thing, where you\n\n372\n00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:04.720\nare investigating a particular account\nthat may have been hacked as well and\n\n373\n00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.570\nyou do not want people accessing it or\ndoing something like that.\n\n374\n00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.340\nYou may actually not only do that but\n\n375\n00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:14.060\nmaybe in their email account go through\nand even have a litigation hold and\n\n376\n00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.520\ndo all of that other stuff and\nmake sure everything is done there too.\n\n377\n00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.440\nBut sometimes you do have to make\nsure that you can disable those\n\n378\n00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.010\naccounts as well, you know, to do that.\n\n379\n00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:26.690\nSo when we do that,\nit's actually fairly easy for us to do so.\n\n380\n00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:31.371\nInside of Active Directory Users\nof Computers is fairly simple,\n\n381\n00:21:31.371 --> 00:21:36.010\nyou kind of have actually seen\na lot of times on disabling it.\n\n382\n00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:40.010\nHow easy it really is,\nwhich is you would select in the count.\n\n383\n00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:43.790\nAnd then from here, you would go to\nthe accounts here and let's see.\n\n384\n00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.810\nActually it's not there we\njust right click don't we?\n\n385\n00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:51.290\nWe right click and\nit's here that we would go to.\n\n386\n00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:51.850\nWhere is that?\n\n387\n00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:52.895\n&gt;&gt; What are you looking for?\n\n388\n00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:55.890\n&gt;&gt; I'm looking for\nthe disabling the account.\n\n389\n00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:56.490\nThere it is.\n\n390\n00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.820\nI was going to say, it is right here.\n\n391\n00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.920\nI read through this and I was like,\nwhere the heck is disable the account?\n\n392\n00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.450\nI looked at it three times in a row,\nI was like it's not here.\n\n393\n00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:05.200\nBut there it is.\n\n394\n00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.800\nIt's just me trying to read faster than\nwhat my eyes could actually handle.\n\n395\n00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.550\nThere it is,\nsitting right in front of me and\n\n396\n00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.940\neven though I've kind of hovered\nover it a couple of times.\n\n397\n00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:14.780\nIt's not there.\n\n398\n00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.690\nSo disabling someone's account,\nlook there it goes.\n\n399\n00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.880\nIt now tells you it was disabled and\n\n400\n00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:24.810\nyou get a nice little tiny warning, you\nknow, not easy enough for someone to see.\n\n401\n00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.640\n&gt;&gt; Not glaring, but it's there.\n\n402\n00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.040\n&gt;&gt; It's there, it's tiny,\nwhen you start to see something like that.\n\n403\n00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.420\nBut that's fairly easy to be able to do.\n\n404\n00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:36.080\nNow we wanna introduce another\nsmall tool that's also available,\n\n405\n00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.240\nI shouldn't say small.\n\n406\n00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.080\nAnother tool that's available to you,\nwhich is of\n\n407\n00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:45.220\ncourse the Active Directory Administrative\nCenter that you can also use as well.\n\n408\n00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:49.410\nInside the R SAT Tools, you'll look for,\nand it should say exactly that,\n\n409\n00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:51.970\nActive Directory Administrative Center.\n\n410\n00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:55.000\nFrom there over on the left-hand side,\nyou would select your domain.\n\n411\n00:22:58.025 --> 00:23:02.480\nAnd now inside of your domain, you could\nscroll down and select your Users or\n\n412\n00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.998\neven let's go back to Office365 here.\n\n413\n00:23:04.998 --> 00:23:07.660\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie,\nsomeone had mentioned in the chat.\n\n414\n00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:11.265\nIt's kind of ironic that\nyou disabled Don's account.\n\n415\n00:23:11.265 --> 00:23:11.765\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n&gt;&gt; Our boss' account.\n\n416\n00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:12.303\n&gt;&gt; You better\n\n417\n00:23:12.303 --> 00:23:13.014\nbelieve it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n418\n00:23:13.014 --> 00:23:14.601\n&gt;&gt; Yeah He's the one that could do the\n\n419\n00:23:14.601 --> 00:23:18.660\nmost damage, that's why you do that, yeah.\nYou definitely want to do that,\n\n420\n00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.350\nsomething like that, of course.\n\n421\n00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:23.680\nSo, right here,\nonce again it's kind of the same thing.\n\n422\n00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.350\nI right click instead, let's say,\n\n423\n00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:29.230\nthis time I'm gonna choose Justin and\ndisable his account.\n\n424\n00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.814\nAnd you'll see it really\nbrings you the same result.\n\n425\n00:23:31.814 --> 00:23:34.972\nThis is probably a tool that\nyou want to become more and\n\n426\n00:23:34.972 --> 00:23:38.770\nmore familiar with because it\nis designed for administration.\n\n427\n00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:41.376\nAnd you don't actually have\nto bring up individual tools,\n\n428\n00:23:41.376 --> 00:23:44.866\nthis is actually designed to help you out\nin all your administrative capacities\n\n429\n00:23:44.866 --> 00:23:46.287\nthat you have available to you.\n\n430\n00:23:46.287 --> 00:23:51.117\nYou of course can also use the Task\npane over here on the right hand\n\n431\n00:23:51.117 --> 00:23:55.775\nside to re-enable those accounts\nif you choose very easily.\n\n432\n00:23:55.775 --> 00:23:59.816\nNow along with that,\nyou of course have PowerShell.\n\n433\n00:23:59.816 --> 00:24:02.621\nLet me clear that screen\nright back off here.\n\n434\n00:24:02.621 --> 00:24:06.599\nAnd once we actually take a look\nat PowerShell, disabling or\n\n435\n00:24:06.599 --> 00:24:10.110\nenabling an account is\nactually fairly easy as well.\n\n436\n00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:14.160\nSo if I actually want to enable\nthe Active Directory account, I could do\n\n437\n00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.030\nthat right here, oops, looks like I'm\nlosing my connection to something.\n\n438\n00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:24.822\nSo that would be, why can't I\nspell AD [LAUGH] ADAccount From\n\n439\n00:24:24.822 --> 00:24:29.010\nhere you would select the identity\nthat you want to enable.\n\n440\n00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:33.175\nNow on this one, I don't know,\nlet me see, I've got to check.\n\n441\n00:24:33.175 --> 00:24:33.900\n&gt;&gt; I think he was already enabled or\ndisabled.\n\n442\n00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if it was already enabled or not.\n\n443\n00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.610\nLet me check,\n\n444\n00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:41.630\nI think I had one account that I had\ncreated that was actually not enabled.\n\n445\n00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.630\nAnd it is Luke Skywalker's account.\n\n446\n00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.668\nIt's not, but\nI can't know what the account name is.\n\n447\n00:24:46.668 --> 00:24:53.730\nSo here, Let's see, no we can try.\n\n448\n00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:57.860\nAll right so let's go ahead and\nsee, oops wrong way.\n\n449\n00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.440\nWhere's my machine?\n\n450\n00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:06.860\nI'm actually on the same machine,\nthat's me being an idiot.\n\n451\n00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.350\nAll right, so\nlet's just pick Wes for example.\n\n452\n00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:16.260\nOf course, his is not gonna be,\nit's gonna be wbryan I think, there we go.\n\n453\n00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:19.620\nSo I was trying to make sure\nthat I did something and\n\n454\n00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.950\nI forgot that I had changed my name.\n\n455\n00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:24.170\nIt's never a good thing but I had\nforgotten that on some of these I went\n\n456\n00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:26.730\nahead and\ndid first names on the ones I did today.\n\n457\n00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:32.280\nBut usually the first initial,\nlast name is what I did.\n\n458\n00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:36.070\nSo very easy to be able to do right away.\n\n459\n00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:39.400\nThe great thing though is, on this one,\ninside of the Active Directory Users and\n\n460\n00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.590\nComputers, you can select\nmultiple accounts and\n\n461\n00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:43.650\ndisable them all at one time as well.\n\n462\n00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:47.540\nSo a little bit backward, whereas here\nyou can probably do the same thing, but\n\n463\n00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.708\nalso in Active Directory you can\ndo the same thing as well, Okay?\n\n464\n00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:56.890\nLast little bit that we want to\nshow you how to do is create\n\n465\n00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:02.090\nwhat we call a template, is what we want\nto do, especially for account creations.\n\n466\n00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.720\nRemember that when we actually create\nan account and we put them in OU and\n\n467\n00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.810\nwe do sync, we may want to go ahead and\n\n468\n00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:13.250\ninstead of us have to do everything\nby scratch and get everything set up.\n\n469\n00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:16.170\nWe may wanna go ahead and\nset up what we call a template account.\n\n470\n00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:18.770\nAnd when we do something like that,\nit allows us to go through and\n\n471\n00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.780\ncreate something fairly easily to do so.\n\n472\n00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.640\nLet me see where I actually put it\nhere instead, right there, okay.\n\n473\n00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.202\nSo under the ConstructCrew OU that I had,\n\n474\n00:26:28.202 --> 00:26:33.120\nI have created one that's called\na TEMPLATE account instead.\n\n475\n00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.250\nNow what normally ends\nup happening is that,\n\n476\n00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:38.090\nwhatever the first account\nthat you create here,\n\n477\n00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:42.660\nyou normally also can simply create\na template account and you disable it.\n\n478\n00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:46.850\nBut then when I wanna create a new user,\nI simply right click and\n\n479\n00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:48.990\nthen I can copy this account.\n\n480\n00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.490\nAnd from here, whatever is actually\nalready set up whatever it is,\n\n481\n00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:57.430\nyou go ahead and you create it\nin the same fashion and manner.\n\n482\n00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.730\nSo you actually continue\nto use the same thing.\n\n483\n00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.540\nYou don't have to worry about\nsetting up everything over and\n\n484\n00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.700\nover again,\nit just gives you that ability to do so.\n\n485\n00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:10.990\nSo creating this template account\nreally is helpful when you have many\n\n486\n00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:14.900\nthat you are actually creating and you\ndon't know exactly what you had to set.\n\n487\n00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.680\nBut normally you'd create one of these for\nevery OU or\n\n488\n00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.010\nevery container that you're gonna create.\n\n489\n00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:23.530\nAnd that way it will follow the same\nconvention and the same structure and\n\n490\n00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.150\nthe same way that you have it built for\neverybody in that OU.\n\n491\n00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.800\nSo that's a good idea as well, okay?\n\n492\n00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.130\nCan you create templates inside\nof PowerShell if you choose to?\n\n493\n00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:34.860\nYou absolutely can, okay?\n\n494\n00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.550\nBut the problem with\nthe PowerShell is simple,\n\n495\n00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:41.040\nit still takes some time before\nyou can do something like that,\n\n496\n00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.150\nto actually be able to\ncreate a template for this.\n\n497\n00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.370\nSo there are commands for you to do it.\n\n498\n00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:51.070\nIt is a long process at the very beginning\nand you wanna see how to create that,\n\n499\n00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:55.910\nmake sure you do check out Bryan's book on\ncreating a template using the PowerShell.\n\n500\n00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.890\nYou've already seen me type out so many\ncommands that are relatively long today.\n\n501\n00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:03.490\nBut overall though, just kind of\nremember that templates can be created\n\n502\n00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:05.590\nin both instances if you do that.\n\n503\n00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:09.430\nBut even with the templates\ninside of PowerShell, still gonna\n\n504\n00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:13.890\nrequire some typing for you to actually\nbe able to use that template to do so.\n\n505\n00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:16.850\nBut normally inside the GUI we\nsee the advantage of it much\n\n506\n00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:19.210\nquicker than we do inside\nof the PowerShell.\n\n507\n00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:23.290\nSo, right there,\nreally the basics on the idea here\n\n508\n00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:27.950\nof continuing in the creation process and\nhow we get more efficient at doing it.\n\n509\n00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:32.130\nThere is still some to go in terms of\nother topics that we need to cover.\n\n510\n00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.730\nBut that should be Be enough to at least\nget you started in the creation of\n\n511\n00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:35.620\nuser accounts.\n\n512\n00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:36.360\n&gt;&gt; I think so, Ronnie.\n\n513\n00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.570\nYou've given us enough tools here\nto be able to go ahead and play and\n\n514\n00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.030\npractice and like you said,\n\n515\n00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:45.580\nthese are gonna be pretty common tasks\nthat we may encounter as an administrator.\n\n516\n00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.740\nSo for this show, we'll go ahead and\nsign out but remember I'm your host,\n\n517\n00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:49.530\nCherokee Boose.\n\n518\n00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:50.370\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n519\n00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:51.847\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n520\n00:28:51.847 -->

00:00:08.338\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.338 --> 00:00:12.151\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:15.930\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and gentlemen to\nyour Microsoft Server 101 series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.115\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:19.590\nSo in previous episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.520\nRonnie showed us how to create different\nusers within Active Directory.\n\n9\n00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.860\nBut in this show we're really gonna be\ntaking a look at how we can go ahead and\n\n10\n00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.530\nmanage those users.\n\n11\n00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.030\nBack in studios with us today,\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.330\nThanks for joining use today, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.140\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back as\nwe continue on in taking a look at more,\n\n14\n00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.930\nlearning about Active Directory.\n\n15\n00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.321\nAnd some of the skills and tasks that we\nneed to at least be familiar with if we\n\n16\n00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:48.010\nget into that role where we are going to\nbe working with servers on a daily basis.\n\n17\n00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.138\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so, Ronnie, when we talk about\nadministrative duties somethings like\n\n18\n00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:55.900\nspitting up a particular server and\nsetting it up We do ever so often.\n\n19\n00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.750\nBut when we're working with and\nActive Directory,\n\n20\n00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.700\nthere are probably a lot of repetitive\ntype task that we encounter, right?\n\n21\n00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.450\n&gt;&gt; Yep, there pretty much are.\n\n22\n00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.530\nAnd some of those different types of task,\nespecially in working with user accounts,\n\n23\n00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.830\nare going to be things that you'll\njust have to know how to do.\n\n24\n00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.400\nAnd you'll have to be able to\ndo them quickly a lot of times,\n\n25\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.820\nbecause people are waiting.\n\n26\n00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.302\nIf they can't get logged into the machines\nyou'll need to do a little bit of\n\n27\n00:01:20.302 --> 00:01:24.021\ntroubleshooting and then you'll need to\nbe able to implement some type of fix.\n\n28\n00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:28.818\nSo for example, one of those types\nmanaging task that we really have to do is\n\n29\n00:01:28.818 --> 00:01:32.104\nsomething just as simple\nas resetting a password.\n\n30\n00:01:32.104 --> 00:01:35.193\nIt's not difficult but\nit is something we definitely need to do.\n\n31\n00:01:35.193 --> 00:01:39.035\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, and I know I kept mentioning\nthis and it is very important for\n\n32\n00:01:39.035 --> 00:01:41.560\nus to go ahead to reset those password.\n\n33\n00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.404\nBut what's the significance behind that?\n\n34\n00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:48.392\n&gt;&gt; Well, you gotta think that there\nare times which all of us have had happen,\n\n35\n00:01:48.392 --> 00:01:50.800\nespecially if we're new of the job.\n\n36\n00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.300\nEven though a password has\nbeen assigned to us and\n\n37\n00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.530\neven though we might have actually\ngone ahead and created a password\n\n38\n00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.430\naccording to the security policy of that\ncompany and it requires anything complex.\n\n39\n00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.527\nProbably within that first week or so,\n\n40\n00:02:04.527 --> 00:02:07.712\npeople have actually forgotten\ntheir passwords already.\n\n41\n00:02:07.712 --> 00:02:11.342\nSo resetting that password is actually\nsomething that we may have to do.\n\n42\n00:02:11.342 --> 00:02:14.397\nUnless they're trying to use\na default password that we gave them,\n\n43\n00:02:14.397 --> 00:02:16.018\nwhich is never a good idea anyways.\n\n44\n00:02:16.018 --> 00:02:19.482\nBut at least that idea is something\nthat we have to run across.\n\n45\n00:02:19.482 --> 00:02:22.256\nSo the reasons why we might reset\na password are things like people\n\n46\n00:02:22.256 --> 00:02:23.550\nforgetting it.\n\n47\n00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.450\nBut, let's say that it's not\nsomething that's forgotten, but\n\n48\n00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.150\nall the sudden we're monitoring.\n\n49\n00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.710\nAnd we're realizing something.\n\n50\n00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.680\nThat Cherokee is actually logged\ninto multiple different machines.\n\n51\n00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.141\nBut, when we go and\nask Cherokee about it, she says,\n\n52\n00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:38.241\nI haven't been logging into anywhere else.\n\n53\n00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:42.690\nAnd now, Cherokee begins to essentially\nhelp us to raise a little bit of an alert.\n\n54\n00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.160\nSaying hey, something else is going\non here besides what we need to do.\n\n55\n00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.384\nWe find out those machines,\nof course we logged them out, but\n\n56\n00:02:49.384 --> 00:02:53.600\nif we leave the password as set, that's\ngonna allow for whoever might have taken\n\n57\n00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.589\nadvantage of her particular username and\npassword to be able to get back in.\n\n58\n00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:01.153\nSo resetting her password might actually\nbe something that we also want to take\n\n59\n00:03:01.153 --> 00:03:02.131\nadvantage of doing.\n\n60\n00:03:02.131 --> 00:03:05.664\nNow, there's probably other conditions and\nother situations that we might have.\n\n61\n00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:10.200\nBut, those are two good situations that at\nleast I can think of, off the top of my\n\n62\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.550\nhead, when we start talking about the idea\nof resetting that password as well okay?\n\n63\n00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.890\nNow, the unusual thing about it Is\nthat as a server administrator,\n\n64\n00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.220\nor an active directory administrator,\nwe become so busy with other task.\n\n65\n00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.360\nThis is something that's just easy for\nus to do.\n\n66\n00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.347\nAnd if the same user continually\ncomes to us and says,\n\n67\n00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:39.146\nI keep forgetting the password\ncuz I keep making it too complex.\n\n68\n00:03:39.146 --> 00:03:41.319\nWell, you don't really wanna tell\nthem to make it less complex\n\n69\n00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.650\nthan what they have it.\n\n70\n00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.850\nBut you don't wanna reset it all the time.\n\n71\n00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.520\nSo, Cherokee, if you were doing this or if\nyou've actually seen this happen, right?\n\n72\n00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.486\nWould you actually just go, all right,\nhere's what I'm gonna do instead.\n\n73\n00:03:54.486 --> 00:03:57.610\nCuz Ronnie is obviously bad\nat remembering passwords.\n\n74\n00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.950\nWhat is an option I may choose to do as an\nadministrator that's really a bad option?\n\n75\n00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.089\n&gt;&gt; So\na bad option would be to go ahead and\n\n76\n00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:07.471\ngive them the right to be able\nto reset their own password.\n\n77\n00:04:07.471 --> 00:04:12.574\nBut something that you could do instead\nwith an Active Directory would be,\n\n78\n00:04:12.574 --> 00:04:16.383\nmaybe there is a site manager,\nlike an office manager.\n\n79\n00:04:16.383 --> 00:04:19.470\nAnd you work for IT, and\nyou're not even there locally.\n\n80\n00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.969\nSo maybe you could go ahead and give some\ndelegation to that site manager to go\n\n81\n00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:28.137\nahead, perform some really basic\nrudimentary type tasks like that.\n\n82\n00:04:28.137 --> 00:04:31.769\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so when you do something\nlike that, and that's a good thing to do,\n\n83\n00:04:31.769 --> 00:04:34.152\nbut what does that manager\nend up doing sometimes?\n\n84\n00:04:34.152 --> 00:04:37.045\nEspecially if Ronnie gets really bad at\nit, he's coming to him every other day.\n\n85\n00:04:37.045 --> 00:04:43.529\nAs I am there's an option here that says,\npassword should never expire.\n\n86\n00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:47.134\nNow what are the chances that somebody\nelse survive even delegated those\n\n87\n00:04:47.134 --> 00:04:50.340\nto somebody to a supervisor that\nmight be what they end up doing.\n\n88\n00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.352\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean that could happen, if that\ndoes happen you might wanna look at may be\n\n89\n00:04:54.352 --> 00:04:58.600\nretraining that employee because it's not\nsomething usually you wanna stick within\n\n90\n00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.805\nyour password policy or\nyour security policy and abide by that.\n\n91\n00:05:01.805 --> 00:05:03.583\nBut that doesn't always happen.\n\n92\n00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:06.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you've delegated\nthe permissions off to them.\n\n93\n00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.920\nWell, they have all\nthose options available.\n\n94\n00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.910\nThey might go Ronnie\nis really bad at this.\n\n95\n00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.810\nThis is the third time this week.\n\n96\n00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.250\nLet me just do this instead.\n\n97\n00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.890\nAnd that way it doesn't.\n\n98\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.360\nHis password's never going to expire.\n\n99\n00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.820\nSo after a while.\n\n100\n00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.690\nLet's just say that they do it with a good\nintention of changing it after a week.\n\n101\n00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.010\nWe'll give them a whole week\nof using that same password.\n\n102\n00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.924\nAnd maybe that way,\nhe'll be able to do this.\n\n103\n00:05:28.924 --> 00:05:30.250\nAnd then we forget it, right?\n\n104\n00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.360\nAnd that person forgets it, whoever it\nis that we delegated it to forgets that.\n\n105\n00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.700\nAnd they leave it set there, well let's\nthink about some of the situations\n\n106\n00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.360\nthat that may actually end up causing and\nbring it up as well.\n\n107\n00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.651\nSo for example, in that situation, whoever\nthe administrator is forgets to say,\n\n108\n00:05:48.651 --> 00:05:52.668\nlet me uncheck that after we fill out and\nthey've gotten that.\n\n109\n00:05:52.668 --> 00:05:56.659\nWell, what's the big deal that I leave\nthat password there now for six months?\n\n110\n00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:00.713\n&gt;&gt; Well, attackers,\nreally depending on their motive, but\n\n111\n00:06:00.713 --> 00:06:03.964\na good attacker will really\ntry to just lay low.\n\n112\n00:06:03.964 --> 00:06:08.560\nAnd maybe their motive is blackmail, or\nany kind of obtaining any information.\n\n113\n00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.410\nSo if an account has been compromised,\nthey may just wanna go ahead and\n\n114\n00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:18.040\nlay low and eavesdrop for\nthat six months period of time.\n\n115\n00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really amazing, right?\n\n116\n00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.488\nThe very fact is we give an attacker\nthat's good at what he's doing, more\n\n117\n00:06:23.488 --> 00:06:27.800\nopportunity and time, to realize something\nthat that account is not changing.\n\n118\n00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.876\nSo it's not like he's going ahead and\nhe's doing a bruteforce attack,\n\n119\n00:06:30.876 --> 00:06:34.180\nand then we change the password,\nand he has to start all over again.\n\n120\n00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.673\nWe're just saying just continue to do your\nwork and do that in the background and\n\n121\n00:06:38.673 --> 00:06:40.361\ndon't worry about it at all.\n\n122\n00:06:40.361 --> 00:06:44.633\nSo that's something we really don't want\nto do and make sure that we don't do that.\n\n123\n00:06:44.633 --> 00:06:48.952\nNow the other thing of course is that if\nwe also set this where the password never\n\n124\n00:06:48.952 --> 00:06:53.420\nexpires, it means that if now I delegate\nthat responsibility to somebody else.\n\n125\n00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.260\nLet's say that that person that I\ndelegated to was really bad and\n\n126\n00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.170\nI delegate it to somebody else.\n\n127\n00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.326\nAnd they forget to remove that check mark.\n\n128\n00:07:00.326 --> 00:07:01.650\nNow they go, simple.\n\n129\n00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.190\nI'll just reset Ronnie's password, and\n\n130\n00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.700\nhe'll be able to actually\ncreate a new one.\n\n131\n00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.774\nWell now that that's checked, right?\n\n132\n00:07:07.774 --> 00:07:09.784\nPassword never expires and reset it.\n\n133\n00:07:09.784 --> 00:07:14.774\nThat password, can he actually end up\ntyping the same one again and still go?\n\n134\n00:07:14.774 --> 00:07:16.115\nYou better believe it.\n\n135\n00:07:16.115 --> 00:07:19.828\nAnd so this actually causes\na very unusual conundrum here,\n\n136\n00:07:19.828 --> 00:07:22.511\nsomething we don't want to happen right.\n\n137\n00:07:22.511 --> 00:07:25.455\nSo resetting passwords and\ndoing it effectively is the key,\n\n138\n00:07:25.455 --> 00:07:29.265\nthe problem that the administration side\nis that I mentioned in another active\n\n139\n00:07:29.265 --> 00:07:31.188\ndirectory show that we've just done.\n\n140\n00:07:31.188 --> 00:07:35.040\nIs, well we get lazy as\nadministrators as well.\n\n141\n00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.415\nWhen I reset somebody's password issues\nlead to something that I'm going to\n\n142\n00:07:39.415 --> 00:07:42.509\nremember and\neven though I tell them to change that to,\n\n143\n00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:44.142\nwhatever that they need to.\n\n144\n00:07:44.142 --> 00:07:46.302\nI've put that check mark there that says,\n\n145\n00:07:46.302 --> 00:07:49.981\nmake sure that they on the next log on\nthey have to change their password.\n\n146\n00:07:49.981 --> 00:07:52.884\nIs still the same password that I have\nbeen using now for the past five years.\n\n147\n00:07:52.884 --> 00:07:54.584\nCherokee was wrong with that?\n\n148\n00:07:54.584 --> 00:07:59.307\nWell Ronnie, I can see a lot wrong with\nthat because if an attacker were able to\n\n149\n00:07:59.307 --> 00:08:04.033\ncompromise one of your accounts,\nyou probably have an affinity towards that\n\n150\n00:08:04.033 --> 00:08:07.972\npassword, especially if you've\nbeen using it for five years.\n\n151\n00:08:07.972 --> 00:08:12.312\nSo they can take that password and\nthen really just kind of guess with other\n\n152\n00:08:12.312 --> 00:08:16.731\naccounts or even use it as a pivot point\nto try to break into another system.\n\n153\n00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:21.285\n&gt;&gt; And there's no doubt that all of these\nessentially lead to bad ways that we're\n\n154\n00:08:21.285 --> 00:08:24.940\nmismanaging user accounts and\npasswords in that way.\n\n155\n00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.760\nSo whether it's because we delegate it and\n\n156\n00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.489\nsomebody else took advantage of\nthe options that were there, or\n\n157\n00:08:29.489 --> 00:08:33.043\nwhether we're just bad at remembering\npasswords, whatever it might be, right?\n\n158\n00:08:33.043 --> 00:08:34.226\nBad at resetting them and\n\n159\n00:08:34.226 --> 00:08:38.220\nbad at actually understanding the options\nbefore us we need to do better.\n\n160\n00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.770\nSo when we reset password there is one of\nthese unusual things that we have to think\n\n161\n00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.050\nabout, we really don't wanna reset it to\na very common password because of what\n\n162\n00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.340\nCherokee just said.\n\n163\n00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.420\nWe also don't wanna make sure that\nthat password never expires because\n\n164\n00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.470\nwe're giving the advantage\nnow to the attacker, right?\n\n165\n00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.091\nSo that's something that\nwe don't want to do,\n\n166\n00:08:55.091 --> 00:08:59.163\nwe also don't want the user to just\nsimply go okay they reset my password.\n\n167\n00:08:59.163 --> 00:09:01.523\nLet me see if I can use\nthe exact same password again.\n\n168\n00:09:01.523 --> 00:09:03.540\nThat's something we\ndon't wanna do as well.\n\n169\n00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.125\nThe great thing is normally this\ndoesn't happen too often because\n\n170\n00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:09.420\nit's controlled inside of\nsomething called group policy\n\n171\n00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.860\nwhich we'll be getting to\nlater on in this show.\n\n172\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.130\nBut overall though Is something\nthat we have to consider.\n\n173\n00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.440\nSo, when we start to do that we need to\nunderstand where we go to reset those\n\n174\n00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.750\npolicies, and we need to know\nwhat we can do about this idea\n\n175\n00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.550\ninstead of using the same\nexact password again.\n\n176\n00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:25.920\nSo, let's go ahead and\n\n177\n00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.310\ntake a look inside of our active\ndirectory users and computers.\n\n178\n00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.200\nI went ahead and\npulled it up right here on my machine, so\n\n179\n00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.570\nthat we can take a look and\nwe can see up here at the very top.\n\n180\n00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.110\nIn the Active Directory Users and\nComputers.\n\n181\n00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.550\nI am logged on remotely to do this.\n\n182\n00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:45.470\nSo as soon as I did that, I went into\nmy Windows administrative tools.\n\n183\n00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.910\nAnd when I clicked on it,\nit asked me for credentials and\n\n184\n00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.530\nit popped it up right here.\n\n185\n00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.356\nSo now I'm remotely connected\nin the way that I should be,\n\n186\n00:09:52.356 --> 00:09:55.021\nnot using Remote Desktop\ninto the domain controller.\n\n187\n00:09:55.021 --> 00:10:00.133\nBut everything is actually where I want\nit to be, so if I want to go ahead and\n\n188\n00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:03.850\nreset a user's password,\nwell I can pick somebody.\n\n189\n00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:08.850\nSo let's pick for example right here,\nlet's just say Han Solo here.\n\n190\n00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.001\nSo if I select that, it's simple.\n\n191\n00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:14.710\nI reset that particular password,\nand there we go.\n\n192\n00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:18.350\nWe can go ahead and set his new password.\n\n193\n00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.040\nThat's available to doing that.\n\n194\n00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:21.910\nSo there it is.\n\n195\n00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:26.772\nI set up my password and\nnow I start to see something right away.\n\n196\n00:10:26.772 --> 00:10:30.733\nNow the great thing is most people will\nactually understand in a lab environment\n\n197\n00:10:30.733 --> 00:10:33.350\nwe don't tend to set\nvery complex passwords.\n\n198\n00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.028\nBut in a production environment whatever\nyou set this to right it should be\n\n199\n00:10:37.028 --> 00:10:41.203\ndifferent it should be something that we\ndon't want it to be easily guessed at all.\n\n200\n00:10:41.203 --> 00:10:44.326\nIt's something that we wanna make sure\nthat we follow whatever the security\n\n201\n00:10:44.326 --> 00:10:46.960\npolicy is to make sure\nthat this doesn't happen.\n\n202\n00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:52.520\nWe wanna verify also that the user must\nchange his password at next login as well.\n\n203\n00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:57.040\nAnd if the account, let me move that over,\nif the account is actually locked,\n\n204\n00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.653\nwe of course want to\nunlock the user account.\n\n205\n00:10:59.653 --> 00:11:01.780\nAnd then they're off and ready to go.\n\n206\n00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.610\nNow it may be that you\nchoose to keep it locked,\n\n207\n00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:08.520\nbecause the user is really that\nbad at not being able to do this.\n\n208\n00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:13.468\nBut overall, though, it's just as simple\nto reset a particular password, and\n\n209\n00:11:13.468 --> 00:11:15.741\nthat's what we actually have to do.\n\n210\n00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:19.054\nNow, the big thing that we can\ndo as the administrator, though,\n\n211\n00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:22.800\nis really to come up with something\nthat is relatively unique.\n\n212\n00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.560\nFor this idea of these new passwords but\n\n213\n00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.910\nit also requires them that the user be\nable to type those password in too.\n\n214\n00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:35.020\nSo the recommendation here, just like\nit has been as password policies have\n\n215\n00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.580\ncontinued to change,\nis no longer just about complexity, right?\n\n216\n00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.440\nIt's about the idea of\nthe length of it as well.\n\n217\n00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.710\nSo remember that length also includes\nspaces, as well as everything else.\n\n218\n00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.950\nSo you may wanna come up\nwith let's say a line,\n\n219\n00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.663\nof something that you actually do know and\nunderstand.\n\n220\n00:11:50.663 --> 00:11:55.420\nOr a question of some sort, that you may\nalso want to be able to type in here.\n\n221\n00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.020\nAnd that way they'll say,\nis that my actual password?\n\n222\n00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.152\nNo that's the password that's gonna\nallow you to create your own password.\n\n223\n00:12:01.152 --> 00:12:05.460\nBut that way you change this on a regular\nbasis is something they're not gonna be\n\n224\n00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.014\nable to guess very quickly.\n\n225\n00:12:07.014 --> 00:12:09.050\nAnd you don't really want\neverybody to be able to know.\n\n226\n00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:13.640\nSo if you can making these things unique\nI know it sounds silly at times it sounds\n\n227\n00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.210\nadministrative nightmare.\n\n228\n00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:19.020\nBut this is something that you have to\nkind of figure out through your policy and\n\n229\n00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.473\nthe way that you do this okay?\n\n230\n00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:23.403\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie we may already\nbe familiar with this because\n\n231\n00:12:23.403 --> 00:12:27.170\na lot companies are adopting this\nprinciple even for their profiles.\n\n232\n00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:30.490\nLike if you get locked out of your\nbank account or something like that.\n\n233\n00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:31.680\nSo they're saying hey let me go ahead and\n\n234\n00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.000\nsend you this one-time password\nthat will go ahead and expire.\n\n235\n00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.430\nThey attach TTL on it so that they just\nkind of make sure that it doesn't become\n\n236\n00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:46.060\nstale, stuck in your inbox or maybe\nget intercepted, something like that.\n\n237\n00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.800\n&gt;&gt; That's definitely a good point to make,\nright?\n\n238\n00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.720\nThe very fact is, if you can,\nrandomly generated characters,\n\n239\n00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.500\na long length of them,\nis probably just as good as anything else.\n\n240\n00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.170\nBut it does require you to\novercome that hurdle, and\n\n241\n00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.334\nthat challenge of making sure\nthat the end user can type it in.\n\n242\n00:13:01.334 --> 00:13:04.930\nAnd that's where people kind of\nget a little bit more confused.\n\n243\n00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.216\nBut when you make it that complex,\nyou just tell them,\n\n244\n00:13:07.216 --> 00:13:09.461\nmake sure you type it in one\nletter at a time to do this.\n\n245\n00:13:09.461 --> 00:13:13.372\nAnd then you set the group policy, and\nthe policy password the way that you,\n\n246\n00:13:13.372 --> 00:13:16.630\nor that password policy, excuse me,\nthe way that you want to.\n\n247\n00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.473\nFor the complexity levels that you have.\n\n248\n00:13:18.473 --> 00:13:23.337\nNow, the other thing, of course then, is\neven though we can do that one account at\n\n249\n00:13:23.337 --> 00:13:27.090\na time, you may also end up doing\nthis in PowerShell, as well.\n\n250\n00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.180\nAnd we're gonna show you\nan example of that, right now.\n\n251\n00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.011\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my machine too.\n\n252\n00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:36.540\nSo here it is, I brought up\nthe actual PowerShell prompt, and\n\n253\n00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:41.360\nI am able to, from right here,\nto go ahead and do this as well.\n\n254\n00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.470\nYou launch it in the administrative\nmode and then you're ready to go.\n\n255\n00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:51.955\nSo at this point I'm going to type in\nSet AD account and there's oops too many,\n\n256\n00:13:51.955 --> 00:13:56.493\nso this's where this one's\na little bit longer here.\n\n257\n00:13:56.493 --> 00:13:58.496\nAD account password and\n\n258\n00:13:58.496 --> 00:14:03.914\nI'm gonna choose the identity of\nwho this actually needs to be.\n\n259\n00:14:03.914 --> 00:14:07.087\nSo this one I chose Megan here.\n\n260\n00:14:07.087 --> 00:14:08.690\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna pick on Megan a little bit.\n\n261\n00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:10.872\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I'm gonna pick on Megan.\n\n262\n00:14:10.872 --> 00:14:13.756\nThen we're do a Reset.\n\n263\n00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:20.141\nThen we're gonna do a New Password.\n\n264\n00:14:20.141 --> 00:14:23.404\nNow here I have to convert this to\nsomething that's actually gonna be\n\n265\n00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:24.651\na little bit more secure.\n\n266\n00:14:24.651 --> 00:14:28.062\nSo inside of the parentheses\ntelling it to do this first.\n\n267\n00:14:28.062 --> 00:14:35.700\nI'm gonna do a ConvertTo-SecureString,\nLet me make sure I do that.\n\n268\n00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:41.270\nAnd then as plain text here so\n\n269\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:45.210\nwhat is it that I'm gonna have Megan\ntype in in the very first time.\n\n270\n00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.488\nI'm gonna just use a simple question here.\n\n271\n00:14:47.488 --> 00:14:53.809\nWhat is 255.255.255.240.\n\n272\n00:14:53.809 --> 00:14:57.390\nSo there it is I actually made\nit a little bit more complex.\n\n273\n00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.532\nNow, I'm not saying that\nyou have to do this.\n\n274\n00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:03.467\nBut being able to actually type it out\nin the form of a question, and I don't\n\n275\n00:15:03.467 --> 00:15:07.610\nhave a question mark here at the end, but\nbeing able to do something like this.\n\n276\n00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:12.160\nLet me make sure I close that\noff with the quotes here.\n\n277\n00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.330\nThen I'm gonna issue a force command\n\n278\n00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:20.430\nthis should allow me set if I actually did\nidentify Megan's account correctly here.\n\n279\n00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.272\nIt was a while ago since\nI created this account.\n\n280\n00:15:22.272 --> 00:15:26.067\nBut we'll actually know right oops\nit's actually showing me that\n\n281\n00:15:26.067 --> 00:15:28.651\nthere may be something\nelse I need to do here.\n\n282\n00:15:28.651 --> 00:15:29.810\nOops, hold on.\n\n283\n00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.580\nForce, I forgot to close\noff the parentheses.\n\n284\n00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.090\nThat was my fault.\n\n285\n00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:37.850\nSo it actually realized that.\n\n286\n00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.572\nSo at the very end I was like, why is it\nstill saying that I'm still typing here?\n\n287\n00:15:41.572 --> 00:15:45.545\nBut I forgot to close off the parenthesis\nfrom the ConvertTo command.\n\n288\n00:15:45.545 --> 00:15:48.535\nAnd then when I press Enter,\neverything is now done.\n\n289\n00:15:48.535 --> 00:15:51.644\nAnd now we actually have\nreset Megan's password.\n\n290\n00:15:51.644 --> 00:15:55.478\nSo, if Megan already had a password\nwhere she was saying hey,\n\n291\n00:15:55.478 --> 00:15:58.910\nI forgot the password,\ncan you reset it for me?\n\n292\n00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.300\nWe definitely can.\n\n293\n00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.020\nBut remember, make sure that\nthe new password that you set\n\n294\n00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.650\nis actually going to be something here.\n\n295\n00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.930\nAnd then of course you can even\nset the command to say hey,\n\n296\n00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:12.650\nmake sure that she changes the password\non the next login as well.\n\n297\n00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.550\nSo, fairly simple, but\n\n298\n00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:18.600\nit is something that we do need to\nconsider as we move forward through here.\n\n299\n00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.040\nSo, not the most complex\nthing we'll ever do, but\n\n300\n00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.750\nit is something we have to\nthink about as we continue on.\n\n301\n00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:28.950\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, in a previous episode you\nmentioned a tactic that an attacker may\n\n302\n00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:34.100\nuse to gain a little window of\nopportunity, so to speak, would be to go\n\n303\n00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:39.470\nahead and disable or lockout a user\nfrom being able to enter their password.\n\n304\n00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.710\nSo, Ronnie, how does that happen?\n\n305\n00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:43.780\nAnd how many times would that\nattacker have to go ahead and\n\n306\n00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:48.110\nenter in the incorrect password\nbefore that user was locked out?\n\n307\n00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:52.390\n&gt;&gt; A user can be locked down\nrelatively easily, by default,\n\n308\n00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.300\nespecially in the server environments.\n\n309\n00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.480\nUsually when the combination of your\nusername and password entered into\n\n310\n00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:03.860\na domain join machine of five times, that\nwill end up locking out a particular user.\n\n311\n00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.610\nSo, let's go back over.\n\n312\n00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:10.006\nI'm gonna use this server now, so\nI've just switched our environment here.\n\n313\n00:17:10.006 --> 00:17:14.310\nAll right, so here we go and\nlet's go ahead and click on another user.\n\n314\n00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:17.980\nSo from here, I'm trying to think\nof who I wanna pick on now.\n\n315\n00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.490\nWe'll do Wes Bryan.\n\n316\n00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:21.020\nWhy not?\n\n317\n00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.920\nWe'll do Wes Bryan here.\n\n318\n00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.530\nSo if I just typed in passwords,\n\n319\n00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:29.125\nnotice that first instance\nof whatever I did here.\n\n320\n00:17:29.125 --> 00:17:31.949\nThe username and\npassword is incorrect, try again.\n\n321\n00:17:31.949 --> 00:17:34.490\nI think this is gonna be\nmy third time I believe.\n\n322\n00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.530\nAnd then that was the fourth time.\n\n323\n00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:38.030\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n324\n00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:44.010\n&gt;&gt; And now you can see where it now tells\nyou the referenced account is currently\n\n325\n00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:48.080\nlocked out and may not be logged onto.\n\n326\n00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.530\nSo, now you actually have this\nissue where somebody is doing that,\n\n327\n00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.500\nsomebody is able to\ntake advantage of that.\n\n328\n00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.960\nFor us to be able to\nidentify locked out accounts\n\n329\n00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.910\nis something that we also want\nto be able to do as well.\n\n330\n00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:06.682\nSo, if I type in Search-ADAccount here,\n\n331\n00:18:06.682 --> 00:18:09.863\nthen I do a -lockedout, and\n\n332\n00:18:09.863 --> 00:18:15.312\nyou'll end up seeing,\nthere's two accounts.\n\n333\n00:18:15.312 --> 00:18:19.657\nSo earlier, here it is, Cherokee\n&gt;&gt; Shame shame Cherokee\n\n334\n00:18:19.657 --> 00:18:20.751\n&gt;&gt; Typing their password wrong,\n\n335\n00:18:20.751 --> 00:18:23.440\nand then here's the one that we just did\nright here which tells you that it was\n\n336\n00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.254\nactually locked out.\n\n337\n00:18:24.254 --> 00:18:28.073\nAnd of course you can see there is\nthe actual attribute that you're actually\n\n338\n00:18:28.073 --> 00:18:30.950\ntaking a look at, where it's locked out.\n\n339\n00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:35.700\nSo, being able to do something like\nthat is actually fairly easy for\n\n340\n00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.270\na new user, especially on your network.\n\n341\n00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:41.830\nNow, unlocking accounts is\nnot exactly difficult either.\n\n342\n00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:46.820\nIf you go into the Active Directory Users\nand Computers here, okay.\n\n343\n00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:50.330\nLet's select, let's see,\nI want to find Cherokee.\n\n344\n00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.500\nCherokee is actually\nin the publicity here.\n\n345\n00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.976\nAnd if I right-click and\ngo to properties I think and the account,\n\n346\n00:18:58.976 --> 00:19:04.707\nnow you'll actually see the difference\nwhere instead of it saying that hey,\n\n347\n00:19:04.707 --> 00:19:07.283\ndo you want to unlock the account?\n\n348\n00:19:07.283 --> 00:19:08.403\nNotice that it says,\n\n349\n00:19:08.403 --> 00:19:12.710\nthis account is currently locked out on\nthe Active Directory Domain Controller.\n\n350\n00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:19.290\nI simply put a check mark here and\nthen I can click apply and click okay.\n\n351\n00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:22.260\nAnd now we are off and we are ready to go.\n\n352\n00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.310\nNow, this is not the only place,\n\n353\n00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.840\nanother episode in which we also talked\nabout the Active Directory here.\n\n354\n00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:33.050\nWe also pulled up what we call the Active\nDirectory Administration Center, or\n\n355\n00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:36.580\nAdministrative Center, and\nwe can do this directly from here as well.\n\n356\n00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:43.050\nSo, if I now go into the road crew where\nI know that actually, where is Wes?\n\n357\n00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.680\nHe is not in the road crew?\n\n358\n00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.080\n&gt;&gt; He's not part of the cool kids club?\n\n359\n00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.160\n&gt;&gt; Apparently,\nhe's not part of the cool kids club here.\n\n360\n00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.530\nSo where did I put him?\n\n361\n00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.730\nIs he in manager?\n\n362\n00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:54.120\nThere he is, look,\nhe's actually a manager.\n\n363\n00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.790\nVery tough there.\n\n364\n00:19:55.790 --> 00:20:00.880\nSo, if I right-click on his, notice that\nI can do it directly from here as well.\n\n365\n00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.180\nUnlocking the actual user account.\n\n366\n00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.830\nSo, not very difficult.\n\n367\n00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.570\nGetting used to working in\nthis administrative center\n\n368\n00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.840\nis probably going to become more\nuseful to you as time goes on.\n\n369\n00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.690\nBecause as you start integrating more with\ncloud environments, such as Office 365,\n\n370\n00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.530\nthey're probably gonna\nwant you working in here\n\n371\n00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:21.290\nmore often than messing around with\nthe Active Directory Users and Computers.\n\n372\n00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.676\nSo, you're gonna actually see\ninformation like that and\n\n373\n00:20:24.676 --> 00:20:29.302\nthis is probably the ones that you really\ndo want to pay attention to as well, but\n\n374\n00:20:29.302 --> 00:20:30.981\neasy enough to be able to do.\n\n375\n00:20:30.981 --> 00:20:34.900\nNow, can this be done\nfrom PowerShell as well?\n\n376\n00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.910\nWell, of course it can be\ndone from PowerShell and\n\n377\n00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:43.710\nthat is also a key component for\nus as we begin to look and see here.\n\n378\n00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.490\nSo, the bad thing is I\nthink I just unlocked.\n\n379\n00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:50.510\nActually I didn't unlock Wes's account,\nI just want you, I knew I left one here.\n\n380\n00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:55.731\nSo, if I want to unlock\nthe AD account here,\n\n381\n00:20:55.731 --> 00:20:58.420\nI now do the identity.\n\n382\n00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.360\nAnd that was WBrian for right here.\n\n383\n00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:06.606\nAnd now we can see, and\n\n384\n00:21:06.606 --> 00:21:11.470\nif I just hit my up arrow a few times to\nget back to searching for lock out ones.\n\n385\n00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.770\nNow notice that it's not\nfinding any of them locked out.\n\n386\n00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:18.060\nSo, it's fairly easy to be able to do.\n\n387\n00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.292\nYou can see why this is quicker\ninstead of you having to search.\n\n388\n00:21:21.292 --> 00:21:23.396\nIt's still a number of clicks and\n\n389\n00:21:23.396 --> 00:21:28.208\ngetting either the Active Directory\nAdministration Center or the users and\n\n390\n00:21:28.208 --> 00:21:32.590\ncomputers is part of what we have\nto be able to do as well, okay?\n\n391\n00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:38.110\nSo, usually on terms of management, these\nare kind of two of the big things, right?\n\n392\n00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.230\nUnlocking accounts that get\nlocked out accidentally,\n\n393\n00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.570\nsomebody of course\nforgetting their password.\n\n394\n00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:47.460\nKind of a daily task,\nespecially in a larger organization.\n\n395\n00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.280\n&gt;&gt; Very common Ronnie.\n\n396\n00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.900\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Thank for showing us that.\n\n397\n00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:50.416\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n398\n00:21:50.416 --> 00:21:53.622\nnow that means we actually have one\nother topic that we need to talk about.\n\n399\n00:21:53.622 --> 00:21:58.150\nAnd this is kind of an unusual one because\nmost of us don't think about this idea.\n\n400\n00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:03.400\nBut inside of the Windows Server 101 book,\nBrian, Brings up the idea\n\n401\n00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:08.770\nof what we call stale accounts and being\nable to manage stale accounts as well.\n\n402\n00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:12.330\nWell, the question is well, what's here\nthat we actually have to worry about?\n\n403\n00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:17.280\n&gt;&gt; Maybe those accounts are being\nused if they are sitting inactive,\n\n404\n00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.160\njust kind of adding as\npotential vulnerabilities.\n\n405\n00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.361\nBut Ronnie,\nwho's to determine what stale is?\n\n406\n00:22:23.361 --> 00:22:25.830\nWhat are we talking about\nas far as like a duration?\n\n407\n00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.387\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you start taking a look\nat the idea of stale accounts,\n\n408\n00:22:28.387 --> 00:22:30.294\nlet's just make sure we\nunderstand what it is and\n\n409\n00:22:30.294 --> 00:22:32.403\nwe'll talk about when we\nconsider something stale.\n\n410\n00:22:32.403 --> 00:22:33.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's when you do\n\n411\n00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:36.650\nhave accounts that are sitting there,\nbut nobody is logging into them.\n\n412\n00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:40.360\nSo, that means that more than likely\nthere's gonna be a policy that's gonna be\n\n413\n00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:45.220\nset that says look, after so many days\nof nobody's logging in that account,\n\n414\n00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:49.740\nthey're probably fired and we forgot to\nremove them or whatever else it might be.\n\n415\n00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.950\nThey may be on a leave of some sort,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n416\n00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:57.220\nSo in that sense, you want to be\nable to know when they're stale and\n\n417\n00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.370\nthen what can we do about them as well.\n\n418\n00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:04.990\nSo the rule of thumb, which for us doesn't\nmean it's actually written in stone,\n\n419\n00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:08.210\nit means normally the guideline\nis relatively simple here.\n\n420\n00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.590\nWhen an account probably hasn't\nbeen used in about 30 days,\n\n421\n00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:14.460\nit's probably on the verge\nof what we call stale, okay?\n\n422\n00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.660\nIf it's 60 days, it's probably\nstarting to rot at that point.\n\n423\n00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.250\nIf it's 90 days,\nit's beyond rotten at that point and\n\n424\n00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:22.620\nit's probably not worth much.\n\n425\n00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.650\nNo, no way, okay?\n\n426\n00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:26.570\nSo, every organization will\nbe a little bit different.\n\n427\n00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:31.980\nSo, follow whatever the policy is inside\nof your organization, but usually 30 days.\n\n428\n00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:36.720\nIf nobody's logged in for\na month on that, inside of your domain,\n\n429\n00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.900\nyou got to kind of ask that question.\n\n430\n00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.770\nWhy do they even have an account?\n\n431\n00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:45.532\nDon't get me wrong, there are people\nthat do take leave of absences.\n\n432\n00:23:45.532 --> 00:23:49.743\nThere are for example, professors\nthat may go on sabbatical at times,\n\n433\n00:23:49.743 --> 00:23:52.773\nwhere they're not gonna be there for\na whole year.\n\n434\n00:23:52.773 --> 00:23:55.114\nBut they're not actually logging in to,\nAnything at work.\n\n435\n00:23:55.114 --> 00:23:57.962\nThey're actually on a sabbatical\nwhere they're not going to be around.\n\n436\n00:23:57.962 --> 00:24:02.221\nLeaving those types of accounts active and\nopen, means somebody can take advantage of\n\n437\n00:24:02.221 --> 00:24:06.010\nthose types of accounts as well, and\nthat's something we don't want to do,\n\n438\n00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:10.130\nbecause they become prime targets,\nof course, for malicious activity.\n\n439\n00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:14.120\nSo we want to make sure that we start\nto manage them a little bit better.\n\n440\n00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:20.303\nSo if I gave you a time period, it means\nthat you might set a scheduled task or\n\n441\n00:24:20.303 --> 00:24:24.500\nyou might actually set a calendar reminder\nat least, that says, hey, check for\n\n442\n00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.710\nstale accounts every 45 days or\nwhatever it might be and\n\n443\n00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:31.690\nset something that actually says let's\nactually go through and do this.\n\n444\n00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:35.220\nSo being sure that you check for\nthese is actually going to be key as well.\n\n445\n00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.780\nLet's take a look at it through\nActive Directory users and\n\n446\n00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.960\nComputers first as we begin\nto take a look as well, okay?\n\n447\n00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.420\nNow to be able to find stale\naccounts at this point,\n\n448\n00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:50.920\nwhat we can do here is that if you are in\nthe Active Directory Users' computers,\n\n449\n00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:56.440\nyou want to go up to the actual domain,\nwhich is right here, okay?\n\n450\n00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.600\nAnd then I can right click on\nthat domain and select Find.\n\n451\n00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:06.730\nNow when I select Find, it's under here\nthat you may actually choose to do,\n\n452\n00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.360\nlet me see here,\nI wanna do a common query.\n\n453\n00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.352\nMake sure I'm actually telling you right.\n\n454\n00:25:12.352 --> 00:25:15.640\nAnd now,\nyou start to see some other things too.\n\n455\n00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:21.780\nNotice this last option where it says\nsince days logged in, last logged in.\n\n456\n00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:26.810\nSo this is where you can go through and\ninstead of you having to define all this,\n\n457\n00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:30.560\nyou select let's say 30 days or\nso if you haven't logged in.\n\n458\n00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.470\nTell it to find who hasn't\nlogged in in those 30 days.\n\n459\n00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:38.130\nSo this will give you that option to\nbe able to find those accounts and\n\n460\n00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.120\nthat's a manual option for us.\n\n461\n00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.520\nBut it does help us to be\nable to do that as well.\n\n462\n00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.600\nSo using something like this,\nit will at least help you identify that.\n\n463\n00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.220\nThen of course, the process may be,\n\n464\n00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.300\ndepending on your security policy,\nwhere you delete those accounts.\n\n465\n00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.370\nNormally not.\n\n466\n00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.490\nMore than likely,\nwe're probably going to disable them.\n\n467\n00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:00.710\nAnd, of course, that means you're gonna\ncontact whoever the supervisors are and\n\n468\n00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:03.700\nsay, hey,\nis this account still active or valid or\n\n469\n00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.970\nwhy hasn't this person\nlogged in in 30 days,\n\n470\n00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:10.060\nor whether it might be that's something\nyou want to be able to do it as well.\n\n471\n00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.000\nNow, the same thing is\ntrue then in PowerShell.\n\n472\n00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.830\nI'm not gonna worry about\nthe PowerShell so much right now.\n\n473\n00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:18.650\nYou will find, let's say on a command\nthat's similar in PowerShell,\n\n474\n00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:21.000\nthat you could run and do the same thing.\n\n475\n00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000\nCheck out Brian's book once\nagain in this chapter and\n\n476\n00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.240\nyou'll find that command\nright there as well.\n\n477\n00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.100\nSetting up these days,\n\n478\n00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:33.140\nthe limitation that you have right here in\nthis, is you can't type in your number.\n\n479\n00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.360\nSo let's say days since logged in.\n\n480\n00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.050\nCherokee, what if I\nwanted it to be 45 days?\n\n481\n00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:38.910\nI can't change that.\n\n482\n00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.616\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you've got 30 to 60 and so\n\n483\n00:26:40.616 --> 00:26:43.050\nmaybe that's when PowerShell\nwould be a good tool.\n\n484\n00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:45.530\nSo I could really specify\nthat 45 day limit.\n\n485\n00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:46.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo\n\n486\n00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:47.600\nthat's where PowerShell\nwould help you out.\n\n487\n00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.520\nIf your security policy says no.\n\n488\n00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.723\nWe're gonna make it six weeks,\nwhich is gonna be seven times six.\n\n489\n00:26:53.723 --> 00:26:54.670\nYeah, that would work.\n\n490\n00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:56.235\nThat actually works, 42 days.\n\n491\n00:26:56.235 --> 00:26:58.570\n[LAUGH] You can even do that.\n\n492\n00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:01.660\nWhereas something like that, but that\nwould only be done through the PowerShell.\n\n493\n00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.750\nAnd it's the same option that\nyou have available to you\n\n494\n00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.190\nto be able to find that when you do it.\n\n495\n00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:12.040\nNow normally, of course, once you disable\nit the recommended practice is don't\n\n496\n00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:16.430\njust disable it, because people begin\nto wonder why is this account disabled?\n\n497\n00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.240\nAlways add a description\non why you disabled it.\n\n498\n00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.300\nIt may be that you found stale user or\n\n499\n00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:27.390\nstale account here not logged in since\nthis and you disabled it on this day.\n\n500\n00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:31.230\nThat way it helps people that\nare actually paying attention there,\n\n501\n00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:34.480\nto figure out why instead of just\nenabling all these accounts,\n\n502\n00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.060\nthey don't need to be\ndisabled at this point.\n\n503\n00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.520\nThis person still works here.\n\n504\n00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.670\nWell make sure you add\nsomething in there as well.\n\n505\n00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.130\nDon't forget special use cases too.\n\n506\n00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:47.970\nSomebody that may go on maternity leave\nthat may not be checking as well.\n\n507\n00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:51.230\nOr they may be a reservist that's\njust been called up to active duty.\n\n508\n00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:55.850\nAll these things are considerations that\nwe may also have to consider as well.\n\n509\n00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.550\nNow even though I said\nthat was the last thing,\n\n510\n00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:02.600\nI just remembered as I looked down here,\nwe need to talk about deleting accounts.\n\n511\n00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:06.720\nNow, Cherokee, do you know when\nyou should delete an account?\n\n512\n00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.530\n&gt;&gt; I would say following\nyour companies policy.\n\n513\n00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:13.490\nSo if you're by default let's\nsay we go ahead and set,\n\n514\n00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:18.470\nmaybe it's our company's policy to\ndisable that account after 45 days and\n\n515\n00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.210\nthen delete the account after 90 days.\n\n516\n00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:24.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you follow the actually\npolicy that's in place, and\n\n517\n00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.730\nthat's going to be the key for you.\n\n518\n00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:29.721\nSo some places will have it\nwhere it's a very strict policy,\n\n519\n00:28:29.721 --> 00:28:31.666\nwhere you go through and find all that.\n\n520\n00:28:31.666 --> 00:28:34.060\nAnd they set it up in that way, too.\n\n521\n00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.960\nNow if you're actually kind of one\nof the two people that's doing it,\n\n522\n00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.590\nyou might find out something\na little bit differently.\n\n523\n00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:42.210\nFor example, like here,\nI've worked with everybody at ITProTV,\n\n524\n00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:46.490\nat least right at the beginning,\nfor probably a decade now.\n\n525\n00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:50.360\nNow, that was before ITProTV came along,\nbut for a decade.\n\n526\n00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.360\nAnd I found out something.\n\n527\n00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:57.630\nThat at least from the perspective of the\nones that have actually been the network\n\n528\n00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:02.010\nadministrators, to doing all this,\nthat we have never deleted an account.\n\n529\n00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:03.710\nIt didn't matter how many people do it.\n\n530\n00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:08.620\nWe simply disable it, and we move them\noff to another OU that just says,\n\n531\n00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.000\ndisabled accounts, is what we do.\n\n532\n00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.950\nAnd it's not that we have a fear of doing\nit, but we also wanna make sure that\n\n533\n00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:18.211\nif anybody ever questions whether or\nnot we've had it there,\n\n534\n00:29:18.211 --> 00:29:22.540\nits' actually there and available and\nit's not like they were never in existence\n\n535\n00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:26.209\ninside of what we had available to us,\nso being able to disable that.\n\n536\n00:29:26.209 --> 00:29:28.550\nSo some, why can't I say it?\n\n537\n00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:31.360\nSome places then will\nhave you delete them.\n\n538\n00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.104\nSome places will do\nexactly like what we do.\n\n539\n00:29:33.104 --> 00:29:34.480\nWe just don't delete them.\n\n540\n00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:38.820\nWe just simply disable them, move them off\nto an OU that we're not gonna really use.\n\n541\n00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.980\nAnd we also make sure that we\nput a policy on them that says,\n\n542\n00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.160\nyou have access to nothing,\nis what we also do as well.\n\n543\n00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.490\n&gt;&gt; So you bring up a good point, Ronnie.\n\n544\n00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:49.890\nBecause it's completely discretionary,\nlike we said of that company.\n\n545\n00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.320\nBut just keep in mind,\nwe've talked about this before,\n\n546\n00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.630\nthe particular security identifiers\nthat are attached with that object in\n\n547\n00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:00.460\nActive Directory cannot be recreated, even\nif, let's say, I deleted Ronnie's account.\n\n548\n00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.590\nAnd his username was Ronnie Wong.\n\n549\n00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:04.550\nAnd I deleted him and I'm like, oops, and\n\n550\n00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:06.907\nthen I'll just recreate\nhim in Active Directory.\n\n551\n00:30:06.907 --> 00:30:10.590\nAnd that's,\nit's really it's a one way street there.\n\n552\n00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.180\nSo it's not like I can ever\nget that account back.\n\n553\n00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.430\nSo it really just depends\non your organization.\n\n554\n00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:16.730\n&gt;&gt; It really does, but\n\n555\n00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:19.510\nit is something that we definitely\nwant to pay attention to.\n\n556\n00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.870\nYou have some forgiveness a little bit,\nright.\n\n557\n00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:25.390\nThere's that Active Directory recycle\nbin that's actually there today.\n\n558\n00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:28.860\nBut at the same time, its' something\ninstead, that what you'll see today,\n\n559\n00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.120\nto prevent from accidental deletions,\njust like what Cherokee was talking about,\n\n560\n00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.060\nyou have that little check mark that says,\n\n561\n00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.990\nprevent this object from\nbeing deleted accidentally.\n\n562\n00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:39.430\nAnd that's something that\napparently has happened so\n\n563\n00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:43.850\noften that Microsoft said, we need to\ninclude that into Active Directory now.\n\n564\n00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:44.830\nSo just take a look at it.\n\n565\n00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.000\nCan you do it in Power Shell?\n\n566\n00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:46.620\nYes.\n\n567\n00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.460\nDefinitely.\n\n568\n00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.390\nCan you do this inside of\nthe Active Directory user computers?\n\n569\n00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:51.010\nYes.\n\n570\n00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:54.410\nCan you do this inside of\nActive Directory Administration Center?\n\n571\n00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:55.560\nAbsolutely.\n\n572\n00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.400\nAll these are fairly simple things for\n\n573\n00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.360\nus to do, but don't do them\nunless you actually do have clear\n\n574\n00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:06.960\npolicy guiding you to do any one of those\nthings, especially on deleting accounts.\n\n575\n00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.703\nBecause messing with somebody's\nsecurity identifier,\n\n576\n00:31:10.703 --> 00:31:15.831\nit can disconnect everything, that\nwhatever they actually needed, is gone.\n\n577\n00:31:15.831 --> 00:31:17.170\nIf it's encrypted, it's gone.\n\n578\n00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:18.740\nYou're just kind of in trouble.\n\n579\n00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.740\nSo it's not something we\nwould definitely want to do.\n\n580\n00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:24.600\nBut those are some of the common,\neveryday types of tasks that we'll\n\n581\n00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.660\nend up seeing when we start managing\nuser accounts in Active Directory.\n\n582\n00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.480\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie, thank you for\nsharing those with us.\n\n583\n00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:33.380\nHowever, I have a feeling we're not quite\nfinished with Active Directory yet.\n\n584\n00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.950\nSo ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned for\nmore information headed your way.\n\n585\n00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:38.310\nThis show, we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n586\n00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:40.040\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n587\n00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:40.980\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n588\n00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.975\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n589\n00:31:43.975 -->

00:00:08.191\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:10.845\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:15.568\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Server 101 series,\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:15.568 --> 00:00:16.823\nIn this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:16.823 --> 00:00:22.022\nwe'll be taking a look at creating\nActive Directory computer accounts.\n\n8\n00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.695\nWith us today back in studios we have Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:25.957\nRonnie Wong, thank you for\njoining us today Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:25.957 --> 00:00:29.640\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back\nas we continue on taking a look at\n\n11\n00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.230\nthe idea of computer accounts today.\n\n12\n00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.080\nAnd if you're watching this episode,\n\n13\n00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.670\nyou probably did see us in previous Active\nDirectory episodes where we talked about\n\n14\n00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.160\nof course creating user accounts\nas well as managing user accounts.\n\n15\n00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.400\nAnd you're probably wondering,\nlike I am at times like,\n\n16\n00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.370\nwhy did I just jump right into\nmanaging computer accounts?\n\n17\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.950\nYou didn't talk about creating\ncomputer accounts, and then do this?\n\n18\n00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.030\nAnd that's because we're\ncombining it all into one show.\n\n19\n00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.912\nSo I probably could have called it\nCreating and Managing Computer Accounts,\n\n20\n00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:00.314\nbut way too long of a name for\nActive Directory.\n\n21\n00:01:00.314 --> 00:01:03.030\nBut that's what we're jumping into,\nin this episode.\n\n22\n00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.760\nIs that ability, not only to create\ncomputer accounts in Active Directory, but\n\n23\n00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.600\nalso to manage them a way that\nwe actually need to, right?\n\n24\n00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.363\nEvery server administrator,\n\n25\n00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:16.358\none of the tasks that you're gonna\nend up doing daily, a lot of times,\n\n26\n00:01:16.358 --> 00:01:20.720\nis managing computer accounts throughout\nyour Active Directory network.\n\n27\n00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.557\nSame thing with of course with user\naccounts, but usually you deal with those\n\n28\n00:01:24.557 --> 00:01:27.970\na little bit more often than you\ndo with the computer accounts.\n\n29\n00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.082\nBut we do need to know some of\nthe different tasks and we have to\n\n30\n00:01:31.082 --> 00:01:35.120\nactually develop our skill set there\nwith managing these computer accounts.\n\n31\n00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.820\nAnd that's what we wanna do today.\n\n32\n00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.450\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie,\nthroughout this series so far,\n\n33\n00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.150\nyou've shown us different ways to\nexecute certain functions or tasks.\n\n34\n00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.460\nWhen we're talking about creating these\nuser accounts, what options do we have?\n\n35\n00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.840\n&gt;&gt; Well, when it comes down to\nActive Directory computer accounts,\n\n36\n00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.180\nyou really have two ways that\nyou're gonna create that entry or\n\n37\n00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.780\nthat object inside of Active Directory.\n\n38\n00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.650\nOne is, well, probably the most common\nway, okay, is that when you end up taking\n\n39\n00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.700\na computer and\nyou make it a part of Active Directory.\n\n40\n00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.226\nUsually the term you'll hear there\nis what we call domain join or\n\n41\n00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:08.380\nwhen you join a computer to the domain,\n\n42\n00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.064\nit will then end up creating\nan object inside of Active Directory.\n\n43\n00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:16.054\nAnd that object by default is gonna end\nup getting stored in the computer's\n\n44\n00:02:16.054 --> 00:02:18.560\ncontainer inside of Active Directory.\n\n45\n00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.080\nSo let me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n46\n00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.310\nSo on my screen, I've got the Active\nDirectory Users and Computers brought\n\n47\n00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.490\nup here on my remote administration\nmachine inside of my domain.\n\n48\n00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.550\nNormally when you end up doing this,\n\n49\n00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.670\nwhere you create a computer inside of\nActive Directory by joining it first.\n\n50\n00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.460\nSo you take a computer that's not joined\nto the domain and you join it, you'll end\n\n51\n00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.370\nup creating an entry here in this generic\nComputers container that we have.\n\n52\n00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.125\nAnd when you do that that's\nperfectly fine and it works.\n\n53\n00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:54.020\nIt at least gets the computer\nto be joined to that domain,\n\n54\n00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.870\nestablishes some security that we\nwant to actually end up happening.\n\n55\n00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.310\nAnd so\nthat is an effective way to do this.\n\n56\n00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.250\nAnd if you're like me,\n\n57\n00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.590\nthis was kind of the very first way\nthat I was ever introduced to this.\n\n58\n00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.810\nBecause when I first got\nsigned on to do some jobs,\n\n59\n00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.570\nthere were 50 computers that\nneeded to be joined to the domain.\n\n60\n00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.550\nSo I was essentially sent around\nto different computers and said,\n\n61\n00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.520\njust join this computer at the domain.\n\n62\n00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.160\nI really didn't have access\nto the Active Directory.\n\n63\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.850\nI didn't really have a clue\nwhere they ended up.\n\n64\n00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.271\nBut when I established my very\nfirst Active Directory myself and\n\n65\n00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:28.866\nthen I started joining them.\n\n66\n00:03:28.866 --> 00:03:33.530\nI realized that every account ended up\njust by default getting created here.\n\n67\n00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.440\nSo once I get it here, the problem is\nfairly simple, even in Active Directory.\n\n68\n00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.350\nIt's still not really managed as much\nas it's just stored in one place.\n\n69\n00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.272\nSo there's no policies really set up here.\n\n70\n00:03:46.272 --> 00:03:49.600\nIf I'm actually gonna be moving those\ncomputers to be controlled by any type of\n\n71\n00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.460\npolicy inside of Active Directory,\nI'll need to, let's say for\n\n72\n00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.700\nexample, right-click on this computer and\nthen go to Move.\n\n73\n00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.000\nAnd from there I would move\nit into the proper OU for\n\n74\n00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.990\nthe management that I need to.\n\n75\n00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.620\nSo that's one of the ways that we can\n\n76\n00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.980\nend up getting the computer account\ninside of Active Directory.\n\n77\n00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.450\nNow the other one, of course,\n\n78\n00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.770\nis to actually do what we call\nprestaging the computer account instead.\n\n79\n00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.240\nSo when we prestage a computer account,\nthis is when the computer account is\n\n80\n00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:29.140\ncreated in Active Directory before we join\nit to the actual Active Directory itself.\n\n81\n00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.000\nSo what do I mean by that?\n\n82\n00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.416\nWell, let's go back here into\nthe machine for a moment.\n\n83\n00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:37.909\nSo even though I don't have a computer\nthat's joined to the domain,\n\n84\n00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.314\nI can go ahead and do that right here.\n\n85\n00:04:40.314 --> 00:04:45.098\nIs I can simply right-click on\nComputers if I want to, go to New, and\n\n86\n00:04:45.098 --> 00:04:48.490\nsimply create a new computer account okay?\n\n87\n00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.240\nSo all that can actually\nbe done fairly easily.\n\n88\n00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.780\nSo those are kind of the two\nmethods that we can do.\n\n89\n00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.360\nNow, as far as good skills and\ngood practices go, okay?\n\n90\n00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.970\nThe recommendation, though,\n\n91\n00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.040\nis to use the prestaged method when\ndoing this for Active Directory.\n\n92\n00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.300\nBecause there's actually, well,\n\n93\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.790\nsome benefits to it that we also\nhave to think about, as well.\n\n94\n00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.120\nSo that's what we wanna talk about next,\n\n95\n00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.620\nis this idea of some of these\ndifferent benefits here, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.644\nWhen it comes down to for\n\n97\n00:05:18.644 --> 00:05:24.224\ncomputers being joined to\nthe actual Active Directory, right?\n\n98\n00:05:24.224 --> 00:05:26.810\nNormally in an organization\nwhat might end up happening is,\n\n99\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.740\nlet's say that we're at the end of the\nlife cycle of the computers that we have.\n\n100\n00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.740\nOur company has just purchased,\nlet's say, 50 computers or\n\n101\n00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.850\n25 computers, whatever it might be.\n\n102\n00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.820\nAnd now,\nthey want this to actually be inside of or\n\n103\n00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.290\nmanaged by Active Directory\nat the same time.\n\n104\n00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.910\nWell, that means you have those computers.\n\n105\n00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.030\nThey might already come with Windows\ninstalled on them, they may not.\n\n106\n00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.664\nSo it might be that you chose to do\nsomething like when we used to purchase\n\n107\n00:05:53.664 --> 00:05:57.978\ncomputers from Dell, we would instead get\na version of free DOS on those computers.\n\n108\n00:05:57.978 --> 00:05:59.990\nWhich essentially is an operating system.\n\n109\n00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.860\nBut we really didn't have them installed.\n\n110\n00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.430\nWe just said they had to actually\nsell it with an operating system.\n\n111\n00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.730\nWe said put free DOS on it.\n\n112\n00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.360\nAnd the reason why is that we were\nusing Windows deployment services.\n\n113\n00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.310\nDeployment services, of course, allows me\nto put those computers on to my network.\n\n114\n00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.930\nI can then install, or deploy an image,\n\n115\n00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.110\nexcuse me,\nthat's actually on the network, itself.\n\n116\n00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.590\nAnd then I can get that computer to\njoin the domain at the same time\n\n117\n00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.895\nwhen all of that's actually done.\n\n118\n00:06:26.895 --> 00:06:30.810\nPrestaging these accounts in\nActive Directory really does help out with\n\n119\n00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.390\ndeployment services.\n\n120\n00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.960\nBecause then I can place\nthe computer in the OU\n\n121\n00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.480\nthat already has policies\nattached to them.\n\n122\n00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.055\nThe computer account is created\nwith a name that I want attached to\n\n123\n00:06:42.055 --> 00:06:42.966\nthat computer.\n\n124\n00:06:42.966 --> 00:06:45.950\nAnd it allows for\nthat computer when it first reboots and\n\n125\n00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.999\ncomes back up,\nall the policies already applied is gonna\n\n126\n00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:52.380\nbe managed in that particular OU\nthat I want it to be managed in.\n\n127\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.130\nAnd it's gonna be effectively ready\nto go instead of me having to go,\n\n128\n00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.180\nit's in the computer account,\nlet me move it to this OU, let me do that.\n\n129\n00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.750\nLet me do all that.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n130\n00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:02.381\n&gt;&gt; So that's actually a good one.\n\n131\n00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:06.123\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying by prestaging we\ncan really just, like the name implies,\n\n132\n00:07:06.123 --> 00:07:08.530\nset the stage,\nconfigure the system as needed.\n\n133\n00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.540\nEspecially if you're using a service\nlike you were in your situation with\n\n134\n00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.830\na deployment service.\n\n135\n00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.830\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthat's usually the key, right?\n\n136\n00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.210\nWith deployment services, it's something\nyou'd really want to go ahead and do.\n\n137\n00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:25.450\nBecause you wanna try and eliminate as\nmuch administrative effort as possible.\n\n138\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.147\nBecause if not, every one of these tasks,\n\n139\n00:07:27.147 --> 00:07:28.950\neven though they don't\nseem like a big deal.\n\n140\n00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.935\nWhen you multiply them by 50, by 100,\n\n141\n00:07:31.935 --> 00:07:36.868\nit becomes not only tedious but\nit becomes just time consuming instead.\n\n142\n00:07:36.868 --> 00:07:41.208\nSo by prestaging them where we've already\ngot the policy set, I'm not having to go\n\n143\n00:07:41.208 --> 00:07:45.210\nback and reboot the computer just\nto make sure the policy is created.\n\n144\n00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.898\nIt's gonna do that, even during that\ndeployment time, save us another step and\n\n145\n00:07:48.898 --> 00:07:50.046\nthat's actually a key.\n\n146\n00:07:50.046 --> 00:07:51.012\nSo let's get busy and\n\n147\n00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:54.615\nlet's take a look at this idea of actually\ncreating these different accounts.\n\n148\n00:07:54.615 --> 00:07:57.249\nWe're gonna show you using three\ndifferent methods to do this,\n\n149\n00:07:57.249 --> 00:07:58.285\nis what we're gonna do.\n\n150\n00:07:58.285 --> 00:07:59.289\nNow the great thing is,\n\n151\n00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:02.615\nit's a relatively quick Just like what\nI was describing a little bit earlier.\n\n152\n00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:06.531\nSo let's go to my machine here and we'll\nshow you, of course, probably the most\n\n153\n00:08:06.531 --> 00:08:10.860\ncommon tool to pre-stage, which is\nthe active directory users and computers.\n\n154\n00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:15.030\nSo, inside of here, remember I don't have\nan actual computer, but if I wanted to,\n\n155\n00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:20.260\nlet's say for the managers here,\nI wanted to add a computer into this OU.\n\n156\n00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.830\nWell, I can right-click inside of that OU.\n\n157\n00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.870\nSo I can either do it on Managers,\nand then go down to New,\n\n158\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.080\noops, and there's Computer.\n\n159\n00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.940\nAnd it's in here, in this Computer object.\n\n160\n00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.980\nLet me zoom out just a little bit,\nto not do that.\n\n161\n00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.730\nAnd then I can do the same\nnaming convention.\n\n162\n00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:40.260\nSo I can do O365, dash,\nI'm gonna make this one CLO,\n\n163\n00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.290\nlet me make it 99 here for right now.\n\n164\n00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.488\nJust because I know I'm doing something\na little bit later with some of\n\n165\n00:08:47.488 --> 00:08:48.130\nthe other numbers.\n\n166\n00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.439\nSo I'm just going to call it CL99.\n\n167\n00:08:50.439 --> 00:08:54.150\nActually, let's do a 91 here instead.\n\n168\n00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.340\nNow when I do something like this,\nit goes ahead and\n\n169\n00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.520\ngenerates a computer name for me.\n\n170\n00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.800\nAnd I can assign this computer as a pre\nWindows 2000 computer if I want to.\n\n171\n00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.772\nI'm gonna leave this alone for\nright now and click OK.\n\n172\n00:09:04.772 --> 00:09:08.560\nAnd there it is just as quickly.\n\n173\n00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.150\nI've now pre-staged a computer account.\n\n174\n00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.480\nSo now when deployment services hits it,\n\n175\n00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.780\nit's not gonna generate a new\none that I need to join to here.\n\n176\n00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.890\nAnd it's gonna create a new account\nup here on computers container.\n\n177\n00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:24.130\nIt's gonna search my Active Directory,\nand it's gonna see this name.\n\n178\n00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.880\nAnd essentially attach that computer\nthat are joined to the domain\n\n179\n00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.490\nto this one right here.\n\n180\n00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.191\nAs long as I've named that\ncomputer what I needed to,\n\n181\n00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:34.001\nit should find it right here, too.\n\n182\n00:09:34.001 --> 00:09:37.840\nAnd we'll show you how to do that when\nwe do the domain join part of this.\n\n183\n00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.440\nNow the other tool that we,\nas server administrators.\n\n184\n00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.950\nWanna become familiar with of course,\n\n185\n00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.160\nis the active directory\nadministration center.\n\n186\n00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.000\nSo inside of the active directory\nadministrative center here,\n\n187\n00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.210\nyou'll get something that looks fairly\nsimilar, over here on the left hand side I\n\n188\n00:09:55.210 --> 00:10:01.290\nselected my domain and also selection the\nOU, so normally when you first start off.\n\n189\n00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.420\nYou end up seeing where you can click,\nand there will be the OUs that you have.\n\n190\n00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.620\nThen I can select the one that I wanted.\n\n191\n00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.110\nAnd now I'm drilling down inside.\n\n192\n00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.710\nI already had managers.\n\n193\n00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:16.328\nSo there's one that I just created,\nan active director users and computers.\n\n194\n00:10:16.328 --> 00:10:20.890\nWhen I do that over here on the right-hand\nside, you'll see the task pane.\n\n195\n00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:25.700\nNotice that from here,\nI can select new and then\n\n196\n00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:31.370\nright here under new, notice that right\nhere it actually does say computer again.\n\n197\n00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:36.290\nAnd when I click on that, it actually\nhas a little bit more impressive looking\n\n198\n00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.100\nthan what we find inside of\nactive directory users and\n\n199\n00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:44.470\ncomputers, now notice on this one,\nit gives you a lot more options too.\n\n200\n00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:50.616\nSo if I said here, o365-CL,\n\n201\n00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:55.458\nfor client, module 92 here,\n\n202\n00:10:55.458 --> 00:11:02.580\nit starts filling out the names for\nme, then I can also do the same\n\n203\n00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:07.350\nthing where I can even now protect this\nfrom accidental deletion if I want to.\n\n204\n00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.739\nAnd even assign it to the pre\nWindows 2000 computer.\n\n205\n00:11:10.739 --> 00:11:15.012\nNotice it's actually saying\ncreate it in where I can change\n\n206\n00:11:15.012 --> 00:11:19.119\nthe OU container if I want to so\neven though I selected it.\n\n207\n00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:25.210\nI can even, begin to take a look at some\nof the other things I may want to do.\n\n208\n00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:28.860\nThe manage by, and select to who\nI'm actually gonna be managed by.\n\n209\n00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.750\nOkay?\nIs it a member of another\n\n210\n00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.120\ngroup that we have?\n\n211\n00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.470\nIs there any authentication policy?\n\n212\n00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.440\nYou name it I can actually\ndo a lot more here\n\n213\n00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.870\nin the active directory\nadministrative center than we can do.\n\n214\n00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.700\nSo, all that, of course,\nis actually easily navigable\n\n215\n00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.300\nby the left-hand navigation pane\nthat we also see, over here.\n\n216\n00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.750\nSo, I'm gonna ask you to just fill out,\nkinda,\n\n217\n00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:54.380\nthe same thing that I did in the other\none, click OK, and, now, there it is.\n\n218\n00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.170\nI now have these two computers listed for\nthis OU.\n\n219\n00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.240\nSo, there it is, and\n\n220\n00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:04.120\ninside of Active Directory user computers,\nyou can see, doing this and\n\n221\n00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.880\nthe side of the administrative center,\nall this works great, Cherokee.\n\n222\n00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.260\nUntil we start working\nwith multiple computers.\n\n223\n00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:16.115\nThis is where it becomes a little bit\nmore challenging to be able to do this.\n\n224\n00:12:16.115 --> 00:12:20.770\nSo,that means,\nwe can also head over into power shell and\n\n225\n00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.050\nsee kind of the same things.\n\n226\n00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:26.440\nSo, that's what were actually going\nto also take a look at, as well.\n\n227\n00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.860\nIf we can do it inside of\nactive directory use computers,\n\n228\n00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.670\ninside of the administrative center, we\ndefinitely can do the same thing inside of\n\n229\n00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.820\npower shell, and that's what we\nalso want to take advantage of too.\n\n230\n00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:42.680\nNow, can I create a single computer\ninside of active directory using this.\n\n231\n00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.650\nI definitely can.\n\n232\n00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:50.029\nSo, if I do a new-ADComputer and\n\n233\n00:12:50.029 --> 00:12:53.492\nthen I give it a name.\n\n234\n00:12:53.492 --> 00:12:58.503\nAnd let's just do 0365-CL and\n\n235\n00:12:58.503 --> 00:13:01.514\nwe'll do 93 here.\n\n236\n00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:03.560\nAnd we'll just leave it at this.\n\n237\n00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.280\nNow, Cherokee, I'm not actually adding\nany other information in here, so\n\n238\n00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.990\nwhen I do something like this,\nand I've got it, and\n\n239\n00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.680\nI press, let me see if I can,\nthere it goes.\n\n240\n00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.630\nI press enter,\nit kind of says hey look, here it is.\n\n241\n00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:19.740\nEverything is done,\n\n242\n00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:24.610\nlet's check it out inside of the Active\nDirectory Users and Computers this time.\n\n243\n00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.510\n&gt;&gt; Seems like we're missing a few\nbits of information there, Ronnie.\n\n244\n00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.380\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n\n245\n00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.780\nAnd that's what we wanted to\nkind of point out as well.\n\n246\n00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:36.370\nIf I don't add in a bit of information,\nI'll notice that even though I refreshed\n\n247\n00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.170\nit, and I still followed that same\nnaming convention that I did, right?\n\n248\n00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.340\nA little bit earlier.\n\n249\n00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.730\nBut notice it's not right here\ninside of my manager's OU.\n\n250\n00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.040\nAnd that's because I\ndidn't set all that up.\n\n251\n00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.990\nInside of that PowerShell, I would also\nneed to include what distinguished name\n\n252\n00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.180\nof the OU where this was to be placed.\n\n253\n00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.050\n&gt;&gt; Okay so by default,\nwhere they placed it.\n\n254\n00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.860\n&gt;&gt; Yup, well the same place, right?\n\n255\n00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.870\nIf we were actually creating it, I would\ngo to computers here, and let's see,\n\n256\n00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.310\nI should be able to go to actions and\nrefresh.\n\n257\n00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.812\nAnd now notice, there it is.\n\n258\n00:14:07.812 --> 00:14:09.860\nOffice 365 or O 365.\n\n259\n00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.400\nActually, that looks like a zero.\n\n260\n00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:11.980\n&gt;&gt; Zero.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n261\n00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.870\nI actually did type it in wrong here.\n\n262\n00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.740\nSo that's where it would\nactually be is right here.\n\n263\n00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.940\nSo it does place it there.\n\n264\n00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:23.040\nSo in this one,\nit does take a bit more typing, okay?\n\n265\n00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.610\nBut I did wanna show you\nwe can do this for one.\n\n266\n00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.510\nBut its real effectiveness,\nright, in the Powershell, and\n\n267\n00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:33.390\nin joining computers' domain,\nis when you have a lot of computers.\n\n268\n00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.180\nSo, the example that I gave earlier,\nCherokee,\n\n269\n00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.960\nis actually really valuable here.\n\n270\n00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.430\nThe very fact is, we got,\nwe had at one time,\n\n271\n00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.980\nI'm trying to remember, it was like 50\ncomputers that came in at one time.\n\n272\n00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.380\nAnd they all had to be\njoined to the domain, but\n\n273\n00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.070\nalso had to be in Active Directory,\nand I could\n\n274\n00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.910\nput them all in the computers domain and\nmanage them separately if wanted to, but\n\n275\n00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:55.230\nwhat if I need to do it all at one time,\nand its efficiency to do it?\n\n276\n00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.720\nWell, PowerShell is the way to go.\n\n277\n00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.020\nNow, when I was doing it, PowerShell\nwasn't really the most easy way to do\n\n278\n00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.680\nanything, but you still could do it,\nit still takes a little bit of time.\n\n279\n00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.390\nBut the great thing is,\nit'll be much more efficient.\n\n280\n00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:12.880\nThe way that this ends up working then\nIs that you want to create a CSV file or\n\n281\n00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.110\na text file.\n\n282\n00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.670\nSo let's, let me make sure I'm telling\nyou about [INAUDIBLE] CSV file.\n\n283\n00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:23.180\nSo inside of my, let me see where I am,\nmy lab files here,\n\n284\n00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.960\nI created one called computers.\n\n285\n00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.660\nLet me take a look at this file.\n\n286\n00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:31.840\nIt's just a simple note\npad file that I created.\n\n287\n00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:36.610\nAnd here are the list of computer\nnames that I wanted to be able to use.\n\n288\n00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.400\nSo, I went ahead and just created all\nof these different computer names.\n\n289\n00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.810\nI included in some regular desktop\ncomputers as well as some servers\n\n290\n00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:44.820\nthat you can see.\n\n291\n00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.090\nI save that, I saved it under a name.\n\n292\n00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:52.489\nI need to remember the path that this is\ngoing to be in, I need to find that out.\n\n293\n00:15:52.489 --> 00:15:57.438\nI simply click here tells me lab files,\nand then that computer name, I'm good and\n\n294\n00:15:57.438 --> 00:15:58.526\nI'm ready to go.\n\n295\n00:15:58.526 --> 00:16:03.198\nWell with that along with\nsome PowerShell scripting.\n\n296\n00:16:03.198 --> 00:16:05.865\nWe can really help ourselves out here.\n\n297\n00:16:05.865 --> 00:16:08.133\nSo the first thing that\nI'm going to do is,\n\n298\n00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:10.800\nI'm gonna create a couple of variables.\n\n299\n00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:16.410\nSo here is my computer list, and I'm\ncreating the variable for this list here.\n\n300\n00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:23.210\nAnd this is gonna be C Lab Files and\nthen Computers.\n\n301\n00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.600\nAll right, so that's the first variable.\n\n302\n00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.380\nThe second variable is gonna be for\nmy distinguished name.\n\n303\n00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.060\nSo on this one, this is gonna be OU.\n\n304\n00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:41.400\nThis time I'm just gonna place it in the\nOffice 365 OU, just to help me out here,\n\n305\n00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.810\ncuz I can remember that one\ninstead of me creating one.\n\n306\n00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:47.310\nYou can create one as well at\nthe same time, if you choose to.\n\n307\n00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:53.329\nBut here we're going to do OU365 then DC=,\n\n308\n00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:56.337\nand the first one here,\n\n309\n00:16:56.337 --> 00:17:02.358\nofficeprodemoco,DC=onmicrosoft, oops,\n\n310\n00:17:02.358 --> 00:17:08.237\nI always do the .com and\nI'm not supposed to.\n\n311\n00:17:08.237 --> 00:17:13.790\nThen it's ,DC=com.\n\n312\n00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.650\nSo there is my second variable.\n\n313\n00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.950\nNow that means I don't have to type that\nout again, which is always a plus for\n\n314\n00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.700\nme since I'm terrible at typing.\n\n315\n00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:26.390\nEspecially when somebody's watching me, so\nit's actually never a good thing, right?\n\n316\n00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:31.240\nSo here, I'm gonna import this CSV file\n\n317\n00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:36.970\nhere by saying hey, I wanna import a CSV\nfile, where's that file gonna be located?\n\n318\n00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.780\nWell, guess what I actually\nhave stored inside of list.\n\n319\n00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.950\nSo, that's actually make sense for\nwhat we want.\n\n320\n00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:50.380\nNow, I'm gonna pipe that\ninto A Foreach-object.\n\n321\n00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.010\nSo now you see I'm using\nthe auto complete dash,\n\n322\n00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:59.210\neven put it in the proper case\nthat the syntax recognizes.\n\n323\n00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.178\nAnd now we need some fancy brackets here.\n\n324\n00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:12.240\nSo New-ADComputer -NAME.\n\n325\n00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:18.659\nAnd then I need another\nkind of unusual one,\n\n326\n00:18:18.659 --> 00:18:23.180\nwhich is gonna be $_.NAME.\n\n327\n00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.630\nAnd then where is that gonna be?\n\n328\n00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.653\nThis is gonna be underneath that OU.\n\n329\n00:18:28.653 --> 00:18:31.720\nLet me go on and close this out here.\n\n330\n00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.420\nI want to come back to something here,\nCherokee.\n\n331\n00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:39.250\nAnything look strange in this\nscript that I have here?\n\n332\n00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.500\n&gt;&gt; Well, I see the color coding and\n\n333\n00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.740\nI don't know if everyone is familiar\nwith that concept yet, Ronnie.\n\n334\n00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.290\nSo is that what we're looking at?\n\n335\n00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:49.520\n&gt;&gt; Well, the color coding but\nlook at this unusual thing right here\n\n336\n00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.530\nwhereas the dollar sign and\nunderscore, okay?\n\n337\n00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:56.170\nSo that's something that we'll\nprobably going to run into\n\n338\n00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:01.160\nquite often as we deal more in PowerShell,\nespecially with something like this\n\n339\n00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:05.890\nwhere I'm doing something like import\nwhat's actually inside of this file.\n\n340\n00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.550\nSo go ahead and import that file\ninto Active Directory, right?\n\n341\n00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:10.960\nAnd then for each object.\n\n342\n00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:16.010\nSo in everything that you find in that, we\nare gonna create a new computer account,\n\n343\n00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:17.570\nput that under NAME.\n\n344\n00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.510\nBut what does this actually\nmean is what we want here.\n\n345\n00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.096\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n346\n00:19:21.096 --> 00:19:27.290\n&gt;&gt; So what this $_ really kind of\ndoes in a very simplified way,\n\n347\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:32.300\nis we're actually referring\nit back to list over here.\n\n348\n00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.360\nNow, if you'll notice, so Cherokee did\npoint out like the color coding here.\n\n349\n00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.152\nNotice that it's actually saying,\nhey I'm looking for\n\n350\n00:19:40.152 --> 00:19:43.080\nthe proceeding variable, which I can't.\n\n351\n00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.540\n[INAUDIBLE] I don't know\nwhy I can't say that\n\n352\n00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.140\n&gt;&gt; I thought you were looking for\n\n353\n00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.790\nlike sea foam green-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sea foam green that's\n\n354\n00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.620\nexactly what I am looking for\nsure is that what color that is?\n\n355\n00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.930\nSea foam green, wow so there we go,\nso we're actually doing that and\n\n356\n00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:59.430\nwe're attaching where we\nwant it to place this, okay?\n\n357\n00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:03.920\nSo notice that there's also this\nlittle attachment here on the NAME.\n\n358\n00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.430\nSo it's saying, take that,\nand then place it under NAME.\n\n359\n00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.120\nWell, that makes sense.\n\n360\n00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.370\nAnd then store it here, inside of that OU.\n\n361\n00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.420\nSo that's what you're actually\nseeing a lot of times.\n\n362\n00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.850\nJust take whatever is preceding\nthat you place here, so\n\n363\n00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:21.970\ntake this information for every object\nthat's in it make sure you also put it\n\n364\n00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.610\nexactly where I want you to put\nit is what we are seeing here.\n\n365\n00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:29.368\nIf I have typed out everything correctly,\nthere is one of two options here.\n\n366\n00:20:29.368 --> 00:20:33.480\nI either didn't type it out correctly and\nit is going to spew red everywhere, or\n\n367\n00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.830\nI did type it in correctly and it may\nstill spew red everywhere for all I know.\n\n368\n00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.160\nLet's go ahead and press enter here, and\n&gt;&gt; No red.\n\n369\n00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.230\n&gt;&gt; And no red, which is an amazing thing,\nbecause what we normally see,\n\n370\n00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.600\nespecially when I'm doing the typing here.\n\n371\n00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.410\nSo this meant did it actually do that?\n\n372\n00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:51.880\nSo in the blink of an eye, Cherokee, do\nyou think I actually added in those 16 or\n\n373\n00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.604\n17 computers that I had in there\ninside of Active Directory?\n\n374\n00:20:54.604 --> 00:20:56.259\n&gt;&gt; I trust PowerShell.\n\n375\n00:20:56.259 --> 00:20:56.834\n&gt;&gt; You trust PowerShell?\n\n376\n00:20:56.834 --> 00:20:57.359\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n377\n00:20:57.359 --> 00:20:58.131\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n378\n00:20:58.131 --> 00:21:01.070\nSo let's see if we can go into-\n&gt;&gt; It can be a little iffy sometimes.\n\n379\n00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.610\nSometimes you do have to go back in.\n\n380\n00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.170\nI always recommend going back and\ndouble checking.\n\n381\n00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.700\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; But, let's do that.\n\n382\n00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so let's go ahead and\ndouble check this thing here.\n\n383\n00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:14.100\nSo now, when I do this,\nit's not in the computer.\n\n384\n00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.660\nWell, let me refresh this, okay?\n\n385\n00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.830\nWell Cherokee,\nit doesn't look like it showed up.\n\n386\n00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.890\n&gt;&gt; Well you said that Office 365 OU.\n\n387\n00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:21.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go.\n\n388\n00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:22.940\nYou're brighter than I am.\n\n389\n00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.080\nI didn't remember that,\neven though I actually typed it.\n\n390\n00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:25.960\nI did.\nI'm lying to you.\n\n391\n00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.240\nSo let's go to O, Cherokee.\n\n392\n00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.590\n&gt;&gt; You were trying to trick me.\n\n393\n00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:30.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee, look,\n\n394\n00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.154\nOffice 365 still didn't appear in there.\n\n395\n00:21:33.154 --> 00:21:35.170\nAnd I've got no errors, okay?\n\n396\n00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:35.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n397\n00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:40.150\n&gt;&gt; Now, if I go to the action and\nrefresh, hey, look at that!\n\n398\n00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:45.040\nThey all ended up appearing in the OU\nwhere I wanted to place them immediately.\n\n399\n00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:49.400\nThis is where now we can plug those\ncomputers in wherever we want to and\n\n400\n00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.640\nwhen we now tell it using our deployment\nservices to do a domain join, well,\n\n401\n00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.850\nwhat is going to happen?\n\n402\n00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:58.600\nIt's gonna go ahead and join that\ncomputer directly to that domain and\n\n403\n00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.330\nthen you're off and\nyou're ready to go, okay?\n\n404\n00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:05.740\nSo fairly easy to be able to\nunderstand and be able to do that.\n\n405\n00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.440\nSo this is where you do\nget to that point where\n\n406\n00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.970\nthis is something else that\nwe can see as we start, okay?\n\n407\n00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.560\nSo the great thing is, remember that that\nmeans that any policies that are actually\n\n408\n00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.490\napplied to this OU, it's actually\ngoing to be applied to all these\n\n409\n00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:22.150\ncomputers immediately, instead of me\nhaving to move those computers around and\n\n410\n00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:26.210\ndoing a second stage check of anything\nelse that we need to as well.\n\n411\n00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:29.000\n&gt;&gt; So, it'd be a great way to go ahead and\nautomatically push out any kind of\n\n412\n00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.840\npolicies and make sure that those\nnew computers that have been added\n\n413\n00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:37.340\nare compliant with whatever policies your\norganization may go ahead and push out.\n\n414\n00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:41.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is something that we\nneed to make sure that we understand and\n\n415\n00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.310\nthat we do see this happening, right?\n\n416\n00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.490\nSo take a look at PowerShell,\nmake sure you learn it and\n\n417\n00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.140\nmake sure you pay attention there.\n\n418\n00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.510\nNow we wanna do a couple of things here,\nright away.\n\n419\n00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:56.634\nBut the problem is I think it's gonna\ntake longer than the time we have left,\n\n420\n00:22:56.634 --> 00:22:57.285\nCherokee.\n\n421\n00:22:57.285 --> 00:22:58.927\nSo it may be better if I go ahead and\n\n422\n00:22:58.927 --> 00:23:02.150\nstop now since we only have a few\nminutes left in this episode.\n\n423\n00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:03.320\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan, Ronnie.\n\n424\n00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.150\nBut we do have more information\nheaded your way so stay tuned.\n\n425\n00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.130\nBut for this show we'll go ahead and\nsign out.\n\n426\n00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.000\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n427\n00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.880\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n428\n00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.977\n&gt;&gt; See you next time her on ITPro.TV.\n\n429\n00:23:13.977 --> 00:23:19.828\n[MUSIC]\n\n430\n00:23:19.828 --> 00:23:25.869\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.007\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:11.916\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.916 --> 00:00:14.630\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your Server 101 series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.590\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.760\nSo this is actually a part two\ncontinuation where we were looking at how\n\n8\n00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.880\nto create and\nmanage active directory computer accounts.\n\n9\n00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.620\nAnd back in studios with us\ntoday we have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.580\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n11\n00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.410\n&gt;&gt; It's going well as we take a look at\nmore on this idea of active directory and\n\n12\n00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.075\nmanaging computer accounts.\n\n13\n00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:37.020\nRemember that in previous episodes we\ndid show the creation of, of course,\n\n14\n00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.100\nthese accounts.\n\n15\n00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.744\nUsing not only the active directory uses\na computers as well as the administrative\n\n16\n00:00:42.744 --> 00:00:46.594\ncenter, we also showed you the benefit\nof using PowerShell right?\n\n17\n00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:50.050\nThe ability to create multiple\ncomputer accounts at one time.\n\n18\n00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.950\nDoing that through PowerShell\nreally helps us to save time.\n\n19\n00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.678\nNow it doesn't seem like it when\nwe're first beginning right?\n\n20\n00:00:55.678 --> 00:00:59.946\nBut the overall effect when you start\ndoing this for 50 computers at a time,\n\n21\n00:00:59.946 --> 00:01:04.476\n100 computers at a time, it really is\ngonna you some time especially if you take\n\n22\n00:01:04.476 --> 00:01:07.250\nthe time to write up the script\nthe way you want to.\n\n23\n00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.134\nMake sure you check out Brian's book on\nthat Windows Server 101 that this show is\n\n24\n00:01:12.134 --> 00:01:13.540\nactually based off of.\n\n25\n00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.284\nAnd it'll show you those scripts that will\nkinda help guide you along to be able\n\n26\n00:01:17.284 --> 00:01:17.858\nto do that.\n\n27\n00:01:17.858 --> 00:01:19.813\nNow the other thing that we need to do is,\n\n28\n00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:22.352\nas we move into the managing\nside of things, right.\n\n29\n00:01:22.352 --> 00:01:25.744\nIs now that we have those\ncomputer counts pre-stage,\n\n30\n00:01:25.744 --> 00:01:29.130\nhow do we attach them to\nthe actual computers?\n\n31\n00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.496\nSo that actually makes sense, right?\n\n32\n00:01:30.496 --> 00:01:35.391\nTo be able to do something like that\nis actually quite, I don't wanna say Is\n\n33\n00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:40.480\nnot the easiest thing on the world,\nthe very first time you do it, okay.\n\n34\n00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.970\nBut it's not the most difficult\nthing in the world as well.\n\n35\n00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.910\nSo we're gonna show you\nhow I actually first did.\n\n36\n00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.700\nAnd I wanna show you that you can\nalso do the same PowerShell and\n\n37\n00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.730\nmake this also work and\nattach that computer to the domain too.\n\n38\n00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.443\nSo we're gonna kind of walk you\nthrough the aspect of doing it the way\n\n39\n00:01:58.443 --> 00:02:00.023\nthat I usually did it.\n\n40\n00:02:00.023 --> 00:02:02.807\nAnd then, we're gonna actually\ndo it with the power shell,\n\n41\n00:02:02.807 --> 00:02:05.716\ncuz I really only have one computer\nto kind of be able to do this.\n\n42\n00:02:05.716 --> 00:02:09.070\nSo let's take a look here,\nas what we want to be able to do.\n\n43\n00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.617\nNow, let's start off with this diagram,\nand make sure we understand what is\n\n44\n00:02:12.617 --> 00:02:18.675\nhappening when we start talking about\njoining the computer, To the domain, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:18.675 --> 00:02:21.281\nSo here's ITProTV as a domain.\n\n46\n00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:24.435\nThe one I'm gonna be using is\nthe Office Pro demo co okay?\n\n47\n00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:29.153\nSo when we first have it, right,\nwhat's actually gonna end up happening\n\n48\n00:02:29.153 --> 00:02:34.098\nis that whatever computer that we put\nonline is then going to be by itself, and\n\n49\n00:02:34.098 --> 00:02:37.620\nit's outside of this management\ndomain that we have.\n\n50\n00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.462\nWhen we talk about the idea of joining the\ncomputer to the domain, it can go ahead\n\n51\n00:02:43.462 --> 00:02:47.817\nand also create that computer account,\nwhen it is joined to the domain.\n\n52\n00:02:47.817 --> 00:02:52.334\nAnd when we do so, it establishes\nwhat we call this trust relationship.\n\n53\n00:02:52.334 --> 00:02:57.415\nA secure authenticated connection between\nwhatever machine that we're on and\n\n54\n00:02:57.415 --> 00:03:01.950\nthe domain controller that we\nare connecting to, as well.\n\n55\n00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.410\nNow, the other way to do this is\nwhat we just did, where we created\n\n56\n00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.540\nall those different computer\naccounts first in active directly.\n\n57\n00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.300\nAnd then, we go through that\nprocess of joining domain.\n\n58\n00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.331\nIt will essentially attach the name\nthat we assign to this computer to\n\n59\n00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.880\nthe pre-stage account\nthat we actually did.\n\n60\n00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.578\nAnd so now we'll end up with that\nsecured connection right back\n\n61\n00:03:25.578 --> 00:03:29.786\nto the domain controller for each one\nof these machines when we do that.\n\n62\n00:03:29.786 --> 00:03:33.610\nNow, you might be wondering,\nall right, so that's actually good.\n\n63\n00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.200\nIt is good,\nbecause it actually does now mean that\n\n64\n00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.240\nall those computers that we have in,\nthose 16 or 17 computers that we added in,\n\n65\n00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.820\nthey also have those trust\nrelationships with the domain itself.\n\n66\n00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.020\nSo let me go ahead and\nswitch on over here.\n\n67\n00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.324\nSo every computer that we join in ends up\nestablishing that trust relationship with\n\n68\n00:03:53.324 --> 00:03:54.006\nthe domain.\n\n69\n00:03:54.006 --> 00:03:58.010\nBut remember that Active Directory\nitself though, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.190\nOnce we have that trust relationship\nwith our domain controller we're\n\n71\n00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.210\npart of that Active Directory domain.\n\n72\n00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.560\nThe Active Directory domain\nitself is designed so\n\n73\n00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.730\nthat we can also establish a secure\nauthentication between domain members\n\n74\n00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.530\nsuch as CL02, 3, 4, 5,\nall the ones that we joined.\n\n75\n00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.090\nAnd even between them and\n\n76\n00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.490\nresources that might be available\non the actual network itself.\n\n77\n00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.552\nSo they essentially established a nice,\nsecure authentication between these and\n\n78\n00:04:28.552 --> 00:04:31.527\nall the other members\ninside of that domain too.\n\n79\n00:04:31.527 --> 00:04:35.377\nAnd that's actually very important\nbecause now that means they're under one\n\n80\n00:04:35.377 --> 00:04:36.725\nadministrative control.\n\n81\n00:04:36.725 --> 00:04:40.933\nNow, how do they keep that relationship\nestablished is through what we call\n\n82\n00:04:40.933 --> 00:04:42.740\nsecured channel okay?\n\n83\n00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.760\nSecured channel is actually validated or\n\n84\n00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.540\nworks because we have a service running\non our machines called net logon service.\n\n85\n00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.233\nEvery time your computer reboots it\nbegins to talk to active directory,\n\n86\n00:04:55.233 --> 00:04:59.229\nto see if this relationship is actually\nstill established and still working,\n\n87\n00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.515\nstill doing everything that it\nneeds to and everything is good.\n\n88\n00:05:02.515 --> 00:05:06.893\nAnd this is done by using kind of\na rotating password that's generated\n\n89\n00:05:06.893 --> 00:05:10.320\nbetween the domain controller and\nthe machines.\n\n90\n00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.630\nAnd that way they'll always\nestablish that connection and\n\n91\n00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.490\nthat will be done and\nthat's the way it goes.\n\n92\n00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.190\nSo that's the whole goal\nbehind doing this domain join,\n\n93\n00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.870\nprestaging all of these computer accounts,\ndoing all that.\n\n94\n00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.682\nSo of course that means that's what we're\ngonna show you and we're also gonna show\n\n95\n00:05:25.682 --> 00:05:29.383\nyou how to check whether or not the trust\nrelationship is actually still there and\n\n96\n00:05:29.383 --> 00:05:31.958\nsecure channel is actually up and\nworking as well okay?\n\n97\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:35.440\nSo let's go ahead and just start\nby joining a computer to a domain.\n\n98\n00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.260\nAt least we'll start that process here.\n\n99\n00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.508\nNow what does a domain joined\ncomputer first, or actually,\n\n100\n00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:43.270\nhow do we validate that?\n\n101\n00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.606\nLet me get all the way\nback to the desktop.\n\n102\n00:05:44.606 --> 00:05:47.640\nThere it goes, 19,000 ways to do this.\n\n103\n00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.780\nNow there's a couple ways\nthat you can see this.\n\n104\n00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.690\nOne of the ways that I do it,\n\n105\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.040\nis if I right-click on the Start button,\nI go to System.\n\n106\n00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.390\nAnd it's right here that we\nare taking a look, there it is, okay.\n\n107\n00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.060\nI just wanna make sure.\n\n108\n00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.610\nNotice here on this Windows 10 machine,\n\n109\n00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.830\nthere is the PC name and what you're\nlooking for is organization, okay.\n\n110\n00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.858\nSo usually that gives you a hit that hey,\n\n111\n00:06:12.858 --> 00:06:15.192\nthis is where everything\nis actually joined.\n\n112\n00:06:15.192 --> 00:06:16.943\nAnd that we are ready to go.\n\n113\n00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:21.912\nSo that normally is the end result of what\nwe're normally seeing when we do this.\n\n114\n00:06:21.912 --> 00:06:27.330\nNow the other part of this, let me see if\nI can get to where I want to get to here\n\n115\n00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:34.002\nwhich is the, where is my,\nI always go through here as well.\n\n116\n00:06:34.002 --> 00:06:37.591\nSo here I'm going to the File&gt; Explore,\nand\n\n117\n00:06:37.591 --> 00:06:41.373\nI right-click on this PC and\ngo to Properties.\n\n118\n00:06:41.373 --> 00:06:45.431\nHere, this is the way that I like\nseeing it a little bit better okay?\n\n119\n00:06:45.431 --> 00:06:49.057\nSo inside of control panel and\nsystem security and system,\n\n120\n00:06:49.057 --> 00:06:51.970\nthis is where we can join\na computer to a domain.\n\n121\n00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.532\nAnd this is the way that\nI learned how to do this.\n\n122\n00:06:53.532 --> 00:06:56.978\n&gt;&gt; And they actually use the term domain,\nso there's no confusion about organization\n\n123\n00:06:56.978 --> 00:06:57.613\nor-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n124\n00:06:57.613 --> 00:06:58.261\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n125\n00:06:58.261 --> 00:07:02.248\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so here, you do see,\nhere it is computer name domain and\n\n126\n00:07:02.248 --> 00:07:07.295\nworkgroup settings, there's the computer\nname and here's the full computer\n\n127\n00:07:07.295 --> 00:07:12.516\nname that we have, which of course is the\nhost and the domain itself all together.\n\n128\n00:07:12.516 --> 00:07:18.375\nIf I select Change Settings, now that's\ngonna ask me for credentials to do this.\n\n129\n00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:23.099\nRemember that every single user inside of\nActive Directory normally they get ten\n\n130\n00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:26.610\nopportunities to join a computer\ndomain regardless of.\n\n131\n00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.221\nAs long as they're actually\na member of the domain to do this.\n\n132\n00:07:29.221 --> 00:07:34.770\nSo here I'm gonna use\nofficeprodemoco/Lance here and\n\n133\n00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.620\nthen hopefully I can\ntype in Lance's password.\n\n134\n00:07:45.656 --> 00:07:48.088\nClick Yes yeah, so that's actually,\n\n135\n00:07:48.088 --> 00:07:52.170\nit's telling me I need to elevate\nprivileges and that's fine.\n\n136\n00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.774\nBut that's where you would\nnormally go to be able to do this.\n\n137\n00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:59.724\nBut for me, this machine is kinda\nbalking at me to do this again.\n\n138\n00:07:59.724 --> 00:08:02.816\nLet me try once again here.\n\n139\n00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:06.010\nIt might actually want me to do\nsomething a little bit different here.\n\n140\n00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.893\nI don't know why, but this machine\nhas been a little bit picky at times.\n\n141\n00:08:13.054 --> 00:08:14.918\nLet me see if it actually\nwill let me do it this way.\n\n142\n00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:20.300\nThere it goes, okay.\n\n143\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.890\nThat's what I was trying to get to.\n\n144\n00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.700\nSo I just logged in as a local\nadministrator instead, and\n\n145\n00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.380\nthat makes sense.\n\n146\n00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.050\nThe reason why is because I'm trying to\n\n147\n00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.070\nsimulate that I'm not a member\nof the domain to join this.\n\n148\n00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.140\nSo it's when you get here\ninto System Properties,\n\n149\n00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.520\nthis is where you would select Change.\n\n150\n00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.610\nAnd it's right here that you'd probably\nfind where it says Workgroup and\n\n151\n00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.290\nit spells out Workgroup\nin all capital letters.\n\n152\n00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.710\nYou'd click on this.\n\n153\n00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.630\nType in the domain that you want to join.\n\n154\n00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.740\nYou also want to change the computer name.\n\n155\n00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.880\nNow normally,\nif your computer name is self generated,\n\n156\n00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.960\nwhich it normally is a lot of times.\n\n157\n00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.489\nThen changing this is going to\nbe the first thing that you do.\n\n158\n00:08:59.489 --> 00:09:03.427\nAnd it might require you to reboot the\ncomputer, and then you can go through and\n\n159\n00:09:03.427 --> 00:09:05.170\ndo this process again.\n\n160\n00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.300\nSo, joining it,\n\n161\n00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.710\nmake sure you, or excuse me, change the\nname of the computer, that's first, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.070\nMake sure it's the name\nthat you want it to be.\n\n163\n00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.649\nAnd then at that point, come back in,\nchange the domain, and then you clock OK\n\n164\n00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:19.957\nand when you click OK, it's gonna ask\nyou to fill in those credentials,\n\n165\n00:09:19.957 --> 00:09:23.839\nthose network credentials that will allow\nyour computer to be joined to the domain.\n\n166\n00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:28.945\nIt will then ask you to restart the\ncomputer and you'll be able to do that.\n\n167\n00:09:28.945 --> 00:09:31.920\nAll right, so that's not exactly\nthe hardest thing in the world.\n\n168\n00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.150\n&gt;&gt; I do wanna point something out.\n\n169\n00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:38.750\nIf you are hopping back and forth or\nmaking a significant change like that,\n\n170\n00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.620\njust note, if you're coming off of a\ndomain you always wanna make sure you have\n\n171\n00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:47.870\nthose credentials for the local admin\nif you're moving towards a work group.\n\n172\n00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.470\nOtherwise you'll be finding yourself using\nsome kind of password reset utility.\n\n173\n00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.711\nAnd I'm not speaking from experience,\ndon't fall.\n\n174\n00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:57.082\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nyou can end up doing that.\n\n175\n00:09:57.082 --> 00:09:59.490\nIt normally tells you if you're\nactually gonna unjoin that computer\n\n176\n00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:00.350\nfrom the domain.\n\n177\n00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.500\nMake sure you know what the actual\nadministrative password is to get back in.\n\n178\n00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.770\nBut believe it or not,\nunjoining the computer is not difficult.\n\n179\n00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.400\nIt's just saying make sure you\nremember those credentials so\n\n180\n00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.170\nthat you can get logged in there back\nwhen everything kind of reboots.\n\n181\n00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.300\nNow that's actually gonna be key, right?\n\n182\n00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.130\nThe great thing is,\neven though you can do this.\n\n183\n00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.850\nAnd this is the way that I've done,\nI can't tell you,\n\n184\n00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.349\nI'm gonna say hundreds of computers.\n\n185\n00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.710\nI don't think a thousand yet but\nI'm gonna say hundreds, probably 600 or\n\n186\n00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.800\n700 computers doing this.\n\n187\n00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.915\nYou become very quick at it but\nits still a process, right?\n\n188\n00:10:30.915 --> 00:10:34.080\nSo it still is kind of\nrepetitive process and\n\n189\n00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.450\nyou get ways in which you do this\nefficiently and more efficiently.\n\n190\n00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.000\nWhen I actually worked in\na classroom instruction and\n\n191\n00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.970\nwe had these 16 computers, I could two\nat one time Is what I could actually do.\n\n192\n00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:46.940\n&gt;&gt; Fancy.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I could.\n\n193\n00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.420\nI could actually reach\nover to two keyboards and\n\n194\n00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:54.240\nactually do the exact same keystrokes and\nthe only thing I, because our domain\n\n195\n00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.990\nname was very short because we\nalso used kind of a child domain.\n\n196\n00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:01.050\nRight?\nOurs was just GNV at the very beginning,\n\n197\n00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.720\nso it was very easy to be able to do that.\n\n198\n00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.670\nSo it was simple.\n\n199\n00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.070\nIt was that,\nthree keys that I would have to push and\n\n200\n00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.680\nthen I would restart the computer and they\nwould simply reboot and rejoin the domain.\n\n201\n00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.316\nSo it was actually very\neasy to be able to do.\n\n202\n00:11:15.316 --> 00:11:18.907\nAt the same time, it's not something you\nwant to do especially if you have hundreds\n\n203\n00:11:18.907 --> 00:11:19.910\nof computers.\n\n204\n00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.960\nIt's still a boring task,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n205\n00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.844\nIt's one of those.\n\n206\n00:11:22.844 --> 00:11:26.180\nNow, so now that you understand that and\nyou'll probably be seeing that.\n\n207\n00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.420\nIf your already at that network plus level\nand you're hired in as a technician.\n\n208\n00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.340\nMore than likely you've done that probably\nmore times than I can explain,okay?\n\n209\n00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.600\nNow, the other way of course is well,\ndoing it through PowerShell.\n\n210\n00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.040\nSo, this time,\nlet's see if I can get logged in here.\n\n211\n00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.690\nSo I am just, I think.\n\n212\n00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:45.630\nYeah, there we go.\n\n213\n00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.280\nSo I've logged in with this machine.\n\n214\n00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.514\nThis one is not joined\nto the domain at all.\n\n215\n00:11:52.932 --> 00:11:55.228\nSo with this computer not\nbeing joined in the domain,\n\n216\n00:11:55.228 --> 00:11:57.780\nI was able to log in with\na local administrative account.\n\n217\n00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:02.050\nAnd it's on the same network\nas my Office Pro demo code.\n\n218\n00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.547\nFeature is gonna be.\n\n219\n00:12:03.547 --> 00:12:06.820\nLet me get all this other stuff out of\nthe way to help remind me what it is.\n\n220\n00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.425\nOkay, there we go.\n\n221\n00:12:09.425 --> 00:12:13.590\nI'm gonna select Local Server underneath.\n\n222\n00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.042\nWell right here, under the server manager.\n\n223\n00:12:16.042 --> 00:12:19.045\nAnd then the properties\nof this local server,\n\n224\n00:12:19.045 --> 00:12:23.900\nI had already named it Office 3 or\nO365 Server 01 which is fine.\n\n225\n00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.320\nBut notice this, the workgroup here.\n\n226\n00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.260\n&gt;&gt; A\n&gt;&gt; A.\n\n227\n00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.889\nIf I just click on that.\n\n228\n00:12:29.889 --> 00:12:32.166\nOn this server--\n&gt;&gt; It's like the Pretty Little Liars\n\n229\n00:12:32.166 --> 00:12:33.460\nhandle there.\n\n230\n00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.100\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you.\n\n231\n00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.290\nThank you very much.\n\n232\n00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:37.810\nI appreciate it.\n\n233\n00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.500\nThat shows you how-- everybody\nelse always used to do,\n\n234\n00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.320\nthey would actually literally\nrename it Work Group, right?\n\n235\n00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.250\nI would push one letter,\nto rename the work group.\n\n236\n00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.370\nWhich was just the letter A,\nbecause it was right there.\n\n237\n00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.140\nAs I was reaching-\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like you have an unplanned\n\n238\n00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.432\nrestart, but you're It was planned,\nwe'll just put a P there for Planned.\n\n239\n00:12:54.432 --> 00:12:55.937\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I did, I did that too,\n\n240\n00:12:55.937 --> 00:12:57.620\nbecause I was very simple.\n\n241\n00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.390\nBut, because of the process that I did,\n\n242\n00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.160\nwhere I could reach over\nthose two keyboards.\n\n243\n00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.570\nI was actually able to just go A and\nthen move on.\n\n244\n00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:05.466\nThat's [CROSSTALK].\n\n245\n00:13:05.466 --> 00:13:06.386\n&gt;&gt; It's all about a schedule.\n\n246\n00:13:06.386 --> 00:13:07.954\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It's all about.\n\n247\n00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:10.530\nSo, there we go.\n\n248\n00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:11.970\nFor her it's Pretty Little Liars.\n\n249\n00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.450\nFor me, it's efficiency.\n\n250\n00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:14.720\nThat's what it is.\n\n251\n00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.500\nSo, here it is.\n\n252\n00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.010\nHere's a computer that is\nnot joined to the domain.\n\n253\n00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.770\nIf I click change here, there you go,\nyou'd select it right here and\n\n254\n00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.460\nthere's where you'd enter in that name and\nit'd tell you to reboot.\n\n255\n00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:28.590\nNow, I told you something, I said hey,\nwe're gonna do this using PowerShell.\n\n256\n00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:33.170\nNot this year, so I'm leading you to\nthe wrong path is what I'm telling you.\n\n257\n00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.280\nSo I need to close out the server manager.\n\n258\n00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.590\nThat's exactly what I don't want to do.\n\n259\n00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:42.740\nAnd then, I'm gonna click on the windows\nbutton and of course the powershell.\n\n260\n00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.740\nAnd this one for one reason or\nanother, I'm on a different machine.\n\n261\n00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.530\nI did have it on the right\nfont size weird.\n\n262\n00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.710\nAlright let me verify something here.\n\n263\n00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:52.530\nThat's actually good.\n\n264\n00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.560\nSo let me zoom in, alright.\n\n265\n00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.030\nSo now that I'm at the administrative\nprompt, we want to verify this right here\n\n266\n00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.620\nwhere we are at the powershell\nadministrative prompt.\n\n267\n00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:07.216\nAnd when this is actually done and set,\nI can now go ahead and start typing in,\n\n268\n00:14:07.216 --> 00:14:14.460\nadd-computer and the domain,\n\n269\n00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:23.140\nand this is gonna be\nofficeprodemoco.onmicrosoft.com,\n\n270\n00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.250\nat least I hope that's what it's gonna be.\n\n271\n00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.190\nSo it may not like the onmicrosoft part,\nbut I think it's gonna be fine.\n\n272\n00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.940\nAnd we'll do a restart here.\n\n273\n00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.080\nI pressed enter, now it's asking me for\nsome credentials here.\n\n274\n00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.875\nSo that's gonna be officeprodemoco and\n\n275\n00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:44.400\nthis time I'll select joey,\n\n276\n00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.921\nwho I know is a Domain administrator.\n\n277\n00:14:54.423 --> 00:14:58.739\nAnd in a moment, this machine\nshould go ahead and reboot, and\n\n278\n00:14:58.739 --> 00:15:02.400\nwhen it comes back up,\nit should rejoin the domain.\n\n279\n00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.310\nWe should be ready to go, okay?\n\n280\n00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:08.930\nNow while this is doing its thing,\nand everything else that it has to do,\n\n281\n00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.780\nremember that this might\ntake a couple of times,\n\n282\n00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.880\nespecially if the name was\nthat randomly generated name.\n\n283\n00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.460\nBecause if you're like me, and\nI've done this because I've been working.\n\n284\n00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.681\nI'm not gonna say I was the fastest one,\nbut\n\n285\n00:15:21.681 --> 00:15:27.359\nif I wasn't paying attention It end\nup getting named win-76B549AAA.\n\n286\n00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:28.790\n&gt;&gt; I have a secret,\nthat's the name of my laptop right now.\n\n287\n00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.640\n&gt;&gt; Well good, nice one, okay.\n\n288\n00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.287\nSo there you go.\n\n289\n00:15:33.287 --> 00:15:37.220\n[LAUGH] Well, that's great,\nall right so there we go.\n\n290\n00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:42.503\nSo now here it is,\nthis is a domain joined computer,\n\n291\n00:15:42.503 --> 00:15:48.025\nwell how can I prove that Well I\ncan go to, other user and\n\n292\n00:15:48.025 --> 00:15:52.348\nthen do the Officeprodemo Co backslash and\n\n293\n00:15:52.348 --> 00:15:58.018\nthis time I'll log in as,\nI'll do Lance again, okay?\n\n294\n00:15:58.018 --> 00:15:59.648\nWeird, it's having to\nremember that password.\n\n295\n00:15:59.648 --> 00:16:01.750\nGood Gosh.\n\n296\n00:16:04.017 --> 00:16:06.291\nYeah, I had a bit of a conundrum.\n\n297\n00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:11.250\nI couldn't think of a good name for my PC,\nso I just kept it [LAUGH] at the default.\n\n298\n00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's always awesome.\n\n299\n00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n300\n00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:15.765\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n301\n00:16:15.765 --> 00:16:18.911\nuntil you need to reach\nit [LAUGH] by name.\n\n302\n00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:21.671\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Then you're in trouble, okay?\n\n303\n00:16:21.671 --> 00:16:25.758\nSo, if this is the first time that Lance\nhas logged on as a network administrator,\n\n304\n00:16:25.758 --> 00:16:29.510\nit's gonna create his profile,\nit's gonna do all that, and there it is.\n\n305\n00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.360\nSo now that we're here,\nlet's give it a moment and\n\n306\n00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.490\nlet's check out what we actually do end up\ngetting as a server manager kicks in that\n\n307\n00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:38.850\nwill verify that this is it, okay?\n\n308\n00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.620\nNow while we're actually kind\nof setting this up, and well,\n\n309\n00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.120\nmaybe it's not gonna bring up the server\nmanager, I was hoping it was.\n\n310\n00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:51.570\nOkay, let's also check out this idea\nof that secure channel idea too.\n\n311\n00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:58.470\nSo, maybe not, let me just bring up server\nmanager since it seems to be waiting here.\n\n312\n00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.640\nWhy is this making me do all this?\n\n313\n00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.811\nInteresting, not expecting that.\n\n314\n00:17:06.162 --> 00:17:08.180\nOkay, well, that's unusual.\n\n315\n00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.713\nLet's see,\nmaybe it didn't join itself to domain.\n\n316\n00:17:10.713 --> 00:17:12.080\nLet's take a look here.\n\n317\n00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.360\nWell, that's not good.\n\n318\n00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.019\nIt says unknown, there we go, okay.\n\n319\n00:17:15.019 --> 00:17:15.923\nSo that's actually better.\n\n320\n00:17:15.923 --> 00:17:16.826\n&gt;&gt; So you are part of the domain.\n\n321\n00:17:16.826 --> 00:17:20.400\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so I am part of the domain,\nat least I think I am.\n\n322\n00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:27.081\nIf I go ahead and click and bring this\ninto the computer name here, there we go.\n\n323\n00:17:27.081 --> 00:17:31.837\n&gt;&gt; Someone in the chat also noted\nthe quick little run line shortcut to go\n\n324\n00:17:31.837 --> 00:17:36.270\nahead and pull that window up,\nwhich is going to be sysdm.cpl.\n\n325\n00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.830\nSo that's an old school way of\npulling up that window there, yeah.\n\n326\n00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:40.770\n&gt;&gt; That is definitely true.\n\n327\n00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:45.129\nMy old school way is, I don't know about\nthat one, but getting to that screen where\n\n328\n00:17:45.129 --> 00:17:49.260\nyou change the name is the Windows key\npause break, is kinda the quickest way.\n\n329\n00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:49.970\n&gt;&gt; But I don't have a pause break.\n\n330\n00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.204\n&gt;&gt; I know, we don't have pause\nbreak buttons now, so yeah,\n\n331\n00:17:53.204 --> 00:17:55.360\nwe can't do that very easily.\n\n332\n00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.816\nBut you can see where now this computer is\njoining the domain, I'm getting a little,\n\n333\n00:17:58.816 --> 00:18:01.984\nall right, let's see, refresh, well,\none or more warning message is not so\n\n334\n00:18:01.984 --> 00:18:03.020\nworried about.\n\n335\n00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.450\nBut I am now part of that relationship.\n\n336\n00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.450\nNow remember when I told you\nis that this also depends on\n\n337\n00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:13.650\nwhat we call the Netlogon service, right?\n\n338\n00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:21.030\nSo if I do service.msc of services,\nsee, I can't spell, there we go, wow.\n\n339\n00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.075\nWhy is it doing this to me?\n\n340\n00:18:27.325 --> 00:18:31.400\nI don't know why I'm getting, but\nthat may be just part of it, that'll work.\n\n341\n00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:37.350\nWe're looking for Netlogon services here.\n\n342\n00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.410\nOkay, that is it right here, okay?\n\n343\n00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:44.340\nThis Netlogon service, it gives us\nwhat we call that secure channel.\n\n344\n00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.820\nSecure channel maintains it between this\ncomputer and the domain controller for\n\n345\n00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.190\nauthenticating users and services, okay?\n\n346\n00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:55.720\nIf this is stopped, the computer may\nnot authenticate users and services and\n\n347\n00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.210\nthe domain controller cannot\nregister DNS records.\n\n348\n00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:01.950\nIf the service is disabled, well,\nthat's what you have, okay?\n\n349\n00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.690\nSometimes, if you try and log in to\nthe computer and it tells you the trust\n\n350\n00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:08.660\nrelationship is gone, they're saying,\nI can't establish a secure channel.\n\n351\n00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.180\nRemember that every time\nthat your computer runs,\n\n352\n00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:15.320\nthis is a service that automatically\ncomes up and begins to run.\n\n353\n00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.380\nSo if you ever get to this point where\nyou're going, look, I can log in locally,\n\n354\n00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.010\nbut I can't log in.\n\n355\n00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:28.107\nUsing the domain, you can always\nbring up your PowerShell here.\n\n356\n00:19:28.107 --> 00:19:30.091\nThat's really small, isn't it?\n\n357\n00:19:30.091 --> 00:19:34.955\nGracious, let's change\nthat font size by 9,000.\n\n358\n00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.720\nAnd make that a little bit bigger.\n\n359\n00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.422\n&gt;&gt; Always considerate, Ronnie.\n\n360\n00:19:39.422 --> 00:19:40.900\n&gt;&gt; There we go, I try.\n\n361\n00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:46.950\nAnd then you can run test\n\n362\n00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:54.875\n-ComputerSecureChannel -verbose.\n\n363\n00:19:54.875 --> 00:19:59.760\nAll right, so performing the operation on\nthe target, notice it says true, okay?\n\n364\n00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.950\nSo this actually tells us that the secure\nchannel between the local computer and\n\n365\n00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.580\nthe domain is in good condition.\n\n366\n00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.950\nSo that's a good thing to run without\nyou going is it the secure channel?\n\n367\n00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:12.232\nWell this is a way to\nactually prove whether or\n\n368\n00:20:12.232 --> 00:20:13.983\nnot everything is actually done.\n\n369\n00:20:13.983 --> 00:20:16.748\nNow what if it doesn't, what if it tells\nyou that it's not true, it's false,\n\n370\n00:20:16.748 --> 00:20:17.922\nthat something else is going on?\n\n371\n00:20:17.922 --> 00:20:20.200\nYou have two options here, right?\n\n372\n00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.590\nYou can rejoin the computer domain, that's\nusually the way that I do it, and why?\n\n373\n00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.430\nIt's something I know how to do.\n\n374\n00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:29.132\nIt's easy, I know how to actually\nrejoin the computer domain.\n\n375\n00:20:29.132 --> 00:20:33.356\nIt's probably just second nature to me,\nthat that's what I end up doing.\n\n376\n00:20:33.356 --> 00:20:37.190\nBut if you wanna take the time, you can\nalso go into Active Directory Users and\n\n377\n00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:40.890\nComputers and try and\njust reset the computer account as well.\n\n378\n00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:43.850\nWhen you reset the computer account and\nyou run the same command again,\n\n379\n00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:48.120\nin that way, you can go ahead and\nsee if it actually is working or not.\n\n380\n00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.891\nBut I know, at least from my experience,\n\n381\n00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:55.813\nrejoining the computer to the domain\nhas always worked on the resetting.\n\n382\n00:20:55.813 --> 00:20:58.194\nThere are sometimes I've\nactually gotten them to work,\n\n383\n00:20:58.194 --> 00:21:01.566\nsometimes where it didn't work, which\nmeans it was something besides, what,\n\n384\n00:21:01.566 --> 00:21:04.930\nthe secure channel that ended up\ncausing the issue that you might have.\n\n385\n00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.750\nSo just kinda realize that there are some\nissues when you start doing this\n\n386\n00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.380\ntoo when you take a look, okay?\n\n387\n00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:15.230\nNow, the great thing is, once we're\ndone with that, okay, just like we found\n\n388\n00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.440\nstale user accounts, there is\na possibility that you may have stale\n\n389\n00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.800\ncomputer accounts that you want to be able\nto take a look at and find out as well.\n\n390\n00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.760\nNow in that, the great thing is,\nit can be done, okay?\n\n391\n00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.420\nJust like we saw inside\nof the user accounts,\n\n392\n00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.660\nyou can do kind of the same thing\nin the computer accounts too.\n\n393\n00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.870\nWhen you run something like that,\nit's gonna be a fairly simple command for\n\n394\n00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:41.030\nyou, but you're no longer just\nusing PowerShell at that point.\n\n395\n00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.764\nYou can,\nthere are a couple of different utilities,\n\n396\n00:21:43.764 --> 00:21:47.977\nwe're not gonna get into it right now, but\nyou can actually look those things up.\n\n397\n00:21:47.977 --> 00:21:51.770\nI normally don't find a lot of this,\nbut you can do this.\n\n398\n00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:53.806\nSo you can use a dsquery command,\n\n399\n00:21:53.806 --> 00:21:57.891\nyou can also end up doing a search\nAD account inside of PowerShell.\n\n400\n00:21:57.891 --> 00:22:02.017\nAnd all of that will actually allow you to\nalso try and find those stale accounts,\n\n401\n00:22:02.017 --> 00:22:06.890\nbased on that time limit if you choose to,\nif nobody's actually used that computer.\n\n402\n00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:10.470\nBut as long as you can understand\nthe secure channel, do the domain join,\n\n403\n00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:15.100\nunderstand how to create computer\naccounts, you're probably very good,\n\n404\n00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:20.100\nas far as your Active Directory skills,\nin maintaining and managing those types of\n\n405\n00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:24.240\ncomputer accounts, along with\nyour user account knowledge too.\n\n406\n00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.920\nSo that pretty much wraps it up for\n\n407\n00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.620\nwhat we have in terms of\nmanaging computer accounts.\n\n408\n00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.598\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie, well, thank you for\ntaking the time to show us how to go ahead\n\n409\n00:22:31.598 --> 00:22:33.660\nand create and\nmanage those computer accounts.\n\n410\n00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.710\nFor this show, we'll go ahead and\nsign off, remember, I'm your host,\n\n411\n00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:37.480\nCherokee Boose.\n\n412\n00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.260\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n413\n00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:41.376\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n414\n00:22:41.376 -->

00:00:12.520\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.606\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, and\nthank you for watching ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:15.606 --> 00:00:18.240\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.793\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Windows Server 101.\n\n7\n00:00:22.793 --> 00:00:26.920\nAnd who's bringing us this information,\nthe one and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.620\nAs we talk about managing groups today,\nright, Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.718\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there's no doubt that the idea of\nmanaging groups is an important task for\n\n10\n00:00:33.718 --> 00:00:35.200\nthe server administrator.\n\n11\n00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.140\nIt's something we definitely\nwant to dive into.\n\n12\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.031\nWe already talked about creating\nuser accounts in the past,\n\n13\n00:00:41.031 --> 00:00:42.510\nas well as computer accounts.\n\n14\n00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.170\nAnd now we're starting to move into\nthe idea of groups and it's something that\n\n15\n00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.090\nevery server administrator\nshould be familiar with as well.\n\n16\n00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.490\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwhat are some of the major groups,\n\n17\n00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.450\nthought that was a good\nquestion to start off with.\n\n18\n00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.394\n&gt;&gt; When we start talking\nabout the idea of groups,\n\n19\n00:00:56.394 --> 00:00:58.483\nlet's talk about what\na grouping actually is, and\n\n20\n00:00:58.483 --> 00:01:01.710\nthen we'll talk about some of the major\ngroups that we wanna think about here.\n\n21\n00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.609\nSo, when start talking about\nthe idea of grouping, right now,\n\n22\n00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:10.594\nin terms of what you and I have actually\ndone together for the Server 101 class or\n\n23\n00:01:10.594 --> 00:01:14.950\ncourse that we're having here,\nis we've created individual users.\n\n24\n00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.143\nWe've created individual computers inside\nof that Active Directory management,\n\n25\n00:01:19.143 --> 00:01:22.460\na structure that we have available,\nadministrative structure.\n\n26\n00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.560\nBut it also means that even though I've\ngot those created, currently I am still\n\n27\n00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.170\ngonna be managing individual objects\ninside of my Active Directory network.\n\n28\n00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.410\nNow, that's still one person at a time,\nor one computer at a time,\n\n29\n00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.940\none account at a time.\n\n30\n00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.550\nEverything that I'm having to do\nis still on an individual basis.\n\n31\n00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.561\nSo I'm not really taking advantage of this\nidea of having an administrative domain,\n\n32\n00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:51.820\nin which I can centralize\nsome of those tasks.\n\n33\n00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.503\nGroups help us to be able to essentially\nconfigure, be able to do things or\n\n34\n00:01:57.503 --> 00:02:02.430\napply policy, to more than one user or\ncomputer at a time.\n\n35\n00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.860\nSo that's what we're normally talking\nabout when we start to see that.\n\n36\n00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.045\nNow normally in terms of different groups\nthat are out there, it really depends on\n\n37\n00:02:10.045 --> 00:02:13.441\nwhat the need is of the moment,\non how you create those groups, and\n\n38\n00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:16.690\nwhat groups that you actually\nend up creating as well.\n\n39\n00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.200\nSo that's where we're gonna be jumping\ninto some of those details in this show.\n\n40\n00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.371\n&gt;&gt; So groups can be local,\nthey can be global, domain, I mean,\n\n41\n00:02:24.371 --> 00:02:27.190\nanything you want to group or you need to.\n\n42\n00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.554\n&gt;&gt; Right, it just depends on the function\nthat we actually need to have and\n\n43\n00:02:30.554 --> 00:02:32.810\nbe ready to go, and\nwe are gonna dive into that.\n\n44\n00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.182\nNow before we do that, and take a look\nat some of those elements in there,\n\n45\n00:02:37.182 --> 00:02:41.197\nwe wanna make sure that we understand\nthat you, as a server admin,\n\n46\n00:02:41.197 --> 00:02:45.090\ngetting your access into\nthe Active Directory network.\n\n47\n00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.450\nIt also means that you are going to have\nto be able, of course, to create groups.\n\n48\n00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.034\nYou're gonna have to be able\nto manage those groups and\n\n49\n00:02:52.034 --> 00:02:55.700\nunderstand what they're actually\napplying for or being applied for.\n\n50\n00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.900\nAnd then, of course, troubleshooting the\naccess when things don't end up working.\n\n51\n00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.270\nThose are relatively common\ntasks that we'll end up seeing.\n\n52\n00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.337\nBut when it comes down to creating groups,\nwe do see that there's going to be several\n\n53\n00:03:06.337 --> 00:03:08.530\noptions that Zach has\nbeen mentioning here.\n\n54\n00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.972\nWhich we do need to think about\nthe type of group, as well as\n\n55\n00:03:11.972 --> 00:03:17.120\nthe idea of the scope of the group, and\nwhat those actions actually mean for us.\n\n56\n00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.850\nSo let's go ahead and do that for right\nnow, and let's take a look at my computer.\n\n57\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.070\nI'm gonna launch up\nthe Active Directory Users and\n\n58\n00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.310\nComputers from my remote\nmanagement machine.\n\n59\n00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.036\nBy simply clicking on the Windows button,\nand then from that point I'm\n\n60\n00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:36.150\ngonna scroll down,\ninto the Windows Administrative Tools.\n\n61\n00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.600\nAnd under Administrative Tools,\nI'm going to select Users and Computers.\n\n62\n00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.367\nThis is by far the most commonly accessed\nutility that we'll probably end up using\n\n63\n00:03:45.367 --> 00:03:47.400\nthe majority of the time.\n\n64\n00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.270\nFrom here,\nI'm gonna provide my network credentials,\n\n65\n00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.635\nthat give me the access that I need\nto be able to do this management.\n\n66\n00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:56.883\nIf I can remember my\npassword as I'm talking,\n\n67\n00:03:56.883 --> 00:04:00.982\nwhich is almost difficult enough\nto not be able to do here.\n\n68\n00:04:00.982 --> 00:04:04.217\nSo in just a moment,\nwe'll actually see that, here it is,\n\n69\n00:04:04.217 --> 00:04:07.218\nI'm inside of Active Directory Users and\nComputers.\n\n70\n00:04:07.218 --> 00:04:11.250\nAnd right now you see over here on\nthe left-hand side in the navigation pane,\n\n71\n00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.687\nof course the domain name.\n\n72\n00:04:12.687 --> 00:04:15.910\nAnd then you have this\nstructure that we have here.\n\n73\n00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.054\nThe ones with the additional icon,\n\n74\n00:04:18.054 --> 00:04:22.771\nthese are what we call the organizational\nunits, which we created a little bit\n\n75\n00:04:22.771 --> 00:04:26.900\nearlier in previous episodes\ninside of Active Directory.\n\n76\n00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.041\nBut there are also what we call\ncontainers, and they don't have any actual\n\n77\n00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:36.950\nicon associated with them,\non the folder structure that you see here.\n\n78\n00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.459\nNow, the idea of grouping them\nallows us to be able to take even\n\n79\n00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:44.752\na portion of what we see here,\nand say, hey,\n\n80\n00:04:44.752 --> 00:04:49.510\nI want to essentially treat\nthem as one unit if I need to.\n\n81\n00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.320\nSo let's select where I have\nmost of the things populated,\n\n82\n00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.840\nwhich is inside this Office 365 container,\nthat OU that I have.\n\n83\n00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.940\nAnd it's in here that I can group and\ncreate groups if I want to.\n\n84\n00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.600\nNow, we can do that on anything\nthat we see right here.\n\n85\n00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.350\nNow when you do something like this,\nit's fairly easy to do.\n\n86\n00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.240\nSo let's say, for\n\n87\n00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.710\nexample, I'm trying to think of\nthe one I have the most people in,\n\n88\n00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.810\nwhich might be concert crew, yeah, there\nwe go, we'll use the concert crew OU.\n\n89\n00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.800\nAnd if I wanted to group a certain number\nof these people together, I could.\n\n90\n00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.768\nI simply right-click on the concert crew,\nI can then go down to New,\n\n91\n00:05:26.768 --> 00:05:28.924\nand then I can create a group.\n\n92\n00:05:28.924 --> 00:05:31.601\nNow, when I do so,\nit's not really super fancy, but\n\n93\n00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:34.889\nhere's some of the options that\nwe've been talking about here.\n\n94\n00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.448\nIs that you wanna be able to\nactually have a name, and\n\n95\n00:05:37.448 --> 00:05:40.248\nthen you'll see from that point\nhow to fill out the rest.\n\n96\n00:05:40.248 --> 00:05:44.773\nSo let's say from here,\nwe'll actually create from the,\n\n97\n00:05:44.773 --> 00:05:49.208\nmake sure I'm seeing that right,\nthe concert crew here,\n\n98\n00:05:49.208 --> 00:05:53.570\nwe'll actually create,\nlet's say, the Sound group.\n\n99\n00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.353\nNow, once I do that, it went ahead and,\n\n100\n00:05:55.353 --> 00:05:57.720\nI'm getting a little bit\nlocked up on my screen here.\n\n101\n00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.260\nThere we go, trying to make sure\nI actually don't do that again.\n\n102\n00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.870\nSo here, and\n\n103\n00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.870\nyou'll notice that there's actually some\nof these different objects that we have.\n\n104\n00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.080\nLet's talk about the idea of types first,\nis what we want to do.\n\n105\n00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.110\nSince Zach actually did mention them,\n\n106\n00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.790\nand we'll see what we're\nactually going to do here.\n\n107\n00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.810\nWhen it comes down to different types, the\ndefault one is normally the one that you\n\n108\n00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.330\nsee right here, where it's actually\nmarked in, where it says Security.\n\n109\n00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.710\nNow a security is our default type\nof group that we have set up for\n\n110\n00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.260\nActive Directory, and for\n\n111\n00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.780\neverything else that we create when we\nfirst create the idea of a group type.\n\n112\n00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.680\nNow when you start to see this here,\nthis is normally going to\n\n113\n00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.490\nreally allow us to set up whatever types\nof measures that we want to apply.\n\n114\n00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.706\nSuch as permissions,\nyou name it, it's gonna be here,\n\n115\n00:06:43.706 --> 00:06:46.990\nwhere we can set those things up for\nour Active Directory.\n\n116\n00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.816\nNow let me bring up something else to\nkind of help us out in understanding not\n\n117\n00:06:51.816 --> 00:06:54.660\nonly the groups, but\nwhy we also choose to.\n\n118\n00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.540\nAnd so this is a little bit of a review,\nas we go on to do this.\n\n119\n00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.479\nSo let's take for an example right here on\nthis screen, I have individual users, this\n\n120\n00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:08.620\nrepresents, let's say, these different\nusers that are inside my Active Directory.\n\n121\n00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.978\nSo A, B, C, D, I probably could've\nlisted names, but I was being lazy, and\n\n122\n00:07:12.978 --> 00:07:16.916\nI didn't do that, but now-\n&gt;&gt; No, my parents were gonna name me A,\n\n123\n00:07:16.916 --> 00:07:17.632\nactually.\n\n124\n00:07:17.632 --> 00:07:20.200\n&gt;&gt; That would actually made good sense,\nif we did that.\n\n125\n00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.366\nSo, the good things is that, we actually\ndid choose a male, so that would,\n\n126\n00:07:23.366 --> 00:07:24.160\nyeah, here we go.\n\n127\n00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.900\nSo, here it is, now we actually do have\nthese four different users inside of that\n\n128\n00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.790\nActive Directory structure.\n\n129\n00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.323\nLet's say that we also needed access\nto each one of these eight different\n\n130\n00:07:34.323 --> 00:07:35.375\napplications.\n\n131\n00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:38.072\nBut we also found out something here,\n\n132\n00:07:38.072 --> 00:07:43.650\nthat all eight of those applications\nhave different permissions set on them.\n\n133\n00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.571\nNow, if all four of these users need that,\nthey need to be able to do something\n\n134\n00:07:48.571 --> 00:07:53.367\nlike that, they need to be able to\naccess all eight of these applications.\n\n135\n00:07:53.367 --> 00:07:59.573\nWell, without the idea of grouping It\nreally does only allow me to do one thing.\n\n136\n00:07:59.573 --> 00:08:02.167\nI need to go to every application and\n\n137\n00:08:02.167 --> 00:08:05.980\nattach every individual\nuser to each application.\n\n138\n00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:06.840\n&gt;&gt; One at a time.\n\n139\n00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.680\n&gt;&gt; One at a time.\n\n140\n00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n141\n00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.890\nnow if you take a look at it,\nat least minimally, okay just to do that.\n\n142\n00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.520\nThat's just to place them\nunder that application and\n\n143\n00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.180\nthe permissions list that we have,\nthat's 32 tasks.\n\n144\n00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.290\nThat's not even talking about\nthe level of permission\n\n145\n00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.440\nthat we might actually assign to that.\n\n146\n00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.240\nSo, in this sense right that's\nat least a minimum of 32 tasks.\n\n147\n00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.423\nAnd then we want now to individualized\nit becomes a little bit harder or\n\n148\n00:08:32.423 --> 00:08:35.350\na little bit more information\nthat we have to be able to do.\n\n149\n00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.320\nSo we can do this.\n\n150\n00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.480\nCan you manage active directory that way?\n\n151\n00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.200\nAbsolutely.\n\n152\n00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.530\nWould you ever want to?\n\n153\n00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:42.080\nNever.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n154\n00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.450\n&gt;&gt; That is absolutely the key.\n\n155\n00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.560\nThis is something we\nnever really want to do.\n\n156\n00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.000\nSo, the idea of grouping and\nwhere security groups really come in,\n\n157\n00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.850\nis it gives me the ability to do this\nsame thing, but I can do it in less time.\n\n158\n00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.050\nLet me show you what I'm\ntalking about here, Zach.\n\n159\n00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.350\nSo if I now move,\nI'll say to the second group,\n\n160\n00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:07.150\nnow let's say that I create\na group here called IT Mgrs, okay.\n\n161\n00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.240\nSo here it is, IT Mgrs, and\n\n162\n00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.060\nthey are supposed to have access to\nall eight of these applications.\n\n163\n00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.060\nI have individual different\npermissions to them.\n\n164\n00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.720\nWell, that actually does\nwork out just fine, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.960\nNow, what I do instead is\nthat once I create that and\n\n166\n00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.250\neach of these individual users\nnow are a part of this group,\n\n167\n00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:31.870\nI can now assign those applications,\nthat group.\n\n168\n00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.600\nAnd then, that means all the permission\non all eight of those applications\n\n169\n00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.670\neven though they're different,\nthey'll apply to every one in this group.\n\n170\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.980\nSo now, notice in comparisons app, okay?\n\n171\n00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.340\nRemember I told you that.\n\n172\n00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.354\nBy default, this is at least 32,\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n173\n00:09:46.354 --> 00:09:50.370\n&gt;&gt; Okay, of individual tasks that\nwe would have to be able to do.\n\n174\n00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.740\nThis one, at the minimal, right, is eight.\n\n175\n00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.352\nSo you can see-\n&gt;&gt; That's more better.\n\n176\n00:09:57.352 --> 00:09:58.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n177\n00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.522\nYou can see the efficiency and\nthe idea behind using this group.\n\n178\n00:10:01.522 --> 00:10:03.862\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nNow, the other thing though Zach,\n\n179\n00:10:03.862 --> 00:10:07.876\nis I didn't do it on this particular\nscreen but lets say that now Zach,\n\n180\n00:10:07.876 --> 00:10:10.956\nwe'll do the letter for\nZach instead of giving him A.\n\n181\n00:10:10.956 --> 00:10:12.141\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Even though\n\n182\n00:10:12.141 --> 00:10:13.743\nthat was his parents\nintention according to Zach.\n\n183\n00:10:13.743 --> 00:10:15.228\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's do the letter Z.\n\n184\n00:10:15.228 --> 00:10:18.378\nIf we were to add Zach into\nthis particular group here,\n\n185\n00:10:18.378 --> 00:10:20.880\nwell that would be an additional what?\n\n186\n00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.600\nEight tasks, right,\nthat we would have to be able to do.\n\n187\n00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.850\nNow the neat thing is, okay with that,\nwe start adding that right so\n\n188\n00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:33.610\nevery single user then that we add in to\nthat needs access to these applications.\n\n189\n00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.130\nEssentially is eight more tasks per user.\n\n190\n00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.464\nWell, Zach, the only thing that I have\nto do here is if I can adjust this,\n\n191\n00:10:39.464 --> 00:10:42.650\nI have to kinda get out of this\nsetting for a moment here.\n\n192\n00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:47.020\nAnd let me see if I can change this up for\njust a moment and move this over.\n\n193\n00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:53.270\nSo now, if E and\nF are going to be added in for\n\n194\n00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:58.890\nthese, I don't have to actually add E\ndown here and F down here at the bottom.\n\n195\n00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.820\nI simply change the group by\nadding them into the group.\n\n196\n00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.190\nSo now when I do that, notice, Zach,\nthat that's actually just one other task.\n\n197\n00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.890\nOkay?\n\n198\n00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.640\nSo one other one.\n\n199\n00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.060\nAnd then if I wanted to add in F,\n\n200\n00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:16.380\nit would actually be two other tasks\nthat I would end up having instead.\n\n201\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.140\nSo now when we take a look here,\n\n202\n00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.610\nthat now actually indicates that\ninstead of me having just a task,\n\n203\n00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:29.785\nI could add in additional numbers of users\nhere by simply doing two extra tasks.\n\n204\n00:11:29.785 --> 00:11:32.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Adding E and F into the group.\n\n205\n00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:37.129\nBut now it automatically placed them\ninside of what we see down here.\n\n206\n00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:43.730\nSo this gives you the overall benefit\nof why we want to create groups,\n\n207\n00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.880\nto be able to help us to manage\nthings inside of active directory.\n\n208\n00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.880\nSo in this sense, when we start to\nsee this, it really does give us\n\n209\n00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.305\nan understanding of why groups are at\nleast minimally valuable to us.\n\n210\n00:11:56.305 --> 00:12:00.040\nIt not actually very important to\nwhat we do on a daily basis and\n\n211\n00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.280\nthis is something we\nreally do end up seeing.\n\n212\n00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.753\nAnd most active directory structures that\nyou and I are probably gonna end up,\n\n213\n00:12:06.753 --> 00:12:09.143\nyou know getting hired into and working.\n\n214\n00:12:09.143 --> 00:12:13.955\nYou're gonna see more groups\nin there then you're gonna see\n\n215\n00:12:13.955 --> 00:12:19.631\nindividuals attached to folders or\nyou know, individual resources.\n\n216\n00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:21.231\nYou're gonna see actual groups.\n\n217\n00:12:21.231 --> 00:12:23.783\nWhy?\nBecause if they hire 50 people at one\n\n218\n00:12:23.783 --> 00:12:27.847\ntime, and they're all supposed to\nget access to this one application,\n\n219\n00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:31.650\nthey don't wanna add in 50\npeople to that one application.\n\n220\n00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.510\nThey just want to add you into that group,\nand then, that way,\n\n221\n00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.340\nit also becomes easier, too, Zach.\n\n222\n00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.370\nWhat happens, let's say, Zach,\nI'm gonna see if you can figure this out.\n\n223\n00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.010\nSo if I now, if I had only did this.\n\n224\n00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:43.570\nOkay?\n\n225\n00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:44.750\nAnd let's say that E and\n\n226\n00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.830\nF is down here at the bottom,\nand if we kinda think about that.\n\n227\n00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:54.210\nIf now F somehow gets A termination event,\nright?\n\n228\n00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:54.880\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n229\n00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:55.640\n&gt;&gt; Well, it means,\n\n230\n00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.820\nI also have to think about that too,\nright?\n\n231\n00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.780\nThe very fact that F or\n\n232\n00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:04.680\nE has terminated, that means I have to\ngo into every object that I've attached.\n\n233\n00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.428\nEach one of those people too, and do what?\n\n234\n00:13:06.428 --> 00:13:07.392\nRemove them.\n\n235\n00:13:07.392 --> 00:13:07.970\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n236\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.480\n&gt;&gt; Off of those objects.\n\n237\n00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.185\nOr their particular account will\nstill retain those permissions.\n\n238\n00:13:12.185 --> 00:13:14.560\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It's never a good thing, but\n\n239\n00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.700\nif I do this in the group right here,\nit's fairly easy.\n\n240\n00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.370\nLet me go back to the editing screen here.\n\n241\n00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:28.820\nI simply can go ahead and do this, and now\nif I come back to the presentation screen.\n\n242\n00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.970\nNow notice,\nF automatically is removed here, and\n\n243\n00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:36.540\nI didn't actually have to go into\nevery single object to remove them.\n\n244\n00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.650\nI simply went to that group and\nI removed that person from that group.\n\n245\n00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:45.560\nSo that's why this particular concept\nis a very important concept for us to\n\n246\n00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.360\nunderstand when we start talking about\ngrouping and where they're actually used.\n\n247\n00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.280\nOkay, so that's actually\ngonna be helpful for us too.\n\n248\n00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.290\n&gt;&gt; I think that would be very helpful\nto the administrators as well.\n\n249\n00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.020\nWhich actually kinda leads\nme up to another question,\n\n250\n00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.480\nI don't know if you're ready for\nthis one or not.\n\n251\n00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.250\nBut what are some of the typical\nduties of the administrator?\n\n252\n00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; When it comes to managing all of these.\n\n253\n00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.680\n&gt;&gt; Well, remember that this is\npart of that management, right?\n\n254\n00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.300\nIs being able to remove and being able\nto add people into the objects that\n\n255\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.010\nthey're supposed to be able to get access\nto, so just like what we're doing here.\n\n256\n00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.780\nBut also being able to\ncreate the groups as needed.\n\n257\n00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.564\nSo, if I get a new resource that comes\nonline, and I go, look here it is,\n\n258\n00:14:20.564 --> 00:14:24.224\nZach and his team, they need access\nto one of these three resources but\n\n259\n00:14:24.224 --> 00:14:28.630\nthey don't need access to everything,\nokay, well even though that might be true,\n\n260\n00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.760\neven though Zach might not\nactually be able to do that.\n\n261\n00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.670\nWhat I can do is,\nI can actually assign Zach to a group, and\n\n262\n00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.740\nthen on each of those\nindividual three resources,\n\n263\n00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:41.615\nI can assign how much access that they\nneed, or what access they don't need\n\n264\n00:14:41.615 --> 00:14:45.345\nto be able to limit them without actually\nhaving to change everything and trying\n\n265\n00:14:45.345 --> 00:14:49.405\nto figure out the minutia in the detail\nand the puzzle pieces and way they fit up.\n\n266\n00:14:49.405 --> 00:14:52.765\n&gt;&gt; So there really is no limit to the\nnumber of groups that you could create,\n\n267\n00:14:52.765 --> 00:14:53.665\ntheoretically?\n\n268\n00:14:53.665 --> 00:14:55.275\n&gt;&gt; Well, not normally, okay.\n\n269\n00:14:55.275 --> 00:14:56.265\nIf there is,\n\n270\n00:14:56.265 --> 00:14:58.245\nit's like a prior over the 100 thousands,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n271\n00:14:58.245 --> 00:15:00.840\n&gt;&gt; If not in the millions at this point.\n\n272\n00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.790\nBut most organizations,\nthe idea of creating the group though is\n\n273\n00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.750\nreally dependent on the function that we\nneed and the security that we need, too.\n\n274\n00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.390\nAnd hence, the idea of security groups\n\n275\n00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.270\nis what we're actually talking about here,\nokay?\n\n276\n00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.370\nSo that's what we wanted\nyou to see right here.\n\n277\n00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:17.260\nSo on this one,\n\n278\n00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.244\nif I go back to this group here, and\nlet's focus in a little bit more.\n\n279\n00:15:21.244 --> 00:15:22.885\nThe default one is Security group,\n\n280\n00:15:22.885 --> 00:15:25.958\ncuz that's what they're expecting\nus to end up being able to use.\n\n281\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.730\nNow, there is another one that's right\nhere, which is called Distribution group.\n\n282\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.680\nNow Zach,\njust thinking about the word distribution,\n\n283\n00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:37.565\nit should kind of hint to you why we would\ncreate a group like this, but it may not.\n\n284\n00:15:37.565 --> 00:15:40.860\nBecause this also confused me the first\ntime when I heard I was like,\n\n285\n00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.740\nwhy would I create a group\njust to do distribution to.\n\n286\n00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.305\nWell, this is really\nabout that idea of email.\n\n287\n00:15:47.305 --> 00:15:51.130\nIf you're creating a group just so\nthat you can actually email everybody in\n\n288\n00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:54.177\nthe group, this is another way\nthat you can do that, okay?\n\n289\n00:15:54.177 --> 00:15:57.173\nSo use to be able to send email\nto every user in the group.\n\n290\n00:15:57.173 --> 00:15:59.816\nBut really only setting\nit to one email address.\n\n291\n00:15:59.816 --> 00:16:03.620\nIf not, remember if I opened up an email,\nand Zach has ten people on his team.\n\n292\n00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.219\nI have to add Zach in and\nthe other nine people in.\n\n293\n00:16:06.219 --> 00:16:08.655\nAnd then, what if Ronnie forgets one, and\n\n294\n00:16:08.655 --> 00:16:12.800\nnow all of a sudden that person\nfeels left out, you get the picture.\n\n295\n00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.570\nAnd it's never a good thing, but\nat this point if I go ahead and create\n\n296\n00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:21.430\na distribution group, well, that changes\nthe context of where we would use this.\n\n297\n00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.700\nSo this is normally reserved a lot of\ntimes for being able to distribute or\n\n298\n00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.040\nsend email to that individual\ngroup is what we want app.\n\n299\n00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.180\n&gt;&gt; So if we remember distribution,\ncommunication, email, put it all together.\n\n300\n00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.870\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and\nthat's normally what we would want, right?\n\n301\n00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.780\nSo remember probably,\nI'm gonna say probably,\n\n302\n00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:43.650\nI can't say always find the majority a\ntimes that we're actually creating a group\n\n303\n00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:45.190\nfor assigning permissions.\n\n304\n00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.630\nIf somebody's saying okay we need to\nlimit access to Zach's group, okay.\n\n305\n00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.700\nWell, we're gonna create a security group.\n\n306\n00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.030\nBut if I'm saying all right\nhere's what I need to do,\n\n307\n00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:59.780\nI need to be able to send an email every\nweek, a weekly email to Zach's team.\n\n308\n00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.155\nWell then creating a distribution\ngroup would actually probably\n\n309\n00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:04.388\nbe the way to go, okay?\n\n310\n00:17:04.388 --> 00:17:06.970\nSo it really does depend on your function.\n\n311\n00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:08.820\nNow, you're saying, Ronnie,\ngo ahead and click OK.\n\n312\n00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:12.746\nNot yet, because we haven't even talked\nabout this idea of the group scope\n\n313\n00:17:12.746 --> 00:17:13.440\nyet, okay?\n\n314\n00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.318\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna ask you\nabout group scope, actually.\n\n315\n00:17:15.318 --> 00:17:15.818\n&gt;&gt; Yeah-\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n316\n00:17:15.818 --> 00:17:17.776\n&gt;&gt; Actually this is kind a some that we\n\n317\n00:17:17.776 --> 00:17:21.880\nreally do need to understand and\ndo when we start to take a look here.\n\n318\n00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.950\nGroup scope is exactly like the term says.\n\n319\n00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:31.150\nThe limitation, or the boundary, of what\nthis can actually end up doing, okay?\n\n320\n00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:35.991\nSo when we clicked on this right,\nit create, it gave us a default grouping,\n\n321\n00:17:35.991 --> 00:17:38.271\na group type, which was security.\n\n322\n00:17:38.271 --> 00:17:41.928\nBut notice it didn't put that first\none in the check mark here is\n\n323\n00:17:41.928 --> 00:17:45.890\nlisted in alphabetical order\nIt says global group, okay?\n\n324\n00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:49.920\nSo what is the extended limit\nthat this group actually has?\n\n325\n00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.270\nWhat is the limitation that we have here?\n\n326\n00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:57.920\nWhenever you actually create what\nwe call the idea of a global group,\n\n327\n00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.890\nthis indicates that we actually\ndo need to understand something.\n\n328\n00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:06.052\nAnything that can be placed in this\nparticular group, every member of it,\n\n329\n00:18:06.052 --> 00:18:09.554\nwhether it's the computer or\nuser or even additional groups,\n\n330\n00:18:09.554 --> 00:18:12.477\nwhich you can actually add into it,\nanother group.\n\n331\n00:18:12.477 --> 00:18:15.330\nI know it's strange,\nyou can actually nest groups together.\n\n332\n00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:20.560\nBut anything that you add in,\nit has to come from that domain, okay?\n\n333\n00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.140\nSo everybody that's actually\npart of that domain.\n\n334\n00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.530\nSo you are saying, everybody that's in\nthis group, they're actually a member or\n\n335\n00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.720\nthey're actually domain join,\nthey got an account right here.\n\n336\n00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.230\nThey have an account right here\nin this particular domain, okay?\n\n337\n00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.039\nSo for me as the office pro demo\nco-according to what I have as long\n\n338\n00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:41.662\nas their account has that is\nattached to it, then we are fine.\n\n339\n00:18:41.662 --> 00:18:44.866\nThat's the idea of\nthe domain permissions or\n\n340\n00:18:44.866 --> 00:18:49.860\ndomain global, excuse me,\nthe global's group, global's group.\n\n341\n00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:50.660\n&gt;&gt; Global group.\n\n342\n00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.349\n&gt;&gt; Global group,\nyeah which I can't say, okay the scope.\n\n343\n00:18:53.349 --> 00:18:54.181\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's Friday.\n\n344\n00:18:54.181 --> 00:18:55.604\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in this Friday,-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n345\n00:18:55.604 --> 00:18:56.468\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n346\n00:18:56.468 --> 00:19:00.257\n&gt;&gt; Now, when you do this though,\nonce this is done,\n\n347\n00:19:00.257 --> 00:19:03.885\nthis also means that when we apply this,\nokay?\n\n348\n00:19:03.885 --> 00:19:07.214\nWhen we attach that group to an object,\nright?\n\n349\n00:19:07.214 --> 00:19:10.051\nPermissions assigned to the group, okay,\n\n350\n00:19:10.051 --> 00:19:14.275\ncan actually be from any domain\nthat's actually in that forest.\n\n351\n00:19:14.275 --> 00:19:19.491\nSo you can actually take the entire global\ngroup as long as seen that same domain and\n\n352\n00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:21.774\nforest, you're perfectly fine.\n\n353\n00:19:21.774 --> 00:19:25.364\nSo normally this limits us\nessentially to that one domain.\n\n354\n00:19:25.364 --> 00:19:26.582\nNow earlier in time,\n\n355\n00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:31.195\nwe had also mentioned this, that's\nkind of zoomed in pretty harsh, okay?\n\n356\n00:19:31.195 --> 00:19:35.313\nWe had also mentioned the idea\nof the domain, right?\n\n357\n00:19:35.313 --> 00:19:38.221\nSo remember that if we have this, okay,\n\n358\n00:19:38.221 --> 00:19:42.683\na single domain is essentially\nan administrative boundary.\n\n359\n00:19:42.683 --> 00:19:44.774\nOkay, that's what we have it, okay?\n\n360\n00:19:44.774 --> 00:19:49.500\nThis red circle here represents\nwhat we call the forest, okay?\n\n361\n00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.950\nNow the forest is actually\na security boundary for us.\n\n362\n00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:56.890\nIt is very possible,\nlike I have drawn right here, okay?\n\n363\n00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:01.230\nThat a single forest could\nonly contain a single domain.\n\n364\n00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.480\nIt's very possible that we can do that.\n\n365\n00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.390\nBut the other aspect of this,\nlet me get back to that here.\n\n366\n00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:15.090\nIs that this particular forest though\ncan contain multiple domains as well.\n\n367\n00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:22.775\nAnd this can now extend out to\nbecome that forest too, okay?\n\n368\n00:20:22.775 --> 00:20:27.404\nSo this way we can actually do\nsomething like this if we choose to.\n\n369\n00:20:27.404 --> 00:20:31.287\nThe majority of the time most of us will\nprobably end up seeing in the work place\n\n370\n00:20:31.287 --> 00:20:34.154\nthat we have, unless we work for\na really large company,\n\n371\n00:20:34.154 --> 00:20:37.590\nwe'll probably end up seeing our\nforest is really only one domain.\n\n372\n00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:38.320\n&gt;&gt; Just a domain.\n\n373\n00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.110\n&gt;&gt; That's probably what we'll end up\nseeing, but if you do extend it out,\n\n374\n00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.310\nremember the key here is that they'll\nshare the same name space, so\n\n375\n00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:51.220\njust like you see here, ITProTV, ITProTV,\nITProTV, these two are child domains.\n\n376\n00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:55.740\nThey've essentially added on an extra\nprefix up here at the beginning,\n\n377\n00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.230\nin terms of their domain names.\n\n378\n00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:59.491\nThey are separate domains but\n\n379\n00:20:59.491 --> 00:21:05.467\nnow the security boundary can go out a lot\nfurther so this is why a global group.\n\n380\n00:21:05.467 --> 00:21:09.833\nAnd the way that I described it,\nlet me make sure I read it correctly,\n\n381\n00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:14.470\npermissions assigned to a group,\nokay, from any domain in the forest.\n\n382\n00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:19.070\nSo even though I can create a global\ngroup that has all members of the same\n\n383\n00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:22.650\nindividuals in one domain,\nthose can actually be assigned,\n\n384\n00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.720\nagain, to, well, or permissions from\n\n385\n00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.520\nany domain that's actually in that\nentire forest if we choose to.\n\n386\n00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.390\nSo that's what we have now, I'm starting\nto, I was trying to see what was behind\n\n387\n00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.800\nthese arrows here, it's because\neverything kind of went off the page.\n\n388\n00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:41.570\nThat's what I wanted, see if I pull that\nup a little bit farther, there we go.\n\n389\n00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:43.680\nSo that's where we have\nthat security boundary.\n\n390\n00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.380\nSo with the group type of security,\n\n391\n00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:51.480\nokay, that means its boundary\nis what the whole forest.\n\n392\n00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:57.270\nBut in terms of the group scope right,\nit is global and the very fact that\n\n393\n00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:01.930\nmeans everybody that's part of that group\ncan only be from one of these domains.\n\n394\n00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:06.090\nOkay, so that is a key for us to remember.\n\n395\n00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:09.610\nNow, along with that notice that\nthere is also domain local.\n\n396\n00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:11.233\nOops, let me zoom in so\nwe can see it, geez.\n\n397\n00:22:11.233 --> 00:22:12.630\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n398\n00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.058\n&gt;&gt; Domain local here is another one that\n\n399\n00:22:15.058 --> 00:22:16.100\nyou see.\n\n400\n00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:21.464\nNow domain local,\nthis is kind of an unusual one, okay.\n\n401\n00:22:21.464 --> 00:22:26.410\nDomain local it sounds like, okay domain\nlocally does that mean it's limiting even\n\n402\n00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.900\nfurther, want not necessarily.\n\n403\n00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.380\nA domain local groups scope\nthat you create here,\n\n404\n00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:38.240\nthis can actually contain members from any\ndomain within the entire forest, okay?\n\n405\n00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:42.780\nNow, once you actually have something like\nthat, this also means that other domain\n\n406\n00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:47.860\nlocal groups can be members of other\ndomain local groups here, okay?\n\n407\n00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:52.210\nBut on this one though,\npermissions that you assign to an object.\n\n408\n00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:55.850\nSo if you create a domain local group,\nwherever you created that,\n\n409\n00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:57.608\nif I created an ITProTV, okay?\n\n410\n00:22:57.608 --> 00:23:01.590\nITPro.TV and I had a printer\nthat we all want to access,\n\n411\n00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:05.170\nthat I want anybody in\nthat group to access.\n\n412\n00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.284\nWell, wherever I created\nthat domain local group,\n\n413\n00:23:08.284 --> 00:23:11.478\nthat printer also has to be\nin the same domain, okay?\n\n414\n00:23:11.478 --> 00:23:16.434\nNow remember anybody and anyone of\nthose three domains that I had set up\n\n415\n00:23:16.434 --> 00:23:21.555\nhere inside, dang, there we go,\ninside of Active Directory.\n\n416\n00:23:21.555 --> 00:23:25.690\nAnyone of those three okay, they can be\npart of that domain local group okay?\n\n417\n00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:29.350\nBut it's not going to\nend up doing anything.\n\n418\n00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:33.730\nIf I don't have the resource in the same\ndomain as where this is created.\n\n419\n00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:37.921\nNow, I have a better diagram to kind of\nhelp us to explain this a little bit more\n\n420\n00:23:37.921 --> 00:23:39.676\nbut a little bit large here too.\n\n421\n00:23:39.676 --> 00:23:44.391\nNow, let's zoom in and get a reminder\nbefore we go out here, right?\n\n422\n00:23:44.391 --> 00:23:49.238\nSo traditionally here it is a global\ngroup I've tried to color code this to\n\n423\n00:23:49.238 --> 00:23:50.106\nhelp us out.\n\n424\n00:23:50.106 --> 00:23:54.898\nEverybody in that particular group noticed\nthat they are all the same color which\n\n425\n00:23:54.898 --> 00:23:59.072\nmeans that for us In this one,\nin that light green one that we see here.\n\n426\n00:23:59.072 --> 00:24:03.883\nAs long as they're members of\nthat same domain, itpro.tv,\n\n427\n00:24:03.883 --> 00:24:07.220\nthen they will be able to access whatever.\n\n428\n00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.880\nNow, we don't talk about permissions so\nmuch, but let's say it's to this printer.\n\n429\n00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.437\nThat's fine, they can do that, but\nremember that anybody, any other domain,\n\n430\n00:24:15.437 --> 00:24:18.466\ncan also assign some security\nif they want to as well.\n\n431\n00:24:18.466 --> 00:24:22.693\nIn the domain local, let's take a look\ndown here if I can get this zoomed in down\n\n432\n00:24:22.693 --> 00:24:24.800\nhere a little bit more, okay.\n\n433\n00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.685\nSo this one is the domain local.\n\n434\n00:24:26.685 --> 00:24:29.800\nNotice that you see two\ndifferent colors here.\n\n435\n00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.152\nSo I have somebody from this domain,\nwhich is right here, and\n\n436\n00:24:33.152 --> 00:24:37.349\nthen somebody from the dev domain which\nis over on the right hand side of this.\n\n437\n00:24:37.349 --> 00:24:42.455\nThey're part of this domain local group\nand if this group is assigning permission\n\n438\n00:24:42.455 --> 00:24:47.930\nto get access to this server over here for\na fall server for wherever it might be.\n\n439\n00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:52.142\nWell as long as this domain group or\nthis domain local group is in\n\n440\n00:24:52.142 --> 00:24:55.966\nthe same domain as the resource\nthat will work just fine.\n\n441\n00:24:55.966 --> 00:24:59.298\nIt doesn't matter who else\nyou put in this group okay?\n\n442\n00:24:59.298 --> 00:25:02.178\nAs long as they're actually in that\nsame forest, you're perfectly fine.\n\n443\n00:25:02.178 --> 00:25:04.673\nNow, can these actually\nexist in the same domain?\n\n444\n00:25:04.673 --> 00:25:10.267\nYeah, you can create a domain global\ngroup, as well as a domain local group,\n\n445\n00:25:10.267 --> 00:25:14.530\ntoo, and\nthey can exist inside the same forest.\n\n446\n00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:18.818\nNow, the last option that we saw,\nand we'll come back to this\n\n447\n00:25:18.818 --> 00:25:23.374\nvery quickly here is of course\nthe universal group scope, okay?\n\n448\n00:25:23.374 --> 00:25:27.514\nNow, with the universal group scope,\nthis is a little bit easier to understand,\n\n449\n00:25:27.514 --> 00:25:28.660\nat least for me it was.\n\n450\n00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.619\nIt may not be for everybody.\n\n451\n00:25:30.619 --> 00:25:33.980\nBut let's say thea we have\na SharePoint site, okay.\n\n452\n00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:39.799\nThat everybody, so one in the ITProTV or\nyou're in the lab.itprotv domain or\n\n453\n00:25:39.799 --> 00:25:46.252\nthe dev.itprotv domain and you have people\nthat need access to that SharePoint site.\n\n454\n00:25:46.252 --> 00:25:49.350\nBut you're not as you're crediting\nthree different SharePoint sites.\n\n455\n00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.903\nWell, we can do this.\n\n456\n00:25:50.903 --> 00:25:54.170\nWe can create what's called\na universal group and\n\n457\n00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:58.250\nnotice it doesn't matter\nwhere the members are, okay?\n\n458\n00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:02.482\nSo they can be in any domain inside of\nthat forest, and we can create that.\n\n459\n00:26:02.482 --> 00:26:06.773\nAnd then, they can get access to such\na core resource that we have available to\n\n460\n00:26:06.773 --> 00:26:09.670\neverybody throughout the organization.\n\n461\n00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:14.429\nSo it doesn't matter if that SharePoint\nsite resides here, here, or here.\n\n462\n00:26:14.429 --> 00:26:19.451\nI can actually say hey,\nwe want to make sure that everybody has\n\n463\n00:26:19.451 --> 00:26:25.310\nthat ability to do so to provide\nthat access and that permission.\n\n464\n00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.054\nThe whole goal behind this is so\n\n465\n00:26:27.054 --> 00:26:31.023\nthat I'm not assigning Zach every\nlevel of permission that he needs.\n\n466\n00:26:31.023 --> 00:26:34.638\nI can now actually remove Zack from the\nuniversal group if he doesn't need that\n\n467\n00:26:34.638 --> 00:26:35.510\nanymore.\n\n468\n00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:39.352\nOr I could place him inside of this global\ngroup to limit him access to what I need,\n\n469\n00:26:39.352 --> 00:26:41.288\nor I can place him in domain local group.\n\n470\n00:26:41.288 --> 00:26:44.708\nI'm not changing every time\nthat Zack happens to move or\n\n471\n00:26:44.708 --> 00:26:47.420\nhappens to not be in part of the group.\n\n472\n00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:50.541\nI just simply remove him from that group\nand that takes away his permissions or\n\n473\n00:26:50.541 --> 00:26:53.230\nI add him into that group it gives\nhim permissions into that group is\n\n474\n00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:53.825\nwhat we have.\n\n475\n00:26:53.825 --> 00:26:57.790\n&gt;&gt; So that is, in essence, like having\ngroups, within groups, within groups.\n\n476\n00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:59.797\n&gt;&gt; It can be, yeah, it can be.\n\n477\n00:26:59.797 --> 00:27:02.606\nThe very fact is it depends\non the context that we need.\n\n478\n00:27:02.606 --> 00:27:04.686\nSo we can nest groups if we want to.\n\n479\n00:27:04.686 --> 00:27:05.385\n&gt;&gt; Nesting groups, right.\n\n480\n00:27:05.385 --> 00:27:08.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can create these\nglobal groups here, okay?\n\n481\n00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:09.406\nSo, just like we have.\n\n482\n00:27:09.406 --> 00:27:13.560\nLet's say that this global group up here\nin itpro.tv, it's for the HR department.\n\n483\n00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.545\nAnd this one down here In lab\nis also the HR department.\n\n484\n00:27:17.545 --> 00:27:19.970\nThis one over here in dev\npro is the HR department.\n\n485\n00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:25.397\nWell, we can make that group a part\nof this universal group here.\n\n486\n00:27:25.397 --> 00:27:29.680\nAnd that means everybody in those groups\nwill get access to that SharePoint site.\n\n487\n00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.442\nSo we can do that.\n\n488\n00:27:31.442 --> 00:27:35.744\nEven though I only have users here,\nwe can actually again create those groups\n\n489\n00:27:35.744 --> 00:27:40.044\nthat will give us the ability to add\nin users, computers, as well as groups,\n\n490\n00:27:40.044 --> 00:27:41.480\nif we choose to.\n\n491\n00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.144\nSo that is kinda the key for\n\n492\n00:27:43.144 --> 00:27:47.693\nus in understanding at least the basics\nin terms of groups that we have.\n\n493\n00:27:47.693 --> 00:27:52.725\nNow, when we start to see this here,\nthere is some basic guidelines\n\n494\n00:27:52.725 --> 00:27:58.810\non the group creation that we want to\nmake sure that we understand, okay?\n\n495\n00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:03.660\nNow, when we start saying, all right,\nwhen I need to create a global group,\n\n496\n00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.036\nwhat should I actually think\nabout when I create one?\n\n497\n00:28:07.036 --> 00:28:09.555\nIs it just because I wanna name one pink?\n\n498\n00:28:09.555 --> 00:28:12.510\nNo, that's not the whole goal and idea.\n\n499\n00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.120\n&gt;&gt; Pink's not a bad color.\n\n500\n00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.974\n&gt;&gt; It's not a bad color, but the idea\nof creating groups is because there's\n\n501\n00:28:16.974 --> 00:28:19.102\na functionality that you need, right?\n\n502\n00:28:19.102 --> 00:28:19.952\nIn other words,\n\n503\n00:28:19.952 --> 00:28:24.220\nthink about a role, when people have\nsimilar roles together that they're doing.\n\n504\n00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:29.132\nSo, for example, Zach and I, we're part\nof the host group here at ITProTV.\n\n505\n00:28:29.132 --> 00:28:33.747\nAnd when we do that right, that means that\nwe're actually doing it because we believe\n\n506\n00:28:33.747 --> 00:28:37.976\nthat all the people that are hosts here\nat ITProTV, or educators I should say,\n\n507\n00:28:37.976 --> 00:28:39.280\nat ITProTV.\n\n508\n00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.244\nIt's because we are actually created for\nthat role, okay.\n\n509\n00:28:42.244 --> 00:28:46.008\nSo that group, as long as we need to\nbe able to apply security just to those\n\n510\n00:28:46.008 --> 00:28:49.620\nroles, well that's what we're\nnormally thinking about.\n\n511\n00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:54.267\nSo that is a thumb, a rule of thumb,\nif you want to take a look at it that way.\n\n512\n00:28:54.267 --> 00:28:57.422\nGrouping users together that\nhave similar job roles,\n\n513\n00:28:57.422 --> 00:29:00.810\npretty much the key idea\nin terms of global groups.\n\n514\n00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:02.772\nFor the domain local group,\n\n515\n00:29:02.772 --> 00:29:07.677\nyou wanna make sure that as you actually\nyou do use domain local groups,\n\n516\n00:29:07.677 --> 00:29:12.337\nnormally the best practice here is\nthat when you do have a resource,\n\n517\n00:29:12.337 --> 00:29:16.870\nthat you want to assign permissions so\nthat people can access it.\n\n518\n00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:19.590\nSo you create a resource,\nlet's say like a printer.\n\n519\n00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:23.862\nAnd then you create a domain local group,\nand you make that as being one of\n\n520\n00:29:23.862 --> 00:29:27.365\nthe groups that are actually\npart of the permissions list,\n\n521\n00:29:27.365 --> 00:29:28.924\nthe ACL on that resource.\n\n522\n00:29:28.924 --> 00:29:32.645\nAnd that way, it doesn't matter\nwho you assign inside that forest.\n\n523\n00:29:32.645 --> 00:29:34.134\nThey’re gonna be able to get access to it.\n\n524\n00:29:34.134 --> 00:29:37.837\nIf you don’t, you're gonna put that into a\nglobal group which means you have to make\n\n525\n00:29:37.837 --> 00:29:40.040\nthem a member of the domain\nbefore you can do that.\n\n526\n00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.344\nWhen they're not a member of the domain,\n\n527\n00:29:41.344 --> 00:29:43.310\nwell that becomes a little\nbit more confusing.\n\n528\n00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:47.043\nSo if you do have resources,\nclearly the idea here- try and\n\n529\n00:29:47.043 --> 00:29:49.067\nuse a domain local group for it.\n\n530\n00:29:49.067 --> 00:29:52.480\nBut global groups are probably\nwhat we're gonna see more often.\n\n531\n00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.715\nAnd really, at the beginning level, right,\nlike here at Server 101, global groups\n\n532\n00:29:56.715 --> 00:30:00.506\nare probably the scope that you and I are\nprobably gonna use more often than not.\n\n533\n00:30:00.506 --> 00:30:04.410\nBut there's still plenty to go\non managing groups here, Zack.\n\n534\n00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:07.613\nBut the problem is,\nI've talked a long time again, and\n\n535\n00:30:07.613 --> 00:30:10.693\nthat means I am not going to\nfinish it in this episode.\n\n536\n00:30:10.693 --> 00:30:12.185\n&gt;&gt; No, Ronnie, we appreciate it, and\n\n537\n00:30:12.185 --> 00:30:14.730\nwe appreciate you taking\nthe time to uncover everything.\n\n538\n00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.477\nThere's no rock left unturned right?\n\n539\n00:30:16.477 --> 00:30:17.020\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n540\n00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.023\n&gt;&gt; So, this is\nManaging Groups Windows Server 101 and\n\n541\n00:30:20.023 --> 00:30:23.689\nthere's more to come, maybe a part two,\nmaybe even a part three.\n\n542\n00:30:23.689 --> 00:30:24.727\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Who knows.\n\n543\n00:30:24.727 --> 00:30:26.273\nHey Ronnie, great job,\nthank you so very much.\n\n544\n00:30:26.273 --> 00:30:26.923\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n545\n00:30:26.923 --> 00:30:28.784\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n546\n00:30:28.784 --> 00:30:31.222\nDid you know that a

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.313 --> 00:00:08.178\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.178 --> 00:00:12.560\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.840\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, and thank you for making\nthe intelligent choice to watch ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.290\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.714\nI'm your host, Zack Memos, as we\ncontinue on with Windows Server 101, and\n\n9\n00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:25.574\nthis is Managing Groups Part 2.\n\n10\n00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:27.580\nAnd who is bringing you\nthe information but Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.640\nRonnie, good to see you.\n\n12\n00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.710\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you too.\n\n13\n00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.760\nGlad to be here as we continue to take\na look at more of the managing groups.\n\n14\n00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.750\nNow, in the previous\nepisode we did talk about\n\n15\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.660\nthe idea of some of the options\nthat we have as we create groups.\n\n16\n00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.850\nAnd there's a lot of them, right?\n\n17\n00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.908\nWe've talked about the group types\nas well as different group scopes,\n\n18\n00:00:46.908 --> 00:00:49.424\nshowing you where they're actually used.\n\n19\n00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:52.588\nNow, if you're like, Ronnie,\nthat was way too much, well,\n\n20\n00:00:52.588 --> 00:00:55.640\nmake sure you go back into\nthe book itself and check it out.\n\n21\n00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.340\nAnd there's a very great explanation,\na little bit slower than what we've\n\n22\n00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.520\npresented there,\nthat will help you out too.\n\n23\n00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.410\nNow, don't think that with this,\nbecause this is a Server 101 show\n\n24\n00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.420\nthat we're doing, that we're going\ninto any real super depth on this.\n\n25\n00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.380\nIt can actually get way deeper and\na lot more complex,\n\n26\n00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.940\ndepending on what you're doing and\nhow this actually works.\n\n27\n00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.570\nBut we'll at least give you\nthe fundamentals as you start.\n\n28\n00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.910\nSo that is where we kind of left off, is\nthat we showed you those different types,\n\n29\n00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.160\nand the group scopes.\n\n30\n00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.100\nAnd now we're ready to\npick up in our Part 2.\n\n31\n00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.657\nThe great thing is that as we start,\nyou might be going, well, Ronnie,\n\n32\n00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:34.288\nyou mentioned the idea of global groups.\n\n33\n00:01:34.288 --> 00:01:38.237\nAnd usually thinking about them in terms\nof roles where you essentially group\n\n34\n00:01:38.237 --> 00:01:42.130\npeople together that have a similar\njob roles or duties together.\n\n35\n00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.320\nBut is there anything that helps us,\nokay, that we can actually see and\n\n36\n00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.920\nidentify and\nknow what we're talking about.\n\n37\n00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.270\nWell, the great thing is in\nActive Directory there really is, okay?\n\n38\n00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.986\nThere's what we call, of course,\ndefault groups or built-in groups that\n\n39\n00:01:56.986 --> 00:02:00.682\nwe can also end up seeing too and\nthat should help us out too.\n\n40\n00:02:00.682 --> 00:02:03.676\n&gt;&gt; And that's actually what I wanted\nto ask you, is what are some default\n\n41\n00:02:03.676 --> 00:02:06.443\ngroups or what are the default\ngroups that we need to be aware of?\n\n42\n00:02:06.443 --> 00:02:09.480\nAnd you're doing a great job,\nyou really are.\n\n43\n00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.462\nAnd what's great about being a part of\nITProTV is you can re-watch these videos.\n\n44\n00:02:14.462 --> 00:02:15.056\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's true.\n\n45\n00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:16.180\n&gt;&gt; You don't have to just watch them once.\n\n46\n00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.460\nSo anyway, go ahead, Ronnie.\n\n47\n00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.609\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now in terms of those\ndifferent groups, right,\n\n48\n00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.358\nyou actually ended up\nasking two questions.\n\n49\n00:02:21.358 --> 00:02:23.550\nNow, I don't know if Zack realized this or\nnot.\n\n50\n00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.500\nWe are gonna talk about some of the ones\nthat we have time to emphasize for\n\n51\n00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.940\nthis show, okay?\n\n52\n00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.040\nBut in terms of the groups as you want\nto become a better server administrator,\n\n53\n00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.780\nideally, and I mean it, ideally, you\nwould spend the time to get to know about\n\n54\n00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.700\nevery one of the default built-in\ngroups that are in Active Directory.\n\n55\n00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.860\nSo let me go ahead and\nshow you that list first,\n\n56\n00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.120\ncuz that's gonna intimidate\nyou a little bit.\n\n57\n00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.940\nBut then we're gonna actually just show\nyou the ones that we're gonna emphasize\n\n58\n00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.610\nright here instead.\n\n59\n00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.590\nSo let me take a look at my\ncomputer screen and we'll show you.\n\n60\n00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.897\nI'm not gonna create this group yet.\n\n61\n00:02:57.897 --> 00:03:01.330\nActually I can go ahead and just create\nit, and that way we'll put it in there.\n\n62\n00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.216\nAnd one of the things I didn't show\nat the end was actually creating one,\n\n63\n00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:05.603\nbecause we have that in this show.\n\n64\n00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:09.178\nBut you'll actually see a different\nicon also end up appearing,\n\n65\n00:03:09.178 --> 00:03:14.160\nwhere it actually looks like a couple of\npeople, right here, standing side by side.\n\n66\n00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.030\nWhereas you see individual\nusers right here, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.355\nNow, when it comes down to default groups,\nwell, underneath the Active Directory\n\n68\n00:03:22.355 --> 00:03:26.492\ndomain itself over here on my\nnavigation side of things, right?\n\n69\n00:03:26.492 --> 00:03:29.646\nWell, we don't see the term\ndefault anywhere, but\n\n70\n00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:32.220\nI do see where it says Builtin.\n\n71\n00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.210\nNow, when you click on\nthat Builtin container,\n\n72\n00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.500\nremember what I just said, Zach?\n\n73\n00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.535\nThat the groups, right,\nwhen you take a look at the icons,\n\n74\n00:03:40.535 --> 00:03:43.570\nyou'll end up noticing what a group is.\n\n75\n00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.500\nLook at that.\n\n76\n00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.331\nThese two people essentially\nstanding side by side.\n\n77\n00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:50.732\nAnd that's what you're\nactually seeing right there,\n\n78\n00:03:50.732 --> 00:03:52.631\nare those two people\nstanding side by side.\n\n79\n00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:55.593\nScroll down through here, and\nlet's see if I can scroll.\n\n80\n00:03:55.593 --> 00:03:57.800\nI have to kind of zoom out.\n\n81\n00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.169\nThat actually makes it\na little bit more impressive.\n\n82\n00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:05.322\nSo when I said about the idea here of\nyou should know about all of them?\n\n83\n00:04:05.322 --> 00:04:06.453\n&gt;&gt; You intimidated?\n[LAUGH]\n\n84\n00:04:06.453 --> 00:04:07.836\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now remember-\n\n85\n00:04:07.836 --> 00:04:08.474\n&gt;&gt; A little bit.\n\n86\n00:04:08.474 --> 00:04:10.706\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI'm not saying you have to memorize these.\n\n87\n00:04:10.706 --> 00:04:15.811\nAnd the great thing is even if you were\ngoing for like your MCSA and MCSE, right?\n\n88\n00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:19.079\nAnd later on as you watch through\nthose shows and you get prepared for\n\n89\n00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.010\nthat, you don't have to\nmemorize all of them.\n\n90\n00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.750\nBut if you were going to learn about them,\nright, this is a great place to begin.\n\n91\n00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.914\nAnd Brian himself, the one that actually\nwrites the book on the show that we're\n\n92\n00:04:31.914 --> 00:04:37.234\ndoing here, he says, look, a good server\nadministrator, right, is gonna take\n\n93\n00:04:37.234 --> 00:04:42.430\nthe time to really take a look and to kind\nof see [LAUGH] that there's a lot of them.\n\n94\n00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.800\nAnd that's why I said it's\ngonna be intimidating.\n\n95\n00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.300\nNow, I didn't mean that to be\nintimidating in that sense.\n\n96\n00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.390\nBut yes, over a period of time,\nas you get more and\n\n97\n00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.400\nmore experienced,\nyou're gonna want to take a look at these.\n\n98\n00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.820\nAnd you can learn about them.\n\n99\n00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.820\nBecause each one of them not only\ninclude the name that you actually see,\n\n100\n00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.680\nthe security type.\n\n101\n00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.420\nAnd you'll notice that the majorities,\nif not all of them, and\n\n102\n00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.610\nevery single one of them that I see right\nhere, they're all security groups, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.820\nSo we can actually see that group type.\n\n104\n00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.580\nAnd this is also a domain local group,\nactually.\n\n105\n00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.400\nSo it actually gives you\nthe group scope as well.\n\n106\n00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.020\nSo the type is what?\n\n107\n00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.450\nIs the security, okay, but\nnotice the scope here is a Domain Local.\n\n108\n00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.190\nAnd then you also have this nice\ndescription that you also see\n\n109\n00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.378\nover here too.\n\n110\n00:05:30.378 --> 00:05:33.320\nSo we wanna spend a little bit\nof time on probably the more\n\n111\n00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.210\ncommon ones that you'll end up seeing.\n\n112\n00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.080\nBut you will see these throughout, okay?\n\n113\n00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.300\nAs you start working with Active\nDirectory, you'll start seeing more and\n\n114\n00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.040\nmore of these, okay?\n\n115\n00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.830\nSo don't fret.\n\n116\n00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.240\nDon't spend time sweating and\nworrying about this.\n\n117\n00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.500\nOver time you're gonna learn about\nmore of these than you realize.\n\n118\n00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.730\nJust take the time to note what\nthey actually are here, okay?\n\n119\n00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.850\nSo let's start off with kind of the most\ncommon one when you first start here,\n\n120\n00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.990\nwhich is the Administrators group.\n\n121\n00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.520\nAnd when you take a look at this,\nright, let me zoom in so\n\n122\n00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.350\nwe can see a little bit better,\nnotice that it has, well, everything.\n\n123\n00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.280\nAnd what we want to do is understand\nwhat this Administrator group is.\n\n124\n00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.460\nWe already talked of course about the\nscope as well as the security type of it.\n\n125\n00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.830\nBut notice right here under\nthe description itself, where it says,\n\n126\n00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.890\nadministrators have complete and\nunrestricted access.\n\n127\n00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.589\nAnd let me see if I can zoom in so\nthat we can see that a little bit better.\n\n128\n00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.080\nTo, well, what is it actually\nto when we start to take a look?\n\n129\n00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.640\nTo the computer/domain.\n\n130\n00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.240\nSo this particular group, being a domain\nlocal group in terms of the scope as well\n\n131\n00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.680\nas security group, means we can go ahead\nand have complete and unrestricted access.\n\n132\n00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.280\nBut it also means that this can\nbe assigned to a resource and\n\n133\n00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.090\nbe able to access whatever it needs.\n\n134\n00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.410\nIf I wanna see who's\na member of this group,\n\n135\n00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.687\nall I have to do is click\non the Members tab.\n\n136\n00:06:52.687 --> 00:06:57.635\nAnd this will show me everybody that's\nalso a member of this Administrators\n\n137\n00:06:57.635 --> 00:06:59.020\ngroup as well.\n\n138\n00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.890\nAnd you see some other ones right here,\nDomain Admins and Enterprise Admins too.\n\n139\n00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.750\nNow, if the group that you're taking\na look at might also be a member of\n\n140\n00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.790\nanother group,\nwe can also click on the Member Of tab.\n\n141\n00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.910\nAnd you'll notice something here, that\nbecause the Administrators is a built-in\n\n142\n00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:21.490\ngroup here, it says, builtin groups\ncannot be added to other groups, as well.\n\n143\n00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.880\nSo that's part of the default.\n\n144\n00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.680\nThe Windows install itself essentially\ncreates these built-in groups for us.\n\n145\n00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.880\nAnd we can add them to, well,\nsome groups, right, such as this.\n\n146\n00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.940\nBut it can't be a member of another one,\nokay?\n\n147\n00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.366\nNow, one of the other groups, when we\nstart talking about the idea of built-in,\n\n148\n00:07:40.366 --> 00:07:45.007\nthose are special types of groups\nthat the Windows operating system,\n\n149\n00:07:45.007 --> 00:07:49.648\nthat's what I should say,\nthe operating system itself builds into,\n\n150\n00:07:49.648 --> 00:07:52.188\nwell, the entire operating system.\n\n151\n00:07:52.188 --> 00:07:55.197\nBut the other groups,\nbecause we called them default groups,\n\n152\n00:07:55.197 --> 00:07:58.396\nit means that they're actually\ncreated somewhere else at a time.\n\n153\n00:07:58.396 --> 00:08:03.401\nSo before this computer or\nactually this is the O365-DC01, so\n\n154\n00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:09.150\nremember that we're actually connected\nto that computer right there.\n\n155\n00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:14.256\nBefore this computer became part of the\nActive Directory domain that we created,\n\n156\n00:08:14.256 --> 00:08:18.032\nthose were essentially the groups\nthat existed right here.\n\n157\n00:08:18.032 --> 00:08:22.037\nWe didn't have any other built in groups,\nthose were the ones that existed.\n\n158\n00:08:22.037 --> 00:08:26.500\nBut when this computer became\nthe domain controller.\n\n159\n00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.992\nSo this Office 365 DC1 when it\nbecame part of that domain and\n\n160\n00:08:30.992 --> 00:08:35.844\ndomain controller, it created\nadditional default groups for us.\n\n161\n00:08:35.844 --> 00:08:40.060\nNot built in groups, but default groups.\n\n162\n00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.263\nSo notice, let me go back here into\nthe built in and administers again.\n\n163\n00:08:44.263 --> 00:08:49.130\nRemember Zack, I said that we wanna take a\nlook at some of the other groups in here.\n\n164\n00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.953\nSo like Domain Admins and\nEnterprise Admins.\n\n165\n00:08:51.953 --> 00:08:55.420\nI easily mistake that and\nforget a lot of times.\n\n166\n00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.471\nThat even though these are here,\n\n167\n00:08:57.471 --> 00:09:01.584\nI think they're built in group\nbecause they are added right here.\n\n168\n00:09:01.584 --> 00:09:05.780\nBut they're not they're part of the\ndefault group, that we're talking about\n\n169\n00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:10.770\nhere, and notice that they are not inside\nof where inside of the built in container.\n\n170\n00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.622\nSo what do you think\nhappened to them Zack?\n\n171\n00:09:12.622 --> 00:09:14.090\n&gt;&gt; Well that's the question.\n\n172\n00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.620\nIf they're not there then\nare they somewhere else?\n\n173\n00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.280\nCan we locate them and can we access it.\n\n174\n00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.543\n&gt;&gt; Yeah when you start thinking about it\nit begins to get a little bit scary at\n\n175\n00:09:21.543 --> 00:09:25.074\ntimes, so it's very easy to make a mistake\nand say, all right domain admins,\n\n176\n00:09:25.074 --> 00:09:27.017\nenterprise admins are in built in groups.\n\n177\n00:09:27.017 --> 00:09:31.060\nAnd then you look at the list and\ngo wait a minute, they're not there.\n\n178\n00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.590\nSo it becomes a little bit more unusual.\n\n179\n00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.943\nWell what happens right is that once we've\ncreated the domain that's the only time we\n\n180\n00:09:37.943 --> 00:09:42.243\nreally need an enterprise admin that's the\nonly time we really need a domain admin.\n\n181\n00:09:42.243 --> 00:09:45.870\nSo that means that they were\nadded in after the fact okay when\n\n182\n00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.753\nthe Active Directory users and computers\nhere was essentially created for us.\n\n183\n00:09:50.753 --> 00:09:55.888\nSo if I scroll down the bottom,\nI'll navigate down the bottom here I can\n\n184\n00:09:55.888 --> 00:10:01.610\nnow select users and in the users,\nyou'll notice that there are a few.\n\n185\n00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:02.989\nAnd you can see some of the ones that I,\n\n186\n00:10:02.989 --> 00:10:04.727\ncan you guess which ones I created here,\nZack?\n\n187\n00:10:04.727 --> 00:10:06.513\n&gt;&gt; Well, Batman.\n\n188\n00:10:06.513 --> 00:10:10.572\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, do you see Batman and look,\n\n189\n00:10:10.572 --> 00:10:14.950\nClark yeah that's probably\nClark Kent I'm assuming, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:20.310\nBut now as I scroll on through here,\nlook at that: Domain Admins.\n\n191\n00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:21.110\nAnd it's a group.\n\n192\n00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.340\nRemember the little icon that\nI showed you right here, too.\n\n193\n00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.440\nSo this is a group.\n\n194\n00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.050\nLet me zoom out a little bit more and\n\n195\n00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:31.870\nlet's take a look at the way\nthe Active Directory created this one.\n\n196\n00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:36.500\nNotice that for the domain admins,\nhere is the group type, right?\n\n197\n00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.140\nThe security group type, okay?\n\n198\n00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.887\nExcuse me not the security group,\nthe global group.\n\n199\n00:10:42.887 --> 00:10:44.880\nThe security group itself is fine.\n\n200\n00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.090\nSo we do have the actual scope and\ntype of the group listed for us.\n\n201\n00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:55.640\nSo domain admins themselves\nreally do give us that idea.\n\n202\n00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.499\nIs that a domain admin is\nactually that global group.\n\n203\n00:10:58.499 --> 00:11:01.406\nThat we have, and\nthe scope of it is global, and\n\n204\n00:11:01.406 --> 00:11:04.110\nit is security group type as well.\n\n205\n00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:08.094\nNow the other thing, of course,\nis that along with this, right,\n\n206\n00:11:08.094 --> 00:11:12.810\nlocal admins normally have the right to\ndo a domain join for all the computers.\n\n207\n00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:17.131\nAnd if I double click on\nthat domain admins group and\n\n208\n00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:24.710\nthen I select Members here, notice that\nit actually added in, Administrator.\n\n209\n00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.936\nNow we just the administrators group, but\n\n210\n00:11:27.936 --> 00:11:31.789\nadministrator is actually\nlocal administrator,\n\n211\n00:11:31.789 --> 00:11:37.893\nthe one that is actually built in, as a\nbuilt in user, into the computer as well.\n\n212\n00:11:37.893 --> 00:11:43.131\nSo normally, every local administrator\nis also going to be part of that domain,\n\n213\n00:11:43.131 --> 00:11:47.690\nat least for this machine, I should say,\nfor the domain controller.\n\n214\n00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.203\nIt's gonna be part of\nthe domain admin group.\n\n215\n00:11:49.203 --> 00:11:51.540\nSo I should say every single local.\n\n216\n00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.070\nBut the domain controller\nis gonna be part of.\n\n217\n00:11:55.070 --> 00:12:01.570\nAnd here, I apparently assigned Cherokee\nas a domain admin to this group as well.\n\n218\n00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.303\nSo granting membership though\nto this particular group,\n\n219\n00:12:05.303 --> 00:12:10.730\nshould really only be if the person\nreally needs domain admin privileges.\n\n220\n00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.976\nWe do not want everybody to\nhave domain admin privileges.\n\n221\n00:12:12.976 --> 00:12:16.512\nIt used to be the default way\nthat user accounts were created,\n\n222\n00:12:16.512 --> 00:12:19.786\nthey were automatically\nassigned into this group here.\n\n223\n00:12:19.786 --> 00:12:21.090\nNot a good idea.\n\n224\n00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.580\nThey changed that in 2000,\nbut overall though,\n\n225\n00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.940\nit's just one of those things where it's\nlike you shouldn't have complete and\n\n226\n00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.220\nutter control over your domain just\nbecause you're a member of the domain.\n\n227\n00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:30.945\nThat's what we had.\n\n228\n00:12:30.945 --> 00:12:34.360\n&gt;&gt; And that actually goes back\nto another company I worked for.\n\n229\n00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.200\nIf I needed to download\na program I couldn't do it\n\n230\n00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.990\nunless an admin was assigned and\nhe came in and did it for me.\n\n231\n00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and all that is due to\nthe idea of security right,\n\n232\n00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.050\nthe principle of least privilege.\n\n233\n00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:50.040\nYou need to use the program but in terms\nof you just being able to install programs\n\n234\n00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.250\nas you choose to,\nthat organization probably said,\n\n235\n00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:57.150\nnot everybody should install\nprograms on to the computers we own.\n\n236\n00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.950\nJust because they want to install them.\n\n237\n00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.974\n&gt;&gt; I agree.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it does work out that way,\n\n238\n00:13:00.974 --> 00:13:03.016\nand it's a better security practice and\n\n239\n00:13:03.016 --> 00:13:05.760\nsomething that we should\nend up following too.\n\n240\n00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.957\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, what is this,\nam I saying this right, schema admin?\n\n241\n00:13:07.957 --> 00:13:08.576\n&gt;&gt; Yap.\n\n242\n00:13:08.576 --> 00:13:09.151\n&gt;&gt; What is that?\n\n243\n00:13:09.151 --> 00:13:11.510\n&gt;&gt; Schema admin is another one.\n\n244\n00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.010\nNow, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that one too.\n\n245\n00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:18.137\nNow this again is part of the domain and\nlet me see how much I can scroll in here.\n\n246\n00:13:18.137 --> 00:13:21.900\nNow you'll notice that this one change let\nme see if I can get that press my head.\n\n247\n00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.601\nThis one is a security group type but\n\n248\n00:13:24.601 --> 00:13:28.484\nnoticed the scope is\nuniversal at this point okay?\n\n249\n00:13:28.484 --> 00:13:33.762\nNow this is a very special unusual\ntype of default group that we have,\n\n250\n00:13:33.762 --> 00:13:38.494\nand is not meant for somebody to\njust be a member of that group.\n\n251\n00:13:38.494 --> 00:13:42.342\nNormally the only reason why you're\nactually using this is that you have to\n\n252\n00:13:42.342 --> 00:13:45.720\nextend what we call the schema\nof the active directory.\n\n253\n00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.070\nAnd that means expanding\nto able to hold more stuff.\n\n254\n00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:52.480\nSo even though active directory is\na structure and a database that holds so\n\n255\n00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.090\nmuch stuff.\n\n256\n00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:58.430\nIf you're adding in, let's say,\nan Exchange server for your email, okay?\n\n257\n00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:01.480\nYou may have to extend\nthe schema to make that work, so\n\n258\n00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.420\nit actually integrates\ninto Active Directory.\n\n259\n00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.109\nSo usually, the best practice here is,\nif you're actually gonna use that,\n\n260\n00:14:08.109 --> 00:14:12.160\njust use it as a temporary basis, where we\nassign somebody the schema admin rights.\n\n261\n00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.330\nAnd then after their particular duties\nare done, we take them out of that.\n\n262\n00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.130\nWe don't want somebody's account just\nfloating out there that just does this\n\n263\n00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.177\nall the time, okay.\n\n264\n00:14:21.177 --> 00:14:22.966\nSo, this is actually a good one but\n\n265\n00:14:22.966 --> 00:14:26.010\nmost of us are probably never\ngonna really need to do this.\n\n266\n00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:30.440\nThe other one that we also wanna\nlook at is the Enterprise Admin.\n\n267\n00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:35.220\nAnd notice this one too is also\nThe Security Group is actually\n\n268\n00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.820\na universal scope as well, sorry.\n\n269\n00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.010\nI'm going to forget-\n&gt;&gt; Type in scope.\n\n270\n00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:43.670\n&gt;&gt; Type in scope, yep,\ntype in scope is what we have.\n\n271\n00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:47.050\nAnd that is because they actually\nneed to do things that are beyond\n\n272\n00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:51.360\nthe limitation of a single domain,\na lot of times.\n\n273\n00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.680\nSo the enterprise admin has\naccess to every domain.\n\n274\n00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.070\nSo just like you saw in my forest\nwhen I had those three domains\n\n275\n00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:01.340\nthis enterprise admin has the ability\nto say look, I need to actually go and\n\n276\n00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.230\nchange some stuff over here.\n\n277\n00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.790\nI need to be able to do this.\n\n278\n00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:10.622\nOnce again, not something that you want to\nleave at someone's user account just so\n\n279\n00:15:10.622 --> 00:15:12.636\nthat they log into it daily.\n\n280\n00:15:12.636 --> 00:15:16.312\nThis is something else that if you're\nactually gonna do this temporary\n\n281\n00:15:16.312 --> 00:15:19.020\nadministrative task across domains,\nyes, okay?\n\n282\n00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.380\nAnd then, remove them from that group,\nadd it in when you need to,\n\n283\n00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.080\nremove it when you don't need to.\n\n284\n00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.660\nThe less privileges that\nyou give to everybody, and\n\n285\n00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:31.310\nthat they don't remain permanent,\nyou assign them on an as need basis,\n\n286\n00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.078\nis better in terms of the management,\nespecially of these groups here.\n\n287\n00:15:35.078 --> 00:15:38.200\nWe don't wanna just create groups for\nthe sake of creating groups, okay.\n\n288\n00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.860\nWe want the groups to be effective and\nthe use in what they actually have.\n\n289\n00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.380\nBut if they're only really meant for\ntemporary duty,\n\n290\n00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.119\nmake sure you actually make them\nnot the group temporary but\n\n291\n00:15:47.119 --> 00:15:49.449\nremove the people that\ndon't need to be in there.\n\n292\n00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:52.712\nPut the people in that need to,\nwhen they don't need them anymore,\n\n293\n00:15:52.712 --> 00:15:56.031\ntake them out of it as well Those\nare kinds of the big ones that you end up\n\n294\n00:15:56.031 --> 00:15:59.752\nseeing the majority of times we start\ntalking out some of the default groups So\n\n295\n00:15:59.752 --> 00:16:02.694\nremember, you'll see them in\na couple locations, right?\n\n296\n00:16:02.694 --> 00:16:03.882\nThe built-in container,\n\n297\n00:16:03.882 --> 00:16:07.030\nwe only really took a look at\nthe administrative group there.\n\n298\n00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.770\nBut the rest of them, the domain admin,\nthe enterprise admin, and\n\n299\n00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.100\nthe schema admin?\n\n300\n00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.930\nThose came underneath Users,\nwhich'll only happen when you have\n\n301\n00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:16.940\nthe Active Directory domain, and\nthat should make sense for us.\n\n302\n00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:21.225\n&gt;&gt; So very obvious question,\nhow do you add members to a group?\n\n303\n00:16:21.225 --> 00:16:24.663\n&gt;&gt; Yep, actually that is a good\nquestion here so let's go ahead and\n\n304\n00:16:24.663 --> 00:16:25.970\nsee how we can do that.\n\n305\n00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:29.335\nNow if we wanna add them in to let's say\na default group here, let's go ahead and\n\n306\n00:16:29.335 --> 00:16:30.430\ndo this here.\n\n307\n00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:35.359\nSo right here I'm going to choose\nlet's do the domain admin.\n\n308\n00:16:35.359 --> 00:16:39.110\nOr actually let's do enterprise admins,\nthat'll work.\n\n309\n00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.850\nSo under the enterprise admins,\nif I select and\n\n310\n00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.160\nI double click on him using\nthe Active Directory, users and computers,\n\n311\n00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:52.380\nI can click on members and now notice that\nyou've already got a few people in here.\n\n312\n00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.750\nNow for those of you looking at this and\nsaying,\n\n313\n00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.400\nman Ronnie really has\na fascination with boy bands.\n\n314\n00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.945\nNot necessarily, this is essentially-\n&gt;&gt; That Lance Bass,\n\n315\n00:16:58.945 --> 00:16:59.805\nhe just keeps popping up.\n\n316\n00:16:59.805 --> 00:17:02.706\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, Lance and\nJoey and Justin Timberlake here,\n\n317\n00:17:02.706 --> 00:17:06.140\nthat's because we're actually using\nthis for another show as well.\n\n318\n00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:10.357\nBut overall though, you start to see this,\nthat it's fairly easy here.\n\n319\n00:17:10.357 --> 00:17:13.408\nAnd the easiest way, simply click Add, and\n\n320\n00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:17.874\nnow as long as you know what\nthe user account's name is gonna be.\n\n321\n00:17:17.874 --> 00:17:19.332\nSo we saw Batman a little bit earlier?\n\n322\n00:17:19.332 --> 00:17:20.490\n&gt;&gt; Batman was one of them, yeah.\n\n323\n00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.523\n&gt;&gt; So let's say Batman.\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n324\n00:17:22.523 --> 00:17:23.270\n&gt;&gt; And we did see Clark.\n\n325\n00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.470\nSo let's see, look!\n\n326\n00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:29.520\nIt underlines, which means they found him\ninside of my active directory network.\n\n327\n00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.200\nAnd there we go, now there it is.\n\n328\n00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.810\nSo it's not a complicated thing\nto add somebody into a group.\n\n329\n00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.020\nAnd the neat thing is\nremoval is just as easy.\n\n330\n00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.870\nWe simply click on the remove button,\nand they are gone.\n\n331\n00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:42.599\nNow this is not.\n\n332\n00:17:42.599 --> 00:17:45.361\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah this is fairly easy as long as you\n\n333\n00:17:45.361 --> 00:17:47.611\nactually know what their usernames are.\n\n334\n00:17:47.611 --> 00:17:49.170\nIt makes a little bit of sense here.\n\n335\n00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.300\n&gt;&gt; Remember, I'm Batman.\n\n336\n00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.820\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and you forgot your cape.\n\n337\n00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.900\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n&gt;&gt; Today so something else is going on.\n\n338\n00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.410\nAll right so now the other thing that\nwe also wanna do is take a look as from\n\n339\n00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:02.880\nthe Active Directory Adminstration Center.\n\n340\n00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.721\nAnd the reason why is that more and more\npeople are starting to migrate towards\n\n341\n00:18:07.721 --> 00:18:11.611\nusing the Active Directory\nAdministrative Center here too.\n\n342\n00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:13.620\nAnd let me get logged in here.\n\n343\n00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.624\nIf I can, again,\nremembering this long password.\n\n344\n00:18:17.624 --> 00:18:19.327\n&gt;&gt; Well it's like walking chewing gum.\n\n345\n00:18:19.327 --> 00:18:20.452\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That sort of thing.\n\n346\n00:18:20.452 --> 00:18:21.361\n&gt;&gt; And I can't do it.\n\n347\n00:18:26.576 --> 00:18:28.745\nThere it goes, whew,\nthat only took me three or\n\n348\n00:18:28.745 --> 00:18:32.390\nfour times of typing in the password and\nwe're ready to go.\n\n349\n00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.780\nThis is just another way to be able\nto manage active directory a little\n\n350\n00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:39.950\nbit easier and a little bit better at\nleast that's what they claim right.\n\n351\n00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:44.430\nSo once I have the administrative center\nup over on the left hand side I'm\n\n352\n00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.580\ngoing to make sure that I find\nmy domain by clicking on it and\n\n353\n00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:52.390\nthen from this point I can choose\nanother group if I want to as well.\n\n354\n00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:58.718\nSo here if I wanna go into users, I can go\ndown to the, what was it, scheme admins?\n\n355\n00:18:58.718 --> 00:19:01.185\n&gt;&gt; Scheme admins.\n&gt;&gt; Let me see if I can find scheme admins.\n\n356\n00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.740\nAnd if that ever comes through,\nthere we go okay.\n\n357\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.250\nScheme admins inside the active\ndirectory administrative center,\n\n358\n00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.760\nnotice that it gives you\na lot more options, right?\n\n359\n00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.430\nSo you have much more granular control.\n\n360\n00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:23.960\nIf I want to add a member I can just\nclick on members, right here and\n\n361\n00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:30.109\nonce I click on members I can click on\nthe add button and here we can add in.\n\n362\n00:19:30.109 --> 00:19:31.161\n&gt;&gt; Batman.\n&gt;&gt; Clark.\n\n363\n00:19:31.161 --> 00:19:34.680\n[LAUGH] And click OK.\n\n364\n00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.480\nAnd so now that's fairly easy,\n\n365\n00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.500\nokay so notice again you also\nhave this remove button.\n\n366\n00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.042\nEasy enough.\n\n367\n00:19:41.042 --> 00:19:43.700\n&gt;&gt; Easy.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so not very difficult the key\n\n368\n00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.230\nhere is just to remember that being\nable to do this is the key so\n\n369\n00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:52.760\nyou have two utilities here in terms\nof being able to add this in and\n\n370\n00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.100\ndoing what we need to\nto get everything done.\n\n371\n00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.810\nOkay, now when we stop with that, right.\n\n372\n00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:05.260\nSo I'm gonna close that out again, and\neven on the, everything that we see here,\n\n373\n00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.080\nwe also need to think about\nthe use of PowerShell.\n\n374\n00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:13.280\nNow this one, it doesn't seem logical for\nus to use PowerShell to do this.\n\n375\n00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.120\nNow can we do it?\n\n376\n00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.167\nYes, okay.\n\n377\n00:20:15.167 --> 00:20:16.490\nCan you do it for an individual user?\n\n378\n00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:17.540\nYes you can.\n\n379\n00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.380\nBut the goal behind PowerShell is for\n\n380\n00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.700\nthe idea of being able to create\ngroups of things that we want to.\n\n381\n00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.940\nSo let me go ahead and\nshow you what I've done here for a moment.\n\n382\n00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.298\nAnd it's right here.\n\n383\n00:20:30.298 --> 00:20:31.090\nLet me see.\n\n384\n00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:38.100\nI created a txt file of well, different\npeople that I want to add into a group.\n\n385\n00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:43.740\nSo here it is, these are the user names\nthat I've actually chosen to add in here,\n\n386\n00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:48.750\nso I've been picking from fictional\ncharacters here is what I did.\n\n387\n00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.749\nNow all of these already exist inside\nmy Active Directory structure and\n\n388\n00:20:52.749 --> 00:20:55.091\nI want to add them all\ninto a single group.\n\n389\n00:20:55.091 --> 00:20:59.080\nWell two ways that I just showed\nyou have to one at a time okay.\n\n390\n00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.970\nThat's a little bit inefficient when you\nget a list of 50 people that need to added\n\n391\n00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.765\ninto multiple groups becomes\na little bit more difficult.\n\n392\n00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.020\n&gt;&gt; So go back to PowerShell.\n\n393\n00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:11.226\n&gt;&gt; All right so using powershell right I\njust need to be able to run this okay, so\n\n394\n00:21:11.226 --> 00:21:14.774\nnow that I have that list I wanna\ntie this in a little bit earlier so\n\n395\n00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:19.600\nthat we won't have to watch me type,\nwhich is normally a terrible thing here.\n\n396\n00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.710\nWhere it's actually getting the content,\nand then listing the file out.\n\n397\n00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:27.310\nDoing that for\neach object to add in this member here.\n\n398\n00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:31.010\nAnd then the identity is\nthis PR group that we have.\n\n399\n00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.520\nSo that means that inside of my\nActive Directory I already have to\n\n400\n00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:38.630\nhave a group called PR, which I did\ncreate off camera earlier here.\n\n401\n00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.204\nSo then it's actually adding\nin those members from what,\n\n402\n00:21:41.204 --> 00:21:43.590\nthe file that it actually pulled it from.\n\n403\n00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.730\nSo if everything else is right,\nI shouldn't get, I should be fine, and\n\n404\n00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:48.590\nthere we go.\n\n405\n00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.950\nSo now everything is done,\nnow the idea is to check this out, and\n\n406\n00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.860\nsee if it actually did create it\nwhere we thought it should go.\n\n407\n00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:59.240\nSo inside of Active Directory\nuse computers.\n\n408\n00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.450\nRight here underneath publicity.\n\n409\n00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:07.420\nSo Office 365 publicity add created\nthis container called PR right here.\n\n410\n00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:13.630\nJust that same thing, the actual security\ntype and then the global scope here.\n\n411\n00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:17.140\nI double click on it,\nhere is the moment of truth, Zach.\n\n412\n00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.090\nDo you think they're gonna\nbe here under numbers?\n\n413\n00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.240\n&gt;&gt; I believe it will happen.\n\n414\n00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.750\n&gt;&gt; There you go, okay?\n\n415\n00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:26.876\nSo now we have that list and\nit did create them all from Batman all\n\n416\n00:22:26.876 --> 00:22:31.921\nthe way through ObiWan,\nthey are all added in the users here.\n\n417\n00:22:31.921 --> 00:22:33.500\n&gt;&gt; And they shall pass.\n\n418\n00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's fairly simple, right?\n\n419\n00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.597\nTo be able to do something\nlike this as well.\n\n420\n00:22:37.597 --> 00:22:39.949\nThe great thing is if you\nwanted to remove these members,\n\n421\n00:22:39.949 --> 00:22:43.210\nit's pretty much just about the same\nthing that we would have here.\n\n422\n00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:44.730\nBut instead you dash,\n\n423\n00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:49.220\nyou use a remove AD group member instead\nand be able to do the same thing.\n\n424\n00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.110\nSo we're not going to worry about\nthat too much at this point\n\n425\n00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.580\nusing the PowerShell but\nyes, it can be done.\n\n426\n00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:58.680\nMake sure you look inside the book\nto help you out on the removal part.\n\n427\n00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.937\nBut overall though this should at least\nget you a good solid understanding in\n\n428\n00:23:02.937 --> 00:23:07.394\nthese couple of episodes that we've done\non taking a look at managing groups and\n\n429\n00:23:07.394 --> 00:23:09.477\nthat should be a great start for you.\n\n430\n00:23:09.477 --> 00:23:13.032\nDon't forget there's a lot more to cover\nand if you want to learn more about it\n\n431\n00:23:13.032 --> 00:23:16.760\nmake sure you check the MCSA shows and\nMCSE shows right here on IT Pro TV.\n\n432\n00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:21.576\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie once again an amazing job and\nthis is Windows server 101 managing groups\n\n433\n00:23:21.576 --> 00:23:25.146\npart two, you want to watch part\none if you have not already.\n\n434\n00:23:25.146 --> 00:23:27.364\nAnd there is so much more in this series,\n\n435\n00:23:27.364 --> 00:23:30.314\nWindows server 101 brought\nto you by Ronnie Wong.\n\n436\n00:23:30.314 --> 00:23:32.325\nRound of applause for Ronnie right there.\n\n437\n00:23:32.325

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:08.390\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.127\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:14.664\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:17.090\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.890\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue with Windows Server 101\n\n8\n00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.220\nwith the man who knows all about it,\nRonnie Wong, right over there.\n\n9\n00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.804\nHey, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:24.804 --> 00:00:25.579\n&gt;&gt; How are you doing, Zach?\n\n11\n00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.770\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, and we're going to\nbe talking about group policy, right?\n\n12\n00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:30.440\n&gt;&gt; That is correct.\n\n13\n00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.220\n&gt;&gt; So first, can you give us just\nlike a breakdown of the fundamental.\n\n14\n00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.823\nWhat is group policy?\n\n15\n00:00:34.823 --> 00:00:38.374\n&gt;&gt; When it comes down to taking\na look at this idea of group policy,\n\n16\n00:00:38.374 --> 00:00:40.585\nthis is kind of a little bit stranger for\n\n17\n00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:44.070\nmost of us that have been working\nin the field for a little bit.\n\n18\n00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.281\nBut now we're moving\ninto the server realm and\n\n19\n00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:49.523\nunderstanding group policy become\na little bit more challenging.\n\n20\n00:00:49.523 --> 00:00:53.953\nAnd that's because of the scope of\nthings that actually end up changing.\n\n21\n00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:55.699\nOn a regular desktop computer,\n\n22\n00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.544\nyou have the ability to set\ncertain things in place,\n\n23\n00:00:58.544 --> 00:01:02.960\nsuch as configuration settings, where\nyou don't have to worry about too much.\n\n24\n00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.560\nYou set them and, essentially,\nyou lock them down.\n\n25\n00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.760\nSomebody else logs in the computer,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n26\n00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.423\nYou've chosen the settings that you want.\n\n27\n00:01:09.423 --> 00:01:12.040\nAnd they have to follow whatever\nconfiguration that you want.\n\n28\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.942\nSo it's essentially a configuration\nmanagement that we're ending up talking\n\n29\n00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:17.380\nabout as we begin.\n\n30\n00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.320\nThe problem with group policy is simple.\n\n31\n00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.690\nAs simple as that is for local computers,\n\n32\n00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.040\nseems like it,\nthere is a ton of stuff in there.\n\n33\n00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.280\nAnd group policy, itself,\nin the domain realm and the scope of it,\n\n34\n00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.500\nit is so\ncomplex of a topic that entire books and\n\n35\n00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.580\neven multiple-part books\nare written about group policy.\n\n36\n00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.910\nSo the nature of it is unusual, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.640\nCreating a group policy in that\nsetting is not difficult to do.\n\n38\n00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.227\nConfiguring it, though,\nis a complex topic.\n\n39\n00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:52.390\nAnd we'll show you what\nwe're talking about there.\n\n40\n00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.685\nAnd making sure it works\nin the way they want to,\n\n41\n00:01:54.685 --> 00:01:59.030\nverifing that everything's working,\nit actually is a much more complex topic\n\n42\n00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.740\nthan we're gonna have time\nto dive completely into.\n\n43\n00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.980\n&gt;&gt; So you're gonna do this for\nus in ten minutes, right?\n\n44\n00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.500\n&gt;&gt; We are going to try and\n\n45\n00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.080\nintroduce you at least to a sliver,\na beginning of the nature of what we had.\n\n46\n00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.420\nNow the great thing is if you've been\nfollowing along in the series so far,\n\n47\n00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.500\nWe've spent several chapters, right, in\ntaking a look at Active Directory, itself.\n\n48\n00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.040\nAnd the reason why I wanna do that is\nthat that prepares us on a basis for\n\n49\n00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.620\nsome of the things that we're about to do.\n\n50\n00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.600\nLearning how to actually have users and\ncomputers, creating groups.\n\n51\n00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.120\nWell, you need all of those if\nyou're gonna be using group policy.\n\n52\n00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.720\nThe reason why is group policy generally\napplies to, users, and computers, and\n\n53\n00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.780\ngroups, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.230\nSo if you don't have those in place,\nwell, then it doesn't really make sense.\n\n55\n00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.055\nBut now that we've gone through that, in\nwhatever lab environment you've built up\n\n56\n00:02:45.055 --> 00:02:48.880\nif you've been following it from beginning\nto end, this particularly setting for\n\n57\n00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.410\nyou, should now be prepared.\n\n58\n00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.650\nIn other words, your network should\nbe prepared to at least create some\n\n59\n00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.600\nvery minimal types of policies\nlike what we're gonna be doing.\n\n60\n00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.935\nNow do not take for\ngranted then that even after a couple of,\n\n61\n00:03:00.935 --> 00:03:04.480\nmaybe three or four episodes that\nwe spend in group policy here.\n\n62\n00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.630\nDon't think that that means\nyou've mastered group policy.\n\n63\n00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.190\nAnd I mean it, there is so\n\n64\n00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.580\nmuch depth to it that we really\naren't gonna have the time to cover.\n\n65\n00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.900\nBut we want you to at least\nget some basic skills in\n\n66\n00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.324\nunderstanding how to navigate around it.\n\n67\n00:03:17.324 --> 00:03:19.820\nAnd understanding some of\nthe complexities behind it and\n\n68\n00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.030\ndifferentiations that we have to\nbe able to make, as well, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.240\nSo that's what we wanna be able to do.\n\n70\n00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.310\nSo let's start off with\nan example as what we want to\n\n71\n00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.690\nunderstand in terms of group policy and\nthe idea of managing configurations.\n\n72\n00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.010\nSo let's say that what we've decided to\ndo inside of our organization is that\n\n73\n00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.340\nafter a period of time,\nwe've realized something.\n\n74\n00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.670\nThat people are constantly walking\naway from their desktop computers.\n\n75\n00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.340\nAnd they're leaving themselves logged in.\n\n76\n00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.150\nWhether they're going\nto get a cup of coffee.\n\n77\n00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.610\nOr whether they're going to\nanother side of the room.\n\n78\n00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.020\nOr to another office just to shoot\nthe breeze for a little bit of time.\n\n79\n00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.360\nThey're working, and they're leaving\ntheir computers pretty much as is.\n\n80\n00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.330\nNow that, in itself, is a security risk.\n\n81\n00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.690\nMost of us don't think about it\ncuz we're saying, I trust Zach.\n\n82\n00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.660\nHe's not gonna do anything to my computer.\n\n83\n00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.155\nWell, even though we may trust Zach,\n\n84\n00:04:11.155 --> 00:04:15.290\nyou can't do that on a regular basis for\nyour company.\n\n85\n00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.320\nWe need to set up something that says,\nlook, here it is.\n\n86\n00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.390\nWhat we want to do is we wanna make\nsure that our computer gets locked.\n\n87\n00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.499\nWell, the easiest,\nI shouldn't say easiest,\n\n88\n00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:26.105\none of the things that you\ncan do is fairly simple.\n\n89\n00:04:26.105 --> 00:04:30.260\nYou simply send out an email, or you give\neverybody a notice in the office and\n\n90\n00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.270\nsay, before you stand\nup from you computer,\n\n91\n00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.160\nmake sure you lock your computer screen,\nokay?\n\n92\n00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.500\nEasy enough, and, of course,\npeople start following.\n\n93\n00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.700\nAfter a while, they stop following.\n\n94\n00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.320\nAfter a while, somebody goes,\nI forgot that time.\n\n95\n00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.680\nAnd after a while,\neverybody in the office forgets it, okay?\n\n96\n00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.480\nSo using something like group policy,\nthough, will allow us then, if we will\n\n97\n00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.720\ntake the time, to be able instead to go,\nI want to enforce that policy.\n\n98\n00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.160\nBecause if it's an active directory-joined\ndomain, we can literally set the policy.\n\n99\n00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.650\nAnd then it will do it for them,\nit will literally go ahead and\n\n100\n00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.940\nsay, hey, this is gonna apply.\n\n101\n00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.180\nSo after, let's say five minutes\nof time that there's inactivity,\n\n102\n00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.830\nwe're gonna send it to a screen saver.\n\n103\n00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.740\nOr we're gonna lock the computer for\nyou, whatever it might be, right?\n\n104\n00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.920\nThat's what you want to end up happening.\n\n105\n00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.080\nSo group policy will help you to do\nsomething like that if you choose to.\n\n106\n00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.544\nNow remember that without group policy,\nwe have to depend on the end user and\n\n107\n00:05:28.544 --> 00:05:32.887\ntheir incredible ability to, first,\nunderstand why it's important.\n\n108\n00:05:32.887 --> 00:05:36.650\nSecondly, to actually be able\nto do it consistently, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.687\nThirdly is to make sure that\nit's actually happened.\n\n110\n00:05:38.687 --> 00:05:41.330\nIn other words, making sure that\nsomebody goes around and does, what?\n\n111\n00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.200\nChecks as people\nare leaving their computer.\n\n112\n00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.720\nSo this would mean if Zach was\na supervisor, after five minutes time,\n\n113\n00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.380\nhe'd have to go over to that computer and\nthen take a look.\n\n114\n00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.750\nIf they're away from their desk, and\nwave it around and go, oop, there it is.\n\n115\n00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.920\nRonnie didn't lock his computer,\nmark one for Ronnie there.\n\n116\n00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.330\nSo somebody has to do\nthat constant monitoring.\n\n117\n00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.200\nBut with group policy,\n\n118\n00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.860\nthough, we essentially can set it and\nforget it, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.420\nSo that's actually a good thing, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.130\nIt doesn't mean that you always wanna\ndo that, you wanna test it first.\n\n121\n00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.810\nBut if it's set the way that you want to,\nyou should be able to set it.\n\n122\n00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.150\nAnd forget it, and\nlet it do what it needs to, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.560\nSo that's kinda the key.\n\n124\n00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.953\n&gt;&gt; So that means then that you can set\nit so that, at the end of the day or\n\n125\n00:06:17.953 --> 00:06:21.600\nwhenever, everything gets\nlocked automatically?\n\n126\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.944\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yeah, and it is, It's\nsomething that, at the end of the day,\n\n127\n00:06:24.944 --> 00:06:26.830\nwould even be better, right?\n\n128\n00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.229\nIt's bad enough that people might do\nthis if they go across the hallway.\n\n129\n00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:32.250\nOr they go up to the third floor and\nshoot the breeze for a moment.\n\n130\n00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.187\nAnd if they're working on something\nthat's sensitive, there it is.\n\n131\n00:06:35.187 --> 00:06:36.867\nTheir computer's actually exposed.\n\n132\n00:06:36.867 --> 00:06:40.580\nThey're logged in, so they have access\nwith their privileges everything.\n\n133\n00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.474\nAnd if somebody's doing something\nmalicious, well, it shows up as,\n\n134\n00:06:43.474 --> 00:06:45.360\nwell, me doing the malicious thing.\n\n135\n00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.973\nDoesn't show up as them coming over to\nyour computer doing something malicious.\n\n136\n00:06:47.973 --> 00:06:50.470\nIt shows up as me doing it maliciously.\n\n137\n00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.529\nSo instead, locking the computer out,\ndoing something like that helps.\n\n138\n00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:54.991\nAnd at the end of the day,\n\n139\n00:06:54.991 --> 00:06:58.971\nif people walk away from it cuz\nit's 5 o'clock on a Friday, okay?\n\n140\n00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:03.426\nAnd like, I'm getting out of here, and\nnow they leave themselves logged in.\n\n141\n00:07:03.426 --> 00:07:04.336\nWho knows, okay?\n\n142\n00:07:04.336 --> 00:07:09.320\nSo setting up a policy like that really\ncan help us out as we begin to do this.\n\n143\n00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.836\nSo having some knowledge and some skills\nto be able to work with group policy on\n\n144\n00:07:12.836 --> 00:07:16.140\na day-to-day basis, or\nat least at the beginning here,\n\n145\n00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.460\nis something you really want to setup and\nto be able to take in mind, okay?\n\n146\n00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.023\nYou're gonna get much more in depth,\nespecially in group policy,\n\n147\n00:07:25.023 --> 00:07:28.238\nas you start moving towards your MCSA and\nMCSE.\n\n148\n00:07:28.238 --> 00:07:31.334\nSo don't stop right here,\nthis is just a beginning point, hopefully,\n\n149\n00:07:31.334 --> 00:07:32.720\nto get you familiar.\n\n150\n00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.970\nBut don't think that\nthis ends your journey\n\n151\n00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.790\nin terms of working with group policy.\n\n152\n00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.090\nWe are kind of opening the curtain\njust a little bit and peeking in.\n\n153\n00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.775\nAnd making sure that we understand that.\n\n154\n00:07:43.775 --> 00:07:46.155\n&gt;&gt; A good IT pro is always learning.\n\n155\n00:07:46.155 --> 00:07:46.775\n&gt;&gt; That is correct.\n\n156\n00:07:46.775 --> 00:07:47.670\n&gt;&gt; That's why we're here.\n\n157\n00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.135\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so\nwhere do we go to set this, okay?\n\n158\n00:07:50.135 --> 00:07:51.358\nThat's what we wanna take a look at.\n\n159\n00:07:51.358 --> 00:07:55.277\nSo let's show you a couple of options that\nyou have right here on my computer screen.\n\n160\n00:07:55.277 --> 00:07:57.488\nSo here it is,\nI'm on my local management computer.\n\n161\n00:07:57.488 --> 00:07:59.610\nThis is just a Windows 10 machine.\n\n162\n00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.258\nAnd there are a couple of settings, and\nthis is where it gets a little confusing,\n\n163\n00:08:03.258 --> 00:08:06.602\nif you have not been dealing in\nthe Active Directly domain world, right.\n\n164\n00:08:06.602 --> 00:08:12.208\nOn your own computers,\nif I were to come in here and\n\n165\n00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:17.545\ngo to the search here,\nI can type in the SEC POL,\n\n166\n00:08:17.545 --> 00:08:23.163\nwhich is shortcut for\nthe Local Security Policy.\n\n167\n00:08:23.163 --> 00:08:26.138\nAnd you can see that there's\nan application right here, and\n\n168\n00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:30.380\nnormally you have to run it as the\nadministrator to be able to do something.\n\n169\n00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.855\nNow, when we do that, here's what\nshould end up showing up is right here,\n\n170\n00:08:34.855 --> 00:08:37.566\nis a screen that says\nLocal Security Policy.\n\n171\n00:08:37.566 --> 00:08:42.290\nAnd you can now see all these settings\nthat essentially apply to that one\n\n172\n00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:43.084\ncomputer.\n\n173\n00:08:43.084 --> 00:08:46.465\nSo you can set Account Policies,\nLocal Policies,\n\n174\n00:08:46.465 --> 00:08:51.780\nWindows Firewall,\nNetwork List Manager Policies, Public Key.\n\n175\n00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:52.987\nAll these are actually different policies.\n\n176\n00:08:52.987 --> 00:08:57.130\nSo if I expand this out,\nI can create a Password Policy.\n\n177\n00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.248\nAnd you can see right here,\n\n178\n00:08:58.248 --> 00:09:00.540\nhere's the actual policies\nthat we would put in place.\n\n179\n00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:06.200\nEnforcing password history, the length\nof the time that I can keep a password,\n\n180\n00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:12.140\nthe minimum age, how long I have to be\nable to keep a password, the link here.\n\n181\n00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:16.001\nSo these, you can actually change and\nset to be able to do that.\n\n182\n00:09:16.001 --> 00:09:20.608\nNow when you do something like\nthis with a local security policy,\n\n183\n00:09:20.608 --> 00:09:23.910\nit's scope is limited to that machine.\n\n184\n00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.076\nThat's pretty much it, okay,\n\n185\n00:09:26.076 --> 00:09:30.820\nso it's limits in what we have to be\nable to set here, it works, okay.\n\n186\n00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.484\nIt will do everything that we really want\nit do in terms of some of the security\n\n187\n00:09:34.484 --> 00:09:36.780\npolicies to be able to do this.\n\n188\n00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.788\nBut the problem comes in is that if we're\nworking with servers a lot of times.\n\n189\n00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:42.253\nWe're probably inside\nan Active Directory domain,\n\n190\n00:09:42.253 --> 00:09:46.340\nwhich means we're probably managing\nmore than just a few computers, okay?\n\n191\n00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.446\nAnd that means for us, that we need to\nactually be able to do this on a more kind\n\n192\n00:09:50.446 --> 00:09:52.578\nof global scale in terms of our domain.\n\n193\n00:09:52.578 --> 00:09:56.819\nSo I'm gonna get out of that, cuz we're\ngonna really only focus in on what we\n\n194\n00:09:56.819 --> 00:10:00.150\ncall the domain based group\npolicy is what we're gonna do.\n\n195\n00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.835\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n196\n00:10:00.835 --> 00:10:05.800\nwhen do something like that we need to add\nand find another tool available for us.\n\n197\n00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.668\nAnd we're in our remote administration\nmachine and we've added in the remote\n\n198\n00:10:10.668 --> 00:10:14.883\nadministration and tools,\nremote server administration tools.\n\n199\n00:10:14.883 --> 00:10:20.740\nThen I scroll down and I look for\nmy Windows Administrative Tools.\n\n200\n00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.675\nFrom here,\nI just continue to scroll down and\n\n201\n00:10:23.675 --> 00:10:27.780\nwhat I'm looking for\nis where it say Group Policy Management.\n\n202\n00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:33.930\nSometimes you'll hear admins call it the\nGPMC, the Group Policy Management Console.\n\n203\n00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.394\nSo if you hear that acronym,\n\n204\n00:10:35.394 --> 00:10:38.810\nthat's probably fairly common\nthat you'll also end up hearing.\n\n205\n00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.246\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't mean we're\nreferring to cars.\n\n206\n00:10:40.246 --> 00:10:42.861\n&gt;&gt; It does not mean you're\nreferring to cars, yes.\n\n207\n00:10:42.861 --> 00:10:43.408\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n208\n00:10:43.408 --> 00:10:46.732\nhere's what we'll end up getting\nonto your screen here, right.\n\n209\n00:10:46.732 --> 00:10:49.460\nSo once you learn that,\nhere's the console that pops up.\n\n210\n00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.720\nAnd that's why it's called GPMC, right.\n\n211\n00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.840\nGroup Policy Management, and\nthis is the console that we see.\n\n212\n00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.460\nNow normally when you take a look at\nthis if everything is not expanded out,\n\n213\n00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.250\nyou might see one of two things here.\n\n214\n00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:06.210\nSo like this one, you'll actually end\nup seeing the entire forest as well\n\n215\n00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.100\nas domains listed underneath it, okay?\n\n216\n00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.181\nThat is what you'll end up seeing.\n\n217\n00:11:10.181 --> 00:11:15.090\nSo that is showing you the scope of things\nthat you can actually apply as well.\n\n218\n00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:19.650\nNow from here, I'm gonna select\nOffice Pro demo co on Microsoft and\n\n219\n00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.330\nthat's my main domain.\n\n220\n00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.130\nAnd then as I expand that out,\n\n221\n00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.172\nyou start to now see where the merging\nof a couple of things happen.\n\n222\n00:11:27.172 --> 00:11:31.762\nInside of Active Directory,\nit uses a computers, well, we do see here\n\n223\n00:11:31.762 --> 00:11:37.270\nare some OUs that carried over from\nthe Active Directory user's computers.\n\n224\n00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:38.907\nSo, we have the domain.\n\n225\n00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:40.610\nWe have Domain Controllers.\n\n226\n00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.334\nHere's one that I created right here, LKC.\n\n227\n00:11:43.334 --> 00:11:46.170\nOffice 365, I created that as well.\n\n228\n00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.840\nSo, these are kind of\nthe ones that I created.\n\n229\n00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.901\nThe other groups that we actually\nhad that are over there, containers,\n\n230\n00:11:51.901 --> 00:11:52.866\nthey didn't come in.\n\n231\n00:11:52.866 --> 00:11:55.679\nBut these particular OUs did.\n\n232\n00:11:55.679 --> 00:12:00.224\nSo organizational units are normally\nwhere we start to place, well,\n\n233\n00:12:00.224 --> 00:12:02.312\nthings like group policy here.\n\n234\n00:12:02.312 --> 00:12:06.430\nSo now when you start to do this,\nI can also expand this out.\n\n235\n00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.807\nAnd now notice,\nI have actually OUs within OUs as well,\n\n236\n00:12:10.807 --> 00:12:15.201\nwhich are normally also inside\nof the domain there too.\n\n237\n00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:17.850\n&gt;&gt; So this is another example of nesting?\n\n238\n00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.650\n&gt;&gt; It is another example of nesting,\nand that's actually a good point, and\n\n239\n00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:24.989\nwe'll make a big deal about nesting\nin a little bit of time here.\n\n240\n00:12:24.989 --> 00:12:26.153\n&gt;&gt; Nesting.\n&gt;&gt; But overall though,\n\n241\n00:12:26.153 --> 00:12:26.978\nyou start seeing this.\n\n242\n00:12:26.978 --> 00:12:28.997\nNow, what about those policies?\n\n243\n00:12:28.997 --> 00:12:31.982\nI'm not anything like the local\npolicy I just showed you.\n\n244\n00:12:31.982 --> 00:12:36.170\nWell, that's because these policies\nare set a little bit differently.\n\n245\n00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:41.330\nThey can, and here there's actually\na couple of default policies here.\n\n246\n00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.238\nThere's actually one called the default\ndomain policy, so that makes sense.\n\n247\n00:12:44.238 --> 00:12:46.860\nAll right, default domain policy.\n\n248\n00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.895\nAnd then under the domain controllers OU,\nthere's actually another one.\n\n249\n00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:54.530\nSo let me see, I have to kind of zoom\nin and zoom out just a little bit.\n\n250\n00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.891\nDon't mean to make everybody kind of ill\nin watching me, there's also this one.\n\n251\n00:12:58.891 --> 00:13:06.180\nThe domain default, excuse me, default\ndomain controller's policy as well.\n\n252\n00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.998\nSo on each one of these here, okay,\nyou can see this little blue arrow that\n\n253\n00:13:10.998 --> 00:13:14.884\nyou see right here on the edge\non the lower left hand corner,\n\n254\n00:13:14.884 --> 00:13:18.580\nwhich indicates that this is\na link of some sort, okay.\n\n255\n00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:24.020\nThe actual policy itself is stored\nunder Group Policy Objects.\n\n256\n00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.994\nNow if I expand that out,\nhere's where the real policies are.\n\n257\n00:13:26.994 --> 00:13:30.090\nAnd what happens is you\ncreate a policy here.\n\n258\n00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.549\nAnd then you can link the policy\nto the object that you would\n\n259\n00:13:34.549 --> 00:13:37.080\nchoose to link it to, okay?\n\n260\n00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.810\nAnd that will set the scope of the policy\nand the limitation of the policy.\n\n261\n00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:44.711\nYou can have a policy and set it up\nhere at this level right here and\n\n262\n00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:48.980\nthen that actually applies to\neverything underneath it, okay?\n\n263\n00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.740\nAt the domain level if you do that,\nthat's what ends up happening.\n\n264\n00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.247\nSo that's what you end up seeing and\nthen so wherever we actually place it,\n\n265\n00:13:55.247 --> 00:13:58.980\nthat's where it will actually get\nits limitation in the scope as well.\n\n266\n00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.350\nAnd the idea of nesting,\nit also applies to those nested groups.\n\n267\n00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:03.390\nNow let's take a look at\none of these policies.\n\n268\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.357\nLet's just select the default\ndomain policy for right now.\n\n269\n00:14:06.357 --> 00:14:10.480\nAnd if I right click on that,\nI'm going to select edit.\n\n270\n00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.100\nNow, I'm just showing you this.\n\n271\n00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.814\nUsually the best practice\nhere is not to edit or\n\n272\n00:14:16.814 --> 00:14:19.870\ndo anything with\nthe default domain policy.\n\n273\n00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.390\nBut it's to create your own policies here.\n\n274\n00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:27.780\nNow this begins to look a little bit more\nlike the local policy that we just saw.\n\n275\n00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.494\nNow when you actually do create\na domain base policy here and\n\n276\n00:14:31.494 --> 00:14:36.779\nyou start to see this, you'll see it's\nbroken up into two configurations, okay?\n\n277\n00:14:36.779 --> 00:14:43.120\nThere is Computer Configuration and\nthere's also a User Configuration as well.\n\n278\n00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.556\nOkay, so\nwhen you start to take a look at that,\n\n279\n00:14:45.556 --> 00:14:49.685\nnotice that each one of those is also\nbroken up into Policies and Preferences.\n\n280\n00:14:49.685 --> 00:14:51.324\nPolicies and Preferences, so\n\n281\n00:14:51.324 --> 00:14:54.860\nremember I told you that the idea\nof creating one actually is easy.\n\n282\n00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.503\nAnd I'll show you in a little bit,\ncreating one is easy, but\n\n283\n00:14:58.503 --> 00:15:03.380\nactually configuring one is a little\nbit tougher, because within, even this.\n\n284\n00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.324\nSo even if I select policies here,\nZack, and I expand this out.\n\n285\n00:15:07.324 --> 00:15:11.822\nNotice that there's actually three\nsubcategories underneath that, Software,\n\n286\n00:15:11.822 --> 00:15:15.920\nWindows Settings, and\nAdministrative Templates as well.\n\n287\n00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.382\nEven if I expand out Windows Settings\nhere, let's see if that actually does it.\n\n288\n00:15:19.382 --> 00:15:23.250\nNotice that actually gives me\neven more to drill down into.\n\n289\n00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:28.477\nAnd normally the one that I'm working with\nis gonna be underneath security policies,\n\n290\n00:15:28.477 --> 00:15:31.690\nSecurity Settings, and\nnow you can see right here.\n\n291\n00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.800\nZack, look at all this that's\nactually listed from here to there.\n\n292\n00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.480\nThere is a ton, okay?\n\n293\n00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.086\nSo you're not talking about just\nadjusting or just taking a look and\n\n294\n00:15:41.086 --> 00:15:42.420\nseeing something here.\n\n295\n00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:47.024\nThese are hundreds, if not thousands\nof possible things that you can see,\n\n296\n00:15:47.024 --> 00:15:48.660\nin terms of objects.\n\n297\n00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.524\nNow once you get to those objects, so\n\n298\n00:15:50.524 --> 00:15:53.423\nthis is like I said where it\ngets a little more confusing.\n\n299\n00:15:53.423 --> 00:15:57.659\nSo lets say that we want to set that and\nwhat we were talking about bit earlier,\n\n300\n00:15:57.659 --> 00:16:01.065\nsuch as, lets just do like\nan account lock out policy, okay?\n\n301\n00:16:01.065 --> 00:16:05.195\nSo if I select account policies,\nand then account lockout policy,\n\n302\n00:16:05.195 --> 00:16:10.070\nnotice that I also have what,\nthree different settings in here, okay?\n\n303\n00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:16.279\nSo each one of these gives us\nthat ability to kind of see on,\n\n304\n00:16:16.279 --> 00:16:21.690\nman it takes a lot before you\nkind of figure everything out.\n\n305\n00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:24.160\nSo, we're gonna actually\ntake a look at that as well.\n\n306\n00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.680\nSo, in here we've just kind of showed you\nthat, yes, you can have local policy.\n\n307\n00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.770\nAnd then, you can also see here,\nin the domain policy as well.\n\n308\n00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:38.040\nSo, those are kind of the two\nbig separations that we have.\n\n309\n00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.280\nAnd then you'll see how\ncomplex this gets us too.\n\n310\n00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.910\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, when should either be used?\n\n311\n00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.120\n&gt;&gt; That's actually a good question.\n\n312\n00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.640\nBecause in theory you can use\nboth of them at the same time.\n\n313\n00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.080\nIs it a good thing to do?\n\n314\n00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.790\nNot necessarily.\n\n315\n00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.720\nBest rule of thumb is this,\n\n316\n00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.458\nif you're inside of\nan Active Directory network, right?\n\n317\n00:16:57.458 --> 00:17:00.675\nIf your computer's domain\njoined to that network,\n\n318\n00:17:00.675 --> 00:17:05.660\nthen leaving the local group policy alone\nis kind of a best practice here, okay?\n\n319\n00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.422\nNow if you don't have\nan Active Directory domain,\n\n320\n00:17:09.422 --> 00:17:14.240\nthen setting local group policy\nis actually a good thing.\n\n321\n00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.260\nSo if you're working inside\nof what we call a work group,\n\n322\n00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.966\nthe local policy will\nwork fairly effectively.\n\n323\n00:17:18.966 --> 00:17:24.110\nBut when you actually do start to put\nthis into an Active Directory domain,\n\n324\n00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:27.470\ncan there be times when one\nsetting may conflict with another?\n\n325\n00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:28.950\nYou better believe it, but\n\n326\n00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.660\nthis is where it actually does apply when\nwe start time of linking the policies and\n\n327\n00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:36.050\nthat there's an order of preference\nthat will end up happening.\n\n328\n00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:40.420\nBut that's where it gets a little bit more\nunusual because it can become complex,\n\n329\n00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.170\nespecially if you have nested groups and\n\n330\n00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.750\nyou have different things to actually\nfigure out which one applies where.\n\n331\n00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.380\nAnd we're gonna get into\nthat a little bit when\n\n332\n00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.040\nwe get into the troubleshooting\npart of this.\n\n333\n00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.250\nBut that's gonna be saved for\na different episode.\n\n334\n00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.585\nBut for right now, just kinda realize\nthat if you have Active Directory,\n\n335\n00:17:54.585 --> 00:17:59.330\nits domain services up and running,\nthen we want you to use the group\n\n336\n00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:03.710\npolicy management console to do what we\nwanna do, and to limit the scope there.\n\n337\n00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:04.740\nYou don't have that,\n\n338\n00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.730\nthen the local policy is probably\nthe way that you'll end up applying it.\n\n339\n00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:11.050\nSo that's kinda the best rule\nof thumb when you do this, okay?\n\n340\n00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:14.700\nAll right, so\nnow that we've kind of got a setting here,\n\n341\n00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.940\nwe wanna also show you a little\nbit more on some of the complexity\n\n342\n00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.290\nas we start to create a policy here, okay?\n\n343\n00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:26.620\nSo, the idea of actually\nhaving these group policies,\n\n344\n00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:30.470\nright, it really is kind of a two\nstep process at this point.\n\n345\n00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.830\nOne, is we create it, okay?\n\n346\n00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:36.650\nThen secondly,\nwe actually have to attach it or\n\n347\n00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:42.510\napply it to one of those different OUs\nthat we want to attach it to, okay?\n\n348\n00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.180\nSo that's kind of a two step process.\n\n349\n00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:49.170\nNow, as simple as the creation\ngoes that I just told you,\n\n350\n00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.830\nit's really not that simple, okay?\n\n351\n00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.222\nNow, let me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n352\n00:18:52.222 --> 00:18:55.620\nSo let's go ahead and\ncreate one is what we want to do.\n\n353\n00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.570\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna close out of this editor,\n\n354\n00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:05.010\nwhich is on the default domain policy,\nand let's create a new one.\n\n355\n00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:10.170\nIf I right click on Group Policy Objects\nhere, I can select New,\n\n356\n00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:16.290\nand now all I have to do is\nsimply create a new policy.\n\n357\n00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:21.120\nSo let's say, for example,\nthat we wanna go ahead and\n\n358\n00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.880\nchange the password policy, okay?\n\n359\n00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.840\nThat's a good one for us.\n\n360\n00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.790\nSo let's do that.\n\n361\n00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.380\nAnd let's do this for the publicity here.\n\n362\n00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:32.441\nSo we'll actually call this one,\nPublicity,\n\n363\n00:19:32.441 --> 00:19:37.122\nif I spelled it right,\nhopefully, Password Policy.\n\n364\n00:19:37.122 --> 00:19:42.197\nAll right, now just by default I'm\nnot gonna worry about doing this,\n\n365\n00:19:42.197 --> 00:19:46.843\nas you want to learn more about\nthis other setting that's here,\n\n366\n00:19:46.843 --> 00:19:49.875\nremember to take a look at the MCSA shows.\n\n367\n00:19:49.875 --> 00:19:53.386\nBut for right now we're just gonna\ncreate a very simple one, click OK.\n\n368\n00:19:53.386 --> 00:19:56.138\nAll right, there it is.\n\n369\n00:19:56.138 --> 00:19:58.490\nWe have created a policy, okay?\n\n370\n00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.480\nNow the problem is fairly simple,\n\n371\n00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.260\neverything in our current policy\nright now is undefined, okay?\n\n372\n00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:10.010\nAnd that means it's a blank policy, it's\nessentially a form, it really is, right?\n\n373\n00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:14.950\nSo it's like when you get handed a form,\nall this stuff is supposed be there,\n\n374\n00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:16.310\nit's just not.\n\n375\n00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.760\nSo it gives you that form\nto be able to fill out.\n\n376\n00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:24.040\nSo now if I want to set this publicity\npolicy, I can right click and I can edit.\n\n377\n00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.860\nSo I am partially,\nthe way that I talk about creating,\n\n378\n00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.250\nI created a name of\na policy is what I did.\n\n379\n00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:31.710\nAnd I have a template for\n\n380\n00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:36.350\na policy, but I really don't have anything\nelse set up here to be able to do.\n\n381\n00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.880\nSo when you start to choose here, when you\nstart talking about password policies,\n\n382\n00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.987\nwhere do password policies apply, okay?\n\n383\n00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:48.000\nSo if I want it to apply, notice that\nI have to choose now between computer\n\n384\n00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.210\nconfiguration and\nuser configuration here, okay?\n\n385\n00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.480\nNow if I want it to\napply to certain users,\n\n386\n00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.400\nI can use this user\nconfiguration to apply it there.\n\n387\n00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:03.100\nSo if I expand that out and\ngo to Windows and then Security Settings.\n\n388\n00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.460\nNotice that this one doesn't have it.\n\n389\n00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.520\nSo it means, hey, you can't do that.\n\n390\n00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.040\nSo what is it actually gonna do?\n\n391\n00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.930\nIt's gonna lead me up here to\nthe computer configuration.\n\n392\n00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.910\nThat says, look,\nif you're gonna apply a password policy,\n\n393\n00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.980\nyou have to apply it at the computer,\nwhich is gonna apply to everybody that\n\n394\n00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.112\ntries to log into those computers,\nall right?\n\n395\n00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:27.098\nAt that point I expand out Windows\nSettings and then Security Settings here.\n\n396\n00:21:27.098 --> 00:21:31.168\nNow being able to figure out which is\nwhich after awhile is what I showed you at\n\n397\n00:21:31.168 --> 00:21:32.490\nthe beginning.\n\n398\n00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.110\nIt's testing, and then somebody says,\nis there a password policy?\n\n399\n00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.920\nI know there's a password policy,\nbut it didn't appear in there.\n\n400\n00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.870\nLet me try the other one.\n\n401\n00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:41.450\nThat's the way that I\nlearned how to do it.\n\n402\n00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:42.750\nA little bit more.\n\n403\n00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.790\nSo it's kind of an easy way, but\n\n404\n00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:47.870\nit actually lets you explore\na little bit more as you have time.\n\n405\n00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:52.010\nFrom here, if I select Account Policies,\nthere it is.\n\n406\n00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:55.480\nThere is the password policy\nthat I want to be able to set.\n\n407\n00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.680\nSo from here it's fairly easy.\n\n408\n00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.450\nNotice that nothing is defined,\njust like I said.\n\n409\n00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:04.450\nYou saw in the default policy, though we\nactually did see where it was like seven\n\n410\n00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:07.740\ncharacters long and\n42 days or whatever it is.\n\n411\n00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.488\nIf I wanna force a password\nhistory I simply click on that\n\n412\n00:22:11.488 --> 00:22:17.110\none since it's not defined right now and\nthen I can define this setting.\n\n413\n00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.180\nPutting a check mark there,\nhow many passwords do I want to remember?\n\n414\n00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.012\nI think the max is 24.\n\n415\n00:22:22.012 --> 00:22:25.602\nIf I'm not ever sure about what\nthat actually is gonna be,\n\n416\n00:22:25.602 --> 00:22:30.190\nI can click on Explain, and\nfrom there, you can see, there it is.\n\n417\n00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:31.530\nOn domain controllers, 24.\n\n418\n00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.470\nOn stand-alone servers, 0.\n\n419\n00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.450\nIt's not gonna remember anything.\n\n420\n00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.340\nSo it gives you a little bit more of that,\n\n421\n00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:41.130\nthis is the maximum value between 0 and\n24.\n\n422\n00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.210\nRead through these things as you're\ngetting curious about them so\n\n423\n00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:46.140\nthat you understand what this is doing.\n\n424\n00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.170\nNow the great thing is this\nis an easy one, Zack, okay?\n\n425\n00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:52.110\nSo let's say I wanna keep 24,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n426\n00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.710\nAll right, click Apply and click OK.\n\n427\n00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:58.665\nAnd then we can change\nall the rest of this.\n\n428\n00:22:58.665 --> 00:23:00.840\nBut you'll take the time\nto be able to do that.\n\n429\n00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.940\nWe're not gonna go through explaining\neach one of these options for right now.\n\n430\n00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:08.540\nBut I did wanna show you the reason\nwhy this becomes more complex, okay?\n\n431\n00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:12.450\nIt becomes more complex\nbecause there are double\n\n432\n00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:15.950\nunusual negatives that are in here, okay?\n\n433\n00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.860\nSo I'm gonna see if Zack\ncan actually catch this one\n\n434\n00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.340\nas we go through and see it.\n\n435\n00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.040\nSo I'm gonna close out of that one and\n\n436\n00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.928\nthen also select Policies\nunder User Configuration.\n\n437\n00:23:25.928 --> 00:23:31.353\nWindows Settings here, let me see,\n\n438\n00:23:31.353 --> 00:23:36.110\nmaybe- Let's see.\n\n439\n00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:37.960\nI may be telling you wrong,\nhere, let me verify.\n\n440\n00:23:39.274 --> 00:23:42.149\nAdministrative templates, I was like hey,\nI'm not in the right place.\n\n441\n00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:46.575\nAdministrative templates here, and\n\n442\n00:23:46.575 --> 00:23:52.112\nonce I'm in here,\nI need Windows Components.\n\n443\n00:23:52.112 --> 00:23:55.579\nAnd under Windows Components,\nInternet Explorer.\n\n444\n00:23:55.579 --> 00:23:58.160\nAnd under Internet Explorer,\nInternet Control Panel.\n\n445\n00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.771\nYou see how deep this is going, Zack?\n\n446\n00:23:59.771 --> 00:24:02.401\nI mean, imagine trying to find one.\n\n447\n00:24:02.401 --> 00:24:06.320\nAnd then this Advanced Page\nhere is what I want to have.\n\n448\n00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.310\nNow, all the policies that are set\nare over here on the right-hand side.\n\n449\n00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:14.960\nNow, you take a look at that Zack, tell me\nthat that's not intimidating to try and\n\n450\n00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.140\nlook for a single setting, okay?\n\n451\n00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:17.920\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n452\n00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.900\n&gt;&gt; It's intimidating as crazy.\n\n453\n00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:25.770\nBut once you say, hey, that's\nintimidating, you're not exactly done yet.\n\n454\n00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:28.390\nAnd the reason why is that\nthere is a setting in here.\n\n455\n00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:32.540\nI have to kind of, I'm gonna alphabetize\nthem and see, well maybe it is,\n\n456\n00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.320\nis it under?\n\n457\n00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.300\nHold on, I went too far.\n\n458\n00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.490\nSo I don't need to be in Advanced Page,\n\n459\n00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.030\nI need to be up here at\nInternet Control Panel.\n\n460\n00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.900\nSee, once again,\nI kind of didn't see that.\n\n461\n00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.010\nThen we're gonna look right here, okay?\n\n462\n00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:47.270\nNotice what this says\nin terms of the policy.\n\n463\n00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.080\nSee the way that that's worded?\n\n464\n00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.580\nDisable the Advanced page.\n\n465\n00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:54.550\nNow, if you were to take that verb,\nwhat do you think disabled means?\n\n466\n00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:55.730\n&gt;&gt; Turn the sucker off.\n\n467\n00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:56.300\n&gt;&gt; Turn it off.\n\n468\n00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.460\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That's what you would\n\n469\n00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.230\nabsolutely think it means, okay?\n\n470\n00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:01.700\nNotice that it's not configured here.\n\n471\n00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.750\nSo if it's not configured,\nit means it doesn't apply, which is fine.\n\n472\n00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:14.608\nBut what does it mean to enable\na disabled advanced page.\n\n473\n00:25:14.608 --> 00:25:16.905\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Isn't that like a double negative?\n\n474\n00:25:16.905 --> 00:25:19.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's two negatives there.\n\n475\n00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.995\n&gt;&gt; But then, what does it mean to\ndisable a disable advanced page.\n\n476\n00:25:25.995 --> 00:25:28.865\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna be, call Batman.\n\n477\n00:25:28.865 --> 00:25:31.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm trying\n\n478\n00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.940\nto show you is that there are some\nsettings like that, right?\n\n479\n00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:34.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n480\n00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:38.690\n&gt;&gt; That really are insanely confusing,\nokay?\n\n481\n00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:41.680\nAnd this is not to intimidate you, it's to\nlet you know you're gonna run across this\n\n482\n00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.630\nand you're gonna go, well,\nthat's a little bit unusual.\n\n483\n00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:50.740\nIf I am able to disable the advanced page,\nwell,\n\n484\n00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:55.200\nthat's where you have this help,\nright here, to hopefully help you out.\n\n485\n00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:02.770\nSo now, notice it says, if you enable\nthis policy right here, let's see,\n\n486\n00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:08.170\nif you enable this policy, users\nare prevented from seeing and changing\n\n487\n00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:13.210\nthe advanced internet settings, such\nas security, multimedia, and printing.\n\n488\n00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:17.310\nThat didn't make sense at all.\n\n489\n00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:20.300\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; But sure, why not?\n\n490\n00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:25.860\n&gt;&gt; So it sounds like you're trying to\nenable a switch, if you will, a function.\n\n491\n00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.750\n&gt;&gt; It can, but remember, you have to pay\nattention to what this actually says.\n\n492\n00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.860\nSo it's saying if you enable this,\n\n493\n00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.370\nif you turn this on,\nyou're essentially disabling it.\n\n494\n00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:36.270\nAll right?\n\n495\n00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.090\nSo what does disabling means?\n\n496\n00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:42.870\nSo if you disable this policy or\n\n497\n00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:46.606\ndo not configure it,\nusers can see and change the setting.\n\n498\n00:26:46.606 --> 00:26:50.998\n[LAUGH]\nGo figure.\n\n499\n00:26:50.998 --> 00:26:56.690\nSo, just as an example, when I say, and\nyou look at this and go, we have password.\n\n500\n00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:00.830\nEasy, I can logically understand that,\nto a point.\n\n501\n00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:05.290\nIn group policy, you're gonna logically\nunderstand everything that you're gonna\n\n502\n00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:08.840\nsee, until that point where you're not\ngonna understand everything that you see,\n\n503\n00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.080\nsuch as what I showed you here.\n\n504\n00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.130\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, if we're looking\nat a complex configuration,\n\n505\n00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:15.210\ncan we use PowerShell to\nhelp us with that or no?\n\n506\n00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:17.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you definitely can.\n\n507\n00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.830\nYou can use that as long as you\nknow what the settings mean.\n\n508\n00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.290\nYou still have to deal with\nthis confusing language here.\n\n509\n00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.390\nBut you do end up getting a sense that,\n\n510\n00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:29.390\nyes, you can, as long as you kind of\nunderstand what the settings are.\n\n511\n00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:31.370\nBut it really is about that.\n\n512\n00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:36.120\nSo normally, the weird thing behind\nPowerShell, in this instance,\n\n513\n00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.120\neven though I think later on we're gonna\nshow you a little bit of PowerShell here,\n\n514\n00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.830\nbut when we start to see this,\nyou're gonna find out something.\n\n515\n00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.530\nThis is one of the instances\nin which PowerShell\n\n516\n00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:50.050\nis not gonna be as helpful as\nwe want it to be as helpful for.\n\n517\n00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:54.170\nAnd the reason why is because, normally,\nwhen we configure group policy,\n\n518\n00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.730\nit's not on a day to day basis that\nwe're actually creating new policies.\n\n519\n00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:02.030\nAnd normally, we're not actually\ncreating a ton of them at one time.\n\n520\n00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.102\nSo where Power Shell\nhelps us in efficiency,\n\n521\n00:28:04.102 --> 00:28:07.360\nthis one, you really have to slow down.\n\n522\n00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.451\nIf this was the first time I told you,\nset this up, and\n\n523\n00:28:10.451 --> 00:28:15.140\n[LAUGH] and you're going, okay,\nso which one should I choose?\n\n524\n00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.990\nWell, you figure it out.\n\n525\n00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:19.200\nAnd then you'd have to kind\nof be able to do that.\n\n526\n00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:24.080\nSo being able to type out the Power Shell\nscript, we can create the policy.\n\n527\n00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.620\nWe can configure it to enable it,\nbut do we know what that means?\n\n528\n00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:30.430\nAnd that's where group policy\nreally isn't gonna help us out,\n\n529\n00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:31.720\nwhen we start to see it.\n\n530\n00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.660\nSo, yes, you can actually do\nall of the things that we\n\n531\n00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.990\nshowed you right here in PowerShell,\nto be able to set what we want to.\n\n532\n00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:39.790\nYou name it, it can all be done.\n\n533\n00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:43.530\nYou can definitely do stuff\nlike this as you continue to\n\n534\n00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:50.160\nkind of work with the group policy\nsettings a little bit more.\n\n535\n00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.810\nBut, is it confusing?\n\n536\n00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:54.530\nAt times, definitely confusing.\n\n537\n00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:55.940\nDoes that mean every time you see it?\n\n538\n00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:56.940\nNo, okay.\n\n539\n00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:00.770\nThere's a majority of them, which you're\ngonna see fairly straightforward.\n\n540\n00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:06.940\nBut something like that where it's buried\nsix folders deep or whatever it might be.\n\n541\n00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.920\nAnd then, now having to figure out\nif I enable a disabled policy,\n\n542\n00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.410\ndoes that disable it or does that enable?\n\n543\n00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.210\nWhat happens here?\n\n544\n00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.590\nThat's a bit more confusing, right?\n\n545\n00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:21.290\nSo this is one of those instances where\n\n546\n00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:25.260\nunderstanding what the PowerShell\nscripting is gonna do.\n\n547\n00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:29.560\nIt's not helpful if you never dealt\nwith this, so my recommendation at\n\n548\n00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:35.980\nthe beginning is that you spend time\nin the learning some of this stuff and\n\n549\n00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.230\ngetting around and understand that\nconfiguration a little bit more.\n\n550\n00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:43.440\nOnce you get that done, then learning\nthe partial gets you faster at\n\n551\n00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:48.230\ndoing some of those task [INAUDIBLE]\nshould be assigned to be able to do.\n\n552\n00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:51.690\nBut until that point,\nit's really not gonna be that helpful.\n\n553\n00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:53.664\nSo just kind of take a look.\n\n554\n00:29:53.664 --> 00:29:57.140\nNow, let me finish up this configuration\ncuz I keep talking more and\n\n555\n00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.560\nmore, cuz this is a really\na fairly deep subject.\n\n556\n00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.960\nSo I only configured one setting,\n\n557\n00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:06.010\nwhich was that password and that 24\npassword settings that we end up doing.\n\n558\n00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:11.190\nSo once that's done, and everything\nis over, the second part of this step\n\n559\n00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:16.000\nis that now that we have it, it's in\nhere but it's not linked to anything.\n\n560\n00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.970\nSo I don't have anything to actually\nlink it to from what I want.\n\n561\n00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:24.578\nNow, that means,\nat this point, you can link it.\n\n562\n00:30:24.578 --> 00:30:30.920\nIf I right-click on the policy itself,\nyou can go to, let's see stats note.\n\n563\n00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.230\nI wasn't sure if I could\nlink it from here.\n\n564\n00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.250\nI can't, okay?\n\n565\n00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:37.559\nSo this is where you would actually be\nable to, instead, change up like this.\n\n566\n00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:44.060\nI want to take that publicity\npassword policy and\n\n567\n00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.020\nlink it to the publicity OU.\n\n568\n00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:47.968\nThat's my hope.\n\n569\n00:30:47.968 --> 00:30:52.730\nWell, I can right click and\nthen now l can link an existing GPO.\n\n570\n00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.040\nSo, if l link an existing GPO\nthat means that already exists,\n\n571\n00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.390\nwhich is what ours is,\nthen I simply select that.\n\n572\n00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:04.870\nAnd now, you actually see where it says,\nhey, Group Policy Object.\n\n573\n00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:10.530\nNotice, on this Group Policy Object, it\nalready has, in this domain, that's fine.\n\n574\n00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:13.070\nI wanna be able to select that one,\nthe one that I created,\n\n575\n00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:15.050\nwhich is the publicity one.\n\n576\n00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:16.590\nClick OK.\n\n577\n00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:22.440\nAnd now, if I expand out Publicity,\nI will now see it linked here, okay?\n\n578\n00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.660\nNow do you have to do it that way?\n\n579\n00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.830\nNo, okay?\n\n580\n00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:27.990\nThey made this a little\nbit more efficient, but\n\n581\n00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:31.540\nI did wanna show you the two-step\nprocess here to build this.\n\n582\n00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.630\nIf I wanna right click,\nlet's on Office 365,\n\n583\n00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:38.750\nnotice I can create a GPO and\nlink it directly here.\n\n584\n00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:42.230\nSo it gives me the ability to do it\nin one step if I choose to instead.\n\n585\n00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:46.260\nSo if I say here on Office 365, and\n\n586\n00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:54.881\nI can call this one Default Office\n\n587\n00:31:54.881 --> 00:32:02.060\n365 Policy.\n\n588\n00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.160\nGet myself locked out of it.\n\n589\n00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:09.060\nClick in, and now you'll see that\nit ended up creating a link here.\n\n590\n00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:13.510\nBut at the same time, let me get out of\nthat, notice it also created it down here.\n\n591\n00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.730\nIt does give you that ability to do both,\nbut\n\n592\n00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.420\nIf you start off right away doing that,\nthat's probably what you'll end up doing.\n\n593\n00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.410\nBut understanding it as a two step\nprocess, all the policies that\n\n594\n00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:25.770\nyou create will end up getting\ncreated here and then linking them.\n\n595\n00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:27.790\nIf you wanna unlink it,\nit's fairly simple.\n\n596\n00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:33.490\nYou, again, just simply right click and\nthen you can delete the link here.\n\n597\n00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:39.030\nAnd when you delete the link, notice\nit didn't get rid of the policy either.\n\n598\n00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.290\nSo it still allows you\nthen to now move and\n\n599\n00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:44.950\napply it to a different\nOU if you chose to.\n\n600\n00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:48.350\nThese are all different settings\nthat we have available,\n\n601\n00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.730\nbut there's actually a bit more for\nus to actually cover.\n\n602\n00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:54.900\nBut Zach, again,\nI have talked way too long.\n\n603\n00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:59.370\nAnd that means we do have to head into\na part two at some point, because if not,\n\n604\n00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:02.086\nI'll continue like this for\nan hour or more.\n\n605\n00:33:02.086 --> 00:33:05.430\n&gt;&gt; Well, we wouldn't mind that\nthough cuz you did such a great job.\n\n606\n00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:09.795\nWindow Server 101 group policy, working\nwith group policy, this is part one.\n\n607\n00:33:09.795 --> 00:33:13.500\nThere'll be a part two and\nyou wanna make sure you catch that.\n\n608\n00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:18.230\nAnd you're watching ITPro.TV,\na good IT pro is always learning and so\n\n609\n00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:19.980\nshould we all, yes?\n\n610\n00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:20.850\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n611\n00:33:20.850 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:14.460\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Server 101 series.\n\n4\n00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.770\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.800\nIn this episode,\nwe'll be taking a look at group policy.\n\n6\n00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.841\nNow Ronnie has already came in to\nthe studio and explained part one but\n\n7\n00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:25.313\nwe're gonna go ahead and\ncontinue that conversation.\n\n8\n00:00:25.313 --> 00:00:26.805\nAnd he's back with us today.\n\n9\n00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:27.520\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n10\n00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.886\n&gt;&gt; It's going better today,\nwe are ready to get started and\n\n11\n00:00:30.886 --> 00:00:33.915\ntake a look at our second\npart in group policy here.\n\n12\n00:00:33.915 --> 00:00:37.532\nAnd we wanna make sure that we\nunderstand what you're also going to\n\n13\n00:00:37.532 --> 00:00:38.930\nbe seeing, right?\n\n14\n00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.043\nSo if you remember a little bit back in\nthe part one where we pretty much told you\n\n15\n00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.389\nwhat group policy does.\n\n16\n00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:49.238\nWe also showed you some of the confusing\nthings about group policy logically when\n\n17\n00:00:49.238 --> 00:00:50.890\nyou have to deal with them.\n\n18\n00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.990\nAnd we discussed that when\ncreating the group policy,\n\n19\n00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.470\nit really is a two-step process.\n\n20\n00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.510\nNow can you do both steps at one time?\n\n21\n00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.570\nYes, we do have a shortcut\nto allow us to do that.\n\n22\n00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.129\nBut when we're first beginning in our\nserver administration and understanding\n\n23\n00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.629\nit, keeping it as a two step process is\nsomething that helps us to double check,\n\n24\n00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:10.114\nverify that everything is good.\n\n25\n00:01:10.114 --> 00:01:13.335\nSo remember that you have to\ncreate the policy first and\n\n26\n00:01:13.335 --> 00:01:17.886\nthen you can link it to well whichever OU\nyou want to link it to in that chain that\n\n27\n00:01:17.886 --> 00:01:21.720\nwe actually end up seeing or\nthat hierarchy that we see.\n\n28\n00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.890\nSo we're actually still taking\na look at that aspect of it and\n\n29\n00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.120\nthere's still more for us to discuss.\n\n30\n00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.410\nSo what we wanna do of course is just\ndive back in to group policy and\n\n31\n00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.571\nwe'll see a little bit more\nthat we have to take a look at.\n\n32\n00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:35.180\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronny when we\nlook at this term group policy,\n\n33\n00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.440\nthere's also another option\nthat's called Preferences,\n\n34\n00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.210\nhow can we discern between the two, or\nwhat's the big glaring difference here?\n\n35\n00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.852\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that actually is a great question\nbecause this is where people get confused\n\n36\n00:01:45.852 --> 00:01:46.970\nfor the very first time.\n\n37\n00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.953\nThe term policy for us seems to go hand\nin hand with everything else that we do,\n\n38\n00:01:51.953 --> 00:01:54.914\nand the daily workforce of being in IT.\n\n39\n00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:58.799\nWe follow some type of compliance policy\nor some type of personnel policy, or\n\n40\n00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.290\ndress policy, or whatever it might be.\n\n41\n00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.699\nSo a policy for us gives us that boundary,\nright, that ability to say.\n\n42\n00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:06.960\nHey, here's what we expect.\n\n43\n00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.670\nHere's what is going to happen.\n\n44\n00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.220\nAnd this is what we do.\n\n45\n00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.293\nNow when we start to take a look at it,\nlet's take a look at how it looks in group\n\n46\n00:02:14.293 --> 00:02:16.691\npolicy first and, and\nthe way that we see it.\n\n47\n00:02:16.691 --> 00:02:19.050\nAnd then we'll talk about\nthe differences between them.\n\n48\n00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.350\nAnd hopefully that will help us out.\n\n49\n00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.210\nSo here it is on my machine, I've got the\nGroup Policy Management console opened up.\n\n50\n00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.350\nAnd you can actually see it right here,\n\n51\n00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.710\nwhere it says\nthe Group Policy Management Console.\n\n52\n00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.470\nI am on my remote machine, so\n\n53\n00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.660\nI'm using the Windows Server\nRemote Administration tools.\n\n54\n00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.910\nThen of course we are gonna take a look\nover here on the left-hand side in\n\n55\n00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.960\nour navigation pane so that we can\nsee a few other things here, okay.\n\n56\n00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.624\nSo notice that as we start scrolling\ndown I'm gonna take this as our\n\n57\n00:02:48.624 --> 00:02:53.808\nexample to inspect the group policy\na little bit you know more in-depth.\n\n58\n00:02:53.808 --> 00:02:56.231\nSo remember that when we create objects,\nor\n\n59\n00:02:56.231 --> 00:02:59.700\ngroup policy objects they really\nare created in this container\n\n60\n00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.910\nright here where all the policies\nare gonna be stored which is fine.\n\n61\n00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.850\nAnd then from this point when we want\nto apply them depending on what we want\n\n62\n00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.550\nthe scope of that policy to apply\nthat's when we attach them to,\n\n63\n00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.970\nwell here it is it's attached\nto the entire domain.\n\n64\n00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.460\nOr I can show you where it actually\ndoes get attach to something\n\n65\n00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.890\nlike an actual OU at some point.\n\n66\n00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.460\nBut right here, we're gonna take this\nlink instead, let me scroll out here for\n\n67\n00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.016\na moment, and it says OK,\nit's actually saying, hey,\n\n68\n00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:29.421\nare you sure you wanna do this?\n\n69\n00:03:29.421 --> 00:03:31.210\nYeah, that's fine.\n\n70\n00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.100\nSo I wanna take a look inside of this\nparticular group policy object right here\n\n71\n00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.840\nIf I right click the easiest way to do\nthis is to go to where it says enforced,\n\n72\n00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.350\nor not enforced, link.\n\n73\n00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.480\nI'm reading and then I'm actually clicking\non something else, so link instead.\n\n74\n00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.170\nNow once we have, or edit,\nsee I'm even saying the wrong thing here.\n\n75\n00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.510\nOnce we do have the group policy what\nCherokee is mentioning here is that when\n\n76\n00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.440\nyou see it, remember that this is divided\nup into, well, two different sections and\n\n77\n00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.440\nthen there's two subsections underneath\neach of those two sections as well.\n\n78\n00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.720\nSo, in part one,\nwe did say you can actually see where\n\n79\n00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.177\nthere's Computer Configurations\nas well as User Configurations.\n\n80\n00:04:11.177 --> 00:04:14.898\nIf you wanted it to apply to everybody\nthat's logging in to that computer\n\n81\n00:04:14.898 --> 00:04:16.368\nregardless of who they are.\n\n82\n00:04:16.368 --> 00:04:20.262\nYou can actually say, hey,\nI don't care what group that you're in or\n\n83\n00:04:20.262 --> 00:04:25.060\nwho it is, this is going to apply to you,\nyou try to set those policies up here.\n\n84\n00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.170\nYou'll tend to have more information\nthat you'll see up here,\n\n85\n00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.550\nthan you will at the user\nconfiguration which can, of course,\n\n86\n00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.090\nbe limited to well the groups that\nyou want it to be limited to as well.\n\n87\n00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.290\nSo that's where you see that.\n\n88\n00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.520\nBut notice that underneath each of those,\n\n89\n00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.270\nyou have what Cherokee was pointing out\nat the very beginning with her question.\n\n90\n00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.500\nThere are Policies and\n\n91\n00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.940\nthere are Preferences to be had here\nwhen we start to take a look into.\n\n92\n00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.820\nSo if we want to differentiate\nbetween these two right away,\n\n93\n00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.230\nand try to make sure that we understand\nthis, when you are setting a policy,\n\n94\n00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:07.000\nyou are choosing what it is that\nyou are actually going to enforce.\n\n95\n00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.400\nNow, even then,\nwhen I use that type of language, right,\n\n96\n00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.540\nIt tends to set this idea here\nof some type of very strict and\n\n97\n00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.960\nstructured idea that you\nwant to have in place.\n\n98\n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.540\nAnd that is the goal right.\n\n99\n00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.700\nIs that what you're saying\nis here is what applies.\n\n100\n00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.155\nI don't care who it is that is logged into\nthis machine, it'a going to apply to them.\n\n101\n00:05:30.155 --> 00:05:31.830\nOkay and that's what you want.\n\n102\n00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.770\nNow a good rule of thumb as you set\ndifferent policies if I expand this out\n\n103\n00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.440\nremember that you actually have more sub\ncategories in each one of these right?\n\n104\n00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.040\nFor example if I expand out\nthe windows setting here\n\n105\n00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.230\nthere's even more that we can expand out.\n\n106\n00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.634\nAnd if I expand out Security Settings\nthere's even more and\n\n107\n00:05:48.634 --> 00:05:51.094\nit continues to dive down in through this.\n\n108\n00:05:51.094 --> 00:05:53.665\nSo whenever you're\nactually setting a policy,\n\n109\n00:05:53.665 --> 00:05:57.670\nyou got to think about what it is\nthat you're really doing, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:02.559\nEven though we're actually talking\nabout the idea of enforcement,\n\n111\n00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:06.264\nanother way to be able to\nthink about this is saying,\n\n112\n00:06:06.264 --> 00:06:09.907\nhere is what I don't want\nto be changed by someone.\n\n113\n00:06:09.907 --> 00:06:11.692\nSo let's take for an example,\n\n114\n00:06:11.692 --> 00:06:16.230\nI'm gonna use Cherokee since she's\nsitting right here as an example.\n\n115\n00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.422\nLet's say that Cherokee\ndoes have an issue of\n\n116\n00:06:19.422 --> 00:06:24.219\nwalking away from her particular computer,\nleaving it logged on.\n\n117\n00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:27.187\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's say that that happens, and\n\n118\n00:06:27.187 --> 00:06:30.390\nnot only is Cherokee actually\njust doing that for herself.\n\n119\n00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.590\nBut she's convinced everybody else in\nthe office to do it as well, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.880\nSo now as the manager walks by and\nrealizes, where are all of these,\n\n121\n00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.600\neverybody's actually out getting\nsome coffee, but you know,\n\n122\n00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.510\nat our coffee shop up here, but\neverybody's computer is logged on.\n\n123\n00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.358\nWhile if I do not want somebody to have\nthe ability to change that option, say,\n\n124\n00:06:51.358 --> 00:06:53.860\nyes, I want to be able to stay logged on.\n\n125\n00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.281\nThen this is where I would set a policy,\na policy essentially says,\n\n126\n00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:00.630\nyou're not to change this, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.770\nIt doesn't matter who you are,\nyou are not to change this,\n\n128\n00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.420\nthat's a good time to set policy.\n\n129\n00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.940\nSo when we do something like that, right?\n\n130\n00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.740\nThe neat thing is once we configure\nthe way that we want it to be\n\n131\n00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.660\nwe're saying don't change this.\n\n132\n00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.910\nWhen somebody then like Cherokee who\nhas server and knowledge experience,\n\n133\n00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.420\nright and she comes in, and she goes,\nI don't care that this is what it is.\n\n134\n00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.930\nI know exactly where I can go on\nmy local machine to change it.\n\n135\n00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.620\nGuess what Cherokee is going to find out.\n\n136\n00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.695\nCherokee you might have I'm pretty sure\npeople have actually asked you about this.\n\n137\n00:07:32.695 --> 00:07:35.402\nAnd this is where the end user\ngets a little bit confused.\n\n138\n00:07:35.402 --> 00:07:37.980\nThey're gonna say, hey, one day I\nwas able to actually go in here and\n\n139\n00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.480\nclick on this check mark.\n\n140\n00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.120\nAnd today, Cherokee,\nI go in there and that check mark,\n\n141\n00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.580\nit doesn't allow me to click it anymore,\nokay?\n\n142\n00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.460\nThat option is grayed out.\n\n143\n00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.660\nYou'll here that term a lot of times.\n\n144\n00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.716\nSo that's what you'll end up seeing, or\n\n145\n00:07:51.716 --> 00:07:54.140\nthe end user experience\nwill end up seeing that.\n\n146\n00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:59.237\nIs that the user will go these settings\nhere for my desktop or whatever it is.\n\n147\n00:07:59.237 --> 00:08:00.851\nI can't change those anymore.\n\n148\n00:08:00.851 --> 00:08:05.036\nI used to be able to do this, I used to be\nable to do that but now I can't do that.\n\n149\n00:08:05.036 --> 00:08:07.906\nWell, that's because a policy\nwas set in place and\n\n150\n00:08:07.906 --> 00:08:12.316\nremember that essentially what a policy\nreally needs is somebody else decides\n\n151\n00:08:12.316 --> 00:08:16.170\nwhat is to be in place and\nwhat it is that you cannot change.\n\n152\n00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.640\nSo that's when we actually\ndo apply policies, so\n\n153\n00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.190\nthat's a good one to make sure that we\nunderstand them that we put in place.\n\n154\n00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.160\nNow once we have that, let's go back and\n\n155\n00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.020\nwe'll now take a look,\nof course, at Preferences here\n\n156\n00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.050\nto make sure that we understand the\ndifference between these as well, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:38.650\nNow when it comes down to Preferences,\nthat's right before the show began here.\n\n158\n00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:42.080\nThe term preferences,\nwhen you start thinking about it,\n\n159\n00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:47.091\nit is natural to go okay, preference\nmeans you prefer it to be that way.\n\n160\n00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:50.789\n&gt;&gt; Or you could pick another synonym,\nwhat do you say,\n\n161\n00:08:50.789 --> 00:08:55.412\nI don't even know, but\nit's kind of obvious in that aspect, but\n\n162\n00:08:55.412 --> 00:09:00.910\nit doesn't really have a good contrast\nas to what is it not preferred over.\n\n163\n00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.260\n&gt;&gt; So, let's put it in\ncontrast with policies, right?\n\n164\n00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:03.886\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n165\n00:09:03.886 --> 00:09:08.544\nif we say that a policy is\nessentially enforced, okay?\n\n166\n00:09:08.544 --> 00:09:12.864\nAnd that's something that we don't\nwant to allow somebody to change,\n\n167\n00:09:12.864 --> 00:09:15.880\na preference though, is not enforced.\n\n168\n00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.050\nI can tell Cherokee if I say, Cherokee,\n\n169\n00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:25.340\nI would prefer that you not walk away\nfrom your computer and leave it unlocked.\n\n170\n00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.440\nThat's a preference, right?\n\n171\n00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.071\nThat's my preference that she not do that.\n\n172\n00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:34.154\nAnd I could say, Cherokee,\nI would prefer you, prefe-,\n\n173\n00:09:34.154 --> 00:09:37.731\nwhy can't I say the word prefer you\nnot to tell everybody in the office\n\n174\n00:09:37.731 --> 00:09:40.678\nto just leave your computers unlocked and\nwalked away.\n\n175\n00:09:40.678 --> 00:09:44.247\nWell, that doesnt' seem to actually\nhave the same impact, right?\n\n176\n00:09:44.247 --> 00:09:47.710\nThe same enforcement\nas what a policy does.\n\n177\n00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:52.151\nA policy just says, it's gonna happen,\nso after three minutes of inactivity,\n\n178\n00:09:52.151 --> 00:09:56.930\nas Cherokee is sitting there, her computer\nscreen locks and it frustrates her.\n\n179\n00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.069\nBut her preference is I don't like that,\nand now Cherokee just goes in there,\n\n180\n00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:01.702\nfinds where that actually screen locks.\n\n181\n00:10:01.702 --> 00:10:04.832\nAnd says, we are going to\nchange this to 10 minutes or\n\n182\n00:10:04.832 --> 00:10:09.230\n15 minutes or whatever it is before\nit actually locks again instead.\n\n183\n00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.460\nSo that is what a preferences is,\nis a kind of policy but\n\n184\n00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.090\nwe don't really enforce it in that way.\n\n185\n00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.231\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, it's fine fine that you've\nactually picked that as an example because\n\n186\n00:10:20.231 --> 00:10:24.256\nleaving those computer screens unlocked\nis actually a huge upheaval of mind, and\n\n187\n00:10:24.256 --> 00:10:26.842\nI see it happen all the time\neven in medical offices.\n\n188\n00:10:26.842 --> 00:10:31.444\nSo that's a big problem for me\npersonally if it's my, [LAUGH] Doctor or\n\n189\n00:10:31.444 --> 00:10:33.642\nmy hospital that I'm visiting, so\n\n190\n00:10:33.642 --> 00:10:38.060\nI could see how beneficial implementing\ngroup policy is in this sense.\n\n191\n00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.710\nBecause sometimes you have those\nregulatory compliancies like HIPPA to\n\n192\n00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:47.450\nfollow and you can't just prefer\nto leave and stations locked.\n\n193\n00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.050\nYou definitely need to\nenforce that policy.\n\n194\n00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.396\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthe neat thing with the preferences right,\n\n195\n00:10:52.396 --> 00:10:53.824\nis that I can set this like I said.\n\n196\n00:10:53.824 --> 00:10:54.954\nI can go all right so\n\n197\n00:10:54.954 --> 00:11:00.049\nin Cherokee's group I'm gonna set it to\nfive minutes where if there's no activity,\n\n198\n00:11:00.049 --> 00:11:04.034\nit's gonna lock the computer for\nher and it's not even to ask her.\n\n199\n00:11:04.034 --> 00:11:08.081\nBut it also gives Cherokee the ability to\ngo I don't like because there's sometimes\n\n200\n00:11:08.081 --> 00:11:11.387\nI'm just reading something on my desk and\nit takes me five minutes and\n\n201\n00:11:11.387 --> 00:11:13.444\nlook up in the computer screen's locked.\n\n202\n00:11:13.444 --> 00:11:17.734\nWell, I can give that ability for\nwhoever is sitting there, to say I prefer,\n\n203\n00:11:17.734 --> 00:11:21.634\neven though that's the preference\nis five minutes I can change that.\n\n204\n00:11:21.634 --> 00:11:22.386\n&gt;&gt; 15 minutes.\n\n205\n00:11:22.386 --> 00:11:24.170\n&gt;&gt; 15, yeah you can change it.\n\n206\n00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.775\nSo that is kinda the difference\nhere when you have that ability.\n\n207\n00:11:26.775 --> 00:11:29.990\nNow you might be saying,\nwhy would they ever give that?\n\n208\n00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:36.610\nBecause there are some things in which,\nit really is about the nature, right?\n\n209\n00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.720\nOf actually saying look,\nthis is something,\n\n210\n00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.930\nthis is really something that cannot or\nshould not ever change.\n\n211\n00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.077\nVersus this is more of a something that\nwe'd rather not change, but we understand\n\n212\n00:11:46.077 --> 00:11:49.819\nthat there are gonna be certain users\nthat have different requirements.\n\n213\n00:11:49.819 --> 00:11:53.297\nSo, let's go ahead and set it up\nthe way that we would like to, but\n\n214\n00:11:53.297 --> 00:11:56.104\nif a user chooses to change it,\nthen we'll do that.\n\n215\n00:11:56.104 --> 00:11:58.016\nSo, when you take a look\nat the policy then,\n\n216\n00:11:58.016 --> 00:12:00.410\nremember the policy's gonna\nend up applying, okay?\n\n217\n00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.120\nAnd it's gonna end up getting enforced.\n\n218\n00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.878\nNobody's gonna change it, only I or\n\n219\n00:12:04.878 --> 00:12:08.066\nwhoever's actually in charge of\ngroup policy is gonna change it.\n\n220\n00:12:08.066 --> 00:12:12.422\nPreference says, let me go ahead and set\nup all this the way that I'd like to see\n\n221\n00:12:12.422 --> 00:12:15.656\nit work, and then the individual\nusers at that computer,\n\n222\n00:12:15.656 --> 00:12:19.080\nthey can choose to change at\nthe way that they want to.\n\n223\n00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.460\nBut if they don't change, in other\nwords if they leave it at the default,\n\n224\n00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.630\nit's still gonna follow\nwhat I want it to do.\n\n225\n00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.960\nSo this way, they wont have it grayed out.\n\n226\n00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.990\nThose options will still\nbe available to them.\n\n227\n00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:34.559\nAnd that's a very important thing as we\nstart taking look at this idea of between\n\n228\n00:12:34.559 --> 00:12:36.860\npolicies and preferences okay.\n\n229\n00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.720\nSo when you look at whether you're\ntalking about user configuration or\n\n230\n00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.903\ncomputer configuration those are kind\nof big differences between policy and\n\n231\n00:12:44.903 --> 00:12:46.268\npreferences to do that.\n\n232\n00:12:46.268 --> 00:12:50.546\nNow, not every single preference you\nactually see that I've compared them It's\n\n233\n00:12:50.546 --> 00:12:52.460\ngonna have the same depth.\n\n234\n00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:57.190\nSo normally, preferences deal with\nwhat we normally see on the computer,\n\n235\n00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.890\nitself, in terms of the way\nit's displayed, and\n\n236\n00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:03.850\nsome of the settings that we see here,\nand control panel settings.\n\n237\n00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.442\nBut it doesn't go into like\nsecurity settings, right,\n\n238\n00:13:06.442 --> 00:13:08.010\nwhich they probably shouldn't.\n\n239\n00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:12.527\nSo that's why we want to make sure that\nwe do have this understanding in hand\n\n240\n00:13:12.527 --> 00:13:15.050\nbetween those differences, all right.\n\n241\n00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:15.837\nSo that's enough of that.\n\n242\n00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:19.360\nWhen we start to take a look at\nthe differences between those.\n\n243\n00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.518\nNow of course like anything else,\nit's time for\n\n244\n00:13:22.518 --> 00:13:26.350\nus to take a look at creating\nsome policies as well.\n\n245\n00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:27.934\nNow in an earlier episode, right?\n\n246\n00:13:27.934 --> 00:13:29.830\nIn the part one of this episode.\n\n247\n00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.231\nLet me close out of this policy here.\n\n248\n00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:36.858\nIn an earlier episode I did create\na group policy object right here\n\n249\n00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.220\ninside of group policy objects.\n\n250\n00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:45.718\nI called it the Default Office 365 Policy\nand the Publicity Password Policy here.\n\n251\n00:13:45.718 --> 00:13:50.564\nThose were the ones I created right here,\nbut if I wanted to remember that\n\n252\n00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:55.412\nyou can do this with a,\n&gt;&gt; PowerShell commandlet?\n\n253\n00:13:55.412 --> 00:13:57.967\n&gt;&gt; Yeah PowerShell commandlet as well, and\n\n254\n00:13:57.967 --> 00:14:02.420\nI believe I did create one of these\nwith a PowerShell commandlet as well.\n\n255\n00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.433\nSo just remember that\nwhen you do create that,\n\n256\n00:14:05.433 --> 00:14:10.660\nyou're not exactly making it apply\nto anything directly right away.\n\n257\n00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.750\nBut then you can link these.\n\n258\n00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.620\nNow at some point I'd asked\nyou to link this, and so\n\n259\n00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.900\nyou can also see right here where I'd\nactually ended up linking it as well, and\n\n260\n00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.300\nthere were a couple of\nways where we can do this.\n\n261\n00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.430\nInside of the actual OU, so\nthis is just a reminder here.\n\n262\n00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.690\nIf I wanted to I can,\nlet's say Office 365 up here.\n\n263\n00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:35.244\nIf I right click on it, notice that I\nhave the ability to link an existing GPO,\n\n264\n00:14:35.244 --> 00:14:40.115\nand if I select this it is in here\nwere I can look inside this domain and\n\n265\n00:14:40.115 --> 00:14:43.850\nnow I can choose the one\nthat I choose to link.\n\n266\n00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:50.270\nSo I can just select this one, the office\npolicy here and then click OK and\n\n267\n00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:55.560\nwhen I do that, notice it actually\nattached it with that little arrow.\n\n268\n00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.680\nSo that's kinda the second time we've\nactually done that and we've seen this.\n\n269\n00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.987\nBut overall though, just make sure\nthat when you do something like this,\n\n270\n00:15:02.987 --> 00:15:04.936\nit really is going to be helpful.\n\n271\n00:15:04.936 --> 00:15:09.398\nNow there's always this idea that's a good\nemphasis for us and for me to make even in\n\n272\n00:15:09.398 --> 00:15:13.860\nthis episode, even though you probably\njust saw this in part one as well.\n\n273\n00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.711\nIs, is there really a benefit to doing\ngroup policy object inside of PowerShell?\n\n274\n00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:23.040\nI hate to say this, this is one of\nthose instances where it's really not.\n\n275\n00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.189\nAnd the reason why is that even\nthough PowerShell helps us and\n\n276\n00:15:26.189 --> 00:15:29.030\nwe've seen it throughout this\nentire series so far and\n\n277\n00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.760\nwe'll see it much more as\nwe continue through this.\n\n278\n00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.140\nIt helps us out when we have a lot of\nrepetitive tasks, bulk items to do,\n\n279\n00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.374\nmost of us are not gonna be creating\nthat many policies where creating\n\n280\n00:15:40.374 --> 00:15:44.830\na PowerShell is really gonna be\nthat much more of an efficiency.\n\n281\n00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:49.287\nBut if you want to learn and you wanna\nmake sure that you master PowerShell,\n\n282\n00:15:49.287 --> 00:15:53.270\ncreating more PowerShell group\npolicies are actually possible.\n\n283\n00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:57.962\nSo that way you can actually start doing\nthat as far as practicing making sure that\n\n284\n00:15:57.962 --> 00:16:02.309\nyou get it on hand, but most of us are\nprobably not gonna see a super gigantic\n\n285\n00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:06.794\nbenefit Because we're probably not\ngonna have hundreds of group policies,\n\n286\n00:16:06.794 --> 00:16:09.700\nmaybe in a very big\norganization you might.\n\n287\n00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.050\nBut most of us are probably\ngonna have as few as we can\n\n288\n00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:16.790\nto get done the things that we want to\nbecause we don't really want to manage\n\n289\n00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.750\nall these different settings\na lot of the times too.\n\n290\n00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:19.930\n&gt;&gt; Well, it really makes sense, Ronnie.\n\n291\n00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.780\nIf you think about it, Group Policies and\nActive Directory have predated PowerShell.\n\n292\n00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.470\nSo they've been developing those\ntechnologies and those concepts for\n\n293\n00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.380\nquite a while now so as to make them\nas fluid and efficient as possible.\n\n294\n00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now along with that, the other\nissues that we have when we start having\n\n295\n00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.860\nmultiple policies out there, okay?\n\n296\n00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.800\nIs that we might find that we end up\ndoing something that we don't want to do.\n\n297\n00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.230\nLet me kind of give you an example.\n\n298\n00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.710\nSo let's take a look at our\nscreen right here, okay?\n\n299\n00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.420\nSo just for a moment.\n\n300\n00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:52.870\nNow Cherokee, at this point,\nlet me just kind of go down here and\n\n301\n00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.740\njust try to show a couple of things.\n\n302\n00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.110\nRight here, at the very top\nunderneath Office Pro here,\n\n303\n00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.670\nI have a default domain policy, right?\n\n304\n00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:05.650\nAnd if I keep clicking on it,\nit's gonna get me every time.\n\n305\n00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:06.555\nSo I have that.\n\n306\n00:17:06.555 --> 00:17:11.133\nNow when I actually put that there,\nI've gotta remember something,\n\n307\n00:17:11.133 --> 00:17:15.866\nthat it also applies to every object\nthat actually follows underneath as\n\n308\n00:17:15.866 --> 00:17:18.832\na subcategory underneath my domain, okay?\n\n309\n00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:24.760\nSo in other words, not only does default\ndomain policy apply to the entire\n\n310\n00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.140\ndomain in this level,\nit also applies down here to Office 365,\n\n311\n00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.470\neven inside of these\ncontainers down here as well.\n\n312\n00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.130\nNow, when this comes\ndown to even publicity,\n\n313\n00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:40.440\nthe one that I also attached\nthis object to, this GPO to,\n\n314\n00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.560\nnotice that there's also\na Default Office Policy as well.\n\n315\n00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.830\nAnd that means that Publicity here\nactually has influences of, well,\n\n316\n00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:53.670\nPublicity Password Policy, which again,\nI should click on that Do Not Show, but\n\n317\n00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:54.990\nI'm gonna leave it as.\n\n318\n00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:59.790\nThe Default Domain Policy as well as\nthe Default Domain Policy up here and\n\n319\n00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:00.740\nthe Default Office365.\n\n320\n00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:06.630\nSo we are now getting into\nthe area that we call inheritance.\n\n321\n00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.530\nNow let me go and\nshow you what I'm talking about here\n\n322\n00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:13.590\nwhen it comes down to inheritance,\nas well.\n\n323\n00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:16.300\nLet me use this one, I couldn't remember\nwhich one I actually had it on.\n\n324\n00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:21.130\nAll right, now the way that the policies\nactually end up getting applied,\n\n325\n00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:24.990\nit really is depending on the order\nthat they're actually applied in.\n\n326\n00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:29.960\nSo I kind of listed this in a staircase\norder for us to understand here.\n\n327\n00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.310\nI don't know it made sense to my head,\n\n328\n00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.270\nI don't know if it makes\nsense to anybody else.\n\n329\n00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:38.020\nBut, normally,\nif you apply a policy at the site,\n\n330\n00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.350\nit really only affects the site itself.\n\n331\n00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.850\nIt does not tend to affect the domain.\n\n332\n00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.040\nIt actually affects the site here.\n\n333\n00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:50.555\nOkay, now when you actually do that,\nthat's perfectly fine and that make sense.\n\n334\n00:18:50.555 --> 00:18:53.270\nBut that's just about it.\n\n335\n00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:56.050\nNow everything else, thought,\nthat you actually have,\n\n336\n00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:57.350\nthis is what ends up happening.\n\n337\n00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.640\nSo the site is actually applied first.\n\n338\n00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.250\nNow if you end up getting another\npolicy and you apply it, let's say,\n\n339\n00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.870\nright here and those are actually\nhaving the same settings.\n\n340\n00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:11.010\nWell, it's actually gonna be\nthe last one that applies\n\n341\n00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.860\nthat gets it to come down through here.\n\n342\n00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.230\nSo this one will actually override it.\n\n343\n00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:20.040\nThis one will override whatever\nwas applied to the domain as well.\n\n344\n00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.220\nAnd then if you have something\non the child domain,\n\n345\n00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.940\nthat will also end up working as well.\n\n346\n00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.420\nSo it's which ever one is the last\napplied when we start seeing that.\n\n347\n00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.852\nI think I just misnamed these,\nthat's what I did.\n\n348\n00:19:31.852 --> 00:19:34.812\nSo here's the way that we see it inside of\n\n349\n00:19:34.812 --> 00:19:38.307\nthe Group Policy Management\nconsole instead.\n\n350\n00:19:38.307 --> 00:19:43.800\nSo here I have the domain up here and\nthen I have one right here.\n\n351\n00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.800\nAnd I had one right here.\n\n352\n00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:51.180\nSo everything that's up here in the GPO,\nat the top\n\n353\n00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:56.270\nhere, it actually flows down, which of\ncourse it didn't come out with an arrow.\n\n354\n00:19:56.270 --> 00:20:00.450\nOf all the times I thought it would\ndefault with an arrow, it actually applies\n\n355\n00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:05.870\nin this fashion all the way\ndown through here, okay?\n\n356\n00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:10.973\nAnd then of course,\nthat means, That this one\n\n357\n00:20:10.973 --> 00:20:16.170\nwould also continue to apply all\nthe way down through here as well.\n\n358\n00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.620\nAnd then the one on the Child OU,\n\n359\n00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:23.690\nwhich is right here, that would of course\napply inside the Child OU as well, okay?\n\n360\n00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.230\nSo we normally do have this\nwhere we have this inheritance.\n\n361\n00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.990\nNow the problem is fairly easy here.\n\n362\n00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:33.980\nIf these settings that we have\nare actually contradictory and\n\n363\n00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.070\noverriding, well, which ones actually\nget applied in the very end?\n\n364\n00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.770\nAnd what ends up happening?\n\n365\n00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.440\nAnd that's the key, right?\n\n366\n00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.900\nIs that you may have where you've\napplied something up here, but\n\n367\n00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.600\nyou don't want it to apply down\nhere in the Child OU, okay?\n\n368\n00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.280\nBut it's still applying.\n\n369\n00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:54.150\nSo what can we do to actually change\nthat is what we wanna talk about.\n\n370\n00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:57.350\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie,\nI see a lot of similarities here between\n\n371\n00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.040\nthis organizational unit architecture.\n\n372\n00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.970\nAnd it looks a lot like our directory\nwithin the operating system,\n\n373\n00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.090\nour file system directory there.\n\n374\n00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.300\nAnd I know that with my files and\n\n375\n00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:13.305\nmy folders, with that hierarchical system,\nand we're talking permissions.\n\n376\n00:21:13.305 --> 00:21:16.965\nI see something very similar happening,\nbecause if I applied permissions to\n\n377\n00:21:16.965 --> 00:21:20.635\na parent folder,\nI'll have inheritance there as well and\n\n378\n00:21:20.635 --> 00:21:25.265\nthey will propagate down to my\nchild objects and my leaf objects.\n\n379\n00:21:25.265 --> 00:21:30.195\nSo I know that with that system,\nI can go ahead and block inheritance.\n\n380\n00:21:30.195 --> 00:21:32.230\nIs that something that we\ncould do here as well?\n\n381\n00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.840\n&gt;&gt; There is, there is something that you\ncan actually make sure that you do to\n\n382\n00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.890\nensure that you can block\ninheritance as well.\n\n383\n00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.390\nAnd when you do something like this,\nit's just saying, hey,\n\n384\n00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:45.450\nlook, don't allow this to trickle down\nin the way that we showed you, in which,\n\n385\n00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:49.580\nwhatever the top level is, it actually\napplies all the way down through here.\n\n386\n00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.760\nNow if we wanna make sure it applies,\nthere's actually an easy way to do it.\n\n387\n00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:59.050\nSo let's take, for an example,\nright here at the default domain policy.\n\n388\n00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:03.960\nIf I right click on this, there's\nactually this, that says Enforced, okay?\n\n389\n00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.290\nEnforced pretty much says,\nmake sure it applies, okay?\n\n390\n00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:10.910\nAnd what happens then, as it's actually\nenforced at whatever level it is,\n\n391\n00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:14.940\ndown here it also makes sure\nit puts it at the top priority\n\n392\n00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:18.700\nof the list as well in terms of these\nlink orders that you end up seeing.\n\n393\n00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.890\nSo you'll end up seeing that object go on.\n\n394\n00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:27.122\nSo for here, let me see where is the,\nlet me go back.\n\n395\n00:22:27.122 --> 00:22:29.224\nSo you actually end up seeing that.\n\n396\n00:22:29.224 --> 00:22:31.418\nSo if you actually enforce\nsomething like that,\n\n397\n00:22:31.418 --> 00:22:33.485\nthat's exactly what will end up happening.\n\n398\n00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:36.350\nIs to actually make sure it\ngets the highest priority\n\n399\n00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:40.120\nin whatever child OU it\nalso filters down into.\n\n400\n00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.270\nAt this point, you can.\n\n401\n00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:47.310\nThere is a way for\nyou to instead be able to block\n\n402\n00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:53.440\nthe inheritance as well as,\nas you start to take a look at doing this.\n\n403\n00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.866\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie,\nthis also I've heard the term RSOP.\n\n404\n00:22:55.866 --> 00:22:59.929\nSo would that apple here for\nResultant Set of Policy?\n\n405\n00:22:59.929 --> 00:23:04.335\n&gt;&gt; Well, that normally applies to\neither the usually the user, right?\n\n406\n00:23:04.335 --> 00:23:06.883\nWhatever actually comes\ndown to that user object.\n\n407\n00:23:06.883 --> 00:23:10.675\nAnd you wanna see if everything's actually\napplied the way that you want to.\n\n408\n00:23:10.675 --> 00:23:14.255\nSo in that instance when you\nstart to take the look at that.\n\n409\n00:23:14.255 --> 00:23:18.590\nThe user, you can run a command and\nactually see, did that policy actually end\n\n410\n00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:22.992\nup applying to that one user account to\nmake sure that that ends up happening, or\n\n411\n00:23:22.992 --> 00:23:24.917\nto that computer account as well.\n\n412\n00:23:24.917 --> 00:23:28.761\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Ronnie, so we do have that\ncapability, but where can we go ahead and\n\n413\n00:23:28.761 --> 00:23:29.928\nforce that blocking?\n\n414\n00:23:29.928 --> 00:23:34.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, whenever we start seeing this,\nit's not exactly as easy as it seems.\n\n415\n00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.929\nSo I've been kinda hunting around, but let\nme show you again where we would normally\n\n416\n00:23:38.929 --> 00:23:41.260\ndo this idea of blocking inheritance.\n\n417\n00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.970\nSo on my screen, you would think\nit's easy, I just right click, and\n\n418\n00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:50.130\nthere should be a check mark here that\nsays block inheritance or something.\n\n419\n00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:51.430\nBut it's not that easy.\n\n420\n00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:55.210\nA lot of times, for us, this is where\nit gets a little bit trickier, right?\n\n421\n00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:59.312\nIf I wanna block inheritance,\nI'm going to double click on the domain.\n\n422\n00:23:59.312 --> 00:24:03.064\nAnd once I do that,\nnotice that there are these four tabs, and\n\n423\n00:24:03.064 --> 00:24:05.456\nthere it is Group Policy Inheritance.\n\n424\n00:24:05.456 --> 00:24:06.789\nIs right here.\n\n425\n00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:08.671\nSo, when I see something like this,\n\n426\n00:24:08.671 --> 00:24:11.820\nI can see that the inheritance's\nstatus is enabled.\n\n427\n00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.450\nList does not include any\nGPOs linked to sites,\n\n428\n00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:16.740\nbecause sites is actually different here.\n\n429\n00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.890\nThen, if I right-click,\n\n430\n00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:23.050\nnow notice that you have well,\nthis where it says Block Inheritance.\n\n431\n00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:27.970\nSo this is where you have that ability to\nsay I really didn't want this particular\n\n432\n00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:32.220\npolicy to go ahead and actually\nhave that inheritance trickle down\n\n433\n00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.520\ninto those other containers\nthat we have available.\n\n434\n00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.820\nSo it is something that you\nmay have to do to do this.\n\n435\n00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.860\nBut a lot of times, right, blocking\ninheritance, this is kinda one of those\n\n436\n00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.640\ntricky things that can-\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna go overboard.\n\n437\n00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you don't wanna go overboard\nbecause you could actually end up blocking\n\n438\n00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:54.230\nsomething that you really did need,\nthe policy to apply in.\n\n439\n00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:58.440\nSo don't just say hey,\nI'm gonna block everything and\n\n440\n00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.780\nthen you have to actually\nrecreate everything again.\n\n441\n00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.320\nSo, take a little bit of time.\n\n442\n00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.895\nMost of the time what you're worried\nabout, right, is not so much that\n\n443\n00:25:07.895 --> 00:25:13.560\nWindows setting is actually blocked.\n\n444\n00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.650\nLike changing your desktop or\nanything like that, or your background.\n\n445\n00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:22.070\nBut it's when you end up blocking like\nsecurity settings at a higher level\n\n446\n00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.580\nthat should trickle all the way down,\nthat’s when you actually have more issues.\n\n447\n00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:26.460\nBut the majority of us,\n\n448\n00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.880\nlike I said, we’re probably not gonna get\ninto it that deep, but we did wanna make\n\n449\n00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.750\nsure that we showed you that you could\nactually block inheritance, okay?\n\n450\n00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:36.040\nSo there’s a lot of complexity\nthat’s actually behind\n\n451\n00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.030\nthe group policies that we have here.\n\n452\n00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:40.580\nSo you actually have to think\nabout this idea of links and\n\n453\n00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.620\nall the orders that you\nhave to worry about.\n\n454\n00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.990\nSo let's make sure that\nwe understand that.\n\n455\n00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:46.710\n&gt;&gt; So with these complexities Ronnie,\n\n456\n00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:50.760\nwhat should I check to make sure that\nthey are or are not being enforced?\n\n457\n00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.060\n&gt;&gt; Well this is where we do\nhave take a little bit of time.\n\n458\n00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.110\nWe're not gonna spend\na ton of time on this.\n\n459\n00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:59.300\nWe're pretty much gonna go over\nthe very basic things here, okay.\n\n460\n00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:04.330\nOne of the things that you wanna check\nright away is that you wanna make sure\n\n461\n00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:11.360\nthat the computers that you believe these\ngroup policy objects are gonna apply to.\n\n462\n00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.380\nThey're actually in the OU\nthat you want them to be in.\n\n463\n00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.530\nNow, remember that that that's actually\ngonna include you not only looking,\n\n464\n00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.080\nwell, let's look at my computer here,\nokay.\n\n465\n00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.350\nNot only looking right there but\n\n466\n00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:26.540\nthat's gonna get you to go into either the\nactive directory administrative center or\n\n467\n00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.220\ngoing to your active directory users and\ncomputers and verify.\n\n468\n00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.530\nThat those computers you think\napply are actually in that OU.\n\n469\n00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:37.050\nThe majority of times on\nthe mistakes that I've made,\n\n470\n00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:40.520\nit's because I've actually applied that\nOU because logically I'm saying yeah,\n\n471\n00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.420\nthat computer should be in there.\n\n472\n00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:48.130\nBut then I realize for example like with\nWDS, somebody reimaged that computer.\n\n473\n00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:51.440\nBut at the same time,\nthat name for one reason or\n\n474\n00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.380\nanother wasn't actually in that OU.\n\n475\n00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.710\nIt ended up getting created in\nthe computer's container instead.\n\n476\n00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:00.170\nAnd now that's why\nthe object's not applying.\n\n477\n00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:03.180\nSo make sure you are actually\nable to do that.\n\n478\n00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:03.810\nOkay.\n\n479\n00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:10.320\nWhenever you actually end up\ngetting multiple objects, right?\n\n480\n00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:16.060\nOr multiple OUs, not OUs,\ngroup policy objects applied to an OU?\n\n481\n00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.890\nNow that's when it gets a little\nbit more confusing, right?\n\n482\n00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:22.060\nBecause now,\nhow do you know which one applies?\n\n483\n00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.800\nWhat if they both actually have\ndifferent settings for let's say,\n\n484\n00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.800\nthe password policy, okay?\n\n485\n00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.930\nSo you have two different ones\nthat are actually set there.\n\n486\n00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:34.120\nAre two different group policy objects but\nthey're now applied to one OU but\n\n487\n00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.440\nthey have different settings and\ngroup policy.\n\n488\n00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:40.280\nWell when you have something like that,\nright, you have to remember that\n\n489\n00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.905\nwhat's gonna happen is that they're\ngonna be processed in a specific order.\n\n490\n00:27:43.905 --> 00:27:47.375\nAnd that's where if you, let's take\na look at this for an example here.\n\n491\n00:27:47.375 --> 00:27:49.185\nLinked group policy objects.\n\n492\n00:27:49.185 --> 00:27:55.385\nThe link order will make a difference when\nmultiple group policy objects are applied.\n\n493\n00:27:55.385 --> 00:27:59.325\nAnd usually the lowest number is\nactually the one that tends to apply.\n\n494\n00:27:59.325 --> 00:28:02.771\nSo as you add them in, notice that it give\nyou these arrows that you can kind of\n\n495\n00:28:02.771 --> 00:28:05.205\nreorder them\n&gt;&gt; Set the priority\n\n496\n00:28:05.205 --> 00:28:06.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, to make sure so\n\n497\n00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:08.530\nthat way if you go this one\nis suppose to apply and\n\n498\n00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.630\nnot this one but\nall the policy objects have to be there.\n\n499\n00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:14.180\nThis is where you set that order\nespecially when something like that\n\n500\n00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.900\ndoesn't apply as well.\n\n501\n00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.960\nLink orders normally do handle\nsomething like this, right, and\n\n502\n00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.800\nthis is where we start\nto understand that for\n\n503\n00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.560\nus the last one that also applies\nis the one that ends up winning.\n\n504\n00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:31.370\nSo that's why we also wanna keep\nin mind a particular order here.\n\n505\n00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:36.270\nThat when you have the local policy,\nthat's always gonna be applied first.\n\n506\n00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:41.470\nThen if that particular computer is\npart of a site in active directory,\n\n507\n00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:45.410\nthe site is actually gonna get applied\nif there's a group policy object applied\n\n508\n00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:46.870\nto a particular site.\n\n509\n00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:48.330\nIt is now inside of a domain.\n\n510\n00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:50.200\nThe third one then is applied.\n\n511\n00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:50.860\nOkay?\n\n512\n00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:55.120\nAnd then you have from that point,\nparent OUs and child OUs as well.\n\n513\n00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.250\nThose are gonna be applied in that order.\n\n514\n00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:02.480\nSo, whichever one that's last applied, so\nlike a child OU actually won't be applied\n\n515\n00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.280\nlast and that's the one that's gonna win\nour, if there's any contradictions or\n\n516\n00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.090\nanything that's not complimentary\nin those other OUs.\n\n517\n00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:14.000\nBut you're actually going to end up\nseeing that that's kind of the key to us\n\n518\n00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.480\nunderstanding the way that this happens.\n\n519\n00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:21.120\nSo if you do see multiple OUs if you have\nthe ability to, I would create a test OU\n\n520\n00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:26.600\nfirst, link those same objects there,\nand then start removing one of them,\n\n521\n00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.960\nyou know moving those orders around so\nthat you can see what's going to happen.\n\n522\n00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.430\nNow, in a production environment,\nyou may not have that ability to do so,\n\n523\n00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:34.500\nbut, if you do that's what I'd do.\n\n524\n00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.080\nI'd create a test OU and\n\n525\n00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.500\nthen make sure that all those group\npolicy objects also apply there.\n\n526\n00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.960\nThat way, you can test it out and\nsee without effecting production too.\n\n527\n00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.600\nAlso, you gotta check the settings, right?\n\n528\n00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.150\nRemember we talked about this in part one,\nthat sometimes you won't get this weird\n\n529\n00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:55.090\nthing that says to disable this,\nyou have to enable it.\n\n530\n00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:56.900\nThat sounds silly to us but\n\n531\n00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.810\nthen what happens when you\ndisable a disabled setting?\n\n532\n00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:01.920\nWhat happens if you're not configuring-\n&gt;&gt; It's enabled.\n\n533\n00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, is it now enabled?\n\n534\n00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:05.070\nWhatever it might be.\n\n535\n00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:07.820\nSo make sure go through\nthe logic of those settings.\n\n536\n00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.260\nMake sure they also apply as well, okay?\n\n537\n00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:15.060\nNow ideally if you can,\nyou wanna minimize the need for\n\n538\n00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.630\ninheritance blocking if you can.\n\n539\n00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:21.260\nNow, most of us, we're not gonna be able\nto do anything about that at all, okay?\n\n540\n00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.390\nThe reason why is, if we're coming in\nnow as a server administrator, and\n\n541\n00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:28.700\neven a junior administrator,\nthose group policy objects are in there.\n\n542\n00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:32.470\nYou shouldn't mess with them unless\nsomebody sends you to mess with them.\n\n543\n00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:37.150\nBut if our starting brand new I would\ntry and not actually do a lot of\n\n544\n00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:41.430\nparent OUs at all as far as\nactually applying objects to them.\n\n545\n00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.420\nI would actually create a parent OU.\n\n546\n00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:48.260\nLet's say for all of my servers that are\nout there but then I would create a child\n\n547\n00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:53.730\nOU for\nservers in the east wing of the building.\n\n548\n00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:57.240\nServers in the west wing, whatever it\nmight be, and then apply them down there\n\n549\n00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.910\nwithout ever applying a group policy\nobject to the parent OU at all.\n\n550\n00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.860\nAnd that way you're minimizing\nthe need to figure out whether or\n\n551\n00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.970\nnot does inheritance need to be blocked or\nnot.\n\n552\n00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:10.180\nAnd it actually make things work\na lot smoother in that way.\n\n553\n00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.340\nSo everything that I've told you, right?\n\n554\n00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.600\nAnd actually when you go even beyond this.\n\n555\n00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:20.220\nYou'll also find in\nBrian Svidergol's book as well.\n\n556\n00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.650\nSo just kinda make sure that as you\ntake a look at this, it is complex.\n\n557\n00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:27.300\nDon't let this kinda throw you off, right?\n\n558\n00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:31.620\nContinue to study and once you actually do\nthat it will actually help you out as you\n\n559\n00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:35.560\ngo towards your MCSA, you will be\nable to conquer this a lot better.\n\n560\n00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.450\nSo hopefully this show will\nbe kind of a nice little\n\n561\n00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:41.380\nintroduction to the group\npolicy you can see later on.\n\n562\n00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:44.480\n&gt;&gt; I think I has been so far Ronnie and\nyou really have given some great\n\n563\n00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:48.780\nadvice especially when looking at that\napproach from the complexity level.\n\n564\n00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.060\nBecause the more convoluted,\n\n565\n00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:53.530\nthe more complexity levels of\ncomplexity that you're going to add,\n\n566\n00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:56.940\nit's almost like you're adding more\nlevels of headache pain there.\n\n567\n00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.230\n&gt;&gt; You are.\n&gt;&gt; So you kind\n\n568\n00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:02.830\nof wanna go with the old adage,\nthe kiss theory to make it logical and\n\n569\n00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:06.500\njust stick with common sense and\nI think that's a great place for\n\n570\n00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.540\nus to go ahead and begin but I have\na feeling we have a lot more to cover when\n\n571\n00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.750\nwe're talking about group policy For\nthis show, we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n572\n00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:14.580\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n573\n00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.378\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n574\n00:32:15.378 --> 00:32:18.742\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT Pro TV.\n\n575\n00:32:18.742 -->

00:00:11.265\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:14.370\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your server 101 series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.730\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.571\nIn this episode we'll continue to speak\nabout group policy but specifically we'll\n\n7\n00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:26.014\nlook at how we can actually secure\nWindows server by utilizing group policy.\n\n8\n00:00:26.014 --> 00:00:30.338\nAnd back in studio with us today Mr.\nRonnie Wong, how is it going Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:30.338 --> 00:00:34.138\n&gt;&gt; Its going a better again as\nthings are actually, you know,\n\n10\n00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:38.444\ntaking look here at group policy and\nI'm healing which is good.\n\n11\n00:00:38.444 --> 00:00:40.365\nIt.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so in case you're wondering, so\n\n12\n00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:41.880\nRonnie actually had an injury.\n\n13\n00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.300\nAnd that's why we're\nsitting in these chairs.\n\n14\n00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.106\nAnd I think it's so cool.\n\n15\n00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:46.825\nI feel like, you know, Chloe, what is it,\n\n16\n00:00:46.825 --> 00:00:50.218\nCocktails with Chloe,\none of the Kardashians there.\n\n17\n00:00:50.218 --> 00:00:52.345\nBut you know,\nwe don't have cocktails, Ronnie.\n\n18\n00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:54.509\n&gt;&gt; I don't even know\nwhat a Chloe cocktail is.\n\n19\n00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:57.115\nSo that's actually more or\nless sense than we have.\n\n20\n00:00:57.115 --> 00:01:02.935\n&gt;&gt; But we do have computer\nsecurity to talk about it.\n\n21\n00:01:02.935 --> 00:01:07.972\nAnd we also wanted to look at when we\ntake a look at our security policy,\n\n22\n00:01:07.972 --> 00:01:08.552\nwhat is that mean?\n\n23\n00:01:08.552 --> 00:01:13.612\nI heard you say in the previous episode\nin our intro to group policy that\n\n24\n00:01:13.612 --> 00:01:16.012\nwe can go ahead and\nlook at those security policies.\n\n25\n00:01:16.012 --> 00:01:17.902\nBut can you explain\nthat a little bit more?\n\n26\n00:01:17.902 --> 00:01:19.362\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when it comes down to it, right?\n\n27\n00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:22.512\nGroup policy can help us to\ndo a lot of things, right?\n\n28\n00:01:22.512 --> 00:01:24.666\nIt can control our environment for us.\n\n29\n00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:29.383\nIn terms of the way that a computer looks\nto the individual user we can set some\n\n30\n00:01:29.383 --> 00:01:34.028\nlimitations on the user making sure that\nthey you know help us out you know in\n\n31\n00:01:34.028 --> 00:01:35.820\nlogging in to the computer.\n\n32\n00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.162\nOr making sure that that\ncomputer is logged out or\n\n33\n00:01:39.162 --> 00:01:45.250\nlocked if they leave the actual computer\nleft unattended for a little bit of time.\n\n34\n00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.340\nBut when it comes down to it there\nare specific security settings, and\n\n35\n00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.190\nsome of these we've already talked about.\n\n36\n00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.840\nBut we need to take a look it a little\nbit more in depth as we start\n\n37\n00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.110\nto begin to understand the scope of the\nsecurity settings that are actually inside\n\n38\n00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.530\nthat we can control through\nusing group policy.\n\n39\n00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.770\nAnd when it first begins and\nwe start seeing it, essentially for\n\n40\n00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.870\nus anything that we can use to help\nincrease the level of security for\n\n41\n00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.230\nour domain-joined computers,\nthat's going to be key.\n\n42\n00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.460\nIn this day and age where we have to worry\nabout so many outside influences and\n\n43\n00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.080\nso many different forms of\nattacks that are out there.\n\n44\n00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.552\nTrying to say that we're too secure,\nit can happen, don't get me wrong.\n\n45\n00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:31.720\nIf we violate that CIA triangle.\n\n46\n00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.520\nBut the more security that we have and\n\n47\n00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.220\nthat we can also follow those principles,\nthe better we are going to be.\n\n48\n00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.070\nSo the great thing is,\nWindows server itself, right, there\n\n49\n00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.210\nare tons of different security policies we\ndon't have time to go through all of them.\n\n50\n00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.830\nBut we do have time to make sure,\nthat we cover a few of them right.\n\n51\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.880\nThe most basic, that apply to just about\nany organization that's out there.\n\n52\n00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.990\nAnd that's what we want to at\nleast take a look at as we begin.\n\n53\n00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.530\nSo, probably one of the most\nimportant policies,\n\n54\n00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.650\nand actually a good one for\nbeginners, right?\n\n55\n00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.210\nSo for people like you and me as we start\nthe server 101 course it is good for\n\n56\n00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.990\nus to understand.\n\n57\n00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.244\nWe want to take a look at especially\nboth of those settings and what we call\n\n58\n00:03:17.244 --> 00:03:21.808\npassword account or password policies\nas well as account lock out policies.\n\n59\n00:03:21.808 --> 00:03:25.385\nSo, we are going to spend the majority\nof our time there and then we are also\n\n60\n00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:29.180\ngoing to take a look at what we call\nfine grained password policies.\n\n61\n00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.290\nWhich are not technically a group policy\nsetting but it is something that we can\n\n62\n00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.728\nadd into the same vein of things\nthat we wanna be able to do as well.\n\n63\n00:03:36.728 --> 00:03:40.844\nAnd this is something you're\nprobably end up seeing more and\n\n64\n00:03:40.844 --> 00:03:45.523\nmore in the future as the group policy\nsettings themselves you can see\n\n65\n00:03:45.523 --> 00:03:49.630\nare kind of a very categorical\ntools that help us out.\n\n66\n00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.710\nBut they may not apply in the manner and\n\n67\n00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.361\nin the situation that we tend them\nwant to try and massage them for.\n\n68\n00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:59.608\nWhere as the fine grain policies will\nkind of help us out a little bit more so\n\n69\n00:03:59.608 --> 00:04:01.760\nwe'll end up seeing that too.\n\n70\n00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.080\nSo let's take a look at my\ncomputer as we start to see here.\n\n71\n00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.856\nAnd we go through.\n\n72\n00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:10.781\nAll we have to do,\nwe can do this in a couple of ways,\n\n73\n00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:13.180\ndepending on what you need to do.\n\n74\n00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.361\nSo there are a lot of organizations that\nsimply take the Default Domain Policy and\n\n75\n00:04:17.361 --> 00:04:20.880\nespecially on something like\npassword that applies to everybody.\n\n76\n00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.966\nThey modify the policy right here, and\nthis is something you can do as well.\n\n77\n00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:27.970\n&gt;&gt; Just using it as a template or\nboilerplate type policy?\n\n78\n00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.274\n&gt;&gt; Right, and there are, of course, you're\ngonna see some organizations that say no,\n\n79\n00:04:33.274 --> 00:04:36.196\nnever touch the actual\ndefault domain policy.\n\n80\n00:04:36.196 --> 00:04:38.040\nSo leave that one alone.\n\n81\n00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.570\nJust don't touch it all.\n\n82\n00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.800\nSo depending on whatever your organization\ndoes, that's the one you end up following.\n\n83\n00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.416\nSo for us if we do this,\n\n84\n00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:50.370\nI'm gonna right click on the default\ndomain policy and select edit.\n\n85\n00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.370\nAnd then we are going to focus in on the\npassword policy is what we're gonna do.\n\n86\n00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.610\nLet me full screen that and\nthen I can zoom in.\n\n87\n00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.300\nA little bit better here.\n\n88\n00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.550\nNow, I'm gonna go to the Computer\nConfiguration because I really wanted\n\n89\n00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.440\nto apply to domain joined computers\nregardless of who logs in.\n\n90\n00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.060\nSo I'm not gonna worry about it down here.\n\n91\n00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.710\nI'm going to select Policies, and\n\n92\n00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.490\nthen within Policies here I'm\ngonna expand out Windows Settings.\n\n93\n00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.870\nAnd I'll start to zoom in a little\nbit more so that we can see it.\n\n94\n00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.350\nSo I expand out Computers, Policies,\nand now Windows Settings, and\n\n95\n00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.420\nthen notice as we look down\nthrough here Security Settings.\n\n96\n00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.320\nWe'll look at this as we\ncontinue to drill down through.\n\n97\n00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.870\nWe are going to see a lot\nof different policies.\n\n98\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.506\nWe're gonna be spending more time,\nespecially in this episode and\n\n99\n00:05:38.506 --> 00:05:40.754\nmaybe this episode and another episode.\n\n100\n00:05:40.754 --> 00:05:44.490\nRight here underneath these security\npolicies to make sure that we see what we\n\n101\n00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.840\nneed to see here.\n\n102\n00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.220\nSo the first ones that we want to\ndo is actually take a look under\n\n103\n00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.500\nthe Account Policies, and\nI expand that one out.\n\n104\n00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.300\nIt's really these first two that we\nwant to make sure that we understand.\n\n105\n00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.820\nPassword policy and the account\nlockout policy, these are by far\n\n106\n00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.900\nsome of the most common settings that we\nwant to make sure that we take a look at.\n\n107\n00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.490\nRemember that regardless\nof what your preference is,\n\n108\n00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.990\nright, that these policies should be.\n\n109\n00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.000\nYour preferences should never\nviolate whatever your company's\n\n110\n00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.030\noverall security policy\non this is going to be.\n\n111\n00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.550\nSo make sure you always have that in mind\nand in hand as these things are set.\n\n112\n00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.990\nThere's no use of you setting\nsomething that actually requires\n\n113\n00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.410\nsomething that nobody in your\norganization's going to follow or\n\n114\n00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.590\nviolates whatever the standard\nsecurity policy is going to be.\n\n115\n00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.866\nSo both of these policies right, password\npolicies and account lockout policies.\n\n116\n00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:42.408\nThese both actually help us to\nreduce a couple of things and\n\n117\n00:06:42.408 --> 00:06:45.770\nthese are generally types of attacks,\nright?\n\n118\n00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.935\nSo when it comes down to password\npolicies, we wanna be able to ensure that\n\n119\n00:06:49.935 --> 00:06:53.102\nif we're still using passwords\nin our organizations.\n\n120\n00:06:53.102 --> 00:06:58.021\nWe want to make sure that we can actually\nset it up in a way that's going to force\n\n121\n00:06:58.021 --> 00:07:00.458\nthe attacker to not have an easy time.\n\n122\n00:07:00.458 --> 00:07:02.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Is what we are going to do.\n\n123\n00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.000\nAnd then, we also want to lock\nit down a little bit better\n\n124\n00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.720\nby actually doing\nan account lock out policy.\n\n125\n00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.670\nThat doesn't give them\nthe time to actually be\n\n126\n00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.530\nable to come up with an attack\nthat's going to be effective.\n\n127\n00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:20.730\nSo the combination of the two\nare really what can help us to provide\n\n128\n00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:26.000\na more effective strategy when your\norganization's using passwords.\n\n129\n00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.200\nAnd this is something that we\nall have to continue to do.\n\n130\n00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.710\nEven though the world is moving towards\nmulti-factor authentication and\n\n131\n00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.960\nit really is starting to make\na major move and it's a good move,\n\n132\n00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.170\nthat doesn't mean that every organization\nis going to be a first adopter.\n\n133\n00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.600\nYou're still gonna find you many end\nup working in an organization that\n\n134\n00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.640\nsaying look this has worked\neffectively for us for a long time.\n\n135\n00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.421\nBut now that things are changing,\nthe computers are getting,\n\n136\n00:07:51.421 --> 00:07:52.586\nyou know, more and more.\n\n137\n00:07:52.586 --> 00:07:54.756\nYou know,\nthey're quicker in what they can do.\n\n138\n00:07:54.756 --> 00:07:56.808\nYou may have to adjust these policies.\n\n139\n00:07:56.808 --> 00:07:58.614\nAnd that's we want to\ntake a look at as well.\n\n140\n00:07:58.614 --> 00:08:02.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, even moving forward we\nmay not even have passwords in the future.\n\n141\n00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.699\nBut for now, what we can do is take\nadvantage of these policies that Ronnie\n\n142\n00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:11.150\nhas showed us and\nuse them to work together.\n\n143\n00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.550\nLike he was saying, to go ahead and\nset those lock out periods so\n\n144\n00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.500\nthat we can prevent against like brute\nforce attacks and things like that.\n\n145\n00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.625\nYou could even go in to the individual\nusers and set those off hours.\n\n146\n00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:24.260\nWe've talked about this in previous\nepisodes, if you don't expect\n\n147\n00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.310\nthem to be working during those times or\ndisable that account.\n\n148\n00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.005\nSo by adding all this things together,\n\n149\n00:08:29.005 --> 00:08:33.560\nyou're really getting be able to make\nthe best use in that security situation.\n\n150\n00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.252\n&gt;&gt; Definitely a good reminder for\nus as we continue to take a look at it.\n\n151\n00:08:37.252 --> 00:08:41.770\nSo let's dive in to some of the policies\nhere, and make sure that we understand\n\n152\n00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.320\nwhat it is that we are taking,\nlooking at and seeing here.\n\n153\n00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.400\nSo let's start off with this idea\nof the Password Policy itself.\n\n154\n00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.309\nWhenever we see that, these are going to\nbe different settings that we're actually\n\n155\n00:08:52.309 --> 00:08:54.100\ngoing to be able to control.\n\n156\n00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.210\nSo once I select Password Policy,\nyou'll notice over on the right hand side.\n\n157\n00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:03.561\nMy details pane will show me what\npolicy can be in place here.\n\n158\n00:09:03.561 --> 00:09:04.780\nSo this is the default one.\n\n159\n00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:09.554\nI don't believe I've changed anything,\nso this is the kind of template\n\n160\n00:09:09.554 --> 00:09:13.624\npolicy that Microsoft has set up or\nWindows has set up for us and\n\n161\n00:09:13.624 --> 00:09:17.490\nit's been around for\na long time as we start to take a look.\n\n162\n00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.399\nAnd let's take a look at\nsome of these options and\n\n163\n00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:22.519\nmake sure that we understand what it is\nthat we're seeing here in the ones we're\n\n164\n00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:24.760\ngenerally going to be taking a look at,\nokay?\n\n165\n00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:30.200\nThe enforcing the password history,\nthis one is set to 24.\n\n166\n00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.790\nNow if you want this\nactually to be applied,\n\n167\n00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.730\nmake sure you put a check mark here.\n\n168\n00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:39.450\nAnd notice it says, hey, how many\npasswords are going to be remembered?\n\n169\n00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.420\nNow this actually does range\nfrom the idea of 0 to 24.\n\n170\n00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.760\nSo I'm actually just using this\nkind of spinner box over here.\n\n171\n00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.250\nSo there's 24, the highest, if I keep\nhitting the up arrow it goes to 0.\n\n172\n00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:55.120\nAnd notice this one says do\nnot keep password history.\n\n173\n00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.770\nAnd that means it's not going to\nmaintain any password history.\n\n174\n00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.790\nNow what is that about?\n\n175\n00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.730\nWell, this means I don't care\nhow many times you end up\n\n176\n00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.120\nusing the exact same password again.\n\n177\n00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:11.582\nSo if Cherokee's favorite password is\nsome type of Kardashian cocktail thing.\n\n178\n00:10:11.582 --> 00:10:13.095\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's actually out there,\n\n179\n00:10:13.095 --> 00:10:15.900\nshe's going to be able to use\nthat same one all the time.\n\n180\n00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.740\nRegardless of whatever other\nthings actually set up here and\n\n181\n00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.530\nwe need to make sure that we understand.\n\n182\n00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:22.390\n&gt;&gt; And this is kind of neat,\nif you think about it,\n\n183\n00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.800\nand it kind of goes with that\nwhole brute force concept.\n\n184\n00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.970\nBecause, let's say, I don't know, just\nthrowing some random numbers out there.\n\n185\n00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.560\nBut if it took a month for\nsomeone to crack my password,\n\n186\n00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.257\nif I had some kind of policy set in place,\nwhere it was cycling through.\n\n187\n00:10:38.257 --> 00:10:40.910\nMaybe it took them two months or\nsomething.\n\n188\n00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.950\nBut by the time they actually cracked\nthat password, if I had cycled back to\n\n189\n00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:49.500\na password that I had used previously,\nthen I would be working against myself and\n\n190\n00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.710\ncounteracting the original\npolicy of changing my password.\n\n191\n00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:56.810\nSo you wouldn't give yourself a large\nenough window, a period of time there so\n\n192\n00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:00.460\nthat you're not helping the attacker,\nyou're actually working against them.\n\n193\n00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.625\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's a very good point to make, so\n\n194\n00:11:02.625 --> 00:11:05.692\none of the ones that is here by default,\nright, is 24.\n\n195\n00:11:05.692 --> 00:11:09.752\nNow, that's pretty extreme depending\non a lot of people, right?\n\n196\n00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:14.240\nThat means you have to go through\na list of 24 different passwords\n\n197\n00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.010\nbefore you can actually\nreuse the same ones again.\n\n198\n00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.870\nSo just kind of realize\nthat you do have that and\n\n199\n00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:25.390\nif you ever need more explanation, it's\nalso right here on the tab as well, okay?\n\n200\n00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.488\nNow we're not going to set that because\nthat's actually pretty high and\n\n201\n00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:29.720\nI like that idea.\n\n202\n00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:35.080\nNow these next two are kind of\nthe ones that go hand in hand.\n\n203\n00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:40.150\nMaximum password age and\nminimum password age as well.\n\n204\n00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:44.180\nYou'll see that if you set one of these\nit will normally require you to set\n\n205\n00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.950\nthe other one as well.\n\n206\n00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:49.460\nSo it'll normally tell you that if you\ndo this you'll also have to do this and\n\n207\n00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.350\nit will change it for you.\n\n208\n00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:55.740\nSo let's start off with this\nidea of maximum password age.\n\n209\n00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.890\nThis is by far, the one that most\npeople will be familiar with,\n\n210\n00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:05.070\nwhich is how long do I get to\nuse that single password, right?\n\n211\n00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:09.980\nSo for us, 42 days, 7 days in a week,\nthat means for 6 weeks, okay?\n\n212\n00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.960\nSo about a month and a half here.\n\n213\n00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.830\nWe can say that every month and\na half is as long as you can\n\n214\n00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:20.440\nkeep a password if you do\nsomething like this as well.\n\n215\n00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.940\nSo maximum password age,\n\n216\n00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.740\nthat's as long as you'll actually\nbe able to use a single password.\n\n217\n00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.340\nNow, the other thing\nthough is this setting, so\n\n218\n00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.130\nI don't have to worry about this one.\n\n219\n00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:35.570\nNotice that on this one,\nyou do have a couple of settings here.\n\n220\n00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.602\nLet's see, maximum password age.\n\n221\n00:12:38.602 --> 00:12:40.344\nLet's see, what's the highest?\n\n222\n00:12:40.344 --> 00:12:44.210\nBetween 1 and 999, okay?\n\n223\n00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:47.285\nNow, when we start talking\nabout that idea of the brute\n\n224\n00:12:47.285 --> 00:12:49.780\nforce attack like what\nCherokee was saying.\n\n225\n00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.900\nThe longer that you set this up, right,\nthe more opportunity you're giving that\n\n226\n00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:58.170\nattacker to be able to hack\nagainst your passwords.\n\n227\n00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:03.710\nSo this is where if you realize that\na seven character password only\n\n228\n00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:09.730\ntakes a week, it would probably not be\na good idea for a hacker to attack that.\n\n229\n00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.798\nIf he can attack a 7 character\npassword within a week,\n\n230\n00:13:12.798 --> 00:13:17.269\nthen having your maximum password age\nat 42 days, you're giving him 6 times\n\n231\n00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:20.625\nthe amount of time he'll ever\nneed to crack your password.\n\n232\n00:13:20.625 --> 00:13:21.919\nAnd he's probably going in and\n\n233\n00:13:21.919 --> 00:13:24.278\ncracking everybody else's\npassword at the same time.\n\n234\n00:13:24.278 --> 00:13:27.520\nAnd may be able to get through\na lot of your organization\n\n235\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.565\nby getting those passwords if\nthat's what you have set up.\n\n236\n00:13:30.565 --> 00:13:34.395\nSo you want to be careful here in\nthe combination of things that you use.\n\n237\n00:13:34.395 --> 00:13:37.245\n&gt;&gt; And you can see how those two\nreally piggyback off of each other.\n\n238\n00:13:37.245 --> 00:13:41.917\nBecause like you said, a seven character\npassword and taking seven days.\n\n239\n00:13:41.917 --> 00:13:45.727\nSo what can we do to make\nthe attacker have to work harder or\n\n240\n00:13:45.727 --> 00:13:48.007\nlonger to crack that password?\n\n241\n00:13:48.007 --> 00:13:50.067\nWell, you have it right there for\nthat password length.\n\n242\n00:13:50.067 --> 00:13:53.017\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if you do something like that,\nwith the length you can either change\n\n243\n00:13:53.017 --> 00:13:55.287\nthe length or\nyou can change the number of days, right?\n\n244\n00:13:55.287 --> 00:13:59.057\nSo instead of giving somebody a whole\nweek, you give them three days instead for\n\n245\n00:13:59.057 --> 00:14:00.470\nthe maximum password age.\n\n246\n00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.820\nPeople will kill you for that.\n\n247\n00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.086\nBut overall though.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I would.\n\n248\n00:14:03.086 --> 00:14:06.112\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Overall though you do have to\n\n249\n00:14:06.112 --> 00:14:08.550\nkind of be careful here.\n\n250\n00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.130\nNow the minimum password days is\na little bit strange, as well.\n\n251\n00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:16.640\nOkay, minimum password age means\nhow long must you use a password.\n\n252\n00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.480\nAll right, so\nnotice that I can set this thing to 0,\n\n253\n00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.510\nand if I do that take a look at\nwhat changed in the description.\n\n254\n00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:27.220\nPassword can be changed immediately, okay?\n\n255\n00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.580\nNow in this combination and\nthe setting that we're seeing here, okay?\n\n256\n00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.360\nSo we just take what we have\nright here and available, okay?\n\n257\n00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.800\nNotice this 24 passwords remembered,\nright?\n\n258\n00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.752\nIf I set this thing up to being\na 0 on the minimum password age,\n\n259\n00:14:42.752 --> 00:14:46.780\nthis means that Cherokee can sit\nhere one after the other one and\n\n260\n00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:51.504\nsimply type in cocktail 1, 2, 3,\n4, 5, all the way through 24.\n\n261\n00:14:51.504 --> 00:14:56.700\nAnd then start typing in what, cocktail\n1 right away, all within the same day.\n\n262\n00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.850\nOkay, now even if we at least set it for\n\n263\n00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:03.410\na day, that means on day number two,\nshe can still cycle through that again.\n\n264\n00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:07.520\nSo here you're actually saying how\nlong do you have to keep this password\n\n265\n00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.770\nbefore you can change it, is what we have.\n\n266\n00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:15.840\nSo you normally will have that kind of\nunusual combination of working with\n\n267\n00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.880\nall three of these, is what you\nalso also have to be able to do.\n\n268\n00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:25.107\nSo if you set it up for\n24 passwords remembered, and you might go,\n\n269\n00:15:25.107 --> 00:15:29.670\nall right, let's do this, let's set\nthe minimum password age to 7 days.\n\n270\n00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:34.213\nWell now you're making someone keep\nthe password for about a week here, okay?\n\n271\n00:15:34.213 --> 00:15:35.100\nAnd if you do that,\n\n272\n00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.370\n7 times 24 whatever that turns out to be\nis some number that I can't do in my hand.\n\n273\n00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:43.410\nBut actually it's what, 98?\n\n274\n00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:44.935\nI believe somewhere around there.\n\n275\n00:15:44.935 --> 00:15:46.420\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Whatever it might be.\n\n276\n00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:50.490\nSo if you do something like that,\nright, and that ends up happening here.\n\n277\n00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.950\nWell, that will.\n\n278\n00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:53.653\nActually, I'm lying to you.\n\n279\n00:15:53.653 --> 00:15:55.451\nThat's 108 or something like that, or 208.\n\n280\n00:15:55.451 --> 00:15:56.975\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yeah,\n\n281\n00:15:56.975 --> 00:15:58.728\nas you start taking a look at that, right?\n\n282\n00:15:58.728 --> 00:16:02.248\nThis is where it does help\nyou out a little bit more.\n\n283\n00:16:02.248 --> 00:16:05.425\nCuz you're requiring somebody\nto at least key that.\n\n284\n00:16:05.425 --> 00:16:06.780\nAnd then that way,\n\n285\n00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:11.520\nif they wanna go through 24 passwords\nthey're gonna be changing it, they have to\n\n286\n00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.500\nwait at least a minimum of at least a week\nbefore they can change their password.\n\n287\n00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.137\nMost of the time people will give up and\ngo let's just not worry about changing it\n\n288\n00:16:19.137 --> 00:16:23.460\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Too many overzealous password changers.\n\n289\n00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.700\nIts usually the office area.\n\n290\n00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no doubt.\n\n291\n00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.140\nSo just you know remember that, okay?\n\n292\n00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.610\nAnd the minimum password link here,\n\n293\n00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.010\nokay, now if I click on this\nexplanation here, right?\n\n294\n00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:37.600\nNotice the term is not maximum but\nthe term is minimum, okay?\n\n295\n00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.020\nSo this is not as long as\nyou can have a password,\n\n296\n00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.670\nthis is saying what is\nthe minimum length here.\n\n297\n00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:48.210\nThis number should absolutely\ngo up at this point in time\n\n298\n00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:49.770\nwhen you start to do this.\n\n299\n00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:55.320\nSo, seven was kind of the default way back\nwhen I think Server 2000 first came out.\n\n300\n00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.280\nSo I would say that today\nprobably at least 10.\n\n301\n00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.110\nI think that that's what Brian\nalso recommends in his book.\n\n302\n00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.800\nIt may even be higher than\nthat if I remember right.\n\n303\n00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.290\nSo just kind of remember that you may\nalso want to change that as well.\n\n304\n00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.890\nRequiring also password\ncomplexity is another one.\n\n305\n00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:16.120\nMaking sure that you actually\nfollow this combination of upper,\n\n306\n00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.110\nlower case letters,\nnumbers, special characters,\n\n307\n00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:22.980\nthat's when you hit the shift key and\nthe row of numbers on your keyboard, too.\n\n308\n00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:27.810\nIt even includes spaces and stuff as well.\n\n309\n00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:31.920\nSo along with that you may also want\nto make sure you meet that complexity\n\n310\n00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.970\nrequirement as well, okay?\n\n311\n00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:37.480\nAnd this last one on storing\npasswords with reversible encryption,\n\n312\n00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.970\nthis is probably not a good thing.\n\n313\n00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:44.810\nYou never want that password to be able to\nbe decrypted, and you might be going, why?\n\n314\n00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.940\nWell, it's because if\nan attacker can get in there and\n\n315\n00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.930\nwhat they're looking at is an encrypted\npassword, you now said what?\n\n316\n00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.220\nI'm also storing it with what?\n\n317\n00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.220\nThe ability to reverse that encryption.\n\n318\n00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.830\nSo now you're even telling them,\nhere's the ability for\n\n319\n00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.710\nyou to decrypt this password.\n\n320\n00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.130\nSo it's probably not something\nyou wanna set either.\n\n321\n00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.540\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, it seems like there\nare a lot of different settings for\n\n322\n00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.750\njust your password policy here.\n\n323\n00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.720\nBut as we have in the chat there,\n\n324\n00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.160\nit says your domain is only as\nstrong as your weakest password.\n\n325\n00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.890\nA viewer had put that in.\n\n326\n00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:17.980\nAnd I think that's a really important\nconcept to remember because it\n\n327\n00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:22.900\nis a huge vulnerability, or I guess weak\nlink if you think about in that way.\n\n328\n00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.670\nSo that's why we have all these extra\nsettings to make sure we can really\n\n329\n00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:27.860\ncontrol these policies.\n\n330\n00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:28.770\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n331\n00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:33.030\nIt's at least a standard boiler plate for\nus to consider, right?\n\n332\n00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.870\nThat ability to be able to\nhave some security setting\n\n333\n00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.470\nthat we can guide off of as well.\n\n334\n00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:42.550\nAnd the great thing is, if you're\nalready in an Active Directory domain,\n\n335\n00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.890\nyou know that these are at\nleast the minimum settings.\n\n336\n00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.540\nThey're not saying you\nhave to leave them there.\n\n337\n00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.470\nBut that's at least the minimum settings.\n\n338\n00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.620\nBut remember that even this, right,\n\n339\n00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:55.540\nis fairly limited, because it is\nactually just coming down based on\n\n340\n00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.660\nsix different types of categories\nthat we're taking a look at.\n\n341\n00:18:58.660 --> 00:18:59.230\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n342\n00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:03.960\n&gt;&gt; But it's really not very\ndetailed in what we can orient to.\n\n343\n00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.770\nSo that's now why we also want to\nintroduce you to something that you may\n\n344\n00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.310\nnot actually be familiar with, or you\nmay not have even heard about it at this\n\n345\n00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:17.730\npoint, which is what we call fine-grained\npassword settings, is what we want.\n\n346\n00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.290\nMake sure I say that right, here.\n\n347\n00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:23.010\nYeah, fine-grained types of password and\naccount lockout policies.\n\n348\n00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:25.840\nNow, the unusual thing about this\nis even though this show is about\n\n349\n00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:30.380\nActive Directory, this is not actually in\nActive Directory, which is strange, right?\n\n350\n00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.690\nSo if we want to create something\nmore fine-grained than what we\n\n351\n00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.070\nhave the ability to do right here, okay?\n\n352\n00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:40.060\nWell, that's what we also want to\nmake sure that we understand, too.\n\n353\n00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.494\nNow, before we go into that,\n\n354\n00:19:41.494 --> 00:19:43.720\nI forgot we didn't take a look\nat the account lockout policy.\n\n355\n00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.748\nSo let's look at these relatively\nquickly as well, okay?\n\n356\n00:19:47.748 --> 00:19:51.070\nNow, we wanna make sure, of course,\nthat the password policy is set\n\n357\n00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:55.800\nto whatever level that our security\ncompliance is gonna require of us.\n\n358\n00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:00.380\nBut also we use that in combination\nwith the lockout here too, okay?\n\n359\n00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.670\nRemember that, for us, the lockout\nis all about a couple of different\n\n360\n00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:11.710\naspects that an attacker could attack us\nif we leave things not locked out, okay?\n\n361\n00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:15.610\nSo for us,\nsuch as the lockout duration, okay?\n\n362\n00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.790\nCurrently, I do not have this defined.\n\n363\n00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:22.380\nAnd if I take a look at this aspect,\nnone because this setting only has meaning\n\n364\n00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.920\nwhen an account is lockout\nthreshold is specified.\n\n365\n00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.490\nSo it determines the number of\nminutes an account is locked out and\n\n366\n00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.410\nremains locked out before\nautomatically becoming unlocked.\n\n367\n00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:34.880\nRanges from zero through 99.\n\n368\n00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.060\nIf you set the account to zero,\n\n369\n00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:42.910\nthe account will be locked out until\nthe administrator explicitly unlocks it.\n\n370\n00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:47.060\nSo that zero is probably\nnot exactly a bad thing.\n\n371\n00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.120\nBut what if it's actually\nnot defined at all?\n\n372\n00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.680\nWell, it means it's not applying at all,\nso\n\n373\n00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.080\nwe don't have anything that\nwould lock us out as well, okay?\n\n374\n00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.470\nSo, on this one, this is where you\nmay choose instead to define it.\n\n375\n00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:05.730\nNow, if you go to zero, it means much\nmore administrative effort, right?\n\n376\n00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.990\nEvery time somebody actually gets locked\nout, that means they've gotta wait for\n\n377\n00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.400\nyou before their account can be unlocked.\n\n378\n00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.380\nAnd even though that might sound super\nsecure, it's definitely super secure\n\n379\n00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:22.180\nby comparison, but it may actually\nbe too much effort in that sense\n\n380\n00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.930\nif you have a lot of users that\nconstantly get locked out.\n\n381\n00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:29.230\nSo here instead, you may wanna set\nthis not for 30 minutes, but maybe for\n\n382\n00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:33.250\n10 minutes or 15 minutes that\nthey're locked out as they do that.\n\n383\n00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.410\nSo that way, they have a chance where\nthey kind of stop and go all right-\n\n384\n00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.240\n&gt;&gt; And this may also be like a trial and\n\n385\n00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.110\nerror depending on your organization.\n\n386\n00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:46.480\nIf your end users have the ability to\nimpact or influence any of these settings,\n\n387\n00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.970\nthey might call in through the help\ndesk and say, hey, once you get so\n\n388\n00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.240\nmany tickets, if it's more bothersome\nthan actually effective, but\n\n389\n00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.030\nsometimes you don't have control\nover that, and it is what is.\n\n390\n00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:57.880\nYou got to follow this policy.\n\n391\n00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so using that duration.\n\n392\n00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.440\nThe other one, of course,\nis the threshold here.\n\n393\n00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.620\nSo let's take a look at\nthe account lockout threshold.\n\n394\n00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.770\nWhen we take a look at the threshold,\n\n395\n00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.940\nit says a security setting determines\nthe number of failed logon attempts.\n\n396\n00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:15.430\nNow, failed logon attempts that causes\na user's account to be locked out.\n\n397\n00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:19.480\nThere's no doubt that when somebody brand\nnew first comes into the organization and\n\n398\n00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.340\nyou have a complex password policy\nthat requires 10 characters long,\n\n399\n00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:28.650\nit may be a little bit challenging for\nthem and they may get locked out.\n\n400\n00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:31.964\nSo, on this one here,\nyou do want to pay attention.\n\n401\n00:22:31.964 --> 00:22:36.580\nZero here means, hey,\nthe account will not ever be locked out.\n\n402\n00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.660\nThat's probably not a good thing as well.\n\n403\n00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:42.720\nThat means somebody can continue to try,\nand try, and try, and\n\n404\n00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.990\ntry with bad passwords.\n\n405\n00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:48.390\nIn other words, a brute force attack,\nand they're not gonna be stopped.\n\n406\n00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.730\nSo instead, you may wanna choose\nsomething like three attempts or\n\n407\n00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:55.480\nfive attempts here, and\nthen it's gonna lock them out as well.\n\n408\n00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.750\nSo, that is a possibility that you\nmay also want to be able to do, too.\n\n409\n00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:01.590\nThe other one, of course,\n\n410\n00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:05.550\nis really trying minimize much more\nadministrative effort here, which is to\n\n411\n00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:10.790\nreset the account lockout policy\nafter a particular number of minutes.\n\n412\n00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:13.310\nSo how often are you going\nto allow somebody to try it?\n\n413\n00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:17.810\nSo after five minutes, let's go ahead and\nlock the account, okay?\n\n414\n00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:20.390\nThat makes sense, okay, whatever it is.\n\n415\n00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:25.440\nSo with five attempts,\nthey're gonna actually be locked out.\n\n416\n00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.660\nBut then, what happens if they\ntry in 30 minutes again and\n\n417\n00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.510\nthey try and\nthey hit five other passwords again?\n\n418\n00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:34.950\nWell, are they still locked out?\n\n419\n00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:39.510\nWell, this one is saying, look,\nlet's reset that after a period of time.\n\n420\n00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.020\nSo if they try again, okay,\n\n421\n00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:46.820\nafter 30 minutes here,\nthen they'll begin to get five again.\n\n422\n00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.610\nSo it actually allows them to\n\n423\n00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.520\nmake five more attempts after\nthe 30 minutes worth of time.\n\n424\n00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.160\nSo you're not actually allowing something\nlike a brute force attack to just\n\n425\n00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:01.190\nsend tons and tons and then just\nretry after a period of time here.\n\n426\n00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.880\nIt just allows them to try,\nbut just so often.\n\n427\n00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.340\nAnd it also limits them to the number\nof attempts that they have, too.\n\n428\n00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:12.200\nSo this is where the combination\nof both the password policy and\n\n429\n00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:17.490\nthe account lockout policy\ntogether provide relatively strong\n\n430\n00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:22.140\ntypes of policies that we can\nbegin to take a look at to\n\n431\n00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.740\nprovide better security for\nour domain that we have.\n\n432\n00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.690\nNow, remember that this is good as\nlong as you're still using passwords.\n\n433\n00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:33.440\nIf you've moved on to\nmultifactor authentications,\n\n434\n00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.690\nit probably isn't going to help too much.\n\n435\n00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:36.490\nBut overall, though,\n\n436\n00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.930\nyou'll probably still see organizations\nthat are going to be using this.\n\n437\n00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:44.210\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, I see what's next on our\nlist, and that's going to be user rights.\n\n438\n00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:47.160\nNow, I know there are quite a few here,\nand looking at the time,\n\n439\n00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.550\nI'm almost wondering,\ndo we have enough time to cover them?\n\n440\n00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:51.390\nAre we going to cover all of them?\n\n441\n00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:55.040\n&gt;&gt; Nope, we're definitely not gonna have\nenough time to even get into user rights.\n\n442\n00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.180\nAnd not only that, though,\n\n443\n00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.970\nI still have some fine grain\npolicies I need to take a look at.\n\n444\n00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.180\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; As well.\n\n445\n00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.424\nAnd that's what happens when\nyou forget like I just did.\n\n446\n00:25:03.424 --> 00:25:06.056\nLook, account lockout policies,\nI forgot that one.\n\n447\n00:25:06.056 --> 00:25:09.701\nSo what we'll probably end up doing is\nwe'll go to a part two on this one.\n\n448\n00:25:09.701 --> 00:25:10.348\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n449\n00:25:10.348 --> 00:25:12.742\n&gt;&gt; And that will help us\ncover what we need to and\n\n450\n00:25:12.742 --> 00:25:16.270\nwe'll move on into the user rights as well\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan.\n\n451\n00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:17.110\nThank you for that.\n\n452\n00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:20.190\nAnd thank you for joining us,\nbut as Ronnie said, stay tuned.\n\n453\n00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:22.110\nWe have more information headed your way.\n\n454\n00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:23.630\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n455\n00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.600\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n456\n00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.430\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n457\n00:25:26.430 -->

00:00:11.912\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:14.420\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Server 101 series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.660\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.530\nIn this episode we'll continue\nlooking at how we can\n\n7\n00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.240\nsecure Windows by using group policy.\n\n8\n00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.900\nAnd with us today, back in studios,\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.240\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n10\n00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.670\n&gt;&gt; It's going better, we are back\nhere taking a look at part 2 of\n\n11\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.010\nusing group policy to help\nus secure Windows servers.\n\n12\n00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.783\nAnd in our first episode, right, we took\na look at the idea of using password\n\n13\n00:00:39.783 --> 00:00:43.755\npolicies, and even the idea of\nthe account lockout policies.\n\n14\n00:00:43.755 --> 00:00:49.270\nBut remember that what we saw there,\nright, is very categorical.\n\n15\n00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.450\nIn other words, very much it had to\nfall in this particular context.\n\n16\n00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.300\nThere wasn't anything easy for us to do.\n\n17\n00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.760\nWe had to go into multiple\nplaces to do this.\n\n18\n00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.700\nBut today, we want to begin by\ntalking about something I know even\n\n19\n00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.180\nthough the show is actually talking\nabout securing with group policy,\n\n20\n00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.920\nI want to talk about something\nthat's not in group policy.\n\n21\n00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.040\nWhich is actually what we call\nfine-grained password policies\n\n22\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.950\nthat are out there for\nus to be able to work with and use.\n\n23\n00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.110\nAnd what we're going to end up seeing in\nall those settings where we had to go to\n\n24\n00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.020\nat least two different locations inside\nof group policy to be able to manage\n\n25\n00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.310\na separate location, of course,\n\n26\n00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.600\nfrom the account lockout policies, a\nseparate location for the password policy.\n\n27\n00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.570\nWe can manage it all in one location and\n\n28\n00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.690\neven get some additional\nbenefits out of it as well.\n\n29\n00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.050\nAnd that´s by using the active directory\nadministrative center to help us out.\n\n30\n00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.820\nSo that is what we´re\nactually taking a look at.\n\n31\n00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.050\nNow, when we start to do this inside\nof the active directory administrative\n\n32\n00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.930\ncenter, it kind of help us out because\nwe´ll see a couple of different things\n\n33\n00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.040\nthat may end up happening.\n\n34\n00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.820\nYou may end up, because of what we call\nthe idea of inheritance that happens\n\n35\n00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.450\nwith group policy objects where one\nobject may actually be influenced by\n\n36\n00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.258\nwhat multiple group policies objects that\nare set on that one particular OU, okay?\n\n37\n00:02:12.258 --> 00:02:16.930\nWell, with fine-grained policies\nthat can also happen as well.\n\n38\n00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.320\nBut when this one happens,\n\n39\n00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.010\nthere is what we call an order of\nprecedence inside of the administrative\n\n40\n00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.160\ncenter that we can actually say\nwhat is going to override what.\n\n41\n00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.760\nSo we can actually change that as well.\n\n42\n00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.360\nNow, the other benefit of being able to do\nthis with fine-grain policies is unlike\n\n43\n00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.740\nthe group policy,\nwhere we can set it on an OU, and\n\n44\n00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.520\non a domain, and\na child OU pretty much and the site.\n\n45\n00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.680\nWell, on those,\n\n46\n00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.830\nthat´s perfectly fine, but what if you\nwanted to put this on an individual user?\n\n47\n00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.038\nYou can´t do that.\n\n48\n00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:58.480\nBut with fine-grained types of policies,\nyou can also apply it to users.\n\n49\n00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.350\nBut even so, it should probably\nbe used with groups as well.\n\n50\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.930\nSo this is something else that\nwe can also be able to do.\n\n51\n00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.120\nNow, if we're going to make\nsure these apply to groups,\n\n52\n00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.260\nyou also have to make sure that there's\nat least one member to a group.\n\n53\n00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.300\nSo don't just create a group that says,\nhey, this is the IT group and\n\n54\n00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.540\nyou don't have any members in it.\n\n55\n00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.420\nIt's not gonna work until you apply\nat least a single active user to\n\n56\n00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.370\nthe group as well.\n\n57\n00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.800\nAll right, so\nthat's what we're gonna end up seeing.\n\n58\n00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.040\nSo let's take a look at how\nwe can use this instead.\n\n59\n00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.750\nSo here it is on my machine.\n\n60\n00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.750\nI've went ahead and connected in.\n\n61\n00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.900\nAnd what we have here is the Active\nDirectory Administrative Center.\n\n62\n00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.560\nFor us, we need to be able to get access\nto those settings that we need to.\n\n63\n00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.680\nBut it's not as intuitive as it seems\nif you're not used to doing this.\n\n64\n00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.170\nSo over here on the left-hand side, let\nme expand this out a little bit more so\n\n65\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.890\nthat everybody can see what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n66\n00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.000\nSo over here in the navigation pane,\nthere's actually two different views here.\n\n67\n00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.790\nAnd it's very difficult for\nus to see if you're not looking for it.\n\n68\n00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.050\nAnd the way that you do that, and let me\nzoom in right up here for us to see this.\n\n69\n00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.480\nIs right here this is\ncalled the List View, and\n\n70\n00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.060\nthen over here is called the Tree View.\n\n71\n00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.120\nWell, in the list view,\nyou will not find it.\n\n72\n00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.090\nIf you're like me, you search for\nit all day and all night.\n\n73\n00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.090\nAnd it didn't actually ever pop up\nwhere I found anything that said\n\n74\n00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.230\npassword policies or settings like that.\n\n75\n00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.820\nIt just didn't happen, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.690\n&gt;&gt; Not a very friendly UI,\nor user interface, there?\n\n77\n00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not the easiest,\nright, to try and\n\n78\n00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.290\nfind this if this is\nyour first time doing it.\n\n79\n00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So you have to go to the tree view.\n\n80\n00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.400\nAnd even then, in the tree view,\nCherokee, we can see\n\n81\n00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.000\nit doesn't really look a lot different\nthan what we saw in the list view.\n\n82\n00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.220\nBut it does kind of order\nthings a little bit more.\n\n83\n00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.710\nLet me expand out, and\nlet's say the domain, right,\n\n84\n00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.060\nwhich is our Office Pro democo.\n\n85\n00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.620\nAnd now this begins to look, well,\nalmost like Active Directory users and\n\n86\n00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.650\ncomputers for a moment, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.190\nBut there are some other things in here\nthat we don't normally see, such as Keys,\n\n88\n00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:09.740\nand LostAndFound down here,\nManaged Service Accounts, Program Data.\n\n89\n00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.050\nAnd what we're looking for underneath all\nof this TPM devices is actually System.\n\n90\n00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.260\nSo if you didn't know where system was,\n\n91\n00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.690\nknow that that's what you\nare supposed to look under,\n\n92\n00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.500\nit would have been very difficult for\nus to even think about trying to set this.\n\n93\n00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.380\nNow, once I have system selected, well,\nits still not easy as we take a look\n\n94\n00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.950\nat what we find underneath that system\ncontainer that you have right there.\n\n95\n00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.229\nNotice that even on all of this,\nright, AdminSDHolder,\n\n96\n00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:44.457\nComPartitions, Dsf-Configuration,\n\n97\n00:05:44.457 --> 00:05:47.830\nDFSR-GlobalSettings.\n\n98\n00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.010\nI don't even know if I'm actually\nin the right location yet.\n\n99\n00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.975\nBut if I scroll down toward the bottom,\nthere it is, finally, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:55.975 --> 00:06:01.500\nAs you start seeing it,\nPassword Settings Container.\n\n101\n00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.070\nWhen you talk about not being easy to\nfind and being able to set this up,\n\n102\n00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.940\nthe recommendation, of course, it really\ndoes help you out if you use this.\n\n103\n00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.680\nBecause all those settings\nare gonna be located in one place.\n\n104\n00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.210\nBut it doesn't look like that they\nactually designed it to make it like,\n\n105\n00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.400\nof course, you wanna use this very easily.\n\n106\n00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.000\nThey really did bury this in some place\nthat, if you really don't have help,\n\n107\n00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.740\nit's not gonna be easy to find at all.\n\n108\n00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.010\n&gt;&gt; And, Ronnie,\nhow did you get this interface as well?\n\n109\n00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.240\nYou're using your R set tools, and so\nyou're working on a remote system, and\n\n110\n00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.280\nthis is kind of, maybe if you're\nfamiliar or working within Office 365,\n\n111\n00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.350\nis this something that we should\nacclimate ourselves with?\n\n112\n00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.650\nIf this is sort of the trend or\nthe way that they're moving us towards?\n\n113\n00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.830\n&gt;&gt; Right, if you think about it, right?\n\n114\n00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.180\nThe very fact that even though\ngroup policy is there and\n\n115\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.000\nhas been there for a long time,\nthe management of it\n\n116\n00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.760\nis a little bit clunky where you have to\nkind of compare both of those options\n\n117\n00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.020\nin two different locations to make sure\nthat they're actually working right.\n\n118\n00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.550\nAnd usually, the only way for us to do\nthat in an effective, I'm not gonna say\n\n119\n00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:04.300\nthe only way, but usually an effective\nway for us to do that is we apply it,\n\n120\n00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.770\nwe put a test account into an OU,\nand then we see if it takes setting.\n\n121\n00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.250\nAnd then when it doesn't, then we go back,\nstart modifying and changing it.\n\n122\n00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.010\nBut here,\nwe can see everything in one location.\n\n123\n00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.320\nWe have a direct comparison to all those\nsettings that we did see right there so\n\n124\n00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.880\nit's easier for us to kinda troubleshoot\nback and forth between them.\n\n125\n00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.020\nSo this is a recommended way, but\n\n126\n00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.140\nthere's no official Microsoft way that\nsays yes, you should do this, right?\n\n127\n00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.240\nBut I know that as you read Brian's book,\nright, you'll actually see he says\n\n128\n00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.930\nI recommend that you use these and don't\nworry about the regular group policy.\n\n129\n00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.680\nBut just when we say that, right?\n\n130\n00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.660\nAnd I know that that's\na great recommendation,\n\n131\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.530\ncuz I know Brian and he wouldn't lead\nus wrong, he wouldn't do it on purpose.\n\n132\n00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.730\nBut I know that everybody's gonna\nhave to deal with the very fact that\n\n133\n00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.580\nthey're working with their\nown security policies.\n\n134\n00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.550\nAnd if it says set up the actual group\npolicy in the way that it's supposed to-\n\n135\n00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:56.424\n&gt;&gt; That traditional interface-\n\n136\n00:07:56.424 --> 00:07:57.628\n&gt;&gt; Then, you're gonna have to do it\n\n137\n00:07:57.628 --> 00:07:58.532\nin the traditional way.\n\n138\n00:07:58.532 --> 00:08:00.086\nNow, it doesn't always make that way,\nright?\n\n139\n00:08:00.086 --> 00:08:01.394\nIf you can show a better reason,\n\n140\n00:08:01.394 --> 00:08:04.410\ndo it You might be able to convince\nwhoever's in charge of that to change.\n\n141\n00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:05.692\nBut just kind of remember,\n\n142\n00:08:05.692 --> 00:08:08.940\nyou do have to follow whatever\npolicies that you have in place there.\n\n143\n00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.710\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nset this up a little bit more, all right.\n\n144\n00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:18.280\nSo now that I have the Password Settings\ncontainer, well, if I right-click on it,\n\n145\n00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.070\nnotice it's easy to select New,\nand then I can see Settings.\n\n146\n00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:26.390\nNow, if you don't like, if you're not\na habitual right clicker, like I am.\n\n147\n00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:30.300\nYou do have over here in the right\nhand side the task pane, where notice,\n\n148\n00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.160\nPassword Settings Container.\n\n149\n00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.930\nNow, you can select New from there,\nand there it is.\n\n150\n00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:37.880\nSame location it's gonna bring you to.\n\n151\n00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.680\nIt gives you multiple options to be\nable to do this if you choose to.\n\n152\n00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:47.240\nSo let me select the Password Settings,\nand now, here you can see the details.\n\n153\n00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.110\nRemember that inside, if we compare it to\nthe group policy, let me bring that up,\n\n154\n00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:52.710\njust to make a comparison.\n\n155\n00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.910\nSo here is the Group Policy\nmanagement center and\n\n156\n00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:59.650\nI'm gonna expand out\nthe default domain policy, and\n\n157\n00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:05.210\nexpand out policies, and\nwindow settings here, security settings.\n\n158\n00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.950\nSo even that, right, is already a little\nbit clunky on how to get access to it.\n\n159\n00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:14.760\nAnd it's under here, under\nAccount Settings, under Account Policies.\n\n160\n00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.340\nAnd I’m doing this on purpose right now,\nso as I scroll through,\n\n161\n00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.715\nI have to set this up first,\nand then set these up.\n\n162\n00:09:21.715 --> 00:09:26.990\nSo to go back and forth and\njust to compare them after setting them,\n\n163\n00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.220\nthat is a little bit clunky as\nyou start to do stuff like that.\n\n164\n00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:35.290\nWe compare that to what we saw here,\nlet me see if I can bring it up here,\n\n165\n00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.390\nthere we go.\n\n166\n00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.650\nAll those settings essentially appear\nright here under Password Settings.\n\n167\n00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.130\nEnforce the minimum length,\n\n168\n00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.990\nenforce the password history, password\nmust meet complexity requirements.\n\n169\n00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.550\nThose are things we did see\nin the password settings.\n\n170\n00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.870\nThe same thing on the age\noptions as well and\n\n171\n00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.020\nthen the lockout options\nthat are also available.\n\n172\n00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.910\nThose are all the same utility and\n\n173\n00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:01.390\nsettings that we normally see inside\nof the group policy management center.\n\n174\n00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:05.150\nSo the only other thing that you have\nis that when you do select to do this,\n\n175\n00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.920\nit really requires at least two\nthings from you which of course,\n\n176\n00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.360\nis a name that should be unique for\nhow you're gonna do this.\n\n177\n00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.087\nSo let's say that I'm gonna do like\noffice three, let's do this instead.\n\n178\n00:10:17.087 --> 00:10:18.480\nLet's do road crew.\n\n179\n00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:25.600\nRoadcrew-PP for password policy.\n\n180\n00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.880\nAnd notice this preference setting.\n\n181\n00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.080\nNow, if I hover over it and\nyou're not sure, well it kind of gives us,\n\n182\n00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.129\nit says here, right?\n\n183\n00:10:32.129 --> 00:10:33.880\nIt says password.\n\n184\n00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.570\nPassword setting with a lower precedence\nnumber will overwrite one with\n\n185\n00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:39.830\na higher numbers.\n\n186\n00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.080\nSo this gives you the ability\nnot to actually worry about\n\n187\n00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.350\nthe idea of the order of,\n&gt;&gt; Precedence.\n\n188\n00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.160\n&gt;&gt; Precedence, which I can't say.\n\n189\n00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.940\nYeah, that you would normally find, right?\n\n190\n00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:56.680\nDoes policy affecting this as my parent\nowe you, or is it my child owe you?\n\n191\n00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.560\nWas this at the domain level,\nwhatever it is here?\n\n192\n00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.150\nI can actually say,\nI don't care which one that it is.\n\n193\n00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:06.200\nHere's the one that i want to apply\nwhatever one that I choose as a lower\n\n194\n00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.440\nnumber, okay?\n\n195\n00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.820\nSo you can actually make all\nthat end up happening, okay?\n\n196\n00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.952\nAnd then down here at the bottom,\nright, if you want to, of course,\n\n197\n00:11:13.952 --> 00:11:16.560\nyou add an encryption, that's always good.\n\n198\n00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:22.390\nThe additional options that you have right\nhere besides the settings we normally see,\n\n199\n00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.460\nit's gonna be this protecting\nfrom accidental deletion.\n\n200\n00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:29.010\nAnd then,\nif I enforce the account lockout policy,\n\n201\n00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.350\nnotice that it's actually not\nthat different over here.\n\n202\n00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:36.122\nBut now, I can directly\napply this to right here and\n\n203\n00:11:36.122 --> 00:11:41.932\nthen over on the right hand side, I'm\ngonna click this ad button to change it.\n\n204\n00:11:41.932 --> 00:11:44.028\nAnd now, look at what it\ngives me the ability to do.\n\n205\n00:11:44.028 --> 00:11:50.440\nIt says by default, I'm gonna search users\nand groups that I want to apply this to.\n\n206\n00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.370\nSo if I wanted to, I could go ahead and\nadd in some groups.\n\n207\n00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.290\nSo I'm just gonna add in, let's say,\ndomain admins as an example.\n\n208\n00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.810\nAnd the reason why is off the top of\nmy head, I know that that group exists.\n\n209\n00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:04.472\nBut I had created one for Road Crew,\nright, an actual group called Road Crew,\n\n210\n00:12:04.472 --> 00:12:05.262\nI could do that.\n\n211\n00:12:05.262 --> 00:12:10.540\nBut I think I just created the OU for\nit and just added in people into that OU.\n\n212\n00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.340\nSo I can select Check Names.\n\n213\n00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:15.480\nDid I misspell that?\n\n214\n00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.430\nNo, there we go.\n\n215\n00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.170\nI was gonna say maybe I just didn't\nclick on it, but there it is.\n\n216\n00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.854\nAnd it underlines, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're having my patience level today.\n\n217\n00:12:21.854 --> 00:12:23.000\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah.\n\n218\n00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.630\nSo there it is.\n\n219\n00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:27.660\nSo it underlines it, it tells me that\nI found it inside of Active Directory.\n\n220\n00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.190\nI can click Okay, and there we are.\n\n221\n00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:31.910\nWe can apply it to domain admins.\n\n222\n00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.412\nLet me change this of for a moment too.\n\n223\n00:12:34.412 --> 00:12:38.000\nLet's say that I also wanted to add in,\nlet's see if Cherokee is in here.\n\n224\n00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.920\nI don't know if I actually put in,\nlet's see C Boose or Cherokee.\n\n225\n00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.002\nThere we go, okay.\n\n226\n00:12:43.002 --> 00:12:48.700\nSo now you can see I added in\nCherokee's name also, and I click Okay.\n\n227\n00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:56.043\nSo now, the policy can actually\napply to an individual user,\n\n228\n00:12:56.043 --> 00:12:59.440\nas well as a group if we choose to.\n\n229\n00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:05.520\nSo, it does give you that granularity,\nthat fine grained ability to say, hey.\n\n230\n00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:11.370\nReally we wanna lock Cherokee, only\nCherokee down to this if we choose to,\n\n231\n00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:16.590\nor this particular group if we want to\nas well and not affect anybody else.\n\n232\n00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.260\n&gt;&gt; Always picking on me, Ronnie.\n\n233\n00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.005\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're actually here.\n\n234\n00:13:20.005 --> 00:13:21.711\nAnd that makes it a big part of it.\n\n235\n00:13:21.711 --> 00:13:23.879\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so whoever else hosts with me,\n\n236\n00:13:23.879 --> 00:13:25.209\nI'll pick on them too.\n\n237\n00:13:25.209 --> 00:13:26.334\nYou can ask them.\n\n238\n00:13:26.334 --> 00:13:28.160\nI'll definitely do that.\n\n239\n00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.790\nBut yeah, that's pretty much it, right?\n\n240\n00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.290\nSo if you think that this\nis much more grained,\n\n241\n00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:37.210\nright, it gives you that better\nability to kind of massage the way\n\n242\n00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:42.220\nthe policy works instead of going,\nI know I need a different policy for\n\n243\n00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.520\nCherokee but she isn't even\npart of this group or this OU.\n\n244\n00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.370\nDo I need to make a special OU just for\nCherokee now?\n\n245\n00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.083\nWell, no.\n\n246\n00:13:50.083 --> 00:13:52.618\nIf you need to, you can actually\nuse something like this and\n\n247\n00:13:52.618 --> 00:13:53.640\nthat will help you out.\n\n248\n00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.217\nAnd another thing that gives you the\nability to have much more detail in terms\n\n249\n00:13:58.217 --> 00:14:00.863\nof the control and definitely, of course,\n\n250\n00:14:00.863 --> 00:14:05.830\nincreasing the security through the usage\nof passwords inside of your network.\n\n251\n00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:06.910\nThat's actually a good thing too.\n\n252\n00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.300\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, when we talk\nabout user rights assignments,\n\n253\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.140\nI know that there are quite a bit here.\n\n254\n00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.845\nAre we gonna have time\nto cover all of those?\n\n255\n00:14:13.845 --> 00:14:16.140\nAre we going to cover all of those?\n\n256\n00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.800\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's a lot, okay?\n\n257\n00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.060\nWhen it comes down to it with user\nrights assignments, there are a ton.\n\n258\n00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.070\nLet me show you what Cherokee\nis talking about here.\n\n259\n00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:28.910\nSo if I go ahead and\nexpand out the Computer Management Editor\n\n260\n00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:34.200\nhere for us since we're already in\nhere under the default domain policy.\n\n261\n00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.930\nWe start taking a look at user rights.\n\n262\n00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.360\nNotice this is one of those that's\na little bit tricky as well.\n\n263\n00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.233\nI looked through here and\n\n264\n00:14:43.233 --> 00:14:48.645\nI don't see anything that says user\nrights assignments right away, okay.\n\n265\n00:14:48.645 --> 00:14:51.605\nAnd the reason why is\nbecause like everything else\n\n266\n00:14:51.605 --> 00:14:56.186\nin terms of security is buried inside\nof group policy, it's never exactly,\n\n267\n00:14:56.186 --> 00:14:58.670\nit jumps immediately right out, right?\n\n268\n00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:01.910\nSo if I expand that local policies,\n\n269\n00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.449\nnow notice that we have\nUser Rights Assignments.\n\n270\n00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.610\nNow, I'm just taking a look as I\nselected User Rights Assignment.\n\n271\n00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.612\nOver here on the right hand side,\nif I use the scroll bar, Cherokee,\n\n272\n00:15:14.612 --> 00:15:17.648\nyou can see there's a ton\nof settings right there for\n\n273\n00:15:17.648 --> 00:15:20.410\nus to be able to take a look at and\nto think about.\n\n274\n00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.980\nBut the problem is, we don't have enough\ntime to actually go through all of them,\n\n275\n00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.760\nso we'll only be taking a look\nat a few of them instead.\n\n276\n00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and because there are quite\na bit, but are we able to let's say,\n\n277\n00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.730\nout of all of these available\nconfiguration settings here,\n\n278\n00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:39.430\nwhat if we didn't want to use one of those\ntemplates or those preconfigured settings?\n\n279\n00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.610\nDo we have the ability to\ncustomize those like we did,\n\n280\n00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.440\nlike we saw with our passwords,\nthe fine-grain?\n\n281\n00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.262\n&gt;&gt; Well, not on this one, right?\n\n282\n00:15:48.262 --> 00:15:51.890\nOn this one, the idea of using\nthe User Rights Assignments, we don't have\n\n283\n00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:55.420\nan additional option like what we\nsaw in the fine-grain policies here.\n\n284\n00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:59.871\nOn this one, it is kind of\nan all-or-nothing that applies to that\n\n285\n00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:04.002\nparticular Where this object is\ngonna end up being used and for\n\n286\n00:16:04.002 --> 00:16:06.080\nthat computer that they have.\n\n287\n00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.383\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\n\n288\n00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:10.735\ntake a look at just some of the ones\nthat you may want to be familiar with.\n\n289\n00:16:10.735 --> 00:16:13.463\nAnd the one that we're gonna start off\nwith is a little bit more unusual.\n\n290\n00:16:13.463 --> 00:16:16.908\nBecause it's one that you\nnever want to use but\n\n291\n00:16:16.908 --> 00:16:20.716\nat the same time,\nit is one that we wanna point out.\n\n292\n00:16:20.716 --> 00:16:23.486\nBecause the great thing is over time,\nright?\n\n293\n00:16:23.486 --> 00:16:28.463\nSome of these have appeared a long time\nago when group policy was pretty much\n\n294\n00:16:28.463 --> 00:16:30.810\nfirst kind of implemented.\n\n295\n00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:36.309\nAnd now they're really not necessary\nbecause there are newer apparatuses\n\n296\n00:16:36.309 --> 00:16:41.206\nin place or structures in place,\nthat help us to do the same thing.\n\n297\n00:16:41.206 --> 00:16:44.410\nSo as you´re examining this,\nlet´s take a look at the user rights here.\n\n298\n00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:47.956\nThere is this one right here, okay?\n\n299\n00:16:47.956 --> 00:16:52.280\nThat says,\nact as part of the operating system.\n\n300\n00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:59.705\nSo this allows us to allow any\nrunning process to impersonate a user,\n\n301\n00:16:59.705 --> 00:17:04.196\nwithout any authentication happening.\n\n302\n00:17:04.196 --> 00:17:09.333\nNow hopefully when you actually hear that,\nwithout authentication impersonation.\n\n303\n00:17:09.333 --> 00:17:09.942\n&gt;&gt; Ding, ding, ding.\n\n304\n00:17:09.942 --> 00:17:14.509\n&gt;&gt; That that kind of, yeah, rings a bell\nin your head that I don't know when I\n\n305\n00:17:14.509 --> 00:17:17.530\nwould actually choose to use this, okay?\n\n306\n00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:21.729\nWell today, we really probably would not\never choose to use something like this.\n\n307\n00:17:21.729 --> 00:17:24.695\nBecause this kind of\nmimics what we have now,\n\n308\n00:17:24.695 --> 00:17:27.437\nwhich is essentially a service account.\n\n309\n00:17:27.437 --> 00:17:31.575\nBut instead of actually doing it without\nany authentication service accounts\n\n310\n00:17:31.575 --> 00:17:33.965\nnormally manage their own authentication.\n\n311\n00:17:33.965 --> 00:17:36.841\nSo it's probably better\nthat we use some of this.\n\n312\n00:17:36.841 --> 00:17:41.287\nToday, because we do have on our\nsystems when we create them,\n\n313\n00:17:41.287 --> 00:17:47.283\nwe actually create something that we call\nthe local system account that's there.\n\n314\n00:17:47.283 --> 00:17:49.807\nIt actually allows us to be\nable to take advantage of it.\n\n315\n00:17:49.807 --> 00:17:53.744\nSo this is one that really is not\nsomething that you ever want to\n\n316\n00:17:53.744 --> 00:17:55.118\nactually have to do.\n\n317\n00:17:55.118 --> 00:17:58.736\nUnless you are running some service\non a machine that's so old,\n\n318\n00:17:58.736 --> 00:18:02.910\nthat they don't recognize the idea\nof a service account anymore.\n\n319\n00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.100\nBut just in case,\nyou ever get an inkling and\n\n320\n00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.250\na desire to go,\nI wonder should I ever run this?\n\n321\n00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:13.900\nThat one no, so leave it as not defined or\ngo ahead and disable it.\n\n322\n00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:18.285\nThis is not something you ever really\nneed, because it's not really necessary\n\n323\n00:18:18.285 --> 00:18:21.500\nanymore, but it is a good one for\nus to think about, okay?\n\n324\n00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:26.523\nNow Cherokee we've talked about this is\nother Active Directory episodes as well,\n\n325\n00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:30.553\nwhen it's talked about managing\nthe computer accounts, right?\n\n326\n00:18:30.553 --> 00:18:31.130\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n327\n00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.920\n&gt;&gt; That in Active Directory,\n\n328\n00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:38.700\nevery single user normally has the ability\nto add in a number of computers,\n\n329\n00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.760\nregardless of whether they actually\nhave high privileges or not, okay?\n\n330\n00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.255\nDo you remember the number of\ncomputer that you usually use?\n\n331\n00:18:45.255 --> 00:18:47.420\n&gt;&gt; I wanna say ten.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, ten is actually right.\n\n332\n00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.461\nSo when we do this, right?\n\n333\n00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:52.783\nIt doesn't matter as long as a user\nhas an account in Active Directory.\n\n334\n00:18:52.783 --> 00:18:58.342\nThey can add up to ten computers\ninto an Active Directory network.\n\n335\n00:18:58.342 --> 00:19:01.600\nNow that you go,\nwell that's a great idea, right?\n\n336\n00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.990\nThat means as new computers come in, okay?\n\n337\n00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:09.046\nI don't have to send Cherokee around\nto add in all of those computers to\n\n338\n00:19:09.046 --> 00:19:10.590\nthe domain, right?\n\n339\n00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:14.210\nSo Cherokee is going yes,\nthat sounds like a great idea.\n\n340\n00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.395\nWell it's a great idea until\nat least some point, right?\n\n341\n00:19:18.395 --> 00:19:21.390\nIf you showing people how to do this,\nthat all of a sudden they go,\n\n342\n00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.920\nwell you know what I'm gonna do?\n\n343\n00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.931\nI'm gonna take Cherokee's laptop that\nshe's just brought in from home.\n\n344\n00:19:26.931 --> 00:19:29.328\nWe don't have a clue what\nnetwork it's been on before,\n\n345\n00:19:29.328 --> 00:19:31.626\nwe don't know if it's been\ninfected with anything.\n\n346\n00:19:31.626 --> 00:19:34.955\nI'm pretty sure Cherokee has that, but-\n&gt;&gt; What version of updates I'm running?\n\n347\n00:19:34.955 --> 00:19:36.136\n&gt;&gt; What version of the OS, yep.\n\n348\n00:19:36.136 --> 00:19:36.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, operating system.\n\n349\n00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:37.744\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you don't have a clue.\n\n350\n00:19:37.744 --> 00:19:38.716\n&gt;&gt; You could have an unhealthy machine.\n\n351\n00:19:38.716 --> 00:19:42.909\n&gt;&gt; You could actually have an unhealthy\nmachine and that user could easily join it\n\n352\n00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:46.864\nto the domain, which now means it's\nunderneath that security control.\n\n353\n00:19:46.864 --> 00:19:49.954\nAnd if you don't have everything turned\non like you think that you do in your\n\n354\n00:19:49.954 --> 00:19:52.226\nnetwork, it could be\na compromising machine, okay?\n\n355\n00:19:52.226 --> 00:19:57.427\nSo even though it sounds like a great\nidea in terms of efficiency at times.\n\n356\n00:19:57.427 --> 00:20:00.713\nIt’s probably something that most of the\nusers inside of our network are probably\n\n357\n00:20:00.713 --> 00:20:02.250\nnever gonna take advantage of.\n\n358\n00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.040\nThe very fact that it requires them\nto do multiple steps to make it\n\n359\n00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.840\nhappen is probably not gonna key.\n\n360\n00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.250\nBut using this setting,\nlet's go back to the computer.\n\n361\n00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.949\nUsing this Add workstation\nto domain setting here.\n\n362\n00:20:12.949 --> 00:20:18.008\nLet me go bring up the Properties,\nso that we can see it.\n\n363\n00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:21.410\nYou look and go okay,\nwhat's the big deal here?\n\n364\n00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:26.980\nDefine these policy settings, I've already\nhad mine set here to Domain Admins.\n\n365\n00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.790\nNow you might be going really,\nonly Domain Admins?\n\n366\n00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.470\nYou don't have to do that, okay?\n\n367\n00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:35.252\nYou can actually create a group\nthat only gives them the privilege.\n\n368\n00:20:35.252 --> 00:20:39.634\nYou can call it domain join,\nsomething like that.\n\n369\n00:20:39.634 --> 00:20:43.770\nAnd then add your users in that and\nonly give them the privileges to do this.\n\n370\n00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.201\nI did this as an example\nearlier as I was testing it,\n\n371\n00:20:46.201 --> 00:20:49.214\ntrying to see if I could add in groups,\nI simply did it that way.\n\n372\n00:20:49.214 --> 00:20:53.450\nSo for you to do that, you simply add in\na particular user, or a group name here.\n\n373\n00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:57.852\nSo if I pick on, let's say Wes Brian.\n\n374\n00:20:57.852 --> 00:20:58.857\n&gt;&gt; You're picking on Wes, good.\n\n375\n00:20:58.857 --> 00:20:59.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n376\n00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:00.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I think I've already\n\n377\n00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:01.631\nadded you in here.\n\n378\n00:21:01.631 --> 00:21:04.607\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so then that means I would\nbe allowed to add those computers to\n\n379\n00:21:04.607 --> 00:21:05.245\nthe network.\n\n380\n00:21:05.245 --> 00:21:05.787\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n381\n00:21:05.787 --> 00:21:06.541\n&gt;&gt; The domain.\n\n382\n00:21:06.541 --> 00:21:11.437\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so that didn't actually\nunderline did it, let me try that again.\n\n383\n00:21:11.437 --> 00:21:13.104\nLet me browse here and\n\n384\n00:21:13.104 --> 00:21:19.223\nwe'll do it the official way cuz sometimes\nI think it's wbryan is what I have.\n\n385\n00:21:19.223 --> 00:21:22.900\nIf my computer would stop locking up,\nthere we go, okay?\n\n386\n00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.498\nSo that's what I was expecting to see,\n\n387\n00:21:24.498 --> 00:21:26.660\nI was like why did that\nnot show up that way?\n\n388\n00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.600\nSo now, notice we can do this, right?\n\n389\n00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.372\nYou don't have always to\ndo a particular group, but\n\n390\n00:21:31.372 --> 00:21:33.141\nit normally is easier to do this.\n\n391\n00:21:33.141 --> 00:21:35.086\nAnd that limits the number of users or\n\n392\n00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:39.490\npeople who have been able to add computers\nto your network and that's a good thing.\n\n393\n00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:41.583\n&gt;&gt; And now Wes has the ability to do so\nas well.\n\n394\n00:21:41.583 --> 00:21:43.760\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so that's always a good thing.\n\n395\n00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.860\nThe other one of course,\n\n396\n00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.844\nis allowing people to log in\nthrough remote desktop services.\n\n397\n00:21:48.844 --> 00:21:51.980\nYou wanna limit the number of\npeople that really need to do this.\n\n398\n00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.170\nNot everybody necessarily\nneeds to do this, but\n\n399\n00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:57.540\nhere again is the same thing where\nyou actually limit that as well.\n\n400\n00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.380\nLet's see, a couple other ones here.\n\n401\n00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:04.730\nDebugging programs is another one\nthat's actually a good one to\n\n402\n00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.710\nfocus in on as well.\n\n403\n00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:09.300\nThis is a potential vulnerability here,\n\n404\n00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:14.330\nif you are actually allowing everybody\nto be able to get access into this.\n\n405\n00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.535\nGood thing this is currently\nnot defined right now, so\n\n406\n00:22:17.535 --> 00:22:20.611\nif I actually leave it undefined,\nlet's see here.\n\n407\n00:22:20.611 --> 00:22:22.835\nDoes the same thing, there we go,\n\n408\n00:22:22.835 --> 00:22:27.088\nthis is what we want to make sure\nthat we take a look at here.\n\n409\n00:22:27.088 --> 00:22:31.640\nAssigning this user's right can be\na security risk, to only assign it to\n\n410\n00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:37.420\ntrusted users here, so\nbe careful with that particular service.\n\n411\n00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.950\nAnd lastly, the only other one that\nwe really wanna take a look at in\n\n412\n00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:45.250\nany sense here is gonna\nbe log on as a service.\n\n413\n00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:51.390\nSo not deny log on, but let me see if\nI can find it, Log on as a service.\n\n414\n00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:52.747\nLet me double click on it so\n\n415\n00:22:52.747 --> 00:22:56.100\nthat we can see what this\nparticular setting does for us.\n\n416\n00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.940\nIf I click on Explain, this is something\nthat we are actually going to dive\n\n417\n00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:04.390\nmuch more in depth in a little\nbit later on as we manage\n\n418\n00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.890\nthe actual Windows services\nthat are available.\n\n419\n00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:07.430\nBut right here,\n\n420\n00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:12.500\nit says this security setting allows a\nsecurity principal to log on as a service.\n\n421\n00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.650\nServices can be configured to run\nas local system, local service,\n\n422\n00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:22.060\nnetwork service accounts, which have\nbuilt in rights to log on as a service.\n\n423\n00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.640\nAny service that runs under a separate\nuser account must also be assigned\n\n424\n00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.190\nthat right.\n\n425\n00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:32.720\nSo on this one, it is not set for us and\nit's probably something we really do not\n\n426\n00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:38.250\nneed to use if we'll end up creating\nwhat we call service accounts here.\n\n427\n00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:43.040\nOr manage types of services accounts,\nthat normally replaces this need.\n\n428\n00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.510\nWhat normally ends up happening\nat the very beginning, and\n\n429\n00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:48.120\nI don't wanna say this,\nfor everybody, right?\n\n430\n00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.910\nBut as somebody is learning\nhow to do this on their own,\n\n431\n00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:54.580\ninstead of trying to\ncreate a service account,\n\n432\n00:23:54.580 --> 00:24:00.060\nusually they just take their own account\nand they assign it as this, right?\n\n433\n00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:05.240\nBecause certain applications do need\nto have an account that they run under.\n\n434\n00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.660\nSo instead of them coming\nup with a new one,\n\n435\n00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:11.070\nthey just go and let me type in my own\nusername and credentials and that works.\n\n436\n00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.480\nAnd you can do something like that,\n\n437\n00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.860\nyou can add it in right here\nto make sure that happens.\n\n438\n00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:18.630\nBut there are issues that are gonna come\nalong that we're gonna ned up seeing.\n\n439\n00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:22.870\nBut one of the issues is, let's say we\nchoose Cherokee's account to do this.\n\n440\n00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.340\nAnd then Cherokee says, my gosh,\n\n441\n00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:28.650\nmy password, I need to change it\nbecause I think it's been compromised.\n\n442\n00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:33.710\nWell if Cherokee changes it on her\nparticular now logged onto the service.\n\n443\n00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:37.440\nIf it doesn't get updated there,\nthat service is not gonna run,\n\n444\n00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.990\nit's gonna end up failing.\n\n445\n00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:44.500\nSo when taking a look at the idea of user,\nwrites assignments and\n\n446\n00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:49.350\nalso this idea of taking a look at\n\n447\n00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:53.780\nthe settings that we've been talking\nabout here, with the fine grain policies.\n\n448\n00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:58.000\nThere is a ton of information\nthat we do have available.\n\n449\n00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.031\nSo a lot of settings here under Group\nPolicy, a good server admin is gonna take\n\n450\n00:25:02.031 --> 00:25:05.891\nthe time to learn about some of these\ndifferent settings that you can see.\n\n451\n00:25:05.891 --> 00:25:09.250\nThat's gonna be common in just\nabout every network that you go to.\n\n452\n00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.844\nBut Cherokee, speaking of that,\nthere's a lot more for us to do but\n\n453\n00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:13.799\nnot a lot of time.\n\n454\n00:25:13.799 --> 00:25:14.960\n&gt;&gt; That's right, Ronnie.\n\n455\n00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.350\nWe do have a lot more to cover.\n\n456\n00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:19.340\nAnd as a matter of fact, looking at\neverything that you've shown us so\n\n457\n00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.800\nfar, we need to even take a look at how\nwe can check our work and go back and\n\n458\n00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.450\naudit those policies.\n\n459\n00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:28.140\nBut we are out of time for this show,\nso ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n460\n00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.120\nWe have more information heading your way.\n\n461\n00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.110\nWe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n462\n00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:32.998\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n463\n00:25:32.998 --> 00:25:34.119\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n464\n00:25:34.119 --> 00:25:36.290\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n465\n00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:43.516\n[MUSIC]\n\n466\n00:25:43.516 -->

00:00:09.298\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:09.298 --> 00:00:16.350\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your Server 101\n&gt;&gt; I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.560\nSo we've actually made it to part three\nand we are gonna continue to looking at\n\n6\n00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.320\nhow we can use group policy to help us\nsecure our Windows operating system.\n\n7\n00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.010\nWith us today, back in studio,\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.100\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.330\n&gt;&gt; It's going well, as we continue on to\ntake a look here at the idea of securing\n\n10\n00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.300\nour servers here with group policy.\n\n11\n00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.260\nSo if you remember in\nthe first couple of sections,\n\n12\n00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.290\nfirst couple of episodes\nthat we've done on this.\n\n13\n00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.863\n&gt;&gt; We didn't just looked at group policy.\n\n14\n00:00:42.863 --> 00:00:46.829\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we did kind of looked at it\na little bit in terms of security and\n\n15\n00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.410\nwe delved into a little bit in depth.\n\n16\n00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.940\nAnd now we are continuing along with a few\n\n17\n00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.460\nadditional settings that\nwe have to take a look at.\n\n18\n00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.330\nSo we are going to start\nhere by talking about\n\n19\n00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.870\nsomething that we really need to also\nconsider in terms of group policy,\n\n20\n00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.010\nwhich is the idea of auditing our\nsystems that we have available to us.\n\n21\n00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.860\nIt's great to be able to set things up and\n\n22\n00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.270\nto know that things are actually done, but\nwe also need to have the ability at times.\n\n23\n00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.390\nTo verify to be able to confirm that\nthings are actually happening or\n\n24\n00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.900\nnot happening, right?\n\n25\n00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.270\nSo, group policy gives us that ability\nto set up what we called different\n\n26\n00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.590\naudits that we can do so that we can tell\nwhen an event has actually occurred.\n\n27\n00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.920\nWe can even at times tell\nhow long the event took.\n\n28\n00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.070\nAnd even possibly when it ended or\nwhen something actually didn't work.\n\n29\n00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.180\nSo those are nice things for us because\nthere's times when we set it up,\n\n30\n00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.410\nnot an easy confirmation except\nto wait for something to happen.\n\n31\n00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.000\nAnd if nobody complains about it,\nwe kind of go okay.\n\n32\n00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.270\nWell, maybe that's not\nshould a good theory.\n\n33\n00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.620\nTo actually follow, but we might need\na little bit more detail on that.\n\n34\n00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.760\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie you're talking about\nlike routine maintenance auditing.\n\n35\n00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.870\nWe're not just reserving auditing for\nany kind of like forensic incident or\n\n36\n00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.090\nsecurity incident.\n\n37\n00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.100\nWe're doing this, we have the ability to\ndo this to make sure that our systems\n\n38\n00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.270\nare configured properly and functioning\nthe way that we think they should be.\n\n39\n00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.143\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's kind of an unusual standard, right?\n\n40\n00:02:15.143 --> 00:02:19.000\nWhen you measure everything against some\ntype of investigation that we're doing.\n\n41\n00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.780\nWe're trying to make sure that we\nset everything up for forensics.\n\n42\n00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.750\nThat's important, don't get us wrong,\n\n43\n00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.250\nbut day to day operations right\nthese are also part of something.\n\n44\n00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.790\nThat we wanna make sure that's going on\nthat's actually doing what we wanna do.\n\n45\n00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.990\nWhen we set up security policies\nwe definitely wanna make sure\n\n46\n00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.580\nthat we are configuring them to be able\nto work the way that they need to.\n\n47\n00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.949\nAnd group policies helps us to be\nable to at least sees some of that.\n\n48\n00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:48.471\nNow, when we start to do this really it\ndepend on what it is that you're willing\n\n49\n00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:51.296\nto see and\nhow much you actually need to see here.\n\n50\n00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:53.230\nSo there's a couple of different settings.\n\n51\n00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.880\nLet's go ahead and take a look inside\nof my Group Policy Management Editor.\n\n52\n00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.560\nThis is the default domain policy\nthat I have now expanded out and\n\n53\n00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.090\nopened, so that we're actually taking\na look at the editing of that.\n\n54\n00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.930\nSo let me verify that right there.\n\n55\n00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.570\nSo there is, Default Domain Policy.\n\n56\n00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.661\nAnd then I've expanded that Computer\nConfiguration on the Policies Windows, and\n\n57\n00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:17.600\nthen of course the Windows Settings,\nexcuse me.\n\n58\n00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.030\nFrom there the Security Settings,\nand then under Local Policies here.\n\n59\n00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.680\nIn our previous episode, we just finished\nlooking at user rights assignment.\n\n60\n00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.170\nSince we're talking about auditing,\nit's natural to actually take a look and\n\n61\n00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.510\nrealize right above that is\ngonna be the audit policy.\n\n62\n00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.730\nAnd I click right there, I can see\ninside the details of that policy.\n\n63\n00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.090\nThere are nine different categories of\nsettings that we can actually used for us.\n\n64\n00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.640\nNotice there's account audit logon events,\naccount management,\n\n65\n00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.140\ndirectory service access,\nwhich I can't say, audit logon,\n\n66\n00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.000\nand then as it goes on, yes,\nyou see there's several of them here.\n\n67\n00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.050\nNow we're not going super in depth in\nterms of the combination of these things.\n\n68\n00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.890\nAs you go on towards your MCSA,\n\n69\n00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.480\nyou'll actually be able to kind of\nsee what each of these things do.\n\n70\n00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.330\nSo some of them do sound similar, right?\n\n71\n00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.170\nSo if we take a look at this, and\n\n72\n00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.810\nnotice right here one says\naudit account logon events.\n\n73\n00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.000\nAnd then another one just\nsays audit logon events.\n\n74\n00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.450\nSo even that can be a little bit\nconfusing, but we're not really worried\n\n75\n00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.700\nabout jumping into those and describing\nwhat those are all about right now.\n\n76\n00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.970\nBut what I really want you to see,\nand I'll show a couple of these so\n\n77\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.200\nthat you can see this,\nis that if I select let's say this one.\n\n78\n00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.665\nYou'll notice that the policy itself is\nnot really defined in much depth at all.\n\n79\n00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:46.640\nOkay, so for example, if I want to\nimplement this I define these policy\n\n80\n00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.973\nsettings that I'm putting a check mark.\n\n81\n00:04:48.973 --> 00:04:53.930\nAnd when I do an auditing,\nnotice it says audit these attempts.\n\n82\n00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.040\nSo I can actually say that on\nthe account logon events, I want to\n\n83\n00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.360\nknow when somebody's account logon is\nsuccessful, okay, so that makes sense.\n\n84\n00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.360\nOr I can uncheck it and\nthen I want to actually be notified\n\n85\n00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.500\nBy this audit here and\nactually send me some type of event here.\n\n86\n00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.130\nThat tells me when it's failed.\n\n87\n00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.770\nOr I can choose to do both if I want to.\n\n88\n00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.260\nBut notice that there's\nreally nothing else\n\n89\n00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.080\non this big gigantic dialog box here\nexcept for the word Apply and OK.\n\n90\n00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.690\nIt really isn't anything spectacular as\nfar as what this event tells us, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.810\nNow, if we go on and\n\n92\n00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.450\nlet's just take a look at something\na little bit different here, right?\n\n93\n00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.600\nNotice the audit object access, and\nthis is a very important one as well.\n\n94\n00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.330\nWhich says hey,\nyou've got access to something, right?\n\n95\n00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.610\nBut look,\nit looks almost like a cookie cutter.\n\n96\n00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.580\nNotice that we're still\nseeing the same things.\n\n97\n00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.960\nWe're either making sure that we know that\nsomebody's actually been successful at\n\n98\n00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.560\ngetting access to this, or they failed,\nor we can do a combination of both, okay.\n\n99\n00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.330\nSo that's what we're starting to see.\n\n100\n00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.007\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and by looking at those it is\nkind of interesting that they give you\n\n101\n00:06:03.007 --> 00:06:05.318\nthe option to select either, or, and both.\n\n102\n00:06:05.318 --> 00:06:07.728\nAlthough it's only three settings here,\nbut\n\n103\n00:06:07.728 --> 00:06:11.866\nit's not like really one of those two\noptions is more important than the other,\n\n104\n00:06:11.866 --> 00:06:14.296\nso you might want to go ahead and\nselect both.\n\n105\n00:06:14.296 --> 00:06:16.285\nBecause those successful,\n\n106\n00:06:16.285 --> 00:06:20.070\nthose failed logins can tell you just as\nmuch as the successful ones can right?\n\n107\n00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.750\n&gt;&gt; Right, and again it all depends\non your security context and\n\n108\n00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.760\nwhat it is that you're\nreally looking to do, okay?\n\n109\n00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.160\nIf you're trying to make sure, let's take\nfor an example that there is something\n\n110\n00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.350\nthat only a certain group of\npeople can access certain objects.\n\n111\n00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.750\nWhat you may want to take a look at, who\nis actually not successful at logging in.\n\n112\n00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.390\nSo in other words you know who should be\nlogging in, but you not really caring\n\n113\n00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.880\nif anybody else is logging in but\nyou wanna see who attempts it.\n\n114\n00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.910\nSo maybe just auditing those\nfailures will actually help instead.\n\n115\n00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.450\nBut you can actually take\na look at both if you chose to.\n\n116\n00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.990\nNow you might be saying Ronnie,\nwhy would you do one or the other,\n\n117\n00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.920\nif you can actually do both?\n\n118\n00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.290\nWell, remember that even\nthough this is small,\n\n119\n00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.390\nthere's also other settings that\nwe might have put in place.\n\n120\n00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.720\nNot just with this auditing, but with\nall the other options that we have here,\n\n121\n00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.650\nand available for us.\n\n122\n00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:12.970\nAll of these, after a while,\n\n123\n00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.090\nthey can generate a little bit\nof volume on your computer.\n\n124\n00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.920\nTo where you have to consider space.\n\n125\n00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.660\nNow, on a single machine in lab\nenvironment, I'm not gonna generate enough\n\n126\n00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:29.190\nto actually really impact the overall\nvolume of the drive that I have.\n\n127\n00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.208\nBut maybe in a real production\nenvironment, if I have a very active\n\n128\n00:07:33.208 --> 00:07:38.043\nnetwork, and everybody's accessing this\none particular object that I have.\n\n129\n00:07:38.043 --> 00:07:42.011\nSuch as an application or a folder,\nwhatever it might be, well that might\n\n130\n00:07:42.011 --> 00:07:46.800\ngenerate so much more traffic that each\nof these logs begins to add up in volume.\n\n131\n00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.660\nSo do make a consideration also for\nspace, so instead of actually doing both,\n\n132\n00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.007\nyou're actually gonna say,\nlet me just audit these instead.\n\n133\n00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:56.142\nSo it really does depend on the context.\n\n134\n00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.899\nNow the reason why I also\nwanted to show this, right?\n\n135\n00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:02.979\nIs that you're starting to sizzling\nthat That sounds like a real\n\n136\n00:08:02.979 --> 00:08:04.273\naudit of some sort.\n\n137\n00:08:04.273 --> 00:08:08.108\nRonnie, at the beginning, you were saying\nyou can find out when an event started.\n\n138\n00:08:08.108 --> 00:08:10.751\nYou could find out how long\nan event actually goes on,\n\n139\n00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:12.583\nwhen it actually possible stopped.\n\n140\n00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:15.210\nYou noted something like that, right?\n\n141\n00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.740\nYou can actually find all this stuff out.\n\n142\n00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.779\nWell it actually, you can,\nbut not through here, okay?\n\n143\n00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:25.051\nSo this is where it's a little\nbit more tricky, right?\n\n144\n00:08:25.051 --> 00:08:27.741\nNormally this is the first\nplace that we are introduced,\n\n145\n00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:29.890\nespecially when we go into the MCSA.\n\n146\n00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.430\nWe start to take a look at these\naudit policies right here.\n\n147\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:37.720\nBut they are very blocky,\nthey are very categorical in what they do.\n\n148\n00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:42.020\nThey are not as fine grained\nas we would expect them to be.\n\n149\n00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.317\nBut we do have that ability, like we\nalso saw with the password policies.\n\n150\n00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:49.375\nWhere we can get a little bit\nmore fine grained as well,\n\n151\n00:08:49.375 --> 00:08:53.740\nto be able to actually do much more\nthan what we just showed you here.\n\n152\n00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.390\nSo let's take a look at that aspect too.\n\n153\n00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:00.642\nNow, unlike the fine grain password\npolicies, where we can set all that\n\n154\n00:09:00.642 --> 00:09:04.488\nup along with the account policies\nall together in one location.\n\n155\n00:09:04.488 --> 00:09:09.079\nIf we're gonna remain right here inside\nof the group policy settings, and what\n\n156\n00:09:09.079 --> 00:09:13.688\nwe'll notice is, over here on the left\nhand side, as we continue to navigate.\n\n157\n00:09:13.688 --> 00:09:19.779\nWe will also, as we scroll down, you'll\nsee something else right here at the end,\n\n158\n00:09:19.779 --> 00:09:23.709\nwhere it says\nAdvanced Audit Policy Configuration.\n\n159\n00:09:23.709 --> 00:09:28.280\nAnd this is where we get more fine\ngrained opportunities to actually set\n\n160\n00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.510\nauditing the way that we want to as well.\n\n161\n00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:35.168\nSo when we start to take a look\nat the Advanced Audit Policies.\n\n162\n00:09:35.168 --> 00:09:39.107\nThese are gonna be much more granular\nin their nature than simply giving us\n\n163\n00:09:39.107 --> 00:09:42.990\nthe ability to say, all right,\nsomebody accessed something.\n\n164\n00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.765\nSomebody was able to logon\nsuccessfully whatever it might be,\n\n165\n00:09:46.765 --> 00:09:49.710\nao that is what we wanna take a look at.\n\n166\n00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.339\nIf I click on this little right pointing\narrow here on the left hand side.\n\n167\n00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:58.150\nI expand that out and\nnotice it has a nice little icon here,\n\n168\n00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:02.520\nAudit Policies, and I click on that and\nI expand that down.\n\n169\n00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:07.820\nNow I can go into the details pane and\nsee some of the other information.\n\n170\n00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.450\nLet's go ahead and take a look at\nwhat it says as we get started with\n\n171\n00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.442\nthe Advanced Audit Policies here.\n\n172\n00:10:13.442 --> 00:10:18.221\nAdvanced Audit Configuration or Advanced\nAudit Policy Configuration settings can be\n\n173\n00:10:18.221 --> 00:10:21.305\nused to provide detailed\ncontrol over audit policies.\n\n174\n00:10:21.305 --> 00:10:24.957\nIdentify attempted or\nsuccessful attacks on your network and\n\n175\n00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:29.380\nresources, and verify compliance with\nrules governing the management of\n\n176\n00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.970\ncritical organizational assets.\n\n177\n00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.030\nSo when we start seeing this, you actually\nnotice that there is a bunch of these\n\n178\n00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.990\ncategories down here and\nnone of them are actually configured.\n\n179\n00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:40.846\nBut this does give us a little\nmore fine grained and\n\n180\n00:10:40.846 --> 00:10:44.790\nmore detailed information that we\ncan have with auto policies rather\n\n181\n00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:49.284\nthan the general categories that we have\nright here, is what we take a look at.\n\n182\n00:10:49.284 --> 00:10:52.039\nSo if I go ahead and now I zoom back out,\n\n183\n00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:56.189\nI can now see that the Audit\nolicies are now expanded out.\n\n184\n00:10:56.189 --> 00:10:59.653\nAnd they are listed underneath,\nand it does look fairly similar.\n\n185\n00:10:59.653 --> 00:11:03.700\nSome of these, it does look that way, but\nwhat you're actually gonna see is that\n\n186\n00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.036\nhere when they talk about\nthe more fine grain.\n\n187\n00:11:06.036 --> 00:11:09.009\nThis is stuff that happens in\nthe background that you and\n\n188\n00:11:09.009 --> 00:11:11.710\nI don't actually know\nabout a lot of times.\n\n189\n00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.830\nSo let me give you a for\ninstance here that I'm talking about.\n\n190\n00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:18.465\nIf I go ahead and\nexpand out let's say Account Logon, and\n\n191\n00:11:18.465 --> 00:11:22.805\nlet me see if I can zoom in actually\nthat's not the one that I wanted.\n\n192\n00:11:22.805 --> 00:11:26.304\nThe one I wanted is Logon Logoff,\nI don't know why I selected Account Logon.\n\n193\n00:11:26.304 --> 00:11:30.963\nBut let's say that Logon Logoff,\nnow noticed that we have\n\n194\n00:11:30.963 --> 00:11:35.826\nmuch more granular details over\nhere on the right hand side.\n\n195\n00:11:35.826 --> 00:11:40.211\nSo it's not just we picked one\npolicy like what we saw earlier,\n\n196\n00:11:40.211 --> 00:11:43.203\nwhere it was Account Logon event, right?\n\n197\n00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:45.703\nWell now just says Audit Logon.\n\n198\n00:11:45.703 --> 00:11:50.100\nNow notice all the things that\nyou can actually end up doing.\n\n199\n00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.236\nNow if I select Audit Logon and\nI double-click on this,\n\n200\n00:11:54.236 --> 00:11:59.345\nyou're gonna notice that now,\nRonnie that looks exactly the same.\n\n201\n00:11:59.345 --> 00:12:03.494\nThere's not a lot of detail you know\nthat we actually have available to us.\n\n202\n00:12:03.494 --> 00:12:06.905\nBut when we select it from here and\nwe can figure these events,\n\n203\n00:12:06.905 --> 00:12:09.540\nit we actually chooses\nto do both from example.\n\n204\n00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.848\nAnd I do this,\nwere I can figure this audit event.\n\n205\n00:12:12.848 --> 00:12:18.280\nWhat is gonna happen, is this gonna\nactually give me additional information\n\n206\n00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.440\nsuch as when a user signs in and\nsigns out.\n\n207\n00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.640\nSo it will actually give me that\ninformation, it will even tell me what\n\n208\n00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:32.070\ncomputer was used and the date and time\nthat this actually did end up occurring.\n\n209\n00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:36.080\nSo there is much more information\nin just a simple tick\n\n210\n00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:41.280\nthat somebody successfully logged on or\nsomebody didn't successfully log on.\n\n211\n00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.384\nSo that's an example of how\ninformation that even though you and\n\n212\n00:12:45.384 --> 00:12:47.056\nI don't see a lot of that,\n\n213\n00:12:47.056 --> 00:12:51.394\nyou actually have more information\nright here of what will happen.\n\n214\n00:12:51.394 --> 00:12:54.875\nSo if you wanna take a look, we're not\ngonna read every one of this to you.\n\n215\n00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:58.198\nBut it will show you some of\nthe other things that it does,\n\n216\n00:12:58.198 --> 00:13:01.531\nand that's why we actually,\nwanna use this, if we can.\n\n217\n00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:05.790\nBecause it gives us much more detail,\nto who can do better analysis with it too.\n\n218\n00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.612\n&gt;&gt; All right, so this is one way we can\ngo ahead and control those settings, and\n\n219\n00:13:09.612 --> 00:13:11.664\nyou showed us also about our passwords.\n\n220\n00:13:11.664 --> 00:13:15.842\nBut when we're talking about controlling\nthat environment, is there anything that\n\n221\n00:13:15.842 --> 00:13:19.742\nwe should consider that we should really\nrestrict or applied group policy too?\n\n222\n00:13:19.742 --> 00:13:22.823\nSo that our end users\naren't modifying things and\n\n223\n00:13:22.823 --> 00:13:26.429\nkind of having too many cooks\nin the kitchen, so to speak.\n\n224\n00:13:26.429 --> 00:13:27.857\n&gt;&gt; Well with the auditing, right?\n\n225\n00:13:27.857 --> 00:13:28.652\nThere's really not.\n\n226\n00:13:28.652 --> 00:13:31.719\nIt really depends on what it\nis you need to audit, and\n\n227\n00:13:31.719 --> 00:13:34.950\nthis comes back down to\nyour security policies.\n\n228\n00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:39.160\nAre you really only auditing for\nthings that are super sensitive or\n\n229\n00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:44.100\nmission critical items or are you doing\nit for your every day desktop logins.\n\n230\n00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.479\nIt just depends on what your real need is.\n\n231\n00:13:46.479 --> 00:13:51.083\nSo those are kind of the elements or\nlogic behind that according to your\n\n232\n00:13:51.083 --> 00:13:54.460\nsecurity policy is where\nyou would do that.\n\n233\n00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.540\nBut there are some of these events\nthat will help you out especially with\n\n234\n00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.710\nsomething like this.\n\n235\n00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.840\nThere's a couple more we\nalso want to point out to.\n\n236\n00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.413\nSo another one of course is, let me\nscroll back over to the left hand side.\n\n237\n00:14:06.413 --> 00:14:10.235\nAnd here under DS Access,\nwhich means directory service access,\n\n238\n00:14:10.235 --> 00:14:13.670\nthat's another one we wanna\ntake a look at as well.\n\n239\n00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:18.172\nSo here under directory service access,\nif we take a look at the computer screen,\n\n240\n00:14:18.172 --> 00:14:20.275\nthat will also help us out too, okay?\n\n241\n00:14:20.275 --> 00:14:23.174\nSo now that I've got that showing up,\n\n242\n00:14:23.174 --> 00:14:27.170\nI take a look at directory\nservice access by itself.\n\n243\n00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:31.483\nWell this is where I can also\nfind out if I select this one and\n\n244\n00:14:31.483 --> 00:14:35.930\njust simply turn it on and\ndo those check marks there.\n\n245\n00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:41.396\nThis is one of those settings that allows\nme to be able to track the creation\n\n246\n00:14:41.396 --> 00:14:46.080\nas well as the deletion of objects\ninside of Active Directory.\n\n247\n00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:51.913\nSo it gives me not only who, but also\nwhen something also occurred which can\n\n248\n00:14:51.913 --> 00:14:58.315\nhelp me track down when things happen and\nwho might have caused it as they did that.\n\n249\n00:14:58.315 --> 00:15:01.801\nSo much more detailed is what\nwe are seeing there, and\n\n250\n00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:06.150\nmuch more effective information\nto do this as well, okay?\n\n251\n00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:11.386\nNow the other one is under Object Access\nthat we also want to take a look at here.\n\n252\n00:15:11.386 --> 00:15:17.854\nAnd then from this one Audit File Share,\nso that's actually a little bit unusual.\n\n253\n00:15:17.854 --> 00:15:22.370\nActually Audit File System, make sure I'm\ntelling you right again, right one here.\n\n254\n00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.246\nIn the Audit File System,\n\n255\n00:15:24.246 --> 00:15:29.376\nwe can actually find out what was\nactually seen by other people, okay?\n\n256\n00:15:29.376 --> 00:15:35.409\nWe can look at all of these successful or\nunsuccessful, what am I saying?\n\n257\n00:15:35.409 --> 00:15:38.957\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Unsuccessful attempts add accessing\n\n258\n00:15:38.957 --> 00:15:39.651\nfiles.\n\n259\n00:15:39.651 --> 00:15:42.480\nNow that's actually a good thing, right?\n\n260\n00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.340\nIf we know that people aren't supposed\nto be accessing certain things.\n\n261\n00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.079\n&gt;&gt; Especially if you see multiple\nfailed attempts, then you're like hey,\n\n262\n00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:50.920\nsomeone's trying to get into this\ninformation that really shouldn't be.\n\n263\n00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.671\nAnd that should cause some\nkind of alert or alarm there.\n\n264\n00:15:54.671 --> 00:15:58.183\n&gt;&gt; And so it's right here were\nthis is really a good thing,\n\n265\n00:15:58.183 --> 00:16:02.760\nWhere it does give you a little bit\nmore information to be able to do that.\n\n266\n00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:08.358\nThe other one, of course along with this\none, I'll make sure I'm telling you right,\n\n267\n00:16:08.358 --> 00:16:10.247\nas well, is gonna be under System.\n\n268\n00:16:10.247 --> 00:16:14.731\nSo, let me scroll down and\nchange our context here into System.\n\n269\n00:16:14.731 --> 00:16:20.108\nAnd underneath system here, the one that\nwe want is Audit Security State Change\n\n270\n00:16:20.108 --> 00:16:24.120\nhere, so\nI'm not actually seeing that over here.\n\n271\n00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.160\nThere it is, I was gonna say\nAudit Security State Change.\n\n272\n00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.800\nAnd the Audit Security State Change one,\nthat we actually end up seeing.\n\n273\n00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.710\nThis actually gives us a look at\nthe date and time every computer, okay,\n\n274\n00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:40.870\nthat we choose to audit this on\nwhat shut down or started up, okay.\n\n275\n00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.680\nNow that doesn't sound really\nlike anything gigantic.\n\n276\n00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.120\nWhat's the big deal?\n\n277\n00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.870\nWe reboot our computers once a day.\n\n278\n00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.790\nWhy do I really care?\n\n279\n00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:54.160\nThis is one where it might not be\nsomething that you're really monitoring\n\n280\n00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.880\nlike desktop computers.\n\n281\n00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.180\nBut what about those mission\ncritical computers like your domain\n\n282\n00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.580\ncontrollers, right?\n\n283\n00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:05.533\nYou want to know when something like this\nhappens so that you can actually track it.\n\n284\n00:17:05.533 --> 00:17:07.112\n&gt;&gt; Investigate it, yeah.\n\n285\n00:17:07.112 --> 00:17:10.490\n&gt;&gt; Instead of you just come and\ngo, that thing was restarted.\n\n286\n00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.890\nAnd you know how you actually see\nthat it's restarted, you log in and\n\n287\n00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.250\nit tells you unexpected, you know.\n\n288\n00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:18.680\nIt gives you that little menu that says,\nhey, this was unexpected.\n\n289\n00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.940\nOkay, and\nyou kind of don't go any further.\n\n290\n00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.750\nBut you did have this alert\nthat let you know, and\n\n291\n00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.940\nwhat if you see a multiple\nseries of those?\n\n292\n00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:32.120\nThat might lead you to actually go on and\ninvestigate, is this a power supply issue?\n\n293\n00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:32.996\n&gt;&gt; Hardware failure?\n\n294\n00:17:32.996 --> 00:17:33.916\n&gt;&gt; Hardware failure,\nsomething might be happening.\n\n295\n00:17:33.916 --> 00:17:37.956\n&gt;&gt; Someone trying to\ngain unauthorized access.\n\n296\n00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:42.124\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so all of those events\nare actually very possible when we\n\n297\n00:17:42.124 --> 00:17:46.690\nstart to take a look at the idea\nof the audit that we see, okay.\n\n298\n00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:51.320\nSo in terms of auditing, those\nare actually very important processes for\n\n299\n00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:55.450\nus as we start to take a look at\nsome of those settings inside.\n\n300\n00:17:55.450 --> 00:18:00.670\nNow, that means that we actually have one\nmore category to cover which is gonna\n\n301\n00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:05.673\nbe taking a look at configuring our\nWindows Firewall with group policy to.\n\n302\n00:18:05.673 --> 00:18:08.507\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie we have seen how\nwe can really lock down a lot of these\n\n303\n00:18:08.507 --> 00:18:10.970\ncomponents but\nwhat about our Windows Firewall?\n\n304\n00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:15.020\nWhy would we choose to use group\npolicy to go ahead and restrict or\n\n305\n00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.980\nconfigure Windows Firewall?\n\n306\n00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:20.830\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's actually a great\nquestion because you go no,\n\n307\n00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.980\nwhy would you ever do something like that?\n\n308\n00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:29.030\nBut remember that there are times\nwhen people will end up changing\n\n309\n00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:34.310\ntheir firewall settings and\nthe reason why they do that,\n\n310\n00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:38.385\nCherokee is relatively, it's from good.\n\n311\n00:18:38.385 --> 00:18:40.413\nI'm trying to think of\na diplomatic way to say this.\n\n312\n00:18:40.413 --> 00:18:41.535\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n313\n00:18:41.535 --> 00:18:43.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The idea is simple, right.\n\n314\n00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:46.310\nIs that they hear what they\nbelieve is good advice from\n\n315\n00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.430\nthe person sitting right next to them.\n\n316\n00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:49.735\nJust turn off the Windows Firewall.\n\n317\n00:18:49.735 --> 00:18:53.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and then,\nthey're like, really?\n\n318\n00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.070\nYeah, it won't harm anything.\n\n319\n00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.790\nJust turn it off.\n\n320\n00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:58.280\n&gt;&gt; I read it on the Internet,\nso it must be true.\n\n321\n00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I read it on the Internet,\n\n322\n00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:03.500\nit must be true but normally it's from\na well-intentioned person that said,\n\n323\n00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.430\nwhen they hear,\nI can't get this connection going.\n\n324\n00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.440\nAnd they just go, yeah,\njust turn off the Windows Firewall.\n\n325\n00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.280\n&gt;&gt; It'll work then.\n\n326\n00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.871\n&gt;&gt; It'll work [LAUGH] you know?\n\n327\n00:19:11.871 --> 00:19:12.663\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n328\n00:19:12.663 --> 00:19:15.570\nthen when it doesn't work they're like,\nI'm kind of stumped.\n\n329\n00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:18.040\nYou'll probably have to\ncall support to help us,\n\n330\n00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:22.110\nand as well intentioned as those\npeople are that recommend them turning\n\n331\n00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:25.820\noff the windows firewall\nits not a good thing right.\n\n332\n00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:31.160\nSo instead if we can implement this\nthrough group policy not only for\n\n333\n00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.580\nthe individual desktop computer but\neven for Windows servers right.\n\n334\n00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.130\nWhere somebody doesn't just turn\noff the firewall just to verify,\n\n335\n00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:42.420\nnow, inside of a lab setting,\nyeah, you better believe it.\n\n336\n00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.090\nIt's the easiest thing to do.\n\n337\n00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.207\nBut in a real production network,\n\n338\n00:19:46.207 --> 00:19:50.952\nturning off the firewall itself inside\nthe Windows Firewall can have unusual\n\n339\n00:19:50.952 --> 00:19:54.167\nconsequences at times that\nyou don't think about.\n\n340\n00:19:54.167 --> 00:19:57.632\nAnd I know that it's not only about\nthe malicious software that gets on\n\n341\n00:19:57.632 --> 00:20:00.930\nthe computer but it's about\nviolating security policy, right?\n\n342\n00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:04.260\nAnd that's really kinda the key here,\nis that we don't want that to happened.\n\n343\n00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:08.040\nSo being able to set this up in\ngroup policy, essentially does what?\n\n344\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.540\nFor the end user,\nwhoever tries to go and turn it off,\n\n345\n00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.900\nthey get what grayed out settings and\nthat's what we really want to do.\n\n346\n00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:18.060\nSo that's probably why we would choose to\ndo something like this, when we do this.\n\n347\n00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:21.320\nNow, whenever we also do this,\nwe've gotta remember that, you know,\n\n348\n00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:26.090\nfor us, it's gonna really revolve\naround two primary goals of setting up\n\n349\n00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.660\nWindows Firewall to help us do this.\n\n350\n00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:32.370\nOne of course, is just to enable it,\nand that way, nobody turns it off.\n\n351\n00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.530\nOkay?\nI know that that sounds silly,\n\n352\n00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:35.472\nbut it's true.\n\n353\n00:20:35.472 --> 00:20:37.552\nNormally, what I would suggest is,\n\n354\n00:20:37.552 --> 00:20:41.108\nregardless of whatever the network\nprofile is that you see, so\n\n355\n00:20:41.108 --> 00:20:45.289\nin a work setting you see domain and\nthen home or something else, work or.\n\n356\n00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:46.378\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, over the years,\n\n357\n00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:50.085\nthey've kind of changed the way that they\nworded that the concept still remain.\n\n358\n00:20:50.085 --> 00:20:54.645\nYou've got your three basic settings\ndepending on, well with like desktops,\n\n359\n00:20:54.645 --> 00:20:56.605\nyou don't really move them around right?\n\n360\n00:20:56.605 --> 00:20:57.525\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; And servers, but\n\n361\n00:20:57.525 --> 00:21:01.065\nwith laptops we see our mobile devices and\nyou've got those three different profiles\n\n362\n00:21:01.065 --> 00:21:03.965\nthat you wanna make sure that it's on for\nall three.\n\n363\n00:21:03.965 --> 00:21:07.595\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's actually a great\nthing because it means regardless of what\n\n364\n00:21:07.595 --> 00:21:10.720\nnetwork you get switched to you know\nthat the firewall setting's on.\n\n365\n00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.470\nSo my recommendation is that\nthat way it actually is on,\n\n366\n00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:17.320\nsomebody doesn't turn it off for\nhome and then have it on in the office.\n\n367\n00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.590\nBeing able to set that up is actually one\nof the first things that you want to do\n\n368\n00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:22.640\nas well.\n\n369\n00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.160\nBeing able to configure notifications\nis another one that you want,\n\n370\n00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.540\nwhen somebody actually does get\nsomething and they're blocked.\n\n371\n00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.350\nSo if for one reason or another\nthe firewall is the issue then you get\n\n372\n00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:38.940\na notification about it and then you\ncan even do some configurations inside\n\n373\n00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.080\nto help you if traffic is\nactually being dropped.\n\n374\n00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.510\nAnd of course also being\nable to set up IP setup.\n\n375\n00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.560\nYou can't do it without\nthe Windows Firewall and\n\n376\n00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.090\nthat's actually required of you.\n\n377\n00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.760\nIt needs to be on as well.\n\n378\n00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.900\nThe second goal is simple,\n\n379\n00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.500\njust to make sure that the rules\nare managed the way that they need to.\n\n380\n00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.450\nAnd in the Windows Firewall,\n\n381\n00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:59.270\nright, you have the ability to manage\ninbound as well as outbound traffic.\n\n382\n00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:03.440\nSo that is a good thing for\nus to make sure that we can actually do.\n\n383\n00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.667\nSo of course, that means we're gonna take\na look briefly at some of these settings.\n\n384\n00:22:06.667 --> 00:22:10.463\nWe're not gonna configure them all, but\nJust to make sure that you actually\n\n385\n00:22:10.463 --> 00:22:14.760\nunderstand where you are normally going\nto, if this is what ends up happening.\n\n386\n00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.690\nSo, I'm just scrolling up here and\nwhat we want to do\n\n387\n00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:20.490\nis underneath our computer configurations,\nwhich we are already in and\n\n388\n00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:25.162\nunderneath Policies and Windows settings,\nwe're already expending out all of that.\n\n389\n00:22:25.162 --> 00:22:29.020\nWhat we're looking for, of course,\nis going to be the Windows Firewall.\n\n390\n00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.280\nNow, I see it right here.\n\n391\n00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:34.420\nI'm trying to make sure I'm eyeballing it\ncorrectly because it's relatively small,\n\n392\n00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:41.350\nmake sure your covering there it is\nWindows Firewall with Advance Security so\n\n393\n00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.160\nyou could see that one right there.\n\n394\n00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.340\nI spend that out and\n\n395\n00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:49.370\nI click on this you'll gonna notice\nsomething that this is one is interactive,\n\n396\n00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:54.190\nit really does look like the same\nsettings firewall that open up directly.\n\n397\n00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.750\nYou'd actually see these kind of things.\n\n398\n00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.210\nSo there's the three domain\nprofiles on this particular\n\n399\n00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:02.210\ninstance that we're actually seeing.\n\n400\n00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:06.740\nSo here domain, private, whatever,\nnotice it says it's not configured,\n\n401\n00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.180\nwell you can go in here and\nthen configure those properties\n\n402\n00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:14.160\nto be able to make sure that it's\nactually on or off or not configured.\n\n403\n00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.940\nNow the reason why this one's not\nconfigured is cuz I'm not managing it\n\n404\n00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.340\nthrough group policy.\n\n405\n00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.360\nBut if you were to,\n\n406\n00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.400\nthis is where you would go to\ndo the domain, private profile,\n\n407\n00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.390\npublic profile, and even on the IP set\ndefaults you can actually change that.\n\n408\n00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:32.800\nSo those are some of the things probably\nat the minimum and not the basic.\n\n409\n00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.880\nIf I knew that people were\nturning off the firewall,\n\n410\n00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.890\nI would probably at least set that.\n\n411\n00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:41.260\nI may not set all the other things here,\nbut I may at least set that.\n\n412\n00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.714\nNow, the other ones of course\nmight be right here on creating\n\n413\n00:23:44.714 --> 00:23:47.096\nthese firewall rules and managing them.\n\n414\n00:23:47.096 --> 00:23:51.110\nOutbound rules by default,\nit allows everything to travel outbound.\n\n415\n00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:54.230\nWhat you're really worried about\nthe majority of the time is right here\n\n416\n00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.958\nunder inbound.\n\n417\n00:23:54.958 --> 00:23:59.438\nWhat is allowed to get in to your\ncomputer and you might think well,\n\n418\n00:23:59.438 --> 00:24:03.520\nmy network has a firewall at the edge,\nwhy do I care?\n\n419\n00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.140\nWell, if your network is more\nopen than you think it is,\n\n420\n00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.230\nin other words you have vendors that\ncome on to your network that you give\n\n421\n00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:14.150\nthem access to your wireless network\neven though you don't think that you do.\n\n422\n00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:15.100\n&gt;&gt; They're already behind that firewall.\n\n423\n00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.820\n&gt;&gt; Somebody's already behind the firewall.\n\n424\n00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.531\nSomebody plugs in their own home laptop,\nthey're ready behind the firewall.\n\n425\n00:24:20.531 --> 00:24:22.783\nYou wanna make sure that\nthese come in and, or\n\n426\n00:24:22.783 --> 00:24:26.518\nthese come into play when you have\nInbound Rules that says reject any of this\n\n427\n00:24:26.518 --> 00:24:29.950\ntraffic even though it's already\nbehind another firewall.\n\n428\n00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.320\nIf it comes in even from the same network,\ngo on and do that.\n\n429\n00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:37.500\nSo the Windows firewall really does act\nlike an intrusion prevention system,\n\n430\n00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.540\na host based intrusion\nprevention system for\n\n431\n00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:43.110\nus that works relatively effectively,\nright.\n\n432\n00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:44.970\nIf we actually do use them.\n\n433\n00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:48.279\nSo do take a look,\nlet me just click on this Inbound Rules so\n\n434\n00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:51.737\nthat we can see here just for\na moment there is nothing shown.\n\n435\n00:24:51.737 --> 00:24:56.010\nSo I wanna create one, I just simply\nright click on the Inbound Rule,\n\n436\n00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:57.200\nselect a New Rule.\n\n437\n00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.937\nAnd now you'll see that it's the same\nwizard that you walked through based on\n\n438\n00:25:00.937 --> 00:25:03.940\nprogram, port, something defined,\nor even a custom rule.\n\n439\n00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.580\nAnd you go through, and you create these\ntypes of rules to help you out, okay?\n\n440\n00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.700\nSo that's the same thing that you'll\nsee with the outbound rules as well,\n\n441\n00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.840\nsame utility, and\nyou'll be able to configure those.\n\n442\n00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.670\nDon't overdo it,\nbecause you have a security policy\n\n443\n00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.950\nthat's in place that tells you,\nwhat you can do, what you can't do.\n\n444\n00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:27.050\nJust make sure you follow that\npolicy as you set this thing up.\n\n445\n00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:30.070\nBut the primary reason\nagain is accidentally,\n\n446\n00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:32.240\nor again I won't say accidentally.\n\n447\n00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:37.870\nSomebody believes helpful, well intended\nperson that says let's just do this.\n\n448\n00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:39.560\nAnd if you're like me,\nright, you're forgetful.\n\n449\n00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.774\nAnd when you're doing it for\n\n450\n00:25:40.774 --> 00:25:43.107\ntesting though,\nI'll turn this thing right back on.\n\n451\n00:25:43.107 --> 00:25:47.340\n10 minutes later I'd forgotten that\nI even messed with the firewall.\n\n452\n00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.820\nSo that's never a good thing.\n\n453\n00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.720\nIf you really inside of\na production network\n\n454\n00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.780\nthis is something that may\nactually help you out tremendously\n\n455\n00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.100\nwhen you're starting to see unusual\nsettings across your network like that.\n\n456\n00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:03.050\nWhereas something that you don't want to\nhappen, so do pay attention there and\n\n457\n00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:05.995\nall of these will help secure\nyour computing environment.\n\n458\n00:26:05.995 --> 00:26:09.140\nMuch better using group\npolicy much more effectively.\n\n459\n00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:10.740\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie, thank you for\ntaking the time.\n\n460\n00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:15.530\nI know we rounded out a whole\nthree 30 minute episodes there for\n\n461\n00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:16.980\ndifferent types of group policy.\n\n462\n00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.100\nThere's always a lot to learn when\nwe're working with group policy, so\n\n463\n00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.280\nthank you for that.\n\n464\n00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.930\nAnd thank you for joining us, but\n\n465\n00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.510\nstay tuned we have more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n466\n00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.090\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n467\n00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:28.900\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n468\n00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:29.760\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n469\n00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.039\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at

--> 00:00:28.869\nCherokee welcome back to the studios.\n\n11\n00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.587\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me Ronnie,\nhow is it going?\n\n12\n00:00:30.587 --> 00:00:31.469\n&gt;&gt; It is going well.\n\n13\n00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:35.855\nSo, Cherokee, when we first start\ntalking about the idea of local storage,\n\n14\n00:00:35.855 --> 00:00:37.980\nthis may be a little bit confusing.\n\n15\n00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.790\nMost of us if we've been at\nthe desktop technician level,\n\n16\n00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.170\nwe really talk about hard drives.\n\n17\n00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.410\nWhat are we normally talking about when we\nstart moving in server and local storage?\n\n18\n00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.230\n&gt;&gt; So here's the thing, Microsoft really\ndoes have a lot of information for\n\n19\n00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.190\nus to think about here.\n\n20\n00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.270\nThere's lots of layers of complexity when\nyou're talking about server side storage.\n\n21\n00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.810\nSo I'm gonna try to break it down for\nyou as much as I can.\n\n22\n00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.220\nI wouldn't get to hung up\non all the terminology.\n\n23\n00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.768\nI'll tell you which ones I would\nnot worry about so much and\n\n24\n00:01:03.768 --> 00:01:05.333\nwhich ones you should worry about.\n\n25\n00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.893\nBecause a lot of times,\neven in the industry, Ronnie,\n\n26\n00:01:07.893 --> 00:01:10.835\nyou'll hear terms that people,\njust depending on who you are or\n\n27\n00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:14.392\nwhat background you came from,\nthey might call things slightly different.\n\n28\n00:01:14.392 --> 00:01:18.874\nAnd the way that Microsoft even\nshows things within the interface,\n\n29\n00:01:18.874 --> 00:01:23.433\nthey sometimes are slight details\nbetween the names that people will\n\n30\n00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:25.870\nunderstand what you're saying.\n\n31\n00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.720\nSo, the first concept that I wanna\nconvey here is the difference between\n\n32\n00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.400\na physical disc versus a virtual disc.\n\n33\n00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.600\nSo here is the thing, a physical disc is\na disk that you can hold, it's tangible.\n\n34\n00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.730\nAnd a virtual disc is going to\nbe software based either VHD or\n\n35\n00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.300\nVHDX, if we're in a Windows environment,\nthose are gonna be the file extensions for\n\n36\n00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.160\nthat type of intangible disk, all right?\n\n37\n00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.240\nAnd you also don't wanna get that confused\nwith, there's a wizard whenever we're\n\n38\n00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.590\nworking, and we'll get to this part here,\nbut we'll be working in storage pools, and\n\n39\n00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.420\nthey also call it a virtual disk\nonce you create a contiguous or\n\n40\n00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.440\na space of disks within storage pools.\n\n41\n00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.090\nThey call that a virtual disk as well.\n\n42\n00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.550\nSo like I said,\ndon't get hung up on the details.\n\n43\n00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.090\nWe'll go ahead and\ntalk about all of those individually.\n\n44\n00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.720\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, remember that for us,\nas we get started and for you as you\n\n45\n00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.720\nstart watching this, it's easy to get hung\nup on the term physical versus virtual.\n\n46\n00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.940\nBut remember what we just\ndescribed at the show as being,\n\n47\n00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.755\nwhich is working with local storage.\n\n48\n00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:38.906\nWe're really saying it doesn't matter in\nterms of that as the way that we're gonna\n\n49\n00:02:38.906 --> 00:02:41.767\nbe managing and\nadministrating the idea of our storage.\n\n50\n00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:45.144\nWhether it's virtual or local,\nwe're gonna kinda treat it as the same.\n\n51\n00:02:45.144 --> 00:02:47.893\nSo even today,\nthe term is no longer really about\n\n52\n00:02:47.893 --> 00:02:51.070\nwhether it's a physical drive or\na virtual hard drive.\n\n53\n00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.470\nWe just call it storage today,\nis pretty much what we end up seeing.\n\n54\n00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.730\nSo, Cherokee,\nwhen we start to deal with that and\n\n55\n00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.100\nunderstand that there are differences but\nit's really not in terms of\n\n56\n00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.760\nthe administrator side of it that's really\nany different, where are we gonna begin?\n\n57\n00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.700\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna go back\nto the physical drives and\n\n58\n00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.550\nlet's start there because I have some\nconcepts that I want you to understand\n\n59\n00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.920\nin a physical sense before we move\ntowards that intangible concept.\n\n60\n00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.325\nSo if you can take a look at my screen,\nI'd like to show you something here.\n\n61\n00:03:17.325 --> 00:03:20.450\nSo we talk about a RAID, RAID stands for\n\n62\n00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.620\nRedundant Array of,\nit used to be Inexpensive Disks but\n\n63\n00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.640\na lot of times people would\njust say Independent Disks now,\n\n64\n00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.920\nbecause the cost to storage\nratio has really gone down,\n\n65\n00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.450\nso RAID, Redundant Array of Inexpensive or\nIndependent Discs.\n\n66\n00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.480\nAnd you hear the term redundant.\n\n67\n00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.220\nSo that implies that we're using\nthis concept for redundancy,\n\n68\n00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.328\nwhich most of the time we are.\n\n69\n00:03:47.328 --> 00:03:51.710\nThere are a slight instances like the\nexample that we're looking at my screen\n\n70\n00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.410\nwhere you would use it for performance\ninstead of actual redundancy here.\n\n71\n00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.180\nSo array just meaning multiple right and\nso we have multiple drives.\n\n72\n00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.920\nSo if we look at a RAID 0,\na RAID 0 you have to have at least 2 or\n\n73\n00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.080\nmore disks when we're\ntalking about a RAID 0.\n\n74\n00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.890\nThere is no redundancy here.\n\n75\n00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.440\nSo striping, there are different\nstrips sizes that you can go ahead and\n\n76\n00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.700\nconfigure, but\nlet's just say I had some data.\n\n77\n00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.006\nAnd now we're gonna be, defending\non my stripe size, I had a file and\n\n78\n00:04:26.006 --> 00:04:27.600\nI wanted to save my file.\n\n79\n00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.205\nWell, defending on\nthe size of that stripe,\n\n80\n00:04:30.205 --> 00:04:33.910\nx amount of that file would go to disk A.\n\n81\n00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.860\nLet's say this first one is A, the second\none is B, and this third disk is disk C.\n\n82\n00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.630\nSo x amount of that file would go to\ndisk A and then it would go ahead and\n\n83\n00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.650\nstripe and go through.\n\n84\n00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.570\nSo you see how it's listed here,\n1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n85\n00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.440\nAnd what that does and especially when\nwe're talking about our spindle drives,\n\n86\n00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.680\nand you think about the little actuator\nand that head that has to move back and\n\n87\n00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.290\nforth to perform those read and\nwrite functions.\n\n88\n00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.829\nYou're essentially increasing\nthe speed of those read and\n\n89\n00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:07.734\nwrite functions exponentially by\nthe number of drives you have.\n\n90\n00:05:07.734 --> 00:05:11.407\nSo at minimum you would have to have\nat least two physical drives and\n\n91\n00:05:11.407 --> 00:05:14.105\nwe really see that\nperformance increase there.\n\n92\n00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:21.335\nAnd talk about large even data centers,\nthat's where you see a huge benefit here.\n\n93\n00:05:21.335 --> 00:05:23.975\nBut note that there is no redundancy\n\n94\n00:05:23.975 --> 00:05:26.655\ninvolved with this kind\nof a configuration.\n\n95\n00:05:26.655 --> 00:05:30.700\nSo, you really have to use this\nin a situation in which you're\n\n96\n00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.890\nnot too concerned about the information\nthat's stored on these drives.\n\n97\n00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:39.250\nLet's say at a large data center, maybe\nAmazon, browsing through their catalog,\n\n98\n00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.270\nyou as an end user, you're not actually\nbrowsing through the read write\n\n99\n00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.220\ncopy of the information that\nyou see on that web page,\n\n100\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.670\nyou're just looking at a read only\ncopy of Amazon's information there.\n\n101\n00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.510\nSo if one of those drives come down\nwith some read only information,\n\n102\n00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.330\nit's not a big deal to them.\n\n103\n00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.370\nSo you just have to keep\nthat in mind there.\n\n104\n00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.590\nIf one of these drives were to fail,\nthough,\n\n105\n00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.328\nyou're gonna lose all that\ninformation because, let's just say,\n\n106\n00:06:06.328 --> 00:06:12.518\noops, If we delete all of this,\n\n107\n00:06:12.518 --> 00:06:17.710\nthat information is not,\nwhat's the word I'm looking for here?\n\n108\n00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.810\nIt does us no good, because you\ncan't fill in the blanks here and\n\n109\n00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.180\njust assume that you know what\nthe rest of that information is,\n\n110\n00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.370\nonce it's gone,\nit's gone there with RAID 0.\n\n111\n00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.900\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee,\nnow you've just introduced a concept of\n\n112\n00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.360\nthe idea of RAID and\ntrying to understand it.\n\n113\n00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.100\nHow does this go about, do I just simply\nadd another hard drive into my server and\n\n114\n00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.600\nautomatically recognizes and\ngives us RAID, or\n\n115\n00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.790\nis there some other hardware\ncomponent that I need to have set up?\n\n116\n00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's a great question, Ronnie.\n\n117\n00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.310\nAnd it really depends on, there are a lot\nof different options out there for you.\n\n118\n00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.560\nSo, that example that I was\nmentioning there with the Amazon.\n\n119\n00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.470\nSo, they are typically gonna be using\ndedicated hardware in order to ahead and\n\n120\n00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.250\nthen use a RAID configuration.\n\n121\n00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.830\nSo, for example,\n\n122\n00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.540\nyou could have like a PCI-E card,\nand it's called a RAID controller.\n\n123\n00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.140\nSo it's just like a card that\nyou'd actually put into on your\n\n124\n00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.460\nmotherboard, right?\n\n125\n00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.710\nAnd then that card will be\nhandling all of these computations\n\n126\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:19.740\ninstead of having it handled\non your computer's CPU.\n\n127\n00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.400\nNow there are motherboards that have\nintegrated chip sets that will allow you\n\n128\n00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.550\nto have an on board RAID configuration.\n\n129\n00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.410\nBut those are really more\ngeared towards the home user.\n\n130\n00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:36.060\nThey don't handle smaller size stripes.\n\n131\n00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.520\nAnd let me,\nif you can look at my screen here,\n\n132\n00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.080\nlet me just kind of\nexplain what that means.\n\n133\n00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.138\nBecause it really depends when you're\nchoosing the size of your stripe,\n\n134\n00:07:42.138 --> 00:07:44.573\nit depends on what kind of\nfiles you're gonna be storing.\n\n135\n00:07:44.573 --> 00:07:49.123\nBecause if you're choosing files that\nare smaller than you stripe size, and\n\n136\n00:07:49.123 --> 00:07:53.814\nthey go to write to each one of those\ndrives, you really won't see a performance\n\n137\n00:07:53.814 --> 00:07:58.084\nincrease if it's only gonna be Filling\nup on one drive, if this file is so\n\n138\n00:07:58.084 --> 00:08:02.448\nsmall that it only goes into one drive and\nyou don't have to spread it out.\n\n139\n00:08:02.448 --> 00:08:07.296\nSo larger organizations are probably\ngonna have the capability\n\n140\n00:08:07.296 --> 00:08:10.087\nto have really small stripes there.\n\n141\n00:08:10.087 --> 00:08:14.009\nAnd you also wanna think about single\npoints of failure because a lot of times,\n\n142\n00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:18.112\nnot in this particular one, but we'll look\nat others that are really designed for\n\n143\n00:08:18.112 --> 00:08:18.836\nredundancy.\n\n144\n00:08:18.836 --> 00:08:20.663\nAnd a lot of times companies and\n\n145\n00:08:20.663 --> 00:08:25.920\norganizations implement RAID arrays\nbecause they wanna have that redundancy.\n\n146\n00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.820\nBut if you think about, like I said, the\nPCI-E card, that's a piece of hardware.\n\n147\n00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.600\nSo that individual card could also\npose as a single point of failure.\n\n148\n00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.838\nSo in some instances,\n\n149\n00:08:35.838 --> 00:08:40.081\nyou also want to add additional RAID\ncontrollers to those additional cards.\n\n150\n00:08:40.081 --> 00:08:43.071\nAnd if you had, let's say,\ntwo RAID controller cards,\n\n151\n00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:45.637\nthen you would go ahead and\ncall that duplexing.\n\n152\n00:08:45.637 --> 00:08:49.295\nAnd there are different ways you could\nconfigured that so that if one of\n\n153\n00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:53.139\nthose were to fail you wouldn't have\nto wait to go grab another RAID card,\n\n154\n00:08:53.139 --> 00:08:54.990\nRAID controller and set that up.\n\n155\n00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.420\nAnd you could just have\nbusiness continuity and\n\n156\n00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.450\nnot have to worry about that.\n\n157\n00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.710\nBecause after all,\n\n158\n00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:03.430\nthat's really what a lot of companies are\ntrying to achieve with this configuration.\n\n159\n00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:07.367\nThere are a lot of different types\nof RAID configurations out there.\n\n160\n00:09:07.367 --> 00:09:09.740\nIn Brian's book, he only calls out three.\n\n161\n00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.060\nSo that's what we'll stick to here.\n\n162\n00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.083\nThese ones are pretty common.\n\n163\n00:09:13.083 --> 00:09:17.592\nActually, I was looking at the book and\none of his quotes he said that he's never\n\n164\n00:09:17.592 --> 00:09:22.465\nworked in an organization before where\nthey haven't actually implemented Raid 1.\n\n165\n00:09:22.465 --> 00:09:26.720\nSo let's talk about Raid 1 for\na second if we could look at my screen.\n\n166\n00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:32.550\nRaid 1 is very common and\nit is going to be mirroring, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:37.460\nSo let me jump back, I do wanna ask you\na question here, point something out.\n\n168\n00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:42.200\nWhen I look at these drives, I want you to\nunderstand, let's say each one of these\n\n169\n00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.680\ndrives with a RAID 0,\nare equivalent to one terabyte each.\n\n170\n00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.450\nI can theoretically fill up\nall of the storage space,\n\n171\n00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:55.950\nso I have three terabytes of usable\nstorage on this particular diagram, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.110\nAnd the reason I wanted to point that\nout is because if we look at a Raid 1,\n\n173\n00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:03.370\nyou lose 50% of your storage\nutilization space here.\n\n174\n00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:08.060\nBecause what you're dealing with\nis you have hard drive A, and\n\n175\n00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.380\nhard drive B is an exact replica.\n\n176\n00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.760\nSo, every time you go write\nto a particular drive here,\n\n177\n00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.990\nit's actually making an exact\nduplicate on that secondary drive.\n\n178\n00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:25.760\nNow, you're not limited to\nhaving only one extra drive.\n\n179\n00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.680\nYou can have as many as\nyour budget allows for.\n\n180\n00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:36.000\nBut just know this is somewhat of\na costly method because you're paying for\n\n181\n00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.840\ndouble the storage, but you're only\ngetting 50% of that utilization there.\n\n182\n00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:46.720\nBut the benefit here would be,\nif one of these drives were to go down,\n\n183\n00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.040\nhave a hardware failure,\nyou still have all your data intact.\n\n184\n00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.490\nSo that's probably one of\nthe reasons why it's so\n\n185\n00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:58.150\npopular, even though there's a larger\nexpense associated with that.\n\n186\n00:11:00.778 --> 00:11:04.272\nI really like this one, this is RAID 5,\nand it's kind of interesting.\n\n187\n00:11:04.272 --> 00:11:07.606\nThis was a very first RAID\nfailure that I had to deal with\n\n188\n00:11:07.606 --> 00:11:09.500\nin a production environment.\n\n189\n00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.080\nI was working as a network admin and\nI just started with the company.\n\n190\n00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.230\nAnd I was still getting acclimated,\ntrying to figure out everyone's names.\n\n191\n00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.920\nAnd then all of a sudden, I had a drive\ngo down in a particular server.\n\n192\n00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.780\nSo that was fun right off the bat.\n\n193\n00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.450\nBut it's really not difficult to\ndeal with, and I'll tell you why.\n\n194\n00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.910\nSo here in this particular situation,\nwe have three drives, right?\n\n195\n00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:37.310\nSo A, B and C, if I'm going to\nimplement striping like we spoke about\n\n196\n00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:41.950\nwith that RAID 0, we have a little\nbit of extra protection here.\n\n197\n00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.270\nThis is called striping with parity.\n\n198\n00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:49.750\nAnd parity is simply going to be a\nmathematical algorithm that is performed.\n\n199\n00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:55.207\nAnd it looks at the bits and\ndetermines if they're even or odd, and\n\n200\n00:11:55.207 --> 00:12:02.142\nit'll be able to tell if that information,\nif it should be even or odd to rebuild it.\n\n201\n00:12:02.142 --> 00:12:06.524\nSo what I'm trying to say here is,\nlet's say one of these drives,\n\n202\n00:12:06.524 --> 00:12:10.280\nI have three drives,\nif one of these drives were to fail,\n\n203\n00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.047\nthen I could plug in an additional drive.\n\n204\n00:12:13.047 --> 00:12:17.840\nOr I might even have one already\nin that disk enclosure sitting\n\n205\n00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.580\nthere as a hot spare and\nit might automatically kick in.\n\n206\n00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.310\nAnd guess what?\nBecause of these parity bits that\n\n207\n00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:29.944\nare spread out amongst the drives,\nit'll start to go ahead and\n\n208\n00:12:29.944 --> 00:12:34.157\nrebuild the new drive when you\nput it in there, the data.\n\n209\n00:12:34.157 --> 00:12:38.720\nIt'll start to rebuild the data, but\nthere are some things to consider.\n\n210\n00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.990\nSo I'm striping, so you see,\nlet's say, I had a file and\n\n211\n00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.980\nI go to save my information\nacross these three disks.\n\n212\n00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:49.242\nI save it onto disk A,\ndisk B, every third bit, so\n\n213\n00:12:49.242 --> 00:12:52.499\nto speak, is going to be a parity bit.\n\n214\n00:12:52.499 --> 00:12:56.155\nSo here I put parity, so\nthat file gets number three,\n\n215\n00:12:56.155 --> 00:13:00.600\nyou see the rest of that data is\nactually being written here on A.\n\n216\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.829\nAnd it goes through that process and\nyou can see how it's striped.\n\n217\n00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:05.606\nThat's where that name comes from there.\n\n218\n00:13:05.606 --> 00:13:09.360\nBut you're using these parity bits and\n\n219\n00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:14.320\nthey're actually one-third\nof your storage.\n\n220\n00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.400\nSo that takes up 33% of your disk space.\n\n221\n00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.046\nSo you're looking at\nabout a 67% utilization,\n\n222\n00:13:21.046 --> 00:13:23.565\nthat's something that you\nwanna account for here.\n\n223\n00:13:23.565 --> 00:13:28.085\nSo I'm seeing better utilization\nthan I did see with my mirroring.\n\n224\n00:13:28.085 --> 00:13:32.778\nI get that parity, so\nI don't have as big of an expense here and\n\n225\n00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:35.141\nI still have that redundancy.\n\n226\n00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:39.685\nSo this is why RAID 5 is so common.\n\n227\n00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:44.680\nBut you have to have a minimum of three\ndrives like this example I have here\n\n228\n00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.900\nto be able to tolerate one drive loss.\n\n229\n00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.660\nYou can add additional drives and\nthat will give you greater loss, but\n\n230\n00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.740\nit just depends on your organization.\n\n231\n00:13:54.740 --> 00:14:00.600\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, with RAID 5,\nwe do have to be careful on that 33% idea.\n\n232\n00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.080\nIt really is the equivalent of one volume\nor one particular hard drive for us.\n\n233\n00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Normally, with RAID 5 you can have\n\n234\n00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.730\na maximum of 32 disks.\n\n235\n00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:13.690\nAnd even with that, right, it protects\nyou but only with the loss of one drive.\n\n236\n00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:17.430\nIf you lose two drives,\nRAID 5 is not going to help you.\n\n237\n00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:21.200\nSo two drives going down simultaneously,\nit is not gonna help.\n\n238\n00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.810\nThere's enough parity,\neven across thirty-two drives,\n\n239\n00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:27.660\nto really rebuild only\nthe space of one drive.\n\n240\n00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.550\nSo in this instance, with Cherokee's,\nwhere there was only three drives,\n\n241\n00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.920\nshe is absolutely correct here,\nwhere it does take about a third of that.\n\n242\n00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.290\nBut if you have thirty-three,\nlike I said, thirty-two of them, though,\n\n243\n00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:43.250\nyou're only really wasting the space of\none drive [INAUDIBLE], I say wasting.\n\n244\n00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.790\nYou're not able to use the space of\none drive to help you to rebuild that.\n\n245\n00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.660\nSo you do want to make sure\nthat you understand that.\n\n246\n00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:55.470\nThere's a lot of times where you will\nsee the idea of RAID 5 implemented, but\n\n247\n00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:58.790\ntoday there's actually even more\ndifferent types of RAID arrays out there.\n\n248\n00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.200\nBut for us, at least at the very\nbasics of the beginning\n\n249\n00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:07.150\nCherokee's showing us at least RAID-0,\nRAID-1, and RAID-5.\n\n250\n00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:10.590\nThese are kind of a meat and\npotatoes, the foundational\n\n251\n00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:14.540\nnotes that you really have to make sure\nthat you understand as we proceed for.\n\n252\n00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.080\nAll right, so Cherokee what\nelse do we need to know about?\n\n253\n00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.890\n&gt;&gt; Let me just go ahead and\nsay a few more things about these,\n\n254\n00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.102\nI know this isn't a RAID show,\nwe have shows on that.\n\n255\n00:15:23.102 --> 00:15:27.470\nSo A+, I know Don's done some, so\nI would encourage you to go ahead and\n\n256\n00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.040\ntake a look at those if you're not\ntoo familiar with this concept.\n\n257\n00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.064\nThere is a lot to learn there.\n\n258\n00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:34.816\nYou do have to install additional drivers\nand things of that sort of nature.\n\n259\n00:15:34.816 --> 00:15:38.674\nI do wanna note that that\nparoty bit does because\n\n260\n00:15:38.674 --> 00:15:43.000\nyou are utilizing that\nmathematical algorithm.\n\n261\n00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.186\nIt takes a little bit of time,\ncomputational power.\n\n262\n00:15:45.186 --> 00:15:50.250\nSo you see a slight performance\ndegradation there, but\n\n263\n00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:56.294\nyou're happy to trade off there for\nthat safety net, if you will.\n\n264\n00:15:56.294 --> 00:15:59.686\nAnd I'm trying to think, I feel like there\nwas something else I wanted to say here.\n\n265\n00:15:59.686 --> 00:16:04.658\nDepending on the size of your\ndrives as well, so when, let's say,\n\n266\n00:16:04.658 --> 00:16:10.244\nyou do have a drive go down and fail,\nyou'll always want to try to rebuild and\n\n267\n00:16:10.244 --> 00:16:15.336\nuse that parity bit to rebuild that\nfailed drive as soon as possible.\n\n268\n00:16:15.336 --> 00:16:16.953\nBecause, like Ronnie said,\n\n269\n00:16:16.953 --> 00:16:20.310\nyou're not gonna be able to\ntolerate another drive loss.\n\n270\n00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:24.444\nAnd when we're talking about RAID arrays,\nand this is also important,\n\n271\n00:16:24.444 --> 00:16:28.643\nI should mention, you wanna get hard\ndisk drives that run at the same RPM,\n\n272\n00:16:28.643 --> 00:16:30.908\nthat are gonna be the same size drives.\n\n273\n00:16:30.908 --> 00:16:34.967\nBecause if we could look\nat my screen again here,\n\n274\n00:16:34.967 --> 00:16:38.631\nlet's say I have a one\nterabyte drive here,\n\n275\n00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:43.680\na one terabyte drive here and\na two terabyte drive here.\n\n276\n00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.630\nWell, guess what?\n\n277\n00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:48.620\nOn drive C, then I'm gonna be\nwasting one terabyte because\n\n278\n00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.230\nthey all have to be the same size as well.\n\n279\n00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:56.360\nThat rate is only going to be striping\nagainst the same size drives.\n\n280\n00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.183\nSo you wanna keep that in mind, so\nnormally, I would recommend to someone to\n\n281\n00:17:00.183 --> 00:17:04.710\nget almost identical drives from the same\nmanufacturer, same RPMs, same size.\n\n282\n00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:08.096\nSo you're kind of structured in that way.\n\n283\n00:17:08.096 --> 00:17:11.728\nAnd a lot of times, if you do purchase\ndrives that are very similar,\n\n284\n00:17:11.728 --> 00:17:14.938\nthey've probably been\nmanufactured from the same batch.\n\n285\n00:17:14.938 --> 00:17:19.079\nAnd they're seeing the same amount\nuse in that machine, and so\n\n286\n00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:23.454\nthe likelihood if you are working\non a machine, powering it down,\n\n287\n00:17:23.454 --> 00:17:26.367\npowering it up, that can tax those drives.\n\n288\n00:17:26.367 --> 00:17:30.892\nAnd if they're within the same life\nspan of that drive that just failed,\n\n289\n00:17:30.892 --> 00:17:34.091\nthere may be a chance that\nanother drive will fail.\n\n290\n00:17:34.091 --> 00:17:38.048\nYou don't wanna take that chance\nin a production environment,\n\n291\n00:17:38.048 --> 00:17:42.528\nso you always wanna try to repair that\ndamaged drive as soon as possible.\n\n292\n00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:45.046\nAnd depending on the size of the drive,\n\n293\n00:17:45.046 --> 00:17:50.008\nhow much information was actually stored\non the drive, that will all dictate\n\n294\n00:17:50.008 --> 00:17:55.100\nhow long it will take to rebuild the new\ndrive that you replaced it with.\n\n295\n00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:00.096\nAnd don't expect to really be utilizing\nthat machine during that rebuild time\n\n296\n00:18:00.096 --> 00:18:05.106\nbecause it significantly impacts\nperformance during that rebuild process.\n\n297\n00:18:05.106 --> 00:18:06.349\nBut that's RAID,\n\n298\n00:18:06.349 --> 00:18:11.590\nI just wanted to throw that out there\nbecause we're gonna be moving forward.\n\n299\n00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.930\nTalking about other ideas and\n\n300\n00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:19.090\nconcepts that we can use to implement\na software based style RAID,\n\n301\n00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:23.680\nand that's kind of what\nMicrosoft has to offer us, okay?\n\n302\n00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:28.278\nBut before we do that, I do wanna cover\nsome additional terms because like\n\n303\n00:18:28.278 --> 00:18:31.551\nRonnie had alluded to,\nthere are a lot to know here.\n\n304\n00:18:31.551 --> 00:18:35.541\nAnd I said I'll let you know and\nlet you know which ones to worry about, so\n\n305\n00:18:35.541 --> 00:18:37.579\nlet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n306\n00:18:37.579 --> 00:18:43.341\nAnd one that I do wanna mention\nis these two concepts here, okay?\n\n307\n00:18:43.341 --> 00:18:47.937\nWhen you're configuring your drives,\nyou're gonna be questioned and\n\n308\n00:18:47.937 --> 00:18:51.625\nsay hey, would you like this\ndrive to be formatted as MBR,\n\n309\n00:18:51.625 --> 00:18:56.830\nMaster Boot Record, or GPT,\nwhich stands for GUID Partition Table?\n\n310\n00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:59.150\nSo let's talk about MBR for a second.\n\n311\n00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.380\nIt's been around for a very long time.\n\n312\n00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:05.940\nThis is going to be an older, I mean,\nthis is even before I was born.\n\n313\n00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.830\nThey were using this particular format for\ndrives.\n\n314\n00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:12.585\nAnd you're able to go ahead and\ncreate three primary partitions,\n\n315\n00:19:12.585 --> 00:19:17.360\nand if you don't know what a partition is,\ndon't worry, we're gonna cover that.\n\n316\n00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.527\nAnd then one extended partition,\n\n317\n00:19:19.527 --> 00:19:23.867\nbut people would be able to get\naround that by adding logical drives.\n\n318\n00:19:23.867 --> 00:19:28.780\nWe really saw some limitations with\nthat particular type of drive,\n\n319\n00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.150\nand there was an issue\nhere also with the size.\n\n320\n00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.420\nIf you look at that,\nyou've got a 2 TB max.\n\n321\n00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:41.160\nSo back in the early 80s,\n2 TB was almost like a fantasy.\n\n322\n00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.010\nBut nowadays, it's for\norganizations and businesses.\n\n323\n00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:47.900\nIt's almost impractical for\nsome use cases.\n\n324\n00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:52.480\nSo we do have that 2 TB limitation there.\n\n325\n00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:57.100\nNow also, with MBR, it creates a boot\n\n326\n00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.730\nsector at the beginning that points to\nthe locations of the partitions and\n\n327\n00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.990\nprovides a boot loader for\nthe operating system.\n\n328\n00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:09.146\nWhat that means is if I have the sector\nthat contains that boot information,\n\n329\n00:20:09.146 --> 00:20:12.288\nif that sector on that\ndrive becomes corrupt,\n\n330\n00:20:12.288 --> 00:20:16.820\nI'm on that a lot because that\nprovides a single point of failure.\n\n331\n00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:22.102\nAn improvement, a huge improvement, and\none of the many that our GPT formats offer\n\n332\n00:20:22.102 --> 00:20:27.386\nus is going to be that instead of just one\nsector containing that boot information,\n\n333\n00:20:27.386 --> 00:20:31.405\nit's spread out, so\nthat you have a redundancy there as well.\n\n334\n00:20:31.405 --> 00:20:34.997\nSo you're not just relying on one\nindividual sector because let's face it,\n\n335\n00:20:34.997 --> 00:20:37.261\nsectors, they can go bad,\nand once they go bad,\n\n336\n00:20:37.261 --> 00:20:39.770\nthere's nothing you can do\nat that particular time.\n\n337\n00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:43.978\nSo machines, about Windows 2003 SP-1 and\n\n338\n00:20:43.978 --> 00:20:48.493\nbeyond, should be able to go ahead and\nsupport GPT,\n\n339\n00:20:48.493 --> 00:20:53.330\nthe operating systems,\nwe're talking Windows here.\n\n340\n00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:56.363\nNow it's gonna be\nrecommended obviously for\n\n341\n00:20:56.363 --> 00:20:59.170\ndrives that are larger than 2 TB in size.\n\n342\n00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:04.700\nYou can have up to 128 partitions on\neach disc, and remember, whereas before,\n\n343\n00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:08.810\nI said you had that three partition limit\nthere for those primary partitions,\n\n344\n00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:13.840\nyou can have up to 18\nexabytes per volume in size.\n\n345\n00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.210\nSo that's pretty significant,\njust looking at that alone.\n\n346\n00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.880\nBIOS has to support the GPT for\nthe boot partition.\n\n347\n00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.780\nSo you may wanna take a look at that and\nlook at your motherboard because if you're\n\n348\n00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:33.230\nrunning GPT is part of UFI,\nwhich is kind of like that face lift for\n\n349\n00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:37.530\nolder BIOS systems there, so those\nare gonna be two options that you have.\n\n350\n00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:43.090\nSome other terms that I want to mention\nhere, let's take a look at file systems.\n\n351\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:49.458\nThis is gonna be something that you will\nalso be prompted and asked about, right?\n\n352\n00:21:49.458 --> 00:21:53.920\nSo the system's gonna say, hey,\nwhat kinda file system do you want?\n\n353\n00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.360\nWell, there are a lot of\ndifferent file systems out there.\n\n354\n00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.260\nWhen we're talking about\na Windows environment,\n\n355\n00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.810\nwe have only a few that we\nreally should even consider.\n\n356\n00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.007\nOur FAT file systems,\nthis is the older legacy FAT.\n\n357\n00:22:06.007 --> 00:22:11.474\nEven FAT 32 has significant limitations,\nwhich I wouldn't recommend, unless you're\n\n358\n00:22:11.474 --> 00:22:16.760\nworking with a legacy system, and you\nneed to go ahead and use FAT 32 system.\n\n359\n00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:21.270\nMost likely, you'll be working with NTFS,\nNew Technology File System,\n\n360\n00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.790\nthis has been around for a very long time.\n\n361\n00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:30.450\nIt includes metadata for indexing, which\nwill also allow you to implement ACLs.\n\n362\n00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.530\nIt also provides encryption.\n\n363\n00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:37.418\nYou have your encrypting file system and\ncompression as well.\n\n364\n00:22:37.418 --> 00:22:41.075\nYou can set disk quotas and\nperform inspections.\n\n365\n00:22:41.075 --> 00:22:45.485\nSo it's probably the preferred\nfile system here.\n\n366\n00:22:45.485 --> 00:22:49.605\nAs a matter of fact,\nthere is a newer file system, but\n\n367\n00:22:49.605 --> 00:22:53.099\nit's called REFS, resilient file system.\n\n368\n00:22:53.099 --> 00:22:59.245\nBut you're not able to boot off of REFS as\nof yet, so that's kind of what Microsoft,\n\n369\n00:22:59.245 --> 00:23:03.327\nI think, is striving for,\nis for REFS to replace NTFS.\n\n370\n00:23:03.327 --> 00:23:07.892\nBut at the time of this recording,\nwhich what year are we in here,\n\n371\n00:23:07.892 --> 00:23:11.968\nRonnie, 2017,\nyou're gonna be using NTFS, okay?\n\n372\n00:23:11.968 --> 00:23:16.361\nSo [LAUGH] I'm glad you set that\nstraight for me there, Ronnie.\n\n373\n00:23:16.361 --> 00:23:16.975\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n374\n00:23:16.975 --> 00:23:21.313\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But yeah, so\nresilient file systems, pretty cool.\n\n375\n00:23:21.313 --> 00:23:24.158\nAnd so you might think, well, Cherokee,\n\n376\n00:23:24.158 --> 00:23:29.391\nif you just told me that I can't have\na bootable drive, what could I use it for?\n\n377\n00:23:29.391 --> 00:23:32.710\nREFS formatted volumes\nhere would be great for\n\n378\n00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:37.571\nany kind of additional drive space,\nlike storage, file storage.\n\n379\n00:23:37.571 --> 00:23:40.978\nAnd it's cool because with NTFS,\n\n380\n00:23:40.978 --> 00:23:45.912\nif I had any kind of immediate shut down,\nokay, so\n\n381\n00:23:45.912 --> 00:23:51.562\nnot a graceful shutdown, but\nmaybe I had a loss of power.\n\n382\n00:23:51.562 --> 00:23:56.587\nWell, It's highly likely that I could\nsee data corruption with the way\n\n383\n00:23:56.587 --> 00:24:02.560\nthat that file system handles those\nprompt shut-downs, unplanned shut-downs.\n\n384\n00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.560\nWith ReFS,\nit has that resilient file system,\n\n385\n00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.780\nit has a self-healing capability there,\nright?\n\n386\n00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:14.680\nIt doesn't even have certain types\nof discrete pair functions because\n\n387\n00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.950\nit auto heals.\n\n388\n00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:17.550\nSo that's pretty cool there.\n\n389\n00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.820\nIt is backward compatible with NTFS but\n\n390\n00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.880\nit doesn't allow those permissions,\nit doesn't have compression.\n\n391\n00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.270\nIt does have increased data\nverification and error collection.\n\n392\n00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:31.620\nSupports larger files,\ndirectories, volumes.\n\n393\n00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.690\nLower functionality as compared to NFS,\nbecause, like I said,\n\n394\n00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:39.350\nit has no EFS, compression, and\ndifferent types of assignments.\n\n395\n00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.020\nBut, they're still working on it,\n\n396\n00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.500\nstill trying to develop it, so\ndefinitely keep your eye out for that.\n\n397\n00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:47.812\nAll right,\nwhat else do we wanna cover here?\n\n398\n00:24:50.867 --> 00:24:53.130\nFile systems, I'm just checking.\n\n399\n00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:59.940\nNow, you'll also see something whenever\nI go in to show you how to set this up,\n\n400\n00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:04.750\nan option,\nit'll say basic versus dynamic disks.\n\n401\n00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:09.580\nSo if we take a look at my screen here,\nI did wanna show you this.\n\n402\n00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:13.640\nWe will come back to it when we're\nactually performing this function, but\n\n403\n00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:18.560\nyour basic disks, like the name implies,\npretty straight forward, pretty basic.\n\n404\n00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.929\nIt's the same structure as in\nthe previous Windows systems,\n\n405\n00:25:21.929 --> 00:25:25.680\nyou still got that 4 partition,\n3 primary and 1 extended.\n\n406\n00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.370\nIt doesn't provide integrated\nsoftware resistance to damage and\n\n407\n00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:30.560\nit allows us to boot.\n\n408\n00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:35.280\nSo if you're ever in a conundrum and\nyou're like, am I able to boot?\n\n409\n00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.870\nThis is a safe bet here when you're\ndealing with basic disks because when we\n\n410\n00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.450\ntalk about dynamic disks,\n\n411\n00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:46.400\nsome configurations will allow you to boot\nin a dynamic disk but not all of them.\n\n412\n00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.860\nSo just to be safe if you are not\ntoo familiar with that there.\n\n413\n00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.450\nI do wanna note that there is\n\n414\n00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:57.030\na one way conversion that Microsoft\ndoes support from basic to dynamic.\n\n415\n00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:05.830\nIt's not going to be able to be reversed\nas far as dynamic to basic without\n\n416\n00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:10.290\nthe removal of your data, so just keep\nthat in mind that is important to note.\n\n417\n00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:14.440\nWhen you're working in the operating\nsystem, it will remind you of that if\n\n418\n00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.740\nyou're using the graphical user interface\nand I'll show you how that will happen.\n\n419\n00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.620\nA lot of the information that we've\ncovered here will make more sense as we\n\n420\n00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.090\ncontinue and walk through this process.\n\n421\n00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:28.800\nBut just know dynamic disks\nthey can expand functionalities\n\n422\n00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.610\nwhen there are more disks.\n\n423\n00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:35.340\nIf I want to take advantage of a lot of\nthese configuration settings that we'll\n\n424\n00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:40.230\ntake a look at, I will need to\nuse a dynamic disk configuration.\n\n425\n00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:44.080\nBasic, very straightforward,\nvery basic, right?\n\n426\n00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.860\nAnd also with your dynamic disks,\nit may involve volumes\n\n427\n00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:52.370\nwhich join multiple partition and physical\ndisks, and we'll take a look at that.\n\n428\n00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:56.408\nAnd it may provide solutions to offer\nresistance to damage with no hardware,\n\n429\n00:26:56.408 --> 00:26:58.880\nwithout adding additional hardware.\n\n430\n00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:04.390\nAnd currently, it is going to be replaced\nwith a storage space's functionality.\n\n431\n00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:08.200\nAnd we will get there as well,\nbut baby steps, baby steps.\n\n432\n00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.989\nSo a lot of this information I've covered,\nthese terms,\n\n433\n00:27:11.989 --> 00:27:14.631\nif they don't make sense that's fine.\n\n434\n00:27:14.631 --> 00:27:19.104\nLet's go ahead and take some time getting\nin the actual operating system, and\n\n435\n00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:21.828\nif you still don't understand,\nthen go back.\n\n436\n00:27:21.828 --> 00:27:24.735\nAnd I've provided links and\nthe show notes as well for\n\n437\n00:27:24.735 --> 00:27:27.650\nadditional information to\nhelp you with that there.\n\n438\n00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:30.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee,\nwell, thank you again for\n\n439\n00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.835\nhelping us to get started with\nthe idea of local storage here.\n\n440\n00:27:33.835 --> 00:27:38.560\nWhere we did take a look at some of the\ndifferences between RAID implementation,\n\n441\n00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.180\nthat we have RAID0, RAID1, RAID5.\n\n442\n00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:44.800\nAnd also Cherokee helped us a little bit\nwith the difference between basic and\n\n443\n00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.050\ndynamic disk.\n\n444\n00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.540\nAs well as talk about the partitioning\ninformation as well, GPT,\n\n445\n00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:54.550\nas well as the MBR which I couldn't\nremember I right off top of my head.\n\n446\n00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.830\nBut there is a lot more to come,\nand a lot more to actually see,\n\n447\n00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:58.770\nnow that we have got\nsome of the basic terms.\n\n448\n00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:01.300\nSo, that's what we want to do is we\nwant to save that for a part two.\n\n449\n00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.500\nSo, it's a great place for\nus to sign off for this episode.\n\n450\n00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.990\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nRonnie Wong.\n\n451\n00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.950\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n452\n00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:10.817\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Windows Server 101 shows.\n\n453\n00:28:10.817 --> 00:28:17.949\n[MUSIC]\n\n454\n00:28:17.949 -->

00:00:06.448\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.448 --> 00:00:08.245\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.245 --> 00:00:12.280\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.464\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:18.182\nYou're watching\nthe Windows Server 101 show.\n\n8\n00:00:18.182 --> 00:00:19.682\nI am your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:23.512\nAnd today we're taking a look\nat part two on working with\n\n10\n00:00:23.512 --> 00:00:27.356\nlocal storage inside of our\nvery first part that we did.\n\n11\n00:00:27.356 --> 00:00:30.621\nWe've talked about some of the basic\nterminologies that we need to be familiar\n\n12\n00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:31.665\nwith the server admins.\n\n13\n00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:33.825\nWhen we start dealing with\nthe idea of storage and\n\n14\n00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.467\nnow in part two we're actually\ngonna see a little bit more.\n\n15\n00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:38.400\nAnd here to help us out is\ngonna be Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n16\n00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.853\nCherokee, welcome back to the studio.\n\n17\n00:00:39.853 --> 00:00:40.932\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me Ronnie.\n\n18\n00:00:40.932 --> 00:00:41.953\nThat's exactly right.\n\n19\n00:00:41.953 --> 00:00:44.749\nWe've learned quite a bit so\nfar in that first show and\n\n20\n00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:47.671\nit's okay if you don't fully\nunderstand those terms,\n\n21\n00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:51.853\nbecause we're gonna spend extra time and\nreally dive into it within this show.\n\n22\n00:00:51.853 --> 00:00:54.499\nSo let's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n23\n00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:59.213\nSo if we think about all the things that\nwe've discussed in the previous episode,\n\n24\n00:00:59.213 --> 00:01:03.397\nDisk Management is a great place to\ngo ahead and well manage those disks.\n\n25\n00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:04.277\nAnd it gives you,\n\n26\n00:01:04.277 --> 00:01:08.161\nprovides a graphical user interface in\nwhich you can perform this functions.\n\n27\n00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:12.135\nYou can go ahead and initialize,\nput your disks online and\n\n28\n00:01:12.135 --> 00:01:16.529\nyou can format them and\neven create different types of volumes.\n\n29\n00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:18.333\nSo that's what we will\nbe doing in this show.\n\n30\n00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:22.876\nYou do of course have other options\nthat Microsoft does leaning towards.\n\n31\n00:01:22.876 --> 00:01:27.582\nSo for instance,\nwe'll be speaking later on storage pools.\n\n32\n00:01:27.582 --> 00:01:32.132\nYou also have a couple command line\ninterfaces that we'll introduce as well.\n\n33\n00:01:32.132 --> 00:01:36.831\nSo you guys are already familiar with\nPowerShell you can manage disks via\n\n34\n00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:40.298\nPowerShell, as well as\nthe disk part.exe utility,\n\n35\n00:01:40.298 --> 00:01:43.009\nwhich is command line interface as well.\n\n36\n00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.880\nSo let's go ahead and\nget started with our GUIs.\n\n37\n00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.977\nAnd I wanna introduce disk management and\nshow you where you can go ahead and\n\n38\n00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:50.833\npull that out.\n\n39\n00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:54.083\nI actually already have it pulled up but\nlet me just close out of here.\n\n40\n00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:57.952\nYou could use your run line or\nyou could go ahead and\n\n41\n00:01:57.952 --> 00:02:02.112\njust right-click and\nhere you see Disk Management.\n\n42\n00:02:02.112 --> 00:02:08.564\nAnd the actual run line would just be\ndiskmgmt.msc and we'll go ahead and\n\n43\n00:02:08.564 --> 00:02:14.407\nwe'll hit OK, and this will pull\nup our Disk Management console.\n\n44\n00:02:14.407 --> 00:02:17.640\nGive it a second for\nthis information to load, and you'll see\n\n45\n00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.009\nthat I already have some disks that have\nbeen added into this particular computer.\n\n46\n00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.184\nSo let's take a look.\n\n47\n00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:26.515\nThe volumes are indicated\nin this top pane, but\n\n48\n00:02:26.515 --> 00:02:31.352\nI'm just gonna pull this up to give\nus a little more room to work with.\n\n49\n00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:34.997\nAll right, Disk 0, Disk 1,\nDisk 2, Disk 3, and\n\n50\n00:02:34.997 --> 00:02:39.390\nlet's see how many disks do we got here,\nwe've got quite a few.\n\n51\n00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.746\nWe've got Disk 4 and\nthen we also have some CDs,\n\n52\n00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:47.055\nwhich are considered disks as well.\n\n53\n00:02:47.055 --> 00:02:52.687\nAnd if you look at these CDs the CD Rom 0,\nCD Rom 1, up in this top pane here,\n\n54\n00:02:52.687 --> 00:02:57.892\nyou can see the file system associated\nwith each one of those volumes.\n\n55\n00:02:57.892 --> 00:03:00.999\nFor instance here for volume C,\n\n56\n00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:06.074\nyou can note that we're\nusing the NTFS file system.\n\n57\n00:03:06.074 --> 00:03:09.614\nAnd in the last episode, we spoke\nabout the different file systems and\n\n58\n00:03:09.614 --> 00:03:12.445\nwhy you would or\nwould not want to be using certain ones.\n\n59\n00:03:12.445 --> 00:03:16.479\nUDF is actually a file system that's\ndesigned, what did we say that was,\n\n60\n00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:17.008\nRonnie?\n\n61\n00:03:17.008 --> 00:03:18.891\nYou told me before the show,\nit's been a while.\n\n62\n00:03:18.891 --> 00:03:20.283\n&gt;&gt; Universal disk format.\n\n63\n00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:22.025\n&gt;&gt; Universal disk format.\n\n64\n00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:26.435\nYes, so that's one of the different\nformats that you can use to go ahead and\n\n65\n00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:28.475\nfile systems for like CDs, DVDs.\n\n66\n00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:32.801\nBut NTFS, remember we said that was\nthe only file system currently within\n\n67\n00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:37.074\na Windows operating system that could\nhold that boot information here.\n\n68\n00:03:37.074 --> 00:03:41.186\nSo our C drive is going to\nbe our bootable disk here.\n\n69\n00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:43.422\nSo let me go ahead and zoom out,\n\n70\n00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:48.067\nand you can see our C drive is\nnoted here as NTFS, it's healthy.\n\n71\n00:03:48.067 --> 00:03:49.851\nWe also see something else.\n\n72\n00:03:49.851 --> 00:03:53.739\nIf you're performing a clean installation\nof the server operating system, and\n\n73\n00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.440\nwith other operating systems\nlike client side as well.\n\n74\n00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.401\nYou also see the system reserved partition\nhere and you can see if 500 megabytes.\n\n75\n00:04:02.401 --> 00:04:06.899\nIt's healthy and the information that's\ncontained there is going to be some\n\n76\n00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:11.673\noverhead information that the operating\nsystem can use such as your boot sector or\n\n77\n00:04:11.673 --> 00:04:14.041\nyour boot configuration information.\n\n78\n00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:19.156\nYou've got Bitlocker information,\nif you're also going to be utilizing that,\n\n79\n00:04:19.156 --> 00:04:23.297\nand then you also have,\nwhat was the other thing here for that?\n\n80\n00:04:23.297 --> 00:04:25.305\nYour recovery,\nyour Windows RE environment.\n\n81\n00:04:25.305 --> 00:04:29.335\nSo those are gonna be some different\noverhead utilities that are stored there\n\n82\n00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:29.838\nas well.\n\n83\n00:04:29.838 --> 00:04:34.274\nNow, you'll notice then I have disk 0,\nso we said that we had,\n\n84\n00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.174\nit went all the way up to 4.\n\n85\n00:04:36.174 --> 00:04:40.719\nSo within this particular machine I\nactually have five physical hard disk\n\n86\n00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:41.379\ndrives and\n\n87\n00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:46.085\nremember we spoke about what a physical\nhard disk drive was in the last show.\n\n88\n00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:49.144\nThese are drives that are tangible,\nI can touch them.\n\n89\n00:04:49.144 --> 00:04:53.905\nNow it doesn't really matter if they're\ngoing to be regular spindle optical\n\n90\n00:04:53.905 --> 00:04:56.995\ndrives, or\nif you're using solid state drives.\n\n91\n00:04:56.995 --> 00:05:02.530\nSo, it just depends on the cost, and\nif you can afford that or not, really.\n\n92\n00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.746\nBut, you'll also notice something here,\ndifferences in color.\n\n93\n00:05:06.746 --> 00:05:09.721\nSo, they kinda have a color\ncoding thing going on,\n\n94\n00:05:09.721 --> 00:05:13.337\nthere's a lot of different that\nthis interface can give you.\n\n95\n00:05:13.337 --> 00:05:18.671\nOn this first drive, Disk 0,\nI can see that there's something that says\n\n96\n00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:23.762\n17 gigs of unallocated space within\nthis last partition over here.\n\n97\n00:05:23.762 --> 00:05:28.110\nAnd, okay, that leaves a couple questions\nlike number one, what's a partition, and\n\n98\n00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.368\nnumber two, what's unallocated, right?\n\n99\n00:05:30.368 --> 00:05:33.941\nSo, a partition if we think about it,\n\n100\n00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:39.191\nwe can see on Disk 0,\nthis particular hard disk drive,\n\n101\n00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:44.465\nI have three separate spaces\nwithin this disk, right?\n\n102\n00:05:44.465 --> 00:05:50.409\nSo, I have 500 megabytes for\nthat system reserved partition, all right?\n\n103\n00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:54.687\nI've got about 22 and\na half gigs on my C drive here for\n\n104\n00:05:54.687 --> 00:06:00.194\nthat particular partition, and\nthen I have 17 gigs of extra space.\n\n105\n00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:03.731\nSo unallocated means it\nhasn't been formatted,\n\n106\n00:06:03.731 --> 00:06:08.709\nit hasn't been configured in any way,\nit's just extra space there.\n\n107\n00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:11.992\nSo the terminology with Microsoft\ncan get a little murky at\n\n108\n00:06:11.992 --> 00:06:16.758\ntimes when they're talking about the\ndifference between partitions and volumes.\n\n109\n00:06:16.758 --> 00:06:21.670\nSo for now I think it's just best\nif you understand that a partition\n\n110\n00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.477\nis almost like a unit of measurement,\n\n111\n00:06:24.477 --> 00:06:28.974\nas a way to indicates space that\nis being used within a drive.\n\n112\n00:06:28.974 --> 00:06:31.880\nBut whenever you hear\nme say the term volume,\n\n113\n00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.485\nit means I've configured it,\nI've selected a file system to choose.\n\n114\n00:06:36.485 --> 00:06:38.891\nAnd I've also assigned a drive letter or\n\n115\n00:06:38.891 --> 00:06:41.736\nI've either mounted\nthat particular volume.\n\n116\n00:06:41.736 --> 00:06:45.229\nSo after I've configured it,\nMicrosoft likes to use the term volume.\n\n117\n00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:48.670\nSo just so we're clear on that,\ndon't get hung up on it though.\n\n118\n00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.332\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee, you make a very good point on\nthis particular type of terminology here.\n\n119\n00:06:53.332 --> 00:06:56.907\nRemember that for us, a partition\nessentially helps us to chop up\n\n120\n00:06:56.907 --> 00:07:01.067\nwhatever hard drive that we have into\nthe useable space that we want it to do.\n\n121\n00:07:01.067 --> 00:07:06.310\nBut the term volume, when it boils down\nto the kinda the basic thing is if you\n\n122\n00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.470\nneed to store data onto it, you're not\nstoring it on a partition per say,\n\n123\n00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.318\nyou are gonna now store it onto a volume.\n\n124\n00:07:14.318 --> 00:07:16.505\nThe difference between the partition and\n\n125\n00:07:16.505 --> 00:07:20.752\nthe volume is that now we actually have a\nfile system, we can now actually use it in\n\n126\n00:07:20.752 --> 00:07:24.145\nthe structure with the file system\nto be able to store data on it.\n\n127\n00:07:24.145 --> 00:07:26.829\nSo, the partitioning is\nabout dividing up space.\n\n128\n00:07:26.829 --> 00:07:30.861\nThe idea of volume is now logically being\non the store down on it that we can now\n\n129\n00:07:30.861 --> 00:07:31.684\nfind it again.\n\n130\n00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:35.958\nSo that's really when you boil it\nall down that's kind of how it goes.\n\n131\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.765\nAnd Windows has to able to\ndistinguish between the two and\n\n132\n00:07:38.765 --> 00:07:42.451\nthat's why Cherokee is making the\ndistinction between them even though we\n\n133\n00:07:42.451 --> 00:07:44.861\ndon't wanna try and\ncram that down your throat.\n\n134\n00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:46.586\nIt is something that we\nhave to get used to.\n\n135\n00:07:46.586 --> 00:07:49.633\n&gt;&gt; And that's right Ronnie,\nbecause once that disk is ready, right?\n\n136\n00:07:49.633 --> 00:07:52.955\nIt's been configured, it's ready for\nuse, because here's the thing,\n\n137\n00:07:52.955 --> 00:07:56.027\nwhen you first add those drives\ninto the physical computer, right?\n\n138\n00:07:56.027 --> 00:07:59.302\nThe machine itself,\nIt's not ready to be used.\n\n139\n00:07:59.302 --> 00:08:01.425\nThere are some things that we need to do.\n\n140\n00:08:01.425 --> 00:08:04.282\nSo if I added additional\ndrives to my computer and\n\n141\n00:08:04.282 --> 00:08:06.303\nthen I pulled up disk management,\n\n142\n00:08:06.303 --> 00:08:10.557\nthe first time that that operating\nsystem recognized those new drives,\n\n143\n00:08:10.557 --> 00:08:14.900\nit would go ahead and alert me with\nan initialization wizard that pops up.\n\n144\n00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.960\nHey, do you wanna initialize this disk?\n\n145\n00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.060\nYou're not always gonna get that wizard\nif you had already had disk management,\n\n146\n00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.645\nthe console, brought up.\n\n147\n00:08:21.645 --> 00:08:27.630\nSometimes I haven't plugged any brand\nnew disks into this machine to show you.\n\n148\n00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.268\nBut that would be the very first\nthing you do and it's very simple.\n\n149\n00:08:30.268 --> 00:08:34.240\nYou just right-click on top of the disk\nand select Initialize and that's it.\n\n150\n00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.792\nThe second thing you would need to do is\nto go ahead and bring that drive online.\n\n151\n00:08:38.792 --> 00:08:43.660\nAnd if we look at my screen,\nwe can see that my C Drive is online.\n\n152\n00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.550\nAnd that's because, well,\nthis operating system, this environment,\n\n153\n00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.280\neverything you're looking\nat here on my screen\n\n154\n00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.590\nis coming from this operating system\nthat's running, so it's obviously online.\n\n155\n00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.910\nBut if you note some of these\nother drives are not all online.\n\n156\n00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.450\nYou can see a little red down arrow,\n\n157\n00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.320\nactually you might not be able to see it,\nbut here it is.\n\n158\n00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:08.570\nSo notice here, that Disk 2 is online,\nand Disk 3 is offline.\n\n159\n00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.050\nBut that's really easy to change,\n\n160\n00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.860\nyou simply just right-click on it and\nselect Online.\n\n161\n00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:19.532\nNow, you have to turn that drive, bring\nit online before you can go ahead and\n\n162\n00:09:19.532 --> 00:09:23.750\nperform any kind of changes or\nconfiguration settings to it.\n\n163\n00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.940\nOtherwise, you'll see here, for\ninstance, if I go ahead and\n\n164\n00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.760\ntry to do something on disk one,\nit's all greyed out my options here.\n\n165\n00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.660\nI can't create a new simple volume or\nspanned volume.\n\n166\n00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.890\nSo once I go ahead and\nbring this drive online, all right,\n\n167\n00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.430\nand it's online, I do have these\noptions available to me now.\n\n168\n00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:51.362\nSo let's talk about the different\ntypes of volumes that I could create.\n\n169\n00:09:51.362 --> 00:09:54.748\nThere are five different types of\nvolumes that I wanna show you today.\n\n170\n00:09:54.748 --> 00:09:58.600\nThe first one's going to\nbe that very simple and\n\n171\n00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.120\nbasic volume, and\nif we could just go full screen.\n\n172\n00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.820\nThank you for that.\n\n173\n00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.120\nThis is going to be a volume where the\nfree space on a single disk partition is\n\n174\n00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.950\nused for storage space.\n\n175\n00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.560\nIt can be extended on the same disk or\nonto an additional disk.\n\n176\n00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.340\nBut if it is extended on to an additional\ndisk, it then is not just basic or\n\n177\n00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.510\nsimple anymore.\n\n178\n00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:25.490\nIt actually becomes a spanned volume and\nit's gonna be called dynamic.\n\n179\n00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.279\nSo simple disks, basic,\njust like they sound,\n\n180\n00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:30.739\nthere's not a whole lot\nI can do with them.\n\n181\n00:10:30.739 --> 00:10:35.148\nI can do three things right here, assign\na mount point folder path to a drive.\n\n182\n00:10:35.148 --> 00:10:38.830\nI can extend a basic volume and\nshrink the basic volume.\n\n183\n00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:43.560\nBut there's not a whole lot of\nconfiguration components that I can do\n\n184\n00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.420\nwith simple or basic volumes.\n\n185\n00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.530\nSo let's just go ahead and get back into\nthat lab machine, and I'll show you.\n\n186\n00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.210\nIt only takes a few seconds here to\ngo ahead and create a simple volume.\n\n187\n00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:56.535\nAnd you just simply do that by\nright-clicking on top of that, and\n\n188\n00:10:56.535 --> 00:10:57.930\nit'll initiate a wizard.\n\n189\n00:11:00.515 --> 00:11:03.150\nThis is just a welcome screen and\nyou'll go ahead and click Next.\n\n190\n00:11:04.378 --> 00:11:08.917\nSo here I see the maximum disk space\navailable in megabytes to me and\n\n191\n00:11:08.917 --> 00:11:10.467\nthen we'll hit Next.\n\n192\n00:11:10.467 --> 00:11:11.834\nAnd you can specify here.\n\n193\n00:11:11.834 --> 00:11:17.178\nYou don't have to use all of this\nspace here for that particular volume.\n\n194\n00:11:17.178 --> 00:11:22.377\nYou can create multiple volumes\ndepending on the difference,\n\n195\n00:11:22.377 --> 00:11:25.132\nif you're using NBR versus GPT.\n\n196\n00:11:25.132 --> 00:11:30.900\nWe'll hit Next and you can go ahead and\nassign a drive letter, here they have E.\n\n197\n00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.440\nAnd mounting it is just a different way\nof how you're accessing that information.\n\n198\n00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.520\nThe end users don't see it as\nan actual letter drive in that way.\n\n199\n00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.580\nIt's just seen as a folder, per se.\n\n200\n00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.015\nBut we'll keep it the way it is\nwith these faults, hit Next and\n\n201\n00:11:45.015 --> 00:11:49.526\nhere you're prompted to say, what type\nof file system would you like to choose?\n\n202\n00:11:49.526 --> 00:11:52.866\nAnd remember, I do have different options.\n\n203\n00:11:52.866 --> 00:11:55.359\nI'm most likely gonna be using NTFS.\n\n204\n00:11:55.359 --> 00:11:59.245\nHowever, REFS moving forward in the future\nmay be a likely choice as well.\n\n205\n00:11:59.245 --> 00:12:01.811\nBut for now, we'll keep it at NTFS.\n\n206\n00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:05.526\nAllocation unit size, we don't really\nhave to go too much in-depth here.\n\n207\n00:12:05.526 --> 00:12:10.420\nBecause that really deals with\nthe individual components on the different\n\n208\n00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.682\nunits of size on the hard\ndisk drives themselves,\n\n209\n00:12:13.682 --> 00:12:18.900\nwhich is more geared towards your higher\ncertifications and trainings there.\n\n210\n00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:23.440\nAnd we'll just keep this default\ninformation for our new volume here.\n\n211\n00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.730\nI do wanna note, though,\nI'll zoom in here a little bit,\n\n212\n00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.826\nyou're performing a quick format.\n\n213\n00:12:28.826 --> 00:12:33.655\nIf you're ever in a rush, there is gonna\nbe a delay if you don't have this box\n\n214\n00:12:33.655 --> 00:12:37.129\nchecked, whenever you're\nperforming that format,\n\n215\n00:12:37.129 --> 00:12:41.979\nit's always good to go ahead and uncheck\nit if you have the additional time.\n\n216\n00:12:41.979 --> 00:12:43.590\nBut that's not always the case.\n\n217\n00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:47.970\nFor now, I'll leave it checked and\nyou can provide file and\n\n218\n00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.360\nfolder compression if you choose to do so.\n\n219\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.050\nBut I am not, so we'll hit Next,\nand really that's it.\n\n220\n00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.940\nIt was really that easy, so\nwe'll just hit Finish here.\n\n221\n00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.970\nAnd you'll see how it takes a second\nto format and it really did.\n\n222\n00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.830\nIt was just one second there.\n\n223\n00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.780\nYou can see the name,\nthis was a default name,\n\n224\n00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.570\nwe weren't super creative there and\njust kept it at New Volume.\n\n225\n00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.754\nYou can see that drive letter E and\n\n226\n00:13:10.754 --> 00:13:14.345\nit's indicating a healthy\nprimary partition there.\n\n227\n00:13:14.345 --> 00:13:18.916\nSo your interface here will give\nyou different notifications for\n\n228\n00:13:18.916 --> 00:13:21.003\ndifferent health statuses.\n\n229\n00:13:21.003 --> 00:13:25.093\nAnd if there is a problem with\nthat particular drive as well, but\n\n230\n00:13:25.093 --> 00:13:26.505\nthat's not all.\n\n231\n00:13:26.505 --> 00:13:31.330\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nlet's go ahead and create.\n\n232\n00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.880\nWe'll delete this one, so\n\n233\n00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.040\nwe can right-click on top of it and\nselect Delete Volume.\n\n234\n00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:41.240\nNow, let me say, if there were actual\nfiles stored on this particular volume,\n\n235\n00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.340\nI would not wanna go ahead and\n\n236\n00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.380\ndelete that volume because it would\nactually be deleting my information.\n\n237\n00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.390\nBut this is just an empty drive,\nwe just created it.\n\n238\n00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.113\nSo it's okay and it warned you.\n\n239\n00:13:51.113 --> 00:13:55.505\nSo here's the thing, and this is why\nI mentioned working in the GUI first,\n\n240\n00:13:55.505 --> 00:14:00.686\ngetting familiar with the actual functions\nis great because it says, hey, Cherokee.\n\n241\n00:14:00.686 --> 00:14:04.018\nAre you sure [LAUGH] you really wanna do\nthis because deleting this volume will\n\n242\n00:14:04.018 --> 00:14:05.226\nerase all the data on them.\n\n243\n00:14:05.226 --> 00:14:07.870\nYou better back up any data you\nwanna keep before you delete.\n\n244\n00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.650\nDo you wanna continue?\n\n245\n00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.620\nI'm gonna go ahead and select Yes.\n\n246\n00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.930\nIf I were working in other environments,\nfor instance like this part, it's a very\n\n247\n00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:20.010\npowerful utility, but it doesn't give\nme any of those kind of notifications.\n\n248\n00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.891\nSo it's kind of a one and\ndone situation and\n\n249\n00:14:21.891 --> 00:14:23.885\nthere's no getting that information back.\n\n250\n00:14:23.885 --> 00:14:26.725\nUnless you have good backups and\nat that point,\n\n251\n00:14:26.725 --> 00:14:29.940\nthat's just not a fun situation to be in.\n\n252\n00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.950\nSo let's take a look at the next type\nof volume that I wanna talk about here.\n\n253\n00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.681\nI've got a link for that as well.\n\n254\n00:14:35.681 --> 00:14:38.742\nThis is called a Spanned Volume.\n\n255\n00:14:38.742 --> 00:14:40.601\nLet me just close out of this real quick.\n\n256\n00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:44.318\nAll right, so\na Spanned Volume is going to be rare.\n\n257\n00:14:44.318 --> 00:14:49.166\nI take free space from multiple\nphysical disks or partitions and\n\n258\n00:14:49.166 --> 00:14:53.397\nI go ahead and\nlink them together to be used for storage.\n\n259\n00:14:53.397 --> 00:14:58.315\nI can have a maximum of 32 dynamic\ndisks that can be linked together\n\n260\n00:14:58.315 --> 00:14:59.877\non a spanned volume.\n\n261\n00:14:59.877 --> 00:15:01.603\nNow this is kind of interesting.\n\n262\n00:15:01.603 --> 00:15:04.679\nWe've spoke about striping, all right,\n\n263\n00:15:04.679 --> 00:15:10.495\nin the past where we would write a bit or\nso at a time to each one of those drives.\n\n264\n00:15:10.495 --> 00:15:13.886\nBut that's not what's happening\nhere with our spanned volumes.\n\n265\n00:15:13.886 --> 00:15:17.892\nLet's say I had three hard disks,\nthree physical drives,\n\n266\n00:15:17.892 --> 00:15:20.920\nthat were all part of this one volume.\n\n267\n00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.190\nSo what would happen is I would\ngo ahead and write to drive one.\n\n268\n00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.226\nOnce drive one was completely full,\nI would go ahead and\n\n269\n00:15:28.226 --> 00:15:29.719\nspill over into drive two.\n\n270\n00:15:29.719 --> 00:15:34.368\nSo, they're just kind\nof filling in that way.\n\n271\n00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:37.788\nI guess what's nice about\nthis is that you can mix and\n\n272\n00:15:37.788 --> 00:15:40.821\nmatch different types of\ndrives to go ahead and\n\n273\n00:15:40.821 --> 00:15:45.127\nmake it appear to your end users\nas one continuous storage space.\n\n274\n00:15:45.127 --> 00:15:49.076\nThere is a problem, though, there's a\ndrawback with this kind of configuration.\n\n275\n00:15:49.076 --> 00:15:54.107\nIf any one of those three drives in\nthat For instance, that I gave you were\n\n276\n00:15:54.107 --> 00:15:58.906\nto fail, you would lose all the data\nwithin that particular volume.\n\n277\n00:15:58.906 --> 00:16:02.862\nSo it's not the best solution,\nbut it is an option, so\n\n278\n00:16:02.862 --> 00:16:06.997\nlet's go ahead and\ntake a look at how we would set that up.\n\n279\n00:16:06.997 --> 00:16:12.460\nAll right,\nI have my one disk with unallocated space.\n\n280\n00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:16.129\nI'm going to need to delete, this was just\nalready preconfigured in my environment.\n\n281\n00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:18.027\nI'm gonna delete this volume,\n\n282\n00:16:18.027 --> 00:16:22.410\nbecause I need to start with unallocated\nspace here in order to do that.\n\n283\n00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:27.286\nNow, I would need to have at least\ntwo hard disk drives to create a span\n\n284\n00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:30.917\nbecause you can't span it\nif it's just one drive.\n\n285\n00:16:30.917 --> 00:16:33.570\nYou have to span it onto another one.\n\n286\n00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.291\nSo I have a couple drives here, so\nI shouldn't have a problem with that.\n\n287\n00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:38.850\nSo let's say we'll go ahead and\nstart it on disk two.\n\n288\n00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.291\nI just right click and\nselect new span volume.\n\n289\n00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:45.993\nAgain, brings up our handy dandy little\nwizard here, so we'll just go ahead and\n\n290\n00:16:45.993 --> 00:16:46.764\nclick Next.\n\n291\n00:16:46.764 --> 00:16:51.759\nSo you can see the different drives\nthat are in the current state that\n\n292\n00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:57.466\nare available for me to go ahead and\ncreate and add to this particular volume.\n\n293\n00:16:57.466 --> 00:17:00.394\nI can add both of these\nif I choose to do so, and\n\n294\n00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:03.700\nhave three disks being spanned here.\n\n295\n00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:09.391\nI will note though, these are all gonna\nbe, again, dynamic disks, you cannot add\n\n296\n00:17:09.391 --> 00:17:14.780\nbasic disks to these types of specialized\nconfigurations here, so just FYI.\n\n297\n00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:19.133\nAnd so here,\nit actually does the math for you, and\n\n298\n00:17:19.133 --> 00:17:24.170\nthe numbers we see here\nare indicated in megabytes FYI.\n\n299\n00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.231\nSo I'm able to use all of my space here,\nso\n\n300\n00:17:27.231 --> 00:17:31.870\nyou can see how that's calculated\nas well if you're curious.\n\n301\n00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.405\nThat's what those numbers indicate,\nis the actual amount.\n\n302\n00:17:34.405 --> 00:17:36.020\nWe’ll just go ahead and keep it D.\n\n303\n00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.972\nThe wizard's pretty similar for\nthe most part here.\n\n304\n00:17:39.972 --> 00:17:43.604\nYou could go ahead and\nmount it again if you choose to do so.\n\n305\n00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:47.452\nChoose your NTFS, and again.\n\n306\n00:17:47.452 --> 00:17:49.185\nwe'll hit perform a quick format so\n\n307\n00:17:49.185 --> 00:17:51.681\nwe're not stuck here all\nday looking at my screen.\n\n308\n00:17:51.681 --> 00:17:54.405\nAnd voila that was it, pretty easy.\n\n309\n00:17:54.405 --> 00:17:55.173\nWe’ll hit Finish.\n\n310\n00:17:55.173 --> 00:17:57.320\nIt will take a second here.\n\n311\n00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.443\nNow this is nice.\n\n312\n00:17:59.443 --> 00:18:02.174\nAgain I'm working in the GUI here,\nright, so\n\n313\n00:18:02.174 --> 00:18:05.265\nI'm getting these helpful\nlittle messages for me.\n\n314\n00:18:05.265 --> 00:18:10.217\nIt says hey, the operation you selected\nwill convert the selected basic\n\n315\n00:18:10.217 --> 00:18:12.581\ndisk(s) to dynamic disk(s).\n\n316\n00:18:12.581 --> 00:18:16.583\nIf you convert the disk(s) to dynamic,\nyou will not be able to start installed\n\n317\n00:18:16.583 --> 00:18:20.946\noperating systems from any volume on the\ndisk(s), except the current boot volume,\n\n318\n00:18:20.946 --> 00:18:22.642\nare you sure you wanna continue?\n\n319\n00:18:22.642 --> 00:18:26.111\nSo just kind of thinking about what we\nspoke about in that previous episode,\n\n320\n00:18:26.111 --> 00:18:30.032\nthey're warning you hear within the GUI,\nso that's why I recommend starting here.\n\n321\n00:18:30.032 --> 00:18:32.707\nI'll hit Yes, give it a second.\n\n322\n00:18:36.057 --> 00:18:39.161\nOr two, all right, purple.\n\n323\n00:18:39.161 --> 00:18:42.887\nWe’ve got purple here, and you'll notice\nthat they have different colors for\n\n324\n00:18:42.887 --> 00:18:45.222\nconfigurations to make it\na little more easier for\n\n325\n00:18:45.222 --> 00:18:48.236\nyou to identify if you're working\nwithin this interface a lot.\n\n326\n00:18:48.236 --> 00:18:51.983\nSo each one of these drives\nare part of volume D, so\n\n327\n00:18:51.983 --> 00:18:56.008\nyour end users only see it\nas one unit of storage here.\n\n328\n00:18:56.008 --> 00:19:01.379\nBut just remember, if one of these drives,\nlike if I were to select delete Volume,\n\n329\n00:19:01.379 --> 00:19:06.293\nif I suffered from one particular\nhardware failure on this disk number one,\n\n330\n00:19:06.293 --> 00:19:10.621\nthen all of that information would\nbe lost for this entire volume.\n\n331\n00:19:10.621 --> 00:19:13.503\nAnd then it does, again, give me\nthis warning to delete this volume.\n\n332\n00:19:13.503 --> 00:19:15.263\nIt’s gonna erase all the data on it.\n\n333\n00:19:15.263 --> 00:19:16.509\nAre you sure you wanna continue?\n\n334\n00:19:16.509 --> 00:19:18.927\n&gt;&gt; Now, before you do that,\ngo ahead and hit No for a moment here.\n\n335\n00:19:18.927 --> 00:19:19.805\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n336\n00:19:19.805 --> 00:19:21.653\n&gt;&gt; And then let's look above\nin that list and look for\n\n337\n00:19:21.653 --> 00:19:24.447\nthat volume, that drive-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's give ourselves\n\n338\n00:19:24.447 --> 00:19:28.631\na little more room to, you will be able to\nsee that D drive right here, all right?\n\n339\n00:19:28.631 --> 00:19:32.361\nAnd if I zoom in a little bit,\nyou can get the detailed information.\n\n340\n00:19:32.361 --> 00:19:35.421\n&gt;&gt; So now this is where you\nactually do notice the difference.\n\n341\n00:19:35.421 --> 00:19:39.721\nInstead of three different drive\nup there at the top which is how\n\n342\n00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:42.166\nthe operating system is seeing it.\n\n343\n00:19:42.166 --> 00:19:47.552\nNotice that it appears as one drive and\nhow big is the capacity there?\n\n344\n00:19:47.552 --> 00:19:48.444\n&gt;&gt; 119.74 gigs.\n\n345\n00:19:48.444 --> 00:19:49.451\n&gt;&gt; Wow, okay, so there you go.\n\n346\n00:19:49.451 --> 00:19:54.671\nSo this shows you that it has that ability\nto combine all that storage together and\n\n347\n00:19:54.671 --> 00:19:58.380\nthat's what the span volume\ngives you the ability to do.\n\n348\n00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.914\nSo across those multiple drives, now,\n\n349\n00:20:00.914 --> 00:20:03.905\nthe operating system looks\nat it as one volume.\n\n350\n00:20:03.905 --> 00:20:05.119\nIs what it looks like and\n\n351\n00:20:05.119 --> 00:20:07.930\nnot three different volumes\nis what we have access to.\n\n352\n00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:12.864\nSo it is a more powerful utility when you\nstart to actually realize I don't have\n\n353\n00:20:12.864 --> 00:20:15.660\nmoney to buy this big, gigantic disk.\n\n354\n00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.367\nBut I do have three smaller drives here.\n\n355\n00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:18.979\nI can combine them together,\n\n356\n00:20:18.979 --> 00:20:21.887\nand that reports to my\noperating system as one drive.\n\n357\n00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:22.472\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty cool.\n\n358\n00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:28.846\nLet’s go ahead and delete that one out\nnow and take a look at the next one.\n\n359\n00:20:28.846 --> 00:20:31.700\nSo we spoke about striping, right?\n\n360\n00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:37.360\nSo striping is just writing to\nmultiple disks, at least two or more.\n\n361\n00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.800\nSo let me pull up.\n\n362\n00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.030\nI've got a link for that as well here.\n\n363\n00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:44.795\nSo Microsoft does a great job\nexplaining all this, and again,\n\n364\n00:20:44.795 --> 00:20:48.434\nyou have these if you wanna read\nmore in depth about each one.\n\n365\n00:20:48.434 --> 00:20:50.890\nBut let's go ahead and\ndo full screen on this.\n\n366\n00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:51.755\nI know it's kind of small.\n\n367\n00:20:51.755 --> 00:20:53.730\nMaybe I'll even try to zoom\nin a little bit for you.\n\n368\n00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:54.507\nBut I'll explain it.\n\n369\n00:20:54.507 --> 00:20:57.170\nI’ll give you the rundown of\nwhat you're looking at here.\n\n370\n00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.983\nOops, I say that, but\nI don't mean to give you whiplash.\n\n371\n00:21:00.983 --> 00:21:04.610\nAnyways, you have the link so if you\nwanted to look at it, but I'll explain it.\n\n372\n00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.549\nAgain, you have a minimum of 2,\n\n373\n00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:11.137\nmaximum of 32 dynamic drives here when\nwe're talking our striped volumes.\n\n374\n00:21:11.137 --> 00:21:15.201\nA lot of times, admins will also\ncall this a software RAID zero,\n\n375\n00:21:15.201 --> 00:21:19.265\nbecause remember, we looked at\nRAID zero in the first show, and\n\n376\n00:21:19.265 --> 00:21:23.880\nthis is the same thing just implementing\nit from a software standpoint.\n\n377\n00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.357\nSo this is gonna be a volume\nwhere the free space from two or\n\n378\n00:21:27.357 --> 00:21:31.428\nmore physical disks are alternately\nutilized for storage space.\n\n379\n00:21:31.428 --> 00:21:33.556\nSo were striping from\neach one of those disk.\n\n380\n00:21:33.556 --> 00:21:37.260\nWe’re not filling it up like\nwe saw in that last instance.\n\n381\n00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.930\nThe data is stored equally and\nalternately on each of the physical disks.\n\n382\n00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.209\nIf a single physical disk in\nthe stripped volume fails,\n\n383\n00:21:45.209 --> 00:21:49.689\nthen again, all of our data is lost,\nso that's something to note out here.\n\n384\n00:21:49.689 --> 00:21:54.553\nI'm not implementing any form of\na redundancy with just a basic\n\n385\n00:21:54.553 --> 00:21:56.260\nstriped volume.\n\n386\n00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:01.997\nSo let's go ahead and\ncreate a striped volume here.\n\n387\n00:22:01.997 --> 00:22:03.900\nSo how many, what was my minimum Ronnie?\n\n388\n00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.730\nI had to have at least how many?\n\n389\n00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:06.465\n&gt;&gt; Three?\n\n390\n00:22:06.465 --> 00:22:07.310\n&gt;&gt; Two.\n&gt;&gt; Two.\n\n391\n00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:10.730\n&gt;&gt; Two for this one, so\nfor our Striped Volume,\n\n392\n00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.614\nnow you can have more, Ronny, yeah.\n\n393\n00:22:13.614 --> 00:22:16.970\nSo you can add more all\nthe way up to 32 there.\n\n394\n00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:18.670\nSo here again,\nI see the drives that are available to me.\n\n395\n00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:23.460\nI've got about 40 gig drive for\nDisk 2 and 40 gigs for Disk 3.\n\n396\n00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.078\nI already have a 40 gig drive.\n\n397\n00:22:26.078 --> 00:22:30.460\nSo we'll just add one this time,\nmove it on over to our selected portion.\n\n398\n00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:36.018\nSo you can see that\ncumulatively I do have about.\n\n399\n00:22:36.018 --> 00:22:40.875\nI've got 81.66 gigs of available space for\nme when I add those two together.\n\n400\n00:22:40.875 --> 00:22:43.819\nBut we'll just go ahead and\nselect Next, and\n\n401\n00:22:43.819 --> 00:22:48.950\nyou could change from this drop down to\na different letter if you chose to do so.\n\n402\n00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.600\nI've just been leaving\nit at the defaults here.\n\n403\n00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.684\nBut we'll hit Next, and again,\n\n404\n00:22:53.684 --> 00:22:58.382\nyou're selecting the same information\nwe've seen in the other screens.\n\n405\n00:22:58.382 --> 00:23:03.289\nAgain, we'll go ahead and perform a quick\nformat, and you can see how easy this is.\n\n406\n00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:07.913\nThe main thing with this,\nit's not actually configuring it.\n\n407\n00:23:07.913 --> 00:23:12.509\nIt’s knowing which configuration you\nshould use in this particular situation or\n\n408\n00:23:12.509 --> 00:23:16.305\ninstance, because you don't wanna\nback yourself into a corner and\n\n409\n00:23:16.305 --> 00:23:18.228\nend up losing information.\n\n410\n00:23:18.228 --> 00:23:20.270\nSo this is pretty cool Ronnie.\n\n411\n00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:22.423\nI do wanna point this out.\n\n412\n00:23:22.423 --> 00:23:24.418\nWhen you see the colors here and\n\n413\n00:23:24.418 --> 00:23:28.210\nwe spoke about this in when\nI was talking about RAID.\n\n414\n00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:32.490\nNotice how I have a 128 Megabytes\nof unallocated space over here?\n\n415\n00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.690\nSo, what just happened?\n\n416\n00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:39.675\nIf I look at the size, for this, what\ncolor is this, teal, would you say, aqua?\n\n417\n00:23:39.675 --> 00:23:43.049\n&gt;&gt; Green.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Whatever it is, our volume J,\n\n418\n00:23:43.049 --> 00:23:49.021\nyou can see that over here, for\ndisk 1, the size is 39.87 gigabytes.\n\n419\n00:23:49.021 --> 00:23:53.045\nNow, disk 2, 39.86 gigabytes.\n\n420\n00:23:53.045 --> 00:23:59.089\nI had left the default, which As you can\nsee, the operating system compensated for\n\n421\n00:23:59.089 --> 00:24:04.070\nmy mistake here or my oversight and\nthey said, hey, you know what?\n\n422\n00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:08.230\nThese two disks are not\nthe exact same size,\n\n423\n00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:12.200\nI started here with 50 gig or\n40 gigs, and 39.88.\n\n424\n00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.590\nSo that slight difference really,\nyou can see,\n\n425\n00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:20.640\nmade a difference here because I'm only\ngonna be using that same size drive, like\n\n426\n00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.540\nwe spoke about previously, when we were\ntalking about those RAID configurations.\n\n427\n00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.510\nSo that's kinda cool to\nsee that happen there.\n\n428\n00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.150\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ndelete this volume.\n\n429\n00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:34.090\nAnd again it just gives us our reminder\nhere, I think we've got two more to cover.\n\n430\n00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.330\nThe next one I wanna show you here\nis going to be a mirrored volume.\n\n431\n00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:43.090\nMirrored volume is just like what we spoke\nabout with our RAID configurations there\n\n432\n00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:45.070\nwhen we were talking about mirroring,\nright?\n\n433\n00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:49.470\nSo, this is gonna be where we\nhave free space that's used on\n\n434\n00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:53.540\nat least two physical disks,\nagain dynamic disks.\n\n435\n00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.560\nAny time we're creating these\nspecial configurations here,\n\n436\n00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.040\nsomething other than a basic or\nsimple disk, it's going to be dynamic,\n\n437\n00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.010\nand we're gonna use this to store\nduplicate copies of the same data.\n\n438\n00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:07.570\nSo we're really only getting,\nagain, that 50% utilization, and\n\n439\n00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:11.130\nthe data from the volume on disk one\nis gonna be duplicated to another\n\n440\n00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:14.060\nphysical disk to provide data redundancy.\n\n441\n00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:18.757\nAnd sometimes, you'll hear this also\nbeing referenced as a software,\n\n442\n00:25:18.757 --> 00:25:21.380\nRAID-1, or RAID-1 volume, okay?\n\n443\n00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.840\nSo let's go ahead and create that.\n\n444\n00:25:28.818 --> 00:25:33.808\nAll right, so from mirrored volume here,\nwe'll go ahead then launch this wizard as\n\n445\n00:25:33.808 --> 00:25:38.164\nwell and you can add like I said more than\none mirror if you choose to do so but\n\n446\n00:25:38.164 --> 00:25:39.580\nthink about it.\n\n447\n00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.910\nSo, if you have the extra money to do so\n\n448\n00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:45.560\nyou're just having additional\ncopies of that information.\n\n449\n00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:50.400\nEven if I add another disc here which\nactually I'm grayed out for some reason\n\n450\n00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.090\nI'm not able to add disk three, they're\nonly letting me have one mirror here.\n\n451\n00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:59.922\nSo, that's my limitation, but\nlet's see, let's go ahead and hit Next.\n\n452\n00:25:59.922 --> 00:26:04.386\nAnd I can go ahead and\nassign it a drive letter,\n\n453\n00:26:04.386 --> 00:26:09.600\nNTFS, Perform a Quick Format,\nand that's it.\n\n454\n00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.885\nNow remember,\nwith this type of configuration,\n\n455\n00:26:12.885 --> 00:26:15.396\nyou do have some redundancy, right?\n\n456\n00:26:15.396 --> 00:26:17.721\nSo we have an exact duplicate\nof that information, so\n\n457\n00:26:17.721 --> 00:26:20.820\nif one of these drives were to fail and\nagain I didn't change that size,\n\n458\n00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.920\nI shouldn't be using two that are the\nexact same size here to make things\n\n459\n00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.656\na little bit easy, but\nyou can see the difference.\n\n460\n00:26:26.656 --> 00:26:27.704\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee,\n\n461\n00:26:27.704 --> 00:26:30.220\nso if we end up losing one of those\ndrives we're still good then?\n\n462\n00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we're golden Ronnie, so\nthat's gonna be a good option for\n\n463\n00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.450\nus if we're looking for\nthat redundancy and\n\n464\n00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:39.820\nwe can go ahead and\nafford to have extra storage there.\n\n465\n00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:44.370\nSo let's go ahead and delete this volume\nand the last one we wanna take a look at\n\n466\n00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:49.260\nhere, this is going to be reminiscent\nof that RAID-5 configuration that we\n\n467\n00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:53.320\nspoke about in a previous episode, and\nthere's information on that as well.\n\n468\n00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:59.070\nSo remember with our RAID-5, not only\nare we going to be striping with parity,\n\n469\n00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.640\nbut we're also gonna be,\nwe're not only gonna be just striping but\n\n470\n00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.160\nwe're adding that parity bits.\n\n471\n00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.000\nSo this is gonna provide\nus some fault tolerance,\n\n472\n00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.300\nbut if you think about it logically,\nremember how we said that\n\n473\n00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.930\nwe needed at least three drives\nto have that fault tolerance?\n\n474\n00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:19.140\nWell, that's going to be the same here\nwithin our software-based implementation\n\n475\n00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:24.550\nof a RAID-5, because I can't rebuild\na new drive without parity information,\n\n476\n00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:29.870\nif I don't have enough physical hardware\nto accommodate that rebuild there.\n\n477\n00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:34.120\nSo remember, I have better read\nperformance here because of the disk\n\n478\n00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.760\nstriping but my right performance\nis gonna suffer a little bit due to\n\n479\n00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:42.090\nthe purdy calculations like we\nmentioned in that last show as well.\n\n480\n00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:44.340\nSo let's go ahead and\ncreate our RAID-5 and\n\n481\n00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:48.440\nthat'll be the last one that we\ntake a look at today and let's see.\n\n482\n00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:54.353\nWe've got at least three drives here,\nso we've got disk 1, 2, and\n\n483\n00:27:54.353 --> 00:27:59.130\n3, that can, that work just well but\nremember 39.88 is gonna be the largest\n\n484\n00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:03.770\namount of space that I can use even though\nI have 40 gigs right here for this drive.\n\n485\n00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:07.376\nSo let's go ahead and create that RAID-5\nvolume and you can see that this is,\n\n486\n00:28:07.376 --> 00:28:11.650\nthis is kind of easy here,\nit's not difficult, and\n\n487\n00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:18.320\nagain remember I do have that over head a\nlittle bit with a parity calculations and\n\n488\n00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.773\nevery third depending on how\nyou're configuring this RAID,\n\n489\n00:28:21.773 --> 00:28:24.190\nyou're just losing a little\nbit of storage as well.\n\n490\n00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:28.780\nSo we'll go ahead and walk through the\nmotion here but, nothing too crazy out of\n\n491\n00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:34.460\nthe ordinary, that's about it,\nfor our software implementations\n\n492\n00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:40.570\nof our RAID configuration, I will say\nthis though, because we are working\n\n493\n00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:45.790\nwith these disks on the operating system,\nyou are using the CPU on that machine.\n\n494\n00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:48.892\nSo that CPU, we're not offloading it or\n\n495\n00:28:48.892 --> 00:28:53.870\nputting it, that workload anywhere else,\nthat CPUs being taxed whenever it's\n\n496\n00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.610\nhandling these calculations\nespecially with parity here.\n\n497\n00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:01.660\nSo, if you have the opportunity to\ngo ahead and work with a hardware\n\n498\n00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:07.970\nRAID configuration, you are gonna see\nbetter performance in that perspective,\n\n499\n00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:13.460\nand I will also note that Disk Management\nis kinda going by the wayside.\n\n500\n00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.070\nMicrosoft is really\npushing storage pools and\n\n501\n00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:19.400\nthat's gonna be where they're really\nwanting you to kind of shift.\n\n502\n00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:23.560\nIt's the newer version of doing everything\nthat we just saw in this episode.\n\n503\n00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.520\nSo, we will take a look at that\nas well but for Disk Management,\n\n504\n00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.770\nI think that's a good start for you.\n\n505\n00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.430\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, well thank\nyou again for introducing us and\n\n506\n00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:36.210\nshowing us how we can get these different\ntypes of dynamic disk implemented,\n\n507\n00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:41.640\nthe ability to create a basic disk\nas well as a spanned, a striped,\n\n508\n00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:46.740\na mirrored, even a RAID-5 type\nof configurations as well.\n\n509\n00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:50.300\nAll these are very important aspects that\nwe can do right in the operating system\n\n510\n00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.770\nwithout additional hardware if\nwe actually choose to do them.\n\n511\n00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:57.390\nIdeally of course, in a regular\nenvironment more than likely you're\n\n512\n00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:02.160\ngonna see a hardware based RAID controller\nthat's actually right there for\n\n513\n00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.430\nyou, but if you need it this is\none way that you can do that.\n\n514\n00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:08.740\nThere is a lot more to come on\nworking with local storage, but\n\n515\n00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.810\nwe're gonna actually have that for\nour part three.\n\n516\n00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.390\nSo this is a great place to sign off for\nthis episode.\n\n517\n00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.900\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n518\n00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:16.950\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n519\n00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:24.574\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Windows Server 101 shows.\n\n520\n00:30:24.574 --> 00:30:27.299\n[MUSIC]\n\n521\n00:30:27.299 --> 00:30:29.827\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",
