ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.888 --> 00:00:14.387\nWe're launching this series to cover\nthe new SK0-004 exam and this is for\n\n4\n00:00:14.387 --> 00:00:19.364\nthe CompTIA Server+ certification which is\ntargeted towards anyone who works inside\n\n5\n00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:22.600\nof an IT data center or\nis looking to work there.\n\n6\n00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.740\nIn a smaller medium environment,\nyou may only have a handful of servers and\n\n7\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.990\nsupporting them is not much different\nthan supporting a workstation.\n\n8\n00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.850\nBut once you get into a larger\nenterprise environment,\n\n9\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.590\nmanaging large quantities of\nservers becomes pretty challenging.\n\n10\n00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.000\nAnd actually doing trouble shooting and\nwarranty repairs and server maintenance,\n\n11\n00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.590\ninstallation really becomes a very\ndifferent beast than it does with\n\n12\n00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.960\nsupporting a work station.\n\n13\n00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.550\nSo we need to understand the differences,\nunderstand how we're supposed\n\n14\n00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.940\nto handle servers and\nmake sure that they're done in a stable,\n\n15\n00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.800\nconsistent environment, which is what's\nrequired to run an enterprise data center.\n\n16\n00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.330\nSo let's take a little bit\nof a look at the exam.\n\n17\n00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.430\nFirst off, the CompTIA Server+\nexam is from CompTIA, so\n\n18\n00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.712\nit carries the same weight as A+ or\n\n19\n00:01:03.712 --> 00:01:08.630\nNET+, That it tries to give you a vendor\nneutral approach to managing servers.\n\n20\n00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.975\nThis is the SK0-004, and\nif you look on their website,\n\n21\n00:01:11.975 --> 00:01:16.183\nthey'll reference the older one,\nthe SK0-003, the previous exam.\n\n22\n00:01:16.183 --> 00:01:19.805\nThe previous exam did a great job\nof covering server technologies but\n\n23\n00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:22.680\nlike any technology,\nthey change pretty rapidly, so\n\n24\n00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.240\nin 2015 it was updated to\nreflect the new changes.\n\n25\n00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.220\nNew changes include just\nnew technologies and\n\n26\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.250\nadvancements as people move towards\nmore cloud-like infrastructure and\n\n27\n00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.910\nother technologies have kind of changed\nthe way that we look at servers.\n\n28\n00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.630\nThe exam itself hasn't\nchange as far as the format.\n\n29\n00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.300\nIt's still a 100 question multiple\nchoice computer based exam.\n\n30\n00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.170\nYou can take it Pearson vue,\ntesting centers located around the world.\n\n31\n00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.130\nIf you ever go to the vue website vue.com,\nyou can do a search for\n\n32\n00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.380\ntesting location centers that in your vue.\n\n33\n00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.290\nThey're everywhere so\n\n34\n00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.670\nyou can usually find them within maybe\na 45 minute drive of where you're at.\n\n35\n00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.540\nWhen you take the exam,\nit is a 90 minute exam.\n\n36\n00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.950\nSo 100 questions, only 90 minutes.\n\n37\n00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.680\nYou're expected to know the data, to be\nable to move through that pretty quickly,\n\n38\n00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.610\nless than one minute per question.\n\n39\n00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.640\nSo you've gotta get that done.\n\n40\n00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.970\nBut it is scaled where you\nonly need 750 points to pass.\n\n41\n00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.220\nSo you can get a handful wrong and\nstill be all right.\n\n42\n00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.870\nAs far as a prerequisite,\n\n43\n00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.180\nyou don't have to be working in a data\ncenter to get a Server+ certification, but\n\n44\n00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.590\nthey do expect you to at least\nhave the A+ certification.\n\n45\n00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.300\nYou need to understand\nhardware components.\n\n46\n00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.380\nUnderstand how a hard drive works,\nhow network adapters work.\n\n47\n00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.000\nUnderstand the basic hardware\ncomponents of any system.\n\n48\n00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.460\nAnd then we're gonna look at it\nfrom the server side of things.\n\n49\n00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.890\nSo you can learn and get ready for that.\n\n50\n00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.800\nThe typical target candidate is going to\nhave 18 to 24 months of IT experience or\n\n51\n00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.030\nthe equivalent of that experience.\n\n52\n00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.980\nYou might not even working in IT but\nif you've studying, practicing,\n\n53\n00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.858\ndoing this as a hobby from home, you may\nalready have the same level of experience,\n\n54\n00:02:53.858 --> 00:02:55.590\nand you'll be ready to move right in.\n\n55\n00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.250\nIf you find yourself getting\noverwhelmed with Server+,\n\n56\n00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.230\nyou can always take a step back and\njump down to A +.\n\n57\n00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.690\nThey don't mention it here but\nI do recommend Network+ also.\n\n58\n00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.720\nIf you have A+ and Network+,\nyou'll have a great foundation and\n\n59\n00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.060\nnone of the topics in\nServer+ will blow your mind.\n\n60\n00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.590\nIt's really just enhancing, building on\ntop of those topics that you learned from\n\n61\n00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.550\na work station perspective and\nmoving into the server level.\n\n62\n00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.940\nNow from there, the certification exam,\nitself is $294 USD, if you're in the US.\n\n63\n00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.160\nBut if you're outside of the US, the\npricing is all right here on the webpage.\n\n64\n00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.940\nIt is just one exam, which is nice.\n\n65\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.460\nOne exam, you pass, and\nyou get your Server+ certification.\n\n66\n00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.180\nSo a great certification to have.\n\n67\n00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.640\nAs far as getting ready for\nthe exam, well,\n\n68\n00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.320\nthere's plenty of content out\nthere like The ITProTV content.\n\n69\n00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.580\nAnd what we do is we cover\neach of the objectives, and\n\n70\n00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.980\nwe do it thoroughly to make sure\nyou prepared for that exam.\n\n71\n00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.980\nNow the content is broken\nup into seven domains,\n\n72\n00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.090\neach domain covering a different\narea of server technologies.\n\n73\n00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.370\nAnd you'll see that each one\nis kind of subdivided and\n\n74\n00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.710\nweights a different amount on the exam.\n\n75\n00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.090\nSo for example, server architecture,\nwhich is just general concepts for\n\n76\n00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.540\nhow server environments are built out,\nis 12% of the exam.\n\n77\n00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.740\nBut server administration, keeping the\nservers running, that's 24% of the exam.\n\n78\n00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.250\nIt's almost a quarter of the exam\nright out of that one objective.\n\n79\n00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.362\nStorage is another 12%,\nwe've got security beyond that for 13%,\n\n80\n00:04:16.362 --> 00:04:19.743\nnetworking at 10%,\ndisaster recovery is only 9%, and\n\n81\n00:04:19.743 --> 00:04:24.454\nthat's because a lot of IT workers are not\ninvolved in the disaster recovery process\n\n82\n00:04:24.454 --> 00:04:28.998\nthat we have, security, or information\nsecurity officers that are handling.\n\n83\n00:04:28.998 --> 00:04:33.421\nAnd if you're in the ISO type role, or\nCISO type role, you'll be heavily involved\n\n84\n00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:37.273\nin that, but if you're working in the NOC,\nyou might be responsible for\n\n85\n00:04:37.273 --> 00:04:42.120\ndetecting the disaster, but not\nactually resolving or resuming from it.\n\n86\n00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.230\nAnd then troubleshooting is another 20%,\nbecause once our servers are up and\n\n87\n00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.130\nrunning they have a habit\nof not staying that way.\n\n88\n00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.510\nSo, we need to be able to troubleshoot,\nisolate the problems, and\n\n89\n00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.580\nget them back up and\nrunning and healthy again.\n\n90\n00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.750\nSo, a distribution here is not very even,\nright?\n\n91\n00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.255\nThe bulk of the exam questions are gonna\ncome from server administration and\n\n92\n00:04:59.255 --> 00:05:03.410\ntroubleshooting and then the other ones\nget kind of sprinkled across from there.\n\n93\n00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.590\nNow each of these domains is\nbroken up into a ton of topics and\n\n94\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.350\nif I went over them here this\noverview would be an hour long.\n\n95\n00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.720\nBut if you go to CompTIA's website\nyou can download the exam objectives,\n\n96\n00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.830\nthis list right here.\n\n97\n00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.100\nIt will show you each one.\n\n98\n00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.040\nSo for example, server architecture covers\nform factors, components, cooling and\n\n99\n00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.100\npower, all those different things that are\ninside of the servers and make them go.\n\n100\n00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.080\nServer administration,\nhow do we install an operating system?\n\n101\n00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.380\nWhat are the different server\nroles available, and so on?\n\n102\n00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.380\nAll of this is broken down,\nand it is, at first,\n\n103\n00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.900\nan intimidating amount of information.\n\n104\n00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.650\nBut you'll there actually is a bit of\noverlap between them as you go through and\n\n105\n00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.740\nso all starts to kind of snap together but\n\n106\n00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.070\nthey've divided it up to\nmake it easier to consume.\n\n107\n00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.580\nI can focus in on one area.\n\n108\n00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.610\nI'm gonna focus just\non server maintenance.\n\n109\n00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.720\nI'm not worried about installation and\ndisaster.\n\n110\n00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.490\nLet's just do maintenance and then as each\none goes you learn more and more they\n\n111\n00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.810\nbuild on top of each other and before\nyou know it, you're ready for that exam.\n\n112\n00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.720\nI do encourage you to go to CompTIA's\nwebsite and download the exam objectives.\n\n113\n00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.260\nIt's a great way to, to just track\nyour own training to make sure.\n\n114\n00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.079\nYou've learned each of\nthe topic as you go through.\n\n115\n00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:11.550\nNow once you've studied your content,\nyou're ready to take the exam.\n\n116\n00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.560\nAnd if you're an ITProTV subscriber,\n\n117\n00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.540\nyou've got access to practice\nexams through Transcender right?\n\n118\n00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.590\nWe have those available as\npart of your subscription and\n\n119\n00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.750\nwe also have practice labs available,\nwhere you can fire up servers and\n\n120\n00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.990\nactually run through some step\nby step exercises on Windows and\n\n121\n00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.990\nLinux based systems to reinforce\nthe knowledge that you're learning here.\n\n122\n00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.150\nSome of the knowledge is hardware based,\nthough.\n\n123\n00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.470\nAnd so during the show we do our best to\nbring a real server up here on the screen,\n\n124\n00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.470\nand actually show you how to perform\nmaintenance, and other activities,\n\n125\n00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.930\non the physical box, cuz you might\nnot have one that's available to you,\n\n126\n00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.640\nalthough you can go on eBay and\npick them up pretty inexpensively, or\n\n127\n00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.870\nif you work for\nan organization that already has servers,\n\n128\n00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.500\nthey may have older ones that you can\nexperiment with and kind of get used to\n\n129\n00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.270\ninstead of practicing on the production\nservers which is always dangerous.\n\n130\n00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.330\nAll right, well if all of that\nsounds exciting to you and\n\n131\n00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.660\nthis is what you wanna learn,\nyou're in the right place.\n\n132\n00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.000\nWe're gonna be tackling it\nall in the upcoming episodes.\n\n133\n00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.300\nAgain, if it sounds a little intimidating,\ndon't worry.\n\n134\n00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.750\nReach out to A+, reach out to Net+\nfirst and once you get through those,\n\n135\n00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.460\nthe rest of this just builds right\non top and it's not a big deal.\n\n136\n00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.552\nBut if you're here to learn about servers,\n\n137\n00:07:13.552 --> 00:07:16.951\nstay tuned because the Server+\nepisodes are starting coming up next.\n\n138\n00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.262\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:10.900\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV\n\n4\n00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.067\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:16.320\nWelcome to another exciting episode here\nat ITProTV, I'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.794\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\nthrough our series in CompTIA Server+.\n\n7\n00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:24.030\nAnd joining us in the studios today\nis none other than, Mr. Don Pizet.\n\n8\n00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.130\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.996\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great Wes,\nready to dive right into Server+ and\n\n10\n00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:30.763\nwe're going to kick things off\nwith kind of a neat topic.\n\n11\n00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:33.586\nA lot of you that are here watching\nthe show are people who have worked with\n\n12\n00:00:33.586 --> 00:00:34.380\nservers for years.\n\n13\n00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.440\nAnd you're just pursuing the Server+\ncertification, and that's awesome.\n\n14\n00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.930\nBut many of you haven't worked\nwith servers much at all, and\n\n15\n00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.080\nthis is your first chance you'd\nexpose them, and see them.\n\n16\n00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.370\nAnd so, it makes sense that our\nfirst episode would focus, really,\n\n17\n00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.460\nkind of on the differences of\na server versus a workstation.\n\n18\n00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.310\nAnd so we're gonna talk about\none of the primary differences,\n\n19\n00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.910\nwhich is the form factor.\n\n20\n00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.308\nServers come in a lot of\ndifferent shapes and sizes, and\n\n21\n00:00:56.308 --> 00:00:58.051\nthey're way different than desktops.\n\n22\n00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:00.810\nAlthough, desktops come in a lot\nof different shapes and sizes,\n\n23\n00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.400\nlittle tiny ones,\nreally big ones, whatever.\n\n24\n00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.770\nServers, though,\ndon't have as much flexibility,\n\n25\n00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.690\nthat you can't come in too many\ndifferent sizes, because they're gonna\n\n26\n00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.630\ngo into a data center that's gonna have\nracks like what you see behind me.\n\n27\n00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.530\nAnd if we expect the server to fit in\nour rack, then it's gonna have to follow\n\n28\n00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.120\na couple of standard measurements\nin order for that to work.\n\n29\n00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.244\nIf you start going nonstandard,\npeople get really angry and\n\n30\n00:01:22.244 --> 00:01:24.750\nit makes it hard to support the servers,\npeople won't buy them.\n\n31\n00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.810\nSo there's really just a few\ndifferent form factors that we see in\n\n32\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.690\nthe server world.\n\n33\n00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.370\nWe're gonna take a look at those\nright here in this episode.\n\n34\n00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.820\n&gt;&gt; So Don you mentioned,\nfor instance, PCs right?\n\n35\n00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.330\nThey have different form factors going\nback to like the early days of the AT and\n\n36\n00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.040\nthen the ATX standard that's\nbeen around forever now.\n\n37\n00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.170\nAnd it always talks about size,\nshape, and characteristics.\n\n38\n00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.480\nIs that what we're looking at when we talk\nabout form factors in servers, as well?\n\n39\n00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.120\n&gt;&gt; Yea, absolutely.\n\n40\n00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.510\nWe're gonna to focus on the external\nstuff, you know, the size, and\n\n41\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.420\ncharacteristics and\nall that in this episode.\n\n42\n00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.280\nIn our next episode,\nwe're gonna go on the internal.\n\n43\n00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.530\nWe'll talk about CPU and RAM and\nhard drive, brake controllers, and\n\n44\n00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.140\nall that other magic,\nthe guts of the server.\n\n45\n00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.180\nBut on the outside,\n\n46\n00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.340\njust the cases alone are different\nthan what we see in a work station.\n\n47\n00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.840\nThe main difference, where I wanna kick\nthis one off, is that when you buy\n\n48\n00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.920\na server the majority of servers out\nthere, what are called rack mount servers.\n\n49\n00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.148\nThey're servers that are designed to\nbe put in high density environments.\n\n50\n00:02:18.148 --> 00:02:21.731\nWhen you but a workstation, you can put it\non your desk or under your desk, right?\n\n51\n00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:23.772\nHow many people sit at that desk?\n\n52\n00:02:23.772 --> 00:02:25.024\nOne person.\n\n53\n00:02:25.024 --> 00:02:26.948\nYeah I mean, you might have two\npeople sharing the same chair,\n\n54\n00:02:26.948 --> 00:02:28.012\nbut that's not normally happen.\n\n55\n00:02:28.012 --> 00:02:30.114\nUsually everybody has their\nown little work space, and\n\n56\n00:02:30.114 --> 00:02:33.000\nthe workstation is able to occupy\nas much of it as they want.\n\n57\n00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.950\nWell, servers, they don't go under a desk,\nwell at least they shouldn't.\n\n58\n00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.470\nThey go in a data center.\n\n59\n00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.220\nAnd in a data center every square\nfoot costs precious dollars.\n\n60\n00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.200\nit's expensive to maintain a data center.\n\n61\n00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.940\nYou have to have subfloor, air\nconditioning, cooling, cable management.\n\n62\n00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.380\nJust the general maintenance of it,\nyou have to have special fire control,\n\n63\n00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.650\nthere's all sorts of\ncrazy things you need.\n\n64\n00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.130\nSo everything needs to fit in as\nsmall of footprint as possible.\n\n65\n00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.391\nSo we can't do tower server.\n\n66\n00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:06.980\nI use the word can't,\nwhich is a little permanent.\n\n67\n00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.270\nYou can do tower servers,\n\n68\n00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.480\na tower server would be a server\nthat looks a lot like a desktop.\n\n69\n00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.160\nIt's usually just a really big desktop.\n\n70\n00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.380\nIn fact, here, instead of just saying it,\nlet me show you guys an example.\n\n71\n00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.064\nI've got pulled up here Dells,\nDell sells a lot of servers, Dell and\n\n72\n00:03:21.064 --> 00:03:24.303\nHP really are the two big ones,\nor it's HPE now.\n\n73\n00:03:24.303 --> 00:03:25.940\nYou have Lenovo.\n\n74\n00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.557\nWhoops, apparently I'm gonna zoom.\n\n75\n00:03:27.557 --> 00:03:31.686\nYou have Lenovo out there also that is\nselling a lot of servers these day,\n\n76\n00:03:31.686 --> 00:03:34.940\nwhat used to be IBM, but\nDell is pretty prevalent.\n\n77\n00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.010\nAnd they do see tower servers.\n\n78\n00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.950\nSo I can see some tower\nservers right here.\n\n79\n00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.800\nThey sit on the floor, so\nit's got a little set of,\n\n80\n00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.050\nthat's convenient,\na little set of legs right here.\n\n81\n00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.080\nAnd this server stands up,\nkind of like a desktop chassis, right?\n\n82\n00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.570\nBut it's somewhat misleading, because when\nyou buy a tower server from Dell, what\n\n83\n00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.100\nit really is, is a rack mount server, they\nstuck some legs on the side of it, right?\n\n84\n00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.814\nIf you were to pop the legs\noff of this server and\n\n85\n00:04:02.814 --> 00:04:07.490\nturn it sideways, it would be a rack mount\nserver that could go inside of a rack.\n\n86\n00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.630\nThere are a few that aren't like that,\nusually the low-end super cheap ones.\n\n87\n00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.154\nBut the servers that\nare actually worth a dollar,\n\n88\n00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:18.714\nthose are gonna be rack mount servers\nthat have been turned sideways.\n\n89\n00:04:18.714 --> 00:04:21.330\nDell's being creative with it,\nIt's kinda neat.\n\n90\n00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.330\nThe logo on the face plate, on a lot of\nthem you can take it, and twist it, and\n\n91\n00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.670\nturn the logo sideways, so\n\n92\n00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.190\nyou can actually convert a tower server\ninto a rack, or a rack to a tower.\n\n93\n00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.540\nNow, with all that in mind,\nI said you can't do a tower server.\n\n94\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.020\nWhy would I say something dumb like that,\nwhen they sell them right here?\n\n95\n00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.040\nWell, it's not they\ncan't do a tower server,\n\n96\n00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.140\nit's that you shouldn't do a tower\nserver in most environments.\n\n97\n00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.330\nIn most environments, a tower server\nhas to sit on the floor, right?\n\n98\n00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.683\nIt takes up a lot of room.\n\n99\n00:04:45.683 --> 00:04:47.670\nHow many can you fit on your floor?\n\n100\n00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.650\nYou can only fit so many, and\nyou can't stack them on top of each other.\n\n101\n00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.100\nSo tower servers are really only suitable\nin environments where you just have one or\n\n102\n00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.410\ntwo servers, right?\n\n103\n00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.720\nMaybe you work in a small\ndentist office and\n\n104\n00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.860\nyou've got five employees,\nyou have one file server.\n\n105\n00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.000\nAre you gonna need a rack\nin a data center for that?\n\n106\n00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.668\nNo, so you could get a tower server and\nstick in a closet somewhere and\n\n107\n00:05:08.668 --> 00:05:10.460\noff you go, it make sense there.\n\n108\n00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.430\nBut, in this series we're\ntalking about data centers.\n\n109\n00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.930\nWe're talking about enterprise\nserver environments, and\n\n110\n00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:16.850\nyou're not gonna have one server.\n\n111\n00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.600\nYou're gonna have a few hundred servers.\n\n112\n00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.680\nAnd when you have a few hundred servers,\nyou can't have them just lined up\n\n113\n00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.680\nacross the floor unless you just happen\nto have giant airplane hangars, or\n\n114\n00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.380\nsomething that are available and\nspace is not an issue for you.\n\n115\n00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.670\nFor most of us space is an issue.\n\n116\n00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.910\nSo instead, we're gonna take our servers\nand we're gonna put them into racks.\n\n117\n00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.200\nAnd they're going to stack\nright on top of each other.\n\n118\n00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.790\nThey're designed to do that.\n\n119\n00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.780\nWhen the manufacturers design servers,\n\n120\n00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.050\nthey are designed to stack\nright on top of each other.\n\n121\n00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.150\nThere's a number of concerns with\nthat that they've thought about,\n\n122\n00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.320\nthey've already planned around that\nyou might be thinking about right now.\n\n123\n00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.850\nFor example, a computer tends to\nput out a lot of heat, doesn't it?\n\n124\n00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.538\nThe CPU generate heat,\nthe hard drive generates heat,\n\n125\n00:05:57.538 --> 00:06:02.250\nthe power supply generate heat and\nheat rises, heat goes up.\n\n126\n00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.180\nSo in a desktop, we don't care about that.\n\n127\n00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.851\nIn a laptop, we don't care about it,\nbecause the heat goes up and\n\n128\n00:06:06.851 --> 00:06:08.670\nit's just up in the air.\n\n129\n00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.770\nBut if I had a server stacked\non top of each other and\n\n130\n00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.410\nheat goes up, what's happening?\n\n131\n00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.780\nThe heat's just passing into\nthe next server above it.\n\n132\n00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.875\nSo the servers get progressively\nhotter the higher up they are, and\n\n133\n00:06:17.875 --> 00:06:21.582\neventually you get thermal shutdowns and\nshortened lifespans of the hardware.\n\n134\n00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:22.860\nWell, they know that.\n\n135\n00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.130\nThe people who manufacture these servers,\nthey know that.\n\n136\n00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.760\nAnd so when they build rack mount servers,\n\n137\n00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.790\nthey're designed to move air very\nefficiently right through them.\n\n138\n00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.840\nBringing air in the front of the server\nand blowing it out the back of the server.\n\n139\n00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.920\nAnd so, when you have all these\nservers stacked on top of each other,\n\n140\n00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.790\nthey're all sucking in air from the front,\nand they're all blowing air out the back.\n\n141\n00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.020\nAnd that makes it we have a nice air\nflow running right through the stack.\n\n142\n00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.405\nAnd the server at top of the rack will\nusually not be more than one degree hotter\n\n143\n00:06:52.405 --> 00:06:54.990\nthan the service that are way\ndown at the bottom of the rack.\n\n144\n00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.517\nAnd it's just because of\nthat efficient air flow.\n\n145\n00:06:57.517 --> 00:07:00.760\nSo they've already planned for it, and\nyou can load that rack up with equipment.\n\n146\n00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:07.160\nNow the other challenge we have are the\nracks, that if we're going to be stacking\n\n147\n00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.690\nthese servers on top of each other,\nwe're going to need racks to hold them.\n\n148\n00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.680\nAnd there's a number of different\ncompanies out there that make racks.\n\n149\n00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.302\nI brought up Dell, Dell makes racks.\n\n150\n00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:17.980\nHP or HPE, they have their own racks.\n\n151\n00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.620\nUsually, though the big ones that we\nsee aren't from either manufacturer.\n\n152\n00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.760\nThat there's a lot of other companies\nthat specialize in manufacturing racks.\n\n153\n00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.355\nThere's companies like Great Lakes,\nthere is Middle Atlantic,\n\n154\n00:07:31.355 --> 00:07:34.811\ntendency to name after bodies of water,\nI guess.\n\n155\n00:07:34.811 --> 00:07:37.352\nThere are companies like APC.\n\n156\n00:07:37.352 --> 00:07:41.200\nThe APC that makes UPSs and\nother types of power devices.\n\n157\n00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.700\nThey have a whole infrastructure line\nwhere they make all this various data\n\n158\n00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.290\ncenter equipment.\n\n159\n00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.810\nIt's really impressive stuff.\n\n160\n00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:47.878\nSo when you buy a rack,\n\n161\n00:07:47.878 --> 00:07:51.373\nyou're not necessarily buying it from\nthe manufacturer of the service.\n\n162\n00:07:51.373 --> 00:07:54.805\nIf you look behind us,\nwe have a mixture of equipment back there.\n\n163\n00:07:54.805 --> 00:07:57.440\nWe have an HP server or\ntwo stuck in there.\n\n164\n00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.476\nActually, I don't think we have\nany Dell servers in there.\n\n165\n00:07:59.476 --> 00:08:01.666\nWe've got a bunch of\nGrass Valley equipment, and\n\n166\n00:08:01.666 --> 00:08:03.920\nit's all mounted in these\nMiddle Atlantic racks.\n\n167\n00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.120\nIt's just different vendor after\ndifferent vendor after different vendor.\n\n168\n00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.700\nBut fortunately, in the data world,\nracks are pretty standard\n\n169\n00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:16.970\nthat when you buy a rack, they're all\nconsistently going to be 19 inches wide.\n\n170\n00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.810\nSo you've got 19 inches of width in a rack\nand a server needs to conform to that.\n\n171\n00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:25.670\nSo when you buy a server,\nthey're almost always 19 inches wide.\n\n172\n00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.290\nIf you take a tape measure,\nand measure them out, so\n\n173\n00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.500\nthey'll be able to fit in these racks.\n\n174\n00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.440\nThe only variation you really have\nis that when the servers slide in,\n\n175\n00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.070\nthey have to screw into the rack,\nto kind of lock them in place.\n\n176\n00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:40.030\nAnd some racks have little circular holes\nwhere you actually put the screws right\n\n177\n00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.700\ninto them, which forces you\nto use a certain threading.\n\n178\n00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.540\nAnd then other racks have a square hole,\n\n179\n00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.880\nwhere you put a little nut on the back\nend that gives it the threading.\n\n180\n00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.050\nThe square hole is more common.\n\n181\n00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.330\nAnd the main reason for that is,\nhere in the United States,\n\n182\n00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.360\nwe buy a lot of servers.\n\n183\n00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.490\nAnd we still use the old imperial\nsystem of measurement, right?\n\n184\n00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:03.080\nWe use inches and centimeters,\ncentimeters, that's metric.\n\n185\n00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.790\nBut we use inches and feet and\nall that crazy stuff.\n\n186\n00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.790\nBut when you get into Europe or\nreally the whole rest of the world,\n\n187\n00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.710\nthe metric system is king.\n\n188\n00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.620\nAnd so, they use millimeters and\ncentimeters and\n\n189\n00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.180\nit's a different unit of measurement.\n\n190\n00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.300\nEven the threading on\nthe screws is different.\n\n191\n00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.970\nAnd so, if you buy racks where it actually\nhas the round screw holes in them,\n\n192\n00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.940\nit has to be threaded for your system.\n\n193\n00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.360\nAnd if it's not,\nyou've gotta buy screws for\n\n194\n00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.630\na different system than what\nyour country might use.\n\n195\n00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:32.490\nWith the square holes,\nyou can put the nut that's appropriate for\n\n196\n00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.150\nyour country on there and\nit makes a lot more sense.\n\n197\n00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.900\nThat's why you see the square holed\nones more often in the data world.\n\n198\n00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.700\nIt's different in the audio and\nbroadcast world.\n\n199\n00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.810\nLike if you go to a TV station, TV\nstations, they almost always get the ones\n\n200\n00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.900\nwith the circular holes in them cuz\nthey have a lot more money, I guess.\n\n201\n00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.030\nThey don't mind buying the right screws\nfor the right rack and going that route.\n\n202\n00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:52.690\nSo in the audio world and\nthe video world, things are different.\n\n203\n00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.870\nBut in the computer world, the square\nholed racks are the most common, and\n\n204\n00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.640\nthey're 19 inches wide.\n\n205\n00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.550\nNow when you buy a server,\nwhoever manufactured that server,\n\n206\n00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.670\nthey're going to have\n19 inches to work with.\n\n207\n00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.140\nAnd what can you get done\nin only 19 inches of width?\n\n208\n00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.990\nWell, actually quite a lot, right?\n\n209\n00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.500\nBecause it's not just the width,\nbut you've also got the depth and\n\n210\n00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.410\nthe height of the server.\n\n211\n00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.740\nWhen we go on a shop rack mount servers,\nI'll pull up Dell's rack mount server\n\n212\n00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:22.590\npage, and you start to look at them,\na lot of the servers are pretty small.\n\n213\n00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.600\nIf you look at these, like that's three\nservers stacked on top of each other.\n\n214\n00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.810\nAll right?\nThose are pretty small servers.\n\n215\n00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:28.780\nBut if we start scrolling down,\n\n216\n00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.890\nyou'll start to see where\nthey get a little bit bigger.\n\n217\n00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.900\nAnd then they start to get even bigger,\n\n218\n00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.800\nuntil you get to servers\nthat are really quite large.\n\n219\n00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.380\nAnd what's happening is that the more\nmemory, the more processor power,\n\n220\n00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.400\nthe more whatever it is they need, they\njust make the server taller and taller and\n\n221\n00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.960\ntaller to make room for it.\n\n222\n00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.890\n&gt;&gt; Don, something I noticed real fast\nwhile you were scrolling through there is\n\n223\n00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.990\nthere seems to be a consistency\nin the description.\n\n224\n00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.656\nWe see this number and then a U.\n\n225\n00:10:53.656 --> 00:10:55.000\nCan you tell us a little bit about that?\n\n226\n00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.830\nWhat does that mean?\n\n227\n00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.180\nI've noticed a couple\ndifferent numbers there.\n\n228\n00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n229\n00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.680\nSo what Wes is talking\nabout is if you look here,\n\n230\n00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.760\nyou'll see this 1U Entry Rack Server.\n\n231\n00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.950\nOr some of these other\nones say 2U Rack Server.\n\n232\n00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:12.610\nDown here we probably have 3 or\n4, it doesn't even say on these.\n\n233\n00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:17.170\nBut these larger ones here will be 4U,\nor 3U, they start to grow.\n\n234\n00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:21.470\nThat U, short for unit and even that's an\nabbreviation cuz it's supposed to be RU.\n\n235\n00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:22.663\nRU is a rack unit.\n\n236\n00:11:22.663 --> 00:11:25.380\nSo these are 1RU, 2RUs, a 3RU.\n\n237\n00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.830\nIf you just call it a unit\nwhat the heck is that?\n\n238\n00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.150\nIt could be unit of anything.\n\n239\n00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.865\nIt could be 50 cents g-unit,\nwe don't even know.\n\n240\n00:11:32.865 --> 00:11:36.323\nBut an RU is a rack unit and\nthat's what we are dealing with here.\n\n241\n00:11:36.323 --> 00:11:40.051\nA rack unit is this weird unit of measure\nthat we use just in data centers.\n\n242\n00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:42.506\nI don't know how this came up,\nwhat the history is.\n\n243\n00:11:42.506 --> 00:11:46.713\nBut a single rack unit is 1.75 inches.\n\n244\n00:11:46.713 --> 00:11:50.245\nSo one and\nthree-quarters of an inch is a rack unit.\n\n245\n00:11:50.245 --> 00:11:53.395\nSo when you get a one unit server,\nit is only one and\n\n246\n00:11:53.395 --> 00:11:56.090\nthree-quarter inches tall, 1RU.\n\n247\n00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.630\nThe server that I've got sitting on\nthe table here in between Wes and I,\n\n248\n00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.110\nthis guy right here is a 1RU server.\n\n249\n00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:04.042\nSo it is only 1.75 inches tall.\n\n250\n00:12:04.042 --> 00:12:08.380\nAnd it's 19 inches wide,\nfilling up the entire width of the rack.\n\n251\n00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.500\nAlmost every server will be 19 inches wide\nbecause they don't wanna waste that space.\n\n252\n00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.160\nThey're gonna use every bit they can get.\n\n253\n00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.210\nAnd if they make it thin, they're\ngonna have a hard time getting it to\n\n254\n00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.310\nscrew into the rack cuz you'll\nhave little wings on the side.\n\n255\n00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:22.570\nSo almost every server is\na full 19 inches wide.\n\n256\n00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.440\nSo the only places where you see\nvariation is the height, right?\n\n257\n00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.260\nYou might get a server that's 2U or\n3U, right?\n\n258\n00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.160\nIt gets taller or whatever.\n\n259\n00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.020\nAnd then the depth,\nthe length of the thing.\n\n260\n00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:37.140\nAnd if you look at this server,\nthis server is a full length server.\n\n261\n00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.600\nIt's kinda hard to see here.\n\n262\n00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.240\nIf we were stand it up,\nthis thing is very, very tall.\n\n263\n00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.240\nSo it's gotta be a full meter, right?\n\n264\n00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.350\nMaybe two and a half,\nthree feet something like that.\n\n265\n00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:55.080\nIt's pretty tall, so it's 19 inches wide,\nonly 1.75 inches tall.\n\n266\n00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:59.310\nBut this depth gives it a ton of room for\nhard drives,\n\n267\n00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.450\nprocessors, memory, power supply.\n\n268\n00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:05.500\nAll the things that you gotta\njam inside of this box.\n\n269\n00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.650\nWell, what if I wanna\nhave four processors.\n\n270\n00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:12.910\nWhat if I want to have 32 memory slots.\n\n271\n00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:16.680\nWhat if I wanna have 4 power supplies and\n16 hard drives.\n\n272\n00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.420\nHow are you gonna fit all that?\n\n273\n00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.620\nYou make the server taller.\n\n274\n00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:25.325\nSo it goes from 1U to 2U, to 3U, to 4U,\nand it starts getting taller and\n\n275\n00:13:25.325 --> 00:13:27.000\ntaller and taller.\n\n276\n00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.070\nIn fact, when you start getting into some\nof those servers that have 64 processors\n\n277\n00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:34.820\nin them, those things will be 20U,\n24U, so they will fill up half a rack.\n\n278\n00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.620\nOne server will fill half a rack.\n\n279\n00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.123\nA standard rack just, I don't think\nit is on the exam, but just so\n\n280\n00:13:40.123 --> 00:13:42.540\nyou know, is 42U in heighth, right.\n\n281\n00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.126\nSo 42 U it's a little over,\n\n282\n00:13:44.126 --> 00:13:48.321\nI think it's approaching seven feet\ntall somewhere right around seven feet.\n\n283\n00:13:48.321 --> 00:13:51.260\nBut 42U is pretty much\nthe standard height.\n\n284\n00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.740\nYou can get ones that are taller.\n\n285\n00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.640\nYou can get ones that are shorter.\n\n286\n00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.450\nThey make half racks and so on,\nbut 42U's pretty standard and\n\n287\n00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:01.800\nif you have a server that is 24U that's\ngonna fill up more than half of that rack.\n\n288\n00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.590\nAnd they do make them.\n\n289\n00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.500\nThey're incredibly expensive,\nbut they do make them.\n\n290\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.420\nNormally, though, the servers that\nwe work with these days are all 1U.\n\n291\n00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:14.020\nAnd the reason is, in the olden days,\nwhen you needed something to run fast,\n\n292\n00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.910\nif you had software that had\nto run faster and faster and\n\n293\n00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.810\nfaster, you bought a bigger and\nbigger server.\n\n294\n00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:21.940\nYou bought a server with more memory,\nand with more processors.\n\n295\n00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.530\nToday everybody builds for scalability.\n\n296\n00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.290\nRight, we can thank the whole\n.com boom for that.\n\n297\n00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:33.080\nThat instead of having one really\nbig server, we might have ten or\n\n298\n00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.690\n20 really small servers.\n\n299\n00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.120\nSo we just keep adding 1U servers.\n\n300\n00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.950\nAnd the reason that works out better is\nbecause every time we start seeing growth\n\n301\n00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.340\nin our company or our customers or\nwhatever it is that's increasing\n\n302\n00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.590\nutilization on our system, we just buy\nanother server and stick it in the rack.\n\n303\n00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:50.040\nAnd then it gets busier,\nbuy another server, stick it in.\n\n304\n00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.050\nAnd you just keep going like that,\n\n305\n00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.530\nexpanding, versus having to\nreplace the server every time.\n\n306\n00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's one of\nthe things I was gonna ask Don,\n\n307\n00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.250\ndoes it make it a little\nbit more redundant?\n\n308\n00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:00.470\nBecause if you've got a single server like\nyou were saying that takes up half of\n\n309\n00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:04.500\nan entire rack, I can only imagine the\nastronomical expense that that would be if\n\n310\n00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.570\nthat server fails, versus one of them and\njust modually stacking them on each other.\n\n311\n00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:09.100\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n312\n00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.760\nI mean, redundancy is a part of it, right?\n\n313\n00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.140\nThe trade-off is complexity.\n\n314\n00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.210\nYou've got more servers to\nsupport versus having just one.\n\n315\n00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:18.330\nBut the other thing is, when you talk\nabout buying a bigger and bigger server,\n\n316\n00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.150\nthat's called scaling up, right?\n\n317\n00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.360\nSo I'm scaling up.\n\n318\n00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.040\nI'm increasing the size of that server.\n\n319\n00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.640\nEventually you hit a limit.\n\n320\n00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.290\nRight?\n\n321\n00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.256\nWe'll use Dell's page.\n\n322\n00:15:28.256 --> 00:15:29.784\nLet's say that money is no object.\n\n323\n00:15:29.784 --> 00:15:32.750\nI want the best server\nthat I can get from Dell.\n\n324\n00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.600\nSo I'm here, I'm on their server page.\n\n325\n00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.730\nI guess I'm in the small business page but\nwe'll stick with it.\n\n326\n00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.740\nAnd I'm gonna go down here to the R930.\n\n327\n00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:46.180\nThe PowerEdge R930 Rack Server, that\nseems to be their highest premium one.\n\n328\n00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:50.261\nAnd if we start to spec this thing out,\nthere's only so much we can do to it.\n\n329\n00:15:50.261 --> 00:15:53.927\nIt's only got enough room for\na certain amount of hard drives, and\n\n330\n00:15:53.927 --> 00:15:55.968\na certain number of CPUs, and so on.\n\n331\n00:15:55.968 --> 00:16:00.426\nSo if I just take the most expensive\none And choose to customize it.\n\n332\n00:16:00.426 --> 00:16:02.322\nThis is always fun.\n\n333\n00:16:02.322 --> 00:16:05.190\nHow much of somebody else's\nmoney can I spend here.\n\n334\n00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.510\nNow we're already at almost $16,000.\n\n335\n00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:09.230\nAnd we haven't even done\nanything too crazy with it.\n\n336\n00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.580\nTrusted platform module I'm\nnot really worried about that.\n\n337\n00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.000\nProcessors, here we go.\n\n338\n00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.370\nSo on the processor side it\ncomes with two Intel processors.\n\n339\n00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:23.660\nSo if I want the best and\nlet's find the best.\n\n340\n00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:30.310\nThe best that they've got right now\nis looks like, these Xeon E7's that\n\n341\n00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:35.720\nhave 60 megs of cache and which makes\nsure I'm actually picking the best one.\n\n342\n00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.030\nYeah 24c480, that'd be good.\n\n343\n00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.820\nAll right.\n\n344\n00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.070\nSo I'm picking this guy right here.\n\n345\n00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.450\nI am at the top of the line\nthere with those two processors.\n\n346\n00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.580\nAnd down here, I can add a third and\nfourth processor.\n\n347\n00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.430\nSo I'll upgrade that, so\n\n348\n00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:53.440\nnow I've got four CPUs, what about\nsix CPUs, what about eight CPUs?\n\n349\n00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.430\nThat's not an option here, right?\n\n350\n00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:56.800\nThey're griping at me\nhere about something.\n\n351\n00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.790\nNot enough power supplies.\n\n352\n00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.380\nNow I gotta increase\nmy power supplies too.\n\n353\n00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.530\nAnd that'll be the other limitation.\n\n354\n00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.760\nI can only add so many CPUs, cuz I need\nto have enough power to drive them.\n\n355\n00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.530\nSame thing with hard drives.\n\n356\n00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.200\nYou can only have so many hard drives\nbefore you start running out of power, but\n\n357\n00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.980\nyou also only have so\nmuch room that you can fit in the server.\n\n358\n00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:16.970\nSo right here my limitation if i'm\nscaling up is going to be 8 CPUs.\n\n359\n00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.340\nI can't get about 8 CPUs on this.\n\n360\n00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:25.800\nBut if scaled out instead I might have\na server that is the longest CPUs.\n\n361\n00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.070\nAnd that I add another three now I got\nfour servers which are total eight CPUs\n\n362\n00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.450\njust like this one box I specced out.\n\n363\n00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.630\nThe price will probably be the same.\n\n364\n00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.930\nBut now I can add a 5th server, and\na 6th server, and a 20th server, and\n\n365\n00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.620\nI can scale out way further\nthan I can scale up.\n\n366\n00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.250\nSo it ends up being better in the long\nrun, and that's the way we normally go.\n\n367\n00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:48.900\nSo these days for me, it is a rarity, that\nI deploy a server that's more than one u.\n\n368\n00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:53.027\nIt's just not very common, because people\ndesign software to scale out these days.\n\n369\n00:17:53.027 --> 00:17:54.241\nThey didn't used to do that.\n\n370\n00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:58.622\n&gt;&gt; So if I am gonna purchase a server,\nwhy would I even choose then, Don,\n\n371\n00:17:58.622 --> 00:18:02.170\nby contrast a rack mount\nserver in today's day and age?\n\n372\n00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.770\nWhat would be it's benefits?\n\n373\n00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.670\nAs far as the you know,\nnot the rack amount I'm sorry.\n\n374\n00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:07.332\nI meant the.\n\n375\n00:18:07.332 --> 00:18:08.694\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just saying,\n\n376\n00:18:08.694 --> 00:18:09.210\nwe just talked about it.\n\n377\n00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:13.340\nI meant the blade servers is what I\nreally meant, why would I invest in\n\n378\n00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.680\nthat technology if it does seem to\nhave a certain amount of limitations.\n\n379\n00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nyou mention blade technology and\n\n380\n00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.310\nblade technology is\nreally kind of different.\n\n381\n00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:27.420\nBlade technology is It's\none of those technologies\n\n382\n00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.380\nthat they've been tooting for years that\neverybody needs to deploy blade servers.\n\n383\n00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:37.440\nAnd the cost isn't quite right if you're\njust gonna do five or ten servers.\n\n384\n00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.940\nBut if you're gonna do 50 servers, or 100\nservers, you can deploy blade servers and\n\n385\n00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.390\nyou can save a lot of money.\n\n386\n00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:44.980\nAnd if you've never\nheard of blade servers,\n\n387\n00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.720\nlet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n388\n00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.160\nDell has some blade servers but\nI like HP's better.\n\n389\n00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.800\nSo I'm on HP's blade system page.\n\n390\n00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.860\nAnd what they're showing here\nis a picture of a blade server.\n\n391\n00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.206\nAnd at first glance, when you look at it,\nit looks like one big server, doesn't it?\n\n392\n00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.330\nBut what it really is, is a chassis.\n\n393\n00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.690\nA big box.\n\n394\n00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:09.610\nAnd the box has several slots in it,\nthat you can then pop blades into it.\n\n395\n00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:15.800\nAnd so in this picture what I'm seeing are\nblades, sitting right here on the ground.\n\n396\n00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.100\nAnd then here's the big chastise\nthat's holding these blades.\n\n397\n00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.750\nAnd so you've got, let's see, one, two,\nthree, four, five, six, seven, eight.\n\n398\n00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.220\nNow we've got 16 blades right here.\n\n399\n00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.400\nThat's 16 servers,\nI've got 16 servers in this box.\n\n400\n00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.070\nNow how can we do that?\n\n401\n00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.000\nHow can we get 16 servers\nin this amount of space?\n\n402\n00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.080\nWell, inside of each blade there's\ngoing to be a couple of hard drives,\n\n403\n00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.970\nsmall laptop style hard drives.\n\n404\n00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:40.490\nRight?\nBut\n\n405\n00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:44.590\nthey're not the cheap hard\ndrives you see in laptops.\n\n406\n00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:48.060\nThey're going to be SSDs or they'll be\n7200, 10,000 or 15,000 RPM SCSI drives.\n\n407\n00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.950\nThey're just in a small form factor.\n\n408\n00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.720\nSo a lot of times they're SAS drives,\nserial attached SCSI drives; so\n\n409\n00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.950\nthey're very expensive, very fast drives.\n\n410\n00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.920\nPeople make a mistake of thinking\nthat a lot top drives and\n\n411\n00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.360\ncheap garbage do not\nincorporate expensive.\n\n412\n00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.960\nSo web cap lounge is in there,\nusually just for the operating system.\n\n413\n00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.290\nAnd then there will be a couple of CPUs\nand a couple of sticks and memories.\n\n414\n00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:14.160\nAnd after that there will be a fibre\nchannel that will be connected to a cell.\n\n415\n00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.380\nThey get all the real\nstorage from the sand.\n\n416\n00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.970\nAnd they'll get their networking and\nother access.\n\n417\n00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:23.730\nNow if you look at the back of this\ncard though, it won't have PCI slots or\n\n418\n00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:24.880\nwhatever for adding things.\n\n419\n00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:29.110\nInstead it's got a common adapter that\nplugs into the back plane of this chassis.\n\n420\n00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:33.110\nAnd down here at the bottom,\nyou've got power supplies and\n\n421\n00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.940\nnetwork infrastructure that is\nshared across all the blades.\n\n422\n00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.600\nSo by connecting the chassis to the SAN,\n\n423\n00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.280\nall the blades are now\nconnected to the SAN.\n\n424\n00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:47.570\nAnd it's expensive to deploy it in the\nbeginning, but after you've deployed about\n\n425\n00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:50.710\n15 or 20 servers, you hit that breaking\npoint where it now becomes cheaper.\n\n426\n00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.340\nWith each blade you deploy,\nyou're now saving money.\n\n427\n00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:57.340\nIt's all in a very small, compact area and\n\n428\n00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.240\nthey can share resources which\nmakes it more efficient.\n\n429\n00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.640\nIt is kind a hard to see\nhere just in this diagram so\n\n430\n00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:07.282\nI let me show you something if you\nhave a bored and you have time go to\n\n431\n00:21:07.282 --> 00:21:12.780\ndellenterprise demos.com.\n\n432\n00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.490\nIt is a website that the Dell resellers\nuse to advertise their products to kind\n\n433\n00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.430\na do demonstrations and\nshow off their products.\n\n434\n00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:24.380\nBut when you go to that site,\nthey have a new little interactive tour.\n\n435\n00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.610\nYou can do of their equipment.\n\n436\n00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:28.400\nYou can browse and look at that their\nrack servers, and their tower servers,\n\n437\n00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.150\ntheir blade servers and so on.\n\n438\n00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:32.270\nI'm wanna put the blade servers.\n\n439\n00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.612\nStill you can see it's a huge\nexample of your blade rack.\n\n440\n00:21:34.612 --> 00:21:39.650\nIt's cassis and you have a blade the pop\nin adobe you can need with theirs.\n\n441\n00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.950\nIn that some of their\nblades are the half size,\n\n442\n00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:47.850\nlike we saw on HP's, but\nthen some of their blades are full size.\n\n443\n00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.370\nSo if I need some extra\nhard drives in one, or\n\n444\n00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:55.670\nif I need four CPUs instead of two I can\nget a larger blade which pops in there,\n\n445\n00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:57.530\nversus the smaller blade\nwe're seeing on the right.\n\n446\n00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:03.460\nAnd in this picture Don, if we don't need\nto populate all of those empty bays,\n\n447\n00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.620\ndo they blank plate them and\njust like they would in a rack mount?\n\n448\n00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.330\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yeah these are fully populated\nbecause it's marketing material.\n\n449\n00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:12.680\nBut in real life land, you almost always\nhave at least a few blanks in there\n\n450\n00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.430\nthat you just haven't populated yet.\n\n451\n00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.640\nCuz when you buy the chassis,\nyou're planning for growth, right?\n\n452\n00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.690\nNow that's a bit of a double edged\nsword because when you're planning for\n\n453\n00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:23.550\ngrowth, that means I'm\ngonna have empties here and\n\n454\n00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:26.990\nmaybe they stopped selling that blade\nby the time I'm ready to grow, right?\n\n455\n00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.490\nSo from that scenario,\n\n456\n00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.560\nI know a lot of companies where they\nonly buy these fully populated.\n\n457\n00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:35.290\nAnd they say, look, if we need 20 servers,\nwe'll buy this full.\n\n458\n00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.070\nBut otherwise, we'll buy regular servers.\n\n459\n00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.140\nThat way we can mix and match if need be.\n\n460\n00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.090\nDell's done a good job,\n\n461\n00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:44.790\nand HP, with making it where you can mix\ngenerations of blades in a single chassis.\n\n462\n00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:47.910\nBut that does bring some challenges there.\n\n463\n00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.280\nBut the blanking panels are important\ncuz it controls air flow.\n\n464\n00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.250\nWe'll talk more about air\nflow in the next episode.\n\n465\n00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:56.150\nNow the neat thing about this demo,\ncuz so far it's just a picture,\n\n466\n00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.330\nif you click around on this stuff\nIt does some really cool things.\n\n467\n00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:04.190\nIt gets all three dimensional here and\nstarts popping things out and\n\n468\n00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:05.910\nletting you see inside of it and all.\n\n469\n00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:07.890\nAnd this is what I really wanted\nto show you, cuz if you look,\n\n470\n00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:09.320\nhere's one of those half blades.\n\n471\n00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.810\nSo this is a half blade.\n\n472\n00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.250\nIt's got two or\nfour hard drives in the front.\n\n473\n00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:15.050\nI wasn't paying attention,\nso I didn't see.\n\n474\n00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.100\nAnd then after that\nwe've got memory slots.\n\n475\n00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:21.760\nAnd if you look,\nthis one has 24 memory slots.\n\n476\n00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.600\nThat is a lot of memory sticks in there.\n\n477\n00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.190\nThis thing can have a lot of RAM.\n\n478\n00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:28.520\nIt's got two CPU slots.\n\n479\n00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.570\nBut when you look to the back,\nit just has this one connector.\n\n480\n00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.100\nIt doesn't have.\n\n481\n00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.920\nFiber optic connectors, RJ-45.\n\n482\n00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:39.060\nIt doesn't even have USB ports for\na keyboard and mouse.\n\n483\n00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:42.460\nAnd that's because it's plugging\ninto a common back plane and\n\n484\n00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.750\nit's sharing that connection with all\nthe other blades on that chassis.\n\n485\n00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.719\nAnd so\nyou can really get economies of scale.\n\n486\n00:23:48.719 --> 00:23:53.461\nCisco makes special switch modules that\npop right into the back of these chassis.\n\n487\n00:23:53.461 --> 00:23:56.245\nYou might have a Dell blade server,\nan HPE blade server,\n\n488\n00:23:56.245 --> 00:23:59.087\nWith a Cisco switch actually\nstuck right in the back of it.\n\n489\n00:23:59.087 --> 00:24:00.413\nSo the switch is embedded,\n\n490\n00:24:00.413 --> 00:24:03.850\nnow you don't even have to run\npatch cables between these things.\n\n491\n00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:07.040\nIt's just the switch is natively in there,\nit's really neat stuff that you can do.\n\n492\n00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.634\nAnd when it comes to\nsoftware defined networking,\n\n493\n00:24:09.634 --> 00:24:11.280\nthis is really the heart of it.\n\n494\n00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.139\nBecause you might have five blades\nthat are tied to one customers,\n\n495\n00:24:14.139 --> 00:24:16.285\nanother two blades tied\nto another customer, and\n\n496\n00:24:16.285 --> 00:24:18.395\nthey're completely\nisolated from each other.\n\n497\n00:24:18.395 --> 00:24:21.330\nThey don't even realize they're\nrunning in a common chassis.\n\n498\n00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:25.050\n&gt;&gt; Don, I know that in other episodes\nyou've mentioned how we use typically\n\n499\n00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:28.830\nremote technologies to manage these\ndevices, but at the physical level on\n\n500\n00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:32.560\nthese blades, how is it that you gain\naccess to the different [INAUDIBLE]?\n\n501\n00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.740\nHow do you manage them?\n\n502\n00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.563\n&gt;&gt; So, these things are managed\na few different ways.\n\n503\n00:24:35.563 --> 00:24:38.449\nThe way you're supposed to do it\nwhen things are working right,\n\n504\n00:24:38.449 --> 00:24:39.900\nis you remote into the servers.\n\n505\n00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.496\nIf they're Linux servers, you SSH in.\n\n506\n00:24:41.496 --> 00:24:43.760\nIf they're Windows servers,\nuse Remote Desktop.\n\n507\n00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:48.090\nAnd you never actually go and physically\ntouch the box, you do everything remotely.\n\n508\n00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:51.050\nNow, if things aren't working right, or if\nyou just haven't installed the operating\n\n509\n00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:54.800\nsystem yet, then that's where you rely\non the remote management of the vendor.\n\n510\n00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.660\nSo, HPE uses what are called\nlights out boards,\n\n511\n00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.470\nthey call them integrated lights out,\nor iLO.\n\n512\n00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:03.094\nThe iLo boards that let you remote in and\nconnect, and\n\n513\n00:25:03.094 --> 00:25:06.360\nit's kind of like a cavium where\nyou are actually seeing the screen\n\n514\n00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.068\nof the device without even\nbeing in the same room as it.\n\n515\n00:25:09.068 --> 00:25:11.436\nDell has the same thing except\nthey have what's called a DRAC,\n\n516\n00:25:11.436 --> 00:25:12.800\na Dell remote access card.\n\n517\n00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.160\nAnd the DRAC does the same thing, lets\nyou see the screen as if a monitor and\n\n518\n00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.700\nkeyboard and mouse were attached to it.\n\n519\n00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.860\nMeanwhile, you're sitting at\nyour desk in your office and\n\n520\n00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.690\nyou're seeing all these via web page.\n\n521\n00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.650\nSo, that's how you can get the initial\noperating system installed.\n\n522\n00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:25.740\nBut after that, you just remote\ninto the operating system and\n\n523\n00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.800\nwork with it just like any other server.\n\n524\n00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.320\nOn the network, these appear no\ndifferent than any other server.\n\n525\n00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.440\nAnd we've seen that they've got hardware\nthat's on the same level as any other\n\n526\n00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.360\nserver.\n\n527\n00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.630\nSo, there's really not\nmuch of a difference that\n\n528\n00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:42.070\nyou can save a lot of money,\nyou can minimize your infrastructure,\n\n529\n00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:45.230\nyou can really fit a lot of service in\nthe small amount of space by doing this.\n\n530\n00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:50.220\nBut it is still 19 inches wide and it's\ndesigned to fit in that standard rack.\n\n531\n00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.890\nNow, this might be 12U tall, or\nI think this is actually 10U.\n\n532\n00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:58.385\nBut it can be a lot taller to hold this\nby you can stack chassis on top of each\n\n533\n00:25:58.385 --> 00:26:03.061\nother, fill up a rack and have a ton of\nservice right there on a single rack.\n\n534\n00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:06.371\nAnother thing worth mentioning,\nI said one year servers are really common.\n\n535\n00:26:06.371 --> 00:26:11.391\nSo, when I go back to my rack servers,\nand we pull up some of those, they\n\n536\n00:26:11.391 --> 00:26:17.690\nshow a rack here that's populated with\na mixture of some 2U, some 1U, and so on.\n\n537\n00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:20.330\nSee how they fully populated this rack?\n\n538\n00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:25.170\nThere's a server in every single slot,\nin real life land,\n\n539\n00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:28.250\nyou don't see that very often, and\nthere's a few reasons for that.\n\n540\n00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:31.747\nOne is temperature, even though air is\nmoving through here really well that's\n\n541\n00:26:31.747 --> 00:26:34.107\na lot of temperature to have\njammed in one small area.\n\n542\n00:26:34.107 --> 00:26:36.460\nSo, that's one reason.\n\n543\n00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:42.230\nThe other reason is if you have a server\nfail, you've gotta slide it out and cable\n\n544\n00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:45.910\nmanagement with this many servers and\nthis density becomes really challenging.\n\n545\n00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:47.440\nNot impossible, it can certainly be done,\n\n546\n00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.220\nit just becomes challenging,\nit's difficult to maintain.\n\n547\n00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.840\nThe other thing is,\nthe sheer weight of the rack.\n\n548\n00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.463\nThe rack starts to get really heavy, so\nyour floor has to be designed to handle\n\n549\n00:26:56.463 --> 00:26:58.766\nthat, it has to be designed\nto handle that load.\n\n550\n00:26:58.766 --> 00:27:02.930\nIt is also a tip risk,\nright, a rack can tip over.\n\n551\n00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.190\nThe more weight that's in the rack,\n\n552\n00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:07.350\nespecially up towards the top the more\nrisk that that's introducing.\n\n553\n00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:11.264\nSo, normally what you'll see is the\nservers might be spaced out with some gaps\n\n554\n00:27:11.264 --> 00:27:14.169\nor all the servers are down at\nthe bottom part of the rack and\n\n555\n00:27:14.169 --> 00:27:17.107\nyou'll normally see networking\ngear up towards the top.\n\n556\n00:27:17.107 --> 00:27:20.004\nBecause all these servers need to\nplug into a switch somewhere, and so\n\n557\n00:27:20.004 --> 00:27:22.361\nyou'll typically see a switch\nat the top of every rack and\n\n558\n00:27:22.361 --> 00:27:24.970\nthen those switches will run\nback to a core somewhere.\n\n559\n00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:28.990\nSo, these type of server deployments\nwhere every slot is full, they look\n\n560\n00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:33.720\ngreat in marketing material, but in real\nlife land, that's not terribly common.\n\n561\n00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.833\n&gt;&gt; Don, one of the things I'm thinking,\njust kinda looking back here at the back\n\n562\n00:27:36.833 --> 00:27:39.587\nof this little server here is that\nthere are a ton of ports back there.\n\n563\n00:27:39.587 --> 00:27:42.660\nI can only image if you've\ngot four power supplies.\n\n564\n00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.540\nYou've got redundant network adapters.\n\n565\n00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:47.310\nYou've got a lot of cables coming\noff the back of these servers.\n\n566\n00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.191\nHow do we keep these managed?\n\n567\n00:27:48.191 --> 00:27:50.690\nHow do we keep these rack mount\nservers managed on the back?\n\n568\n00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so on a lot of them,\nthey'll come with cable management arms.\n\n569\n00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.972\nThese little I always call\nthem accordion things, but\n\n570\n00:27:56.972 --> 00:28:01.400\nthey're really shaped like a v\nthat can stretch out like this.\n\n571\n00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.970\nAnd it attaches to the back of\nthe server and it attaches to the rack.\n\n572\n00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:09.277\nAnd so, you run the cabling all along this\nv-shaped item, so, it just runs along.\n\n573\n00:28:09.277 --> 00:28:12.745\nAnd when you slide the server out,\nit extends, and so\n\n574\n00:28:12.745 --> 00:28:14.990\nnow the cable is run out straight.\n\n575\n00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.500\nAnd when you push it back, it folds up.\n\n576\n00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.220\nIn theory, they work really well,\n\n577\n00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.220\nin real life they don't\nactually work all that great.\n\n578\n00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.640\nBut they do keep the cables isolated,\nand if you have somebody standing behind\n\n579\n00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.300\nthe rack making sure the cable management\narm doesn't get in the way, and\n\n580\n00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.900\nsomebody on the front of\nthe rack sliding the server out,\n\n581\n00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.540\nthen it will kind of goes pretty well.\n\n582\n00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.029\nSo, you just kind of have\nto work around that but.\n\n583\n00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.680\nBut basically when it\ncomes to these things,\n\n584\n00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.800\nthere's usually in a two sets\nof hardware that come with it.\n\n585\n00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.950\nOne is gonna be a cable management arm for\nthe back, not every server comes with it,\n\n586\n00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:45.716\nbut a lot of them do.\n\n587\n00:28:45.716 --> 00:28:48.190\nAnd the other thing is a rail kit.\n\n588\n00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:51.280\nThe rail kit are long metal rails,\n\n589\n00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.400\nthat bolt the side of the server,\nand then they attach to the rack.\n\n590\n00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.722\nNow, the rack has four post, two post\nin the front, two post in the back.\n\n591\n00:28:57.722 --> 00:29:01.160\n19 inches apart,\nwith the screw holes along the sides.\n\n592\n00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.950\nAnd the rails have little ball bearings,\nso they can slide in and\n\n593\n00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:08.960\nout, because if these servers are all\nstacked, and I need to do work on one,\n\n594\n00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.870\nI've gotta slide it out of\nthe rack to do work on it.\n\n595\n00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:17.279\nWell, when you slide it out,\nyou can't slide it out half-way.\n\n596\n00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:21.240\nLet me stand this server back up again,\nand I'll show you what I mean.\n\n597\n00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.980\nSo, the face plate of this server is\ngoing to be pointing straight down.\n\n598\n00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.290\nSo, that would be at\nthe front of the rack.\n\n599\n00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:30.940\nIf I wanted to do work on this server,\nI would have to slide it out.\n\n600\n00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:34.050\nWell, the opening for the server\nwhen I open it, which I'll do in\n\n601\n00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:38.050\nthe next episode, starts right here and\nthis whole back panel comes off.\n\n602\n00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:41.380\nIt comes off by sliding this way.\n\n603\n00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:46.640\nSo, if I only slide the server halfway\nout the rack, I can't get this panel off.\n\n604\n00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.447\nI've got to slide it not even just here,\n\n605\n00:29:49.447 --> 00:29:52.759\nI have to slide it out\nbeyond the end of the rack.\n\n606\n00:29:52.759 --> 00:29:56.906\nI've gotta get this server dangling\nfull out the front of the rack so\n\n607\n00:29:56.906 --> 00:30:01.400\nthat I can take this panel off and\nget the equipment inside of it.\n\n608\n00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.990\nNow, when you do that, that is dangerous.\n\n609\n00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:06.170\nYou've got a server.\n\n610\n00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:07.213\nThere's a lot of weight to this.\n\n611\n00:30:07.213 --> 00:30:11.062\nThe hard drive's on the front, so\nthis thing is front-heavy, and\n\n612\n00:30:11.062 --> 00:30:13.980\nnow I've got it dangling out of a rack.\n\n613\n00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:16.070\nAll this weight,\njust sticking right out the front.\n\n614\n00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:21.690\nSo, the rails are usually\nmade of reinforced steel that\n\n615\n00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:26.010\nare designed to be able to hold the entire\nweight of the server at full extension,\n\n616\n00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:28.110\nbecause the rail will\nbe made of two pieces.\n\n617\n00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:31.240\nAnd as it slides, the first piece\nis sliding out on bearings, and\n\n618\n00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.670\nthen the second piece\nslides out on bearings.\n\n619\n00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:36.930\nSo, that one piece becomes very,\nvery long, and\n\n620\n00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:38.610\nit's got to support all this weight.\n\n621\n00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:41.580\nSo, those rails are really important.\n\n622\n00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.958\nDell, HPE, Lenovo,\nthey all sell rail kits, and\n\n623\n00:30:44.958 --> 00:30:48.820\nthey usually cot 2 to $300,\nAnd people balk at that.\n\n624\n00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:53.880\nI'm not gonna pay $300 for rails,\nI can get $20 rails on Amazon.\n\n625\n00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.340\nYou can, and\neventually you're gonna get really hurt\n\n626\n00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.050\ncuz those are just not\ndesigned to handle the weight.\n\n627\n00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:02.730\nYou need to get the good ones or\n\n628\n00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:04.540\nyou need to not work on servers\nwhile they're in the rack.\n\n629\n00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:06.950\nCuz you could just slide it out and\ntake it all the way out and\n\n630\n00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.490\nwork on it over on a workbench or\nsomething, and do that.\n\n631\n00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:12.200\nBut if you use the factory rails, they are\ndesigned to hold the weight of the server.\n\n632\n00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say, I don't think\nmy back could handle any of that.\n\n633\n00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.360\nBut it also makes sense too, Don,\n\n634\n00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.580\nthat just the investment alone is worth it\nbecause of the price that you could pay in\n\n635\n00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.020\nthose servers as you were\njust adding four CPUs.\n\n636\n00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:24.610\nI think that was $7000 it\nadded to the package alone.\n\n637\n00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:25.731\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n638\n00:31:25.731 --> 00:31:27.216\n&gt;&gt; So, it does look like a $200\n\n639\n00:31:27.216 --> 00:31:30.560\ninvestment definitely is worth it\nto protect quite a few thousand.\n\n640\n00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n641\n00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:34.415\nThe other thing is that when you buy\na rack, almost all of them have wheels on\n\n642\n00:31:34.415 --> 00:31:37.714\nthe bottom, so you wheel them into place\nand then they have these little metal\n\n643\n00:31:37.714 --> 00:31:40.428\nfeet that you unscrew that drop\ndown to kind of lock it in place.\n\n644\n00:31:40.428 --> 00:31:43.918\nWell, if your rack is fully\npopulated with servers, and\n\n645\n00:31:43.918 --> 00:31:47.117\nyou start to slide more than\none server out at a time,\n\n646\n00:31:47.117 --> 00:31:51.718\nyou can exceed the tipping limit for\nthat rack and the rack can tip and fall.\n\n647\n00:31:51.718 --> 00:31:55.829\nIf it falls, and you're in the way,\nYou don't survive that.\n\n648\n00:31:55.829 --> 00:31:59.410\nAnd it is a lot of waves, so\nit is an extremely dangerous thing.\n\n649\n00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:04.060\nSo if you have a fully populated rack,\nit really needs to be bolted to the floor.\n\n650\n00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.310\nWhere that get challenging is,\n\n651\n00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.758\nin most data centers you\ndon't have a normal floor.\n\n652\n00:32:07.758 --> 00:32:10.756\nWe're kinda fortunate here that we do,\nbut normally you have a subfloor.\n\n653\n00:32:10.756 --> 00:32:13.530\nYou have removable panels,\na foot and half, or\n\n654\n00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:16.200\ntwo foot of distance between you and\nthe actual floor.\n\n655\n00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.270\nSo when that server rack\ngets bolted to the floor,\n\n656\n00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:21.690\nit's being bolted to tiles that\nare designed to be removable.\n\n657\n00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:24.738\nSo it's really gonna be bolted\nway down into the concrete.\n\n658\n00:32:24.738 --> 00:32:26.290\nYour data center has to be designed for\n\n659\n00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:28.380\nthat if you're gonna\nfully populate the racks.\n\n660\n00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:31.480\nOtherwise you need to pull\nthe engineering documents for\n\n661\n00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.750\nyour rack, determine the tipping weight,\nand read a.\n\n662\n00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.560\nThey'll explain how it's\nsupposed to be loaded.\n\n663\n00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:39.191\nAnd you might find that, yes,\nyou've got a 42U rack, but\n\n664\n00:32:39.191 --> 00:32:42.280\nyou can't put 42U of equipment\nin there and maintain safety.\n\n665\n00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.618\nSo always read the safety instructions\nthat come with those racks,\n\n666\n00:32:44.618 --> 00:32:45.529\nit's really important.\n\n667\n00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:49.730\nI can't stress it enough,\nit is really, really important.\n\n668\n00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:53.040\nAfter that,\nmost of it is pretty cut-and-dry.\n\n669\n00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.630\nThese servers are designed for\ngood airflow.\n\n670\n00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:58.810\nWhen you buy racks,\na lot of them have doors.\n\n671\n00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:02.270\nYou might notice that none of our racks in\nthe background here have doors on them.\n\n672\n00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:06.050\nAnd we don't do that just to make them\nlook pretty, although it does [LAUGH].\n\n673\n00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:08.490\nWe do it because that's\nhow you maximize airflow.\n\n674\n00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.950\nDoors are really optional on a rack.\n\n675\n00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:14.860\nWhen you go to some of those really\nstate-of-the-art, pretty server rooms,\n\n676\n00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.280\nthey'll have doors on the front of their\nracks, and those obstruct airflow.\n\n677\n00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.870\nNow they usually have holes in them,\nthey're ventilated, right?\n\n678\n00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:24.320\nBut if you've got excess air conditioning,\nthen you can survive through that,\n\n679\n00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.240\nand that's fine.\n\n680\n00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.650\nBut don't feel like you have\nto have doors on your racks.\n\n681\n00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:31.060\nIf you have multiple tenants in an area,\nyou might need doors to be able to lock\n\n682\n00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.820\nthem, to stop people from getting to\nthe physical front of the servers.\n\n683\n00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.450\nTower servers will have that,\na little lock on the front.\n\n684\n00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:39.220\nRack servers may have that,\n\n685\n00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.140\nyou'll see where the faceplates\nmight have a little lock on them.\n\n686\n00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.189\nDell does that with all theirs,\nI don't know if HP does, they might.\n\n687\n00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:49.042\nBut that's all stuff to think about.\n\n688\n00:33:49.042 --> 00:33:53.857\nAnd faceplates, more and more vendors are\nmoving away from faceplates these days.\n\n689\n00:33:53.857 --> 00:33:55.986\nWhere the front of the server is\njust the front of the server, and\n\n690\n00:33:55.986 --> 00:33:57.800\nthere's not a removable faceplate on it.\n\n691\n00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.690\nBut Dell still does faceplates, and that's\nwhy they're able to have a lock on there.\n\n692\n00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:02.280\nAnd that's why I said,\nI don't know if HP does,\n\n693\n00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:06.460\nbecause they don't typically\ndo faceplates on theirs, so.\n\n694\n00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.770\nAll right, I think it's\na pretty good run down on this.\n\n695\n00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:13.072\nLet's see, we've talked about blade\ntechnologies we've talked about the rack\n\n696\n00:34:13.072 --> 00:34:15.639\nmounts, and\nwe've talked about tower mounts.\n\n697\n00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:18.139\nThe web pages I went to here were\njust examples to show you guys,\n\n698\n00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:19.895\nI'll post links for\nthem in the show notes.\n\n699\n00:34:19.895 --> 00:34:21.815\nBut you can browse to any vendor.\n\n700\n00:34:21.815 --> 00:34:25.858\nLenovo, Dell, HPE,\nthey're probably the three big ones.\n\n701\n00:34:25.858 --> 00:34:28.514\nThere's plenty of other organizations\nthat make servers, though.\n\n702\n00:34:28.514 --> 00:34:30.333\nThese days, thanks to the cloud,\n\n703\n00:34:30.333 --> 00:34:33.608\na lot of people aren't buying\nservers in the volume they did.\n\n704\n00:34:33.608 --> 00:34:36.624\nSo the smaller server vendors\nhave kind of started to go away,\n\n705\n00:34:36.624 --> 00:34:39.063\nand you end up with this\nhandful of big companies.\n\n706\n00:34:39.063 --> 00:34:43.400\nBut they make great stuff, HPE servers\nare some of the best on the market, and\n\n707\n00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.549\nthey do a really good job with theirs.\n\n708\n00:34:45.549 --> 00:34:49.000\nSo if you need on-premises equipment,\nyou can shop the three vendors.\n\n709\n00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.670\nYou'll see they're all pretty standard,\nthey all use Intel processors,\n\n710\n00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:55.130\nbecause they work the best\nin the server environments.\n\n711\n00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:58.270\nThey all follow standard rack sizes and\ndimensions.\n\n712\n00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:02.000\nThey usually are spec'd pretty similar,\nso it's finding which ones have the best\n\n713\n00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.090\nwarranty and support, is usually\nhow you make that final decision.\n\n714\n00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:06.670\n&gt;&gt; A lot of great information, Don, here.\n\n715\n00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:09.200\nWe talk, here at ITPro.TV,\na lot about software.\n\n716\n00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.030\nSo it's nice to step behind the scenes and\n\n717\n00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:14.592\nsee some of the actual hardware that's\ndoing some of the heavy lifting here.\n\n718\n00:35:14.592 --> 00:35:17.770\nDon, it does look like we're coming to\nthe end of another wonderful episode.\n\n719\n00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:18.790\nBut before we sign off,\n\n720\n00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:21.470\ndo you got any additional words that\nyou'd like to throw in with this one?\n\n721\n00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:23.790\n&gt;&gt; That's about it for\nserver form factors.\n\n722\n00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:26.870\nThere are some nonstandard ones out there,\nI'm not gonna cover them here,\n\n723\n00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:28.410\nbecause in real life you don't buy them.\n\n724\n00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:30.620\nBut there are some that you'll encounter.\n\n725\n00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:33.640\nAnd there's plenty of servers that\nare way shorter than this one, but\n\n726\n00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.410\nit just depends on how much\nhardware it needs inside of it.\n\n727\n00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:39.690\nSo there are variations out there,\ndon't assume they're all the same.\n\n728\n00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:42.520\nBut that's it, and if you're wondering\nwhen we're gonna get to the good stuff,\n\n729\n00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.680\nstay tuned for the next episode.\n\n730\n00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.558\nCuz that's where we're gonna go\ninside inside the servers and\n\n731\n00:35:45.558 --> 00:35:46.880\nstart talking about the components there.\n\n732\n00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.569\nAnd things get to be a little\nmore interesting on that one, so\n\n733\n00:35:49.569 --> 00:35:50.450\nstay tuned for it.\n\n734\n00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:52.480\n&gt;&gt; Great information,\nDon, thank you for that.\n\n735\n00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.710\nThank you for the viewer watching.\n\n736\n00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:56.100\nLooking forward to\nthe additional hardware episode.\n\n737\n00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:59.320\nSigning out for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n738\n00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.111\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don

00:00:06.325\n[INAUDIBLE]\n\n4\n00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:08.389\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.164\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.164 --> 00:00:14.618\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.618 --> 00:00:16.028\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:16.028 --> 00:00:20.195\nAnd in today's episode, we're coming back\nat you with more of CompTIA Server+ and\n\n9\n00:00:20.195 --> 00:00:21.670\nwe got a fun one for you today.\n\n10\n00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.710\nBecause as a hardware guy,\nthat's what we're gonna get into today.\n\n11\n00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.470\nJoining us in the studios is Don Pezet.\n\n12\n00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.480\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n13\n00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.270\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n14\n00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.664\nReady to do some damage to this server\nsitting here on the desk in between us.\n\n15\n00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:34.310\nIn our last episode, we started\nto introduce server form factors.\n\n16\n00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.180\nSo, we talked about some of the different\nserver types that are out there.\n\n17\n00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.710\nAnd how they vary from desktops and\ntraditional machines.\n\n18\n00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.554\nIn this episode, we're gonna\ntalk about what's on the inside.\n\n19\n00:00:43.554 --> 00:00:45.439\nThe components that make up a server.\n\n20\n00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:47.099\nAnd how those vary from a work station or\n\n21\n00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:50.350\nother type of environment that you\nmight already be familiar with.\n\n22\n00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.590\nNow, some of it actually doesn't\nvary much at all because a computer\n\n23\n00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.310\nis still a computer.\n\n24\n00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.760\nYou got CPU, RAM, hard drives.\n\n25\n00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.810\nThat stuff is all pretty common or just\nubiquitous when it comes to computing.\n\n26\n00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.360\nBut there are still\ndifferences because servers\n\n27\n00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.360\nare used a lot more differently\nthan a work station is.\n\n28\n00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.760\nThink about a work station.\n\n29\n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.830\nIt really only has to do hard work\nwhen you're sitting right in front of\n\n30\n00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.750\nit and using it.\n\n31\n00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.850\nMost of the time, a work station's idling,\nit's wasting resources.\n\n32\n00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.210\nIt's just sitting there doing nothing.\n\n33\n00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.330\nAnd so\nit doesn't need a lot of extra power.\n\n34\n00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.920\nAlso, it's only doing work for one person.\n\n35\n00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.350\nIt only has to make you happy and\nthat's it.\n\n36\n00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.240\nSo as long as it could\nbe optimized enough for\n\n37\n00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.500\none series of task to be performed,\nit's gonna do okay.\n\n38\n00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.990\nA server on the other hand is running\n24 hours a day, 7 days a week,\n\n39\n00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.950\n365 days a year.\n\n40\n00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.860\nMaybe one extra day for\nleap year every now and then.\n\n41\n00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.810\nBut other than that, it is running\nconstantly and never shutting off.\n\n42\n00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.140\nAnd it's not just trying\nto make one person happy.\n\n43\n00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.336\nIt might be trying to make\nthousands of people happy.\n\n44\n00:01:49.336 --> 00:01:51.190\nAnd make them equally happy.\n\n45\n00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.390\nSo, it's gotta be able to\ndo more concurrent things.\n\n46\n00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.620\nStuff at the same time\nthan a workstation does.\n\n47\n00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.780\nSo, it has to be optimized differently.\n\n48\n00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.610\nIt has to be able to handle\nthings a lot more efficiently.\n\n49\n00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.710\nAnd it has to be designed to never rest.\n\n50\n00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.070\nTo never have lulls in activity.\n\n51\n00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.530\nNow, you are going to\nhave lulls in activity.\n\n52\n00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.180\nBut we don't know when they're gonna be.\n\n53\n00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.530\nAnd the manufacturers of the servers,\n\n54\n00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.740\nthey don't know that you're\ngonna have that either.\n\n55\n00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.070\nThey just have to assume you're gonna be\nrunning at 100% utilization all the time.\n\n56\n00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.150\nSo, servers are designed\nwith very high tolerances.\n\n57\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.910\nThat they can handle\ntemperature disparities and\n\n58\n00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.010\nworkloads that are far more\naggressive than a workstation.\n\n59\n00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.180\nAnd not get damaged.\n\n60\n00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.260\nThe components are a much higher quality\nbecause they need them to run longer.\n\n61\n00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.900\nIf the hard drive in my laptop fails,\nwell that annoys the heck out of me.\n\n62\n00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.190\nBut if the hard drive\nin this server fails,\n\n63\n00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.840\nthat could annoy thousands of people,\nright?\n\n64\n00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.040\nSo everything in a server is designed\nwith a higher quality in mind.\n\n65\n00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.260\nA higher MTBF,\nmean time between failure that\n\n66\n00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.530\na normal desktop hard drive can\nonly have a one year warranty.\n\n67\n00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.040\nBut a server hard drive\nhave a three year warranty.\n\n68\n00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.220\nBecause they expect it to be able to\nrun for three years without fail.\n\n69\n00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.069\nSame thing with all the components inside\nof servers, three year warranties.\n\n70\n00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.409\nEven five year warranties are pretty\ncommon when it comes to servers.\n\n71\n00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:06.735\nSo that will be the biggest difference.\n\n72\n00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:08.720\nWe take the support and\nlook at what is inside of it.\n\n73\n00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.050\nIs that we're gonna notice a higher\nquality a better standard of worksmanship.\n\n74\n00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.430\nAnd I'm using an HPE server here.\n\n75\n00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.061\nBut this could be a Dell server or\na Lenovo sever, it's all the same.\n\n76\n00:03:20.061 --> 00:03:21.830\nThere are white box servers out there.\n\n77\n00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.060\nServers that don't have a brand\nlike that attached to them.\n\n78\n00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.240\nYou know, I could go and\nput third-party components together and\n\n79\n00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.389\nstart making servers.\n\n80\n00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:30.451\nThey're gonna be lower quality.\n\n81\n00:03:30.451 --> 00:03:31.708\nThey're gonna be cheaper.\n\n82\n00:03:31.708 --> 00:03:34.340\nBut they're not gonna go\nas long without failure.\n\n83\n00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.200\nThey're not gonna have the research and\nscience put behind them.\n\n84\n00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.830\nTo make sure they can handle temperatures\nproperly and workloads properly.\n\n85\n00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.920\nSo when you pay that extra money\nto get a name brand server,\n\n86\n00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.220\nthere's a reason for it.\n\n87\n00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.270\nThere is a lot of R&amp;D that goes\ninto creating one of these things.\n\n88\n00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.540\nAnd you'll see it as we look around.\n\n89\n00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.000\nThe way the component is designed and\nthe amount of thought that goes into it.\n\n90\n00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.630\nSo let's start with\nsomething kind of important.\n\n91\n00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.260\nGetting into the server\nin the first place.\n\n92\n00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.010\nGetting into a server can actually\nbe kinda challenging sometimes.\n\n93\n00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.824\nSome vendors like Dell,\ntries to make their servers tool less.\n\n94\n00:04:04.824 --> 00:04:07.960\nWhere you can get into them and work\non them without having to use the tool.\n\n95\n00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.780\nOther vendors like HPE,\n\n96\n00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.670\nthey know that people don't really\ngo into servers very often.\n\n97\n00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.810\nSo they don't worry about that.\n\n98\n00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.140\nThey required a tool.\n\n99\n00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.310\nBut they actually go the extra step to\ninclude the tool mounted on the back of\n\n100\n00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.950\nthe server.\n\n101\n00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.920\nSo there's different vendors\nthat have different approaches.\n\n102\n00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.830\nYou'll need to read the manual for yours.\n\n103\n00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.010\nBut on this particular one,\nit doesn't have a lock on it.\n\n104\n00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.580\nInstead, it's got a screw.\n\n105\n00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.290\nSo if we were to look at\nthe surface of this server,\n\n106\n00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.750\nwhat you'll see is a little\nscrew way up here.\n\n107\n00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.240\nAnd it's imprinted in the board.\n\n108\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.200\nIt's actually hard for me to see, so\nI know it's not showing up on camera.\n\n109\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.650\nBut it says, hood lock screw.\n\n110\n00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.908\nSo I'm not gonna be able to open up\nthis server unless I remove that screw.\n\n111\n00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:45.606\nI guess you sorta can see it on camera.\n\n112\n00:04:45.606 --> 00:04:47.870\nBut it's this hood lock screw, so\nI'm gonna need to remove that.\n\n113\n00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.570\nAnd looking at it,\nit looks like it's a T8 or\n\n114\n00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.910\na T10, one of those little star,\nwhat are those called?\n\n115\n00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.410\n&gt;&gt; The hex keys or the star keys?\n\n116\n00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.141\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the stars, not hex,\nbut it's like a T8 or a T10.\n\n117\n00:05:00.141 --> 00:05:01.048\n&gt;&gt; Torque screws.\n\n118\n00:05:01.048 --> 00:05:01.920\n&gt;&gt; Torques.\nYep, that is it.\n\n119\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.394\nYep, so it's a little torque screw\nthat I need to get this thing open.\n\n120\n00:05:04.394 --> 00:05:07.620\nAnd then, I'll be able to pop this\npanel off and get inside of the server.\n\n121\n00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.299\nWell, they've actually stuck a little\ntorques wrench on the back of this\n\n122\n00:05:12.299 --> 00:05:14.265\nserver that I can just pop out.\n\n123\n00:05:14.265 --> 00:05:18.787\nSo, I don't need even have to break out my\ntrustee toolkit, well if I can get it out,\n\n124\n00:05:18.787 --> 00:05:19.730\nthere go.\n\n125\n00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.001\nSo, it's got this little key that\nI can use to open up the server.\n\n126\n00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:25.130\nNot every vendor does that.\n\n127\n00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.625\nSometimes you need to have a toolkit.\n\n128\n00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:29.724\nI usually keep a handy\none around like this one,\n\n129\n00:05:29.724 --> 00:05:32.330\nwhich is from a company called iFixit.\n\n130\n00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.097\nBut they just make tools.\n\n131\n00:05:35.097 --> 00:05:37.290\nYou never know what you're gonna need\nwhen you start working on servers.\n\n132\n00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.370\nSo having a range of bits, and stuff,\n\n133\n00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.220\nis gonna help you with\nbeing able to get in there.\n\n134\n00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.690\nAnd make sure you can access\nthe components and work with it.\n\n135\n00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.099\nSo I can use the key that this came with.\n\n136\n00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:48.250\nOr I can use my own\nlittle screw driver here.\n\n137\n00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.660\nWhatever works to get inside of it.\n\n138\n00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.560\nYou do wanna follow the same precautions,\nyou follow when working on a work station.\n\n139\n00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.690\nSo for example we have ESD,\nElectro Static Discharge.\n\n140\n00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.720\nThat the human body builds\nup static electricity and\n\n141\n00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.250\nwhen you touch metal components,\nwhere does that electrical charge go?\n\n142\n00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.250\nInto the components.\n\n143\n00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.320\nAnd it does not take much of\na charge at all to damage memory.\n\n144\n00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.266\nWes actually teases me a lot\ncuz I'll do these shows and\n\n145\n00:06:13.266 --> 00:06:15.070\nI won't wear any NSD wristband.\n\n146\n00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.169\nAnd he asked me about it one day.\n\n147\n00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.490\nHe said, Don,\nyou've worked in computers a long time.\n\n148\n00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.270\nYou should know better.\n\n149\n00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.400\nWhy don't you wear a wristband?\n\n150\n00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.470\nAnd I told Wes, I said.\n\n151\n00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.870\nI do this sad thing which is,\nI calculate the dollars in my head.\n\n152\n00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.260\nHow expensive is this equipment?\n\n153\n00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.950\nAnd if it's expensive enough,\nI go and put my ESD band on.\n\n154\n00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.080\nBut if it's cheap equipment,\nI don't worry about it.\n\n155\n00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.400\nI really should be wearing one right now.\n\n156\n00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.030\nBut, I got in the habit, when I started.\n\n157\n00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.100\nI used to do HP and, before that,\nCompaq warranty support.\n\n158\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.980\nAnd, I would go out and work on these\nProliance 7000s, Proliance 8000s.\n\n159\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.320\nThey're these giant memory\nboards that you'd slide out.\n\n160\n00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.015\nAnd the memory boards,\nwhen they were populated, they were 15,\n\n161\n00:06:54.015 --> 00:06:55.410\n$20,000 just in memory.\n\n162\n00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.600\nAnd so\nwhen you're holding that much memory,\n\n163\n00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.952\nthat can easily be zapped\nwith a simple charge.\n\n164\n00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:03.740\nYou wanna make sure you're\nhandling your EST properly.\n\n165\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.580\nOn cheaper equipment or equipment that\nis under warranty [LAUGH] or whatever.\n\n166\n00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.370\nYou can hold your hand to a metal service\nand you know that you're grounded.\n\n167\n00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.510\nThat's when you sub server.\n\n168\n00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.974\nBut any SD wristband.\n\n169\n00:07:13.974 --> 00:07:17.062\nIt is really something that you wanna make\nsure that you got in your possession.\n\n170\n00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:18.942\nAnd I believe I actually\nhave one right here.\n\n171\n00:07:18.942 --> 00:07:20.958\nSo, I'm being truly lazy and\nnot wearing it.\n\n172\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.200\nSo, I'll follow the official standard.\n\n173\n00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.380\nI'll wear my ESD wristband.\n\n174\n00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.361\n&gt;&gt; While you're opening that up.\n\n175\n00:07:27.361 --> 00:07:28.904\nWhat I think is funny about that Don.\n\n176\n00:07:28.904 --> 00:07:30.632\nAs much computer stuff\nas we do around here,\n\n177\n00:07:30.632 --> 00:07:33.213\nI think that's the first time\nthat bag's actually been opened.\n\n178\n00:07:33.213 --> 00:07:35.253\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a brand new\n\n179\n00:07:35.253 --> 00:07:36.106\nwrist\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n180\n00:07:36.106 --> 00:07:38.977\n&gt;&gt; Well, when I used to do warranty repair\n\n181\n00:07:38.977 --> 00:07:42.635\nlike this for a living,\nI had on my desk an ESD mat.\n\n182\n00:07:42.635 --> 00:07:46.302\nAnd it was a work mat that laid on\ntop of the desk, and it was grounded.\n\n183\n00:07:46.302 --> 00:07:48.668\nAnd it was really nice cuz if you\nlaid equipment on top of that mat,\n\n184\n00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:49.590\nit was grounded.\n\n185\n00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.978\nAnd it had a little button snap on it.\n\n186\n00:07:52.978 --> 00:07:55.974\nWhere could attach your ESD\nwristband right to the mat.\n\n187\n00:07:55.974 --> 00:07:58.456\nAnd that was a pretty\nconvenient thing to have.\n\n188\n00:07:58.456 --> 00:08:03.221\nBut I'm just putting on my wristband here,\nkinda trying to Tighten it up here.\n\n189\n00:08:03.221 --> 00:08:06.586\nI've got a little tiny\nchild-like wrists here, so\n\n190\n00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:09.500\nit's gonna take just a minute for\nme to that.\n\n191\n00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.780\nBut basically you just want to snug it up,\non your wrist so\n\n192\n00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.320\nthe little metal plate is\ntouching your wrist, and then for\n\n193\n00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.164\nthere on the other end of the chord cable,\nyou have an alligator clip.\n\n194\n00:08:19.164 --> 00:08:20.630\nAnd on a server.\n\n195\n00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.060\nThe casing, it's almost entirely metal.\n\n196\n00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.390\nUsually they are and\n\n197\n00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.130\nit's entirely grounded cuz\nthe server is using as a ground 2.\n\n198\n00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.230\nSo, if you attach this to\nthe metal of the server,\n\n199\n00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.610\nthat's gonna work out really handy.\n\n200\n00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.760\nNow, the problem you'll have with most\nservers, is before you open the lead,\n\n201\n00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.900\nit's hard to tell what parts are coming\noff, and what's parts are staying on.\n\n202\n00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.490\nSo, I usually wait to attach the SD band\nuntil I actually have the lead opened,\n\n203\n00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:42.760\ncuz then I can figure\nout where to attach it.\n\n204\n00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.460\nSo I'll do that here.\n\n205\n00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.880\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nget this thing open.\n\n206\n00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.390\nI'll reach out here and\nundo this foot lock screw.\n\n207\n00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.120\nAnd we get that undone.\n\n208\n00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.410\nAnd this screw is really small, so\n\n209\n00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:59.110\nthe key thing here is to not lose it,\nwhich I've done before.\n\n210\n00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.000\nYou can replace them but it's kind\nof hard to find these torque screws.\n\n211\n00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.410\nThey don't just have them at\nyour normal hardware store.\n\n212\n00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:09.130\nAnd if we can get this thing out,\nthen I'll be able to pop the case off.\n\n213\n00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:13.200\nNow, you can work on a server\nwhile it's in the rack.\n\n214\n00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.570\nYou can slide these things out and work on\nit, but if you're gonna stand on a ladder\n\n215\n00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.990\nand all that, that's just a little\ntoo dangerous in my opinion.\n\n216\n00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:24.060\nSo, preferably, you take it to a bench\nlike this and then you can work on it.\n\n217\n00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.890\nOnce that screw's out,\nI just need to slide this plate back in.\n\n218\n00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.710\nI've got a push button here\nthat releases a lever, and\n\n219\n00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.090\nlets us slide the whole thing back in.\n\n220\n00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.220\nMy lovely assistant, Wes,\nis gonna help me slide that back.\n\n221\n00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.070\nThere we go.\nAnd now we'll be able to pop that\n\n222\n00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.770\ncover right off, and\npopping that cover up,\n\n223\n00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.550\nbecause it's a full cover, I really\ncouldn't do that while it was in the rack,\n\n224\n00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.880\nunless I slid it all the way out to\nexpose the back side, and pop that off.\n\n225\n00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.690\nNow, before you just take this and\nset it aside,\n\n226\n00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.850\nwhich is my normal habit,\ntake a look on the inside.\n\n227\n00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.230\nBecause on servers, let me tell you,\nthey do something really cool.\n\n228\n00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:03.880\nHey, if we can get this on camera\na lot of venders: Dell and\n\n229\n00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.590\nHP definitely, Lenovo does too.\n\n230\n00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:11.130\nThey put a nice little chart\nright inside of the case,\n\n231\n00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.310\nthat helps you identify\nwhat components are.\n\n232\n00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.520\nHere's a picture of the motherboard, and\n\n233\n00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.320\nit's got numbers that identify\nwhat all of these components are.\n\n234\n00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.130\nSo, I can find things easily.\n\n235\n00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.840\nIt also shows the ports on\nthe back of the server.\n\n236\n00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.070\nAs well as the cabling running throughout.\n\n237\n00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.980\nHere's the power supplies and it shows\npower cables running up to the hard\n\n238\n00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.960\ndrives, the back plane, the motherboard.\n\n239\n00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.270\nAnd it shows how that's routed.\n\n240\n00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.150\nAnd that's important because\nas we work on the server,\n\n241\n00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.550\nif we take a piece out, we might move\nthose wires to get them out of the way.\n\n242\n00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:43.160\nAnd the wires are expected to\nbe in a very specific position.\n\n243\n00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.680\nWe're gonna talk about air\nflow a little bit later.\n\n244\n00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.310\nAirflow inside of a server\nis super important.\n\n245\n00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:52.000\nAnd if you run these wires in the wrong\nspot they can obstruct airflow.\n\n246\n00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.120\nSo, we need to have that information\nhandy, and they're showing us that.\n\n247\n00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.480\nNow, one of the most valuable\nthings on this card, is right here.\n\n248\n00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.210\nThe DIMM configuration.\n\n249\n00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.490\nThis is for memory.\n\n250\n00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:05.690\nWhen you start looking at memory slots,\nhow some servers or workstations.\n\n251\n00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.540\nYou have to do memory in pairs.\n\n252\n00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:08.540\nOr sometimes it doesn't matter.\n\n253\n00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.350\nYou don't have to do them in pairs.\n\n254\n00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.550\nYou can do whatever you want.\n\n255\n00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:14.710\nSometimes, there's slot number one\nthat has to be populated first.\n\n256\n00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.510\nOr slot number one and three.\n\n257\n00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.135\nYou have to skip two and all that.\n\n258\n00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:19.745\nIt's kind of a mystery.\n\n259\n00:11:19.745 --> 00:11:21.585\nWell, as we look at this,\n\n260\n00:11:21.585 --> 00:11:24.675\nyou'll see it right here where\nit's telling me what I need to do.\n\n261\n00:11:24.675 --> 00:11:28.405\nGiving me the instructions that on this\nserver, here's how we populate this.\n\n262\n00:11:28.405 --> 00:11:31.215\nAnd it's showing me\nthe pairs right down here.\n\n263\n00:11:31.215 --> 00:11:34.275\nThe channel, channel 1, channel 2,\nchannel 3, so I can make sure\n\n264\n00:11:34.275 --> 00:11:38.500\nthat I get the optimal memory\nconfiguration possible on this system.\n\n265\n00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.730\nSo, that's really valuable, and they\nstick it right on the inside of the lid.\n\n266\n00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.120\nSo, when you first crack\nopen a new server,\n\n267\n00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.950\nif you need to go inside it,\nlook under the lid.\n\n268\n00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.760\nA lot of times you'll find\ngreat information here, and\n\n269\n00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.420\nyou don't have to go and\nlook it up online, and\n\n270\n00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.590\ngo through all that extra effort.\n\n271\n00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:56.920\nAll right, now we'll set that aside and\nget that out of the way.\n\n272\n00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.670\nAll right, once that's done,\nwe're into the server.\n\n273\n00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:04.520\nAnd when you look in the server, some of\nthe components might look really familiar,\n\n274\n00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.780\nsome might not.\n\n275\n00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.920\nSome things might look alien from\nyour experience with a desktop.\n\n276\n00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.600\nIf you worked with other servers, then\nyou'll recognize stuff that's in here,\n\n277\n00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.300\na lot of it's pretty typical.\n\n278\n00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.920\nThe big challenge when\nyou're inside of a server,\n\n279\n00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.140\nis that they don't follow\nstandards anymore.\n\n280\n00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.100\nIn a desktop, what do we have?\n\n281\n00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.790\nAnd ATX, mini ATX boards,\nwhat are some other ones Les?\n\n282\n00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.130\n&gt;&gt; Micro ATX, it's really all gone to ATX.\n\n283\n00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.220\n&gt;&gt; And ITX, ITX that's the other one.\n\n284\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.270\n&gt;&gt; So when you open up a computer,\nyou kind of expect to see that layout.\n\n285\n00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.250\nWell in servers, they don't do that.\n\n286\n00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.470\nServers are proprietary.\n\n287\n00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.220\nThere's not a standard, there are some\nstandard mother boards out there, but\n\n288\n00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.070\nnobody follows them.\n\n289\n00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:41.430\nDell makes their own mother boards.\n\n290\n00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.140\nHPE makes their own mother boards.\n\n291\n00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.650\nLenovo makes their own mother boards.\n\n292\n00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.670\nAnd they can make them however they want.\n\n293\n00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:50.100\nSo, memory doesn't have to\npoint in a certain direction.\n\n294\n00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.690\nMemory doesn't have to be close to\nthe CPU, although it almost always is.\n\n295\n00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.200\nBut it could be further away.\n\n296\n00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.140\nThe PCI slots don't have\nto be a certain color.\n\n297\n00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.840\nThey don't have to be\narranged a certain direction.\n\n298\n00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.620\nThey can do whatever the heck they want,\nand they do.\n\n299\n00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.570\nCause they're working with super\nsmall space constraints here.\n\n300\n00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.170\nSo, they're gonna move things around.\n\n301\n00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.840\n&gt;&gt; One of the things that you had\nmentioned Don in a previous episode,\n\n302\n00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.180\nyou talked about air flow on this.\n\n303\n00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.990\nSo, I can only imagine that\nwith these rack mount servers,\n\n304\n00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.900\nregardless of it's HPE or if it's Dell,\nthat's there gonna be a certain air flow.\n\n305\n00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.660\nCan you tell us now that\nwe've got the case off,\n\n306\n00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.500\nhow that air flow works in\nrelation to this chassis here?\n\n307\n00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.010\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n308\n00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.970\nSo, before I start sticking my finger in\nyour ear too much I am gonna go ahead and\n\n309\n00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:27.920\nattach my ESD band.\n\n310\n00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.160\nNow, that I've got the lid off,\nI can see some good places to connect it.\n\n311\n00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.460\nUsually when the lid comes off,\n\n312\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.470\nyou'll see notches along the side\nwhere the lid was held on.\n\n313\n00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:39.440\nAnd those are great places to reach in\nwith an alligator clip and snap on.\n\n314\n00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.560\nSo, I'm just gonna get that hook\nover right there, there we go.\n\n315\n00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.515\nSo, now I'm nice and grounded,\nI can say I did my due diligence for once.\n\n316\n00:13:46.515 --> 00:13:50.988\n[COUGH] Now, that I'm in though, taking\na look at this sort of was mentioned\n\n317\n00:13:50.988 --> 00:13:55.961\nair flow, looking at it, I see memory,\nI see processor, I see a few other things.\n\n318\n00:13:55.961 --> 00:13:59.269\nAnd what's not showing up on camera,\nlet me get a light to reflect on this.\n\n319\n00:13:59.269 --> 00:14:04.040\nIf I hold it up, and catch the studio\nlighting just right, there we go.\n\n320\n00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.660\nThere's a plastic sheet right across\nthe top of that motherboard, all right.\n\n321\n00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.440\nWhat that is,\nis what's called an air baffle.\n\n322\n00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.890\nThere's a few different names,\nI usually call it an air shroud,\n\n323\n00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.580\nthe official name is an air baffle.\n\n324\n00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.830\nI can just pop that right off,\nthere it is, so\n\n325\n00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.340\nthere's the air baffle, and\nit's shaped kind of interesting.\n\n326\n00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.850\nSee how it cuts in on the side there,\nand it cuts in up here and\n\n327\n00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:30.760\nit's actually got legs on it,\nthat are about maybe an inch tall,\n\n328\n00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.560\nand what it's doing is channeling airflow.\n\n329\n00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.630\nThat's its sole purpose,\nthat's what this does.\n\n330\n00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:37.890\nIf I took this and\nchucked it in the trash, and\n\n331\n00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:39.650\nran the server like this,\nthe server would run.\n\n332\n00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:40.590\nThe processor would work,\n\n333\n00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:44.750\nthe memory would work, it just wouldn't\nhandle airflow as efficiently.\n\n334\n00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.900\nI said in the last episode that servers\nmove air from the front, to the back.\n\n335\n00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.580\nAnd so, everything is designed that way.\n\n336\n00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:57.130\nIt's designed where the hottest\ncomponents are up at the very front,\n\n337\n00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.580\nleading all the way to the cooler\ncomponents at the back.\n\n338\n00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.690\nThat way the hottest components\nare getting nice, cool air right,\n\n339\n00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:03.700\noff the back.\n\n340\n00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.490\nAnd on this system it doesn't have SSDs.\n\n341\n00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:10.060\nIt's got traditional spinning disks,\nand spinning hard drives,\n\n342\n00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.860\nthe really fast ones,\ngenerate a good bit of heat.\n\n343\n00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.510\nSo, on this server\nlooking across the front,\n\n344\n00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.780\nI've got my hard drives\nall the way up there.\n\n345\n00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.790\nNow, that's not the only reason for\nhaving the hard drives up front.\n\n346\n00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.650\nThe other reason is, a lot of times\nhard drives are hot swappable.\n\n347\n00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.550\nAnd if they're hot swappable, that means I\ncan remove them while the server's powered\n\n348\n00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.050\non, which means I need to\nbe able to get to them.\n\n349\n00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:32.900\nWell, when a server is in a rack and\nit's powered on, what can you get to?\n\n350\n00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.940\nYou can get to the front, and\nyou can get to the back, and that's it.\n\n351\n00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.340\nSo, anything hot swappable has\nto be exposed on those end.\n\n352\n00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.308\nSo, those hard drives have\nto be up towards the front.\n\n353\n00:15:40.308 --> 00:15:44.010\nAnd other hot-swappable components\nlike the hot-swappable power supplies\n\n354\n00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:46.650\nto the back, so\nyou can get at them while it's in a rack.\n\n355\n00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:51.480\nSo, that's another reason why we\nhave these located where they are.\n\n356\n00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.516\nEverything else kind of\ngets lobbed in the middle.\n\n357\n00:15:53.516 --> 00:15:57.421\nSo, this server is gonna be sucking air\nin from the front, and the hard drives\n\n358\n00:15:57.421 --> 00:16:00.981\nup here have little vents on the front\nof them, so that air can come in.\n\n359\n00:16:00.981 --> 00:16:03.575\nThe air is being drawn in by fans, and\n\n360\n00:16:03.575 --> 00:16:08.610\nI've got a bank of eight fans right\nhere and another two fans over here.\n\n361\n00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:15.280\nThese fans are dropped in here and\njust held in place by little rubber,\n\n362\n00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.240\nI wanna say grommets, but\nthey're screws, I don't know.\n\n363\n00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.130\nThey're kind of like fake rubber screws.\n\n364\n00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:27.430\nAnd you can pop them out,\nbecause they're designed to come in and\n\n365\n00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.370\nout in case you have to replace them.\n\n366\n00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:33.200\nBecause the fans,\nthey are a moving part inside the server.\n\n367\n00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.370\nAnd moving parts do tend to\nwear out over time and break.\n\n368\n00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.900\nAnd so,\non these fans it will happen eventually,\n\n369\n00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.760\nthat they'll die out and\nI have to replace them.\n\n370\n00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:49.430\nSo if I can get this connector off,\nI can take this one out and show you.\n\n371\n00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:53.410\nBut, basically, these fans,\nwhen you look at one of these,\n\n372\n00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.790\nit's really two fans stuck together.\n\n373\n00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.935\nSo I've got, trying to see if I\ncan hold this in some way where\n\n374\n00:16:59.935 --> 00:17:03.712\nwe can actually get, you know,\nit's black on black here, there we go.\n\n375\n00:17:03.712 --> 00:17:08.350\nSo can see the fan's right here,\nit's two fans stuck together.\n\n376\n00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:11.990\nAnd what's happening is it's drawing\nair in and it's blowing air out.\n\n377\n00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.720\nSo the two fans kinda work as a team\n\n378\n00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.520\nto move data through here as quick as\npossible and as efficiently as possible.\n\n379\n00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.520\nSo that's the way these fans work.\n\n380\n00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:27.260\nAnd not just one fan, but here's two,\nand then I've got four, six, eight, ten.\n\n381\n00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.530\nI've got ten fans lined up right here.\n\n382\n00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:34.350\nAll sucking air from the front and\ntaking it towards the back.\n\n383\n00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.630\nAll right, now,\nif you look a little closer,\n\n384\n00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.740\nyou'll see where I've got this wire\ntray right here, all these wires.\n\n385\n00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.530\nWell, these fans are drawing\nair right here, and\n\n386\n00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:48.850\nover towards this side,\nI've got power cables coming through.\n\n387\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:53.850\nAnd the power cables are coming right\nhere through the metal chassis.\n\n388\n00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.340\nSo there's a big hole in\nthe metal chassis right here.\n\n389\n00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:01.670\nIf that was exposed,\nthis fan will be drawing in air, and\n\n390\n00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.200\nit could potentially draw in\nair from the back of the case.\n\n391\n00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.770\nSee, air could kind of form a loop.\n\n392\n00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.230\nAnd so the designers,\nthey think about this stuff.\n\n393\n00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:15.740\nAnd there's actually little foam stoppers\nright here wrapped around the cable.\n\n394\n00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.010\nAnd what those form stoppers do,\nis they wrap around the cable and\n\n395\n00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:21.420\nthey stop the air flow, they channel it so\nthe air flow is going forward.\n\n396\n00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:28.010\nSo now this fan is always drawing air\nfrom the hard drives back and bringing\n\n397\n00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:31.180\nit back in, and making sure that it\ncomes back towards the back of the unit.\n\n398\n00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.780\nNow, you might notice I'm covering\na hard drive here with my hand.\n\n399\n00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.200\nWhat about this hard drive?\n\n400\n00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.260\nIf we're closing this off,\nthis hard drive's gotta get some air.\n\n401\n00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.310\nIt doesn't have any fans.\n\n402\n00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.600\nThere's no fans here.\n\n403\n00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.580\nWell, if you just go back a little bit\nfurther, here's the power supply, and\n\n404\n00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.760\nthe power supply is two\nmore fans on the front.\n\n405\n00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:53.590\nAnd these fans are pulling with such\nforce that they pull air from the front\n\n406\n00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.500\nright through the back,\nright through the power supply.\n\n407\n00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.080\nSo that's it's own separate air channel.\n\n408\n00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.080\nExcept for this big gap here where all\nthe power cables have to run through.\n\n409\n00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.549\nAnd that's where the plastic\nshroud comes in.\n\n410\n00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:11.032\nThe plastic shroud snaps over all this,\nand once it's in place,\n\n411\n00:19:11.032 --> 00:19:16.738\nit's making sure that the power supply's\nairflow stays all in the power supply and\n\n412\n00:19:16.738 --> 00:19:21.010\nthat these fans are blowing\nacross the CPU and the memory.\n\n413\n00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:25.510\nThat air is being channeled right\nacross that equipment and being vented.\n\n414\n00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:29.430\nIt actually closes down towards the end\n\n415\n00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.770\nwhere it's blowing across some\nof these rear components.\n\n416\n00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:35.930\nWe've got the chip set and\nthe RAID controller.\n\n417\n00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.220\nThose components don't\nget too terribly hot, but\n\n418\n00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:41.840\nthe chip set gets hard enough to need\na heat sink, not a fan, but a heat sink.\n\n419\n00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.150\nAnd the RAID controller,\nit doesn't have a fan or a heat sync.\n\n420\n00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.410\nSo, it's just the remnants of that air,\nand\n\n421\n00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.505\nthat air is usually warmer by\nthe time it gets to this point.\n\n422\n00:19:49.505 --> 00:19:52.920\nCuz it got warmed up by the hard drives,\nwarmed up by the CPU and\n\n423\n00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.570\nthe RAM and now it reaches here.\n\n424\n00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.690\nIt's kind of at it's warmest\nstate before exiting the back.\n\n425\n00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.110\nAnd the back of the server rack\nis entirely perforated and\n\n426\n00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.750\nthat's where that air is going\nto be pushed out, the back side.\n\n427\n00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:08.059\nOkay, now, on this particular server,\nyou'll notice this big open area over here\n\n428\n00:20:08.059 --> 00:20:11.759\nand it looks like that's where\nthe redundant power supply would go, but\n\n429\n00:20:11.759 --> 00:20:14.508\nthis one actually uses\nreally small power supplies.\n\n430\n00:20:14.508 --> 00:20:19.051\nAnd so,\nthis block contains two power supplies.\n\n431\n00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:23.670\nAnd so, I've got redundant\npower supplies right here.\n\n432\n00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.890\nThis empty area is to\nallow another PCI card.\n\n433\n00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:30.120\nAnd that PCI card might generate\nsome heat depending on what it is.\n\n434\n00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.660\nLike if it's a graphics card or\n\n435\n00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:36.230\nsomething like that, usually it's an\nencryption card, like an SSL offload card.\n\n436\n00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:40.010\nSo it's got its own fans that blow\nair that would be cooling that\n\n437\n00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.870\ncard if it was here.\n\n438\n00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:43.770\nMine's empty, so\nit's just blowing that air right out.\n\n439\n00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.990\nSo that doesn't necessarily\nhelp anything but\n\n440\n00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.140\nit's there in case I add\na PCI card in that slot.\n\n441\n00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:52.236\n&gt;&gt; And do these two power supplies here,\nDon, do they run in an active passive?\n\n442\n00:20:52.236 --> 00:20:53.730\nAre they active active?\n\n443\n00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:57.000\nHow do the power supplies, if you\nhave more than one, work in a server?\n\n444\n00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.685\n&gt;&gt; So\nit's entirely up to the manufacturers,\n\n445\n00:20:58.685 --> 00:20:59.950\ncuz there's no standard here.\n\n446\n00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.150\nThey're not following standards,\nthey do whatever they want.\n\n447\n00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:04.600\nBut almost all of them go active active.\n\n448\n00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.160\nSo both power supply will run at 50%.\n\n449\n00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.110\nAnd then, if one power supply dies or\nget removed,\n\n450\n00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:14.000\nyou accidentally unplug it, the other just\nramps up to 100% and that's the end of it.\n\n451\n00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.690\nSo that's how most of them run.\n\n452\n00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:19.710\nBut I have seen others where they have\nactive passive, or ones that are spares.\n\n453\n00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.300\nThis one only has two.\n\n454\n00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:23.550\nI've seen servers with four, or\n\n455\n00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.160\neven eight power supplies, especially\nwhen you get into blade servers,\n\n456\n00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.850\nbecause you've got power supplies that\nare being shared across all the blades.\n\n457\n00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:31.480\nAnd so,\nthey'll have eight power supplies in them\n\n458\n00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.570\nbecause they're trying to handle\nall those different blades.\n\n459\n00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.640\nSo two is pretty common for a one new\nserver, these compact ones are more and\n\n460\n00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.029\nmore popular these days,\nnice and small form factor, but\n\n461\n00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:42.490\nthere are some still have\nthe larger power supplies, too.\n\n462\n00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.570\nAll right, so\nas far as general air flow and\n\n463\n00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:51.300\nthe arrangement of the components,\nwhat I'm trying to stress here is,\n\n464\n00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.324\nthey don't pick where things go\nbased on a standard like ATX.\n\n465\n00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.500\nThey pick where things go based\non air flow and temperature, and\n\n466\n00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.080\ngetting everything to fit in\nthe smallest amount of space possible.\n\n467\n00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.032\nWe're not talking laptop space,\nbut we're talking about a pretty\n\n468\n00:22:06.032 --> 00:22:08.992\nsmall amount of space that they've\ngotta use pretty efficiently.\n\n469\n00:22:10.151 --> 00:22:13.340\nAll right, so let's talk about each\nof the components individually.\n\n470\n00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.850\nI know we're running a little low on time,\nso we'll maybe talk about CPUs right now,\n\n471\n00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.860\nand then we'll get into the other\ncomponents in part two.\n\n472\n00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.230\nBut when I look around inside of this\ncase, I move some and mess around,\n\n473\n00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.760\none of the things you probably notice\nwas this giant heat sink over here.\n\n474\n00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.540\nThat's our CPU.\n\n475\n00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:34.750\nIf I can see under this heat sink,\nthe processor is right under there and\n\n476\n00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:37.676\nit's just held in a couple\nof torque screws there.\n\n477\n00:22:37.676 --> 00:22:40.139\nWhat did I do with that little Allen key?\n\n478\n00:22:40.139 --> 00:22:41.170\nHere it is.\n\n479\n00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.970\nSo we could probably take that out and\nget a look at it.\n\n480\n00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:47.610\nThis server only has one CPU.\n\n481\n00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:53.930\nA lot of servers these days come with two,\nor one populated and one empty.\n\n482\n00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.830\nSo you might have bought\nit with only one CPU, but\n\n483\n00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:59.590\nyou've got the option to add\na second CPU later if you want to.\n\n484\n00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:04.240\nNow, most of these are gonna be screwed\ninto the motherboard, because servers\n\n485\n00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.120\nvibrate when they run, especially when you\nhave a bunch of them stacked together.\n\n486\n00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.670\nSo it is possible for\nyou to have chip creep,\n\n487\n00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:14.920\nwhere the devices will slowly\nwork themselves out of the slots.\n\n488\n00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.000\nThe memory sticks have little plastic arms\non them that snap in place to make sure\n\n489\n00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.220\nthat doesn't happen.\n\n490\n00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.670\nThe CPU's, they don't have that.\n\n491\n00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.910\nAnd so, there's usually at\nleast two big screws on there.\n\n492\n00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:30.520\nA lot of other vendors have actually\nswitched from using traditional socket\n\n493\n00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.670\nprocessors, it's using card processors,\nlike cards that pop in.\n\n494\n00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:36.380\nEven on some of the bigger HPE systems.\n\n495\n00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:40.440\nWhen there's only one or two CPU, it's\nalmost always a socket, but when there's\n\n496\n00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.900\nfour, eight CPUs that are usually switched\nto the cards, and you'll drop those in.\n\n497\n00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.314\nAnd, again, that's to make sure that we\ndon't have chip creep in a lot of that.\n\n498\n00:23:47.314 --> 00:23:52.330\nBut you can see the CPU there just\nlike we would see on a work station or\n\n499\n00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:53.480\neven a laptop.\n\n500\n00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.948\nThis one is removable.\n\n501\n00:23:54.948 --> 00:23:58.095\nA lot of servers use\nthe higher end Intel cards.\n\n502\n00:23:58.095 --> 00:24:00.929\nAnd it's not cost efficient for\nthem to modify them.\n\n503\n00:24:00.929 --> 00:24:02.186\nSo they're socket-based.\n\n504\n00:24:02.186 --> 00:24:04.820\nYou may never remove this processor.\n\n505\n00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.649\nProcessors rarely fail, so it would\nreally make sense for them to solder\n\n506\n00:24:08.649 --> 00:24:12.757\nit into the board and make it a standard\ncomponent, one less socket, right?\n\n507\n00:24:12.757 --> 00:24:16.430\nBut because of the cost of modifying\nthe higher end chips, they usually don't.\n\n508\n00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:22.480\nAnd so you end up with a processor like\nthis one that we could pop out and\n\n509\n00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.290\nupgrade.\n\n510\n00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:24.950\nI'll say upgrade.\n\n511\n00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:30.870\nIt's really a hassle to upgrade processors\nbecause when you upgrade a processor,\n\n512\n00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:34.120\nI've got this one, I don't actually\nknow what the processor is and\n\n513\n00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.428\nit's covered in the thermal paste.\n\n514\n00:24:38.428 --> 00:24:40.950\nSo I have to wipe all the thermal\npaste off it to look at it and\n\n515\n00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.380\nfind out what it is, and if I had a second\none I have to get the exact same one.\n\n516\n00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.520\nNow, here's where thing gets tricky.\n\n517\n00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:52.256\nLet's say that this is an Intel Xeon and\nit's a 3450 or something like that.\n\n518\n00:24:52.256 --> 00:24:54.100\nSo now, I know the model number.\n\n519\n00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.120\nSo I go out and I go buy another one.\n\n520\n00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:03.210\nWell, if you buy it from HP, if it's an HP\nserver, or if you buy it from Dell or\n\n521\n00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:06.730\nLenovo, they'll ask you for\nthe serial number of your unit.\n\n522\n00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.780\nNow, why do they need to know\nthe serial number of your unit\n\n523\n00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.490\nif you know the processor to buy?\n\n524\n00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.850\nAnd the reason is,\nwhen these processors are manufactured,\n\n525\n00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:16.550\nthey're manufactured\nin these giant plates.\n\n526\n00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.910\nThey'll make a hundred CPUs at\na time in these giant plates.\n\n527\n00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:23.950\nAnd every time they manufacture one\nthere's certain faults that happen, so\n\n528\n00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:25.360\nsome of them go in the trash.\n\n529\n00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.197\nWell, as they correct those fault and\nimprove on the processor,\n\n530\n00:25:28.197 --> 00:25:31.147\nthe model number doesn't change but\nthe design slightly changes.\n\n531\n00:25:31.147 --> 00:25:35.410\nAnd so, they have what they\ncalled steppings and families.\n\n532\n00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.960\nWhen you buy it, there might be one\nmodel number for that processor, but\n\n533\n00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.970\nthere could be ten different families and\n\n534\n00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:46.050\nthree different steppings in each family,\nand there is all these variations.\n\n535\n00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:48.420\nAnd if I'm gonna do\nmultiprocessor systems,\n\n536\n00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:53.320\nright, more than one physical CPU, I've\ngotta make sure all of that stuff matches.\n\n537\n00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.980\nIt can't just be the model number.\n\n538\n00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.020\nI've got to at least get the same family\nand preferably the same stepping or\n\n539\n00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.240\nat least close in order for it to work.\n\n540\n00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.090\nIf I get that stuff wrong,\n\n541\n00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:07.050\nI may drop a second CPU in there that\nappears identical, and it doesn't work.\n\n542\n00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:09.590\nThe system doesn't detect it, and\nyou come up with just one CPU.\n\n543\n00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:12.070\nYou won't hurt anything,\nother than your pocketbook, right?\n\n544\n00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.880\nCuz you're wasting money\nbuying these CPUs.\n\n545\n00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:18.550\nSo, when it comes to upgrading CPUs\nin a server, don't go on eBay.\n\n546\n00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.162\nDon't buy aftermarket.\n\n547\n00:26:20.162 --> 00:26:23.320\nDon't even go to Amazon or whatever.\n\n548\n00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.720\nMake sure you go to the original\nvendor of that equipment.\n\n549\n00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.390\nGo to Dell, HP, Lenovo.\n\n550\n00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:31.300\nBuy it from them, mostly because\nthat's gonna keep your warranty intact\n\n551\n00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.580\nif you're still on a warranty.\n\n552\n00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:36.170\nBut secondly, because you'll ensure that\nyou get the right family and stepping.\n\n553\n00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:40.380\nWhen they manufacture these, they set\nasides batches with each one to make sure\n\n554\n00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.170\nthey've got them available for\nsale for those needs.\n\n555\n00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:47.240\nBut it also means though that if you\nbuy a server with one processor,\n\n556\n00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.160\nwith the intent of\nupgrading it down the road,\n\n557\n00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.950\nand I'll add a second processor later and\nyou wait three years.\n\n558\n00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:55.395\nAnd three years later you call and\nyou say hey, can I buy that processor?\n\n559\n00:26:55.395 --> 00:26:57.355\nThey'll probably tell you no,\nit's not available.\n\n560\n00:26:57.355 --> 00:26:59.165\nSorry, we don't have it anymore, right?\n\n561\n00:26:59.165 --> 00:27:02.765\nSo when you buy a server, it's a good\nidea to buy with the amount of processors\n\n562\n00:27:02.765 --> 00:27:04.965\nthat you intended to have\nright from the very beginning.\n\n563\n00:27:04.965 --> 00:27:08.455\nAnd that's another argument for\nscaling out versus scaling up.\n\n564\n00:27:08.455 --> 00:27:11.404\nIt's easier for me if you add more servers\nand not worry about the processors than it\n\n565\n00:27:11.404 --> 00:27:12.961\nis for me to take one server and\nupgrade it and\n\n566\n00:27:12.961 --> 00:27:15.680\nadd more hardware to it just cuz there's\nso many things that could go wrong.\n\n567\n00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:20.800\nBut the CPU itself is gonna be much\nlike what you see on a workstation.\n\n568\n00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.460\nDifferences that you'll see,\non the Intel side,\n\n569\n00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.390\nyou'll typically see Xeon processors.\n\n570\n00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:27.547\nAnd Xeons, X-E-O-N, Xeon,\n\n571\n00:27:27.547 --> 00:27:33.300\nthey're different than your standard i5,\nor i7, or even the extremes.\n\n572\n00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.510\nWith Xeons they have more L2 cache.\n\n573\n00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:40.470\nThey have more onboard memory to be\nable to use for repeat instructions.\n\n574\n00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:44.480\nRemember servers are optimized for\ndoing the same task over and\n\n575\n00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.610\nover again, workstations aren't.\n\n576\n00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:49.730\nMy workstation at home has\nto be totally confused.\n\n577\n00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:52.780\nBecause when I get home and sit down,\nit has no idea what I'm about to do.\n\n578\n00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:57.050\nMaybe I'm about to work on a text\nfile when I do my show notes, or\n\n579\n00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:58.880\nmaybe I'm about to fire up Vizio and\ndo a diagram.\n\n580\n00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.404\nMaybe I'm about to fire up a video\ngame and shoot some aliens, right?\n\n581\n00:28:01.404 --> 00:28:03.690\nIt doesn't know what I'm gonna do.\n\n582\n00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:08.520\nOn a server though,\nit's gonna run a relational database and\n\n583\n00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.720\ndo queries all day.\n\n584\n00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.810\nIt's gonna launch video\nrendering software and\n\n585\n00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.650\nrender frame after frame\nof a movie all day long.\n\n586\n00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:18.750\nIt's gonna serve up a webpage, and\ndo TLS encryption all day long.\n\n587\n00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:20.920\nServers do the same thing over and\nover and over again.\n\n588\n00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:27.230\nSo they really benefit from any\noptimization to repeat instructions.\n\n589\n00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.683\nAnd the best way to optimize repeat\ninstructions is to cache them in RAM.\n\n590\n00:28:30.683 --> 00:28:33.450\nThat way, we're not having to give the\ninstructions over and over and over again.\n\n591\n00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:37.350\nSo if I've already performed an activity\nand I remember it, I can just go and\n\n592\n00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:39.640\npull it out of memory instead of going and\nreinventing the wheel.\n\n593\n00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.280\nI don't have to do the math again\nif I've already got it in memory.\n\n594\n00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.240\nIt's just like when we\nlearn as human beings,\n\n595\n00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.810\nif you've already got it memorized you\ndon't need to read the book again.\n\n596\n00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:47.930\nYou got it memorized.\n\n597\n00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:53.930\nSo having extra L1, L2, and L3 cache\non a CPU really helps to optimize that.\n\n598\n00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:59.060\nSo server processors,\nthey're still 32-bit, 64-bit, x64, or\n\n599\n00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:04.850\nAMD64 processors,\njust like you'd see in a workstation\n\n600\n00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:08.390\nexcept they have more onboard cache,\nand that makes it more expensive.\n\n601\n00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.020\nThey're heck of a lot more expensive.\n\n602\n00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.760\nYou'll pay $800 a CPU a lot of times for\nthese things if you buy them individually.\n\n603\n00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.640\nAnd the servers are a lot less expensive.\n\n604\n00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.460\nThe different cache types,\nlet's just talk about that briefly.\n\n605\n00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.922\nI don't know if it'll show up on the exam,\nbut\n\n606\n00:29:21.922 --> 00:29:25.963\njust in case they get really nitpicky\non these cache types L1, L2 and L3,\n\n607\n00:29:25.963 --> 00:29:28.450\nthey're really very\nsimilar in what they do.\n\n608\n00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:30.790\nThey're caching instructions.\n\n609\n00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:36.720\nL1 is the fastest and most expensive, so\nyou usually have a small amount of it.\n\n610\n00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:41.640\nAnd then L3 is the slower and less\nexpensive, and L2 is the middle ground.\n\n611\n00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.738\nSo when you have an instruction\nthat you're performing a lot,\n\n612\n00:29:44.738 --> 00:29:46.265\nthat's gonna go in L1 cache.\n\n613\n00:29:46.265 --> 00:29:47.900\nThat's high priority.\n\n614\n00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:52.250\nIf you have an instruction you perform\na decent amount, that'll go into L2 cache.\n\n615\n00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.488\nAnd if you have an instruction\nyou just perform every now and\n\n616\n00:29:54.488 --> 00:29:56.160\nthen, that will go into L3.\n\n617\n00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.114\nAnd if it ages out then\nit comes down entirely.\n\n618\n00:29:58.114 --> 00:29:59.871\nIt might go into RAM or it just goes away,\n\n619\n00:29:59.871 --> 00:30:02.700\nand we reinvent the wheel\nthe next time we run, right?\n\n620\n00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:06.983\nSo speed and cost is the big difference\nbetween them, and then location.\n\n621\n00:30:06.983 --> 00:30:12.900\nL1 cache is typically built\nright into the wafer on the CPU.\n\n622\n00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:17.680\nSo it's right there alongside\nthe transistors inside the actual CPU.\n\n623\n00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.280\nL2 cache may or may not be.\n\n624\n00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.704\nOn a lot of Xeons, the L2 cache is built\nright in, right alongside that L1 cache,\n\n625\n00:30:25.704 --> 00:30:27.109\nright there in the wafer.\n\n626\n00:30:27.109 --> 00:30:31.410\nAnd then,\nL3 cache is usually outside of the wafer.\n\n627\n00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:35.980\nIt's usually on the silicon board\nthat all of this stuff is mounted to.\n\n628\n00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.500\nIf you have a card-based\nprocessor you'll see it.\n\n629\n00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.780\nIf you have one that's like this,\n\n630\n00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.400\nwell, what we see is a little metal\nplating that's around the transistors.\n\n631\n00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.125\nAnd underneath,\nthat is a green silicon card.\n\n632\n00:30:46.125 --> 00:30:50.770\nAnd if I were to lift that out,\nwhich I don't know if I can do, let's see.\n\n633\n00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:51.930\nThere we go.\n\n634\n00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:53.560\nAnd flip it over.\n\n635\n00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:58.890\nOn the back side of it you'll\nsee all these little chips and\n\n636\n00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.380\nbumps and stuff like that.\n\n637\n00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.950\nI have no idea which ones.\n\n638\n00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:07.838\nBut some of those will be the L3\ncache mounted here on the card,\n\n639\n00:31:07.838 --> 00:31:11.632\nversus actually being in\nthe wafer with the CPU.\n\n640\n00:31:11.632 --> 00:31:15.700\nIt's a good difference there,\non where that's gonna be mounted.\n\n641\n00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:20.520\nAnd the further away from\nthe actual transistors,\n\n642\n00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.000\nthe slower it's gonna be, right?\n\n643\n00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.150\nSo L1 achieves part of its speed\njust by being in the right spot.\n\n644\n00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:29.550\nAnd then, see what I did there,\nI'm putting it in wrong.\n\n645\n00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:31.090\nSo when you put a CPU in,\n\n646\n00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.560\nit's kind of important to make\nsure it goes in the right way.\n\n647\n00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.682\nMost of the time they're key.\n\n648\n00:31:34.682 --> 00:31:37.502\nThey have little notches on the side to\nmake sure it goes in the right way and\n\n649\n00:31:37.502 --> 00:31:40.380\nthat's how I knew I was doing it\nwrong cuz it wouldn't drop in.\n\n650\n00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.870\nYou do have to be really careful.\n\n651\n00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:43.300\nThere's pins.\n\n652\n00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.630\nIn this particular socket\nthe pins are on the board and\n\n653\n00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.750\nthere's just little pads on the processor.\n\n654\n00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:52.144\nOn others it's the other way around where\nthe pins are here on the processor and\n\n655\n00:31:52.144 --> 00:31:53.283\nthe pads are on the board.\n\n656\n00:31:53.283 --> 00:31:55.995\nAnd so\nyou can bend a pin when you put this in.\n\n657\n00:31:55.995 --> 00:31:57.175\nAnd you know how you fix that?\n\n658\n00:31:57.175 --> 00:31:58.512\nYou buy a new server.\n\n659\n00:31:58.512 --> 00:32:00.906\nBecause if you bend one of those pins,\nyou've gotta replace the motherboard.\n\n660\n00:32:00.906 --> 00:32:02.318\nIt's not something you can fix.\n\n661\n00:32:02.318 --> 00:32:04.233\nAnd if you have to\nreplace the motherboard,\n\n662\n00:32:04.233 --> 00:32:06.390\nit's usually cheaper to buy a new server.\n\n663\n00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.650\nMaybe you can pawn it off on warranty.\n\n664\n00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:12.105\nBut if they see a bent pin,\nthey're gonna know how it happened.\n\n665\n00:32:12.105 --> 00:32:16.415\n&gt;&gt; Don, while we've got it right here on\nthis CPU, you mentioned socket types,\n\n666\n00:32:16.415 --> 00:32:19.535\nand I don't know if it's the same\nthing in servers as it is in desktops.\n\n667\n00:32:19.535 --> 00:32:23.145\nI know traditionally in your desktops,\nIntel really likes this design.\n\n668\n00:32:23.145 --> 00:32:25.539\nIn fact they've been with it,\nseems like they've been with it for\n\n669\n00:32:25.539 --> 00:32:27.385\na very long time and\nit's called an LGA socket.\n\n670\n00:32:27.385 --> 00:32:32.175\nWhere you said that the pins are actually\nlike a bed of nails inside of the socket\n\n671\n00:32:32.175 --> 00:32:37.110\nitself and I know AMD, for whatever\nreason, they have stayed with PGA.\n\n672\n00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:40.036\nI can't imagine you'd see too many\nof the AMDs in production here.\n\n673\n00:32:40.036 --> 00:32:43.441\nBut PGAs,\nis that consistent with servers as well?\n\n674\n00:32:43.441 --> 00:32:47.866\nThis type for the Intel based and\nthen the LGA, or the PGA, excuse me,\n\n675\n00:32:47.866 --> 00:32:50.425\nthe pin based, for the AMD processors?\n\n676\n00:32:50.425 --> 00:32:52.696\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, see you used the word\nconsistent with servers and\n\n677\n00:32:52.696 --> 00:32:54.715\nthen that's where that\nwhole thing went wrong.\n\n678\n00:32:54.715 --> 00:32:56.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In this case, yes.\n\n679\n00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.240\nIn this case, absolutely.\n\n680\n00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.060\nThis is standard, like what you'd see.\n\n681\n00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.067\nIn the really big servers though,\nthey use those cards that pop in.\n\n682\n00:33:02.067 --> 00:33:02.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n683\n00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.020\nthat's just a completely different thing,\nbecause now the CPU is actually soldered\n\n684\n00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.340\non to a larger board,\na larger silicon board.\n\n685\n00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.070\nSo it pops in that way and\nthat's just different at that point.\n\n686\n00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:16.670\nSo don't count on it\nbeing a particular way.\n\n687\n00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:18.910\nFortunately, it's not something\nwe have to deal with very often.\n\n688\n00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:20.710\nIt's a rarity.\n\n689\n00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.890\nIn fact, I'm trying to think of the last\ntime I took a CPU out of a server, and\n\n690\n00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:25.600\nit was probably over eight years ago.\n\n691\n00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.130\nNot something you do very often.\n\n692\n00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.440\nAnd that was a failed CPU.\n\n693\n00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.870\nThat's not a frequent thing, either.\n\n694\n00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:33.180\nYou don't see failed CPUs very often.\n\n695\n00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:36.570\nBut you can bake them and\nif you bake a processor, it'll die and\n\n696\n00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:37.760\nyou'll have to replace it.\n\n697\n00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.440\n&gt;&gt; Would you call that history\ncycling around on itself?\n\n698\n00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:44.528\nCuz you remember some of the earlier Intel\nPentium 2s were slot-based processors.\n\n699\n00:33:44.528 --> 00:33:46.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They completely disappeared and\n\n700\n00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:48.480\nnow they're like, well, they were good\nenough, let's bring them back and\n\n701\n00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.880\nput them in the production machines.\n\n702\n00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:55.280\n&gt;&gt; Well, what actually caused it to\ncome back were hot swappable CPUs,\n\n703\n00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.000\nwhich was not possible in the past.\n\n704\n00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.520\nBut some servers actually have hot swap,\nyou can add CPUs while the thing is on,\n\n705\n00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.447\nit's amazing, right, it's amazing\ntechnology but it is out there.\n\n706\n00:34:05.447 --> 00:34:09.790\nAnd you can't manipulate a socket\nlike this while the server is on.\n\n707\n00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:12.420\nI mean I'm gonna touch the casing or\n\n708\n00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.100\nwhatever while I'm working on it,\nshort the server out, I'm gonna power off.\n\n709\n00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:19.460\nSo the ones that are hot swappable\nthey're always card based always and\n\n710\n00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:24.575\nthey'll have these, it's not plastic but\nit's this weird like fiber\n\n711\n00:34:24.575 --> 00:34:29.450\npaper-type material that is non-conductive\nthat will be in between each CPU.\n\n712\n00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:31.980\nSo you can swap one out and not have to\nworry about grounding out the system.\n\n713\n00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.510\nAnd you can do it while\nthe system is online.\n\n714\n00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:35.230\nIt's really cool stuff.\n\n715\n00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:38.470\nSo that's another difference\nyou'll see on servers.\n\n716\n00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:39.317\nI know we're out of time, Wes.\n\n717\n00:34:39.317 --> 00:34:41.388\nBut when you look around the servers,\n\n718\n00:34:41.388 --> 00:34:44.570\nsometimes you'll notice really\nweird colors on things.\n\n719\n00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:47.040\nLike the handles on the hard\ndrives on this one are purple.\n\n720\n00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:51.930\nAnd the little buttons here on\nthe power supply are purple also.\n\n721\n00:34:51.930 --> 00:34:53.600\nDoes HP like purple?\n\n722\n00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.170\nNo, well maybe, I don't know.\n\n723\n00:34:55.170 --> 00:35:00.050\nBut anytime on an HPE server that you\nsee purple, that means hot swappable.\n\n724\n00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:02.470\nThat this is something that I can\nchange while the server's online.\n\n725\n00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:06.830\nSo if my CPUs have little purple\ntabs on them, they're hot swappable.\n\n726\n00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:09.130\nLenovo, if I remember right,\nthey do light blue on theirs.\n\n727\n00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:10.010\nSo look for\n\n728\n00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.410\nweird colors like that, read the manual\nto make sure it's not just pretty.\n\n729\n00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:16.891\nBut usually it'll mean that's a hot\nswappable component, you'll find where you\n\n730\n00:35:16.891 --> 00:35:19.940\ncan get hot swap memory, hot swap\nprocessors, all sorts of neat stuff.\n\n731\n00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:24.280\n&gt;&gt; I'd say that's absolutely amazing,\nbeing able to give your server a lobotomy\n\n732\n00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.890\nwhile it's full turned on like that\n&gt;&gt; Now Don I know we're\n\n733\n00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:28.940\npushing the envelope on\nthe clock over there.\n\n734\n00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:32.870\nI know we've got a lot more hardware\nthat you'd like to show us, but\n\n735\n00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:34.890\nit looks like we're gonna\nhave to go into a part two.\n\n736\n00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:37.720\nBut before we do, do you have any\nadditional words you might like to throw\n\n737\n00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:38.560\nin this one while we're here.\n\n738\n00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just a few last things\nto be objective complete.\n\n739\n00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:46.058\nIn the exam objective they do mention arm\nprocessors, you really don't see those in\n\n740\n00:35:46.058 --> 00:35:51.051\nservers right now because they're not as\npowerful as the X86 and X64 processors.\n\n741\n00:35:51.051 --> 00:35:55.611\nBut they're way more power-efficient so\nyou're starting to see data centers trying\n\n742\n00:35:55.611 --> 00:36:00.545\nto implement those and, mark my words,\nit's 2017, by 2020 I'm certain we'll see\n\n743\n00:36:00.545 --> 00:36:04.120\narm processors in servers because\nthey're more power efficient.\n\n744\n00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.600\nWhich means you can have\na lot more of them,\n\n745\n00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.370\nwithout running your electric\nbill through the roof.\n\n746\n00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:11.030\nThese CPUs, that's a big limitation they\nhave is they do draw a lot of power.\n\n747\n00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:15.930\nThe other thing is just like any\nprocessor, with these you always have your\n\n748\n00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:20.160\nbus speed, your clocking,\nwe've got our multiplier, right?\n\n749\n00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:24.828\nAnd so, I might have a 3.4 gigahertz\nprocessor that's running at a 13/33\n\n750\n00:36:24.828 --> 00:36:28.710\nmegahertz clock and if you're an over\nclocker you know that you can go in and\n\n751\n00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.130\nmanipulate that and\nbump the speeds up or whatever.\n\n752\n00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:34.530\nServer CPUs are almost\nalways under clocked.\n\n753\n00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:37.740\nAnd you might say, well wait a minute,\nI can overclock and get some more speed.\n\n754\n00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.180\nThe reason they're under\nclocked is two reasons.\n\n755\n00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.790\nOne, temperature, right?\n\n756\n00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.140\nThey're trying to control the temperature.\n\n757\n00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.940\nYou've gotta very small space here and\n\n758\n00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.950\nyou can't have a huge heat sync\non it like you do on a desktop.\n\n759\n00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:51.847\nYou gotta small space, you can't\nover clock as much as you can, so\n\n760\n00:36:51.847 --> 00:36:53.800\nthey under clock them.\n\n761\n00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.890\nThe other reason, warranty.\n\n762\n00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:58.860\nThey're giving you a three or\na five year warranty on this stuff.\n\n763\n00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.633\nThey need to guarantee that CPU can run,\nand if it's over clocked, or\n\n764\n00:37:01.633 --> 00:37:04.460\neven clocked at full speed,\nit will have a shorter lifetime.\n\n765\n00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.040\nSo they're under clocked because of that.\n\n766\n00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:11.180\nAnd for\nthat reason you typically can't modify\n\n767\n00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:15.230\nthe clocking or\nthe multiplier because it's locked in.\n\n768\n00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:18.070\nYou have to go into the bios and\nthese vendors write their own bios.\n\n769\n00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:19.230\nSo you're not able to change that.\n\n770\n00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:22.290\nSo don't plan on over clocking\nyour servers any time soon.\n\n771\n00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:23.750\nYou wouldn't want to, even if you could.\n\n772\n00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:26.340\nSo just a little word of advice there.\n\n773\n00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.730\n&gt;&gt; What great information Don,\nwe appreciate that and\n\n774\n00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:30.780\nwe look forward to seeing\nyou in part two there,.\n\n775\n00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.220\nAnd we look forward to seeing\nyou the viewer out there.\n\n776\n00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:36.210\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n777\n00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:36.810\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n778\n00:37:36.810 -->

00:00:12.127\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:16.031\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another episode here at\nITProTV, I'm your host Wes Bryan, and in\n\n5\n00:00:16.031 --> 00:00:20.179\ntoday's episode, we are continuing through\nour series in Comp TIA Server Plus,\n\n6\n00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.506\ncoming back with a part two of\nthe fun stuff, server components.\n\n7\n00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:26.685\nAnd joining us back in the studios\ntoday is none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:27.955\nDon, how're you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:27.955 --> 00:00:30.065\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes,\nready to dive right back in.\n\n10\n00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:32.945\nIn the last episode, if you watched it,\nwe opened up a server and\n\n11\n00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:34.465\nwe started talking about some\nof the components in there.\n\n12\n00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:37.113\nWe really just focused on\nthe CPU in that last episode, so\n\n13\n00:00:37.113 --> 00:00:40.769\nwe kind of have some other parts we need\nto talk about to get through this thing.\n\n14\n00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.018\nAnd I did actually forget to mention\none thing in the last episode that I do\n\n15\n00:00:44.018 --> 00:00:45.160\nneed to cover.\n\n16\n00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.137\nIn the olden days, when you wanted\na multiprocessor server, it had multiple,\n\n17\n00:00:50.137 --> 00:00:51.635\nphysical processors.\n\n18\n00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:55.380\nAnd in the one that we're using here\nin the show, it's only got one CPU.\n\n19\n00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.280\nThat's actually really common these days.\n\n20\n00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.151\nI'm making noise,\nI'm hitting this air shroud,\n\n21\n00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:02.193\nlet me just chuck that out of there.\n\n22\n00:01:02.193 --> 00:01:04.320\nBut it's really common to have\na single CPU because now,\n\n23\n00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.910\nwe have multicore processors, right?\n\n24\n00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.640\nSo you might have one physical CPU\nin there, but it has four cores.\n\n25\n00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.450\nWell, that's the equivalent of having\nfour physical processors in the past.\n\n26\n00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.112\nBut it takes up a lot less\nspace inside of a system.\n\n27\n00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:23.568\nThey're baking those cores right\ninto the same wafer on the chip.\n\n28\n00:01:23.568 --> 00:01:27.795\nSo in today's world,\nif you have multiple physical CPUs,\n\n29\n00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:30.065\nyou've actually got a lot of cores.\n\n30\n00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:33.615\nNow be careful with that because\nsometimes, those cores are real and\n\n31\n00:01:33.615 --> 00:01:35.295\nsometimes, they aren't, right?\n\n32\n00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:39.405\nWhen we talk about technologies\nlike Intel's hyper threading, hyper\n\n33\n00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:44.285\nthreading says hey, look, inside of a CPU,\ninside of a core, you've got transistors.\n\n34\n00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:47.290\nAnd sometimes those\ntransistors are all being used.\n\n35\n00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.730\nBut sometimes,\nonly half of them are being used.\n\n36\n00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.139\nAnd if they are, we might be able to use\nthe other half to do something else, so\n\n37\n00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:55.972\nwe could actually do two instructions\nat the same time, right,\n\n38\n00:01:55.972 --> 00:01:58.188\nbecause they're using\ndifferent transistors.\n\n39\n00:01:58.188 --> 00:02:00.969\nBut that doesn't always happen,\nsometimes it does, and when it does,\n\n40\n00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.330\nit's like having double the cores, right?\n\n41\n00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.080\nBut when it doesn't happen,\nwhen you're using enough of those\n\n42\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.200\ntransistors that it can't be shared,\nthen it's like you have one.\n\n43\n00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.950\nSo they might say hey, you've got a four\ncore processor with hyper threading, and\n\n44\n00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.750\nso in Linux or Windows or\nwhatever, it shows as eight cores.\n\n45\n00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.580\nBut you don't really have eight cores.\n\n46\n00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.010\nSometimes you do, not always.\n\n47\n00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.030\nSo if you want to guarantee that you've\nalways got your cores available,\n\n48\n00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.700\nyou need to make sure\nyou have enough of them.\n\n49\n00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.920\nWhich we can achieve by having\nmultiple physical CPUs or\n\n50\n00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.720\nmultiple physical cores and\nnot count on things like hyper threading.\n\n51\n00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.575\nAMD has the same thing,\nthey call it something different.\n\n52\n00:02:39.575 --> 00:02:42.333\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Honestly, I don't know\nwhat theirs is called, hyper transport or\n\n53\n00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:43.137\nsomething like that.\n\n54\n00:02:43.137 --> 00:02:46.991\n&gt;&gt; A little crazy, but same idea,\nright, same concept as hyper threading,\n\n55\n00:02:46.991 --> 00:02:50.374\nit's just hyper threading is\na trademarked name, I imagine so.\n\n56\n00:02:50.374 --> 00:02:53.330\nBut either way, so\nyou may have multiple physical CPUs.\n\n57\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.660\nIt is less common these days.\n\n58\n00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.450\nIn fact, it's really rare to see\na server with more than 4 physical CPUs\n\n59\n00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.900\nbecause if you get the 10 or\n12 core CPUs, and\n\n60\n00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.950\nyou get 4 of them, you're talking\nabout a lot of cores right there.\n\n61\n00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.059\nAnd that's what most people need and\nwe can always add more servers and\n\n62\n00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:10.170\ncluster them together.\n\n63\n00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.427\nBut in the olden days when clusters\nweren't so well supported,\n\n64\n00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:16.400\nhaving multiple physical CPUs\nwas the way to handle that.\n\n65\n00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.720\nSo just be aware that's\na variation you'll see in servers,\n\n66\n00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.534\nthat I didn't really focus\non in the last episode.\n\n67\n00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:25.770\nAll right, moving on from CPUs though,\nwe've got a lot of the stuff in here,\n\n68\n00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.300\nso let's just kind of move down the list.\n\n69\n00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.120\nI wanna talk about RAM next.\n\n70\n00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.000\nWhen you look inside of this server,\n\n71\n00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.770\nit looks a lot like a workstation\nas far as RAM is concerned.\n\n72\n00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.500\nIn fact, the biggest difference\nyou'll notice at looking at a server\n\n73\n00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.710\nis there's usually just more slots.\n\n74\n00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.200\nIn a typical workstation, you're gonna\nhave what, 4, maybe 6 slots for memory.\n\n75\n00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.120\nBut in a server, you could have 24 slots.\n\n76\n00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.622\nI think I showed one two episodes ago of a\nserver that had 24 slots for memory in it.\n\n77\n00:03:51.622 --> 00:03:54.450\nAnd that's because servers\ncan really eat up RAM.\n\n78\n00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.060\nIf you're running a relational database,\na relational database will try and\n\n79\n00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.900\ncache all of its indexes into RAM.\n\n80\n00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.712\nSo it needs to have RAM that's big\nenough to be able to contain those,\n\n81\n00:04:02.712 --> 00:04:03.739\nyou need a lot of memory.\n\n82\n00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.750\nIf you're running a virtualization server,\nyou have a lot of virtual machines,\n\n83\n00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.950\neach one needs RAM.\n\n84\n00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.860\nYou're gonna need a lot of memory.\n\n85\n00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.010\nSo servers are designed to handle\nmore RAM than a typical workstation.\n\n86\n00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.670\nAnd it gets expensive when you start\ngetting into the larger memory sizes.\n\n87\n00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.690\nBut on a server, it's worth it because\nof the way that you're using it.\n\n88\n00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.870\nNow just because there's more slots\ndoesn't mean we can just start chucking\n\n89\n00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.640\nmemory in there willy nilly, right?\n\n90\n00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.516\nThat we need to make sure that\nwe're getting the right memory and\n\n91\n00:04:29.516 --> 00:04:31.940\nthat we're putting it\ninto the right slots.\n\n92\n00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.950\nWhen you look at this server,\n\n93\n00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.190\nyou'll notice how some of them are labeled\nas white and some are black, right?\n\n94\n00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.140\nWhat it’s telling me is which\nones need to be populated first.\n\n95\n00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.720\nThe white ones here need\nto be populated first.\n\n96\n00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.060\nAnd then I can populate\nthe black ones after that.\n\n97\n00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.610\nAnd then on the motherboard,\n\n98\n00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.910\nit's really hard to see here, but there's\nactually writing on the motherboard\n\n99\n00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.080\nthat's telling me which channel\neach of these are a part of.\n\n100\n00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.600\nAnd that's something that I showed\nin the last episode that was written\n\n101\n00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.140\non the lid of the server\nwhen we popped that lid off.\n\n102\n00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.580\nIt actually had the channels that\nlooked easier to see on the lid.\n\n103\n00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.490\nSo we saw that on the last episode.\n\n104\n00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.500\nBut when I put the memory in,\n\n105\n00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.270\nI need to make sure I follow\nthe order that my vendor specifies.\n\n106\n00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.520\nAnd there's not a standard in use here.\n\n107\n00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.390\nSo make sure you read\nthe vendor documentation.\n\n108\n00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.740\nThe other thing is it\ndoes use standard memory.\n\n109\n00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.740\nMost servers use standard memory,\nbut standard for\n\n110\n00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.340\na server is different than\nthe standard for a workstation.\n\n111\n00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.986\nIn a workstation,\nI'm just gonna go out and buy DDR3,\n\n112\n00:05:22.986 --> 00:05:24.632\nwhatever the fastest is I can get.\n\n113\n00:05:24.632 --> 00:05:27.753\nAnd if I pick something at too high a\nclock rate, the motherboard just steps it\n\n114\n00:05:27.753 --> 00:05:30.720\ndown to the clock rate that's\nsupported and off you go.\n\n115\n00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.160\nOn a server,\nyou have to be a little more careful.\n\n116\n00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.640\nFirst off, most desktop memory\nis what's called non-ECC memory.\n\n117\n00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.250\nServers use ECC memory.\n\n118\n00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.509\nECC is error checking, right?\n\n119\n00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.543\nIt does a little error\nchecking to make sure,\n\n120\n00:05:45.543 --> 00:05:48.740\nor it's actually error correcting\ncode is what it stands for.\n\n121\n00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.540\nBut it means that the memory is\nwatching for hey, I just wrote a one.\n\n122\n00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.170\nBut when I do a read off of it,\nI'm not getting a one back.\n\n123\n00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.880\nMaybe I'm supposed to get a one or a zero.\n\n124\n00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.140\nBut instead I'm getting a voltage\nlevel that's just not quite right.\n\n125\n00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.350\nIt doesn't match up with a one or a zero.\n\n126\n00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.750\nSo the memory has got a problem.\n\n127\n00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.410\nIt happens, memory does fail.\n\n128\n00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.940\nMemory typically runs hot and\n\n129\n00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.720\nany component that gets hot\nover time will break, right?\n\n130\n00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.680\nSo memory does fail, CPUs, pretty rare.\n\n131\n00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.420\nMemory, not so rare,\nyou do have memory sticks that fail.\n\n132\n00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.670\n&gt;&gt; Don, when it comes to these memory\ntypes, ECC, non ECC, are they gonna be\n\n133\n00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.270\ncompatible together, or do we have\nto pay attention to that as well?\n\n134\n00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.160\n&gt;&gt; You gotta pay attention.\n\n135\n00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.309\nYep, if you've got one ECC stick and\nthen some non ECC,\n\n136\n00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:32.119\nit's not normally gonna boot.\n\n137\n00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:34.910\nYou're gonna push a button, and you're\ngonna get those beep codes thrown at you.\n\n138\n00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.540\nSo it needs to be all ECC, and\nmost of the servers require it.\n\n139\n00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.860\nSo if you put non-ECC memory in there,\nthey just won't start.\n\n140\n00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.900\nSpeaking of requirements, you can't\nnormally just buy third party memory and\n\n141\n00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.920\nchuck them in there either.\n\n142\n00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.813\nIf you do,\nit's not gonna be covered under warranty.\n\n143\n00:06:47.813 --> 00:06:50.570\nThey're not gonna support you as long\nas you have that memory in there.\n\n144\n00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.690\nThe other thing is, by buying\nthe memory directly from the vendor,\n\n145\n00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.380\nthey make sure that it is\nthe right memory for your system.\n\n146\n00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.930\nThey're gonna charge you more for it,\nbut they're gonna honor the warranty and\n\n147\n00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.610\nit's gonna be the right one for\nyour system.\n\n148\n00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.790\nSo you do need to pay\nattention to the speed.\n\n149\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.320\nAnd you need to pay attention\nto whether it's ECC or not.\n\n150\n00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.710\nMost servers these days support DDR2 and\nDDR3 memory, usually one or the other.\n\n151\n00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.660\nDDR is double data rate and\ndouble data rate version 2,\n\n152\n00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.740\ndouble data rate version 3,\nwhich are all types of SD RAM.\n\n153\n00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.690\nIt's pretty common, the ECC part is\nwhat becomes not so common, right?\n\n154\n00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.250\nThe other thing is that some\nservers support redundant memory.\n\n155\n00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.500\nRedundant memory is a really neat thing.\n\n156\n00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.030\nIf you have a memory chip that fails,\nwhat do you have to do?\n\n157\n00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.530\nShut the server down, take the bad\nchip out, put the new stick in,\n\n158\n00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.840\npower the system back up, right?\n\n159\n00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.690\nSo, you had a stick go bad,\nwhich means you lost data,\n\n160\n00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.730\nand then you have to take the server\noffline so you had downtime.\n\n161\n00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:48.887\nWell, if you have redundant memory,\nredundant memory says hey, everything I\n\n162\n00:07:48.887 --> 00:07:52.499\nwrite to this stick, I'm gonna write\nto this stick at the same time.\n\n163\n00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:56.950\nNow if a chip goes bad, we just switch\nover to the other bank of memory.\n\n164\n00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.248\nAnd the other bank of memory is\nkept identical to the first bank.\n\n165\n00:08:00.248 --> 00:08:03.834\nOn a positive side, that means we can\nsurvive memory failures without turning\n\n166\n00:08:03.834 --> 00:08:05.900\nthe server off, without losing data.\n\n167\n00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.210\nIt's seamless.\n\n168\n00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.670\nOn a negative side, it means we have\nto pay twice as much for memory.\n\n169\n00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.820\nBecause for every gig of memory we\nbuy we have to buy a second gig for\n\n170\n00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.350\nthe redundant side of it.\n\n171\n00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.850\nSo, to shave that cost down a little bit,\n\n172\n00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.590\nsome vendors support what\nthey'll call RAID memory.\n\n173\n00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.420\nRaid we normally think of hard drives,\nright?\n\n174\n00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.440\nA redundant array of\nindependent disks where\n\n175\n00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.270\nwe stripe our data across the discs and\nwe have parity blocks so\n\n176\n00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:35.060\nthat if a disk fails we can just\nuse the parity to reconstruct it.\n\n177\n00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.860\nSome vendors support memory that way.\n\n178\n00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.200\nWhere they can stripe it across\nthe memory and have parity blocks.\n\n179\n00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.980\nThey don't normally stripe the memory\nthey just write to a single\n\n180\n00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.200\nstick and do parity.\n\n181\n00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.211\nAnd then as they read data\nthey can verify it and\n\n182\n00:08:47.211 --> 00:08:49.920\nthey can use parity to\nreconstruct if they lose things.\n\n183\n00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.480\nSo when they do that they don't have to\nhave a one for one match on the memory.\n\n184\n00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.860\nThey just have to have enough to\nhold the parity and that's it.\n\n185\n00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.340\nSo that cuts down on the cost.\n\n186\n00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.320\nThis server doesn't support either.\n\n187\n00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.070\nIt's normally pretty obvious cuz you'll\nhave a completely separate bank of memory\n\n188\n00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.700\nor some special slots that are off\nto the side which account for that.\n\n189\n00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.260\nSometimes it'll be that you\nhave a odd number of slots.\n\n190\n00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.890\nThis server has an odd number of slots,\nbut it is because there's three channels\n\n191\n00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:20.460\nand it's got three channels and\nwas it three sticks each and so,\n\n192\n00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.550\nit ends up at nine slots, but\nit doesn't actually have a parody on.\n\n193\n00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:29.090\nSo, you can't just count on the number\nof slots to tell you on that one.\n\n194\n00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.510\nBut that's one of the things we\nneed to be aware of with memory.\n\n195\n00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.700\nKnow that server memory is usually\nmore expensive because it's ECC.\n\n196\n00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.190\nAnd if you try and\nbuy the cheaper memory, it may work.\n\n197\n00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.470\nSome servers will support it, but most\nwon't and the reality is you want ECC.\n\n198\n00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.690\nOn a workstation if you have failing\nmemory, what's gonna happen?\n\n199\n00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.330\nWell I tried to shoot an alien.\n\n200\n00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.210\nAnd the game froze, and\nI crashed the desktop.\n\n201\n00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.840\nSo I relaunched the game, then I went and\nI shot the alien in the face.\n\n202\n00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.990\nRight, that's what happens.\n\n203\n00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.720\nOn a server,\nI just lost a financial transaction.\n\n204\n00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.300\nAnd I withdrew a million dollars\nout of one company's account.\n\n205\n00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.530\nAnd it didn't get deposited in another.\n\n206\n00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.870\nAnd that money just disappeared.\n\n207\n00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.120\nRight?\nIn a production,\n\n208\n00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.350\nin enterprise environment,\nyou can't mistakes like that.\n\n209\n00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.160\nAnd they usually result in\nthe server freezing anyway.\n\n210\n00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.140\nWhen memory starts to fail,\nyour server typically locks up and so\n\n211\n00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.860\nnow you've got a server that goes offline.\n\n212\n00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.480\nSo we need ECC so\nwe can spot when those errors happen,\n\n213\n00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.000\nand we can get alerted,\nand we can take action.\n\n214\n00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.390\nAnd the servers,\nthey have embedded management on them.\n\n215\n00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.920\nWhen they monitor for these alerts, and\nas soon as they see an ECC event trigger,\n\n216\n00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.340\nthey can tell you there was a failure and\ntell you exactly which slot.\n\n217\n00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.030\nSo you know exactly which\nmemory chip to replace and\n\n218\n00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.950\nthat's a very valuable thing to have,\nespecially in a server.\n\n219\n00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:46.010\nAll right, most of the servers\nthat you buy today are DDR2 and\n\n220\n00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.680\nDDR3 like I said so\nthe slots are gonna be.\n\n221\n00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.064\nWes, do you remember\nthe pin count on those?\n\n222\n00:10:50.064 --> 00:10:54.704\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I believe the DDR2 is 240\npins and the DDR3 is 240 pins,\n\n223\n00:10:54.704 --> 00:11:00.350\nI know it's not on the exam might as\nwell mention it, new DDR4 is 256 pins.\n\n224\n00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.740\n&gt;&gt; All right so when you're talking\nabout DDR4, it's more pins.\n\n225\n00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:04.690\nYou can see the different slot.\n\n226\n00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:08.660\nBut when you're talking about DDR2 and\nDDR3, it's the same pins.\n\n227\n00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.590\nThe slots look the same.\n\n228\n00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.720\nIt's hard to tell.\n\n229\n00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.530\nSo you gotta rely on that documentation,\nright?\n\n230\n00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.900\nMake sure you read your server\ndocumentation to find out what's the right\n\n231\n00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.540\nmemory for your system.\n\n232\n00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.110\nAnd, you may support aftermarket memory.\n\n233\n00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.370\nYou might be able to go to Crucial or\nLightning or\n\n234\n00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:22.480\nsomewhere like that and buy memory.\n\n235\n00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.200\nIt'll be far less expensive.\n\n236\n00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.570\nBut if it's still under warranty,\n\n237\n00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.800\nyou usually do need to stick\nwith the vendor's memory.\n\n238\n00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.348\nAll right, a couple other things,\nstatic and dynamic memory.\n\n239\n00:11:31.348 --> 00:11:37.070\nStatic and dynamic memory are kinda\ninteresting concepts that we really\n\n240\n00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:41.410\nsee in a few different environments,\nbut in virtualization environments.\n\n241\n00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:45.020\nWhere you have VMs that might\nneed a fixed amount of memory, or\n\n242\n00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.470\nthey might be able to share\nmemory amongst their systems and\n\n243\n00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:52.100\nshare that so\nthat we can oversubscribe our memory.\n\n244\n00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.030\nA lot of systems support this.\n\n245\n00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:57.210\nIt can have hardware support in\na server for doing that too.\n\n246\n00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:00.680\nYou can have where memory is brought\ninto the pool or taken out of the pool.\n\n247\n00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.890\nSo it's not always available.\n\n248\n00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:08.270\nIt's a common enough feature, but not\nmany people actually make use of it and\n\n249\n00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.380\nthe reason is there can\nbe inconsistencies.\n\n250\n00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.300\nNormally if a server has\na certain amount of memory,\n\n251\n00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.370\nwe wanna make sure it always\nhas that amount of memory.\n\n252\n00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.570\nWhen you start doing dynamic memory,\nwhere servers try and\n\n253\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.600\ngrab memory when its available, every now\nand then they're gonna try and grab it and\n\n254\n00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.390\nit's not gonna be available.\n\n255\n00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:22.770\nSomebody else has already grabbed it.\n\n256\n00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.560\nAnd so now we get inconsistent\nperformance, and so\n\n257\n00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.950\nthat's why a lot of places\ndon't like to leverage it.\n\n258\n00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.970\nIt's really designed for test and\ndevelopment networks where\n\n259\n00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.970\nwe don't necessarily need consistent\nperformance for our customer, right?\n\n260\n00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.610\nVerses our production systems where you\nalways want your customers have the best\n\n261\n00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:38.470\nexperience possible.\n\n262\n00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.090\nSo there are some little bells and\nwhistles and\n\n263\n00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.060\ntreats like that that are out there.\n\n264\n00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.840\nThat you may not wanna take avenge\nof even of your server supports.\n\n265\n00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.300\nAll right few other things,\nmodule placement.\n\n266\n00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.800\nWhat you're looking at here on\nthis server is pretty standard.\n\n267\n00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.860\nThe memory banks are all right here,\nthe CPU is right here.\n\n268\n00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.200\nMemory is usually as close to\nthe processor as possible.\n\n269\n00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.260\nBecause the shorter that bus is, the\nphysical shortness makes it faster, right?\n\n270\n00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.820\nAnd the closer you get them, the better\nperformance you're gonna get out of it.\n\n271\n00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.320\nSo, that's what you normally see.\n\n272\n00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.790\nIt's not always the case.\n\n273\n00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.245\nEspecially if your server\nhas 48 memory slots.\n\n274\n00:13:13.245 --> 00:13:15.485\nYou're not gonna have them all\nlaid out right here on the board.\n\n275\n00:13:15.485 --> 00:13:18.195\nIn fact, you're normally gonna\nhave riser cards, right?\n\n276\n00:13:18.195 --> 00:13:21.825\nRiser cards will stick up from\nthe motherboard and the memory will\n\n277\n00:13:21.825 --> 00:13:25.545\nplant in sideways or even diagonal to\nmake room and be able to fit in there.\n\n278\n00:13:25.545 --> 00:13:27.505\nAnd that's just because of space and\n\n279\n00:13:27.505 --> 00:13:29.835\nbecause the amount of\nmemory you've got on there.\n\n280\n00:13:29.835 --> 00:13:33.210\nNow in those scenarios you're dealing\nwith something very different\n\n281\n00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:34.780\nthan what you would ever\nsee in a workstation.\n\n282\n00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.310\nDefinitely not ATX standard, right,\n\n283\n00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.500\nto have memory up on a riser,\nbut it does happen.\n\n284\n00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.220\nRiser cards are not uncommon in larger\nservers, but we even see them here,\n\n285\n00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.280\nI'll talk about one in a moment\nhere when we get to PCI stuff.\n\n286\n00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.910\nBut you'll see them with cards just\nbecause of the small amount of\n\n287\n00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.130\nspace that we have.\n\n288\n00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:54.800\nSo, memory module placement you'll\nneed to look at your board.\n\n289\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.740\nIt is different where physically is and\n\n290\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.760\nas far as which slots you enter\nthe chips in I've already talked about.\n\n291\n00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.940\nThey might be colored.\n\n292\n00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:01.680\nThey might not be.\n\n293\n00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.290\nYou'll have to locate that position and\n\n294\n00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:04.639\nmake sure you get that\nright from your board.\n\n295\n00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.080\nAll right what else do we\nhave to say about memory?\n\n296\n00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.710\nMemory in a server,\n\n297\n00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:16.930\naside from being ECC it's pretty standard\nas far as what we'd use in a work station.\n\n298\n00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.570\nRemember when you buy memory it normally\nhas three numbers attached to it.\n\n299\n00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:23.565\nSo you'll buy some well\nhere's four numbers,\n\n300\n00:14:23.565 --> 00:14:29.680\nsome DDR3,1666 megahertz memory,\nthat's the bus speed of that memory.\n\n301\n00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.115\nAnd then there'll be three\nnumbers like 999, right?\n\n302\n00:14:33.115 --> 00:14:37.460\n9-9-9 or 9-8-9 or something like that.\n\n303\n00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.450\nAnd what those numbers are doing?\n\n304\n00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.430\nIs they're telling you some additional\ninformation about the timing and\n\n305\n00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.540\nthe cast latency and\nall that good stuff about the memory.\n\n306\n00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.050\nBasically the rule of thump is\nthe smaller the number, the better.\n\n307\n00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.150\nYou want the smallest number possible.\n\n308\n00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.640\nThe bigger the number usually the cheaper\nthe memory is, but the memory is slower.\n\n309\n00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.260\nNow on a work station, you're the only\none performing operations and\n\n310\n00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.400\nmemory is already really fast.\n\n311\n00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.580\nSo we don't really\nfixate on these numbers.\n\n312\n00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.840\nBut on a server,\nthese are kinda important.\n\n313\n00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.690\nSo like CAS latency, right?\n\n314\n00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.990\nCAS latency, it stands for\ncolumn, access, strobe, latency.\n\n315\n00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.880\nWhen the memory chip says,\n\n316\n00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.850\nall right I need to read from this\nparticular location in memory.\n\n317\n00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.690\nWell memory's all arranged in columns.\n\n318\n00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.300\nAnd so all the little spots\nwhere it stores the ones and\n\n319\n00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.310\nzero are all arranged in columns.\n\n320\n00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:28.370\nSo when it requests,\ndata requested via the column.\n\n321\n00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:33.100\nAnd so when it sends the instruction\nsaying give me this particular column.\n\n322\n00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.970\nHow long does it take the physical\nchip to respond to that request?\n\n323\n00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.860\nIt's received the request,\nhow long does it take to respond?\n\n324\n00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.950\nThat's a mechanical operation, right?\n\n325\n00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.127\nIt's not a moving part, but\nit is an electrical operation,\n\n326\n00:15:45.127 --> 00:15:48.739\nwe send an instruction, a chip has\nto say I'm gonna grab this data and\n\n327\n00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:51.569\nhand it off to you,\nit takes a certain amount of time.\n\n328\n00:15:51.569 --> 00:15:53.990\nAnd so they measure that and\nthat's the cast latency.\n\n329\n00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:58.656\nThe shorter your cast latency,\nThe faster you're able to request data and\n\n330\n00:15:58.656 --> 00:15:59.848\nget it back again.\n\n331\n00:15:59.848 --> 00:16:02.299\nNow you still have your bus\nthat's gonna limit your speed,\n\n332\n00:16:02.299 --> 00:16:04.560\nyou still have your CPU and\nall the other things.\n\n333\n00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:09.670\nSo these numbers are normally so\nsmall that going between a nine and\n\n334\n00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:13.620\nan eight of CAS latency is not\nnoticeable to us, as a human.\n\n335\n00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.660\nBut to a computer it's noticeable,\nand if it's doing enough operations,\n\n336\n00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.440\nthat makes a big difference.\n\n337\n00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.530\nSo when you buy memory for a server,\nthose numbers are important\n\n338\n00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:25.220\nespecially if you're trying to get\nthe best performance out of your hardware.\n\n339\n00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:29.691\nI'll be honest with you, for me, I'm not\nusually that worried about it, right?\n\n340\n00:16:29.691 --> 00:16:32.727\nBut if you're doing high\nperformance computing,\n\n341\n00:16:32.727 --> 00:16:37.387\nif you're sequencing the human genome\nthat little nano second that you gain,\n\n342\n00:16:37.387 --> 00:16:41.060\nif it was just one operation,\nit wouldn't matter.\n\n343\n00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:45.663\nBut if it was millions of operations\na day, over the course of three months.\n\n344\n00:16:45.663 --> 00:16:50.465\nYou could be saving hours of time\nby just being one cast value lower\n\n345\n00:16:50.465 --> 00:16:52.835\nthan what the normal memory is.\n\n346\n00:16:52.835 --> 00:16:55.897\nSo you'll wanna pay attention to\nthose extra numbers they provide you,\n\n347\n00:16:55.897 --> 00:16:59.124\nthat help you to make sure you're\ngetting the best, highest performance.\n\n348\n00:16:59.124 --> 00:17:00.981\nAnd you need to make sure that\nyour board supports it, right?\n\n349\n00:17:00.981 --> 00:17:02.888\nBecause you do have a chip\nset on your motherboard.\n\n350\n00:17:02.888 --> 00:17:06.028\nIt is controlling that access and\nrecognizing that memory.\n\n351\n00:17:06.028 --> 00:17:09.110\nAnd if it's not able to operate certain\nspeeds then that'll be a problem.\n\n352\n00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:12.162\nIt also has to be able\nto detect the memory.\n\n353\n00:17:12.162 --> 00:17:14.113\nSo w're gonna cover BIOS\nin another episode.\n\n354\n00:17:14.113 --> 00:17:17.377\nBut you may have to go into the BIOS of\nthe server to make sure it has detected it\n\n355\n00:17:17.377 --> 00:17:17.892\nproperly.\n\n356\n00:17:17.892 --> 00:17:20.173\nIf you're using the vendors memory,\nthat will happen.\n\n357\n00:17:20.173 --> 00:17:21.152\nIt will detect it properly.\n\n358\n00:17:21.152 --> 00:17:25.374\nBut if you're using third party memory,\nyou might have to go in and over ride it.\n\n359\n00:17:25.374 --> 00:17:28.320\nAnd I'll tell you, a lot of vendors\ndon't allow you to do that.\n\n360\n00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.860\nBecause they're worried that you\nmight set the values wrong and\n\n361\n00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.480\nit affects the performance and\nthen you do a warranty call.\n\n362\n00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.020\nSo if you buy third party memory, you\nmight be running at a lower performance\n\n363\n00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.880\nand not have any course of action,\nnot have a way to fix.\n\n364\n00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.827\nSo always be aware of that when\ndealing with memory on a server.\n\n365\n00:17:43.827 --> 00:17:47.880\nAll right, I mentioned other riser cards.\n\n366\n00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:52.520\nOne of the main area's we see riser cards\nin servers are with the PCI slots, right?\n\n367\n00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.120\nOn the back of the server,\n\n368\n00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:59.420\nif we look towards the back of it\nwe've got our PCI slots way back here.\n\n369\n00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.380\nAnd normally, on a work station\nyou have a whole row of PCI slots.\n\n370\n00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.961\nBut I don't have that here, and\nthe reason I don't is this server is 1RU,\n\n371\n00:18:07.961 --> 00:18:10.350\nit's 1.75 inches tall.\n\n372\n00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:14.980\nSo for PCI card to go in here\nthat if to be less than inch tall\n\n373\n00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:20.310\nto be able to clear the case and a one\ninch PCI Card, that just not gonna happen.\n\n374\n00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.630\nSo instead of having\nPCI slots like normal,\n\n375\n00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:28.890\nthere's typically going to be a riser\nthat turns the PCI card sideways.\n\n376\n00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:32.130\nIf it's sideways, it can be a toll card,\nand go into the side.\n\n377\n00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:36.280\nSo in here, I see PCIe slot and\nit's turned sideways.\n\n378\n00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.860\nAnd it's covered up,\nit's actually one on the other side too.\n\n379\n00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.620\nLet me take this rizor board out.\n\n380\n00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.340\nRizor boards typically plug right\ninto a PCIe slot on the board,\n\n381\n00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.600\nand then just come up and\nturn like an L to make the port sideways.\n\n382\n00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.830\nSo I'm gonna remove this board real quick.\n\n383\n00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:53.090\nLet me just lean over here and\nget this screw out.\n\n384\n00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.309\nThere's one screw that\nholds this riser in.\n\n385\n00:18:56.309 --> 00:19:01.212\nRisers are typically removable, because\nthere's no real way to get a PCIe card in\n\n386\n00:19:01.212 --> 00:19:03.780\nthem while they're in here like they are.\n\n387\n00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.180\nThere's just not enough room.\n\n388\n00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:09.237\nSo you have to take them out to add or\nremove a card and then put them back in.\n\n389\n00:19:09.237 --> 00:19:11.992\nOnce that screw's out,\n\n390\n00:19:11.992 --> 00:19:17.772\nI can grab this whole card and\njust pull straight up.\n\n391\n00:19:17.772 --> 00:19:18.479\nThere we go.\n\n392\n00:19:18.479 --> 00:19:23.735\nAll right, we can gently pull straight\nup to pop that whole assembly out.\n\n393\n00:19:23.735 --> 00:19:25.965\nSo this whole assembly just came out and\n\n394\n00:19:25.965 --> 00:19:29.965\nnow you can clearly see the RAID\ncontroller that was turned sideways.\n\n395\n00:19:29.965 --> 00:19:32.563\nIt was probably hard to see, when it\nwas right up against the motherboard.\n\n396\n00:19:32.563 --> 00:19:33.964\nBut now that it's out here and\n\n397\n00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:37.820\nturned sideways you can see that\nit's plugged into slot right here.\n\n398\n00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.238\nAnd if I flip it over,\nand we look at the bottom,\n\n399\n00:19:41.238 --> 00:19:45.520\nsee how it's got these two\nlittle PCI interfaces, right?\n\n400\n00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.503\nThese are PCIe, sorry.\n\n401\n00:19:48.503 --> 00:19:51.610\nBut on this one,\nyou can see it really clearly.\n\n402\n00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.726\nI've got the PCIe interface\nthat points down, and\n\n403\n00:19:54.726 --> 00:19:59.158\nthen on the card there's another\nPCIe interface that points sideways.\n\n404\n00:19:59.158 --> 00:20:03.478\nSo this plugs into the motherboard,\nand then it turns and\n\n405\n00:20:03.478 --> 00:20:09.337\nthen here is where I can plug in my own\nPCIe card and add that card to the system.\n\n406\n00:20:09.337 --> 00:20:14.535\nAnd it's sideways, so it's able to\nstick out the back of the server.\n\n407\n00:20:14.535 --> 00:20:17.624\nAnd this looks like what you'd normally\nsee on the back of a work station, right?\n\n408\n00:20:17.624 --> 00:20:19.554\nThis is a standard PCIe card slots.\n\n409\n00:20:19.554 --> 00:20:23.189\nIt's full size, not what do\nthey call those half size ones?\n\n410\n00:20:23.189 --> 00:20:24.012\n&gt;&gt; The minis.\n\n411\n00:20:24.012 --> 00:20:24.854\n&gt;&gt; The minis.\n\n412\n00:20:24.854 --> 00:20:27.590\nSo it's not like a mini piece guys, it's\na full size PCI card turned side ways.\n\n413\n00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:32.408\nAnd that's why this card is so\nlong, that's why I've got this big\n\n414\n00:20:32.408 --> 00:20:36.639\nopen space and\nthis little weird plastic clip right here.\n\n415\n00:20:36.639 --> 00:20:41.227\nSo that when a full length card goes\nin this slot, it's able to snap in and\n\n416\n00:20:41.227 --> 00:20:41.841\nbe held.\n\n417\n00:20:41.841 --> 00:20:45.076\nIf it's a long one that will give it\nthe stability to be able to lock in.\n\n418\n00:20:45.076 --> 00:20:50.342\nAnd now that card is sideways, so\nI can drop it right down in here and\n\n419\n00:20:50.342 --> 00:20:53.935\nmy server can still be 1.75 inches tall.\n\n420\n00:20:53.935 --> 00:20:56.717\nThese little riser boards,\nthere's no crazy science in them.\n\n421\n00:20:56.717 --> 00:21:01.078\nIt's just copper or wiring that\ncomes in and turns in an L, right?\n\n422\n00:21:01.078 --> 00:21:02.237\nThere's no real magic to them.\n\n423\n00:21:02.237 --> 00:21:06.577\nThere is some circuitry on here that helps\nwith the detection of the board that's on\n\n424\n00:21:06.577 --> 00:21:08.752\nthere, and does some power regulation.\n\n425\n00:21:08.752 --> 00:21:11.807\nBut other than that,\nit's not really doing all that much.\n\n426\n00:21:11.807 --> 00:21:14.612\nThe real magic is simply just\nwires that run and turn, and\n\n427\n00:21:14.612 --> 00:21:16.143\nwe've put a card in sideways.\n\n428\n00:21:16.143 --> 00:21:20.080\nSo that's a riser board, and\nyou'll see these pretty commonly.\n\n429\n00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.690\nDo be aware that riser boards\ncan't change the standard.\n\n430\n00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.734\nSo if it's a PCI slot on the board,\nit's a PCI slot here.\n\n431\n00:21:27.734 --> 00:21:31.909\nIf it's a PCIe slot on the board,\nit's PCIe here, and if it's PCI-X,\n\n432\n00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:34.190\nthen it's gonna be that here.\n\n433\n00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.950\nNow those three standards,\nwhen you're dealing with a server,\n\n434\n00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.720\nthe PCI cards are usually\ngonna be one of those three.\n\n435\n00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.720\nPCI is really old, so hopefully,\nyou don't have those and\n\n436\n00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.530\nI always forget the acronym, it's a-\n&gt;&gt; Peripheral component interconnect.\n\n437\n00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.927\n&gt;&gt; Actually, Wes our infinite\nvolume of acronyms knowledge.\n\n438\n00:21:50.927 --> 00:21:54.524\nSo PCI, it's been around a long time,\n\n439\n00:21:54.524 --> 00:21:58.046\nreplaced ISA the old-\n&gt;&gt; Industry standard architecture.\n\n440\n00:21:58.046 --> 00:21:59.409\n&gt;&gt; Wow, you know the old stuff, too.\n\n441\n00:21:59.409 --> 00:22:03.399\n[LAUGH] So that was super ancient,\nbut PCI's old too.\n\n442\n00:22:03.399 --> 00:22:05.486\nPCI runs at 66 megahertz, and\n\n443\n00:22:05.486 --> 00:22:09.595\nit was capable of moving a decent\namount of data back in the day.\n\n444\n00:22:09.595 --> 00:22:12.030\nBut it really wasn't fast enough for\nservers.\n\n445\n00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:15.922\nSo in the late 90s and\nearly 2000s we got PCI-X.\n\n446\n00:22:15.922 --> 00:22:19.125\nAnd what PCI-X did,\nthe X stood for extended.\n\n447\n00:22:19.125 --> 00:22:24.899\nPCI-X basically bumped up that speed and\nwent from 66 hertz up to 133.\n\n448\n00:22:24.899 --> 00:22:29.492\nI'm sorry, it's megahertz, went from 66\nmegahertz up to 133 megahertz, right?\n\n449\n00:22:29.492 --> 00:22:35.488\nSo more than double, or just a hair more\nthan double what the speed was of PCI.\n\n450\n00:22:35.488 --> 00:22:39.316\nAnd so that allowed us to get faster\nperformance in a server where we needed\n\n451\n00:22:39.316 --> 00:22:40.005\nit, right?\n\n452\n00:22:40.005 --> 00:22:40.867\nBecause what's that card gonna be?\n\n453\n00:22:40.867 --> 00:22:43.647\nMaybe a hard drive controller or\nrate controller, so\n\n454\n00:22:43.647 --> 00:22:45.810\nall your this guy IO is going through it.\n\n455\n00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.555\nMaybe it's a network adapter or\n\n456\n00:22:47.555 --> 00:22:50.080\nsomething where we have a huge\namount of data moving though it.\n\n457\n00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.353\nThat's important,\nwe need the higher bus speeds.\n\n458\n00:22:52.353 --> 00:22:56.890\nWell PCI-X has largely been\nreplaced these days by PCIe.\n\n459\n00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.415\nAnd PCIe, the E is enhanced.\n\n460\n00:22:59.415 --> 00:23:04.160\nIt makes it kind of hard because E could\nbe extended also, but it's enhanced.\n\n461\n00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.342\nAnd you see PCIe in desktops always now,\nand\n\n462\n00:23:07.342 --> 00:23:10.874\nyou see it in servers\npretty much always now too.\n\n463\n00:23:10.874 --> 00:23:12.598\nAnd with PCIe,\nthere's multiple levels of it.\n\n464\n00:23:12.598 --> 00:23:17.795\nSo their's PCIe one, two, three, four\nactually there isn't a three is there?\n\n465\n00:23:17.795 --> 00:23:18.478\nThey skip that one?\n\n466\n00:23:18.478 --> 00:23:22.139\n&gt;&gt; No, it's one, four,\nthere is a two I believe.\n\n467\n00:23:22.139 --> 00:23:24.150\nBut I know there's 1, 4, 8 and 16.\n\n468\n00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:28.151\nAnd so with those, what we're talking\nabout, and Wes said it right there,\n\n469\n00:23:28.151 --> 00:23:29.222\nare lanes, right?\n\n470\n00:23:29.222 --> 00:23:31.437\nSo increased bandwidth\nto get into the card.\n\n471\n00:23:31.437 --> 00:23:35.495\nIt doesn't necessarily have a higher\nclock rate, because it doesn't need it,\n\n472\n00:23:35.495 --> 00:23:36.460\nit has more lanes.\n\n473\n00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.940\nIt can do more simultaneous activities.\n\n474\n00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.053\nSo when PCIe first came out, PCIe one and\n\n475\n00:23:42.053 --> 00:23:47.925\ntwo weren't any faster than PCI-X and\nso a lot of servers stayed at PCI-X.\n\n476\n00:23:47.925 --> 00:23:50.265\nSo you still see it in some\nservers that are in production.\n\n477\n00:23:50.265 --> 00:23:53.611\nNot servers that are sold today,\nbut ones that are in production.\n\n478\n00:23:53.611 --> 00:23:59.170\nBut then when we got to PCIe 4,\nit was now officially faster than PCIx.\n\n479\n00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:03.160\nAnd so when that happened, you saw servers\nlike this one where they just ditched PCIx\n\n480\n00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.818\naltogether and you just had PCIe,\nand now you get that.\n\n481\n00:24:06.818 --> 00:24:09.780\nAnd so you;ll see the four and\neight and 16,\n\n482\n00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.650\n16's pretty common these days, way faster.\n\n483\n00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.800\nSo those are the interface\ntypes that you'll see.\n\n484\n00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.580\nThe nice part about PCIe\nis it's all compatible.\n\n485\n00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.620\nSo if I have a PCIE 16 slot,\n\n486\n00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:23.040\nand I drop a PCIe 4 card there,\nit just slows down the 4.\n\n487\n00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.820\nIt just uses the channels that\nare available to it and so\n\n488\n00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.950\nthat gives us a lot of flexibility there.\n\n489\n00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.500\nAs far as cards that we add in though,\nthere's not much you add to a server.\n\n490\n00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.680\nMost servers have integrated\nnetwork adapters.\n\n491\n00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.400\nMost servers have integrated video.\n\n492\n00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.920\nMost servers don't have audio cuz\nyou don't need audio on a server.\n\n493\n00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:42.300\nThey probably have an integrated\nhard drive and RAID controllers, but\n\n494\n00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.520\nyou might add a RAID controller, cuz you\ncan certainly get better ones than what's\n\n495\n00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.560\nintegrated and\nyou might add network adapters.\n\n496\n00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.190\nThose are the two main things.\n\n497\n00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.950\nOr fiber channel network adapters for\nconnecting to SANS.\n\n498\n00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.980\nThat's the most common thing that I add to\na server that will pop into those slots.\n\n499\n00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.510\nAnd if it's fiber channel to a SAN,\n\n500\n00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.030\nyou obviously want the best\nperformance you can get out of it.\n\n501\n00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.570\nSo having PCIe is really\ngonna facilitate that.\n\n502\n00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.600\nBut just note there are different\nstandards for those slots.\n\n503\n00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:09.100\nAnd when you buy a server today, you wanna\nmake sure that it has at least one of\n\n504\n00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.740\nthose slots, cuz you never know\nwhen you might need to expand.\n\n505\n00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.492\nIt's not something you\ncan add after the fact.\n\n506\n00:25:13.492 --> 00:25:18.080\nIf you buy a server that has no slots,\nit's not like you can add more later.\n\n507\n00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.080\nAnd if you need more like\nthis one has two slots so\n\n508\n00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.539\nif I need more than two,\nI'd have to go to a bigger server.\n\n509\n00:25:22.539 --> 00:25:25.310\nOne that was to you or even for\nyou to have room for the extra cards.\n\n510\n00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.000\nThere's just no more room in here.\n\n511\n00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.540\nThere's room enough for two cards,\nthe RAID controller is eating one.\n\n512\n00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:31.982\nI can only add one more card and\n\n513\n00:25:31.982 --> 00:25:35.236\nthen there's just no more physical\nroom inside of this box for it.\n\n514\n00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:39.160\nAll right, I mentioned network cards.\n\n515\n00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.630\nNetwork cards are, by in large,\nintegrated into the system.\n\n516\n00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:45.770\nOn this particular system,\nit's got two right,\n\n517\n00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.950\nyeah, two network adapters right here.\n\n518\n00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.290\nAnd that's these silver boxes.\n\n519\n00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:52.980\nThey're usually located\nright by the USB Ports.\n\n520\n00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:57.080\nAnd so this one, the silver boxes, there's\na network jack in the top of each and\n\n521\n00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:00.190\nthen there's two USB ports underneath,\nwhich we can't see here.\n\n522\n00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:01.180\nBut they're right there.\n\n523\n00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.510\nIntel is probably the most\ncommon one that you'll find, and\n\n524\n00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.440\nBroadcom, which there's a weird\nrelationship between Intel and Broadcom.\n\n525\n00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.890\nA lot of people say that Intel\nmakes Broadcom's stuff, but\n\n526\n00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.270\nI don't know if that's true or not.\n\n527\n00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:16.270\nBut either way,\nyou'll find those integrated.\n\n528\n00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.200\nThose are probably fine for what you need.\n\n529\n00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.200\nBut maybe, maybe yours don't\nhave a TCP offload engine.\n\n530\n00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.920\nAnd so you want a TOE so\nyou add in your own card.\n\n531\n00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.340\nOr maybe two slots isn't enough.\n\n532\n00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:30.320\nMaybe this is a virtualization server and\nso you need a couple of cards for\n\n533\n00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.140\nlive migration, or V motion or whatever.\n\n534\n00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:39.600\nYou need a couple of cards for management,\nyou need a couple of cards for iSCSI.\n\n535\n00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.510\nSo if you want to add\nmore physical interfaces,\n\n536\n00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:44.000\nthe two that are on board\naren't gonna be enough.\n\n537\n00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.300\nAnd so then you can buy a card and\nstick it in.\n\n538\n00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.270\nAnd there's Intel cards that\nhave four ports on them, so\n\n539\n00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:50.020\nyou can drop it right in.\n\n540\n00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:54.570\nYou got four network adapters easy\nenough to add those in in the PCI slots.\n\n541\n00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.160\nOn the networking side most\nservers these days are gonna have\n\n542\n00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.550\ngigabit adapters\nintegrated into the board.\n\n543\n00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.440\nIf you want 10 gig or 40 gig you're\ngonna have to add cards for that.\n\n544\n00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:07.370\nSo that's another use of those PCI slots,\nto expand that out.\n\n545\n00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.950\nOtherwise, networking, it's usually\njust built in and we run with those.\n\n546\n00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.720\nSince we scale out these days instead of\nscaling up, we just add more servers.\n\n547\n00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.770\nUsually the two nicks that are built\nin are enough, cuz we'll team those,\n\n548\n00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:21.920\nbound them together, and that way if one\nlink fails we just use the other one and\n\n549\n00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:23.580\nwe're in business and that's that.\n\n550\n00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:26.660\nThe only place where I usually add\nthem is on a virtualization server,\n\n551\n00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:29.660\nthat's where I normally want at\nleast four on something like that.\n\n552\n00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.820\nLet's see, hard drives.\n\n553\n00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.570\nWe haven't really talked\nmuch about hard drives.\n\n554\n00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:38.220\nI think I pointed them out in this server\ncuz they were all the way up at the front.\n\n555\n00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:43.150\nBut hard drives are a lot different\nwhen it comes to servers as far as\n\n556\n00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:44.800\nany kind of standardization.\n\n557\n00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.770\nThese guys are all way\nup here in the front and\n\n558\n00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:52.710\nthey are able to be popped out via\nthese little handles up front.\n\n559\n00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:56.460\nSo you can come in here and\ngoodness that was in there tight.\n\n560\n00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.260\nThere we go.\n\n561\n00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.470\nSo you can pop them out to\ngain access to the drive.\n\n562\n00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:03.140\nThis one is using\ntraditional spinning disks.\n\n563\n00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.330\nA lot of servers are using\nSSDs these days.\n\n564\n00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:09.400\nIt's more expensive but\nyou get better performance out of it.\n\n565\n00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.670\nAs far as a spinning disk is concern,\nthis is a full size 3 1/2 half inch.\n\n566\n00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:17.030\nMany people if you switch to SaaS\ndrives the serial tasks iSCSI they\n\n567\n00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:21.250\nwere going to the smaller I was a two and\na half inch the laptop size hard drive so\n\n568\n00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:22.940\nthey're much smaller which means.\n\n569\n00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.830\nI can fit more drives on\nthere I can leave it for\n\n570\n00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.330\nhard drives in the server\ncuz their full size.\n\n571\n00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:31.620\nIf these are the smaller guys would\nprobably be able to fit eight and\n\n572\n00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.600\nonly take up this much space in an extra\nroom that's what you'll see in a lot of\n\n573\n00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:39.710\nthem were they're stuck one on top of each\nother and four bases, so you get A drives.\n\n574\n00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:43.590\nSo those take a lot less space,\nbut they are more expensive,\n\n575\n00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:44.720\nthey're expensive drives.\n\n576\n00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.570\nBut everything is expensive when\nit comes to a server I guess if\n\n577\n00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:48.650\nyou look at that way.\n\n578\n00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:50.690\nNow when you have a hard drive,\n\n579\n00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.140\na lot of times they'll have\na special slide attach to them.\n\n580\n00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.920\nIt is a standard hard drive.\n\n581\n00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.170\nBut this sled is designed\nto help them slide in and\n\n582\n00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.580\nstay stable inside of the unit.\n\n583\n00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:04.910\nAnd it has a little handle that\nlets you pop the drive out.\n\n584\n00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:08.670\nThis one has the purple coloring on it,\nwhich is what's letting me know that\n\n585\n00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:13.600\nit's hot swappable that I can pop this\none out while the server is online.\n\n586\n00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.210\nAnd they've actually written on here so\nthat I know what kind of drive it is.\n\n587\n00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:26.512\nThis one is a 7,200 RPM 3G or\n3 gigabyte drive, so it's SATA 3 gig.\n\n588\n00:29:26.512 --> 00:29:29.230\nSATA 6 gig is what you would get today, so\n\n589\n00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:31.870\nthis is actually a little slower\nthan what I might buy today.\n\n590\n00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:35.810\nAnd it's a SATA,\nright serial attached, no serial ATA.\n\n591\n00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:36.490\nWhatever ATA [CROSSTALK].\n\n592\n00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:38.460\n&gt;&gt; Advanced Technology Attachment.\n\n593\n00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:39.035\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Wes.\n\n594\n00:29:39.035 --> 00:29:40.750\n[LAUGH] Bailing me out this episode.\n\n595\n00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:42.350\nSo this one's SATA.\n\n596\n00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.950\nYou can also get iSCSI, right?\n\n597\n00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:47.780\nThe iSCSI ones are more expensive but\nthey're normally faster.\n\n598\n00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.480\nYou can get 15,000 RPM that are twice\nas fast spinning wise as these.\n\n599\n00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:55.740\nYou can get SSDs and so you'll see those\nand they'll be smaller and faster.\n\n600\n00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.790\nThey usually won't be two\nterabytes in size though,\n\n601\n00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:59.740\nthe SDD is usually a lot smaller.\n\n602\n00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:05.940\nBut those drives just pop right in and\nthey have a standard SATA connector or\n\n603\n00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.450\nwhatever it is that you're\nusing on the back end.\n\n604\n00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:11.560\nThis one just has the drives on the front,\nthat's really common.\n\n605\n00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.620\nThat's normally where you're gonna see it,\nbecause you have access to them.\n\n606\n00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:17.850\nHard drives fail more frequently than\nany other part inside of a server.\n\n607\n00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:21.340\nPower supplies, fans and hard drives,\n\n608\n00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.890\nthose are ones that you'll\nroutinely have to deal with.\n\n609\n00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:27.610\nAs long as your environment is cooled\nproperly, your fans won't normally fail.\n\n610\n00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:30.260\nAnd as long as you've got\nproper electrical conditioning,\n\n611\n00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.000\nyour power supplies won't normally fail.\n\n612\n00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.700\nBut if your taking surges, then power\nsupplies will fail but hard drives,\n\n613\n00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.440\nno matter what you do,\nthey'll fail eventually, right?\n\n614\n00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.900\nIf you get three years on a hard drive,\n\n615\n00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.790\nthat's the expected\nlifetime you can get on it.\n\n616\n00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:44.440\nAnd after that,\nit's a crapshoot how long it's gonna last.\n\n617\n00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.790\nWith server hard drives, when you power\non the server, they start spinning, and\n\n618\n00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:51.060\nthey stay spinning.\n\n619\n00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:55.400\nAnd they spin 24 hours a day\nthe entire time the server is on.\n\n620\n00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.150\nHard drives that do that,\nas far as spinning disks,\n\n621\n00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:01.550\nthe motors get conditioned to that speed,\nthat spin.\n\n622\n00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:04.830\nAnd if they run like that for years,\nand you power the server off and\n\n623\n00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:08.320\nthe drives stop,\nwhen you power them back on,\n\n624\n00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:13.210\nthe motor has to work extra hard to get\nthat disk spinning back up to speed again.\n\n625\n00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:14.480\nAnd a lot of times they can't do it.\n\n626\n00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.570\nThey've been running for years maintaining\na speed, not getting up to that speed.\n\n627\n00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:24.120\nAnd so when you power a server off that's\nold plan for a hard drive failing.\n\n628\n00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.500\nIt's almost a guarantee.\n\n629\n00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.060\nThe more drives you have the more of a\nguarantee it's gonna be that you're gonna\n\n630\n00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.290\nhave a hard drive fail.\n\n631\n00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:32.090\nSo that's where RAID arrays\nare really important.\n\n632\n00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:36.520\nWhen you have hard drives in a server\nthe majority of servers have an integrated\n\n633\n00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.190\nRAID controller on the motherboard.\n\n634\n00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:41.770\nAnd that RAID controller is usually\ncapable of doing RAID 0 and RAID 1.\n\n635\n00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:42.970\nRAID 1 being mirroring, right?\n\n636\n00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:46.139\nSo we can mirror our data if one drives\nfails, another's got a copy of it.\n\n637\n00:31:46.139 --> 00:31:49.091\nBut the integrated RAID controller\nis not normally very good.\n\n638\n00:31:49.091 --> 00:31:53.664\nIt's missing some of the features that\nwe're gonna talk about in other episodes,\n\n639\n00:31:53.664 --> 00:31:55.623\nbut But this server in particular,\n\n640\n00:31:55.623 --> 00:31:58.450\nyou can see we've added in\na RAID controller to it.\n\n641\n00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:01.490\nSo if it's got a RAID controller\nbuild into the motherboard,\n\n642\n00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:04.770\nwhy did we add one in?\n\n643\n00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:08.540\nWell, this RAID controller\nhas extra memory on it.\n\n644\n00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:12.133\nSo it's had increased RAM,\nwhich is its write cache.\n\n645\n00:32:12.133 --> 00:32:15.748\nSo when you write to your disks,\ninstead of writing to the disks,\n\n646\n00:32:15.748 --> 00:32:17.411\nit writes to the memory here.\n\n647\n00:32:17.411 --> 00:32:20.850\nAnd then it can write to\nthe disks on its own time.\n\n648\n00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:24.223\nAnd our operating system doesn't have\nto wait for it, that speeds up writes.\n\n649\n00:32:24.223 --> 00:32:28.003\nAnd then the other thing is if we lose\npower while there's writes in the memory\n\n650\n00:32:28.003 --> 00:32:29.700\nhere, then we lost those writes.\n\n651\n00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.380\nBut the operating system thought\nit was done and it wasn't.\n\n652\n00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.740\nSo underneath this car, there's a battery.\n\n653\n00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:38.000\nThis has batter backed write cache.\n\n654\n00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.993\nSo if we lose power, the writes that\nwere still in memory here are saved,\n\n655\n00:32:41.993 --> 00:32:43.241\nthey're preserved.\n\n656\n00:32:43.241 --> 00:32:46.373\nAnd when the system boots back up it will\nfinish writing to the hard drives, and\n\n657\n00:32:46.373 --> 00:32:47.690\nyou don't lose data.\n\n658\n00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:51.890\nWhen you add RAID controllers,\nthey're usually faster, better,\n\n659\n00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:56.530\nsupport more RAID standards and give you\nthings like battery back right cache\n\n660\n00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:59.000\ncontrollers, and that's really worth it.\n\n661\n00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.840\nRAID controllers get very, very expensive.\n\n662\n00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.930\nThey can be thousands of dollars to get\nlike one of the nicer HP smarter A cards\n\n663\n00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:11.060\nor some of the other Dell perk\ncontrollers that they have.\n\n664\n00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:16.659\nThose guys, each one it just comes with\na wealth of value inside of those.\n\n665\n00:33:16.659 --> 00:33:18.706\nSo be aware that you might\nneed to add a RAID controller,\n\n666\n00:33:18.706 --> 00:33:21.480\ndon't just assume the integrated\none's gonna be good enough.\n\n667\n00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:26.340\nThis one supports RAID 10,\nRAID 50, RAID 6, so it\n\n668\n00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:30.030\nhas extra RAID standards that aren't even\nsupported by the one on the motherboard.\n\n669\n00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:34.991\nSo another reason why I might wanna\nmove to an integrated RAID controller.\n\n670\n00:33:34.991 --> 00:33:40.322\nAll right, I think I've pretty much\ntalked about darn near every component.\n\n671\n00:33:40.322 --> 00:33:43.393\nOne thing, we haven't looked at that\nI know we're gonna look at in another\n\n672\n00:33:43.393 --> 00:33:44.510\nepisode is the BIOS side.\n\n673\n00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:47.110\nJust like any motherboard,\nthere's a little\n\n674\n00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:50.850\nbit of the system that has to kick in\nto get everything to turn on and work.\n\n675\n00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:53.368\nAnd in a server,\nit works just like a workstation.\n\n676\n00:33:53.368 --> 00:33:57.890\nThe BIOS, the Basic Input Output System,\nit's responsible for,\n\n677\n00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:00.920\nonce power's received by your system.\n\n678\n00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:04.836\nWaking up the CPU and recognizing it,\nwaking up the memory and recognizing it,\n\n679\n00:34:04.836 --> 00:34:06.362\ninitializing the video card.\n\n680\n00:34:06.362 --> 00:34:09.180\nAll the various things that happen\nwhen you press power on the computer.\n\n681\n00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:13.760\nThe biggest difference you're gonna see\non a server, is that on a work station,\n\n682\n00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.940\nthe BIOS is normally written by AMI,\nright?\n\n683\n00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:19.056\nAmerican Megatrends or Phoenix.\n\n684\n00:34:19.056 --> 00:34:21.551\nThere's a couple companies that make\nthe standard BIOS that just about\n\n685\n00:34:21.551 --> 00:34:22.590\neverybody uses.\n\n686\n00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:25.584\nOn a server, it's almost always\nwritten by the manufacturer.\n\n687\n00:34:25.584 --> 00:34:30.988\nSo it will be HPs own BIOS or\nDell's own BIOS, or whatever.\n\n688\n00:34:30.988 --> 00:34:34.090\nAnd that's because they've\ndesigned all this hardware.\n\n689\n00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:36.662\nThey're the one's who make it work\nthe way it's supposed to work.\n\n690\n00:34:36.662 --> 00:34:38.943\nSo you have that, it's part of the system,\n\n691\n00:34:38.943 --> 00:34:41.850\nit will be integrated into\nthe motherboard somewhere.\n\n692\n00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:43.628\nOn this one, it is actually labeled.\n\n693\n00:34:43.628 --> 00:34:45.786\nLet's see, if we can get that camera.\n\n694\n00:34:45.786 --> 00:34:48.976\nNot that we can do anything about it,\nbut if you look at this chip here it's\n\n695\n00:34:48.976 --> 00:34:52.227\nactually labeled BIOS, so I know that's\nthe BIOS chip right there for it.\n\n696\n00:34:52.227 --> 00:34:55.816\nAnd they'll release firmware updates and\nstuff that come out, so\n\n697\n00:34:55.816 --> 00:34:57.380\nyou can update that.\n\n698\n00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:02.081\nThis system actually has redundant BIOS,\nso if I ever do an upgrade to it I don't\n\n699\n00:35:02.081 --> 00:35:06.800\njust write straight to this chip where\na failure could cause the system to fail.\n\n700\n00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.370\nInstead, it's got two sections\nof memory inside of it.\n\n701\n00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:13.770\nSo I write to one of them, and\nI'm running from the other.\n\n702\n00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:15.850\nAnd if I screw up one,\nthe other one's still good.\n\n703\n00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:18.460\nI have redundant RAM, when we boot\nthis server up in another episode,\n\n704\n00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:22.180\nyou'll see where it mentions that during\nthe boot process, ao there's the BIOS.\n\n705\n00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:27.660\nAnd it has a CMOS chip, just like anything\nelse that copper, metal, what is it?\n\n706\n00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.847\n&gt;&gt; Complementary metal\noxide semiconductor.\n\n707\n00:35:29.847 --> 00:35:30.762\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well I screwed that one up.\n\n708\n00:35:30.762 --> 00:35:31.663\nAll right, but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n709\n00:35:31.663 --> 00:35:33.800\n&gt;&gt; It's got a CMOS where it's storing\n\n710\n00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.560\nthe settings for BIOS.\n\n711\n00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:38.370\nAnd so just like any workstation or\nwhatever,\n\n712\n00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:42.680\nwe can hunt around on the motherboard and\nfind a battery, right?\n\n713\n00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.394\nAnd sometimes,\n\n714\n00:35:43.394 --> 00:35:46.356\nthis one's gonna be really dark cuz\nthe CPU is casting a shadow on it.\n\n715\n00:35:46.356 --> 00:35:51.753\nBut sometimes the battery\nis a CR2032 watch battery,\n\n716\n00:35:51.753 --> 00:35:56.880\njust like you'd use in\na standard digital watch.\n\n717\n00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.720\nOther times, it might actually be a little\nrechargeable battery stuck on there cuz it\n\n718\n00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.170\ncharges itself while it runs.\n\n719\n00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.950\nIt's not always what happens\nI will tip the server, but\n\n720\n00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.290\nI would drop this hard drive, probably.\n\n721\n00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:08.360\nIf you can hold that West,\nI can tip this a little bit,\n\n722\n00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.568\nwe might be able to see that\nbattery better, there it is.\n\n723\n00:36:10.568 --> 00:36:13.680\nLittle Energizer CR2032 battery,\nseeing right there.\n\n724\n00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:18.551\nNow, the reason I point that battery out\nis those batteries have a three year\n\n725\n00:36:18.551 --> 00:36:19.321\nlifetime.\n\n726\n00:36:19.321 --> 00:36:21.019\nMost of them in the server\nhas a three year lifetime.\n\n727\n00:36:21.019 --> 00:36:23.959\nSo we might need to replace\nthat battery from time to time,\n\n728\n00:36:23.959 --> 00:36:25.587\nit's something to keep an eye.\n\n729\n00:36:25.587 --> 00:36:31.390\nIf you see your server is not consistently\nmaintaining your clock, you can do that.\n\n730\n00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:34.019\nThere's a lot of operating systems\nlike Red Hat Enterprise Linux,\n\n731\n00:36:34.019 --> 00:36:36.199\nwhere they've stop trusting\nthe clock on the servers.\n\n732\n00:36:36.199 --> 00:36:39.485\nAnd they use their own time\nsynchronization to be able to get\n\n733\n00:36:39.485 --> 00:36:40.280\naround that.\n\n734\n00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.296\nThat's getting to be more and\nmore common these days,\n\n735\n00:36:43.296 --> 00:36:47.310\nbut you do still need to check those\nbatteries as your servers get older.\n\n736\n00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:51.030\nAlso not to be confused here in\naddition to BIOS, you may have UEFI.\n\n737\n00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:53.970\nUEFI is kind of the,\nI wanna say replacement to BIOS.\n\n738\n00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:54.940\nIt doesn't actually replace it.\n\n739\n00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:58.548\nIt really just kind of-\n&gt;&gt; It's more efficient.\n\n740\n00:36:58.548 --> 00:37:00.658\n&gt;&gt; It extends the functionality of BIOS.\n\n741\n00:37:00.658 --> 00:37:03.084\nSo it more easily recognize\noperating systems and\n\n742\n00:37:03.084 --> 00:37:05.520\nonly run trusted operating\nsystems at boot time.\n\n743\n00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.877\nIt has Secure Boot, extra features.\n\n744\n00:37:07.877 --> 00:37:11.912\nSo most servers have implemented that,\nat least during these stage and\n\n745\n00:37:11.912 --> 00:37:13.200\nserver development.\n\n746\n00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.235\nSo when you press power, yeah, it's BIOS,\nit's actually turning the system on.\n\n747\n00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:20.573\nBut then it's handing over control to\nUEFI, and that's what's gonna find your\n\n748\n00:37:20.573 --> 00:37:23.810\noperating systems and actually turn\ncontrol of the hardware over to the OSs.\n\n749\n00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:26.840\nSo you may have UEFI support on yours,\n\n750\n00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.220\nwhich I actually have the acronym\nwritten down for this one.\n\n751\n00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.835\nIt's Unified Extensible\nFirmware Interface.\n\n752\n00:37:31.835 --> 00:37:34.769\nAnd that's common on workstations and\nservers these days,\n\n753\n00:37:34.769 --> 00:37:36.157\nthat's not a unique thing.\n\n754\n00:37:36.157 --> 00:37:37.230\n&gt;&gt; It was about time too.\n\n755\n00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:39.144\nI mean not that this is a history lesson.\n\n756\n00:37:39.144 --> 00:37:42.210\nBIOS goes back to I think,\nGary Kildall, he invented it in 76.\n\n757\n00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:45.936\nSo you can see we've had it around for\na while so it's time for a change.\n\n758\n00:37:45.936 --> 00:37:46.791\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\n\n759\n00:37:46.791 --> 00:37:50.408\nafter you have the rest of the components\nyou have in a server are fairly standard.\n\n760\n00:37:50.408 --> 00:37:54.760\nNow don't be surprised if you buy\na server right now in 2017, and\n\n761\n00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.870\nyou see some ancient ports on it.\n\n762\n00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:57.567\nLike PS2 ports,\n\n763\n00:37:57.567 --> 00:38:01.090\nWes was teasing me earlier, cuz there's\nPS2 ports in the back of the server.\n\n764\n00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:04.080\nMany servers still have PS2 ports,\nfor the keyboard and mouse.\n\n765\n00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:08.120\nAnd the reason is,\npeople invested in KVMs, right?\n\n766\n00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.510\nKVMs for sharing a monitor, keyboard,\nand mouse across their servers.\n\n767\n00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:14.821\nAnd if you have 200 servers\nall set up with PS2 KVMs,\n\n768\n00:38:14.821 --> 00:38:18.209\nthat's a lot of equipment to\nreplace to move over to USB.\n\n769\n00:38:18.209 --> 00:38:20.517\nSo most servers still have\nPS2 ports on them just so\n\n770\n00:38:20.517 --> 00:38:23.748\nwe don't have to change those KVMs out,\neventually that'll change.\n\n771\n00:38:23.748 --> 00:38:27.830\nBut you typically have USB ports on\nthe back and on the front of the server.\n\n772\n00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:29.640\nOn the front, so\nif you're standing in front of a rack,\n\n773\n00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.270\nyou can plug a keyboard and\na mouse right into the server and\n\n774\n00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:34.160\nwork with it right from there,\nif you don't have a KVM.\n\n775\n00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.950\nSo you have different options that you\nmay or may not have on your server,\n\n776\n00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:40.324\nthe particular brand or\nmodel that you pick.\n\n777\n00:38:40.324 --> 00:38:41.985\nSo there's a lot of variation.\n\n778\n00:38:41.985 --> 00:38:45.648\n&gt;&gt; And even though I was picking on\nDonnie, the PS2 boards tend to be a little\n\n779\n00:38:45.648 --> 00:38:49.628\nmore reliant cuz you don't need things\nlike USB emulation and stuff like that.\n\n780\n00:38:49.628 --> 00:38:54.387\nSo you gotta wire,\nthat once you push power, it turns on.\n\n781\n00:38:54.387 --> 00:38:55.854\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and that makes life a lot easier.\n\n782\n00:38:55.854 --> 00:38:59.430\nAll right, well Wes at this point,\nI think we pretty exhaustively covered\n\n783\n00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:02.007\nall the different components\ninside of this server.\n\n784\n00:39:02.007 --> 00:39:04.817\nI'm now faced with the chore of\nputting it all back together which\n\n785\n00:39:04.817 --> 00:39:05.951\nwe'll do after the show.\n\n786\n00:39:05.951 --> 00:39:09.274\nBut we did a pretty good\nrun down there on the cpu,\n\n787\n00:39:09.274 --> 00:39:12.042\nmemory, hard drives, network, PCI.\n\n788\n00:39:12.042 --> 00:39:14.740\nAll the different components\nyou guys have to worry about.\n\n789\n00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.325\nBy and large,\nit's just like a workstation,\n\n790\n00:39:16.325 --> 00:39:18.736\nit's just arranged a lot different and\na heck of a lot more expensive.\n\n791\n00:39:18.736 --> 00:39:22.986\nBecause it's higher quality and\nbuilt to a more stringent quality level.\n\n792\n00:39:22.986 --> 00:39:26.603\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, that's a lot of great\ninformation and I don't have to tell you\n\n793\n00:39:26.603 --> 00:39:29.880\nguys as you know we are coming to\nthe end of another great episode.\n\n794\n00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:33.395\nBut before we do, Don, do you have any\nadditional words that you might like to\n\n795\n00:39:33.395 --> 00:39:36.372\nthrow out about our server components,\nabout all the plethora,\n\n796\n00:39:36.372 --> 00:39:38.884\nif you will,\nof components that we've talked about.\n\n797\n00:39:38.884 --> 00:39:41.180\n&gt;&gt; Not too much, always remember safety.\n\n798\n00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.223\nServers are heavy, servers of sharp.\n\n799\n00:39:43.223 --> 00:39:46.579\nA lot of these middle ages in here are not\nfiled often, so they're kinda dangerous\n\n800\n00:39:46.579 --> 00:39:50.420\nbecause they're just made to be throwing\nthe rack and never touched again, right?\n\n801\n00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:53.636\nSo be careful when you work with them.\n\n802\n00:39:53.636 --> 00:39:57.330\nAnd then the other thing is\ndon't forget maintenance.\n\n803\n00:39:57.330 --> 00:40:01.460\nServers build up dust inside of them,\nthey have components that can fail,\n\n804\n00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:02.913\nyou need to monitor them.\n\n805\n00:40:02.913 --> 00:40:05.614\nThey have a lot of great reporting\ninformation that 's built right into\n\n806\n00:40:05.614 --> 00:40:06.310\nthe systems.\n\n807\n00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:09.129\nYou need to check your vendor\ndocumentation to learn what all your\n\n808\n00:40:09.129 --> 00:40:09.802\nserver can do.\n\n809\n00:40:09.802 --> 00:40:11.782\nAnd take advantage of the features,\nyou paid for it, so\n\n810\n00:40:11.782 --> 00:40:13.940\nyou might as well get all\nthe benefits you can.\n\n811\n00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.516\n&gt;&gt; Well Don,\nthat's a lot of great information.\n\n812\n00:40:15.516 --> 00:40:18.030\nAs always, we appreciate you\nbeing in the studio with us.\n\n813\n00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:19.594\nWe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n814\n00:40:19.594 --> 00:40:21.675\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign out here at ITPro.TV.\n\n815\n00:40:21.675 --> 00:40:23.580\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n816\n00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.222\n&gt;&gt; I'm Don.\n\n817\n00:40:24.222 --> 00:40:25.141\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n818\n00:40:25.141 --> 00:40:26.091\n&gt;&gt; Time.\n\n819\n00:40:26.091 -->

00:00:12.053\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:16.425\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode here\nat ITProTV, I'm your host Wes Bryan,\n\n5\n00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:21.339\nand in today's episode we are continuing\nthrough our CompTIA Server+ certification\n\n6\n00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.331\ncourse, and today well we've got\nkind of a shocking episode for you.\n\n7\n00:00:25.331 --> 00:00:28.460\nBut before the puns get any worse,\nnone other than Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.430\nHow you doing, Don?\n\n9\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.991\n&gt;&gt; I don't think the puns\ncan get any worse,\n\n10\n00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:32.991\nI think we really reached rock bottom\nat the beginning of the episode,\n\n11\n00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:36.245\nwhich means it can only get\nbetter from here, so [LAUGH].\n\n12\n00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:39.170\nI'm ready to jump back\ninto the world of Server+,\n\n13\n00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.440\nand in this episode we're going\nto be talking about power.\n\n14\n00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.910\nPower is really important,\nespecially when it comes to servers, and\n\n15\n00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.060\nnetwork equipment, and data centers, and\n\n16\n00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.490\nin all of the different gear that\nwe've got, that we put in place.\n\n17\n00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.750\nIt is really a challenging concept for\npeople.\n\n18\n00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.370\nIf you've been working in data centres for\nyears and years and\n\n19\n00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.520\nyou already understand this, but if\nyou're coming from the consumer realm or\n\n20\n00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.820\neven a small office,\neven a medium business in a lot of cases.\n\n21\n00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.190\nYou're really just used\nto one kind of power, but\n\n22\n00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.420\nwhen you get into a data center and when\nyou start working with server equipment,\n\n23\n00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.060\nthere's actually several\ndifferent kinds of power.\n\n24\n00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.680\nI can think of five different kinds\noffhand that you can expect to find in\n\n25\n00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.330\njust about any data\ncenter that's out there.\n\n26\n00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.660\nThen let's throw on the international\nmix onto this, right?\n\n27\n00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.150\nWhen you start getting\ninto other countries,\n\n28\n00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.700\na lot of our viewers are out\nthere in Australia or\n\n29\n00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.590\nJapan or somewhere like that, and\nyour power is different, right?\n\n30\n00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.030\nIt varies from location to location, and\nso when it comes to working with server\n\n31\n00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.000\nequipment, we've got a lot of\nchoices when it comes to power.\n\n32\n00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.890\nHow do we make the right choice, or how do\nwe even support what we've already got,\n\n33\n00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.590\nbecause there's so many different types?.\n\n34\n00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.260\nSo, in this episode, what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna take a look at some of\n\n35\n00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.130\nthe different types of\npower that are available.\n\n36\n00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.210\nWhat the difference is,\nand why they even matter,\n\n37\n00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.300\nand then we'll take a look at a few\nexamples of how that's implemented.\n\n38\n00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.660\nThen, for whatever reason, CompTIA lumped\nin water cooling into this objective, so\n\n39\n00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.520\nwe'll tackle water cooling\ntowards the end of it, too.\n\n40\n00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.290\nWhich is why I've got this crazy computer\nsitting on the desk here, next to us, and\n\n41\n00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.390\nwe'll talk about it there.\n\n42\n00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.090\nI know why they brought it in because\nthe mainframes usually get water cooled.\n\n43\n00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.500\nThe main frames show a weird power, so\n\n44\n00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.060\nit all, when it comes together but\nlet's start power.\n\n45\n00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.600\nNow every computer needs\npower it's a given.\n\n46\n00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.952\nIf you have a laptop maybe uses a battery\nbut otherwise it's gonna plug into a wall\n\n47\n00:02:17.952 --> 00:02:21.225\na desktop always gonna plug in\ninto the wall, we need power.\n\n48\n00:02:21.225 --> 00:02:24.999\nUsually you just take your computer, and\nyou take the power cable it came with and\n\n49\n00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:26.845\nyou plug it on the wall, and off you go.\n\n50\n00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:32.198\nIf you're here in the United States,\nthat power cable probably looks Something\n\n51\n00:02:32.198 --> 00:02:37.236\nlike this, and US power cables are three\nprong, right, in other countries\n\n52\n00:02:37.236 --> 00:02:42.610\nyou might have two prong cables or\nfour prong, there's different variations.\n\n53\n00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.430\nThis one's also very small, if you look\nit's got two blades in one post, that's\n\n54\n00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.820\nwhat makes up our power cable connections\nhere in the US, for most connections.\n\n55\n00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.740\nBut in other countries,\nit might be a round circle or\n\n56\n00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.520\nsome other variant of that.\n\n57\n00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.300\nSome are larger.\n\n58\n00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.010\nSome are smaller.\n\n59\n00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.880\nIf you look at things like the power\nplug on am electric clothes dryer\n\n60\n00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.360\nis gonna be a pretty large connection or\nan electric oven.\n\n61\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.890\nAnd that's because they're designed\nto carry more power, right?\n\n62\n00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.180\nMore power usually\nresults in a bigger plug.\n\n63\n00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.030\nAnd there's a few reasons for that.\n\n64\n00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.080\nNow on the other end though we see what\ngonna be plug in to our sever power\n\n65\n00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.140\nsupply or computer power supply and\nthis is usually not changed.\n\n66\n00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.870\nThat on a regular PC or in a high Highest\nend of servers, you typically see\n\n67\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.210\nthis power plug, even in other countries,\nbecause you're cable has two ends, right?\n\n68\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.610\nSo we can have one end that's\nlocalized for your country.\n\n69\n00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.420\nAnd then the other end is a standard\nwhat most people refer to as a D plug.\n\n70\n00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.340\nAnd the D plug is actually\na female power connector\n\n71\n00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.720\nthat is designed to go into\nthe back of a power supply.\n\n72\n00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.290\nSo when I wave around a server\npower supply like this one,\n\n73\n00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.140\nIt's got a standard d\nplug right there on it.\n\n74\n00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.390\nAnd by having a standard plug like that,\nthey can sell this power adapter in more\n\n75\n00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.400\nthan one country and\nknow that it's gonna work.\n\n76\n00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.020\nAnd all they have to do is package\ndifferent power cable, right.\n\n77\n00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.320\nSo we usually don't have\nto worry about it too much.\n\n78\n00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.670\nYou buy the stuff, you take it\nout of the box, and there it is.\n\n79\n00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.770\nYou plug it in and off you go.\n\n80\n00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.440\nWhere it gets challenging though,\nis the actual wall socket.\n\n81\n00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.730\nThat, when you look at a wall socket,\n\n82\n00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.340\nhere in the United States most of\nour wall sockets are 120 watts.\n\n83\n00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.010\nSo if I have a 120 watt outlet,\nor I'm sorry 120 volt,\n\n84\n00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.920\nI gotta get my terminology right.\n\n85\n00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.940\nSo If I have a 120 volt outlet, well.\n\n86\n00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.860\nThat's what we use here, it's kinda what\nwe're used to but sometimes you have 240.\n\n87\n00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.180\nAnd if you go into Europe or most of\nAsia you have 240 darn near everywhere.\n\n88\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.450\nAnd then you go into some data centers and\nthey'll warn you,\n\n89\n00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.120\nthey'll be like all of\nour outlets are 208.\n\n90\n00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.440\nAnd now you get really confused because\n208, 240, 120, what are all these number?\n\n91\n00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.600\nWell, it all comes down to how power cross\nis the line then, I'm not an electrician,\n\n92\n00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.530\nI have no aspirations,\n\n93\n00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.000\nI have been shocked many many times\nwhich explains many many things.\n\n94\n00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.580\nBut, we do need to be at least\nan amateur electrician when it comes to\n\n95\n00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.950\nunderstanding our server power.\n\n96\n00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.610\nNow, that doesn't mean we're\nworking with live wires and\n\n97\n00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.110\nsplicing things that has bad.\n\n98\n00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.720\nWe don't want to do that.\n\n99\n00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.510\nYou do want to call an actual register\nelectrician to come and do that.\n\n100\n00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.660\nBut we are gonna have to make sure\nwe have the right power cable.\n\n101\n00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.200\nAnd we have to make sure that we can talk\nto the electrician and that I can say hey,\n\n102\n00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.270\nI'm actually gonna be installing\na Cisco Catalyst 6500 switch.\n\n103\n00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:30.510\nAnd I need 4 240 volt outlets,\nand I need 20 amps on each.\n\n104\n00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.180\nAnd I need to be able to say that, so the\nelectrician puts the right outlets, in.\n\n105\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.890\nAnd when I put my equipment in,\nit gets the right connection.\n\n106\n00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.230\nAnd when they say, okay,\nwell what kind of plug do you use?\n\n107\n00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.860\nAnd I can say, well I need a NEMA 15,\nor NEMA 5-15, or a NEMA 5-20.\n\n108\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.780\nI know those numbers.\n\n109\n00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.880\nAnd I can tell them, and I make sure I get\nthe right stuff Otherwise, you end up in\n\n110\n00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.470\na situation where you unpack this brand\nnew server, you're ready to plug it in and\n\n111\n00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.680\ngo, and the plug won't fit in\nthe outlet or you plug the cable in and\n\n112\n00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.000\nit's not getting enough power and\nthe system keeps rebooting or locking up.\n\n113\n00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.130\nYou run into problems cuz you couldn't\nproperly relay the specifications.\n\n114\n00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.290\nNow Don you've thrown out\na couple terms there, right?\n\n115\n00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.270\nWhat do we have thrown out?\n\n116\n00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.340\nDo you have watts, you've talked about\nvoltage now, and you talked about amps.\n\n117\n00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.650\nIf I'm that person that's\nmaking that phone call and\n\n118\n00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.340\nI have to relay this information, I'm\ngonna have to do my homework beforehand so\n\n119\n00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.820\nI know what information to relay.\n\n120\n00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.890\nHow can I go about that?\n\n121\n00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.190\nHow can I establish or formulate, if you\nwill, to figure that information out so\n\n122\n00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.530\nthat I know that I'm relaying\nthe right information?\n\n123\n00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.290\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nlet's run through the basics.\n\n124\n00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.610\nAnd again, we're not gonna be\nelectricians by the end of this episode.\n\n125\n00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.570\nThat's a fact.\n\n126\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.740\nYou will shock and probably kill yourself.\n\n127\n00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.860\nAlthough I've been shocked many times,\nand I haven't been killed yet.\n\n128\n00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.920\nBut there's always a chance.\n\n129\n00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.440\nSo we want to play it safe,\nthat we do trust our electricians.\n\n130\n00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.530\nThey're professionals.\n\n131\n00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.100\nThey are paid to take that risk so\nwe don't have to.\n\n132\n00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.980\nBut there's a few basic terms and\nconcepts that we need to understand.\n\n133\n00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.910\nSo, let's start with power itself.\n\n134\n00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.660\nThe reality is, power is power,\nelectricity is electricity,\n\n135\n00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.160\nit's all the same, but the way that it's\npresented to us can be done differently.\n\n136\n00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.870\nSo for example, we have terms like AC and\nDC, which most of you guys are familiar\n\n137\n00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.070\nwith, I'm sure AC is alternating\ncurrent and DC is direct current.\n\n138\n00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.910\nDirect current is what\nyou pull from a battery.\n\n139\n00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:12.920\nWhen you have a battery and\n\n140\n00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.670\nyou connect to it, it starts providing\nthe direct current on the line.\n\n141\n00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.080\nYou're receiving that power and\n\n142\n00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.210\nit's consistent, but\nalternating current is different.\n\n143\n00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.530\nWhen you plug into a wall socket,\nyou're getting alternating current, and\n\n144\n00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.210\nthe way it works is on a sign wave.\n\n145\n00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:32.190\nSign waves, they go up and down, up and\ndown, across a horizontal axis, and.\n\n146\n00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:37.470\nWhen they're above the axis, they're\nproviding a positive level of power,\n\n147\n00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.920\nand then when they drop below the axis,\nnow they're providing a negative amount.\n\n148\n00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.016\nSo when I have something like\na 120 outlet on the wall,\n\n149\n00:07:47.016 --> 00:07:51.593\nand I plug into it,\nI'm getting as much as 120.\n\n150\n00:07:51.593 --> 00:07:56.405\nOver sixty second intervals it does this\nweird intervals, and it will drop off and\n\n151\n00:07:56.405 --> 00:08:00.660\ncome back up, and so it's constantly\nalternating between positive and\n\n152\n00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.701\nnegative does it gives that to me.\n\n153\n00:08:02.701 --> 00:08:07.225\nMy system must be ready to receive that,\nbecause there's a little window of time\n\n154\n00:08:07.225 --> 00:08:10.790\nwhen we reach the axis where\nit's providing nothing.\n\n155\n00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.550\nIt's not providing any current at all.\n\n156\n00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.463\nAnd so when that happens,\nyour system has to be prepared for it.\n\n157\n00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:17.487\nThat's why we have capacitors.\n\n158\n00:08:17.487 --> 00:08:20.038\nThere's capacitors on\nthe motherboard that store power, so\n\n159\n00:08:20.038 --> 00:08:23.030\nthat as you reach that zero point\nyou're running off the capacitor, and\n\n160\n00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.204\nthen it drops down and\nyou're getting power again.\n\n161\n00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:27.439\nSo it's alternating on,\noff, on, off, on, off.\n\n162\n00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:29.114\nThat's a lot different than a battery.\n\n163\n00:08:29.114 --> 00:08:31.250\nSo that alternating current,\n\n164\n00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:35.365\nthe sine wave can provide quite\na bit of power if it needs to.\n\n165\n00:08:35.365 --> 00:08:39.288\nAnd when we have a 120, or\na 240, or something like that,\n\n166\n00:08:39.288 --> 00:08:41.701\nthose are different amounts of power.\n\n167\n00:08:41.701 --> 00:08:43.940\nThe power is being presented\nto us different ways.\n\n168\n00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:49.360\nNow in the computing world, especially\nwith servers, what you’re going to have\n\n169\n00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.770\nare power supplies, and the power supplies\nare gonna receive alternating current.\n\n170\n00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.770\nAnd then typically what they’re doing,\nis converting it\n\n171\n00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.840\ninto direct current that they're\nthen providing onto the motherboard.\n\n172\n00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.100\nThey don’t have to, but\nmost systems do that.\n\n173\n00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.130\nSo that’s why we have to\nhave these power supplies.\n\n174\n00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.160\nThat’s why you can’t just plug right\ninto the motherboard with the wall\n\n175\n00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.180\nsocket and off you go.\n\n176\n00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.549\nThe motherboard is expecting\na different level of voltage.\n\n177\n00:09:12.549 --> 00:09:15.002\nNow voltage gets really\ntricky inside of a computer,\n\n178\n00:09:15.002 --> 00:09:17.957\nbecause there are several\ndifferent voltages that we'll see.\n\n179\n00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:24.720\nWe'll see 5 volt, and 12 volt, and\n48 volt, and you won't see 120 volt.\n\n180\n00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.110\nSo this power supply is taking that\nincoming power and stepping it down,\n\n181\n00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.250\ndividing it up, providing it out\nin these different levels so\n\n182\n00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.730\nthat each of the components can\nreceive the power that they want.\n\n183\n00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.500\nThe power that they're expecting to get,\nand not too much.\n\n184\n00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.300\nBecause if you get too much, what happens?\n\n185\n00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.230\nA fire, usually,\nthat's usually what happens.\n\n186\n00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.519\nAnd let's talk about that, right?\n\n187\n00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.030\nHow do we get fire?\n\n188\n00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.100\nWell, when you talk about\nelectrical devices,\n\n189\n00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.690\nyou'll see a lot of people\ntalk about efficiency, right?\n\n190\n00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.170\nWhen you go to buy a hot water heater,\nor an air conditioner, or\n\n191\n00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.210\na refrigerator, there's usually\na sticker on it that tells you\n\n192\n00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.480\nthe power efficiency of that unit, right?\n\n193\n00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.730\nWhich means it's gonna receive\na certain amount of power, and\n\n194\n00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.430\nthen it's gonna do something with it.\n\n195\n00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:10.730\nAnd the more efficient the device is,\nthe more it can get done with that power.\n\n196\n00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.220\nThe less efficient a device is,\nthe less it gets done, but\n\n197\n00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.510\nit's getting the same power.\n\n198\n00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.200\nSo how can two devices\nfunction differently if\n\n199\n00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.650\nthey're getting the same power?\n\n200\n00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:24.430\nWell, inefficient devices lose\nthat power in the form of heat.\n\n201\n00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:25.740\nThe heat pours out.\n\n202\n00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.410\nAnytime you have a device that's hot,\nthat's wasted energy.\n\n203\n00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.930\nSo CPUs, modern CPUs are very inefficient.\n\n204\n00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:36.290\nWhen you take a processor and\nit really gets going, it gets really hot.\n\n205\n00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.920\nWell, that's electric energy\nbeing dispersed as heat, and\n\n206\n00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.920\nthat's being wasted.\n\n207\n00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.970\nWe're wasting that energy.\n\n208\n00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.210\nIt was energy potential\nthat didn't get used.\n\n209\n00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.239\nRemember back in the day,\nthe 386 processors and 286s,\n\n210\n00:10:47.239 --> 00:10:51.257\nwe didn't even need heat sinks on those\nthings, they did just fine by themselves.\n\n211\n00:10:51.257 --> 00:10:54.244\nThey were far more efficient,\nbut they were way bigger, right?\n\n212\n00:10:54.244 --> 00:10:57.406\nWhen you start packing those\ntransistors in as small, and small, and\n\n213\n00:10:57.406 --> 00:11:01.590\nsmall as you can, they become inefficient,\nand that's just the nature of the beast.\n\n214\n00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:05.710\nAnd they get better and better over time,\nbut now we've got it where cooling is kind\n\n215\n00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.818\nof a necessity in a central part\nof any solution that we have.\n\n216\n00:11:08.818 --> 00:11:13.740\nSo that heat,\nthat's where we can cause a fire.\n\n217\n00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.610\nIf that heat gets too be too big,\nif we're wasting too much power and\n\n218\n00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.130\nwe're not able to communicate it.\n\n219\n00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:23.440\nAnd that's why you'll see things like\nthis network cord, or power cable.\n\n220\n00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.270\nThis power cable,\n\n221\n00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.190\nI actually got several people angry at me\nin the building because I've been stealing\n\n222\n00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.730\ncables from all over the place, but this\nis a power cable I took off a workstation.\n\n223\n00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.190\nIf you were to buy a desktop or a laptop,\n\n224\n00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.150\nit will probably have\na power cable like this.\n\n225\n00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:39.470\nAnd it's got the three-prong on one end,\nand it's got the D plug on the other, and\n\n226\n00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:40.791\nit's very, very thin.\n\n227\n00:11:40.791 --> 00:11:44.013\nI don't know, maybe if we go to the sky\ncam you can see it better, whatever.\n\n228\n00:11:44.013 --> 00:11:48.750\nThis is an incredibly thin little cable,\nthere's just not much to it, right?\n\n229\n00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:53.420\nIt's got the three wires,\nthe neutral, the ground, and\n\n230\n00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:58.360\nthe hot line all side by side to make for\njust a really thin cable, right?\n\n231\n00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.670\nThere's not much to it.\n\n232\n00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.950\nWell, I've got another cable here\n\n233\n00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.530\nthat came off of some of\nour lighting gear, okay?\n\n234\n00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.790\nAnd if you look at this cable,\nI've got a three-prong, and\n\n235\n00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.140\nI've got a D plug, right,\njust like the other one.\n\n236\n00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.240\nBut look how thick this cable is,\nit's ridiculous!\n\n237\n00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.750\nI mean, this is insanely thick.\n\n238\n00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.170\nWhy is that?\n\n239\n00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:22.190\nWell, when you buy power cables\nlike these, they have a gauge.\n\n240\n00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.910\nGauge is abbreviated A-W-G for\nsome reason, I'm sure there's some Greek,\n\n241\n00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.560\nor Latin, Roman thing for that.\n\n242\n00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:33.230\nBut gauge is the thickness of\nthe copper wire inside of that cable.\n\n243\n00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.938\nAnd the thicker that copper is,\n\n244\n00:12:35.938 --> 00:12:40.930\nthe more amperage, the more power or\ncurrent it can carry.\n\n245\n00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:44.350\nThe thinner it is,\nthe less current it can carry.\n\n246\n00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:45.340\nBecause if it's thin and\n\n247\n00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:49.550\nwe put too much current on it,\nthe extra current starts escaping as heat.\n\n248\n00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:53.600\nAnd the heat melts the shielding, and\nthen the shielding catches on fire.\n\n249\n00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.778\nAnd so that's why we've gotta be careful\nwhen we set up systems like these.\n\n250\n00:12:57.778 --> 00:13:00.574\nThat if we've got a high\nvoltage outlet and\n\n251\n00:13:00.574 --> 00:13:05.789\nwe plug in some really low gauge wire on\nit, that becomes a fire hazard, right?\n\n252\n00:13:05.789 --> 00:13:07.133\nAnd you've got to be careful with that.\n\n253\n00:13:07.133 --> 00:13:10.169\nNow, why do I care about this?\n\n254\n00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.811\nI care because there's a few different\nthings that have happened out there in\n\n255\n00:13:14.811 --> 00:13:16.840\nthe world when it comes to power.\n\n256\n00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.690\nIn the United States,\nwhen our country built out the power grid,\n\n257\n00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:25.745\nwe had a lot of government participation,\nright, and the government got behind it.\n\n258\n00:13:25.745 --> 00:13:30.102\nWe had two competing standards,\nthere's a whole story about Edison and\n\n259\n00:13:30.102 --> 00:13:31.254\nwhat's his name?\n\n260\n00:13:31.254 --> 00:13:31.909\n&gt;&gt; Tesla.\n\n261\n00:13:31.909 --> 00:13:33.754\n&gt;&gt; Tesla, and the different power.\n\n262\n00:13:33.754 --> 00:13:36.772\nAnd I don't wanna get into\nall the history of that, but\n\n263\n00:13:36.772 --> 00:13:41.300\nbasically what it boiled down to was that\nour country did a financial investment to\n\n264\n00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.570\nput in thicker copper cabling.\n\n265\n00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:49.520\nAnd so we could handle 120,\nlower voltage on our lines.\n\n266\n00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.450\nOther countries didn't have\nthat financial investment, and\n\n267\n00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.820\nthey slowly deploy their\nelectrical environment.\n\n268\n00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:59.672\nAnd so they needed to deploy thinner\ncopper, right, cuz copper is expensive.\n\n269\n00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:02.190\nThick copper, it cost a lot.\n\n270\n00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:03.730\nIf you go thinner copper\nyou're gonna save money.\n\n271\n00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:08.000\nAnd so they would go thinner copper, and\nit couldn't handle the same voltages, or\n\n272\n00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.130\nthe same amount of current, and so\nthey had to go to a higher voltage.\n\n273\n00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.630\nNow what am I talking about there?\n\n274\n00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.490\nI'm saying these other countries have\na higher voltage but thinner wire, and\n\n275\n00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.470\nthat's where this gets confusing.\n\n276\n00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.470\nVoltage is a really weird thing.\n\n277\n00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:21.370\nWhen you look at a line,\n\n278\n00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.930\nlike a power line,\nyou have what's called the wattage, right?\n\n279\n00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.520\nAnd normally when we look at a light bulb,\n\n280\n00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.370\nyou have a 40 watt light bulb or\na 60 watt light bulb.\n\n281\n00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.460\nWhen you look at a power supply,\nyou might have a 500 watt power supply,\n\n282\n00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.350\nor let's see what this one is.\n\n283\n00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:39.090\nIt's usually written on here somewhere,\nwhat the wattage is for these things.\n\n284\n00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:40.490\nAnd actually I'm not seeing it.\n\n285\n00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.830\nI'm sure it's on here,\nthere's a million things, here we go.\n\n286\n00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.770\nMax total continuous output power\nshall not exceed 400 watts.\n\n287\n00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.530\nSo, this is a 400 watt power supply.\n\n288\n00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.910\nNow, what is wattage?\n\n289\n00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:57.520\nWell, wattage is a calculation\nthat combines voltage and\n\n290\n00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.720\namperage, or voltage and current.\n\n291\n00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.880\nAnd these terms get confusing cuz\nthey're somewhat interchangeable.\n\n292\n00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.230\nSo let me show you a little slide\nthat I made that tries to explain it.\n\n293\n00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.020\nThe formula works out like this.\n\n294\n00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:12.740\nThe power on your line is a combination,\nit's voltage times current.\n\n295\n00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.790\nSo whatever your voltage is,\ntimes the current.\n\n296\n00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.130\nNow each of these has\na different unit of measure.\n\n297\n00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:21.900\nPower is measured in watts,\nvoltage is measured in volts, and\n\n298\n00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.460\ncurrent is measured in amps.\n\n299\n00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:28.260\nCurrent is sometimes called amperage,\nbut amps is the unit of measure.\n\n300\n00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.080\nSo when we're looking at this you'll\nhear me mix the terms up sometimes,\n\n301\n00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.530\nbut instead of saying current,\nI might say amps.\n\n302\n00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.270\nOr instead of amps, I might say current.\n\n303\n00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:41.082\nTechnically, amps is the unit of measure,\nnot what you're actually measuring, right?\n\n304\n00:15:41.082 --> 00:15:46.597\nIf my foot is 12 inches long,\nI don't call my foot an inch, right?\n\n305\n00:15:46.597 --> 00:15:49.548\nIt's my foot that I'm measuring, and\nthe inch is the unit of measure.\n\n306\n00:15:49.548 --> 00:15:54.870\nBut we consolate our current amps,\npeople just do it, but it's not the same.\n\n307\n00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.037\nThe current is what we're measuring,\namps is how we measure it.\n\n308\n00:15:57.037 --> 00:15:59.539\nVoltage and volts,\nthat's what makes it even more confusing,\n\n309\n00:15:59.539 --> 00:16:01.268\nbecause those are basically the same name.\n\n310\n00:16:01.268 --> 00:16:03.406\nAnd then power is measure in watts.\n\n311\n00:16:03.406 --> 00:16:05.002\nNow the wattage that I need.\n\n312\n00:16:05.002 --> 00:16:09.291\nThis power supply is a 400\nwatt power supply, so\n\n313\n00:16:09.291 --> 00:16:13.500\nwhat volts and\nwhat amps do I need to get to 400?\n\n314\n00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.168\nI can pick,right.\n\n315\n00:16:16.168 --> 00:16:21.159\nI might have one volt, and 400 amps.\n\n316\n00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:22.164\nThat's not going to happen, right?\n\n317\n00:16:22.164 --> 00:16:23.640\nThat would be a super hot line.\n\n318\n00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.510\nBut that would work.\n\n319\n00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.700\nI might have 400 volts, and 1 amp.\n\n320\n00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.250\nEither way,\nthat would work out to 400 watts,\n\n321\n00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.090\nand this power supply would be happy.\n\n322\n00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:35.680\nSo this power supply doesn't care how many\namps it gets, or how many volts it gets,\n\n323\n00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.100\nas long as it works out to\nbecome 400 watts, right.\n\n324\n00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.240\nThat's what it wants.\n\n325\n00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.800\nNow, that's not entirely true, that we do\nhave a minimum amperage that we have to\n\n326\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.140\nget, and that'll be written\non the power supply too.\n\n327\n00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.750\nBut, the way it works on a line,\n\n328\n00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:54.780\nis that you can decrease your\namperage by increasing your voltage,\n\n329\n00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.390\nthe higher the voltage gets,\nthe lower your amperage needs to be.\n\n330\n00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:05.630\nSo on a 120 volt line,\nI need a higher amperage to get 400 watts.\n\n331\n00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:11.445\nBut on a 240 volt line,\nI need a lower amperage to get 400 watts.\n\n332\n00:17:11.445 --> 00:17:15.785\nThat lower amperage means I\ncan use thinner copper, and\n\n333\n00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:19.815\nthen that means my cost of implementing\nthe infrastructure becomes cheaper.\n\n334\n00:17:19.815 --> 00:17:24.525\nSo in most countries, the US is kind\nof an exception, in most countries,\n\n335\n00:17:24.525 --> 00:17:29.445\nyou have 240 volt outlets on your wall,\nright?\n\n336\n00:17:29.445 --> 00:17:34.085\n240 volt, so that it can provide\nmore amperage over the same line,\n\n337\n00:17:34.085 --> 00:17:38.900\nover that thinner wire, than having to\ngo to thicker wire like we've done.\n\n338\n00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.430\nNow, if you have thicker wire, you can\npush even more amperage over it, or\n\n339\n00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:42.780\nyou can get even higher stuff.\n\n340\n00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:47.600\nSo those two cables that I held up,\nthe thin cable can only carry so\n\n341\n00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.945\nmuch amperage before it\nruns out of voltage.\n\n342\n00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:54.101\nOn the other hand the thicker\ncable that I held up,\n\n343\n00:17:54.101 --> 00:17:56.591\nthat one can carry a lot more amperage.\n\n344\n00:17:56.591 --> 00:17:58.268\nAnd when you start looking\nat these power supplies,\n\n345\n00:17:58.268 --> 00:18:00.210\nyou've gotta understand\nwhat that amperage is.\n\n346\n00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.590\nIf we look at this power supply and really\nzoom in on what's written on it right.\n\n347\n00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.260\nLets take a look at some of\nthe numbers that are on here.\n\n348\n00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:12.030\nWhere I found the 400 watts,\nwas way down here towards the bottom,\n\n349\n00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:17.430\nwhere it says Max total continuous\noutput power shall not exceed 400 watts.\n\n350\n00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.410\nSo that's telling me that this is\neffectively a 400 watt power supply.\n\n351\n00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:24.160\nNow it is saying the max,\nso we could drop lower.\n\n352\n00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.160\nWith a lot of this stuff,\n\n353\n00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.360\nit's okay to drop lower,\nas long as you don't go higher.\n\n354\n00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.750\nIf we try and exceed 400 watts, we're\ngonna need more power to do it, okay.\n\n355\n00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:37.110\nAnd then if you look up here at the input\nsection, it's telling me the input.\n\n356\n00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:41.940\nThis power supply is rated for\nboth 120 and 240, it'll take either one.\n\n357\n00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:47.110\nAnd see how the ranges,\nit will take 100 all the way to 127 volts.\n\n358\n00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.560\nOr it will take 200 all\nthe way to 240 volts.\n\n359\n00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:54.550\nSo I might have a 240 outlet, but\nit dips down to 230, 220, 210,\n\n360\n00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:58.800\nright, it can dip down and\ncome back up and I'll be okay.\n\n361\n00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.330\nAnd on a 120 outlet, I can carry 6 amps.\n\n362\n00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.260\nBut on a 240 outlet,\nI can only carry 3 amps.\n\n363\n00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.230\nSo see how the amperage goes lower?\n\n364\n00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:16.540\nWell, when I look at the output of this\nguy, the output has a 33 amp maximum.\n\n365\n00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:20.190\nIf I'm only inputting a maximum of\nsix amps, how can I output 33 amps?\n\n366\n00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:26.700\nWell, if I'm bringing in\n120 volts at six amps and\n\n367\n00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:33.400\nI lower the voltage all the way down\nto 12 volts, the amperage goes up,\n\n368\n00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.360\nmy amperage increases because\nmy voltage is decreasing.\n\n369\n00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:41.430\nRemember the formula, right,\nvoltage times amperage equals my power,\n\n370\n00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.860\nright, my wattage.\n\n371\n00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.410\nSo that number is tied to the other ones,\nso that's how the number goes up.\n\n372\n00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:52.320\nAnd if you look over here though at\nthe five volt, 5V is listed at a 3A MAX.\n\n373\n00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:57.580\nNow, how did I get all the way down\nto 5V and I'm just down at 3A MAX.\n\n374\n00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.510\nWell, see how it's VSB, right?\n\n375\n00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.920\nWhat it's actually doing\nis stepping it down.\n\n376\n00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.170\nInside of this power supply there's\nadditional equipment that's doing things,\n\n377\n00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.130\nand I forget the names of some of them\nbecause they've got crazy names, but\n\n378\n00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.660\nthey step down the amperage because\nthose wires are really thin.\n\n379\n00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.150\nThose little 5 volts,\nthose are the ones that run to your\n\n380\n00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.790\nSATA connectors to power your hard drives,\nthey're tiny.\n\n381\n00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:21.225\nThe 12 volt ones, those will be the bigger\nwires that run to your motherboard and so\n\n382\n00:20:21.225 --> 00:20:25.551\non, and you'll see some of those here on\nthis kind of machine that's on the desk.\n\n383\n00:20:25.551 --> 00:20:28.613\nWe got a power supply and it's got\na big cable that comes out of it up\n\n384\n00:20:28.613 --> 00:20:31.301\nhere that branches out to all\nthe different components.\n\n385\n00:20:31.301 --> 00:20:33.826\nAnd when you look at this\nbig rainbow cable up here,\n\n386\n00:20:33.826 --> 00:20:37.270\nthese are the thicker cables\nthat run to the motherboard.\n\n387\n00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.200\nAnd at least one of those\nwill be carrying 48 volts,\n\n388\n00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.180\nbecause the motherboard can handle it.\n\n389\n00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.770\nBut then you've got a bunch of\nlittle cables that run like here,\n\n390\n00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:46.870\nour sata connectors.\n\n391\n00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.675\nAnd they're all black, so\nit's really hard to see.\n\n392\n00:20:48.675 --> 00:20:49.835\nBut they're tiny cables.\n\n393\n00:20:49.835 --> 00:20:52.715\nAnd those would be 5 volt or\n12 volt, right?\n\n394\n00:20:52.715 --> 00:20:55.395\nAnd that's what you're gonna see\nwhen you look inside of a server\n\n395\n00:20:55.395 --> 00:20:57.475\nis these varying cable sizes.\n\n396\n00:20:57.475 --> 00:21:00.995\nAnd the power supply is what's responsible\nfor doing that transformation and\n\n397\n00:21:00.995 --> 00:21:03.105\nthen sending it into the system.\n\n398\n00:21:03.105 --> 00:21:07.620\nSo the key thing to remember\nhere is that your voltage and\n\n399\n00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.321\nyour current are tied together.\n\n400\n00:21:10.321 --> 00:21:13.500\nAnd when you increase one,\nthe other decreases.\n\n401\n00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.900\nOr if you increase the other,\nthe first one decreases, so\n\n402\n00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.580\nthey're tied to each other.\n\n403\n00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.790\nAnd there's some\nflexibility in the numbers.\n\n404\n00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:22.743\nIt's not an official rule, but\nmost electricians will tell you,\n\n405\n00:21:22.743 --> 00:21:24.460\nI have this 10% rule.\n\n406\n00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.420\nThat if I have a wall outlet that's 1.20,\n\n407\n00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:31.360\nthat I could lose 10% of that and\nI'll probably be fine.\n\n408\n00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:36.400\nSo 10% of 120 is 12, so if we drop\ndown to 108, I'd be okay, right?\n\n409\n00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.290\nI lost 10%, but I'm at 108, I'm fine.\n\n410\n00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:40.589\nIt's not always true though.\n\n411\n00:21:40.589 --> 00:21:43.761\nNow, I keep saying 120 and 240.\n\n412\n00:21:43.761 --> 00:21:46.303\nWhen you go to the store and\nyou buy a lamp or\n\n413\n00:21:46.303 --> 00:21:51.210\nwhatever, you don't see 120 and\n240 do you, you see 110 and 220.\n\n414\n00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:54.040\nHey, I got this server power supply and\nit says 220 on it.\n\n415\n00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.354\nOr, what did this one say?\n\n416\n00:21:55.354 --> 00:21:56.553\nAs I rattle on, here.\n\n417\n00:21:56.553 --> 00:21:58.101\nWell it's at 200 to 240, right?\n\n418\n00:21:58.101 --> 00:21:59.205\nGave you that whole range.\n\n419\n00:21:59.205 --> 00:22:03.993\nSo, it could go as low as 200 or as high\nas 240 and it's gonna be okay, right.\n\n420\n00:22:03.993 --> 00:22:06.930\nIf it gets below 200,\nnow it's got a problem.\n\n421\n00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.570\nAnd the same thing with 100 and 127.\n\n422\n00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:13.840\nSo, when you buy a light bulb and\nit says it's 110 volt, what that actually\n\n423\n00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:20.070\nmeans is, it's expecting 120, but\nif it dips as low as 110, it'll be fine.\n\n424\n00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:24.120\nIf it dips to 109, maybe not so\nmuch any more, right.\n\n425\n00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.540\nAnd that's why you have this\nunofficial 10% rule, if you dip down\n\n426\n00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.530\neventually you reach a point where\nyou're just not getting enough power,\n\n427\n00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.510\nthings just don't function any more.\n\n428\n00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:35.663\nSo, when I buy a server,\nand I'm given a choice.\n\n429\n00:22:35.663 --> 00:22:40.103\nDo I wanna run it 120 or\ndo I wanna run it 240, right?\n\n430\n00:22:40.103 --> 00:22:46.570\nWell, we've got to pick, and if you do\n240, the cabling is cheaper, right?\n\n431\n00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.387\nThe circuit is cheaper in most countries.\n\n432\n00:22:48.387 --> 00:22:50.716\nIn the US it isn't,\nbecause we messed things up a bit.\n\n433\n00:22:50.716 --> 00:22:53.570\nBut in most countries\nit's cheaper to go 240.\n\n434\n00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:59.030\nAnd you're able to send a higher voltage,\nwhich results in a lower amperage,\n\n435\n00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.900\nand so your electric bill can\noftentimes end up being lower.\n\n436\n00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.960\nBut the rule of thumb is, if you can go\n240 on equipment that's gonna be on all\n\n437\n00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.430\nthe time,\nit usually makes sense to do that.\n\n438\n00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:13.100\nIf it's equipment that's just going on and\noff and on and off, then 120 is fine.\n\n439\n00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.839\nBut usually we wanna try and go 240,\n\n440\n00:23:14.839 --> 00:23:17.908\nbecause it can be a little more\nefficient and give you a cost savings.\n\n441\n00:23:17.908 --> 00:23:21.618\nNow, here in the US we\ndon't actually run 240.\n\n442\n00:23:21.618 --> 00:23:23.407\nSo when you get a 240 outlet,\n\n443\n00:23:23.407 --> 00:23:28.330\nwhat's really happening is they're\ntaking two 120s and combining them.\n\n444\n00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:32.190\nSo, any efficiency that you had by going\n240 you kinda lost, cuz you're really just\n\n445\n00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.460\npulling these two 120s together,\ncombining it to create a 240.\n\n446\n00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.400\nSo, it's not such a great\nthing here in the US, but\n\n447\n00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.540\nin other countries it works\nout really well, all right.\n\n448\n00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.590\nSo, that's kind of the key thing there\nthat we need to understand when it comes\n\n449\n00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:47.370\nto power,\nis that these numbers are tied together.\n\n450\n00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:50.740\nAnd when you buy servers in today's world,\n\n451\n00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.290\nthe majority of them\nare rated to run either way.\n\n452\n00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:56.006\nWhere you start to see exceptions though,\nis in network infrastructure.\n\n453\n00:23:56.006 --> 00:23:58.475\nI mention the Cisco Catalyst 6500 switch.\n\n454\n00:23:58.475 --> 00:24:00.411\nThe 6509s or whatever.\n\n455\n00:24:00.411 --> 00:24:04.269\nThey're big switches, and\nthey have big power supplies on them.\n\n456\n00:24:04.269 --> 00:24:06.866\nAnd they can run off of 120.\n\n457\n00:24:06.866 --> 00:24:11.255\nBut if you're doing PoE, if you're\ndoing Power over Ethernet, right, or\n\n458\n00:24:11.255 --> 00:24:13.733\nPoE+, they need to draw even more power.\n\n459\n00:24:13.733 --> 00:24:16.117\nBecause they're not just providing\npower to themselves anymore,\n\n460\n00:24:16.117 --> 00:24:18.180\nnow they're powering\nother devices downstream.\n\n461\n00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.280\nThey need to draw more current.\n\n462\n00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.760\nAnd on a 120 cable, because of\nthe lower voltage, there's only so\n\n463\n00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.620\nmuch amperage that we can carry over\nthat wire before it catches on fire.\n\n464\n00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.740\nBut if we switch to 240,\nit's a higher voltage.\n\n465\n00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:36.380\nWe can actually carry more amperage\nover that wire within its tolerances and\n\n466\n00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.640\nbe okay over the same wire\nthat we were running 120 on.\n\n467\n00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:44.340\nInstead of going to thinner wire, you can\nstill get the nice thick 240 cable and\n\n468\n00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.130\ncarry even more amperage over it.\n\n469\n00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.906\nAnd so you'll find some power supplies\nwhere they require 240 because of\n\n470\n00:24:49.906 --> 00:24:51.560\nthe increased power.\n\n471\n00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:56.400\nNow, this server that I've got sitting\nhere only has one physical CPU in it, and\n\n472\n00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.730\nso it's rated for both.\n\n473\n00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:01.265\nAnd in fact, all the servers in\nour closet behind us are rated for\n\n474\n00:25:01.265 --> 00:25:03.439\nboth, they'll do 120 and 240.\n\n475\n00:25:03.439 --> 00:25:06.230\nI think the biggest server\nin there has four CPUs.\n\n476\n00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.250\nBut when you start\ngetting into mainframes,\n\n477\n00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:13.840\nwhen you have servers that have\n64 physical processors in them,\n\n478\n00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.080\nI'm not talking cores,\nI'm talking about 64 physical CPUs.\n\n479\n00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.905\nThey draw a lot of power,\nright, a ton of power.\n\n480\n00:25:18.905 --> 00:25:24.093\nIf each CPU is drawing 0.2 amps and\nyou've got 64 of the things,\n\n481\n00:25:24.093 --> 00:25:27.400\nthat adds up to a good bit of amperage.\n\n482\n00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.520\nUsually it's more than what\nyou can carry over a 120 line.\n\n483\n00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.550\nAnd so those servers will require 240,\nyou'll have to have it.\n\n484\n00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:38.220\nSo when you purchase a server,\nyou've gotta identify that.\n\n485\n00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.000\nYou've gotta look and figure out\nwhat the power requirements are.\n\n486\n00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.306\nI know too many people who have bought\nswitches and they couldn't plug them in\n\n487\n00:25:43.306 --> 00:25:45.239\ncuz they didn't pay attention\nto what the power supplies were.\n\n488\n00:25:45.239 --> 00:25:49.227\n&gt;&gt; Don, one of the things I was gonna ask\nhere is that it's, is this something for\n\n489\n00:25:49.227 --> 00:25:53.036\nthe certification exam or is this\nsomething that you really need to know for\n\n490\n00:25:53.036 --> 00:25:53.895\nthe real world?\n\n491\n00:25:53.895 --> 00:25:56.805\nAnd now I think I'm kinda answering that\nquestion cuz it seems like you really\n\n492\n00:25:56.805 --> 00:25:59.147\nneed to know this stuff if you're\ngonna be in the data center.\n\n493\n00:25:59.147 --> 00:26:03.425\nAnd, by the way, AWG, that's the American\nwire gauge, that's why A double G-\n\n494\n00:26:03.425 --> 00:26:04.180\n&gt;&gt; All right, so [CROSSTALK] gauge.\n\n495\n00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.606\n&gt;&gt; There's actually a method, yeah,\nthere's a method to the madness there.\n\n496\n00:26:06.606 --> 00:26:08.474\n&gt;&gt; All right and apparently it's American,\nI didn't know that either.\n\n497\n00:26:08.474 --> 00:26:11.690\nSo that means if you're in another country\nyou might not be able to trust it.\n\n498\n00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.220\nGauge is a stupid unit of measurement\nanyway cuz it's one of those where\n\n499\n00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.200\nthe smaller the number,\nthe bigger the cable.\n\n500\n00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.850\nIt's backwards, for whatever reason.\n\n501\n00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.643\nSo it's just one of those\nthings that's out there though.\n\n502\n00:26:21.643 --> 00:26:25.450\nBut yeah,\nit is something you need to know.\n\n503\n00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.540\nEven for your household stuff,\nyou really need to know it.\n\n504\n00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.037\nBut in a data center it's super\nimportant cuz you're gonna have so\n\n505\n00:26:30.037 --> 00:26:30.893\nmuch different gear.\n\n506\n00:26:30.893 --> 00:26:34.030\nAnd you've gotta make sure you're\nprovided the proper amount of power.\n\n507\n00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.430\nWhen you have a rack that's loaded up\nwith servers, and you're using power\n\n508\n00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.890\ndistribution units, we're gonna talk\nabout them in another episode, PDUs.\n\n509\n00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:45.430\nHow do you know that you're providing\nenough amperage to all of your servers?\n\n510\n00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.640\nWell, you need to keep\na running checklist.\n\n511\n00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.680\nYou need to have a list of,\n\n512\n00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.800\nhere's all the power supplies that\nare connected to this circuit.\n\n513\n00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.430\nHow many circuits do we need?\n\n514\n00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:55.470\nYou'll probably need\nmore than one circuit.\n\n515\n00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:59.256\nAnd that leads us to a whole nother topic,\nwhich is, in power,\n\n516\n00:26:59.256 --> 00:27:02.270\nyou have single-phase and\nmulti-phase power.\n\n517\n00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.319\nUsually it's either one or three phases.\n\n518\n00:27:04.319 --> 00:27:08.818\nSo single-phase power is what you normally\nhave in a wall socket on your wall.\n\n519\n00:27:08.818 --> 00:27:13.558\nYou walk up to it, you plug in,\nand you're just getting a single,\n\n520\n00:27:13.558 --> 00:27:18.850\nin our case it'd be 120 volt power\nsource that's coming through.\n\n521\n00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:20.570\nAnd that's all you get.\n\n522\n00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:21.810\nAnd remember the sine waves,\n\n523\n00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.760\nhow I was talking about how it goes up and\nthen it comes down.\n\n524\n00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.010\nAnd when it hits that horizontal line,\nso it goes up and it comes down,\n\n525\n00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.510\nwhen it hits that horizontal\nline you're getting nothing.\n\n526\n00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.283\nAnd then it dips down and\nit goes negative, and comes back up and\n\n527\n00:27:32.283 --> 00:27:33.060\nyou're getting nothing.\n\n528\n00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.720\nAnd then it goes positive and\nit comes back and you're getting nothing.\n\n529\n00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.580\nSo you're constantly getting nothing\nevery so often on that interval.\n\n530\n00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:42.070\nWith single-phase power,\nthat's what happens.\n\n531\n00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:46.820\nWell, multi-phase power, like three-phase\npower, it does something really cool.\n\n532\n00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.970\nWhich is it sends three\ndifferent sine waves.\n\n533\n00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:52.550\nSo each one's slightly offset.\n\n534\n00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:58.270\nSo when one hits the axes and\nis zeroed out, the the other two aren't.\n\n535\n00:27:58.270 --> 00:27:59.852\nAnd the other two are at different areas.\n\n536\n00:27:59.852 --> 00:28:04.619\nSo that you've always got at least one,\nbut usually two phases are providing\n\n537\n00:28:04.619 --> 00:28:09.258\nsome level of power when one of\nthe phases grounds out to zero, right?\n\n538\n00:28:09.258 --> 00:28:15.250\nSo with three-phase, you get a much more\nconsistent amount of power being provided.\n\n539\n00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:20.490\nThe other thing about three-phase is that\nyou can run a single three-phase line and\n\n540\n00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:24.970\nthen you can split the phases out\ninto three separate circuits.\n\n541\n00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.750\nSo you can provide multiple\ncircuits across a single line,\n\n542\n00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.810\nthat's another advantage\nof doing three-phase.\n\n543\n00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.110\nSo when you get into a data center,\n\n544\n00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:35.740\nyou may have some equipment\nthat requires three-phase.\n\n545\n00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:39.846\nIt's normally really easy to spot,\nbecause we have 120 and we have 240,\n\n546\n00:28:39.846 --> 00:28:42.438\nthose are pretty consistent for\nsingle-phase.\n\n547\n00:28:42.438 --> 00:28:47.243\nAlthough in the United States 240\nsort of is two-phase cuz you got two\n\n548\n00:28:47.243 --> 00:28:52.380\n120s linked together, but\nthey're typically at the same phase.\n\n549\n00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.700\nBut when you get to three-phase,\nthere is three-phase 240,\n\n550\n00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.330\nyou just don't see it very often.\n\n551\n00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:00.370\nIt's normally 208,\nthat you'll get 208 volts.\n\n552\n00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:04.900\nAnd if you ever see it you're like,\n208 volts, what the heck is that?\n\n553\n00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.960\nThey must mean 220.\n\n554\n00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.776\nAnd there is some equipment\nthat'll do okay and cheat with it.\n\n555\n00:29:09.776 --> 00:29:14.667\nBut there's a lot of equipment like\nthe big Liebert air conditioning units\n\n556\n00:29:14.667 --> 00:29:19.646\nthat you see in data centers, or\nsome UPSs where they actually want 208.\n\n557\n00:29:19.646 --> 00:29:24.038\nAnd they want it to be three-phase and\nif you give it to them in any other form,\n\n558\n00:29:24.038 --> 00:29:25.920\nit's a mess, all right.\n\n559\n00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.580\nNow where does that 208 number come from,\nright?\n\n560\n00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:32.519\n120 kind of makes sense if you\nthink about the sine wave.\n\n561\n00:29:32.519 --> 00:29:35.396\nRemember how I mentioned the sine\nwave is in these 60 second windows?\n\n562\n00:29:35.396 --> 00:29:40.118\nThat if you have a positive and\na negative leg of the sine wave, 60 and\n\n563\n00:29:40.118 --> 00:29:41.729\n60 adds up to 120.\n\n564\n00:29:41.729 --> 00:29:43.361\nRight, so there we get our 120.\n\n565\n00:29:43.361 --> 00:29:49.390\nWell, if you take 120 and you double up\nthat, you get to 240 so that makes sense.\n\n566\n00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.120\nWhere's the 208 come from?\n\n567\n00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:55.240\nI always wonder that, and a few years ago\nI asked a facilities guy that I worked\n\n568\n00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.970\nwith and he drew me a picture and\nit blew my mind.\n\n569\n00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:02.000\nSo I'm gonna show you this picture,\nand I can't take credit for this.\n\n570\n00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.460\nTom, if you're watching,\nthank you for showing me this.\n\n571\n00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:09.206\nBut basically he said, draw a circle and\nimagine that the radius of\n\n572\n00:30:09.206 --> 00:30:13.550\nthat circle is 120,\nlike a 120 volt circuit, right?\n\n573\n00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.022\nSo I did that.\n\n574\n00:30:15.022 --> 00:30:18.519\nAnd then he said, all right,\nnow, if you got a radius of 120,\n\n575\n00:30:18.519 --> 00:30:21.140\nthen it would have a diameter of 240,\nright?\n\n576\n00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.230\nThe diameter, the line straight\nthrough the circle, would be 240.\n\n577\n00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:26.190\nAll right, so\nthis is the circle that I've got drawn.\n\n578\n00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:31.390\nAnd he said, then put a triangle in it,\nput a triangle in the circle.\n\n579\n00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:37.268\nAnd when you do that,\neach leg of your triangle would be 208.\n\n580\n00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:41.360\nLet's just say that these\nwere centimeters, right.\n\n581\n00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.560\nSo if it was 120 centimeters and\nI double it up to 240 centimeters, so\n\n582\n00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.620\nI've got a circle with\na diameter of 240 centimeters.\n\n583\n00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:53.070\nThat when you draw the lines and\ncalculate out the length of that side,\n\n584\n00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.390\nit would be 208 centimeters.\n\n585\n00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:57.675\nThat's where that number comes from so\n\n586\n00:30:57.675 --> 00:31:00.230\nthere's a mathematical\nprinciple behind this.\n\n587\n00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:05.248\nAnd he said if you continue\nto think that way and\n\n588\n00:31:05.248 --> 00:31:09.752\nyou put your radius back in, what you have\n\n589\n00:31:09.752 --> 00:31:15.168\nare three 120 radius lines and three 208s.\n\n590\n00:31:15.168 --> 00:31:18.336\nAnd he said the way it works\nis when you provide it,\n\n591\n00:31:18.336 --> 00:31:23.250\nif the device you plug into connects\nto two of the legs, they'll get 208.\n\n592\n00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:26.920\nThe line-to-line voltage is 208.\n\n593\n00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.421\nBut if they grab just one line,\nthey'll get 120.\n\n594\n00:31:29.421 --> 00:31:34.160\nAnd so you could grab all three, and\nyou've effectively got three 120 circuits.\n\n595\n00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:37.889\nOr you can grab two and a neutral,\nand then you'll get 208.\n\n596\n00:31:37.889 --> 00:31:40.516\nAnd so it's able to pull\nthe power that it needs, and\n\n597\n00:31:40.516 --> 00:31:43.220\nit's able to grab that information and\nwork with it.\n\n598\n00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.534\nIt can even convert it into 240 if it\nneeds it, even though, technically,\n\n599\n00:31:46.534 --> 00:31:47.651\nit's three 120 legs.\n\n600\n00:31:47.651 --> 00:31:49.910\nIt can just grab a couple of them and\nconvert them.\n\n601\n00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:52.730\nSo it's kind of a neat thing,\nthere's a little bit of mathematics that\n\n602\n00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:54.659\ngoes behind this that gets\nout of my skill level.\n\n603\n00:31:54.659 --> 00:31:56.059\nHe drew this picture for me and\n\n604\n00:31:56.059 --> 00:31:59.316\nit really kinda helped me to\nunderstand where that 208 came from.\n\n605\n00:31:59.316 --> 00:32:00.507\nThat's fascinating.\n\n606\n00:32:00.507 --> 00:32:01.651\nIt always comes back to math.\n\n607\n00:32:01.651 --> 00:32:05.895\nDon, I had a question about the triple\nphase, right, the three phase?\n\n608\n00:32:05.895 --> 00:32:08.020\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; If you split them off like that,\n\n609\n00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:12.420\nwhile it does overall,\nthe circuit continues to be three phase.\n\n610\n00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:17.090\nDoes each individual device,\nwould that be a single phase device?\n\n611\n00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:20.019\nSo is it a division of the overall\ncircuit that you have?\n\n612\n00:32:20.019 --> 00:32:22.286\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you split them\nout they're all gonna see it,\n\n613\n00:32:22.286 --> 00:32:24.209\nthe end devices would\nsee the single phase, so\n\n614\n00:32:24.209 --> 00:32:27.886\nyou kind of lost the advantage there,\nnow you're just using it as a trunk line.\n\n615\n00:32:27.886 --> 00:32:31.570\nBut, when you're talking about these\nbig AC units, they're expecting that\n\n616\n00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:34.750\ntriple phase to come right in\nthem because they're using it and\n\n617\n00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:37.340\nthen they're gonna handle it, they'll\nget a more consistent level of power.\n\n618\n00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.921\nThey're expecting constant power,\nand if we were to divide it up,\n\n619\n00:32:39.921 --> 00:32:43.070\nthey wouldn't be getting that constant\npower anymore to really screw things up.\n\n620\n00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:47.620\nAn example I can give of that is,\nthink about a bicycle.\n\n621\n00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.948\nWhen I'm on a bicycle,\nthere's one set of pedals, right.\n\n622\n00:32:49.948 --> 00:32:53.257\nThere might be two pedals, but\nthey're really connected together, so\n\n623\n00:32:53.257 --> 00:32:56.170\nwhen I push on the pedals,\nmy bike goes forward.\n\n624\n00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:59.888\nIf I push on just one pedal,\nwhen I'm pushing down,\n\n625\n00:32:59.888 --> 00:33:02.011\nit makes the bike go forward.\n\n626\n00:33:02.011 --> 00:33:05.780\nAnd when I'm coming back up,\nthat doesn't do anything, right?\n\n627\n00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.700\nWhen you're coming back up on that pedal,\nnothing is happening.\n\n628\n00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.265\nAnd then as you push again,\nthat's making it forward.\n\n629\n00:33:10.265 --> 00:33:14.380\nSo the power is coming and going,\ncoming and going, alternating current.\n\n630\n00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:15.650\nWhen you've got two pedals,\n\n631\n00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:20.060\nthough, now you can be pushing down on\none and then pushing down on the other.\n\n632\n00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:24.170\nAnd you're always pushing, and\nnow it's a little more constant, right?\n\n633\n00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:28.100\nWell, there is still a time where\none pedal is all the way down and\n\n634\n00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.030\none pedal is all the way up where\nyou're actually not applying force.\n\n635\n00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:33.001\nBut it's the briefest of moments.\n\n636\n00:33:33.001 --> 00:33:36.360\nImagine if you had three legs,\nright, and you had three pedals,\n\n637\n00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.726\nI don't know what this bike\nwould look like, exactly.\n\n638\n00:33:37.726 --> 00:33:41.530\nBut you keep pushing on all three,\nand you'd never have a situation where\n\n639\n00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:45.180\ntwo pedals were perfectly up and\ndown because you've got three pedals, and\n\n640\n00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:47.850\nthat's what three phase does,\nis you're able to constantly push.\n\n641\n00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:52.150\nI guess maybe a better example would\nbe a tandem bike with three people,\n\n642\n00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:54.970\nbut maybe one of them's got their\nfeet up on the handlebars and\n\n643\n00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:56.580\nthat example breaks down really fast.\n\n644\n00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:58.530\nSo, but that's how this stuff works, and\n\n645\n00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:01.450\nit is important to understand\nthe requirements of your equipment\n\n646\n00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:04.940\nwhen you're shopping for equipment or\nthe existing equipment you've already got.\n\n647\n00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.960\nDon't assume they all use the same power,\n\n648\n00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:12.650\nbecause there are variations,\nright, and it does get confusing.\n\n649\n00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:15.442\nAnother thing that's confusing, I know\nI'm low on time but I want to mention.\n\n650\n00:34:15.442 --> 00:34:22.055\nI mentioned 48-volt power and how inside\nof a computer you'll normally see 48-volt.\n\n651\n00:34:22.055 --> 00:34:24.320\n48-volt can be used a few\ndifferent places, and\n\n652\n00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.210\nsometimes it's written negative 48-volt,\nand remember,\n\n653\n00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:29.250\nwhat we're talking about with\na current there's a sine wave, right?\n\n654\n00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:31.230\nSo there's a positive and\na negative part of it, and so\n\n655\n00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:35.810\nnegative 48 volt would just be on\nthe down leg of that sine wave.\n\n656\n00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:39.250\nAnd positive 48 volt would\nbe on the upper sine wave.\n\n657\n00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:40.930\nEquipment can use the negative side,\nright.\n\n658\n00:34:40.930 --> 00:34:43.120\nYou don't always have to\nuse the positive side.\n\n659\n00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.960\nSo you can use the dark side.\n\n660\n00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.160\nIt's like Star Wars.\n\n661\n00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.560\nThen we can use this and\nget the power that we need.\n\n662\n00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.530\nSo you'll see those used interchangeably.\n\n663\n00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:53.240\nNegative 48 volt, positive 48 volt.\n\n664\n00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.520\nI think the exam objective actually uses,\nboth get kinda thrown out there.\n\n665\n00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:00.590\nInside of a computer, you'll see\n48-volt come out of a power supply.\n\n666\n00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.460\nSometimes you'll get network routers and\n\n667\n00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:07.390\nswitches that have one\npower supply in them.\n\n668\n00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:11.530\nAnd then it'll say that you can hook\nup an external redundant power supply.\n\n669\n00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:15.100\nAnd there will be a little port on\nthe back of the device that'll let you\n\n670\n00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.880\nplug in an external power supply.\n\n671\n00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:22.250\nThose, not always, but almost always,\na lot of the time, are 48-volt.\n\n672\n00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.830\nThey have a little harness connector\nthat connects to some kind of\n\n673\n00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:25.640\nextra battery pack.\n\n674\n00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.742\nWe used to do them with Cisco\nequipment all the time.\n\n675\n00:35:27.742 --> 00:35:31.230\nI know I've got a couple of Cisco Catalyst\nswitches is back in the closet right now\n\n676\n00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:33.700\nthat have those 48-volt\nconnectors on the back.\n\n677\n00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.390\nSo 48-volt is not always internal.\n\n678\n00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:39.330\nSometimes it's an external device that's\nconnecting, but it's usually gonna be\n\n679\n00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:43.610\na power supply that's connecting, or\npotentially a battery backup for 48-volt.\n\n680\n00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:45.360\nBut that's usually where you see that.\n\n681\n00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.410\nI don't think I've ever seen\na 48-volt wall socket on a wall.\n\n682\n00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.860\nThat's just not something that happens.\n\n683\n00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.490\n&gt;&gt; Well done.\nThat's a lot of great information.\n\n684\n00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:55.850\nAnd it's interesting some of\nthe entry level science behind it.\n\n685\n00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:57.720\nI know I find it fascinating.\n\n686\n00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.230\nAnd you have already mentioned that it\ndoes look like we're coming to the end of\n\n687\n00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.930\nanother episode.\n\n688\n00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:02.650\nBut I know that we still\nhave some more to go.\n\n689\n00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:03.790\nSo how about we do this?\n\n690\n00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:07.300\nHow about we go into a part two,\nand we'll come back and\n\n691\n00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:10.980\nfinish the rest of the concepts and\ntopics that you have to talk about.\n\n692\n00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:11.680\nBut before you do,\n\n693\n00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.470\ndo you have any additional words that\nyou'd like to throw in this one?\n\n694\n00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.750\n&gt;&gt; Let me just tell them one\nlast thing on triple phase.\n\n695\n00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:19.580\nOn triple phase, I focused on 208,\ncuz that's the most common.\n\n696\n00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:23.456\nBut there's also another\none that's a little weird,\n\n697\n00:36:23.456 --> 00:36:26.496\ncuz it can be 440, 460, or 480.\n\n698\n00:36:26.496 --> 00:36:27.679\nThere we go.\nLet me get it right.\n\n699\n00:36:27.679 --> 00:36:32.320\n440, 460, or 480 volt, really high.\n\n700\n00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:36.590\nThat's another three-phase power\nsystem that you'll see out there.\n\n701\n00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:39.150\nIt's just incredibly efficient,\ncuz the voltage is so high.\n\n702\n00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:41.500\nIt can carry some really high amperage.\n\n703\n00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.510\nYou're not normally gonna\nhave to mess with that one.\n\n704\n00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:46.680\nMaybe if you have the big diesel power\ngenerators outside that are powering\n\n705\n00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.990\nyour building, they might carry\nsome of the 440, or whatever.\n\n706\n00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:54.350\n440, 460 and 480 are basically\ninterchangeable devices at that\n\n707\n00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:58.100\nhigh level of voltage, they're designed to\ntolerate the difference between the three.\n\n708\n00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:01.390\nSo we don't normally nitpick at that\npoint over which of the three we get.\n\n709\n00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:05.840\nBut that's another three-phase\npower system that's out there.\n\n710\n00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.900\nReally, really high amount\nof power on that one.\n\n711\n00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:11.370\nReally super mega dangerous too,\nso it's usually very well labeled.\n\n712\n00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:16.212\nBecause this is the power that reaches the\nlevels that can really put you down pretty\n\n713\n00:37:16.212 --> 00:37:16.914\nfast, so.\n\n714\n00:37:16.914 --> 00:37:19.582\n&gt;&gt; We got a lot more to talk on power,\nthough, we'll save it for part two, so\n\n715\n00:37:19.582 --> 00:37:21.290\nI don't wanna ramble on to much.\n\n716\n00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:23.380\n&gt;&gt; All right great,\nwell that's a great place to stop Don.\n\n717\n00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.810\nThank you for being here, and\nthank you the viewer watching.\n\n718\n00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:29.770\nKeep in mind anytime you're dealing with\nelectrical equipment, be very careful.\n\n719\n00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:32.578\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n720\n00:37:32.578 --> 00:37:35.839\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet and\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n721\n00:37:35.839 -->

00:00:08.216\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.216 --> 00:00:11.583\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.583 --> 00:00:14.091\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.091 --> 00:00:15.752\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:15.752 --> 00:00:17.008\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:20.674\nwe're continuing through our CompTIA\nserver plus certification course.\n\n9\n00:00:20.674 --> 00:00:24.474\nAnd we've been looking at electrical\nconcerns here and joining us back for\n\n10\n00:00:24.474 --> 00:00:26.722\na part two is none other than Mr.\nDon Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:26.722 --> 00:00:27.559\nDon, how you doing, Sir?\n\n12\n00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:29.021\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing just well, Wes.\n\n13\n00:00:29.021 --> 00:00:32.037\nReady [LAUGH] to dive right\nback into power and cooling.\n\n14\n00:00:32.037 --> 00:00:35.675\nI was trying to think of a good joke there\nabout how we are two people to just exude\n\n15\n00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:37.350\npower and cool.\n\n16\n00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.090\nWell, that couldn't work out.\n\n17\n00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.700\nI guess maybe the statement\nis a joke in and of itself.\n\n18\n00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.820\nSo, anyhow, enough of that.\n\n19\n00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.910\nWe're gonna talk about power.\n\n20\n00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.930\nI've got a few more points that I wanted\nto hit on on power that we need to be\n\n21\n00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.840\nconcerned about.\n\n22\n00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.660\nAnd then we're gonna talk about\ncooling inside of servers.\n\n23\n00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.220\nNow I know I got ahead of myself and\ntalked about it in another episode, but\n\n24\n00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.350\nwe'll talk a little bit\nmore about it here.\n\n25\n00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.551\nLet's get back to power.\nSo, in the last episode, I talked a lot\n\n26\n00:00:56.551 --> 00:01:01.334\nabout the concepts of current and\nvoltage and just power wattage.\n\n27\n00:01:01.334 --> 00:01:02.402\nAnd we talked about those.\n\n28\n00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:06.660\nAnother key concept that we need to\nunderstand is that electricity costs\n\n29\n00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.161\nmoney.\n\n30\n00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:10.667\nIt's an unavoidable fact.\n\n31\n00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:14.232\nEven if you set up your own power\nsource of some sort like a wind farm,\n\n32\n00:01:14.232 --> 00:01:15.184\nor solar panels.\n\n33\n00:01:15.184 --> 00:01:17.123\nThose things have a cost too.\n\n34\n00:01:17.123 --> 00:01:20.619\nAnd so we've gotta make sure\nthat in our data centers,\n\n35\n00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.495\nwe are able to measure and\ntrack what those cost are gonna be.\n\n36\n00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:25.714\nThat's really important.\n\n37\n00:01:25.714 --> 00:01:30.228\nJust as an example, it was actually\nus several years ago where we had,\n\n38\n00:01:30.228 --> 00:01:34.985\nI think it was four servers that were\nin our server room that were running.\n\n39\n00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:36.796\nThey ran 24 hours a day.\n\n40\n00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:38.804\nThey were doing their job and\nthey were doing their job fine.\n\n41\n00:01:38.804 --> 00:01:42.191\nAnd usually you replace\nservers every three years and\n\n42\n00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:46.641\nwe hit the three year mark in these\nservers, and they were doing fine.\n\n43\n00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:49.459\nSo we didn't feel the need to\nreplace them and so, I said, yeah,\n\n44\n00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.380\nwe're not gonna replace them,\nwe'll just keep them.\n\n45\n00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.120\nAnd one of the other guys came in and\nsaid,\n\n46\n00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.980\nwell, Don, the newer servers that\nout today are more power efficient.\n\n47\n00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.680\nAnd I bet if we replaced the servers,\n\n48\n00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.025\nthe power savings alone will offset\nthe cost of us replacing the servers.\n\n49\n00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:10.129\nAnd I know the term I wanna use but\n\n50\n00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:15.145\nI was disbelieving of that statement.\n\n51\n00:02:15.145 --> 00:02:16.909\nI said that can't be possibly be true.\n\n52\n00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.656\nAnd so what they did is they took\na little meter, kilowatt at the time, and\n\n53\n00:02:21.656 --> 00:02:26.170\nplugged it in to measure\nthe system's power consumption.\n\n54\n00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.060\nAnd they measured the power consumption\nof our servers, our four servers that\n\n55\n00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.690\nwe already had, and showed what that\ncost us in terms of our electric bill.\n\n56\n00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.690\nAnd it was a couple of\nhundred bucks a month really.\n\n57\n00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.600\nOver the course of the year for\nthe four servers.\n\n58\n00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.370\nAnd sure enough, by the time you looked\nat it over the course of a year,\n\n59\n00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.540\nit was a lot of money and that could\noffset the cost of buying new servers.\n\n60\n00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.091\nIt didn't equal out exactly\nbuying four new servers, but\n\n61\n00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:50.329\nit showed that there was a significant\ncost savings with the new servers.\n\n62\n00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.908\nThat you'd be surprized how\nefficient these things can get.\n\n63\n00:02:52.908 --> 00:02:54.465\nAnd we need to be able to track that.\n\n64\n00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:59.520\nNot only that, though, we need to be\nable to track what our maximum draw is.\n\n65\n00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.170\nTo make sure we've got enough\npower to be able to handle it.\n\n66\n00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.553\nSo being able to report on a lot\nof this stuff is important.\n\n67\n00:03:05.553 --> 00:03:07.934\nAnd when you're in a home or\na small office and\n\n68\n00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:11.257\nyou need one power outlet on\nthe wall to split into six outlets,\n\n69\n00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:15.165\nyou just get a surge suppressor,\nwhatever and you pop it in and off you go.\n\n70\n00:03:15.165 --> 00:03:18.750\nYou don't think about things like\nvoltage and current and all that.\n\n71\n00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.700\nBut in a server room, if I have\nsix servers that are all being fed\n\n72\n00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.030\noff of the same link, that's a lot of\namperage to be drawing on one link.\n\n73\n00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.581\nAnd I might be exceeding what that circuit\nis capable of, in which case I'm gonna\n\n74\n00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:34.150\ntrip the circuit, right, which is\nsomething that happens pretty frequently.\n\n75\n00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.085\nBut if we're monitoring that,\nthen we can really see it.\n\n76\n00:03:37.085 --> 00:03:41.692\nAnd when you buy power strips for a data\ncenter, there's companies like APC and\n\n77\n00:03:41.692 --> 00:03:46.094\nTripLight that make really good ones\nthat actually have a little LED right on\n\n78\n00:03:46.094 --> 00:03:49.838\nthem that will tell you how many\namps it's drawing at that time.\n\n79\n00:03:49.838 --> 00:03:52.361\nAnd as you plug in each server,\nyou can see the amperage go up and\n\n80\n00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:54.946\nkeep track of it and, say, whoop,\nthis circuit's at its max.\n\n81\n00:03:54.946 --> 00:03:59.490\nI've got a 30 amp circuit and I'm at\n28 amps, so I'm gonna stop right there.\n\n82\n00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.790\nAnd I'm not gonna add anything more to\nthat one, let me go and do another one.\n\n83\n00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.390\nAnd that lets just track it.\n\n84\n00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.740\nBut we also need to track it for billing.\n\n85\n00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.170\nAnd if you've ever looked\nat your electric billing,\n\n86\n00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.499\nthey always reflect it as killowat hours,\nright?\n\n87\n00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:10.998\nKillowat hours, or kWh.\n\n88\n00:04:10.998 --> 00:04:14.265\nIt's actually a lower case k,\ncapital W, lower case h.\n\n89\n00:04:14.265 --> 00:04:15.773\nThey're really picky about that.\n\n90\n00:04:15.773 --> 00:04:18.140\nKillowat hours are what\nwe're normally billed in.\n\n91\n00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.320\n&gt;&gt; So that should be fairly\neasy to calculate, right Don?\n\n92\n00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.850\nI've got a kilowatt and this how\nmany kilowatts I've used in an hour?\n\n93\n00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.140\nTime domain, measure it up,\nwe're ready to go, right?\n\n94\n00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.850\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nit's one of those weird things where, yes,\n\n95\n00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.480\nit's got hour in the name but\nit's not really talking about an hour.\n\n96\n00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.120\nIt's not actually\na measurement of time at all.\n\n97\n00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.437\nIt's a measure of how\nmany watts you consumed.\n\n98\n00:04:37.437 --> 00:04:40.943\nRight, so a kilowatt is 1,000 watts.\n\n99\n00:04:40.943 --> 00:04:42.325\nThat kinda make sense, right?\n\n100\n00:04:42.325 --> 00:04:46.230\nSo, here let me get a text window open and\nwe'll write this out.\n\n101\n00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.380\nSo, what we're talking about\nour kilowatt hours, right?\n\n102\n00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.780\nOr kWh as it's normally written on a bill,\nright?\n\n103\n00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.210\nThat's the unit measure\nthat we're talking about.\n\n104\n00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.510\nAnd when we calculate that out, a kWh =\n\n105\n00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.130\n1000 Watts, or\nreally a kW is what equals 1000 Watts.\n\n106\n00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.230\nSo when we talk about a kilowatt hour,\n\n107\n00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.880\nthat doesn't necessarily mean\nthat an hour of time has passed.\n\n108\n00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.680\nAn hour of time, it may have\ntaken ten hours or fifty hours.\n\n109\n00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.545\nIt might have taken 30 minutes\nto consume a kilowatt hour\n\n110\n00:05:22.545 --> 00:05:26.827\nbecause we're not just\nconsuming a fixed number.\n\n111\n00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:31.529\nNot every device consumes\n1,000 kilowatts in an hour.\n\n112\n00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:37.030\nWhen I turn on a lightbulb, it's not\nconsuming 1,000 kilowatts an hour.\n\n113\n00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.100\nNow, if I had a 1,000 watt power supply,\nthen, yeah,\n\n114\n00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.550\nit's consuming a kilowatt per hour.\n\n115\n00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.790\nRight, it just happens to line up,\nbut most things don't.\n\n116\n00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.140\nIf you think about a 40 watt light bulb,\nI'm gonna do some easy math here,\n\n117\n00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.800\nlet's make it a 50 watt light bulb.\n\n118\n00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.020\nIf I have a 50 watt light bulb\nversus a 100 watt light bulb,\n\n119\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.930\nthose light bulbs are drawing\ndifferent wattages.\n\n120\n00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.608\nAnd so if I run them for an hour,\n\n121\n00:06:01.608 --> 00:06:04.848\nthe first one is drawing half\nthe wattage of the second one.\n\n122\n00:06:04.848 --> 00:06:11.325\nSo, for a 50 watt lightbulb to\ndraw 1 kilowatt hour, right?\n\n123\n00:06:11.325 --> 00:06:17.118\nSo if it were to draw 1 kilowatt hour,\nthat would actually take it 20 hours.\n\n124\n00:06:17.118 --> 00:06:22.493\nVersus a 100 watt lightbulb,\nwhich would draw 1 kilowatt hour, if\n\n125\n00:06:22.493 --> 00:06:28.246\nI can get my casing right after I stressed\nit so hard and I can't do it myself.\n\n126\n00:06:28.246 --> 00:06:30.177\nIt would only take 10 hours.\n\n127\n00:06:30.177 --> 00:06:36.870\nCuz it's drawing a 100 watts an hour over\n10 hours, it would draw 1,000 kilo watts.\n\n128\n00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.285\nSo if I'm measuring that light bulb,\nand I see that that lightbulb\n\n129\n00:06:40.285 --> 00:06:44.930\ncosts me one kilowatt hour,\nit actually took me 10 hours to do it.\n\n130\n00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.290\nAnd that's why I say that a kilowatt hour\nis not truly a unit of measure of time.\n\n131\n00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.651\nIt's a measure of wattage consumption.\n\n132\n00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:52.916\nSo, it's really confusing.\n\n133\n00:06:52.916 --> 00:06:57.066\nAnd it's hard to explain to people\ncuz if you look at a power bill,\n\n134\n00:06:57.066 --> 00:07:00.625\nhow can I consume more than\n24 kilowatt hours in a day?\n\n135\n00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:01.799\nThere's only 24 hours.\n\n136\n00:07:01.799 --> 00:07:04.500\nBut that's cuz we're not measuring hours.\n\n137\n00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.540\nWe're measuring the wattage\nthat we consume.\n\n138\n00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.780\nAnd you can consume thousands of\nkilowatt hours in a single day,\n\n139\n00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.225\nif you have enough devices.\n\n140\n00:07:11.225 --> 00:07:16.008\nIf you have, the server power supply,\nI keep waving around here on the screen.\n\n141\n00:07:16.008 --> 00:07:17.088\nIt's a 400 watt power supply.\n\n142\n00:07:17.088 --> 00:07:19.561\nNow granted it's not always\ndrawing at 400 watts, right?\n\n143\n00:07:19.561 --> 00:07:23.202\nBut assuming that this server's\nrunning at full steam all the time,\n\n144\n00:07:23.202 --> 00:07:25.227\nthere's a 400 watt power supply.\n\n145\n00:07:25.227 --> 00:07:28.020\nSo it will consume 400 watts every hour.\n\n146\n00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.780\nWell, if I have a 24 hour day,\n\n147\n00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.660\n24 times 400, that's how many\nwatts I'm gonna draw in a day.\n\n148\n00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.730\nAnd so we can calculate that out and\nfigure out how much it's going to be.\n\n149\n00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:44.120\nThe lower the wattage on the power supply,\nthe lower the draw,\n\n150\n00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.380\nthe more efficient it's gonna be, right?\n\n151\n00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.088\nBut it can only output as\nmuch power as it's taking in.\n\n152\n00:07:49.088 --> 00:07:51.555\nSo if I have a server with 15 hard drives,\n\n153\n00:07:51.555 --> 00:07:55.543\nI might not be able to power that\nwith just a 400 watt power supply.\n\n154\n00:07:55.543 --> 00:07:59.848\nI might need a Kilowatt power supply or\nsomething stronger.\n\n155\n00:07:59.848 --> 00:08:02.360\nOr multiple power supplies if\nI have redundant ones, right?\n\n156\n00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.600\nThat's always possible too.\n\n157\n00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.430\nAnd so that's something we need to think\nabout when we look at this, when you\n\n158\n00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.370\nlook at your electric bill, when you try\nand figure out what that cost is gonna be.\n\n159\n00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.870\nData centers are expensive.\n\n160\n00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:16.930\nYou've got a lot of servers that are\nrunning 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n161\n00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.690\nAnd the CPUs are power hungry,\nthey're drawing a lot of power.\n\n162\n00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.255\nMemory is constantly\nhaving to refresh itself.\n\n163\n00:08:23.255 --> 00:08:24.920\nThat takes electricity to do that.\n\n164\n00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.300\nIt's drawing power.\n\n165\n00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.780\nAnd so\nnewer CPUs are getting more efficient.\n\n166\n00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.250\nWe're starting to see a push for\nARM processors in the data center.\n\n167\n00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.190\nRight?\nARM is what we see in our cell phones,\n\n168\n00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.430\nnot in our computers today.\n\n169\n00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.720\nBut ARM processors are getting faster and\nfaster and faster.\n\n170\n00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.150\nAnd they're more power efficient.\n\n171\n00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.810\nSo if we could have data centers that\nwere decked with ARM processors,\n\n172\n00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.300\nwe'd save a ton on our electric bill.\n\n173\n00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.360\nAs long as we can get\nthe same speed out of it.\n\n174\n00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.980\nSame thing goes for SSD,\n\n175\n00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:56.030\na solid state disk driver draws a lot\nless power than a spinning disk.\n\n176\n00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:00.260\nCuz a spinning disk has a mechanical\nmotor, it's gotta spin that disk.\n\n177\n00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.580\nAnd physical motors converting\nelectricity into physical activity,\n\n178\n00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.920\nit's inefficient just by nature.\n\n179\n00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.890\nSo it's going to consume a lot\nof power to drive that disk,\n\n180\n00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:10.840\nan SSD would be far more efficient.\n\n181\n00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.290\nAnd SSD you can completely power off and\nall the data is still safe.\n\n182\n00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:18.460\nIt's all right there and we can instantly\npower on and grab data when we want it.\n\n183\n00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.250\nSo the power efficiency on those is great.\n\n184\n00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.020\nWe're seeing a movement to SSDs and\nARM processors.\n\n185\n00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.140\nThat'll happen over the next ten years.\n\n186\n00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:30.000\nMost servers have already moved over\nto SSD in the big data centers.\n\n187\n00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.170\nThe small ones are coming along.\n\n188\n00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.410\nThere's still that whole cost thing.\n\n189\n00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.670\nActually everything I've talked\nabout in the last episode and\n\n190\n00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:39.020\nthis one, cost is always a big factor.\n\n191\n00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.530\nBut when it comes to reporting,\nyou'll see most reports in kilowatt hours.\n\n192\n00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:46.000\nAnd just remember that it's not\nactually tied to an hour at all.\n\n193\n00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.310\nIt's really just the amount of\nwatts that devices consume and\n\n194\n00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.300\njust happens to be divided\ninto these hour increments.\n\n195\n00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.850\nThat just kinda makes it sound like it's\ntied to time, but you guys understand.\n\n196\n00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.540\nThe 50 watt versus 100\nwatt is a different draw.\n\n197\n00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.170\nAll right, so some of the other things\nwe need to think about with power.\n\n198\n00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.490\nRedundancy.\n\n199\n00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:09.870\nRedundancy is an important thing when it\ncomes to power because we can lose power.\n\n200\n00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.580\nWes and I, we've got the advantage\nthat we live in Florida.\n\n201\n00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.950\nAnd there's a city here in\nFlorida called Clearwater, and\n\n202\n00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.370\nit is the lightning capital of the world.\n\n203\n00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.950\nMore lightning strikes\nper square mile than\n\n204\n00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.380\nany other location on the entire planet.\n\n205\n00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.620\nAnd lightning is not\nfriendly to electronics.\n\n206\n00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.150\nSo if you live in Florida and you haven't\nlost a power supply in the last year,\n\n207\n00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.210\nyou're the exception, not the norm.\n\n208\n00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.730\nWe have to have surge suppressors and\nthings like that all throughout.\n\n209\n00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.310\nYou'll have entire building surge\nsuppressors because it's so common here.\n\n210\n00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:40.470\nOther areas, maybe not so much.\n\n211\n00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.540\nBut we have it frequently.\n\n212\n00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.545\nSo we need to plan for\nthat kind of failure.\n\n213\n00:10:43.545 --> 00:10:47.829\n&gt;&gt; Don in earlier episode, we were\nlooking at things like server components.\n\n214\n00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:51.555\nAnd as you were dismantling this thing I\nnoticed that there were two power supplies\n\n215\n00:10:51.555 --> 00:10:52.480\ninside the server.\n\n216\n00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.997\nIs this a form of redundancy is this what\nwe can expect to see this is the kind of\n\n217\n00:10:55.997 --> 00:10:56.960\nstuff that you're talking about?\n\n218\n00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and normally it's built around the\nidea of power failing sometimes it's built\n\n219\n00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.845\naround the idea of me that server\nthat was a production server of ours.\n\n220\n00:11:02.845 --> 00:11:06.230\nIt's actually in the rack and\nit's running right now\n\n221\n00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.310\neven though I stole this power\nsupply out of it right before that.\n\n222\n00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.170\nI told you people were gonna be mad at me.\n\n223\n00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.220\nThis is one case where they won't.\n\n224\n00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.200\nI went into the server room and\n\n225\n00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.150\nsnagged this right out of\nthe server while it was running.\n\n226\n00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.570\nIt's got the purple handle, so I knew it\nwas not pluggable and I yanked it out.\n\n227\n00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.530\nThat server's still running fine.\n\n228\n00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:23.400\nWhat happens is the two power\nsupplies run at 50% utilization.\n\n229\n00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.580\nThey're 400 watt power supplies.\n\n230\n00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.690\nEach one was probably\nrunning at 200 watts.\n\n231\n00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.829\nAnd when I yanked one out, the other\none just [SOUND] ramped up to 400 and\n\n232\n00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:30.768\nthe server's fine.\n\n233\n00:11:30.768 --> 00:11:33.050\nIt doesn't even have\na red light on the front.\n\n234\n00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.370\nIt's just sitting there cruising\nalthough it might have its\n\n235\n00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:39.270\nUID light on which sometimes makes\nthe warning light not show up.\n\n236\n00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.660\nBut anyhow, I can go pop this\nback in after the show and\n\n237\n00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.720\nnobody will be the wiser except for\nyou guys who I've now confessed to.\n\n238\n00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.340\nThat's redundancy.\n\n239\n00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.130\nTo an extent, right?\n\n240\n00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:54.480\nThis protects me from myself, apparently,\nbut also a power supply failing.\n\n241\n00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.360\nIf this power supply were to take a surge\nand die or just it reaches it's lifetime.\n\n242\n00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.920\nInside of these power\nsupplies are capacitors.\n\n243\n00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.510\nAnd if there's one thing we've learned\nover the last ten years is that\n\n244\n00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.570\nthe factories where they make these\ncapacitors they don't have the highest\n\n245\n00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:06.580\nquality control.\n\n246\n00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.230\nAnd so, the capacitor will eventually\nfail, the power supply fails.\n\n247\n00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:14.530\nWhen that happens if you've only got one\npower supply your server goes offline.\n\n248\n00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.580\nNow sometimes we care about\nthat sometimes we don't.\n\n249\n00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.350\nBefore the show Wes and\nI were talking Google's data centers and\n\n250\n00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:22.250\nI was telling him that they\nhave thousands of servers.\n\n251\n00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.000\nAnd we have thousands of servers,\nthat's not accurate.\n\n252\n00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.330\nThey have hundreds of\nthousands of servers but\n\n253\n00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.140\nin an individual container they'll\nhave thousands of servers.\n\n254\n00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:34.470\nAnd when you have that many servers\nif a power supply fails and\n\n255\n00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.690\na server goes offline, if I had 1,000,\nnow I have 999, I'm probably okay.\n\n256\n00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.650\nYou've got redundancy of scale there,\nso you don't care about it,\n\n257\n00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.540\nyou don't do redundant power supplies.\n\n258\n00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.190\nBut if you're a small business and this\nserver is powering everything you've got,\n\n259\n00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.630\nthen you need redundant power supplies.\n\n260\n00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.820\nAnd that way if one fails, the server\nstays online and it keeps working.\n\n261\n00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.820\nBut what are those power\nsupplies plugged into?\n\n262\n00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.260\nIf both those power supplies is\nrunning to the same wall socket,\n\n263\n00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.130\nthen they're on the same circuit.\n\n264\n00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:04.500\nAnd if that circuit trips,\nboth power supplies lose their power.\n\n265\n00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.820\nOr if they're run to the same UPS.\n\n266\n00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.230\nAnd the UPS fails.\n\n267\n00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.860\nWell then you lose power right, so\n\n268\n00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.150\nif we want true redundancy it's\ngot to go beyond our servers.\n\n269\n00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.856\nDell used to set up these cables, I hated\nthem, we call them sneaked tongue cables.\n\n270\n00:13:18.856 --> 00:13:22.902\nThey were power cables that had a three\npronged outlet on one side, and\n\n271\n00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:26.478\nthen it forked out into two D\nplugs to plug in the power supply.\n\n272\n00:13:26.478 --> 00:13:30.663\nAnd yes that protects you in case a power\nsupply fails but if your circuit trips, or\n\n273\n00:13:30.663 --> 00:13:34.130\nthe UPS you're plugged into runs\nout of battery or whatever.\n\n274\n00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:37.780\nThen you got an outage, you don't have\nredundancy beyond the power supply.\n\n275\n00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:43.120\nSo ideally, if you have two power\nsupplies, they run to different PDUs.\n\n276\n00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.920\nPDUs are power distribution units or\npower strips.\n\n277\n00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.380\nTwo different power strips, and\n\n278\n00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.840\nthose power strips run to\ntwo different circuits.\n\n279\n00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.210\nAnd then those circuits run out and\nget you your power.\n\n280\n00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.290\nThat way, if one circuit trips,\nthe other circuit's still active,\n\n281\n00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.000\nwe still get our power.\n\n282\n00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.570\nOr if somebody brings up a new server and\n\n283\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.750\none circuit gets oversubscribed, we can\nstill draw power from the other one.\n\n284\n00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.490\nIf we have two different UPSs,\none UPS could fail.\n\n285\n00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:10.690\nOr the battery could die, or whatever,\nthe other UPS is up and running.\n\n286\n00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.240\nBut balancing that infrastructure out,\n\n287\n00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:18.340\nnow we get true redundancy beyond just\nthe physical power supply in the server.\n\n288\n00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.980\nAnd we always need to think about that.\n\n289\n00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.840\nIf you have multiple servers\nthat are all doing the same job,\n\n290\n00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.790\nyou might not need that,\nyou don't care if one fails.\n\n291\n00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.830\nBut you never want multiple devices\nall dependent on the same resource.\n\n292\n00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.310\nIf they're all on the same power circuit\n\n293\n00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.440\nlosing that one circuit\ncould down all your servers.\n\n294\n00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.310\nAnd usually the draw is too high anyway.\n\n295\n00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:39.060\nSo if you look at like our racks behind\nus, each rack has it's own circuit.\n\n296\n00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:44.018\nAt the bottom of each rack is a little\nquad outlet and it's got it's own circuit.\n\n297\n00:14:44.018 --> 00:14:46.630\nAnd our UPSs are spread out\nacross the four racks and\n\n298\n00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.220\nour servers are spread out\nbetween the four racks.\n\n299\n00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.160\nAnd that way we get that redundancy\nacross the power circuit.\n\n300\n00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.150\n&gt;&gt; Don, you mention that term UPS there,\nas you know, acronym heaven with me,\n\n301\n00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.060\nuninterruptible power supplies.\n\n302\n00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.480\nNow if I plug my server and\nboth power supplies into one UPS and\n\n303\n00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.300\nmaybe we've done redundant UPSs,\nis that enough?\n\n304\n00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.170\nI mean, power goes off, UPSs trigger,\nall I gotta do is wait for\n\n305\n00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.550\nthe power to come back on, right?\n\n306\n00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:14.000\n&gt;&gt; Well, it depends on your level\nof urgency and your criticality.\n\n307\n00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.890\nIf you're a dentist office,\nthat's probably fine.\n\n308\n00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.380\nBut let's say you're running\nthe data center for a hospital.\n\n309\n00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.750\nAnd if your servers go offline,\n\n310\n00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:26.480\nyour nurses can't issue\nmedication to your patients.\n\n311\n00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.020\nThat's not good, right?\n\n312\n00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.850\nThat's not something we want.\n\n313\n00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:31.010\nOr maybe your x-ray and\n\n314\n00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.610\ndiagnostics machines are not able\nto do what they're supposed to do.\n\n315\n00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.910\nCuz your servers are down.\n\n316\n00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.680\nYou can't afford that down time, so\n\n317\n00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.790\nyou need a level of redundancy\nthat goes beyond that.\n\n318\n00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.690\nI've said this before and\nI'll say it again, UPSs,\n\n319\n00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:48.203\nUninterruptible Power Supplies, are not\ndesigned to keep your servers online for\n\n320\n00:15:48.203 --> 00:15:49.309\nany length of time.\n\n321\n00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:52.000\nThey're really designed\nto keep in online for\n\n322\n00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.381\njust a brief period of time\nwhile your generators fire up.\n\n323\n00:15:55.381 --> 00:15:59.491\nIf I have just my laptop plugged into a\nUPS, I might be able to run for two hours.\n\n324\n00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:01.941\nBut servers draw a lot of power.\n\n325\n00:16:01.941 --> 00:16:04.210\nThey draw a lot of current.\n\n326\n00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.780\nAnd that means they're gonna\nburn that UPS down really fast.\n\n327\n00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:07.572\nNot fire.\nSorry.\n\n328\n00:16:07.572 --> 00:16:10.020\nThey're gonna drain the UPS battery very,\nvery fast.\n\n329\n00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.290\nIt's better terminology.\n\n330\n00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.810\nAnd that means that I might\nget five minutes, ten minutes.\n\n331\n00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.260\nIf I dump a ton of money\ninto my UPS infrastructure,\n\n332\n00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.100\nmaybe I can get 15 minutes out of it.\n\n333\n00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.740\nWell, that's not very long.\n\n334\n00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.330\nIs the power gonna come\nback in 15 minutes?\n\n335\n00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.560\nMaybe.\n\n336\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.970\nBut if I have generators, generators can\nturn on in under 15 minutes, can't they?\n\n337\n00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.180\nAnd notice how I always\nsay generators plural.\n\n338\n00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.980\nI never just say, a generator,\ncuz if you're gonna go to that expense,\n\n339\n00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.410\nyou buy two of the darn things.\n\n340\n00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.640\nBecause they're usually diesel, which\nmeans they've gotta be manually cranked or\n\n341\n00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.990\nyou can have them automatic, but\nthey still have to crank up.\n\n342\n00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:42.463\nAnd it's possible they don't start, right?\n\n343\n00:16:42.463 --> 00:16:45.259\nMaybe there's a little bit of corrosion\non the spark plug or glow plug.\n\n344\n00:16:45.259 --> 00:16:47.590\nSorry, they don't use\nspark plugs to fire up.\n\n345\n00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.230\nMaybe I'm out of fuel in one.\n\n346\n00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:50.585\nSo you have two.\n\n347\n00:16:50.585 --> 00:16:52.810\nAnd there's maintenance that has\nto be done on those generators.\n\n348\n00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:56.430\nThey need to be started up once a week or\nonce every other week because otherwise,\n\n349\n00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.050\nthat diesel fuel starts to gel.\n\n350\n00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.100\nSo you got a whole maintenance\nroutine to go through on those, but\n\n351\n00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.570\nyou need redundancy on the generators too.\n\n352\n00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:06.581\n&gt;&gt; Don, I also noticed something that you\nkeep mentioning over and over, repetitive.\n\n353\n00:17:06.581 --> 00:17:09.504\nAnd that's the term diesel generator.\n\n354\n00:17:09.504 --> 00:17:14.320\nOne thing I noticed that you haven't\nmentioned is a gasoline-based generator.\n\n355\n00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.420\nI used to paint, and\n\n356\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:19.520\nsometimes there wouldn't be a electrical\npole on a job site that we had.\n\n357\n00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.450\nSo we'd plug into a gasoline generator.\n\n358\n00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:23.710\nWhy haven't you been\nmentioning gasoline generator?\n\n359\n00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.040\n&gt;&gt; Well, so there's a couple of\nthings about gasoline generators.\n\n360\n00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.150\nGasoline generators are normally cheaper.\n\n361\n00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.810\nThey're normally smaller, right, so\nthey're not usually the big giant ones\n\n362\n00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:34.410\nthat are out there because diesel\nfuel is more efficient, right?\n\n363\n00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.580\nThat's why semi trucks,\n\n364\n00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.810\nthe big trucks that are moving freight\nacross the country, they're all diesel.\n\n365\n00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.290\nBecause diesel is more efficient.\n\n366\n00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.350\nIf you're gonna be running\nover a long period of time,\n\n367\n00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.190\nif you're gonna start a motor up and\nrun it for\n\n368\n00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:50.660\ndays on end, you'll get more efficiency\nout of diesel fuel than you will gas.\n\n369\n00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:54.770\nDiesel also stays a little better.\n\n370\n00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.280\nStay's not the right word.\n\n371\n00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.776\nIf gas sits for too long, or just regular,\n\n372\n00:17:59.776 --> 00:18:04.840\nethanol-based gasoline,\nthen it starts to spoil, right?\n\n373\n00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.870\nIt goes bad after awhile.\n\n374\n00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:10.085\nDiesel can stay a lot\nlonger without spoiling.\n\n375\n00:18:10.085 --> 00:18:13.114\nAs long as you crank up the engine and let\nit run a little bit every now and then to\n\n376\n00:18:13.114 --> 00:18:16.710\nstop it from gelling, then diesel fuel\ncan actually stay around for a long time.\n\n377\n00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.300\n&gt;&gt; Now I'm gonna also ask a question\nabout maybe an urban legend.\n\n378\n00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.000\nMaybe this is all myth, but\nwith the gasoline generators,\n\n379\n00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.050\ndon't they have too much power\nfluctuation for traditional computers?\n\n380\n00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.303\nDo the diesel generators have\nmore of a clean even power?\n\n381\n00:18:29.303 --> 00:18:33.442\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it depends on how well\nthe equipment is maintained, right?\n\n382\n00:18:33.442 --> 00:18:37.340\nA properly maintained gas generator\ncan actually do a really good job.\n\n383\n00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.100\nBut you have to remember how\nthings are combusting and\n\n384\n00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.780\nI don't wanna go into\na crazy physics lesson,\n\n385\n00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.030\nbut know that with a gas\ngenerator you have a spark plug.\n\n386\n00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.230\nIt generates a little spark and\n\n387\n00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:47.850\nit ignites the gas in the piston\nchamber to move a piston.\n\n388\n00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.220\nWell, that spark sometimes misses.\n\n389\n00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.200\nAnd you hear that sometimes in the vehicle\nthat's running a little rough, or you hear\n\n390\n00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.830\na backfire, those kinds of things,\nthat can be caused by the spark plugs.\n\n391\n00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:00.720\nDiesel engines use glow plugs instead.\n\n392\n00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.830\nIt's a little metal nub that heats up and\n\n393\n00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.060\nmaintains a constant\nheat to ignite the fuel.\n\n394\n00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.910\nSo it's much more\nconsistent at combusting.\n\n395\n00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.320\nAnd so\nthat's where that opinion comes from.\n\n396\n00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.200\nBut a properly maintained gas generator\ncan provide the same quality, or\n\n397\n00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.362\nat least as far as I'm aware.\n\n398\n00:19:16.362 --> 00:19:19.520\nAll right,\nnow lets take redundancy to the extreme.\n\n399\n00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.860\nLet's say you're in a real data center.\n\n400\n00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:26.930\nYou're in Atlanta or up in Washington DC,\nin one of the big areas,\n\n401\n00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.080\nwhere you're at an Internet\nbackbone crossroads.\n\n402\n00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.800\nYou work for Google, or\nFacebook, or Microsoft,\n\n403\n00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.430\none of those companies that\nhas massive data centers.\n\n404\n00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:39.970\nWell, redundant generators are great, but\nthey're only gonna last you a couple of\n\n405\n00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.080\ndays tops, right,\nbefore you start running out of fuel.\n\n406\n00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.050\nAnd if you're in a true crisis you\nmight not be able to get more fuel.\n\n407\n00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.887\nSo, how do you get redundancy beyond that?\n\n408\n00:19:48.887 --> 00:19:52.934\nAnd the highest level of\nredundancy you can get is to have\n\n409\n00:19:52.934 --> 00:19:57.847\nthe redundant power supplies,\nredundant UPSs, redundant PDUs,\n\n410\n00:19:57.847 --> 00:20:01.750\nredundant generators, and\nredundant power grids.\n\n411\n00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.919\nPower grids, that's a big deal because\nmost cities have a power grid monopoly.\n\n412\n00:20:04.919 --> 00:20:07.340\nLike here in Gainesville we have GRU.\n\n413\n00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.497\nGRU is the only provider of power\nhere in Gainesville, and that's it.\n\n414\n00:20:10.497 --> 00:20:13.670\nSo, if I get power that's who I get it\nfrom, I have no other choices, right?\n\n415\n00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.890\nYou can do solar or wind, but that's\nnot consistent enough to run a server.\n\n416\n00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:17.900\nSo, you store that in a battery.\n\n417\n00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.430\nIt's effectively a UPS.\n\n418\n00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:24.100\nBut with power grids,\nif you're in of one those larger areas,\n\n419\n00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.360\nthey will have more than one\nprovider that you can bring into.\n\n420\n00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.650\nSo you can bring in legs from\nthose two different providers.\n\n421\n00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:31.540\nIn an area like Gainesville\nwhere you have one provider,\n\n422\n00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.120\nyou can still bring in more than one leg,\nit's just coming from one provider.\n\n423\n00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.920\nAnd so it's not uncommon for\n\n424\n00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.880\na large building to have\nthree legs that run into it.\n\n425\n00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.510\nAnd that's three different connections\nthat'll run back three different ways to\n\n426\n00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:47.610\nget to the main power transformers for\nthat company and draw the power from them.\n\n427\n00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:52.110\nIf one leg goes down, you're fine because\nyour other two are still up and going.\n\n428\n00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:56.380\nAnd so you can go fully redundant on that\nwhere you got a set of generators on each,\n\n429\n00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.680\nset of UPSs, set of PDUs,\n\n430\n00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.700\nyour circuits are all divided up on\ntwo completely different power grids.\n\n431\n00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:02.802\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was gonna ask there.\n\n432\n00:21:02.802 --> 00:21:06.982\nThe question was, is it a single grid that\nthey have multiple connections or you go\n\n433\n00:21:06.982 --> 00:21:11.250\neven farther than that, you got multiple\nconnections to multiple power grids.\n\n434\n00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:15.247\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can kinda go either way,\nbut multiple is the best, right?\n\n435\n00:21:15.247 --> 00:21:16.641\nYou divide it up all up\ncompletely separate,\n\n436\n00:21:16.641 --> 00:21:18.670\nbut you guys can probably start\nseeing the dollar signs, right?\n\n437\n00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.910\nThis is getting more and more expensive\nas we talk about these technologies.\n\n438\n00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:25.030\nBut if you're running critical\ninfrastructure, that cost is\n\n439\n00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.880\na drop in the bucket cuz what would happen\nif you weren't able to provide services?\n\n440\n00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.610\nIf people could die,\nthat's a pretty high cost.\n\n441\n00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:35.500\nAnd so you would go with the cost\nof putting infrastructure in place.\n\n442\n00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.390\nOne of the reasons we bought this\nbuilding, the ITProTV studio building,\n\n443\n00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:43.570\nthis used to be a central office for\na cellular company.\n\n444\n00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.760\nAnd they had a cellular tower right here,\nand\n\n445\n00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.400\nthey were a Tier 1 restoration service.\n\n446\n00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.970\nSo if there was ever a power outage\nin town they were one of the first\n\n447\n00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.180\nlocations that were brought back up\nbecause it was communications, right?\n\n448\n00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:59.090\nAnd so while normally for us if we were\nto build a building we'd be lucky to get\n\n449\n00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:01.440\nthree legs, this building has nine legs.\n\n450\n00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.510\nAnd we do just have the one grid,\nbut is nine different links into it.\n\n451\n00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:10.850\nAnd that means that if we lose power\nit's gotta big a pretty big outage for\n\n452\n00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:12.100\nus to really lose it.\n\n453\n00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:15.720\nOtherwise we would just lose\nprobably three legs out of the nine.\n\n454\n00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.807\nSo it's neat, the different kind\nof considerations you have there.\n\n455\n00:22:20.807 --> 00:22:23.816\nNormally these are decisions that\nare being made by electricians, so\n\n456\n00:22:23.816 --> 00:22:25.350\nwhy do we need to know?\n\n457\n00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.400\nBecause if we're the ones\nracking up the services,\n\n458\n00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.950\nwe need to know what we're plugging into.\n\n459\n00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.710\nAnd you can ask the electrician, hey, I've\ngot these servers under these two strips,\n\n460\n00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:33.290\nare they running in different circuits?\n\n461\n00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.400\nOkay, how much amperage do\nI have on each circuit?\n\n462\n00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.170\nIs this 20 amp, 30 amp,\n40 amp, what do I have?\n\n463\n00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:41.160\nWhat load can I pull on\nthis before I trip it?\n\n464\n00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.060\nAnd then,\nare these run to different grids?\n\n465\n00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.150\nAre these run to different loops, or\nhow about those generators, right?\n\n466\n00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.520\nWhat outlets are on what generators?\n\n467\n00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.790\nWe need to know to ask these questions to\nbe able to get everything arranged right,\n\n468\n00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:56.050\nor if we're participating in the design,\nthese are topics we need to bring up so\n\n469\n00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.990\nthat the electricians can\nstart to plan around it and\n\n470\n00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.140\nget things designed the way\nthat we need for efficiency.\n\n471\n00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:06.780\nAll right, let's move on to something that\nI kinda led the last episode with and\n\n472\n00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.420\nabandoned, which were the plug types.\n\n473\n00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:14.451\nI held up an example in the last\nepisode of a three-prong power plug.\n\n474\n00:23:14.451 --> 00:23:16.880\nAnd there are many different\npower plugs that are out there.\n\n475\n00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.808\nThis is just a common example that\nwe use with consumer devices.\n\n476\n00:23:19.808 --> 00:23:22.335\nIt's not too terribly fancy but\n\n477\n00:23:22.335 --> 00:23:25.570\nit's something that most of us\nare used to here in the United States.\n\n478\n00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:29.040\nOutside of the United States things get\ncrazy, all sorts of different connectors.\n\n479\n00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.600\nThe two circular connector one\nis probably the most common.\n\n480\n00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.520\nYou've got ones in Australia where\nthey got diagonal connectors.\n\n481\n00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.050\nThere's all sorts of different ones that\nare out there based on your country.\n\n482\n00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.020\nUnfortunately for\n\n483\n00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.900\nthose of you not in the US the exam\nis based on US power standards.\n\n484\n00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.104\nSo all the plugs you're gonna see on the\nexam are ones that we used right here in\n\n485\n00:23:47.104 --> 00:23:47.958\nthe United States.\n\n486\n00:23:47.958 --> 00:23:50.619\nAnd in the United States,\nwe have an organization,\n\n487\n00:23:50.619 --> 00:23:54.975\nthe National Electrical Manufacturers\nAssociation, or NEMA, and NEMA has defined\n\n488\n00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:58.802\na numbering system to identify all\nthe different outlet types that we use.\n\n489\n00:23:58.802 --> 00:24:03.003\nSo, when you go into a data center and\nyou ask an electrician, hey,\n\n490\n00:24:03.003 --> 00:24:06.470\nI need a 240 volt outlet for\nmy server rack.\n\n491\n00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.860\nAnd they'll say okay,\nwhat type of plug do you want?\n\n492\n00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.960\nWhat they're expecting you to\nsay is I need a NEMA 515, or\n\n493\n00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.970\nsomething crazy like that.\n\n494\n00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:17.190\nThey're not expecting you to say, I don't\nknow, the one with two holes in it.\n\n495\n00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.160\nThey need to know exactly\nwhich one to put in.\n\n496\n00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:24.780\nAnd so, for us to understand those\nNEMA plugs is a really good thing.\n\n497\n00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.640\nIn other countries, you need to find out\nwho it is that defines the outlets in your\n\n498\n00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.862\ncountry, and make sure that you get the\nright ones, but in the US, we have NEMA.\n\n499\n00:24:30.862 --> 00:24:32.220\n&gt;&gt; And that's,\nthat was going to be my question.\n\n500\n00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:36.730\nSo, you have the IEEE,\nwe have ISOC, ISO, even though that\n\n501\n00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:40.370\na lot of the work's done here in the US,\nit is an international standard.\n\n502\n00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.150\nYou're saying NEMA here is gonna\nbe something that is regional.\n\n503\n00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.030\nIt's gonna be just here\nin the United States.\n\n504\n00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.030\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nI believe it is just in the United States.\n\n505\n00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.740\nEven Canada has their own governing body,\n\n506\n00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.340\nalthough I think Canada does use\nall the same outlets that we do.\n\n507\n00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.935\nThere are other countries out there\nthat just use the same outlets we do,\n\n508\n00:24:53.935 --> 00:24:56.550\ncuz we helped in creating\ntheir infrastructure.\n\n509\n00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:00.150\nBut many, many countries did it without\nus getting involved at all, and\n\n510\n00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.200\nthey created different plugs.\n\n511\n00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.350\nPlugs that often times are better, right?\n\n512\n00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:07.650\nJust because we did ours early\non doesn't make ours any better.\n\n513\n00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:10.470\nThere's other ones that are out\nthere that actually arrange better,\n\n514\n00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:12.777\nit's just we've set our own standard and\nstuck with it.\n\n515\n00:25:12.777 --> 00:25:17.891\n&gt;&gt; Don, I've heard this term thrown around\nhere, and it confuses me at time before,\n\n516\n00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:22.877\nI've never heard of a Tesla plug, but\nI've definitely heard of an Edison plug.\n\n517\n00:25:22.877 --> 00:25:23.690\nCan you help me out with that?\n\n518\n00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.030\nWhat are we looking at when\nwe look at an Edison plug?\n\n519\n00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:26.980\n&gt;&gt; You hear people say that a lot,\n\n520\n00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:30.570\nwhere you hear people say I\nneed a standard Edison plug.\n\n521\n00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:34.370\nAnd that's not a NEMA term,\nthere's actually a NEMA name for it.\n\n522\n00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:37.770\nBut Edison, that's just what we\ncall our regular old wall jack.\n\n523\n00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:40.570\nSo when you look at the wall,\nthat's, in the US,\n\n524\n00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:42.170\nthat's what we call an Edison plug.\n\n525\n00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:45.320\nWell, the problem with that terminology is\nthat there's two different types of Edison\n\n526\n00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.210\nplugs these days.\n\n527\n00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.110\nThere's ones that are just two prong, and\nthere's ones that are three prong, right,\n\n528\n00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:51.030\nthe ones that have a ground and\nthe ones that don't.\n\n529\n00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:52.900\nWell, in any new construction,\n\n530\n00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.170\nyou're gonna have three prong,\neverything grounded.\n\n531\n00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:58.470\nBut in old construction,\nyou may still have two prong.\n\n532\n00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:01.840\nNow, if you're in a data center,\nthat all needs to be redone.\n\n533\n00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.690\nRight, you need to tear that wire out and\nget it rerun.\n\n534\n00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:05.150\nIf you see a two prong, that's a problem,\n\n535\n00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.170\nthat's not good infrastructure for\nservers.\n\n536\n00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.290\nSo, in the server room,\nwe don't worry about it.\n\n537\n00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:13.085\nBut out and about in other areas,\nyou might still have two, and\n\n538\n00:26:13.085 --> 00:26:14.235\nstill be using it.\n\n539\n00:26:14.235 --> 00:26:15.175\nAnd that can be problematic.\n\n540\n00:26:15.175 --> 00:26:17.345\nYou're not really gonna be able\nto put good servers there.\n\n541\n00:26:17.345 --> 00:26:20.280\nIt's just not, you need to have\nthose grounded connections.\n\n542\n00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:24.205\nUPS's get super ticked off if you try\nto feed two-prong power into them.\n\n543\n00:26:24.205 --> 00:26:27.015\nBut if we look at all the NEMA plugs,\nI'll bring up here in just a minute,\n\n544\n00:26:27.015 --> 00:26:29.930\nI'll show you which one is\ntechnically the Edison plug.\n\n545\n00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:34.080\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, if I need, let's say that I\nhave a plug that needs a little bit more\n\n546\n00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:38.920\ndurability, maybe it's around some\nkind of, I don't know, plant or\n\n547\n00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.900\nsomething where there's vibration.\n\n548\n00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.510\nDo we have, I know these regular plugs,\n\n549\n00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.720\nI've noticed that they maybe\nhave the potential to work their\n\n550\n00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.590\nway out of the socket, do we have a way\naround that, as far as plug types?\n\n551\n00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:53.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot of variations\non the plug types I'm gonna show you.\n\n552\n00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.660\nOne of the variations out there is\nwhat is called a twist lock, and\n\n553\n00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:58.960\nwith twist lock plugs,\nyou see this a lot with UPS's\n\n554\n00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.110\nwhere you don't want the UPS\nto come unplugged by accident.\n\n555\n00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.010\nSomebody trips over a cable,\nand yanks it out.\n\n556\n00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:03.830\nShouldn't happen anyway,\n\n557\n00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:06.790\ncuz the outlet should be under\nthe sub-floor but, if it does happen.\n\n558\n00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:11.790\nSo, you'll take a typical outlet,\na normal type plug, and\n\n559\n00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:14.430\nthey make variations that occur,\nand let me bring up this chart.\n\n560\n00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:18.720\nThere's a chart that is\npart of Wiki Media, it's,\n\n561\n00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.420\nthe URL is right here on the screen so\nyou guys can see it.\n\n562\n00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.740\nI'll put the link in the show notes, also.\n\n563\n00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.940\nBut they made this chart that shows\nall the different outlet types.\n\n564\n00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.270\nAnd our standard outlet,\n\n565\n00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.700\nwhat we would call an Edison plug,\nis this guy right here.\n\n566\n00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.900\nRight, so I got the two blades, and\n\n567\n00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.540\nthe one post right here\nthat I would plug into.\n\n568\n00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.130\nAnd you see where we got the neutral and\nthe hot.\n\n569\n00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.580\nAnd then we've got the ground right there.\n\n570\n00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.862\nBut there's a variation,\nlike this guy right here,\n\n571\n00:27:43.862 --> 00:27:46.910\nin [INAUDIBLE] it's still three blades or\nstill three prongs.\n\n572\n00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:48.680\nBut they're kind of curved.\n\n573\n00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.430\nThey're curved to create a circle.\n\n574\n00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:53.660\nBecause these guys actually have\na little hook on each prong, so\n\n575\n00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:57.180\nyou can plug it in and twist it,\nand it locks in place.\n\n576\n00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:57.920\nAnd then if you tug it,\n\n577\n00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:02.280\nno matter how hard you tug, the cable will\nbreak before the outlet comes out, right?\n\n578\n00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:06.690\nSo, twist lock is very common with\nUPS's where you plug them in, and\n\n579\n00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.030\nyou don't want them to come out.\n\n580\n00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:11.240\nIt's not common with the these D plug\ntype cables that come right off our\n\n581\n00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:11.850\npower supplies.\n\n582\n00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:14.260\nThese are normally just\nregular pronged connections.\n\n583\n00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.920\nBut on UPS's, you'll see these.\n\n584\n00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.666\nAnd so, if you look at it,\nwe've got NEMA 5-15.\n\n585\n00:28:18.666 --> 00:28:21.750\nThat's what we consider\nan Edison plug these days.\n\n586\n00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:26.130\nAnd then you've got NEMA L5-15,\ntechnically the same, but\n\n587\n00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:28.550\narranged to be able to lock\nwith a twisting motion.\n\n588\n00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.370\nSo, those two are really common.\n\n589\n00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:34.546\nBut notice how the list is 120 volt AC,\nright?\n\n590\n00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:35.266\nAt 120 VAC.\n\n591\n00:28:35.266 --> 00:28:40.910\nThere's other variations for when we\npush more voltage, or more amperage.\n\n592\n00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.800\nWhen you start getting into 20 amp,\n30 amp, and\n\n593\n00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.560\n50 amp connectors they\nmove to different plugs.\n\n594\n00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.030\nAnd the main reason here is, they're\ntrying to make sure we don't confuse\n\n595\n00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:53.940\nthings and plug a high voltage item\ninto a low voltage plug, or vice versa.\n\n596\n00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:59.582\nSo, you'll see here that 120 item,\nthis particular blade is nice and big.\n\n597\n00:28:59.582 --> 00:29:03.090\nAnd then when you get over to the 20 amp\nversion, that blade gets a little smaller.\n\n598\n00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:05.210\nAnd the 30 ampoule blade\ngets even smaller.\n\n599\n00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:09.510\nSo, I can't plug the wrong device\ninto the wrong type of outlet,\n\n600\n00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.940\nI need to make sure\nI've got the right one.\n\n601\n00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.870\nWhich goes back to the whole, we need\nto know what to tell the electricians.\n\n602\n00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:15.500\nWe need to know the numbering.\n\n603\n00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.088\nIf you're buying a server,\na UPS, or whatever,\n\n604\n00:29:18.088 --> 00:29:22.096\nyou can pull the technical specifications,\nand it'll have it in there, and\n\n605\n00:29:22.096 --> 00:29:24.703\nit'll usually have the NEMA\ndesignation for it.\n\n606\n00:29:24.703 --> 00:29:28.171\nYou'll see other ones like this one,\nwhere it's got a variation where you might\n\n607\n00:29:28.171 --> 00:29:31.594\nhave a vertical blade, or a horizontal\nblade, and so that accepts either one.\n\n608\n00:29:31.594 --> 00:29:36.540\nAnd then a vertical blade\nhere in the ground post.\n\n609\n00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.800\nWhen we start getting into 240 though,\nyou'll start to see the outlets\n\n610\n00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:44.200\nget larger, so they're physically larger,\nand have a different form of vector.\n\n611\n00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:50.080\nAgain, to stop you from plugging in a 120\ndevice into a 240 outlet, or whatever.\n\n612\n00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.790\nAnd so now things start to get\na little bit on E, the confusing side.\n\n613\n00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:56.930\nBut again, each one here is\nbasically gauged on the amperage.\n\n614\n00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:01.460\nAnd notice how we've got this NEMA 5-15,\n\n615\n00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.590\nthat second number, the 15,\nmatches the amperage.\n\n616\n00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:09.630\nNEMA 5-20, 20 amps, NEMA 5-30, 30 amps,\nsame thing goes for the two 40s.\n\n617\n00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:13.460\nSo when I have a NEMA 6-20, that's 20\namps, or a NEMA 6-30, 30 that's amps,\n\n618\n00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.790\nand so on.\n\n619\n00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.660\nAnd so,\nthese are the appropriate plugs for that.\n\n620\n00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.510\nSome of these have a lot of thought put\ninto the design, like the diagonal blades.\n\n621\n00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:25.410\nDiagonal blades actually help stop\nthe cord from falling out of the wall.\n\n622\n00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:29.680\nIf you have just vertical blades,\nyou can fall right out of the wall, right?\n\n623\n00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.680\nSo, there's gotta be little copper\npads that put pressure on the plug\n\n624\n00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.640\nto hold it in.\n\n625\n00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.770\nWell, the older a plug gets,\nthe looser those get.\n\n626\n00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.420\nHave you ever had that where\nyou plug in something,\n\n627\n00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.540\nand the cable just falls\nright out of the outlet?\n\n628\n00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:43.240\nYou see that at hotels a lot, where people\njust constantly plug in and unplug things.\n\n629\n00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.460\nBut with the diagonal blades, you plug\nsomething in, and if they try and fall\n\n630\n00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:50.810\nout, they're diagonals, they kind of hold\nthemselves in place a little bit better.\n\n631\n00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:54.380\nSo, you'll see that on some\nof the higher voltage ones.\n\n632\n00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.040\nYou'll also notice how some of these\nare what I would call upside down,\n\n633\n00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.700\nwhere the ground is up top.\n\n634\n00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.020\nNormally, the ground is on the bottom,\nright?\n\n635\n00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:02.360\nBut these have the ground up top.\n\n636\n00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:06.060\nAnd that's done because if you have\na metal faceplate, and the metal faceplate\n\n637\n00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:11.340\nwere to fall off and come down,\nif the two hotlines were up here,\n\n638\n00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:14.310\nright, the hot and the neutral,\nthat metal faceplate would fall and\n\n639\n00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:18.355\ncontact these two and cause a spark and\npotentially cause a fire, right?\n\n640\n00:31:18.355 --> 00:31:22.390\nWell, in a home, we normally use plastic\nfaceplates, so that's not going to happen.\n\n641\n00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.900\nBut in a data center, you'll normally have\nmetal faceplates, and if they fall and\n\n642\n00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.410\nhit that, it would be a problem.\n\n643\n00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:30.260\nSo, the higher amperage ones\nare usually upside down, so\n\n644\n00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.370\nwhen the metal faceplate falls,\nit just hits the ground.\n\n645\n00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:37.320\nAnd that's it, it's this ground line,\nand it doesn't complete a circuit.\n\n646\n00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.650\nAnd there's no problem, Frank,\n\n647\n00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:41.130\nso that's why some of them are upside\ndown versus upside, right?\n\n648\n00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:44.090\nIt's not technically upside down,\nit's just a different arrangement.\n\n649\n00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:47.610\nSo, you'll see several different\nones that are laid out here, and\n\n650\n00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.430\nyou can cheat the system.\n\n651\n00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:53.780\nYou can have a NEMA 515,\nthat's 240, I have seen it.\n\n652\n00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.005\nYou're not supposed to, though.\n\n653\n00:31:55.005 --> 00:31:59.644\nMost electricians won't do that, because\nof the risk of plugging something in and\n\n654\n00:31:59.644 --> 00:32:00.781\ndoing some damage.\n\n655\n00:32:00.781 --> 00:32:02.813\nLower voltage is safer.\n\n656\n00:32:02.813 --> 00:32:06.410\nI personally have been\nshocked by a 120 volt outlet.\n\n657\n00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:09.630\nIt's not pleasant, but it didn't kill\nme and there's no lasting damage.\n\n658\n00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:12.060\n240?\nYou can get really hurt.\n\n659\n00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:16.120\nYou can carry a higher amperage on that\nline, and you can really hurt yourself.\n\n660\n00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:21.270\nWhen you start getting into the really big\nones like 208 or the 440 and 460, 480.\n\n661\n00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:24.381\nYou can change your life or\nend your life with one of those, so\n\n662\n00:32:24.381 --> 00:32:26.519\nyou really have to be careful with those.\n\n663\n00:32:26.519 --> 00:32:31.262\n&gt;&gt; Now Don we've been talking about 90%\nthese last two parts of this episode\n\n664\n00:32:31.262 --> 00:32:33.390\nhere have been about power.\n\n665\n00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:36.465\nSo, let's go ahead and we'll keep\nit consistent with CompTia here.\n\n666\n00:32:36.465 --> 00:32:38.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And let's talk about cooling.\n\n667\n00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.570\nNow I know in another episode,\nyou kinda broke open the server and\n\n668\n00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.310\nwe got to see some kind of\nthe beginnings of cooling, but\n\n669\n00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.900\nwe really didn't go into\nit in too much depth.\n\n670\n00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.980\nCan you help us out with this one?\n\n671\n00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:50.640\n&gt;&gt; All right, so cooling is actually\nin three different places in the exam\n\n672\n00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.180\nobjectives.\n\n673\n00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:55.340\nAnd this is probably the most\nunusual place in this episode.\n\n674\n00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.840\nSo, I'm gonna keep it short here.\n\n675\n00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.440\nIf you go back to our server components\nepisode, I took apart a server, and\n\n676\n00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.750\nI showed you how the airflow works\nin that server to keep things cool.\n\n677\n00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:05.450\nParts of which being cooled\nis the power supply.\n\n678\n00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.510\nMost power supplies have\na fun inside of them.\n\n679\n00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:10.660\nOr there's fans as a part of the system.\n\n680\n00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.770\nThis one actually does have a little\nfan right down here under this grid.\n\n681\n00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:15.940\nSo that it's drawing power\nthrough the power supply.\n\n682\n00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.560\nThe capacitors inside of it can\nget a little warm sometimes.\n\n683\n00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.960\nAnd as they build up electricity.\n\n684\n00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.150\nAnd if the server is really cranking.\n\n685\n00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:23.964\nSo they need to be cooled,\njust like anything else.\n\n686\n00:33:25.532 --> 00:33:29.162\nSo we talked about it there, I showed\nthe and how air flow moves through, and\n\n687\n00:33:29.162 --> 00:33:30.820\nthe shrouds, and all that good stuff.\n\n688\n00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.080\nIt's all right in the server\ncomponents episode.\n\n689\n00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.180\nWe also have cooling for\n\n690\n00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.270\nthe data center, which we're gonna talk\nabout in the infrastructure episode.\n\n691\n00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:41.100\nWhich is really important because how we\ncool things moving from rack to rack.\n\n692\n00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.420\nBut the one thing we\nhaven't talked about so\n\n693\n00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.650\nfar that I wanna talk about\nnow is water cooling.\n\n694\n00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:49.210\nThat when you have a system\nthat's generating a lot of heat,\n\n695\n00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:52.650\nsometimes a heatsink is not enough,\nsometimes a fan is not enough, and\n\n696\n00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:55.360\nwe might need to leverage\nsomething a little more powerful.\n\n697\n00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.410\nAnd water cooling is that solution.\n\n698\n00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:01.930\nNow the big challenge with heatsinks and\nfans is they're kinda big, right?\n\n699\n00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:05.880\nIf you look at this server,\nlet's go to our sky cam here, and\n\n700\n00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.980\nI've got these three big fans over here.\n\n701\n00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:12.200\nThese are gigantic fans, how many of\nthese fans can I have in a server?\n\n702\n00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.750\nNot too terribly many.\n\n703\n00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:18.330\nAnd if I have 64 CPUs I definitely\ncan't have 64 of those fans, and\n\n704\n00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:20.290\nwe're use to having one fan per CPU.\n\n705\n00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:23.460\nSo that's not possible anymore,\nthere's just not enough room.\n\n706\n00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.680\nSame thing for heat sinks.\n\n707\n00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.710\nHeat sinks on modern\nCPUs can be really big.\n\n708\n00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:29.180\nAnd it doesn't make sense,\n\n709\n00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:33.230\nthere's just not enough room if you've\ngot 64 CPUs to have 64 giant heat sinks.\n\n710\n00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:37.040\nSo when you get into a data center,\nespecially in a mainframe,\n\n711\n00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.820\nwhere you have 64 or\n128 CPUs in one server?\n\n712\n00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:42.990\nYou're gonna move to\na water cooling system.\n\n713\n00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:47.860\nAnd this is just a single self-contained\nwater cooling system data center\n\n714\n00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:52.090\nwater cooling systems actually span\nmultiple racks and span multiple systems.\n\n715\n00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.270\nAnd what you'll see is each CPU,\n\n716\n00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:57.600\ninstead of having a heatsink will have\na little metal plate attached to it.\n\n717\n00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.205\nAnd there'll be two hoses in In and\nan out.\n\n718\n00:35:00.205 --> 00:35:02.765\nAnd they'll be attached to that CPU.\n\n719\n00:35:02.765 --> 00:35:06.475\nAnd you'll have 64 CPUs and every one\nwill just have two hoses that run off it.\n\n720\n00:35:06.475 --> 00:35:10.165\nYou can get two hoses in\na very small amount of space.\n\n721\n00:35:10.165 --> 00:35:15.365\nSo I could have 64 CPUs with an array\nof tubes running right across the top.\n\n722\n00:35:15.365 --> 00:35:18.190\nIn fact you can even daisy\nchain them to an extent.\n\n723\n00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:20.850\nI might not daisy chain all 64,\nI might have 12, 12, 12,\n\n724\n00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:26.810\n12 like that, each kind of sharing common\nwater line and they're running back.\n\n725\n00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:29.510\nIn the tubes it's water, right.\n\n726\n00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:31.860\nIt may be water with additives to it.\n\n727\n00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:34.339\nThere's always at least a little\nbit of anti-algae agent or\n\n728\n00:35:34.339 --> 00:35:35.991\na little bit of anti-freezing, well,\n\n729\n00:35:35.991 --> 00:35:39.020\nwe don't have to worry about freezing\nbecause it's typically very hot.\n\n730\n00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:43.760\nBut this one is just water with a little\nblue coloring in it to make it look\n\n731\n00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.400\npretty.\n\n732\n00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.410\nYou don't normally bother\nwith that in servers.\n\n733\n00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:50.220\nBut that water is coming through and\ncrossing that plate.\n\n734\n00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:53.970\nAnd heat transitions into that\nwater very quickly and easily and\n\n735\n00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:56.960\nmoves out, where it's then\njumping over here to this fan.\n\n736\n00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.020\nAnd if we look over at the fan array,\nthe water tubes are going in and out.\n\n737\n00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.560\nAnd what it's actually\ndoing is going in and\n\n738\n00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.760\nthere's a big radiator\nunder the bottom of this.\n\n739\n00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.410\nAnd so in your data center,\n\n740\n00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:11.280\nyou'll have a massive radiator typically\ninside of an air conditioning unit.\n\n741\n00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.540\nAnd so\nthe hot water tubes will run into that.\n\n742\n00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:17.130\nIt'll super cool that water,\nwhich is why we need the antifreeze, so\n\n743\n00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:19.000\nit doesn't freeze up in\nthe air conditioner.\n\n744\n00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.660\nAnd then it'll come out super cool.\n\n745\n00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:21.730\nI'm actually pointing backwards, aren't I?\n\n746\n00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:22.570\nBecause of the pump.\n\n747\n00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:26.600\nSo it's gonna come out and it'll be super\ncool when it runs back to the CPUs and\n\n748\n00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.150\nkeeps them nice and cold.\n\n749\n00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:33.050\nThe advantage of this is I don't\nneed moving air in the server.\n\n750\n00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:35.990\nI don't have to worry about obstructed\nair because the water is all running in\n\n751\n00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:37.240\nthese tubes.\n\n752\n00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:40.990\nIt's where the radiator is that I need\nto worry about obstructed air, right?\n\n753\n00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:44.700\nAnd that radiator might actually be in the\nair conditioning unit on the other side of\n\n754\n00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.450\nthe room.\n\n755\n00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.990\nSo I don't have to worry about\ninterference on the servers themselves,\n\n756\n00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:49.550\nthat's pretty cool.\n\n757\n00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:52.010\nThe other thing is I need a pump,\nand this is the pump right here.\n\n758\n00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:54.790\nYou can actually see the water\ngurgling inside of this pump.\n\n759\n00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:58.840\nSo what its doing is its\nsucking water in this tube and\n\n760\n00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.840\nblowing water out the top of unit.\n\n761\n00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.010\nSo that's why we see the bubbles\nkind of moving that direction\n\n762\n00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:05.630\nas that water is flowing.\n\n763\n00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:09.990\nSo this pump is super responsible for\nmoving water as quickly as it can\n\n764\n00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:14.130\ninto the radiator which is then\ngonna push it back over to the CPU.\n\n765\n00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:16.760\nSo imagine this unit.\n\n766\n00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.430\nBut the size of our refrigerator, right?\n\n767\n00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:23.310\nA huge unit with a massive radiator and\nfans and\n\n768\n00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:26.340\nradiator might be in the roof of\nthe building so it takes the outside.\n\n769\n00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.760\nWe won't do that in Florida because the\nradiator get super hot on a Florida roof,\n\n770\n00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.690\nbut in some countries you\ncan actually do it and\n\n771\n00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:34.850\nmaintain a great cooling\nwithout even using fans.\n\n772\n00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:38.410\nBy doing that we can\nsuper cool the system.\n\n773\n00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:42.620\nOn regular servers, like the server I used\nearlier int he series, we don't need that.\n\n774\n00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:44.500\nOn a server like this we\ndon't technically need it.\n\n775\n00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.180\nWe did there just to have an example\nin the building we can show you guys.\n\n776\n00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:51.710\nBut in a main frame,\nin a main frame you're gonna need it.\n\n777\n00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:54.410\nWhen we think of main frames,\nit's really easy to think of one computer.\n\n778\n00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:56.100\nMain frames usually aren't one computer,\n\n779\n00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:59.660\nmain frames are typically many computers\njoined together, and so when you look in\n\n780\n00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:04.020\na mainframe, here's another example\nthat I pulled off of Wikimedia.\n\n781\n00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:07.450\nWhen you look at this, the mainframe\nmight be made up of tons of racks and\n\n782\n00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:09.470\nmany different components inside of it.\n\n783\n00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:13.830\nAnd keeping that cool becomes a real\nchallenge, and so we can water cool it.\n\n784\n00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:16.230\nThe challenge in water cooling\nis it's hard to see, so\n\n785\n00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:18.770\nthis data center actually does\nhave water cooling in it.\n\n786\n00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:22.250\nBut it's got sub floors since\nremoval plates down here\n\n787\n00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:23.540\nit's all run under the floor.\n\n788\n00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:28.120\nSo you actually can't see any of the water\ncooling components when you look at it.\n\n789\n00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.950\nWhich is why i wanted to show you\nguys this smaller example here.\n\n790\n00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:35.900\nBut this example is kind of\nrepresentative of what you get.\n\n791\n00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.390\nAnd if you look at it you got and\nactually labeled some of this.\n\n792\n00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:39.730\nThis is the world data service.\n\n793\n00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:41.110\nThis must be an old data center.\n\n794\n00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.610\nMail servers, database servers they've\nkinda labeled that how they've got it.\n\n795\n00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:48.480\nBut as you look around not all\nof this is going to be servers.\n\n796\n00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.180\nActually I guess all of these are servers.\n\n797\n00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.240\nBut if you go probably over on\nthe side somewhere they'll have\n\n798\n00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.230\ntheir other equipment.\n\n799\n00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:57.000\nWell like way over here these boxes\nback here these boxes look like air\n\n800\n00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:57.840\nconditioners.\n\n801\n00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.190\nSo these are big air conditioning\nunits that are down here.\n\n802\n00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:03.560\nAnd the air is actually moving through\nthe floor to get to these units.\n\n803\n00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.510\nSo by doing this we can\nhave water cooling and\n\n804\n00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:09.020\nwe don't have to worry about\nfans in the individual units.\n\n805\n00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.040\nWe don't have to worry\nabout air obstructions and\n\n806\n00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.410\nwe can cool much rapidly than we\ncan with traditional heat sinks,\n\n807\n00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:16.700\nespecially when we have\nmassive amounts of CPUs.\n\n808\n00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.480\nSo water cooling is a great\nsolution in that environment.\n\n809\n00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:24.290\n&gt;&gt; I know when the personal computing\nworld we talk about thermal, or excuse me,\n\n810\n00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:27.480\nI'm sorry, the liquid cooling\nas being a more advanced setup.\n\n811\n00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.670\nIt's not for\nthe average end user for sure.\n\n812\n00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.570\nThermal dissipation's a lot greater.\n\n813\n00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:34.560\nDon, in a server closet would you\nconsider that advanced setup,\n\n814\n00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.890\nconsidering pretty much everything\nabout a data center is advanced setup?\n\n815\n00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:38.579\nOr is that more of a commonality?\n\n816\n00:39:38.579 --> 00:39:40.945\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, it's definitely advanced.\n\n817\n00:39:40.945 --> 00:39:44.000\nMost servers aren't built for, and\nI'm glad you said liquid coolant,\n\n818\n00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.870\nbecause it's not always water sometimes\nit's mineral oil or other things.\n\n819\n00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:49.530\nIt doesn't have to be water.\n\n820\n00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:53.140\nBut liquid cooling, this server has to be\ndesigned to do it and most of them aren't.\n\n821\n00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.320\nWhen you got to Dell's website or\n\n822\n00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.780\nHP's website the majority of the servers\nare not built to be liquid cooled.\n\n823\n00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.350\nBut when you get a mainframe,\nIf it's designed for\n\n824\n00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:03.840\nliquid cooling,\nthe cooling solution's included with it.\n\n825\n00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.960\nNow mainframes cost millions of dollars.\n\n826\n00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.250\nSo when I say it's included with this,\nit's not like you're getting a free deal.\n\n827\n00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:09.690\nYou're paying for it, right.\n\n828\n00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:11.930\nBut they've designed it to\nrequire that kind of cooling.\n\n829\n00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.540\nAnd it'll be installed as\na part of that system.\n\n830\n00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.530\nSo mainframes are a big deal.\n\n831\n00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:22.160\nMost people have moved away from\nmainframes to less centralized systems,\n\n832\n00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.110\nbut there's still plenty\nof them that are out there.\n\n833\n00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:26.070\nThey're, once they're deployed it costs so\n\n834\n00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.690\nmuch money to move away from\nthem that they stick around.\n\n835\n00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:30.410\nSo you may encounter that.\n\n836\n00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:33.150\nIt's rare that we're gonna deploy\nthis just on our own, right?\n\n837\n00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:35.390\nIt's normally gonna be done in\nassociation with a vendor and\n\n838\n00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:37.250\nit'll be part of their\ninstallation services.\n\n839\n00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:38.650\nSo we just need to maintain it.\n\n840\n00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:41.510\nthings like ensuring that the pumps\nare flowing, ensuring that our\n\n841\n00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:44.580\ntemperatures are maintained and\nthat everything is running normal.\n\n842\n00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.970\nYou might have to treat\nthe liquid from time to time.\n\n843\n00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:49.840\nThere's usually an anti-algae\nagent that you have to add.\n\n844\n00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.200\nAnd then you have to filter the water in\ncase particulate matter gets inside of\n\n845\n00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.960\nthere, because you don't\nwant a tube to get clogged.\n\n846\n00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.860\nAnd so you have to do some maintenance and\ncleaning there.\n\n847\n00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.510\nIt all be part of the installation\nprocess where they teach and\n\n848\n00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:00.790\ntrain on how to manage that.\n\n849\n00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:03.650\nBut for\nmost of us its not going to be an issue.\n\n850\n00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:06.520\nBut it is something that's out there and\ncall it out on the exam objective so\n\n851\n00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.880\nI wanted to mention it here.\n\n852\n00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.260\n&gt;&gt; Don a lot of great information when it\ncomes to providing power to our devices.\n\n853\n00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.140\nI know theres a lot of things to consider.\n\n854\n00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:17.020\nDefinitely if for any reason if you\nfeel uncomfortable dealing with\n\n855\n00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.880\nelectricity you do what I do,\nyou let the professionals handle it.\n\n856\n00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:23.320\nI know enough about electricity and\nmyself to stay away from it.\n\n857\n00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.530\nAnd now judging by that clock, it does\nlook like we are running to the end of yet\n\n858\n00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:27.670\nanother great episode Don.\n\n859\n00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:30.290\nBut before we do, do you have any\nadditional words that you'd like to tell\n\n860\n00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:34.330\nour viewers when it comes too providing\npower or even cooling to your devices?\n\n861\n00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.570\n&gt;&gt; Safety first, right.\n\n862\n00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:38.520\nSome of this stuff is really dangerous.\n\n863\n00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:41.390\nAnd even if it doesn't hurt you,\nyou can hurt the equipment, and\n\n864\n00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:42.680\nthe equipment cost a lot of money.\n\n865\n00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.980\nSo you're gonna need to\ncall in an electrician.\n\n866\n00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:48.110\nMost data centers have at least\none facilities person who is\n\n867\n00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:51.110\ntypically either a union or\nlicenced electrician.\n\n868\n00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.230\nRely on them.\n\n869\n00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.880\nThey might not know the first\nthing about database servers, but\n\n870\n00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.970\nthey know a lot about electricity and\nthey know how to not die,\n\n871\n00:41:57.970 --> 00:41:59.440\nand that's kind of the key piece there.\n\n872\n00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.230\nSo safety first when it comes\nto working with electricity.\n\n873\n00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:04.750\n&gt;&gt; Words of wisdom from Don, do not die.\n\n874\n00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:07.740\nWell Don we appreciate all your\nvaluable information here, and\n\n875\n00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:10.040\nas always we appreciate\nyou the

back in.\n\n13\n00:00:29.918 --> 00:00:34.144\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be taking\na look at all the stuff we have to think\n\n14\n00:00:34.144 --> 00:00:36.810\nabout when we install\na server operating system.\n\n15\n00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.320\nCuz there's a lot that's\ninvolved in that process,\n\n16\n00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.150\nand most of you have probably already\nexperienced this a number of times of\n\n17\n00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.850\nvarious operating systems\nthat are out there.\n\n18\n00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.440\nMaybe some of you have only really\nexperienced this with desktop operating\n\n19\n00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.240\nsystems, this is your\nfirst exposure to it.\n\n20\n00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.390\nA lot of us get in the habit of learning\nhow to do installations through\n\n21\n00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.650\nvirtual machines.\n\n22\n00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.950\nAnd what you'll find is that when you get\nto a real life honest-to-goodness server,\n\n23\n00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.790\nthe installation process\nis a good bit different.\n\n24\n00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.050\nThings don't quite line up\nthe way that we expect them to\n\n25\n00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.710\nfrom desktop type experience.\n\n26\n00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.675\nSo understanding how to properly install\na server OS is an important thing to know.\n\n27\n00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:15.738\nNow, I'm gonna try and\nstay kind of OS neutral on this.\n\n28\n00:01:15.738 --> 00:01:19.580\nBecause the reality is these days, there's\nmore Linux servers out there than Windows\n\n29\n00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.200\nservers, even though there's more Windows\nworkstations than Linux by a huge margin.\n\n30\n00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.992\nBut Linux servers are very, very common.\n\n31\n00:01:25.992 --> 00:01:31.090\nAnd since what we usually see deployed on\nthe exam, they kinda focus on Windows.\n\n32\n00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.320\nAnd so I wanna make sure that I cover\neverything from the aspect of both.\n\n33\n00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.010\nAt this stage, at least in this episode,\n\n34\n00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.870\nI'm gonna be focusing more on hardware\nthan software, so it's identical.\n\n35\n00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.095\nIt's identical for Windows and Linux when\nyou're dealing with the hardware where\n\n36\n00:01:43.095 --> 00:01:46.055\nthings will change as when we actually\nget to more of the software concerns.\n\n37\n00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:48.410\n&gt;&gt; Don, I got a question for\nyou that's maybe not on the exam.\n\n38\n00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.230\nBut in your experience,\nwould you say that there's more Linux\n\n39\n00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.069\nservers today because of open source or\nstability or maybe even both?\n\n40\n00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.653\n&gt;&gt; It's hard to attribute what\nit actually is caused by,\n\n41\n00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:03.919\nI think mostly it's because these\nsoftware development projects for\n\n42\n00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:07.406\nall the scalable web apps has\nreally happened on Apache.\n\n43\n00:02:07.406 --> 00:02:11.424\nIt's really happened on that platform,\nit was designed in a Linux and\n\n44\n00:02:11.424 --> 00:02:12.592\nUnix environment.\n\n45\n00:02:12.592 --> 00:02:13.933\nNot designed in a Windows environment, and\n\n46\n00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:16.395\nyou'll get the same performance\nout of it in Windows.\n\n47\n00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:19.830\nBut being a more expensive\noperating system, developers,\n\n48\n00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.290\nat least amateur developers,\naren't as likely to work on it.\n\n49\n00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.760\nSo you get a little less development\neffort, so that's more than likely a tie.\n\n50\n00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.900\nBut the reality is at the end of the day,\nthey're both very stable platforms.\n\n51\n00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.768\nAnd then if I needed to bring up a web\nserver, I could bring up a Red Hat,\n\n52\n00:02:32.768 --> 00:02:34.615\nUbuntu, or Windows web server.\n\n53\n00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:37.020\nI know they're all gonna run really well.\n\n54\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.596\nAnd then they've all got vendor\nsupport from me to make sure that\n\n55\n00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:41.610\nI keep them updated, and\npatched, and secured.\n\n56\n00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.730\nSo that kind of stuff is not\nsomething I have to worry about.\n\n57\n00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.910\nExcept, before I even start installing\nan operating system on my server,\n\n58\n00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.060\nI need to make sure that whoever made my\nserver supports that operating system.\n\n59\n00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.454\nBecause the vendors, we talked about this\na bit when we're talking about sever\n\n60\n00:02:59.454 --> 00:03:02.495\ncomponents in our previous episode\nwhere I said that they don't follow\n\n61\n00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:04.287\na lot of standards when they make severs.\n\n62\n00:03:04.287 --> 00:03:08.860\nThese aren't standard ATX motherboards and\nthey can change the arrangements of stuff\n\n63\n00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.115\nthat they make proprietary RAID\ncontrollers and chipsets and\n\n64\n00:03:12.115 --> 00:03:13.131\nall these things.\n\n65\n00:03:13.131 --> 00:03:17.345\nSo when you install an operating system,\nyou need drivers, right?\n\n66\n00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:20.190\nAny drivers to support\nthe operating system.\n\n67\n00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.090\nAnd in the Windows world, there's\njust Microsoft Windows and that's it,\n\n68\n00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.280\nand so all the vendors make drivers for\nMicrosoft Windows.\n\n69\n00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.960\nBut in the Linux world,\nthere's not just one Linux,\n\n70\n00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.930\nthere's several distributions\nthat are out there.\n\n71\n00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:34.763\nSome are based on other ones, right?\n\n72\n00:03:34.763 --> 00:03:37.480\nSo, Ubuntu is based off of Debian.\n\n73\n00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.280\nSo if you have a driver that works for\nDebian,\n\n74\n00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.780\nthe driver will work in Ubuntu for\nthe most part.\n\n75\n00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.514\nIf you have Red Hat, CentOs,\nFedora, those guys all share.\n\n76\n00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:48.142\nOracle Linux goes in there\nalso where they all share, and\n\n77\n00:03:48.142 --> 00:03:50.130\nyou can share a common driver.\n\n78\n00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.300\nBut if you're running Ubuntu and\n\n79\n00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.170\nyou buy a Dell server, and Dell is\nonly putting out drivers for Red Hat,\n\n80\n00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.080\nyou might not be able to run\nUbuntu on that hardware.\n\n81\n00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.010\nYou might run into hardware\nincompatibility issues where\n\n82\n00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.520\nyour operating system is not able to\ntake advantage of the hardware, and\n\n83\n00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.160\nserver hardware is expensive.\n\n84\n00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.820\nSo you wanna make sure that you\ncan take advantage of every single\n\n85\n00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.560\naspect of what it is,\ncuz you paid for it, right?\n\n86\n00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.150\nSo always make sure that\nyour vendor supports.\n\n87\n00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.220\nAnd that's really the first step\nof getting a new server installed\n\n88\n00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.720\nis before you even touch the hardware is\nyou need to go to the vendor's website for\n\n89\n00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.910\nthat server.\n\n90\n00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.212\nAnd you need to download all\nthe drivers that are available,\n\n91\n00:04:28.212 --> 00:04:31.657\nyou need to download any firmware\nupdates that are available.\n\n92\n00:04:31.657 --> 00:04:34.996\nCuz often times, there's gonna be firmware\nupdates that need to be done, and\n\n93\n00:04:34.996 --> 00:04:36.882\nwe need to get those loaded and\nput in place.\n\n94\n00:04:36.882 --> 00:04:38.526\nNow, when I talk about drivers,\n\n95\n00:04:38.526 --> 00:04:41.770\nthere's standard hardware that's\ngonna be included, right?\n\n96\n00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.189\nThere's a video card, there's gonna\nbe network adapters and so on.\n\n97\n00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:49.433\nBut we've gotta think about the role\nthat server is gonna be performing,\n\n98\n00:04:49.433 --> 00:04:52.440\nbecause that may change the hardware also.\n\n99\n00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.490\nFor example,\nI used to support some fax servers.\n\n100\n00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.566\nI know,\nfax is a little outdated these days, but\n\n101\n00:04:57.566 --> 00:05:00.924\nwe had these cards that had 16 phone lines\nin them that would go in the server.\n\n102\n00:05:00.924 --> 00:05:05.193\nWell, that was special hardware, I had\nto make sure I had the slots to support\n\n103\n00:05:05.193 --> 00:05:09.550\nthat hardware, because I believe they're\nPCI-X cards if I remember right.\n\n104\n00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.226\nSo I had the PCI-X slots inside of\nthe server to be able to support it, and\n\n105\n00:05:13.226 --> 00:05:16.781\nthen I had to have the drivers to be\nable to recognize that hardware in my\n\n106\n00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:18.180\noperating systems.\n\n107\n00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.056\nSo I had to gather that\ninformation together, and\n\n108\n00:05:20.056 --> 00:05:21.627\nit varied based on the role of the server.\n\n109\n00:05:21.627 --> 00:05:25.200\nIf it's a typical web server,\nthere's probably not a whole lot you need.\n\n110\n00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.080\nBut if it's gonna be a final server,\n\n111\n00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.680\nyou're probably gonna have\nextra hard drives in there.\n\n112\n00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.143\nYou're going to have a RAID\ncontroller in there.\n\n113\n00:05:32.143 --> 00:05:35.080\nI mean, you think about what that\nRAID configuration is gonna be like.\n\n114\n00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.648\nIf it's connected to a SAN, you're\nprobably gonna need a Fibre Channel or\n\n115\n00:05:38.648 --> 00:05:41.039\nHBA, a Host Bus Adapter,\nto connect to that SAN.\n\n116\n00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.239\nAnd if you're gonna be doing boot from SAN\nwhere you don't even have the hard drives\n\n117\n00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:46.319\nin the server at all.\n\n118\n00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:49.315\nWhen the server boots up,\nit looks at that HBA, it sees the SAN and\n\n119\n00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:53.180\nit boots from an operating system\ndisk that's out there on the SAN.\n\n120\n00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.940\nWell, you need server hardware\nthat can support that, right?\n\n121\n00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.795\nAnd that's a really cool set up too,\na lot of people do that.\n\n122\n00:05:58.795 --> 00:06:00.500\nBecause if you have\na failure on the server,\n\n123\n00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.600\nyou can just swap the whole server out.\n\n124\n00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.360\nBecause the operating system,\nthe data files, all that's on the SAN.\n\n125\n00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.134\nSo you could replace an entire server very\nquickly, very easily and be back up and\n\n126\n00:06:09.134 --> 00:06:10.530\nrunning in no time.\n\n127\n00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:16.020\nSo understanding the role that your server\nis gonna be performing and understanding\n\n128\n00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.550\nthe limitations of your operating system,\nthat's gonna be important.\n\n129\n00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.510\nWe need to go to our vendors and\nfind that out.\n\n130\n00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.868\nNow, the server that I've been\nusing in this show is a HP server.\n\n131\n00:06:25.868 --> 00:06:28.764\nAnd with HP,\nusually when you buy one of their servers,\n\n132\n00:06:28.764 --> 00:06:32.580\nthey come with a CD that has an HP smart\npack on it that has a ton of drivers and\n\n133\n00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.819\nall that stuff is just\nbuild right into it.\n\n134\n00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.580\nOther vendors like Dell, they'll usually\npackage in a disk also that has drivers,\n\n135\n00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.390\nbut those disks are typically out\nof date by the time you get them.\n\n136\n00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.450\nSo I don't like to rely on those.\n\n137\n00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.215\nBefore I start working with a new server,\n\n138\n00:06:50.215 --> 00:06:53.507\nI'll typically go to that vendor's\nwebsite like I'm on Dell's site here.\n\n139\n00:06:53.507 --> 00:07:00.400\nAnd you can come in and find your server\nand download the drivers and so on.\n\n140\n00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.070\nIt's also a great way to come in and\nfind out, whether or not,\n\n141\n00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.960\nyou've got an operating\nsystem that's supported.\n\n142\n00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.009\nSo I'm just gonna pull up,\nI'll do an R9, we'll do an R920.\n\n143\n00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:14.120\nAll right, so\nI'm puling up a PowerEdge R920 here.\n\n144\n00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.570\nAnd when I go to look at it, I've got\nmy drivers and downloads and manuals.\n\n145\n00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.542\nAnd in the manuals, you'll find out\nwhat operating systems are supported and\n\n146\n00:07:20.542 --> 00:07:22.400\nwhat other features\nare supported inside of it.\n\n147\n00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.040\nYou should have looked at that\nbefore purchasing the server, but\n\n148\n00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.960\nwe don't always have that advantage,\nright?\n\n149\n00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.520\nYou go to work somewhere,\nthey've already got a few hundred servers,\n\n150\n00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.664\nyou weren't involved in that\ndecision-making process.\n\n151\n00:07:31.664 --> 00:07:35.880\nBut when I come in here, notice how this\nR920 defaulted to Windows Server 2008 R2.\n\n152\n00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.516\nThat means that when this\nserver was purchased,\n\n153\n00:07:38.516 --> 00:07:41.485\nthat was the operating system\nthey were selling on it.\n\n154\n00:07:41.485 --> 00:07:47.362\nWell, Windows Server 2012 came out,\n2012 R2, 2016 is out.\n\n155\n00:07:47.362 --> 00:07:51.069\nBut Server 2008 R2 is still\nsupported by Microsoft, and\n\n156\n00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:53.573\nas such, it's still supported by Dell.\n\n157\n00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:57.126\nBut if I go to Change OS Here I\ncan come through and I can pick.\n\n158\n00:07:57.126 --> 00:08:02.010\nAnd I've got Citrix XenServer,\nNovell SuSE Linux.\n\n159\n00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.950\nWe've got Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5,\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.\n\n160\n00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:10.600\nWe've got SuSE Linux 12,\nVMWare's ESXI, Windows Server 2008,\n\n161\n00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.202\n2012, and 2016, They're are all supported.\n\n162\n00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:16.890\nSo if I'm running one of these\nguys I'm gonna be in great shape.\n\n163\n00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.154\nWhat am I learning Ubuntu?\n\n164\n00:08:19.154 --> 00:08:20.385\nIt's not on the list.\n\n165\n00:08:20.385 --> 00:08:22.310\nUbuntu's not on the list, not on the list.\n\n166\n00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.910\nWe aren't going to have drivers for it.\n\n167\n00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.421\nThese RedHat drivers,\nthey're Linux drivers.\n\n168\n00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:29.348\nBut RedHat is very different than right?\n\n169\n00:08:29.348 --> 00:08:34.226\nThey use different systems underneath and\nthey follow different design models, like\n\n170\n00:08:34.226 --> 00:08:39.130\none adopted system D for the other and so\nyou end up in conflicts and changes there.\n\n171\n00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.920\nSo there may not be the ability for\nme to do it.\n\n172\n00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.680\nNow, Ubuntu, the guys over at Canonical,\nthey're smart and\n\n173\n00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.450\nthey know it like hey, when we build\nthis today, if we want people to run it,\n\n174\n00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.560\nwe've gotta create some of\nour own drivers sometimes.\n\n175\n00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.270\nAnd they'll do that.\n\n176\n00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.640\nThey'll go and\nget these RedHat drivers and\n\n177\n00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.860\nchange them and\nmake them work on their system.\n\n178\n00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.810\nBut you're not gonna get official support.\n\n179\n00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.890\nSo, if you think your motherboard\nis failing and you call Dell, and\n\n180\n00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.220\nDell wants to run some diagnostics and\nyou say you're running Ubuntu,\n\n181\n00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.410\nthey'll say sorry,\nnot a supported operating system.\n\n182\n00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:06.210\nAnd that's that, right?\n\n183\n00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.710\nSo you need to make sure that\nyou're doing a supported\n\n184\n00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.990\noperating system on your hardware.\n\n185\n00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:15.797\nThis one's Windows Server 2008 R2,\nso that's what I'll stick with here.\n\n186\n00:09:15.797 --> 00:09:17.870\nBut I could change if I needed to for\none of the other ones.\n\n187\n00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.490\nNow, when you pick the hardware,\n\n188\n00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:22.550\nnotice that was one here that\nsays not applicable, right?\n\n189\n00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.620\nThere's some things like\nfirmware updates for\n\n190\n00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.940\nthe hardware that aren't\nreally tied to an OS.\n\n191\n00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.000\nTheir installer might be, but usually they\nmake a bootable disc, a bootable USB key,\n\n192\n00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.540\nor bootable floppy disc, or\nsomething crazy like that, a CD, and\n\n193\n00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.970\nyou boot off of that disk\nto update the system.\n\n194\n00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.760\nOther ones update from within the\noperating system itself, so you go ahead\n\n195\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.520\nand install the operating system and\nthen you do the firmware updates.\n\n196\n00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.090\nBut if we can do firmware updates ahead\nof time, it's always a good idea.\n\n197\n00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.040\nAnd the reason is, right now,\nthe server's offline.\n\n198\n00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.950\nWe're about to install an OS.\n\n199\n00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.340\nIf I do it later,\nI've got to take the server offline.\n\n200\n00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.510\nI've got to create some downtime,\nso it's better to do it now.\n\n201\n00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:00.420\nAnd there are problems, bugs,\nthat creep up in the drivers, and\n\n202\n00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.440\nupdating the firmware\nnormally solves those.\n\n203\n00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.220\nUpdating firmware\nnormally does two things.\n\n204\n00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.440\nOne, it fixes bugs,\nwhich prevents unexpected downtime.\n\n205\n00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.130\nAnd two, it adds support for\nmore features or hardware.\n\n206\n00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:12.820\nSo, for example,\n\n207\n00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:17.750\nwhen you buy your server, it might\nhave a maximum of 256 gigs of RAM.\n\n208\n00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:22.195\nAnd it might have a maximum of hard drives\nno larger than eight terabytes, right?\n\n209\n00:10:22.195 --> 00:10:23.460\nAnd you can have a bunch of hard drives,\nbut\n\n210\n00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.650\nno one can be more than eight terabytes.\n\n211\n00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:29.960\nAnd then they release a BIOS update, and\nnow it can support 10 terabyte drives.\n\n212\n00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.710\nOr it can support 512 gigs of RAM,\nthey recognize that larger space.\n\n213\n00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.730\nSo that happens, they introduce features.\n\n214\n00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:39.090\nWhen a new operating system comes out,\nso Windows Server 2016, right?\n\n215\n00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.240\nWindows Server 2016 wasn't out\nwhen this server went on sale.\n\n216\n00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.420\nSo they had to add support for\nit after the fact, and\n\n217\n00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.770\nthe firmware is what'll\nnormally take that.\n\n218\n00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.300\nSo that'll normally show up\nunder the not applicable, but\n\n219\n00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.890\nlet me just jump down\nto Windows Server 2016.\n\n220\n00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:52.860\nThere we go.\n\n221\n00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.370\nSo I think I still ended up on\nthe not applicable, but anyhow.\n\n222\n00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.460\nSo when we start to look at it you'll see\nsome things in here that are fiber channel\n\n223\n00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.110\ndrivers, right?\n\n224\n00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.550\nThose are drivers if I've got\nthe fiber channel adapter.\n\n225\n00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.770\nBut we'll also see things\nin here like our BIOS.\n\n226\n00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.790\nAnd here's a BIOS update, and\nthis is just a binary file.\n\n227\n00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.640\nIt's an update package for RedHat Linux.\n\n228\n00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.070\nGuess I clicked on RedHat by accident.\n\n229\n00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:18.490\nBut you'll find these in here and\nthese are the ones that get us updated.\n\n230\n00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:20.910\nYou can view the details to find out\nwhat it is that they added in this\n\n231\n00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:21.730\nparticular update.\n\n232\n00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.500\nAnd maybe it adds some feature\nthat you don't care about,\n\n233\n00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.605\nsomething you're not gonna use.\n\n234\n00:11:25.605 --> 00:11:30.250\nThen you're not really forced to do it,\nbut if it fixes a security exploit, well,\n\n235\n00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:31.520\nyou wanna get on that kind of fast.\n\n236\n00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.390\nSo it's a good idea to read through and\nsee.\n\n237\n00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.290\nThis one says importance optional.\n\n238\n00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.630\nSo right off the bat I know\nI can ignore it if I want.\n\n239\n00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:42.060\nAnd if I look at what it's adding,\nfixed an issue where the slot\n\n240\n00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.150\ndisablement menu in the system setup\nreported an issue with slot eight,\n\n241\n00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:48.215\nslot nine, and slot 10 options.\n\n242\n00:11:48.215 --> 00:11:51.634\nOkay, well, if I'm seeing that,\nif my system is exhibiting those symptoms,\n\n243\n00:11:51.634 --> 00:11:53.105\nthen I'll wanna fix it.\n\n244\n00:11:53.105 --> 00:11:57.005\nBut if I'm not using slots eight, nine,\nand 10, then it doesn't really affect me.\n\n245\n00:11:57.005 --> 00:11:59.955\nAnd if I'm not even going into\nthe slot disablement menu, again,\n\n246\n00:11:59.955 --> 00:12:00.665\nit's not affecting me.\n\n247\n00:12:00.665 --> 00:12:04.125\nSo always keep that in mind when\nyou go and do updates, all right?\n\n248\n00:12:04.125 --> 00:12:10.270\nNow, when you fire up a server\nthe first time, it's a neat process.\n\n249\n00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.470\nIf you've never powered on a server\nbefore, basically you're gonna plug them\n\n250\n00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.590\nin, you're gonna apply power to it, and\nthen you're gonna push the power button.\n\n251\n00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.080\nAnd something really\nstrange is gonna happen,\n\n252\n00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.890\nit's a lot different than a desktop.\n\n253\n00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:24.060\nWhen you first power on a server,\nyou get a black screen on the monitor, and\n\n254\n00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.140\nnothing shows up.\n\n255\n00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.930\nNothing shows up for a good 30 seconds.\n\n256\n00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.510\nAnd on a work station, if I pushed a power\nbutton and didn't see anything for\n\n257\n00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.670\n30 seconds, I'd assume there's a problem.\n\n258\n00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:37.080\nBut most servers run through\na series of hardware diagnostics and\n\n259\n00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.800\nthey start with their\nenvironmental controls.\n\n260\n00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.630\nThey check things like\nare the fans running and\n\n261\n00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.500\nis the temperature of the motherboard\nat an acceptable point.\n\n262\n00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.860\nIf they're not, it doesn't power on.\n\n263\n00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:52.140\nAnd so when you hit that power button on\na server, it gets really, really loud.\n\n264\n00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.880\nIn the last few episodes,\n\n265\n00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.760\nI've had this server sitting right\nhere on the desk with Wes and I.\n\n266\n00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.270\nFor this show we're actually gonna turn it\non, so I didn't want it siting right here.\n\n267\n00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:01.390\nYou wouldn't be able to hear me talk.\n\n268\n00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.650\nThe fans ramp up to full speed.\n\n269\n00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.130\nAnd it's because they're making\nsure the fans haven't failed.\n\n270\n00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:11.610\nAnd after 20 seconds or so of running\nat full speed, then they step down to\n\n271\n00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:15.410\na normal speed because they've been\ntested to work and the server moves on.\n\n272\n00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.720\nAnd it's testing other\nthings at the same time.\n\n273\n00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.280\nAre the hard drives spinning up?\n\n274\n00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.930\nAre the power supplies\nproviding the proper voltage?\n\n275\n00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:26.181\nCan the power supplies run\nat 100% full draw, right?\n\n276\n00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:27.627\nSo it'll take both power supplies and\n\n277\n00:13:27.627 --> 00:13:30.650\nthe them to full draw to make sure\neverything's working properly.\n\n278\n00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.350\nThat hardware diagnostic\nprocess is really important.\n\n279\n00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:37.340\nAnd only when we pass that will it then\nstart to throw things up on the screen for\n\n280\n00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.760\nus to see as far video.\n\n281\n00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.640\n&gt;&gt; You know, Don,\nspeaking of some of the diagnostics,\n\n282\n00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.540\ndoesn't it check like the ECC, the error\ncorrecting ability of the memory,\n\n283\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.410\nlike it writes to the memory,\nthen it reads it out, and\n\n284\n00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.590\nsees if they're the same as\npart of the diagnostic process?\n\n285\n00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.654\nYou know I thought I've seen\nthat on a splash screen before.\n\n286\n00:13:50.654 --> 00:13:51.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n287\n00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.150\nSometimes that's hidden.\n\n288\n00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.440\nUsually there's a quick check\nthat happens that's hidden, and\n\n289\n00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.000\nyou can enable a full check\nthat's actually displayed.\n\n290\n00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.900\nI used to do that all the time cuz\nit was nice to see that check.\n\n291\n00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.910\nBut it was nice back when you had\n64 megabytes of memory in a server.\n\n292\n00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.820\nNow that you have 64 gigabytes\nof memory in a server,\n\n293\n00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.350\nit can take 20 minutes to\ndo a full memory check.\n\n294\n00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:13.950\nThat means any time you reboot\nthe server it takes 20 minutes.\n\n295\n00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.140\nThat's not acceptable, right?\n\n296\n00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.950\nSo we don't normally turn that on anymore\nunless we think there's a problem.\n\n297\n00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.160\nIf you think there's a problem,\nyou turn it on for troubleshooting.\n\n298\n00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.580\nWell, you have a lot of tools, like that\nmemory check, that are available to you.\n\n299\n00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.025\nAnd they can be pulled up on demand.\n\n300\n00:14:25.025 --> 00:14:27.775\nYou'll see all those as soon\nas the video initializes.\n\n301\n00:14:27.775 --> 00:14:30.725\nNow, I mentioned that I didn't want\nthe server right here on the desk with me,\n\n302\n00:14:30.725 --> 00:14:34.465\nso I've got an HP server, and I'm gonna\nbe using its integrated lights-out board.\n\n303\n00:14:34.465 --> 00:14:35.475\nIt's a remote management board.\n\n304\n00:14:35.475 --> 00:14:37.905\nWe're gonna talk more about\nthat in another episode.\n\n305\n00:14:37.905 --> 00:14:40.615\nBut what that ILO board is gonna do\n\n306\n00:14:40.615 --> 00:14:45.240\nis it'll let me see the console of that\nserver even though I'm not there, right?\n\n307\n00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.120\nSo it's actually in my office on the other\nside of the building right now so\n\n308\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.250\nwe don't have to hear the fans and\nall of that.\n\n309\n00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.830\nAnd it's neat because I can see what's\non the screen even if it's powered off.\n\n310\n00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:55.610\nThe server's powered off right now, and so\n\n311\n00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.300\nI get a little message here\nthat's telling me no video.\n\n312\n00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.860\nAnd I'm just going to apply\npower to the server real quick\n\n313\n00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.650\nby hitting its power button which, again,\nthe ILO board will let me do remotely.\n\n314\n00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:09.880\nSo when I go into Power Management,\nwhich will load eventually,\n\n315\n00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.380\nmy session might have timed out,\nbut I'll be able to turn it on.\n\n316\n00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:14.550\nAnd here we go,\n\n317\n00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.280\nI'm gonna do it a momentary press\non the power button to turn it on.\n\n318\n00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.330\nAll right, so it's now sending that\npower on signal to the server.\n\n319\n00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.010\nAnd there we go, the server is on.\n\n320\n00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.602\nNow, if I switch back over to my console,\n\n321\n00:15:25.602 --> 00:15:28.797\nthis is showing me what's\non the screen right now.\n\n322\n00:15:28.797 --> 00:15:30.740\nNo video, right?\n\n323\n00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.510\nIf I were in my office right now, and\nmy office neighbors are probably gonna get\n\n324\n00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:38.460\nangry at me, what they're hearing\nright now is a lot of fan noise.\n\n325\n00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.925\nIt's ramping up to full speed and\n\n326\n00:15:39.925 --> 00:15:42.708\nstarting to run through those\nchecks that I was talking about.\n\n327\n00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:46.349\nAnd when it's done,\nthen it is going to activate the video and\n\n328\n00:15:46.349 --> 00:15:48.799\nwe are going to see the HP logo come up,\nand\n\n329\n00:15:48.799 --> 00:15:52.531\nit is going to do some more checks\nthat are a little HP specific.\n\n330\n00:15:52.531 --> 00:15:55.109\nTo the check things like,\nis the ale board working?\n\n331\n00:15:55.109 --> 00:15:57.460\nWhich I know it is cause\nI'm using it right now.\n\n332\n00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:02.410\nOr is the RAID controller presence and\nit doesn't have a license\n\n333\n00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:05.490\nfile cause the HP has it's entire\nlicense is on the raid control.\n\n334\n00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.930\nSo that I check that stuff and\nthen you'll start move forward.\n\n335\n00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:13.000\nAnd at that time on some\nservers like Wes described,\n\n336\n00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.290\nyou'll actually see a lot of\noutput about your hardware.\n\n337\n00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.560\nThere it goes.\n\n338\n00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.820\nOn other servers,\nyou might not see much output at all.\n\n339\n00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.470\nOn HP, they like to show a logo and\n\n340\n00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.050\nit's actually hiding a lot of\nwhat's going on in the background.\n\n341\n00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:25.770\nIt's a little message.\n\n342\n00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:29.770\nIt'll say something like,\npress any key to see extension details or\n\n343\n00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.340\nsomething like that, so\nyou can see what's going on.\n\n344\n00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.730\nHere's the Power and thermal calibration.\n\n345\n00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.790\nThis is what's on the monitor on that\nserver right now as it boots up.\n\n346\n00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.730\nIt's running through that calibration and\n\n347\n00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:41.940\nchecking to make sure all\nthe temperature sensors are working.\n\n348\n00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.360\nIt's already done a lot of the checks,\n\n349\n00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.600\nthe fans at this point\nshould be settling down.\n\n350\n00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.130\nAnd that people who are at my office\nare hopefully calming down a bit.\n\n351\n00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.010\nBut that one's gonna come up, here we go.\n\n352\n00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.810\nSo now it's starting to check things,\nright?\n\n353\n00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:56.640\nChecking some memory, here's the advanced\nmemory protection mode, ECC support is on,\n\n354\n00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.070\nredundant ROM detected,\n\n355\n00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:02.560\nand there's my ambient temperature\nright now it's 21 degrees Celsius or\n\n356\n00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:07.160\n69 degrees Fahrenheit, and here's the\npress any key to view option ROM messages.\n\n357\n00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.000\nSo if I send a keystroke to it I'll\nstart to see additional output for\n\n358\n00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.530\nwhat's going on.\n\n359\n00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.410\nSo all that's happening\nduring the boot process,\n\n360\n00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:19.260\nhere I can see the Smart Array Controller\nis turning on, the array controller, and\n\n361\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.430\nI get press F8 to run the option ROM.\n\n362\n00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.310\nIf I want to configure\nthe array controller,\n\n363\n00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:24.800\nI'm going to hit F8 to get in there.\n\n364\n00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.350\nAnd then we get our network boot.\n\n365\n00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:30.230\nIf I'm doing a remote installation like\na pixie boot I can go in for that.\n\n366\n00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.900\nIt's going through each\nof those option RAMs, and\n\n367\n00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:37.040\neventually it's going to get to the point,\nwhere Boots an operating system,\n\n368\n00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.260\neither from the hard drives from a CD,\nfrom a USB key,\n\n369\n00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.460\nfrom whatever is available, and\nnow we can go on an install.\n\n370\n00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.560\nNow the temptation is, when you got a new\nserver, you just pop that CD in, or\n\n371\n00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.740\nstick in that USB key,\npress the power button.\n\n372\n00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.240\nAnd go to installing, right?\n\n373\n00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.360\nAnd you certainly could.\n\n374\n00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.970\nI've got a Windows disk in\nthere right now, and so\n\n375\n00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:57.760\nit's going to boot off that and\nwe can start the install,\n\n376\n00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.130\nbut there's still some work\nthat needs to be done first.\n\n377\n00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, my first thought is, you've been\nmentioning a whole bunch about RAID and\n\n378\n00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.260\nthe RAID controllers and\nsome of the thing you have to prepare,\n\n379\n00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.110\nyou even have to even prepare the storage\ndaemon, except the operating system.\n\n380\n00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:12.650\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely, when you\nbuy a server with multiple hard drives\n\n381\n00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.570\n&gt;&gt; That has a RAID controller built in,\n\n382\n00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:18.550\nit probably has a default configuration.\n\n383\n00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:22.690\nAnd you could probably install\nusing that default configuration.\n\n384\n00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.930\nBut man,\nis it hard to change after the fact.\n\n385\n00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:30.650\nIf you have a RAID five array,\nyou're like I really want a RAID ten.\n\n386\n00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:33.680\nOr you've got rade zero stripes, and\n\n387\n00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.930\nyou're like boy I really wish I had some\nredundancy and switch that to rade five.\n\n388\n00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:42.850\nTo switch the RAID you've got to take\nall the data off, rebuild the array.\n\n389\n00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.420\nAnd then put all of the data back on.\n\n390\n00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:48.210\nThat takes a lot of time, the more\ndata you have the longer it takes.\n\n391\n00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.770\nNo matter what the server is going\nto be offline for a little while.\n\n392\n00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.320\nSo that's not exactly a fun time.\n\n393\n00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.020\nYou need to configure that beforehand.\n\n394\n00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.850\nI don't have any data on here right now,\nso if I need to blow away the drives and\n\n395\n00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.900\nreinstall or whatever, I can do that and\nit's not a big deal, right?\n\n396\n00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.490\nSo that's one of the things\nthat we need to think about.\n\n397\n00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:09.800\nIn a lot of instances people do software\nRAID You're never gonna do that.\n\n398\n00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.270\nOn a real server in a production\nenvironment, software RAID is evil.\n\n399\n00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.190\nIt kills performance.\n\n400\n00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:18.200\nEvery server these days has\na RAID controller built into it,\n\n401\n00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.650\noftentimes more than one.\n\n402\n00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.780\nMy server Actually has two\nRAID controllers on it.\n\n403\n00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.870\nThere's one that's integrated\ninto the motherboard,\n\n404\n00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:28.310\nit's the cheapie kind of give away one\nthat they include with any server.\n\n405\n00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.640\nBut then I've got an added\nin HP Smart Array\n\n406\n00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.390\nwhich is a expensive rate controller.\n\n407\n00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:38.030\nIt's one that does a really good\njob because that's what I needed.\n\n408\n00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.040\nIf you don't need that, if you're not\nworried about disk IO you can go with\n\n409\n00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.910\nthe cheapie one that's\nbuilt into the motherboard.\n\n410\n00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.600\nSo, we need to make sure we're\nusing the right one first off.\n\n411\n00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.340\nI can use the wrong rate\ncontroller all together.\n\n412\n00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.120\nI paid money for this extra one and\nmaybe I'm not using it.\n\n413\n00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.480\nAnd then we need to set up the array\nto be the way that we want it.\n\n414\n00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.060\nSo, setting up storage is a pretty\nimportant thing The other thing is,\n\n415\n00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.980\nthere's gonna be BIOS settings\nthat we want to change.\n\n416\n00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:03.010\nAnd you can't change BIOS settings on\nthe fly, they're changed at boot time.\n\n417\n00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:04.840\nSo if I wanna change a setting later on,\n\n418\n00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.990\nI'm gonna have to reboot the server\nto do it, which creates downtime.\n\n419\n00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:11.100\nSo if I can get that set up correctly,\nI can do that right here.\n\n420\n00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.870\nRemember I mentioned,\nthink about the role of your server?\n\n421\n00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:18.470\nIf this is gonna be a virtualization\nserver Virtualization hypervisors,\n\n422\n00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:22.530\nthey require certain features in your CPU,\nthey need a 64-bit CPU.\n\n423\n00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:24.200\nWell, that's not a switch you can flip.\n\n424\n00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.890\nYou either buy a 64-bit CPU or you don't.\n\n425\n00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:29.410\nBut it also needs things like\nthe virtualization extensions.\n\n426\n00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:34.710\nIntel's VTX or AMDV, and those can\nbe turned on and off in the BIOS.\n\n427\n00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.960\nSo you might have VTX\nsupport in your processor,\n\n428\n00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.020\nand it's turned off in the BIOS.\n\n429\n00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.770\nOr VTD, the virtualized storage,\nthe disk IO.\n\n430\n00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.950\nThose, they can be turned off in BIOS.\n\n431\n00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.830\nSo if this is gonna be a virtualization\nserver I need to turn that on.\n\n432\n00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:51.480\nIf it's just gonna be a database server\nthough and not a virtualization server,\n\n433\n00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.140\nI don't care about those features.\n\n434\n00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.740\nSo I might choose to turn them off.\n\n435\n00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.210\nOr leave them on, or\nnot even bother, not even look.\n\n436\n00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.200\nBut, I can jump into the BIOS to set that.\n\n437\n00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.030\nOther things we can do in the BIOS\nare things like the boot order,\n\n438\n00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.810\nwhich media we want to boot from.\n\n439\n00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.170\nIf I'm gonna be installing\nfrom the USB key,\n\n440\n00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:11.310\nI need to make sure the USB key is listed\nin the boot order so I can boot from it.\n\n441\n00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.240\nMost servers do have a one-time\nboot menu you can use.\n\n442\n00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.730\nYou might have noticed that on my screen,\nit said press F11 during boot and\n\n443\n00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:16.980\nyou can jump in there.\n\n444\n00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.110\nYou can do that, or\nif you have the order set properly,\n\n445\n00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.300\nyou really shouldn't have to.\n\n446\n00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.420\nAll right, well, enough of me talking.\n\n447\n00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.930\nLet's run through this like\nI would on a normal server.\n\n448\n00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.040\nThe first thing I do on a normal\nserver is I go into the BIOS.\n\n449\n00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.810\nNow mine's already booted to\nthe Windows installer, so\n\n450\n00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:32.290\nI'm gonna have to restart it.\n\n451\n00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:38.526\nAnd once I restart it, I'll have that\noption to go into the BIOS again and\n\n452\n00:21:38.526 --> 00:21:45.395\nI can restart in the old Windows way if I\nwanted to or I will restart the other way.\n\n453\n00:21:45.395 --> 00:21:47.392\nCuz we just come in here\nuntill the dual call boot.\n\n454\n00:21:47.392 --> 00:21:51.406\n[LAUGH] All right, so that's gonna reboot\nit, That server's gonna go offline, and\n\n455\n00:21:51.406 --> 00:21:52.450\nthen reboot.\n\n456\n00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:56.080\nAnd when it boots, I'll start to see\nthose BIOS screens come back up.\n\n457\n00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.670\nAnd during the screens,\n\n458\n00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:02.430\nthere were parts where it said press\nF9 to go into the boot, right?\n\n459\n00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.480\nInto the BIOS menus, or press F8.\n\n460\n00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.430\nSo you kinda have to pay attention\nto what your key command is.\n\n461\n00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:09.440\nAnd it is different from vendor to vendor.\n\n462\n00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:13.640\nSome vendors use F1 or\ncontrol F10, shift F10,\n\n463\n00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.700\nyou see all sorts of different\nones that are out there.\n\n464\n00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:21.290\nOn this one I'm pretty sure it's F8 to get\ninto the byhouse, but we'll see it pop by.\n\n465\n00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:22.140\nIf I miss it,\n\n466\n00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:26.600\nif I'm like a workstation server normally\ngive you two chances to get into byhouse.\n\n467\n00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.210\nOne right at the beginning, and\n\n468\n00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:30.960\nthen one after all the other\nhardware is initialized.\n\n469\n00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.170\nSo after the RAID controller\ndoes its thing and\n\n470\n00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.980\nthe network adapter does its thing,\nyou get one more chance.\n\n471\n00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:39.740\nBut that second menu on an HP server,\nit goes really fast.\n\n472\n00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.160\nI almost always miss it, but\n\n473\n00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.070\nthat's a great chance to hit F11\nto do a one time boot change.\n\n474\n00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:47.370\nBut this one's going to restart here and\n\n475\n00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:49.880\nas soon as it does,\nI'm just going to jump right in there and\n\n476\n00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.240\nhit that F8 key to go into BIOS so\nwe can take a look at the settings.\n\n477\n00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.620\nWhile we're waiting on that,\n\n478\n00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.840\nsome of the other things we can configure\nin BIOS, you can set the clock, right.\n\n479\n00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.700\nThere is an on board machine\nclock in every server and so\n\n480\n00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.440\nwe can set that to whatever the\nappropriate time is for our environment.\n\n481\n00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.810\nWe can enable virtualization extensions.\n\n482\n00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:12.040\nWe can verify that memory is being\ndetected at the right speed.\n\n483\n00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:16.370\nWe talked about that in one of the other\nepisodes to that sometimes memory can be\n\n484\n00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:21.740\ndetected at the wrong speed, That you\nmight have 1666 memory in there but\n\n485\n00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:27.020\nit detects at 1333 or the wrong\nchannel number or something like that.\n\n486\n00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.000\nSo you can verify that.\n\n487\n00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.600\nThey do some other diagnostic things.\n\n488\n00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.670\nYou can see the number of the unit\nin there and all of that good stuff.\n\n489\n00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.210\nSo here it's going to boot.\n\n490\n00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.220\nOops.\n\n491\n00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:42.420\nAnd eventually I'm gonna see that menu,\nI can press F8,\n\n492\n00:23:45.939 --> 00:23:48.519\nand it's F9, shoot, I think I got it\n\n493\n00:23:50.515 --> 00:23:55.383\n[LAUGH] Right at the bottom there it\nsays press F9 for Setup, or F11 for\n\n494\n00:23:55.383 --> 00:24:00.496\nthe Boot menu, so I'm just rapidly\nspamming F9 at it to get that in there so\n\n495\n00:24:00.496 --> 00:24:02.910\nit'll take me into the bios.\n\n496\n00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:06.548\nNow, after that gets through,\nNetwork Boot's another option,\n\n497\n00:24:06.548 --> 00:24:10.367\nit's gonna act like it ignored my\nkeystroke, and the reason is it still has\n\n498\n00:24:10.367 --> 00:24:14.674\nto initialize the RAID controller and the\nnetwork adapter, because those are gonna\n\n499\n00:24:14.674 --> 00:24:18.249\nshow up in the BIOS, so it has to\ninitialize them, otherwise it can't\n\n500\n00:24:18.249 --> 00:24:22.285\nshow me the configuration settings for\nthem, so I'm gonna miss some of that.\n\n501\n00:24:22.285 --> 00:24:25.925\nSo it acts like it's ignoring me, but\nthen it is gonna drop into the BIOS, and\n\n502\n00:24:25.925 --> 00:24:26.659\nthere it goes.\n\n503\n00:24:26.659 --> 00:24:29.238\nSo now it's dropped me into BIOS,\nand I can see my settings and\n\n504\n00:24:29.238 --> 00:24:30.620\nstart to work with it.\n\n505\n00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:35.225\nSo looking at the BIOS in a server is\nreally not much different than on a work\n\n506\n00:24:35.225 --> 00:24:38.660\nstation, except it's usually\na little more boring.\n\n507\n00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.513\nSome of the work stations these days\nhave really fancy animations and\n\n508\n00:24:41.513 --> 00:24:44.450\nuse a mouse and stuff,\non a server it's keyboard land only.\n\n509\n00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:48.504\nAnd as you move through, you'll see\nthe description of your server over here,\n\n510\n00:24:48.504 --> 00:24:51.364\nserial number information,\nhow much memory you have.\n\n511\n00:24:51.364 --> 00:24:55.465\nThis is just a general summary for\nthe server, and then you'll see over here,\n\n512\n00:24:55.465 --> 00:25:00.230\nthe individual options that we can start\nto tweak and change and mess around with.\n\n513\n00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:04.310\nIf I just go under System Options, the\nvery first one, we'll see I can customize\n\n514\n00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:07.310\nthe serial ports,\nthe embedded network interface cards,\n\n515\n00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:11.091\nadvanced memory protection, if I wanna\nget that set up, any USB options,\n\n516\n00:25:11.091 --> 00:25:15.051\na lot of people disable the USB ports on\ntheir servers because that's an attack\n\n517\n00:25:15.051 --> 00:25:19.551\nsurface, somebody could try and break into\nthe system, processor options, and so on,\n\n518\n00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:22.228\nall of these are different\nthings that we can tweak.\n\n519\n00:25:22.228 --> 00:25:25.740\nIf I go into Advanced Memory Protection,\nfor example, well,\n\n520\n00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.180\nthat's the Advanced ECC Support.\n\n521\n00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:31.282\nWe have ECC memory in the server,\nand so when I go in here,\n\n522\n00:25:31.282 --> 00:25:35.097\nwe can choose whether we want to have\nan Online Spare for our memory, so\n\n523\n00:25:35.097 --> 00:25:38.812\nif one memory stick goes bad,\nI've got a spare that jumps right in.\n\n524\n00:25:38.812 --> 00:25:41.997\nWe can do Mirrored Memory,\nor even Lockstep Mode,\n\n525\n00:25:41.997 --> 00:25:46.445\nwhere it writes everything to two\nsticks simultaneously at all times,\n\n526\n00:25:46.445 --> 00:25:51.055\nthat way we don't have any downtime\nwhatsoever when we have memory fail.\n\n527\n00:25:51.055 --> 00:25:52.946\nSo this is where I would\ngo to configure and\n\n528\n00:25:52.946 --> 00:25:54.738\nturn that on if my server supported it.\n\n529\n00:25:54.738 --> 00:25:57.623\n&gt;&gt; Don, one of the things you\nalso mentioned is like in PCs, or\n\n530\n00:25:57.623 --> 00:26:00.456\nthe workstation BIOS,\nthere's information there, and\n\n531\n00:26:00.456 --> 00:26:03.865\nsometimes it can be grayed out,\nwhich means it's not configurable,\n\n532\n00:26:03.865 --> 00:26:08.380\nI don't notice that here, so it looks like\nalmost every bit of this is configurable.\n\n533\n00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.917\n&gt;&gt; Well what they do is if\nthere's something they don't want\n\n534\n00:26:10.917 --> 00:26:12.846\nyou to configure, they remove it, right?\n\n535\n00:26:12.846 --> 00:26:14.684\nLike overclocking,\nthey don't allow you to overclock, so\n\n536\n00:26:14.684 --> 00:26:16.120\nnone of those features show up here.\n\n537\n00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:20.881\nRemember that HP or Dell or Lenovo,\nthey made this firmware, this BIOS, right,\n\n538\n00:26:20.881 --> 00:26:25.228\nit's not like on a desktop where it's\nalmost all AMI and Phoenix, right,\n\n539\n00:26:25.228 --> 00:26:29.299\nthose two companies make the BIOS for\ndarn near every workstation, so\n\n540\n00:26:29.299 --> 00:26:34.267\nthere's features in there that are grayed\nout because they just aren't supported,\n\n541\n00:26:34.267 --> 00:26:38.090\nbut here, it was specifically made for\nthis one server, right?\n\n542\n00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:41.018\nIt's not even a common BIOS that they\nreuse over and over and over again,\n\n543\n00:26:41.018 --> 00:26:42.750\nit's different for every single server.\n\n544\n00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.952\nIf I go down to Processor Options,\n\n545\n00:26:45.952 --> 00:26:49.946\nhere's where I can see\nIntel Virtualization Technology, right,\n\n546\n00:26:49.946 --> 00:26:54.373\nIntel Hyperthreading, Intel VT-d,\nthe virtualization for disk I/O.\n\n547\n00:26:54.373 --> 00:26:58.555\nSo if I want these features on or\noff, I've got to come in here and\n\n548\n00:26:58.555 --> 00:27:02.040\nturn them on, I can see that VT-x for\nme is turned on,\n\n549\n00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.853\nlet's see if VT-d is turned on,\nVT-d is turned on also.\n\n550\n00:27:05.853 --> 00:27:08.366\nIf you go into Hyperthreading,\nit's turned on.\n\n551\n00:27:08.366 --> 00:27:12.506\nNow, I have this controversial thing where\nin some of the shows I tell people that I\n\n552\n00:27:12.506 --> 00:27:16.166\nlike to disable Hyperthreading and\nmost people don't agree with that,\n\n553\n00:27:16.166 --> 00:27:20.546\neverybody has different approaches, but I\nlike to have consistent performance out of\n\n554\n00:27:20.546 --> 00:27:24.506\nmy servers, not inconsistent, and\nwhen you have Hyperthreading turned on,\n\n555\n00:27:24.506 --> 00:27:28.646\nit can throw off your monitoring numbers\ncuz it can look like you have eight cores,\n\n556\n00:27:28.646 --> 00:27:32.426\nwhen, in reality, sometimes you have\neight cores, so I'm not a big fan of\n\n557\n00:27:32.426 --> 00:27:36.837\nHyperthreading, for people like me, we can\nturn it off right here, and there you go.\n\n558\n00:27:36.837 --> 00:27:41.751\nEven VMWare has it in one of their\nrecommendations, they recommend turning\n\n559\n00:27:41.751 --> 00:27:46.450\noff Hyperthreading on a VS-x server,\nso this where we're gonna do it.\n\n560\n00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:49.857\nSo you can customize each one of\nthose according to your needs,\n\n561\n00:27:49.857 --> 00:27:54.294\nif this isn't a virtualization server,\nthen I might not need these extensions,\n\n562\n00:27:54.294 --> 00:27:56.608\ndoesn't hurt to leave them on though, but\n\n563\n00:27:56.608 --> 00:28:00.108\nI could turn them off if I just\ndidn't want to have that enabled.\n\n564\n00:28:00.108 --> 00:28:02.965\nSome things are pretty simple, like\nwhether you want the number lock to be\n\n565\n00:28:02.965 --> 00:28:05.684\nturned on when the system boot's up,\nthat's not very exciting, but\n\n566\n00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:08.710\nsome of the other things are more\nimportant, things like power management.\n\n567\n00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.905\nDo we want power management on a server?\n\n568\n00:28:10.905 --> 00:28:14.183\nNormally, we'd say no, for\nyears and years we've said no, but\n\n569\n00:28:14.183 --> 00:28:17.820\nin recent days, they've started to\ncreate auto scaling server farms,\n\n570\n00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.516\nright, where your server farms grow and\nshrink, and instead of deleting\n\n571\n00:28:21.516 --> 00:28:25.032\na server when you shrink, instead we\ncould just put it to sleep and then\n\n572\n00:28:25.032 --> 00:28:29.090\nwake it back up when we need it again,\nand we can save a lot of power that way.\n\n573\n00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:32.099\nAnd so now we have power management in\na lot of the current servers whereas\n\n574\n00:28:32.099 --> 00:28:35.376\nwe didn't even have power management\nbefore, it just wasn't even present.\n\n575\n00:28:35.376 --> 00:28:39.150\nYour PCI interfaces,\nyou can configure and modify as needed.\n\n576\n00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:43.809\nAnd here's the one I was really looking\nfor, which is Boot Controller Order,\n\n577\n00:28:43.809 --> 00:28:46.713\nwhen this system boots,\nwhat's it going to do?\n\n578\n00:28:46.713 --> 00:28:48.790\nAnd here's my order, I've got four steps.\n\n579\n00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:52.486\nStep one is, it's gonna boot off\nof its array controller, step two,\n\n580\n00:28:52.486 --> 00:28:56.558\nit's gonna boot off of an Intel SATA\nController #1, which is embedded, so\n\n581\n00:28:56.558 --> 00:28:59.440\nI can see my RAID controller\nthat's in PCI Slot 5, and\n\n582\n00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:03.419\nthen I can see the embedded one that's\nactually a part of the motherboard.\n\n583\n00:29:03.419 --> 00:29:06.842\nNow those are the only two boot\ndevices that I've got listed here, and\n\n584\n00:29:06.842 --> 00:29:10.904\nthe other two are just the RAID controller\nand the onboard again except if you look,\n\n585\n00:29:10.904 --> 00:29:14.502\nthis one's controller number one,\nthis one's controller number two,\n\n586\n00:29:14.502 --> 00:29:17.340\nversus the array controllers\njust listed twice.\n\n587\n00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.811\nSo on the array controller,\n\n588\n00:29:18.811 --> 00:29:22.980\nthere are actually two trunk connections\non it that run to multiple hard drives,\n\n589\n00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.066\non the motherboard,\nthere's two different connectors.\n\n590\n00:29:26.066 --> 00:29:29.823\nI think one runs to the CD drive right\nnow and the other, I don't think it runs\n\n591\n00:29:29.823 --> 00:29:34.080\nanything, so basically that's kind of\nhow it's got its boot order listed.\n\n592\n00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.545\nNow there's other things, like the network\nadaptors, that are not in this list.\n\n593\n00:29:37.545 --> 00:29:40.143\nWell, that doesn't mean we're not\ngonna try and boot off of them,\n\n594\n00:29:40.143 --> 00:29:42.860\nthat's just being managed by\nthe network adaptor, not here.\n\n595\n00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:47.682\nSo when we pull up the boot menu with\nlike an F-11, we'll see it listed there.\n\n596\n00:29:47.682 --> 00:29:51.463\nAll right, and we could always come in and\ncustomize or change these, you just kind\n\n597\n00:29:51.463 --> 00:29:54.988\nof use the instructions at the bottom of\nyour screen that tell you what to hit.\n\n598\n00:29:54.988 --> 00:29:58.468\nDifferent BIOS' will do it a different\nway so you can move up and down and\n\n599\n00:29:58.468 --> 00:29:59.400\nrearrange these.\n\n600\n00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:04.020\nAll right, we've got the date and\ntime, and you can see the date and\n\n601\n00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.821\ntime on mine is actually correct, right?\n\n602\n00:30:05.821 --> 00:30:10.277\nSo, January 6, 2017, it's got 2:41,\nso that is accurate, if it wasn't,\n\n603\n00:30:10.277 --> 00:30:12.190\nI could correct it right here.\n\n604\n00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:16.058\nNow, this is accurate for\nmy local time zone For\n\n605\n00:30:16.058 --> 00:30:19.063\nBIOS we usually want to set it to UTC.\n\n606\n00:30:19.063 --> 00:30:23.602\nSo we're GMT minus five, so\nif I really wanted this to be accurate,\n\n607\n00:30:23.602 --> 00:30:27.601\nI would need to make this 19:41,\nand so now it's GMT.\n\n608\n00:30:27.601 --> 00:30:31.458\nIf you set your server BIOS in local,\nthen when Windows or Linux boots up,\n\n609\n00:30:31.458 --> 00:30:35.441\nthey don't know that it's in a time zone,\nand so they assume it's GMT, and\n\n610\n00:30:35.441 --> 00:30:37.270\nit starts to cause some problems.\n\n611\n00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:41.103\nSo you can set it however it is\nthat your standard happens to be.\n\n612\n00:30:41.103 --> 00:30:43.814\nI've already talked long enough\nthat the time's gonna be wrong, so\n\n613\n00:30:43.814 --> 00:30:47.130\nI'll have to sync a new time to it anyway,\nand most operating systems support that,\n\n614\n00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:49.490\nthey'll sync their time down\nto the hardware underneath.\n\n615\n00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:55.178\nAll right, you might have high\navailability features in your servers,\n\n616\n00:30:55.178 --> 00:30:59.000\nthings like redundant rate controllers,\nor redundant power supplies, and so\n\n617\n00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.049\nyou'll see something like this server\navailability, server security for setting\n\n618\n00:31:03.049 --> 00:31:06.869\na BIOS password, for setting a boot\npassword, there' s all sorts of different\n\n619\n00:31:06.869 --> 00:31:10.833\nthings you can do there, again, to try and\nprotect the integrity of your server.\n\n620\n00:31:10.833 --> 00:31:14.441\nYou should have physical security\ncontrols in place to take care of that,\n\n621\n00:31:14.441 --> 00:31:16.999\nthough I tend not to rely on\nthese if I don't have to,\n\n622\n00:31:16.999 --> 00:31:20.470\nyou can also configure BIOS to\noutput on the serial console.\n\n623\n00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:23.612\nIf you don't have a monitor and\nkeyboard and you're not going to hook\n\n624\n00:31:23.612 --> 00:31:26.316\na KVM up to it, how do you see\nwhat's going on in the system,\n\n625\n00:31:26.316 --> 00:31:28.182\nas far as being able to get into the BIOS?\n\n626\n00:31:28.182 --> 00:31:31.394\nIf you're using this server as an\nappliance then you'll use a serial port,\n\n627\n00:31:31.394 --> 00:31:32.840\nand you'll connect to it.\n\n628\n00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:36.256\nYou see that with a lot of routers and\nswitches, but you can do it with your\n\n629\n00:31:36.256 --> 00:31:39.224\nown servers too because you can\nturn your server into a router,\n\n630\n00:31:39.224 --> 00:31:41.297\nyou can turn it into\nan appliance like that.\n\n631\n00:31:41.297 --> 00:31:44.418\nThen we've got things like a server\nasset text, if you have asset management\n\n632\n00:31:44.418 --> 00:31:48.020\nsoftware that's collecting all your serial\nnumbers, and tracking your warranties and\n\n633\n00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.681\nstuff, you can add additional\ntext here to identify this sever.\n\n634\n00:31:50.681 --> 00:31:54.258\nWe normally put in things like a location,\nor Maybe a PO number for\n\n635\n00:31:54.258 --> 00:31:57.715\nwhat this server was purchased on,\nor warranty information.\n\n636\n00:31:57.715 --> 00:32:00.453\nYou can add all sorts of things in there.\n\n637\n00:32:00.453 --> 00:32:02.039\nAnd then our advanced options,\nthese are the ones that\n\n638\n00:32:02.039 --> 00:32:04.480\nwe're really not supposed to mess\nwith unless we know what we're doing.\n\n639\n00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.485\nAnd so when you go in here,\n\n640\n00:32:05.485 --> 00:32:09.320\nyou'll see things like setting our thermal\nconfiguration and our video options.\n\n641\n00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.637\nIf you mess around with these,\nlike messing around with the thermal\n\n642\n00:32:12.637 --> 00:32:16.070\nconfiguration, you could actually\nput the server into a mode where it\n\n643\n00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.884\ndoesn't cool properly and\nit goes on a thermo shutdown.\n\n644\n00:32:18.884 --> 00:32:21.449\n&gt;&gt; You know Don while you're\non this screen right here,\n\n645\n00:32:21.449 --> 00:32:23.791\nI noticed that it does say up there,\nwhere is it?\n\n646\n00:32:23.791 --> 00:32:26.084\nIt says, drive write cache.\n\n647\n00:32:26.084 --> 00:32:29.738\nIs that separate from what you explained\nin another episode where we've got battery\n\n648\n00:32:29.738 --> 00:32:31.642\nbacked write cache on the RAID controller,\n\n649\n00:32:31.642 --> 00:32:34.127\nis this completely separate\nfrom that RAID controller?\n\n650\n00:32:34.127 --> 00:32:36.953\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's talking about the same\nconcept, but not on the RAID controller.\n\n651\n00:32:36.953 --> 00:32:41.124\nSo this is drive write cache,\nthat's a part of the drives themselves.\n\n652\n00:32:41.124 --> 00:32:44.447\nSome of the drives that you buy these\ndays have write cache right on board and\n\n653\n00:32:44.447 --> 00:32:45.625\nyou can use it if you want.\n\n654\n00:32:45.625 --> 00:32:47.310\nSee, how this one's disabled?\n\n655\n00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:50.121\nAnd the reason it's disabled in a lot of\nstores by default is that we don't have\n\n656\n00:32:50.121 --> 00:32:52.206\na good way to monitor and\nmake sure it's working right, so\n\n657\n00:32:52.206 --> 00:32:54.010\nyou're kind of putting\nyour trust in the drives.\n\n658\n00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:56.696\nAnd what HP is saying is,\ndon't put your trust in the drives,\n\n659\n00:32:56.696 --> 00:33:00.080\nput your trust in the RAID controller,\nbecause we can monitor that.\n\n660\n00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.830\nSo if you look down here,\nI've got the imbedded SATA RAID for\n\n661\n00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:05.450\nthis particular server.\n\n662\n00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:09.050\nThat's the one that's on\nthe motherboard and it's not enabled.\n\n663\n00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.827\nSee, how it's telling me here, how if I\ntry and run this, it's going to enable it.\n\n664\n00:33:11.827 --> 00:33:15.042\nAnd I'll lose the data on my SATA\ndrives cuz it's gonna scrub them and\n\n665\n00:33:15.042 --> 00:33:16.713\nthen we get it configured and so on.\n\n666\n00:33:16.713 --> 00:33:20.371\nNow, I don't want to turn it on,\nso I'm gonna hit Esc on that.\n\n667\n00:33:20.371 --> 00:33:21.472\nBecause, if I turn it on,\n\n668\n00:33:21.472 --> 00:33:25.200\nI'm gonna have a conflict because I've\nalready got my other RAID controller.\n\n669\n00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.430\nNow, the drives have a cable that\ncan only plug into one thing, so\n\n670\n00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:30.900\nit plugs into the motherboard or\nit plugs into the RAID controller.\n\n671\n00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.697\nIf I turn this on,\nit's not gonna see my other drives.\n\n672\n00:33:33.697 --> 00:33:36.338\nSo there's no real need to\nturn this one on at all, and\n\n673\n00:33:36.338 --> 00:33:38.881\nI can just leave it as\ndisabled like it is right now.\n\n674\n00:33:38.881 --> 00:33:42.354\nBut that's where we can go in and start\nto tweak these things and change them and\n\n675\n00:33:42.354 --> 00:33:43.415\nmodify that as we need.\n\n676\n00:33:43.415 --> 00:33:47.100\nNow, you'll notice that I can't configure\nmy add in RAID controller here.\n\n677\n00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.290\nIt doesn't show up, and\nthe reason is it has its own BIOS,\n\n678\n00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:51.868\nit's got its own firmware.\n\n679\n00:33:51.868 --> 00:33:54.559\nWhen I boot the system, the RAID\ncontroller will initialize too, and\n\n680\n00:33:54.559 --> 00:33:56.167\nwe'll have to go in there and set that up.\n\n681\n00:33:56.167 --> 00:33:57.832\nBut as far as my basic BIOS settings,\n\n682\n00:33:57.832 --> 00:33:59.783\nwe've kind of seen what\nwe need to do here.\n\n683\n00:33:59.783 --> 00:34:02.428\nThe main targets for\nme, if I'm in a hurry.\n\n684\n00:34:02.428 --> 00:34:04.335\nSet the time, set the boot order, and\n\n685\n00:34:04.335 --> 00:34:08.337\nthen enable virtualization options if\nyou need it for that particular server.\n\n686\n00:34:08.337 --> 00:34:10.588\nThat's kind of the three\nthings that I go for.\n\n687\n00:34:10.588 --> 00:34:14.210\nIf I have more time on my hands though,\nI'll go through and I'll double check\n\n688\n00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:17.624\nthings like making sure that the memory\nis showing up properly, right?\n\n689\n00:34:17.624 --> 00:34:19.953\nWe've got the amount of memory right here.\n\n690\n00:34:19.953 --> 00:34:20.923\nBut you can go in and\n\n691\n00:34:20.923 --> 00:34:24.629\nfind additional options like the ECC\noption that I've showed and in a few\n\n692\n00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:29.450\nothers that get buried away in here as\nfar as like advanced performance tuning.\n\n693\n00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:33.860\nWhen you come in here you'll find,\nactually this one doesn't have that,\n\n694\n00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:38.345\nsometimes we can go through and\nset the memory speeds and characteristics.\n\n695\n00:34:38.345 --> 00:34:42.635\nSo we can define that, that's stuff if you\nhave a lot of time and you know how your\n\n696\n00:34:42.635 --> 00:34:47.265\nserver is supposed to be configured, you\ncan verify that it's been done correctly.\n\n697\n00:34:47.265 --> 00:34:51.600\nBut after this, the BIOS side is done,\nwe're ready to move on to storage.\n\n698\n00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.630\nBut I'm getting the evil eye over\nhere because I've gone over time.\n\n699\n00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.001\nLet's do this, let's stop here.\n\n700\n00:34:56.001 --> 00:34:58.576\nAnd in the next episode, we'll pick up\nwhere we're going to jump into the RAID\n\n701\n00:34:58.576 --> 00:35:00.490\nside of things,\nget the RAID controller set up.\n\n702\n00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:03.240\nI mentioned it's really important to\ndo that before we do our install cuz\n\n703\n00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.840\nit's hard to change later.\n\n704\n00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.409\nIt's not a hard thing to configure,\nwe just need to do it right now\n\n705\n00:35:07.409 --> 00:35:09.625\nwhile we don't have any\nsensitive data on this system.\n\n706\n00:35:09.625 --> 00:35:11.630\nSo that's where we'll pick up in part two.\n\n707\n00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.526\n&gt;&gt; Well all right, Don.\n\n708\n00:35:12.526 --> 00:35:14.339\nWell, you've set the stage for this one.\n\n709\n00:35:14.339 --> 00:35:17.750\nBefore we end this one, did you have any\nadditional information you might like to\n\n710\n00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.579\nthrow in this one or are we gonna go\nahead and save that for part two?\n\n711\n00:35:20.579 --> 00:35:22.467\n&gt;&gt; Always update your BIOS, right?\n\n712\n00:35:22.467 --> 00:35:25.041\nI showed you the BIOS update\non Dell's side, HP, Lenovo,\n\n713\n00:35:25.041 --> 00:35:27.374\nthey're all the same way\nthey all have BIOS updates.\n\n714\n00:35:27.374 --> 00:35:32.121\nAnd sometimes they add features, sometimes\nthey change features, fix menus and so on.\n\n715\n00:35:32.121 --> 00:35:33.443\nIt is important to update that.\n\n716\n00:35:33.443 --> 00:35:35.833\nMy server is horribly behind.\n\n717\n00:35:35.833 --> 00:35:39.615\nIt's been almost four years since this\nthings been updated, so that's a problem.\n\n718\n00:35:39.615 --> 00:35:41.497\nI need to update my firmware.\n\n719\n00:35:41.497 --> 00:35:45.081\nIf you have UEFI,\nit looks the same as this.\n\n720\n00:35:45.081 --> 00:35:47.822\nThis is traditional BIOS here, not UEFI.\n\n721\n00:35:47.822 --> 00:35:51.092\nBut if you have UEFI, you might have\nsecure boot settings in there that you\n\n722\n00:35:51.092 --> 00:35:54.770\nmight need to disable if you're not\nrunning a signed operating system.\n\n723\n00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:58.201\nBut if you're running Windows,\nRedhat, Ubuntu, they're all signed,\n\n724\n00:35:58.201 --> 00:36:00.990\nthey work great with secure booth and\nyou'll be fine there.\n\n725\n00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:04.113\nSo just a couple of extra things to\nthink about when you're in the BIOS.\n\n726\n00:36:04.113 --> 00:36:06.580\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, we appreciate\nhaving you here in the studios.\n\n727\n00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:09.687\nAnd we appreciate you, the viewer\nwatching, stick around because we just\n\n728\n00:36:09.687 --> 00:36:12.913\nbarely scratched the service in installing\nan operating system on a server.\n\n729\n00:36:12.913 --> 00:36:15.719\nSigning up for ITPro.TV, and\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n730\n00:36:15.719 --> 00:36:16.487\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n731\n00:36:16.487 --> 00:36:18.413\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n732\n00:36:18.413 --> 00:36:24.785\n[MUSIC]\n\n733\n00:36:24.785 --> 00:36:28.412\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:08.768\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.768 --> 00:00:10.534\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:10.534 --> 00:00:15.136\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another episode here at\nITProTV I'm your host Wes Bryan and in\n\n7\n00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:20.745\ntoday's episode we are continuing through\nour series on comitia's Server Plus.\n\n8\n00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:24.275\nAnd in the last part of this two-part\nseries we barely scratched the surface on\n\n9\n00:00:24.275 --> 00:00:26.730\ninstalling an operating\nsystem within a server.\n\n10\n00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.200\n&gt;&gt; So to help us round out this journey\nis none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.240\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.890\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, Wes,\n\n13\n00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.960\nready to get right back to installing\nthe operating system on this server.\n\n14\n00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.600\nAnd in the last episode,\nwe left off with storage, right.\n\n15\n00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.710\nWe did our BIOS settings.\n\n16\n00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.700\nWe kind of got things configured\nthe way we wanted there.\n\n17\n00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.390\nNow it's time to setup storage.\n\n18\n00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.990\nNow I've got my server\nrebooting right now.\n\n19\n00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.790\nAnd any time you go into BIOS,\nyou've got to reboot.\n\n20\n00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.710\nSo if we take a look at it on I'm\njust watching this boot screen.\n\n21\n00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.760\nNow I do need to keep watching it while I\ntalk because what we're going to see as it\n\n22\n00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.210\nboots up is eventually I'm going to\nsee the RAID controller initialize.\n\n23\n00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.100\nAnd when that happens I'll have a very\nbrief window of time to hit F8 on my\n\n24\n00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.150\nkeyboard in order to get into\nthe firmware of the RAID controller.\n\n25\n00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.590\nNot here, this screen.\n\n26\n00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.660\nThis is where it is booting the regular\nBIOS but then it's going to initialize\n\n27\n00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.010\nthat RAID and I'll hit I actually think\nit's F9 for this RAID controller.\n\n28\n00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.880\nThat's where it gets tricky,\n\n29\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.280\nis the little keystrokes are a little\nbit different on different systems.\n\n30\n00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.620\nSo I have to wait and see.\n\n31\n00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.735\nBut I need to get into the firmware\nof the RAID controller, and\n\n32\n00:01:22.735 --> 00:01:23.719\nthis is kinda the neat part.\n\n33\n00:01:29.644 --> 00:01:31.400\nThere's the ILO board.\n\n34\n00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.159\nPerfect, there's the RAID card.\n\n35\n00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.130\nAll right, there we go.\n\n36\n00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.480\nSo I see that it's initializing\nthe RAID controller right now, so\n\n37\n00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.990\nI'm just waiting for it to tell me that\nI can press F8, there we go, all right.\n\n38\n00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.120\nSorry, I hate being a little distracted at\nthe beginning of the episode like that,\n\n39\n00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.240\nbut I just had to get that\nkey pressed right in there.\n\n40\n00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.970\nWhat I'm doing is when\nyou boot the system,\n\n41\n00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.500\nthe motherboard expects\nhardware to be there.\n\n42\n00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.380\nBut when you're dealing\nwith a RAID controller,\n\n43\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.620\nthe physical hard drives are there but\nthe virtual hard drives aren't.\n\n44\n00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.230\nYou're creating a container, a virtual\ndrive spread across physical disks.\n\n45\n00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.280\nAnd so it doesn't know about\nthose when you power on.\n\n46\n00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.200\nSo it's got to initialize\nthe RAID controller.\n\n47\n00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.300\nThe raid controller has to load the\nconfiguration for RAID across those disks,\n\n48\n00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.560\nit has to create the virtual drive and\n\n49\n00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.300\nthen present that to the BIOS and\nthe rest of the system right?\n\n50\n00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.370\nSo all that has to happen in boot, that's\nwhy that card has to get initialized and\n\n51\n00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.170\nwe just have to kind of wait and catch it.\n\n52\n00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.450\nSo I've gotta get into\nits specific firmware so\n\n53\n00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.830\nthat I can then go in and\nstart to create the containers so\n\n54\n00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.640\nthey'll then be presented\nto the rest of the system.\n\n55\n00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.820\nIt's kind of convoluted.\n\n56\n00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.900\nBut when you boot your system up, this\nis one of the first things that happens.\n\n57\n00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.010\nNow, it's when you boot from a cold boot.\n\n58\n00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.330\nBecause if you're just\ndoing like a warm reboot,\n\n59\n00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.600\nthe RAID controller's already awake.\n\n60\n00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.710\nIt's already presenting its virtual\ncontainers and so if you do a warm reboot,\n\n61\n00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.590\na lot of times you won't even see\nthe RAID controller reinitialize because\n\n62\n00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.990\nit's already done.\n\n63\n00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.230\nBut from a cold boot,\nyou'll see that initialization and\n\n64\n00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.800\nthat's when you can jump in and\nyou can get in that configuration.\n\n65\n00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.570\nOn this one,\nI'm going to press F8 to get into it.\n\n66\n00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.250\nOn like Dell perk controllers,\nit's normally Ctrl+A to get into it, but\n\n67\n00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.640\nit'll display the message on the screen.\n\n68\n00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.730\nYou guys saw it briefly here.\n\n69\n00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.710\nYou can always rewind and pause.\n\n70\n00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.200\nI can't pause here because it's the real\nscreen, but basically, once you get in,\n\n71\n00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.650\nnow you're in your RAID controller and\nyou can start to configure things.\n\n72\n00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.090\nIf this is a brand new server\nthat's never been configured before\n\n73\n00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.260\nthe odds are they've already dropped\na container on their for you.\n\n74\n00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.700\nBut it might not be configured\nin the way you want.\n\n75\n00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.050\nThere's a lot of decisions that we\nhave to make, when we come in here and\n\n76\n00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.790\ncreate a RAID array.\n\n77\n00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.840\nIf it's not a new server,\nthen it's probably got\n\n78\n00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.970\na configuration on there that doesn't meet\nyour needs, and you wanna reset that.\n\n79\n00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.550\nBut the most common scenario for\nme Is that we buy a server,\n\n80\n00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.670\nand they ship the server and\nthe hard drive separately.\n\n81\n00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.450\nAnd that's because people pick different\nhard drive configurations all the time.\n\n82\n00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.320\nSo when you pop the drives in,\nthose drives are completely blank.\n\n83\n00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.520\nAnd when the RAID controller initializes,\n\n84\n00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.070\nit sees them as just as bunch of disks,\nright?\n\n85\n00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.290\nJBOD.\nA lot of times it'll say that, JBOD,\n\n86\n00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.610\non the screens.\n\n87\n00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.460\nThat's because there's no\nconfiguration on those disks at all.\n\n88\n00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.240\nIf I try and\ninstall an operating system on here\n\n89\n00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.550\nsome RAID controllers will just\npresent those individual drives.\n\n90\n00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.990\nYou might be tempted to do software RAID.\n\n91\n00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.910\nEven if you've got a hardware\nRAID controller right here.\n\n92\n00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.240\nIt's totally wasting resources.\n\n93\n00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.950\nI can't tell you how many times\nI've seen people do that.\n\n94\n00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.860\nBut if we go in here and configure it,\n\n95\n00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.680\nwe can create the virtual containers\nnow they're not JBOD, now they're RAID.\n\n96\n00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.470\nRight.\nRemember,\n\n97\n00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.830\nRAID is redundant array\nof independent disks.\n\n98\n00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.320\nWe're bonding all these disks together\nto create one large virtual disk or\n\n99\n00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.170\nmultiple virtual disks.\n\n100\n00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.170\n&gt;&gt; You know Don, one of the things I can\nsee right here in your RAID controller\n\n101\n00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.360\nconfiguration that I'm not familiar with\nis the manage license keys or licensing.\n\n102\n00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.920\nIs that a common thing your\nRAID controller to have\n\n103\n00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.890\na license that you have to buy or\npurchase associated with it?\n\n104\n00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.321\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like HP.\n\n105\n00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.540\nThis is one of the things\nthey do that I don't like.\n\n106\n00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.770\nHP does licensing on their RAID\ncontrollers, Dell does not.\n\n107\n00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.260\nWhen you get a Dell PERC,\n\n108\n00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.710\nit's got all the features it's gonna\nhave just baked right into it.\n\n109\n00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.710\nWith HP,\nyou can buy a $5,000 RAID controller and\n\n110\n00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.350\nit'll still require a license\nto unlock some advanced stuff.\n\n111\n00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.440\nNow you may or\nmay not need that advanced stuff.\n\n112\n00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.840\nThe advanced stuff will do\nweird thing like RAID 6 and\n\n113\n00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.640\nsome of the other odd configurations\nthat most people don't deal with.\n\n114\n00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.139\nSo if you're just trying to do a standard\nRAID array and have a battery-backed\n\n115\n00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.765\nwriter cache controller and all that,\nthey do it with base license.\n\n116\n00:05:33.765 --> 00:05:36.645\nSo, I've only got a base license on this\nsystem, I dont have the advanced one and\n\n117\n00:05:36.645 --> 00:05:38.655\nI'm not gonna worry about it either.\n\n118\n00:05:38.655 --> 00:05:41.645\nBut you can in here and you can\nhave the license if you've got one,\n\n119\n00:05:41.645 --> 00:05:44.495\nthat's what this one is for, so\nmost of you aren't gonna see\n\n120\n00:05:44.495 --> 00:05:48.280\nthat unless you're doing the HP Server in\nwhich case you'll probably will see it.\n\n121\n00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.320\nAnd that's just something you\nbuy when you buy the server,\n\n122\n00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.070\nit'll be an option you\nchoose to add that license.\n\n123\n00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.910\nBut what we're gonna see here\nare our three main settings here.\n\n124\n00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.020\nCreate logical drive, View logical drive,\nDelete logical drive.\n\n125\n00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.240\nIf this servers been put\nin production before,\n\n126\n00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.720\nI probably wanna delete\nanything that's on it, right.\n\n127\n00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.290\ni want to delete the logical\ndrives that exists.\n\n128\n00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.780\nEven if I got it brand new,\nI may know that Dell or HP or\n\n129\n00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.600\nwhoever has already put\na configuration on here.\n\n130\n00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.580\nAnd I just want to get rid of that,\ntoo, because I want to make it myself.\n\n131\n00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.660\nI know what you're thinking is,\nif it's got three drives in it and\n\n132\n00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.690\nI want to do a RAID 5 array and\nDell's already done a RAID 5 array,\n\n133\n00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.200\nmaybe I want to stick with that.\n\n134\n00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.630\nWell, the problem is which\nstripe size did they choose?\n\n135\n00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.990\nI don't know, the stripe size they\nchose may not be optimized for\n\n136\n00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.680\nour environment, so\nwe may wanna customize that.\n\n137\n00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.300\nWell, you can't really\nchange it after the fact.\n\n138\n00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.290\nSo if we do it right now,\nwe can make sure it's set the way we want.\n\n139\n00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.000\nSo I never trust a container.\n\n140\n00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.060\nNot that it's a bad container,\n\n141\n00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.970\nI just don't trust that it's\nconfigured the way that I want it.\n\n142\n00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.200\nSo it's easier to clear it out,\nand get that setup.\n\n143\n00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.620\nNow interesting thing about this is we're\ngonna apply a configuration to these\n\n144\n00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.740\ndrives.\n\n145\n00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.640\nMost modern RAID controllers store that\nconfiguration in their own memory.\n\n146\n00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.940\nSo they've got a little,\n\n147\n00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.550\nbasically like a CMOS chip on\nthe RAID controller that stores it.\n\n148\n00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.690\nBut they also store the configuration\non the drives themselves.\n\n149\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.270\nAnd that's pretty neat, because In\nthe olden days, when the configuration was\n\n150\n00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.960\njust in the controller, if I had\ndrive one, two, three and four, and\n\n151\n00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.800\nI took out drives two and three and\nswapped them around, it broke my\n\n152\n00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.150\nRAID array and it showed as two failed\ndrives and I lost the whole array, right.\n\n153\n00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.580\nThat's what would happen\nif swapped them around.\n\n154\n00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.340\nBut on modern controllers,\nthe configuration is stored on the drive.\n\n155\n00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.530\nSo, if you take two and three out and\nyou swap them around It says,\n\n156\n00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.670\nwell two is just in the wrong slot,\nbut it's okay, all the data is here.\n\n157\n00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.140\nAnd it survives it and moves on.\n\n158\n00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.180\nAnd if I take those four drives out and\n\n159\n00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.650\nI stick them in another server that\nhas a compatible RAID controller,\n\n160\n00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.430\nit'll read that and it'll preserve\nthe array and it'll carry on, which is\n\n161\n00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.340\nreally handy if you have a server failure\nand you just wanna move to a new chassis.\n\n162\n00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.770\nTake the drives out, pop it in a new one.\n\n163\n00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:48.839\nThe RAID configuration follows it.\n\n164\n00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.380\nPretty much every RAID controller made\nin the last five years does that.\n\n165\n00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.160\nAlways double check your\nvendor documentation, right.\n\n166\n00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:55.920\nIt's not a guarantee.\n\n167\n00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.200\nYou could have one that doesn't do that.\n\n168\n00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.162\nIt doesn't show\nthe configuration that way.\n\n169\n00:07:58.162 --> 00:07:59.579\nBut most of them do.\n\n170\n00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:01.297\nIt is a pretty common thing.\n\n171\n00:08:01.297 --> 00:08:05.323\nSo the configuration that it's seeing here\nMay have been loaded from the controller\n\n172\n00:08:05.323 --> 00:08:07.941\nor it may have been loaded\nfrom the drives themselves.\n\n173\n00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:11.390\nIt always trusts the drives\nover the controller.\n\n174\n00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.490\nBecause the drives may have just been\nbrought in from another system and\n\n175\n00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.785\nwe'd wanna preserve that configuration and\nnot expect to have whole address.\n\n176\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.350\nAll right, there is one more\nsetting down here at the bottom,\n\n177\n00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.360\nwhich is cache settings and\nI'll talk about that last.\n\n178\n00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.200\nThat's the battery backlight cache\nthat not every RAID controller has it.\n\n179\n00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.226\nIf your RAID controller\ncost less than 100 bucks,\n\n180\n00:08:30.226 --> 00:08:32.780\nit probably doesn't have\nbattery-backed write cache.\n\n181\n00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.840\nBut if you've got a $2,000 RAID\ncontroller, it better have\n\n182\n00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.560\na battery-backed write cache, where it's\ngot a battery stuck right on the card and\n\n183\n00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.800\nit's got extra memory, and\nthat's where your writes are occurring.\n\n184\n00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.670\nAnd it really optimizes speed and\nprotects you from power failure and\n\n185\n00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:45.210\ndata corruption.\n\n186\n00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.690\nAll right, so let's go up to\nour logical drives though and\n\n187\n00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.723\nI'm just gonna hit view logical drive\njust to see if there's anything there.\n\n188\n00:08:51.723 --> 00:08:57.487\nAnd I can see that I have a array\nto RAID set up, it's RAID5.\n\n189\n00:08:57.487 --> 00:09:02.401\nSo it's telling me I got a RAID5 array,\n931 gigs in size, so about a terabyte,\n\n190\n00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:04.850\nand there's an online spare.\n\n191\n00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.440\nSo I've got four drives in this system.\n\n192\n00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.270\nThey're 500 gigs each, so\nI've got four 500 gigs drives,\n\n193\n00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.360\nthis is two terabyte storage.\n\n194\n00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.570\nIf I take one as a spare,\nnow I'm down to 1.5 terabytes of storage.\n\n195\n00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.580\nAnd if I do RAID 5 across it,\nI lose a third of my storage to parity,\n\n196\n00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.450\nI end up with one tera, so\nthat all works out, right?\n\n197\n00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.560\nBut again that may not be what I want.\n\n198\n00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.780\nMaybe I want mirrored drives for\nmy operating system, mirrored drives for\n\n199\n00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:32.320\nmy page file, and then my data\ndrives are all coming from a SAN.\n\n200\n00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.040\nSo I don't want a RAID 5 array like this\nand I don't need a hot spare because I'm\n\n201\n00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.350\ngoing to do two mirrors,\nit's like I already have spares, right?\n\n202\n00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:42.090\nOr maybe I just want a RAID 5\narray that spans all four disks.\n\n203\n00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:46.470\nOr I only care about performance, I want\na RAID 0 array that spans all four disks.\n\n204\n00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.930\nAfter the exam they do expect you to\nknow all of the RAID standards and\n\n205\n00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:50.810\nwhat they are.\n\n206\n00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.400\nIf you've done your A+ certification\nyou've already learned those but\n\n207\n00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:59.000\njust as a quick review, RAID 0 stripes\ndata across all the disks with no parity.\n\n208\n00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.615\nSo no redundancy whatsoever,\nyou get speed benefits, no redundancy.\n\n209\n00:10:03.615 --> 00:10:06.850\nRaid 1 is a mirror,\nwe clone data between two drives.\n\n210\n00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.380\nOne drive fails, the other one is there,\nit's got all our data.\n\n211\n00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.060\nWe get perfect mirroring, but\nyou'll get any performance benefit, right?\n\n212\n00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.190\nBecause you're just writing to\nthe two disks at the same time.\n\n213\n00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.130\nYou can actually hurt\nperformance in some cases.\n\n214\n00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.520\nBut with a hardware raid controller,\nthat doesn't normally happen.\n\n215\n00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:24.372\nThen you have RAID 5,\nwhich stripes data across the disk so\n\n216\n00:10:24.372 --> 00:10:25.980\nthat maintains of parity block.\n\n217\n00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.010\nSo if you lose a drive it can actually\nrebuild what was on that drive from\n\n218\n00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.560\nparity, it'll run slower while its doing\nthat until you replace the drive and\n\n219\n00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.310\nit rebuilds that disk and\nthen it goes back to normal speed.\n\n220\n00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.490\nThat's the real problem with RAID 5,\nit can only survive one drive failure and\n\n221\n00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.080\nits slow to rebuild.\n\n222\n00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.600\nYou're at risk the whole\ntime its rebuilding, and\n\n223\n00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.680\nif you have a 2 terabyte drive that fails,\n\n224\n00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.980\nrebuilding 2 terabytes of data, that can\ntake over 24 hours, take a long time.\n\n225\n00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.040\nAnd you're at risk that whole time.\n\n226\n00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.250\nIf one more drive fails,\nyou lose data, right?\n\n227\n00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.850\nSo a lot of people moved away from RAID\n5 to get to the more advanced stuff\n\n228\n00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:58.790\nlike RAID 10.\n\n229\n00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.050\nWhere we take a bunch of drives and\nmirror them And\n\n230\n00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.830\nthen we create a RAID 0 stripe\nacross all the mirrors.\n\n231\n00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.830\nNow we can survive more than one failure,\nright?\n\n232\n00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.570\nYou couldn't survive failures two drives\nthat were mirrored, they both failed,\n\n233\n00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:12.330\nthat would cause a problem.\n\n234\n00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.920\nAnd that's where things\nlike RAID 50 come in.\n\n235\n00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:21.750\nWhere you create RAID 5 arrays and\nyou stripe across the RAID 5 arrays.\n\n236\n00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.210\nNow you've got super redundancy and you\ncan survive multiple failures that way.\n\n237\n00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:29.220\nThere's RAID 6, remaintained\ntwo parity disk instead of one,\n\n238\n00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.220\nthat way you can have a second failure.\n\n239\n00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.830\nThere's all sort of different\ntechnologies that are out there,\n\n240\n00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.300\nwhich one is right for you?\n\n241\n00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.510\nWell, that's the hard one.\n\n242\n00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.940\nFirst off, you got to figure out\nwhat your RAID controller supports.\n\n243\n00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.390\nSo I know it supports RAID 5,\nbecause I can see it's already got a disk.\n\n244\n00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:46.560\nI'm gonna delete that disk so I'm gonna\ngo in and delete the logical drive.\n\n245\n00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.060\nI'm going to take that one out and\nit's making me hit F8 to delete it.\n\n246\n00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.460\nUsually has a special character you\nhave to hit to delete it cuz they\n\n247\n00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.010\ndon't want you to accidentally do it.\n\n248\n00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:58.190\nAnd then I gotta do F3 and there we go.\n\n249\n00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.770\nIt says saving to configuration,\nit's saving it to the RAID controllers\n\n250\n00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.110\nconfiguration and\nit's saving it to the drive.\n\n251\n00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.610\nSo it's basically reaching\nout to the drives and\n\n252\n00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.330\nsaying you're not a part\nof a RAID array anymore.\n\n253\n00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:07.830\nSo there we go.\n\n254\n00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.180\nAnd then I can create a logical drive.\n\n255\n00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.970\nWell, I can view it to\nmake sure it is empty,\n\n256\n00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.500\nit's empty and then I can create one.\n\n257\n00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.810\nNow when I go to create one\nhere's where I see my choices.\n\n258\n00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:24.291\nAnd this RAID controller supports RAID 0,\nRAID 10, RAID 5, and\n\n259\n00:12:24.291 --> 00:12:29.220\nRAID 50 It doesn't support RAID 6,\nso I don't have that option.\n\n260\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.530\nIt doesn't support some of the other\nstranger standards that are out there,\n\n261\n00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.540\nit just supports these four.\n\n262\n00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.850\nSo if I want some of those other ones,\n\n263\n00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:38.400\nI'll need to get a different\nRAID controller.\n\n264\n00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.380\nOr it may be a licensed featured I have to\nadd and I don't have the license, okay.\n\n265\n00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.770\nBut here is where I see what I support.\n\n266\n00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.700\nNow from my server,\nwhich one am I gonna pick?\n\n267\n00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.120\nDepends on my needs.\n\n268\n00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.650\nIf I'm purely concerned about performance,\nthen I'm gonna go RAID 0,\n\n269\n00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.660\nit gives me the best performance.\n\n270\n00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.220\nIf I'm purely concerned\nabout the redundancy,\n\n271\n00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.880\nI'm gonna go with mirrors RAID 1.\n\n272\n00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.400\nBut notice, I don't have RAID\n1 as an option here, right?\n\n273\n00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.190\nThe reason I have RAID 1 as\nan option is that right now I've got\n\n274\n00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.020\nthree drives selected over here.\n\n275\n00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.260\nYou can't do a mirror across three drives.\n\n276\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.750\nI'd bet, if I go and\n\n277\n00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:15.510\nuncheck one of these disks, actually I\nhave four drives, just magically appeared.\n\n278\n00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.740\nI might have a drive failing if it\ntook that long to appear in the list.\n\n279\n00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.830\nBut if I go in here\nan unselect one of those and\n\n280\n00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.970\nlook, no, even then RAID 1 didn't turn up.\n\n281\n00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:29.350\nSo looks like I must not have\nthe ability to view RAID 1 on this one.\n\n282\n00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.050\nMaybe that's a licensed feature,\nwho knows.\n\n283\n00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:35.150\nBut so looking at it here, my choices\nare gonna be somewhat limited based on\n\n284\n00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:38.620\nhow many drives I pick and what my\ncontroller supports, keep that in mind.\n\n285\n00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.670\nNow if I'm building up a database server,\nI might need a mixture.\n\n286\n00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.540\nI might need a mirror for\nmy operating system, a mirror for\n\n287\n00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:50.050\nmy transaction logs and\nRAID 5 for my database files.\n\n288\n00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.390\nSo, I'm gonna need many,\nmany disks to do that.\n\n289\n00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.830\nIf your server has room for it,\nmaybe you can do it internally, and\n\n290\n00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.630\nyou'll see all your disk here and\nyou'll slice them up on how you need it.\n\n291\n00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.140\nBut most of us don't have a lot of room.\n\n292\n00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.300\nThis server only had four drive base.\n\n293\n00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.700\nSo if I want more I'm\ngonna attach to a SAN.\n\n294\n00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.960\nAnd on the SAN I'll go through and\n\n295\n00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.310\nconfigure everything\nthe way that I want it to.\n\n296\n00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:12.770\nNow when we create these containers,\na hardware RAID controller,\n\n297\n00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.430\nit's a lot different than\na software RAID controller.\n\n298\n00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.510\nSoftware RAID controllers\nlet you pick the size.\n\n299\n00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:21.120\nSo potentially you could have a RAID\n5 array that consumed half the disk.\n\n300\n00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.200\nAnd then a RAID 0 array that consumed\nthe other half on the same disks.\n\n301\n00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.630\nIt's not good for performance.\n\n302\n00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.580\nWith software RAID you've already\nscrewed performance over, so\n\n303\n00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.750\nyou don't worry about it, but\non a hardware one you do.\n\n304\n00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.470\nSo normally we're choosing\nthe entire disk, and\n\n305\n00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.850\nyou'll see it's not really\ngiving me options to pick size.\n\n306\n00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.030\nBut I do have options for other things.\n\n307\n00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.850\nLike my parity group counts,\nhow many parity groups do I wanna create.\n\n308\n00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:46.090\nMy maximum boot partitions,\nwhether I wanna enforce that or not.\n\n309\n00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:50.650\nBump it up to an 8GB max or\nkeep it at the 4GB which is the default.\n\n310\n00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.098\nNormally 4GB is plenty.\n\n311\n00:14:53.098 --> 00:14:55.283\nWe're not gonna create like a UEFI\nboot partition that's gonna be\n\n312\n00:14:55.283 --> 00:14:55.916\nlarger than that.\n\n313\n00:14:55.916 --> 00:14:57.380\nMost of them are 200 megs.\n\n314\n00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.300\nBut you might have special needs.\n\n315\n00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.240\nWe can use one drive as a spare.\n\n316\n00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.560\nSo there's an option.\n\n317\n00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.750\nI guess that'll be why it took a while for\n\n318\n00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.400\nthat other one to come in because\nit was flagged as a spare before.\n\n319\n00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.700\nSo when I go in and configure this\nthese are all options that I can pick.\n\n320\n00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.540\nSome RAID configuration utilities\nget really advanced and\n\n321\n00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:18.320\nlet you pick other things like\nthe stripe size and more details there.\n\n322\n00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.930\nDown here at the bottom is telling me for\n\n323\n00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:24.700\nmore configuration options use\nthe HP array configuration utility.\n\n324\n00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:25.620\nWhen you buy the server,\n\n325\n00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.620\nit comes with a disk that you can boot off\nof, or you can make one from the website,\n\n326\n00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.480\nthat then has a graphical utility that\nhas even more options inside of it.\n\n327\n00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.290\nSo we definitely have some choices there.\n\n328\n00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:38.460\nAll right, for me,\nI'm gonna come through and\n\n329\n00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:43.150\npick the drives that I want to enable and\nso maybe I'll do all four.\n\n330\n00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:46.940\nAnd then over here, I can pick if\nI'm gonna do RAID 5 or whatever.\n\n331\n00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.170\nMaybe I wanna have that spare.\n\n332\n00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:49.326\nI'm gonna get rid of the spare.\n\n333\n00:15:49.326 --> 00:15:51.903\nSo I'm just gonna do\na straight RAID 5 array.\n\n334\n00:15:51.903 --> 00:15:55.219\nNow I can pick RAID 5, RAID 10, RAID 0.\n\n335\n00:15:55.219 --> 00:15:57.831\nIt will not let me pick RAID 50.\n\n336\n00:15:57.831 --> 00:16:02.190\nI can't pick RAID 50 because RAID 50 would\n\n337\n00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:06.674\nrequire Six drives minimum to do that,\nright?\n\n338\n00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:11.435\nCuz you have three drives in each RAID 5\narray, and then you mirror between them,\n\n339\n00:16:11.435 --> 00:16:13.250\nso you need two.\n\n340\n00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.640\nThat's gonna limit me, or is it\nthe other way around, you mirror them?\n\n341\n00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.770\n&gt;&gt; No, you had it right,\ncuz RAID 10 is four drives.\n\n342\n00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.260\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, so I've got four\ndrives, so I can actually do RAID 10.\n\n343\n00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:25.190\nLet's do that, right, so I'll have RAID 1,\nit'll mirror the two disks and\n\n344\n00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:27.280\nit'll create a RAID 0\nstripe on top of them.\n\n345\n00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.540\nNow if I have 500 gig discs and\nI create some mirrors,\n\n346\n00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.980\nI'm gonna lose half my storage there.\n\n347\n00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.680\nAnd then a RAID 0 stripe has no parodies,\nso\n\n348\n00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.330\nI should end up with one terabyte\nof storage just like I had before.\n\n349\n00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:42.800\nBefore I had RAID 5 with a hot spare,\nand I had one terabyte of storage left.\n\n350\n00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.330\nHere I have RAID 10 and I have\na terabyte of storage, about the same.\n\n351\n00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.000\nThe difference is with RAID 5, if a drive\nfailed, my performance started to sag.\n\n352\n00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.870\nThe spare would come in and\nwe do a rebuild.\n\n353\n00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.860\nAnd then we're back to normal performance.\n\n354\n00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:58.800\nUnder a mirror, if I lost a disk,\nI'd keep running like normal, full speed,\n\n355\n00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.820\nI wouldn't have an impact.\n\n356\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.880\nAnd then I could swap the disk and\nwould have to rebuild the mirror.\n\n357\n00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.850\nBut at that point,\n\n358\n00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:09.410\nI would be vulnerable if I had another\ndrive fail, I'd be out of luck.\n\n359\n00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.740\nRAID 5 is kind of the same way, so\nnot much of a difference there.\n\n360\n00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.180\nI'll do RAID 10, why not?\n\n361\n00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:19.250\nOkay, once I get that picked,\nI just need to hit Enter to select that.\n\n362\n00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:19.910\nAnd it's telling me here,\n\n363\n00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:24.310\nI've selected a logical drive\nwith a total size of 931 gigs.\n\n364\n00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:26.830\nRemember that the measurements\nare always gonna be a little off.\n\n365\n00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:29.890\nWe talk about this a little\nbit in another episode that\n\n366\n00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:34.590\nthe way disks get measured, right.\n\n367\n00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:37.530\nThe manufacturers,\nthe people who make the disks.\n\n368\n00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:41.440\nThey're measuring the actual bits that\nare available to be stored on the disk.\n\n369\n00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.260\nBut then the operating systems,\nwhen they look at it,\n\n370\n00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.410\nthey're looking at it\nin terms of clusters.\n\n371\n00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.330\nAnd so the measurements\nare always a little bit off,\n\n372\n00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.760\nyou can never fully use a disk.\n\n373\n00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.950\nSo, if you get a true terabyte disk and\nit says 1000 right on the disk,\n\n374\n00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.945\nwhen you format it for\nyour operating system, it may be 930 gigs.\n\n375\n00:17:55.945 --> 00:18:00.481\nBecause that's what the OS can\nactually use to do cluster sizes and\n\n376\n00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:04.570\nthe other things that creates\nthat kind of division.\n\n377\n00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:09.155\nAnd then there's the whole\na kilobyte isn't 1,000 bytes,\n\n378\n00:18:09.155 --> 00:18:14.100\nit's 1,024 bytes and\nthat offsets the numbers too.\n\n379\n00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.590\nSo I'm gonna go and save that\nconfiguration, and once that's done,\n\n380\n00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.640\nit's writing it to the controller and\nto the disks.\n\n381\n00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:24.350\nNow, this controller's not gonna do it,\nbut on many controllers,\n\n382\n00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.670\nI'll then be prompted with an option\nto do what's called a scrub.\n\n383\n00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:31.950\nA scrub is where it goes through and\nwrites ones and\n\n384\n00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:35.750\nzeroes out to the discs to\nget them set toward their\n\n385\n00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:39.390\nperfectly mirror with no residual\ndata underneath them, right.\n\n386\n00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:40.768\nIt's not a full DoD wipe, but\n\n387\n00:18:40.768 --> 00:18:44.000\nit's designed to make the RAID\narray as stable as possible.\n\n388\n00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.230\nIt's a good idea to do the scrub,\n\n389\n00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:49.180\nif you get the option, it takes a long\ntime, it could take over night.\n\n390\n00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.160\nI usually start them and go home and\nthen come back the next day and\n\n391\n00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.250\nthen finish the server.\n\n392\n00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.210\nBut that makes sure that the RAID\ncontroller and the RAID array\n\n393\n00:18:55.210 --> 00:19:00.450\nconfiguration is consistent across the\ndisk that all the sectors are the same.\n\n394\n00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.230\nAnd now it's ready for\nme to start injecting data on it and\n\n395\n00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:03.570\nyou'll get the best performance out of it.\n\n396\n00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.850\nSo do the scrub if you get the option.\n\n397\n00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.640\nThis controller is actually\nnot all that terribly fancy.\n\n398\n00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.010\nSo, it's not giving me that option here.\n\n399\n00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:14.080\nAll right, now that I'm done,\nI can view that logical drive and\n\n400\n00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.840\nI can see there it is.\n\n401\n00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.320\nIt's created, I got a RAID 10 array,\nand it's okay, it's ready for me to go,\n\n402\n00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.820\nand then I'll be in business.\n\n403\n00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:24.450\nNow, remember your operating system\nis not gonna see the individual disk.\n\n404\n00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.400\nMy operating system won't\neven know this is RAID.\n\n405\n00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.550\nMy operating system is gonna\nsee a one terabyte drive, and\n\n406\n00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.620\nit won't know that there's\nactually four disks underneath.\n\n407\n00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.950\nIt won't know if there's a disk failure,\nit won't know the strip size.\n\n408\n00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.130\nAll that is hidden from\nthe operating system.\n\n409\n00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:41.970\nThat's the advantage of hardware RAID.\n\n410\n00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:44.490\nThe hardware controller\ndeals with all of it, and\n\n411\n00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.880\nthe operating system just\ntreats it like a normal disk.\n\n412\n00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.320\nThat's why you always get better\nperformance on a hardware RAID controller\n\n413\n00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.060\nthan you do software RAID.\n\n414\n00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:55.700\nSoftware RAID is terrible, never use\nit in production, especially because,\n\n415\n00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.220\neven cheap hardware RAID\ncontrollers are better.\n\n416\n00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:03.088\nSo use the one that's integrated in\nyour motherboard, if you have to.\n\n417\n00:20:03.088 --> 00:20:05.979\nBut once that's done, that's pretty\nmuch all I need to configure.\n\n418\n00:20:05.979 --> 00:20:08.380\nYou can hit Enter and\nlook at some additional details.\n\n419\n00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.990\nThis one doesn't go too far into it,\n\n420\n00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.430\nbecause they want you to use the other\nsoftware to really view the super details.\n\n421\n00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:14.900\nBut I'll go ahead and get out of here.\n\n422\n00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.170\nThe only other thing I haven't really\naddressed is the cache settings.\n\n423\n00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:18.640\nAnd if I take a look in there,\n\n424\n00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:23.100\nit's just whether I wanna enable\nthe battery override on this thing or not.\n\n425\n00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:23.810\nAnd you'll see here,\n\n426\n00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:28.260\nwe can enable it irrespective\nof battery charge state or not.\n\n427\n00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:33.800\nIf the battery is not charged,\nthen you don't wanna use the write cache.\n\n428\n00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.280\nBecause if you lose power,\nyou're gonna lose the write.\n\n429\n00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.480\nSo it's better to just let it write\nto the disk, and not use the cache,\n\n430\n00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.700\nthat's the default.\n\n431\n00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.520\nBut I can override it to always\nuse the cache, if I want.\n\n432\n00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.932\nIt's a bad idea,\nwhich is why the screen is red.\n\n433\n00:20:45.932 --> 00:20:47.600\n[LAUGH] And so I'm not gonna turn that on.\n\n434\n00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.830\nBut otherwise, it's gonna maintain that.\n\n435\n00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.860\nThat also means the battery on your write\ncache controller is something that you\n\n436\n00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.060\nneed to perform maintenance on.\n\n437\n00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.800\nEvery three years or so\nyou should be replacing that battery.\n\n438\n00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.400\nUsually in production we're replacing\nservers every three years anyway,\n\n439\n00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.010\nbut at least the battery\nneeds to be tested.\n\n440\n00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.780\nYou can take a multimeter or multimeter or\nwhatever and test the voltage on it,\n\n441\n00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.220\nmake sure that it's working right.\n\n442\n00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:11.550\nYou can cut power to the server and\nmake sure that you don't lose changes.\n\n443\n00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:15.130\nThat's a little harsher on a production\nserver, but just test it out,\n\n444\n00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.640\nmake sure that it's stable,\nit's pretty easy to maintain.\n\n445\n00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.250\nAll right,\nonce that's done my BIOS is configured,\n\n446\n00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.990\nmy Raid controller is configured.\n\n447\n00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.580\nAnd now we're ready to actually\njump into our R server install.\n\n448\n00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.700\nAnd we can get out of here,\n\n449\n00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.040\nsome RAID controllers do require you\nto reboot, not all of them, though.\n\n450\n00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.640\nThis one doesn't require a reboot.\n\n451\n00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:40.310\nAnd now that it's done, it's presenting\na virtual hard drive to my system.\n\n452\n00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:45.270\nSo, when it goes to boot, it's gonna\nboot off the installation media and\n\n453\n00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.410\nit's gonna see that one drive, right?\n\n454\n00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.590\nNow I did have an option there,\nmy last ditch menu,\n\n455\n00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:53.610\nit went by really fast where I could\nhave still gone back into BIOS.\n\n456\n00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:56.700\nOr I could have pressed F11 for\na boot menu.\n\n457\n00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.460\nF11 for a boot menu is really handy\nbecause you might not have your\n\n458\n00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:05.140\nUSB key set as your primary boot item, or\nyour CD drive as your primary boot item.\n\n459\n00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:09.140\nAnd if you have blank hard drives like I\ndo, it'll boot from the removable media.\n\n460\n00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.370\nBut if your hard drive has an OS,\n\n461\n00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.522\nit may boot from the hard drive\ninstead of the removable media.\n\n462\n00:22:12.522 --> 00:22:15.110\nPressing F11, that'll get us into that,\non this server.\n\n463\n00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:16.960\nYour keystroke might\nbe different on yours.\n\n464\n00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.750\nThe other thing is you\nmight want to network boot.\n\n465\n00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:24.610\nIf you network boot, like a Pixie,\nPixie is the pre execution environment.\n\n466\n00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.840\nAnd with Pixie, instead of having\nan install disk right here,\n\n467\n00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.470\nyour system sends a message\nout to the network and\n\n468\n00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:33.650\nsays hey, anybody out there got\nan operating system for me?\n\n469\n00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.725\nAnd if you have a server that's\nset up to receive those messages,\n\n470\n00:22:36.725 --> 00:22:39.450\nit's usually done through\nDHCP to find the server.\n\n471\n00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.540\nAnd then it pushes the operating\nsystem down here to this machine.\n\n472\n00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.720\nIt can do the install,\nyou don't even have to put a disk in it.\n\n473\n00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.490\nWe can do what are called\nzero touch installs where\n\n474\n00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.380\neverything gets automatically\nconfigured and deployed.\n\n475\n00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:54.080\nIt's really pretty neat stuff, it varies\nbased on the operating system though.\n\n476\n00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.800\nThe network adaptor is what's\nallowing us to boot from the network.\n\n477\n00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.990\nAnd it's the operating system\nthat allows the automation.\n\n478\n00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.140\nWe're going to talk about that\nmore in another episode, but\n\n479\n00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.690\nbe aware that's available.\n\n480\n00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.840\nOn this one, it's starting up Windows.\n\n481\n00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.420\nAnd it's gonna take me into\nthat Windows Installer.\n\n482\n00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.060\nAnd then I can continue\non to the installation.\n\n483\n00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.410\nNow here's where our paths\nare gonna start to diverge, right?\n\n484\n00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.150\nBecause the steps I'm\nabout to take in Windows\n\n485\n00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:21.450\nare gonna be different than\nthe steps that I take in Linux.\n\n486\n00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.060\nSo I'm gonna run through\na few different scenarios,\n\n487\n00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.710\nit'll span into the next episode.\n\n488\n00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:27.600\nBut before I get that far,\n\n489\n00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.500\nthere's something I forgot to mention\nwhile we were on the RAID controller.\n\n490\n00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.790\nI created a one terabyte drive,\neverything's gonna support that,\n\n491\n00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.080\nthat's not a big deal.\n\n492\n00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:39.170\nBut what if I had a 15 drive array\nthat was attached to this thing and\n\n493\n00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:41.630\nit was all six terabyte disks.\n\n494\n00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.470\nAnd I have over 80\nterabytes of storage and\n\n495\n00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:49.130\nI create one big 80 terabyte drive,\nis that going to be okay?\n\n496\n00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:53.030\nNot usually, you need to understand the\nlimitations of you're operating system.\n\n497\n00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:54.857\nOperating systems have\ntheir own requirements.\n\n498\n00:23:54.857 --> 00:23:57.562\nThey may not support\ndrives of a certain size.\n\n499\n00:23:57.562 --> 00:24:01.176\nIf I go into the hard core\narray configuration utility and\n\n500\n00:24:01.176 --> 00:24:05.103\nI start setting block sizes and\nstuff like that on the drives.\n\n501\n00:24:05.103 --> 00:24:09.230\nI can set values that might not work for\nmy operating system.\n\n502\n00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:12.750\nSo as we configure the array controller,\nyou've gotta understand that,\n\n503\n00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:13.760\nwhat your operating system can do.\n\n504\n00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.090\nAnd on the operating system side, it's\nusually gonna come down to file system.\n\n505\n00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.230\nSo let's talk about file systems for\na minute.\n\n506\n00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:22.150\nIn Windows, it's easy cuz in Windows\nwe really just have one file system\n\n507\n00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.000\nthese days and that's NTFS.\n\n508\n00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.520\nNTFS is the New Technology File System.\n\n509\n00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.748\nI think we're on NTFS version 4 now.\n\n510\n00:24:28.748 --> 00:24:32.700\nIt's been around a long time and\nit supports huge drive,\n\n511\n00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.668\nseveral petabytes in size.\n\n512\n00:24:34.668 --> 00:24:38.480\nAnd it supports volumes\nthat are fairly large.\n\n513\n00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.690\nI think it caps out at 32 terabyte,\nif I remember right.\n\n514\n00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.370\nThis is something like that.\n\n515\n00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:44.990\nBut it can handle pretty large things.\n\n516\n00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:49.890\nSo if I start to create large volumes,\nI'll be okay in Windows if I'm using NTFS.\n\n517\n00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:55.830\nBut Windows also supports FAT32,\nthe old file allocation table format.\n\n518\n00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:58.300\nAnd exFAT, and a few other formats.\n\n519\n00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.830\nAnd those guys- Well,\nexFAT's fine, but FAT32,\n\n520\n00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.090\nit doesn't play nice with large drives.\n\n521\n00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.930\nIf you have a drive more than,\nwell, it use to be four gigs.\n\n522\n00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.780\nIf it was larger than four gigs,\nit really freaked out.\n\n523\n00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.410\nAnd then there was the other limit that\nwas a hundred and ninety some odd gigs,\n\n524\n00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:13.230\nbefore they updated that.\n\n525\n00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:16.440\nSo now it's around two terabytes,\nwhere it starts to get angry.\n\n526\n00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.210\nSo, you can run into a situation there,\nwhere based on the file system you use,\n\n527\n00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.210\nyou have a problem.\n\n528\n00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:26.010\nSo as you're building your RAID controller\nconfiguration, as you're building\n\n529\n00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.300\nthe containers, you need to think about\nthe file system you're gonna use.\n\n530\n00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.000\nAnd say, all right, if I'm running NTFS,\nI can make these pretty big, or\n\n531\n00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000\nin the Linux world Hey if I'm using ZFS,\nright.\n\n532\n00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.910\nZFS, a lot of distributions\nhave switched to that,\n\n533\n00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:40.880\nit can handle some pretty big stuff.\n\n534\n00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.280\nIn the Red Hat world, you don't\nhave official support for ZFS yet.\n\n535\n00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:49.090\nThey're moving towards BTRFS, but\nthat's not fully authorized yet.\n\n536\n00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:52.160\nSo they're normally doing EXT4, right.\n\n537\n00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:56.440\nEXT2, 3, and 4, they support\nsome really big partitions too,\n\n538\n00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.520\nnot a whole lot of concerns there.\n\n539\n00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.860\nIf you're on EXD2, you really\nshould be moving to EXD3 anyway.\n\n540\n00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:06.170\nBut if you're running something like UFS,\nthe old Unix file system, well,\n\n541\n00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:10.780\nmost Linux issue support UFS and\nUFS does not like huge volumes.\n\n542\n00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.800\nSo make sure you look up what file\nsystem you're gonna be running and\n\n543\n00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.600\nmake sure you create containers\nthat match that size,\n\n544\n00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.780\notherwise you might exceed\nwhat it can handle.\n\n545\n00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.530\nCompTIA calls out a few other\nfile systems to be familiar with.\n\n546\n00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.330\nSo let me just hit these for completeness.\n\n547\n00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:31.380\nThey call it ReiserFS, nobody really uses\nReiserFS anymore, that project's died off.\n\n548\n00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.600\nIt was really known for\nthe fact that it had journaling.\n\n549\n00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.800\nIt was one of the first file\nsystems to have journaling.\n\n550\n00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.440\nSo that you don't write.\n\n551\n00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.950\nWhen you change a file,\nyou don't actually change that file.\n\n552\n00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:43.710\nYou change something in a journal,\nin a log somewhere else.\n\n553\n00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.680\nAnd only when you're completely\ndone writing that change\n\n554\n00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.390\nis it then applied to the actual file.\n\n555\n00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:52.460\nSo if there's a power outage while you're\nwriting, the original file stays intact,\n\n556\n00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.030\nit doesn't get damaged.\n\n557\n00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:54.390\nIt's a great feature.\n\n558\n00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.400\nWell, then move that\ninto other file systems.\n\n559\n00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.820\nSo if you have EXT3 and EXT4,\nthey do journaling now.\n\n560\n00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.980\nSo in the Linux world, ReiserFS\nkinda came and went pretty quickly.\n\n561\n00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:09.190\nBTRFS also has it built in, and\nthat's the one people are moving to.\n\n562\n00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:10.050\nUFS I already mentioned.\n\n563\n00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:11.680\nMost people don't run UFS anymore.\n\n564\n00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.890\nAnd then VMFS,\nwhich is the VMWare file system.\n\n565\n00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:18.990\nSo if you have ESXI servers,\nthey create VMFS partitions.\n\n566\n00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:23.630\nAnd if you check VMWare's documentation\nwith each version of ESXI, they change\n\n567\n00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:27.510\nthe limitations of how large a volume and\nhow large a container it can recognize.\n\n568\n00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:30.380\nSo make sure that you're following\nthe compatibility settings for\n\n569\n00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:34.540\nthe file system you're gonna be using.\n\n570\n00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.490\nLet's see,\nthe other thing worth mentioning here\n\n571\n00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:39.000\nis if I'm dealing with a swap file.\n\n572\n00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.480\nMost servers these days come with so\n\n573\n00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:46.660\nmuch memory that we don't really\nleverage a swap file anymore.\n\n574\n00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.930\nBut, if you do, if you're leveraging that,\nif you have a low memory server and\n\n575\n00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:54.660\nyou need to be able to page to a disc\nin case you run out of RAM, then\n\n576\n00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:59.530\nbe aware that page files don't\nreally like to be on parodied disks.\n\n577\n00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:02.280\nSo things like RAID 5 or RAID 50.\n\n578\n00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.300\nPage files really don't play nice with\nthat because they're constantly changing\n\n579\n00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.090\nand parodies constantly\nbeing recalculated.\n\n580\n00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:08.720\nIt kind of puts a burden on the system.\n\n581\n00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.960\nSo, if you get a page file they always\nplay a lot more nicely on a mirror\n\n582\n00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.870\nbecause they can write a lot\nfaster to a mirror and\n\n583\n00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:16.580\nthey can be read from\na lot faster on a mirror.\n\n584\n00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:21.180\nSo the mirrors are gonna work out\na little bit better or Raid 0 even.\n\n585\n00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.150\nRAID 0's nice.\n\n586\n00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:24.280\nIf you lose a disk,\nyou lose the whole array.\n\n587\n00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.050\nBut it's just the page file,\nit's stuff that was in RAM.\n\n588\n00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:29.970\nSo it's not like you lost data that\nwas written to the disk already.\n\n589\n00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:31.920\nIf you've got transactions\nyou're working on in RAM,\n\n590\n00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.780\nlike in a database, it'll roll\nthose back after you come back up.\n\n591\n00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.930\nThat's where journaling comes in,\nor transaction logs.\n\n592\n00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.060\nSo you're kinda protected on that.\n\n593\n00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.650\nBut just know that swap files typically\nyou handle a little bit differently,\n\n594\n00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:43.610\nif you're still using them.\n\n595\n00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.545\nMost of us have kind of stop using them.\n\n596\n00:28:45.545 --> 00:28:47.470\nThey're still there, but\nthey just don't get touched, so\n\n597\n00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.764\nwe don't worry about their performance.\n\n598\n00:28:49.764 --> 00:28:52.510\nAll right,\nnow when I get into my installer here,\n\n599\n00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:55.320\nI'm just gonna walk through a little\nbit of this here in Windows.\n\n600\n00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:59.780\nThat inside of the installer,\nit's gonna offer to install Windows.\n\n601\n00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:03.020\nAnd most of the screens we see\nare licensing screens like hey,\n\n602\n00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.310\ndid you pay us enough money?\n\n603\n00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:09.220\nAnd can you completely waive\nthe right to sue us no matter what?\n\n604\n00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.160\nBut the screen that I care about is\ngonna come up here in just a moment\n\n605\n00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.700\nwhere it asks me to configure\nmy hard drives, right.\n\n606\n00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:20.620\nAnd so when I go to configure\nthe hard drive, I have to tell it\n\n607\n00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:25.630\nwhat volumes or partitions I want to\ncreate to be able to support my system.\n\n608\n00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:30.080\nAnd so when I come through here,\nI see the disk, Disk 0,\n\n609\n00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.540\nunallocated space,\n931 GB in size, completely empty.\n\n610\n00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.870\nOkay, now the nice part about this is\n\n611\n00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:41.310\nI don't know that there's\na RAID controller under there.\n\n612\n00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:44.450\nI don't know that there's four disks\nconfigured as a RAID 10 array.\n\n613\n00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:45.630\nI don't know about any of that.\n\n614\n00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.560\nThe operating system is unaware.\n\n615\n00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.820\nAnd it won't be aware until after I'm done\nwith install and I load drivers in, right?\n\n616\n00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.730\nWhen we put drivers in, now it'll\nbe able to see the RAID controller.\n\n617\n00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:57.320\nAnd that's important\nbecause we need reporting.\n\n618\n00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.100\nWe need to know about it.\n\n619\n00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.730\nAnd we can adjust the configuration.\n\n620\n00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:04.010\nBut just the base install here, it just\nsees it as a disk and I can install on it,\n\n621\n00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:04.770\nand treat it like normal.\n\n622\n00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:06.310\nI can create volumes if I want to.\n\n623\n00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:11.680\nI can do whatever it is that I need when\nwe get that configured and in place.\n\n624\n00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:17.090\nHowever, there are times where you'll get\nto this screen and no drives show up.\n\n625\n00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:19.020\nIf no drive shows up,\n\n626\n00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.460\nthat means your operating system\ndoesn't support the Raid controller.\n\n627\n00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.000\nAnd you're not out of luck.\n\n628\n00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.610\nYou just need to load a driver.\n\n629\n00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:27.690\nI got cool double mouse.\n\n630\n00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:29.640\nI can do twice as much work\nwith two mouse pointers.\n\n631\n00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.010\nBut [LAUGH] it's the remote\nconsole is cloning my mouse.\n\n632\n00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:36.370\nBut down here at the bottom left,\nyou'll see Load Driver in\n\n633\n00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:42.740\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux, in Ubuntu,\nin Windows Servers 2008, 2012, 2016.\n\n634\n00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:43.820\nThey all have it.\n\n635\n00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.260\nYou can load Raid drivers\nduring the installation.\n\n636\n00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:50.090\nAnd you might need to just to be able to\nsee the disks that are attached to it.\n\n637\n00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:52.460\nIt's no different than any kind\nof custom hard drive controller.\n\n638\n00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.280\nWhere you just have to have\ndrivers to be able to see it, and\n\n639\n00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.010\nonce you do, you can choose it,\ndo the install, and you'll be in business.\n\n640\n00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:01.940\nSo, if your system doesn't see a drive,\ngo to the vendor's website,\n\n641\n00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.120\ndownload the driver, put it on a USB key.\n\n642\n00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:08.010\nStick it on the server, and then you'll\nbe able to load that driver, browse,\n\n643\n00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:09.410\nget it installed, and\nyou'll be in business.\n\n644\n00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.050\nBut for me, the driver shows up.\n\n645\n00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:15.840\nIf you've got a Dell or an HP or\na Lenovo, Microsoft's really good about\n\n646\n00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:20.070\nsupporting their adapters, and\nso that's all you really need.\n\n647\n00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:21.100\nAnd then your install's gonna go.\n\n648\n00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.450\nAnd then you'll do all your\ncustomization stuff afterwards.\n\n649\n00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:28.490\nIf you created five or six containers,\nat this stage you're normally only\n\n650\n00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:31.300\ndealing with one of them,\nthe one where the operating system goes.\n\n651\n00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.230\nAnd after the operating system is up,\nwe lower our drivers, and then we\n\n652\n00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:37.360\ncan figure the other drives, and get them\nformatted, and all of the stuff set up.\n\n653\n00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.470\nBut for right now, this is just\nenough to get the OS going, and\n\n654\n00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:41.900\nthen we can tidy up the rest later.\n\n655\n00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:45.750\nAlright.\nWell, Wes, what's gonna come up next is\n\n656\n00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:49.577\nwe're gonna run into the actual kind\nof basic configuration of getting\n\n657\n00:31:49.577 --> 00:31:54.190\nan operating system up going on a network,\nbut we're way overtime for this episode.\n\n658\n00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:56.724\nSo were save that for the next one and\nwe'll get in there and\n\n659\n00:31:56.724 --> 00:31:58.948\nget a chance to see how to\nget those configured, and\n\n660\n00:31:58.948 --> 00:32:01.940\nget our servers closer to\nbeing moved into production.\n\n661\n00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:05.070\n&gt;&gt; Well, that sounds like a lot of fun and\nI look forward to seeing that.\n\n662\n00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:08.690\nYeah, that ZFS,\nit's an amazing file system and, in fact,\n\n663\n00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:10.930\nits scalability is just mind boggling.\n\n664\n00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:14.210\nI mean,\nwe're talking 256 quadrillion zettabytes.\n\n665\n00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:16.110\nKind of give you an idea,\nthat's 2 to 148th power.\n\n666\n00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:19.120\nThat's the same amount\nof IP addresses as IPv6.\n\n667\n00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.860\n&gt;&gt; The biggest challenge\nis ZFS Oracle's licensing.\n\n668\n00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:25.530\nOracle has a lot of it locked up in weird\nlicenses, it's not GNU and so that's why\n\n669\n00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:28.810\nwe're seeing resistance otherwise\neverybody would be running ZSF right now.\n\n670\n00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:29.420\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n671\n00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.170\nWell Don, do you have anything else you'd\nlike to throw on this one before we wrap\n\n672\n00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:34.330\nthis one up and move into our part three?\n\n673\n00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:34.970\n&gt;&gt; That's about it,\n\n674\n00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:37.900\neverything we've seen up until now\nis pretty much been OS neutral.\n\n675\n00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.270\nRight, I know we use Windows but\n\n676\n00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.630\nit was the same on Linux as\nfar as what I'm configuring.\n\n677\n00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:44.480\nWhat we're gonna go into in the next\npart is where we're gonna have\n\n678\n00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.450\nthe deviate on the OS's.\n\n679\n00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:47.030\nSo just know up until this point,\n\n680\n00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:50.360\neverything's pretty much consistent\nregardless of what OS you're deploying.\n\n681\n00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.070\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nWell, Don,\n\n682\n00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:54.300\nwe appreciate having you here and\nwe appreciate the viewers watching.\n\n683\n00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.545\nKeep in mind, stick around because we are\ngoing into a part three in installing your\n\n684\n00:32:57.545 --> 00:32:59.720\noperating system on a server.\n\n685\n00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.710\nThank you for joining us.\n\n686\n00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.020\nI've been your host Wes Bryant.\n\n687\n00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:02.920\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n688\n00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.770\n&gt;&gt; See you next time.\n\n689\n00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:11.372\n[MUSIC]\n\n690\n00:33:11.372 -->

00:00:08.255\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.255 --> 00:00:11.635\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.635 --> 00:00:15.375\n&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone, and welcome to\nanother great episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:16.851\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and\n\n7\n00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:20.691\nin today's episode, we're continuing\nthrough our series in CompTIA Server+.\n\n8\n00:00:20.691 --> 00:00:25.911\nJoining us back in the studios for a part\nthree on installing a server is Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:27.060\nDon, how are you doing sir?\n\n10\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.930\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes,\n\n11\n00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.690\nready to pick back where I left off and\nactually get a server installed.\n\n12\n00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.210\nAt the end of the last episode, if you\ndidn't watch it, we had taken a physical\n\n13\n00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.960\nserver and, well, started an operating\nsystem installation on it, right?\n\n14\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.530\nWe configured our BIOS,\nwe configured our raid controller,\n\n15\n00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.810\nset up our containers, and\nthen got to your installation.\n\n16\n00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.010\nNow during that episode I\nwas using Microsoft Windows.\n\n17\n00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.460\nNow, if you've ever\ninstalled Microsoft Windows,\n\n18\n00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.530\nyou know that you basically click\nNext three times and it's done.\n\n19\n00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.900\nIt's the least exciting\ninstallation ever and\n\n20\n00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.740\nit doesn't give you a whole\nheck of a lot of options.\n\n21\n00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.590\nSo, what we saw in that episode\nreally were all the options we had\n\n22\n00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.780\nduring the install.\n\n23\n00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.540\nWhat I wanted to do in this episode\nIs kinda switch gears a bit and\n\n24\n00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.070\ngo to the installation\nusing Linux instead.\n\n25\n00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.829\nWith Linux it exposes a lot more choices\nand options to us that help us to make\n\n26\n00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.523\nsure we get the operating\nsystem deployed properly.\n\n27\n00:01:14.523 --> 00:01:18.287\nNot that Microsoft doesn't want\nyou to deploy Windows properly.\n\n28\n00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:21.363\nThe way that Microsoft treats\nit is a little bit different.\n\n29\n00:01:21.363 --> 00:01:22.213\nWhat they say is,\n\n30\n00:01:22.213 --> 00:01:26.360\nlook, we're just gonna have one\nstandard install that everybody does.\n\n31\n00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.460\nOnce the install is done, then you can\ncustomize it according to your needs\n\n32\n00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.150\nonce the server is up and you've got the\nfull suite of utilities available to you.\n\n33\n00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.100\nOn the Linux side,\nthey go different and they say,\n\n34\n00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.670\nlook, we're gonna let you customize\nit during the installation.\n\n35\n00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.520\nSo that the final product you get\nafter it's installed is actually\n\n36\n00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.380\npretty close to ready\nto go into production.\n\n37\n00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.180\nSo, it's just two different\nways of looking at it, but\n\n38\n00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.620\nit makes the install a little\nmore exciting on the Linux side.\n\n39\n00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.090\nSo, that's what we're gonna\ntake a look at, right here.\n\n40\n00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.510\nSo I've got a Red Hat Linux\ninstall starting up here and RHEL,\n\n41\n00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.580\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux is the basis of\nCentOS as well as Fedora, so if you're\n\n42\n00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.140\ndoing installs of those, they'll look\nthe same If you're doing something like\n\n43\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.030\nUbuntu or Debian, they don't look too much\ndifferent either during the install phase.\n\n44\n00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.460\nWhere things get different\nis after they fire up.\n\n45\n00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.510\nBut when you start a Linux install, you\nusually get a screen like this that'll ask\n\n46\n00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.930\nyou if you wanna do the installation or\ntest the media and do the installation.\n\n47\n00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.950\nNow, What's that test\nthe media stuff talking about?\n\n48\n00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.480\nWhen we do an install, we're installing\nmay be from a USB key, or a CD or DVD,\n\n49\n00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.230\nmay be we're installing over the network.\n\n50\n00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.300\nIf it's over the network, you can\ntrust that the data is intact, right,\n\n51\n00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.070\nbinary data going over the network.\n\n52\n00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.260\nBut if it's a CD, it could get scratched.\n\n53\n00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.400\nIf it's a USB key, well,\nyou can only write to a USB key so\n\n54\n00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.900\nmany times and\neventually it starts to wear out\n\n55\n00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.730\nThe lifetime of that USB key\ncan be reaching its end.\n\n56\n00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.780\nIf you have a damaged media,\nwhat's gonna happen during your install?\n\n57\n00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.110\nYou're gonna get a failure,\nhopefully, right?\n\n58\n00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.350\nWorse case scenario, the install goes\nfine, but there were corrupted files that\n\n59\n00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.190\ngot copied over, and you don't know about\nit until the server's in production, and\n\n60\n00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.110\nyou start getting random lock-ups and\nthings like that.\n\n61\n00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.410\nSo verifying the media is where\nI read across the disk and\n\n62\n00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.830\nverifying checks on across the files to\nmake sure that none of them are damaged.\n\n63\n00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.330\nIf it's a scratch disk it\nwill find then what you know.\n\n64\n00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.980\nIn my case I'm installing for USB key\nthat I just made so I'm pretty sure it's\n\n65\n00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.340\nfine I'm not gonna run my test but in real\nI'm in a production server that would Don,\n\n66\n00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.940\nI know that when you download media and\nstuff in a Linux world, right?\n\n67\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.450\nAnd most software you have checks in and\n\n68\n00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.860\nstuff, you download that file and\nthen you run it through the checks in.\n\n69\n00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.370\nWhen you're talking about testing\nthe medium is this going a little bit,\n\n70\n00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.110\nmedia excuse, is this going a little\nbit farther than just the checks among\n\n71\n00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.920\nthe other overall ISO than actually\nchecking the individual components?\n\n72\n00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.370\nYeah the majority of the time,\nit does depend on the distro,\n\n73\n00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.380\nthey can each handle it differently,\nbut it's usually checking the checks on\n\n74\n00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.220\nevery single file which it can\ntake a little while, right.\n\n75\n00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.170\nThis process you let it run through, it\ncan take five or six minutes, sometimes,\n\n76\n00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.410\ndepending on the speed of your\ndrive it can take longer.\n\n77\n00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.890\nIf you're actually on a DVD,\nit can take a really long time.\n\n78\n00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.850\nIf you're on a USB key,\nit's usually just five or six minutes.\n\n79\n00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.460\nIn my case though, this is gonna be\nsuper fast cuz I'm not going to do it.\n\n80\n00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.240\nSo I'm gonna choose, do the install.\n\n81\n00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.760\nAnd that'll take us to our actual process.\n\n82\n00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.930\nNow, when the installer launches,\n\n83\n00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.490\nyou're not gonna see a whole\nheck of a lot to begin with.\n\n84\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.330\nI'm getting a little message here\nthat says press enter to begin\n\n85\n00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.540\nthe install process.\n\n86\n00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.160\nBut, what's actually going on right now is\njust testing the figure out whether I can\n\n87\n00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.720\ndo the graphical install or whether\nI need to do the text based install.\n\n88\n00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.830\nIn the Windows world, you have\na graphical install and that's it,\n\n89\n00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.800\nin the Linux world though you might\non a server that doesn't have\n\n90\n00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.910\na very good graphics card at all because\nservers we don't care about graphics and\n\n91\n00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.200\nso We're gonna be using shell connections\nand text based terminals on that unit,\n\n92\n00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.750\nwe might not be able to be run\non the graphical interface.\n\n93\n00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.850\nIf you can't, we've got the text\ninstaller, that will get launched, and\n\n94\n00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:48.790\nthat's what we'll use.\n\n95\n00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.650\nBut if you can support\nthe graphical one it's much easier.\n\n96\n00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.930\nAnd so mine's loading and here we go,\nwe can see we've got the graphic one.\n\n97\n00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.370\nNow it is using a very scaled\ndown video card driver.\n\n98\n00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.730\nNotice the big black bars I've got\non the side of my screen over here?\n\n99\n00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.670\nAnd over here on the other side.\n\n100\n00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.730\nWell, that's because it's only\nsupporting four by three right now and\n\n101\n00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.770\nI'm on a 16 by nine monitor so\nI get these black bars on the side.\n\n102\n00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:11.530\nI'm okay with that.\n\n103\n00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.200\nWhen the installer's\ndone it'll fill it out.\n\n104\n00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.930\nBut even if it didn't, I'm okay with\nit because this is gonna be a server.\n\n105\n00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.640\nI don't care about how it looks on\nthe screen cuz I'm never going to look at\n\n106\n00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.560\nthat screen.\n\n107\n00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.360\nI'm gonna use shell connections, and\nthings to remotely manage it, so\n\n108\n00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.830\nthis isn't gonna matter to me.\n\n109\n00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.070\nBut for right now,\nI'll put up with the black bars.\n\n110\n00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.820\nAnd the first thing it's gonna\nask is just about language.\n\n111\n00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.080\nNow, with any operating system,\n\n112\n00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.670\nwhen you go to install it, always pay\nattention on these language screens.\n\n113\n00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.150\nBecause sometimes it's\njust like this is saying,\n\n114\n00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.880\nwhat language did you want to\nuse during the install process?\n\n115\n00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.730\nOther times it's what language do you want\nthe actual server to use once it's done\n\n116\n00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.600\ninstalling, which we'll see in a moment.\n\n117\n00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.510\nThat's important because it\nwill tie in the localization.\n\n118\n00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.370\nAnd localizations, well, actually,\nlet me just advance this screen so\n\n119\n00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.190\nwe can get to the localization stuff.\n\n120\n00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.530\nThe localizations are going to determine\nthings like your currency symbol.\n\n121\n00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.760\nRight, in the United States we\nuse the dollar sign which is\n\n122\n00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.080\na S with a line through it.\n\n123\n00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.830\nIn Europe, they have the Euro sign\nwhich is like a stylized e or\n\n124\n00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.920\na c with two lines through it, you might\nbe in Japan and have the Yen, or whatever.\n\n125\n00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.960\nYou have different currency symbols.\n\n126\n00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.850\nBut there's other changes that\nare even more significant,\n\n127\n00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.570\nlike here in the US, if I write a decimal.\n\n128\n00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.080\nSo if I say that pi is 3.14.\n\n129\n00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.880\nThat point is a period.\n\n130\n00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.910\nSo I write three period one four.\n\n131\n00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.460\nBut in Europe its a comma.\n\n132\n00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.280\nIt would be three comma one four right.\n\n133\n00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.440\nA different region have different needs.\n\n134\n00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.150\nAnd so\nthat localization is [INAUDIBLE] Port.\n\n135\n00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.140\nAnd the other thing is\nyour keyboard layout.\n\n136\n00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.230\nWhen you pick that language,\n\n137\n00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.130\nsome operating systems will\nchoose your keyboard layout.\n\n138\n00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.930\nBased on that.\n\n139\n00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.320\nSo for example,\nmy keyboard is a QWERTY keyboard.\n\n140\n00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.390\nQ W E R T Y are all right next\nto each other in the top row.\n\n141\n00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.850\nBut if I were in France,\nthey use an AZERTY keyboard.\n\n142\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.200\nSo it's A Z E R T Y in the top row.\n\n143\n00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.540\nSo choosing that language could make\nyour keyboard start to misbehave and\n\n144\n00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.380\nthat could cause problems.\n\n145\n00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.380\nSo always pay attention on that one.\n\n146\n00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.200\nOn this next screen though is where\nI actually get the localization for\n\n147\n00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.610\nLinux, two separate screens.\n\n148\n00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.860\nSo I've got my date and time,\nI've got my language support for\n\n149\n00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.470\nthe on-screen language,\nand my keyboard mapping.\n\n150\n00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.890\nAnd it's all defaulting\nto English United States.\n\n151\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.180\nnot because it has some super secret\nmethod of knowing I'm in the US, but\n\n152\n00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.620\nbecause Red Hat is a US company.\n\n153\n00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.160\nSo that's what it defaults to.\n\n154\n00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.860\nBut if I were in France I\nwould want to come in here and\n\n155\n00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.410\nchange each of these to reflect\nwhat those values were.\n\n156\n00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.080\nIt gives me the options\nof setting the time.\n\n157\n00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.980\nAnd a lot of people\ndon't worry about this.\n\n158\n00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.140\nBecause they say look I'm on\nuse the time server anyway.\n\n159\n00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.530\nSo they'll just set their\nself down the road.\n\n160\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.290\nBut the timezone is really important.\n\n161\n00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.690\nYes your system will likely synchronize\nI guess another time server.\n\n162\n00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.300\nBut if it's in the wrong time zone\nthe clock might appear wrong.\n\n163\n00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.530\nSo you want to make sure that\nthe time zone is correct.\n\n164\n00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.340\nMine is showing that I'm in\nthe New York time zone which is fine,\n\n165\n00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.640\nwe're in Florida right down here so\nthat's where we're at.\n\n166\n00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.666\nBut we can choose you know\nwhatever was appropriate for\n\n167\n00:07:53.666 --> 00:07:56.310\nwhere we're at to get us\nin the right time zone.\n\n168\n00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.880\nThe other thing is you can\nset your time here but,\n\n169\n00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.501\nif you're going to use a network time\nserver you don't have to worry about that.\n\n170\n00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:01.170\nIt'll grab it.\n\n171\n00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.979\nNotice I've got the option up here\nNetwork time and it's turned off.\n\n172\n00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:08.087\nSo if I wanna use the network\ntime server I can specify one.\n\n173\n00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:10.240\nIt's using the Red Hat servers by default.\n\n174\n00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.020\nI could switch to something\nelse if I wanted to.\n\n175\n00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.520\nThese are actually fired off of ntp.org.\n\n176\n00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.180\nBut it's up to you what you wanna use.\n\n177\n00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.240\nI'm gonna flip that on.\n\n178\n00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.020\nAnd that way I won't\nhave to worry about it.\n\n179\n00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.580\nI tried to flip it on and\nit went immediately to off.\n\n180\n00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.060\nThat's usually a good indicator that\nit doesn't have the drivers for\n\n181\n00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.000\nmy network adapter, right?\n\n182\n00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.120\nYou don't have a ton of drivers\nloaded during the installation.\n\n183\n00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.510\nAnd I might have hardware that's\nnot supported by the installer,\n\n184\n00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.020\nwhich means I'm not gonna be able to\nuse something like a time server.\n\n185\n00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.480\nAfter my install is done I can\nadd the driver for that hardware,\n\n186\n00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.620\nand then we'll be in business.\n\n187\n00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.520\nBut for right now it looks like\nI'm gonna have to deal with that\n\n188\n00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.420\na little bit later because it\nis not let me switch that to on.\n\n189\n00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.680\nYeah, so\nI must not have my network hard driver.\n\n190\n00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:59.510\nAll right we have a few other things\nthat we can set here that are basic\n\n191\n00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.040\nsecurity practices, right?\n\n192\n00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.810\nWith systems like Microsoft Windows.\n\n193\n00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.600\nThey have a Windows firewall,\nthey have a set up permissions,\n\n194\n00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.760\nthey have user account control.\n\n195\n00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.890\nThese are all security features that\nare part of the operating system.\n\n196\n00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.930\nWith Linux, you have various things too.\n\n197\n00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.240\nAnd in Red Hat specifically,\nyou have something called SC Linux,\n\n198\n00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.550\na security sub layer.\n\n199\n00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:22.380\nAnd it's asking me to pick which\nsecurity policy it's going to use.\n\n200\n00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.600\nBy default no policy.\n\n201\n00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.370\nSo if I intend to take advantage\nof that security feature,\n\n202\n00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.270\nI need to click on that and\nchoose the policy.\n\n203\n00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.700\nEven if it just means picking the default,\nbut\n\n204\n00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.450\nlook at the default,\nthe default contains no rules.\n\n205\n00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.060\nSo that means it's not\nreally going to do anything.\n\n206\n00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.220\nSo instead of doing that,\n\n207\n00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.960\nI'm going to choose the standard\nsystem security profile.\n\n208\n00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.270\nSo it'll apply that.\n\n209\n00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.420\nAnd I'll just hit, select that profile.\n\n210\n00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.600\nThat's a Red Hat thing.\n\n211\n00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.170\nYou'll see it under CentOS also.\n\n212\n00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.330\nAnd you'll see it under Fedora.\n\n213\n00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.480\nNot so much under other distributions\nthat don't use SE Linux.\n\n214\n00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.400\n&gt;&gt; Don, help me out here.\n\n215\n00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.480\nWith the defaults, does that mean\neverything is blocked by default, or\n\n216\n00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.380\neverything is allowed?\n\n217\n00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.900\nSay we didn't do anything here.\n\n218\n00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.580\nWe didn't initiate your\nstandard policy there.\n\n219\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.900\nWould that be everything would be\nblocked or everything would be allowed?\n\n220\n00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:05.650\n&gt;&gt; Neither.\n&gt;&gt; Neither?\n\n221\n00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:10.390\n&gt;&gt; So it actually, it means there is\na set of rules that Red Hat has chosen,\n\n222\n00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.990\nthat they feel are appropriate.\n\n223\n00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.910\nWhere pretty much all the traffic\ngoing out is allowed and\n\n224\n00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.530\ncoming in certain things are allowed and\ncertain things are blocked.\n\n225\n00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.370\nSo for example,\nSSH is allowed to come in by default.\n\n226\n00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.130\nSo it's not a all or\nnothing, its an in between.\n\n227\n00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.140\nWe're defaulting to what Red Hat says.\n\n228\n00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.370\nIf you're deploying 100 servers and\nyou have specific needs for\n\n229\n00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.590\nthem, you can create your own policies and\nprofiles and deploy that.\n\n230\n00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.940\nThat is a common thing when you're\ndeploying large quantities of servers.\n\n231\n00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:39.450\nAnd that's what a lot of this stuff is.\n\n232\n00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.520\nA lot of what we're looking at\nhere are things that Red Hat\n\n233\n00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.980\ndecided would be good defaults, or\nMicrosoft decided would be good defaults.\n\n234\n00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.095\nYou can always override them.\n\n235\n00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.670\nAll right,\nit's asking about my installation source.\n\n236\n00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.830\nMy install source is the CD that I\npopped in the drive to install, or\n\n237\n00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:54.960\nUSB key, or whatever.\n\n238\n00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.410\nSo it just says local media.\n\n239\n00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.560\nBut you could install over the network,\nright?\n\n240\n00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.510\nWell, you know,\nlet me talk about that a little bit here.\n\n241\n00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.880\nWhen we're installing\none server like this.\n\n242\n00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.190\nOr if we were even doing four or\nfive servers.\n\n243\n00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.030\nYou might have installation\nmedia that's on a USB key.\n\n244\n00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.820\nOr installation media that's on a CD.\n\n245\n00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.510\nOr for the virtual machines, it might\nbe an ISO image that's mounted, right?\n\n246\n00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.580\nAnd you run through an installer\njust I'm like doing right here.\n\n247\n00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.990\nEasy enough.\n\n248\n00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.700\nBut what if I had 1,000 servers\nthat I needed to spin up?\n\n249\n00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.090\nWell, I probably don't have\n1,000 CDs laying around.\n\n250\n00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.340\nI definitely don't have 1,000\nUSB keys laying around.\n\n251\n00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:36.020\nAnd even if I did, the idea of powering\nup 1,000 servers and booting off of these\n\n252\n00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.020\nkeys and running through the install 1,000\ntimes would be an absolute nightmare.\n\n253\n00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.320\nIt would just take too long, right?\n\n254\n00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.420\nIf I was an hourly employee,\nthen that's okay.\n\n255\n00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.590\nOr a contractor, right?\n\n256\n00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:49.070\nBut as a full-time employee or a salary\nemployee, you wanna get the work done as\n\n257\n00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.690\nfast as possible and\nhave it done as accurately as possible.\n\n258\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:56.480\nSo short of hiring a bunch of interns and\ngetting in there and doing it by hand,\n\n259\n00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.640\nwe're gonna try and automate\nthe installation as much as possible.\n\n260\n00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:04.260\nAnd one of the best ways to do that,\nis to utilize network installations.\n\n261\n00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.111\nNetwork installations use\nthings like PXE boot.\n\n262\n00:12:07.111 --> 00:12:10.030\nPXE is P-X-E,\nthe pre-execution environment.\n\n263\n00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.600\nWe saw it a little bit in the last episode\nwhen I was booting that server up.\n\n264\n00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.220\nWe would see the network\ncard initialize and\n\n265\n00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.710\nit would look at the network for a moment.\n\n266\n00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.780\nIt was looking to see if there was\na network boot server out there.\n\n267\n00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:22.960\nInstead of booting an operating\nsystem from the hard drive,\n\n268\n00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.170\nwe can boot an operating\nsystem from the network.\n\n269\n00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:29.706\nAnd you can take installation media like\nthis, like Microsoft Windows, or Red Hat,\n\n270\n00:12:29.706 --> 00:12:30.840\nor whoever.\n\n271\n00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.770\nAnd you can store it on the network.\n\n272\n00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:38.340\nAnd when a server boots up using PXE,\nthe network adapter reaches out and\n\n273\n00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.100\ngets a DHCP address.\n\n274\n00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.340\nAnd it looks at the DHCP server and\nsays, is there a BootP server,\n\n275\n00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:45.830\na boot protocol server?\n\n276\n00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.990\nA BootP server is a server\nthat serves up PXE images.\n\n277\n00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.340\nSo I can find that server on\nthe network thanks to DHCP.\n\n278\n00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:57.430\nI can talk to the server and I can ask for\na copy of the operating system.\n\n279\n00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.380\nAnd it might be a full-blown\nOS that's already configured.\n\n280\n00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.680\nOr it might be installation\nmedia like this.\n\n281\n00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.020\nSo now I can power on a server,\nboot from the network, and\n\n282\n00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.680\nnot have to have a CD or a USB key.\n\n283\n00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.370\nNow, two big advantages to that.\n\n284\n00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.810\nAdvantage one, if I have 1,000\nservers I don't need 1,000 keys.\n\n285\n00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.240\nI can just boot them all of\nthe network and off we go.\n\n286\n00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.280\nAdvantage two, what if a new OS comes out?\n\n287\n00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.651\nI'm doing Red Hat 7.2.\n\n288\n00:13:21.651 --> 00:13:24.210\nWell I know for a fact 7.3 is out.\n\n289\n00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:25.630\nSo there's new installation media.\n\n290\n00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.200\nNow I might say, you know what, forget it.\n\n291\n00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.310\nI'm still gonna do 7.2 and\n\n292\n00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.788\njust once they're up I'll do an update and\nthey'll update to 7.3.\n\n293\n00:13:31.788 --> 00:13:33.149\nEasy enough.\n\n294\n00:13:33.149 --> 00:13:36.360\nWell do I want to take 1,000 servers and\nhave them all update?\n\n295\n00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.560\nNo, but if I have 1,000 USB keys,\n\n296\n00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.890\nI'm not gonna do an update\nof 1,000 USB keys either.\n\n297\n00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.700\nBut if its all coming from\na network source, I can go and\n\n298\n00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.830\nupdate the installation\nmedia at the network source.\n\n299\n00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.160\nIn one place.\n\n300\n00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.600\nAnd now all of my 1,000 servers\nwould get 7.3 instead of 7.2.\n\n301\n00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.980\nSo it makes it far easier to manage\nto have something like that.\n\n302\n00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.110\nAnd then we can take it even\na step further and create and\n\n303\n00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.160\nunattended installation file.\n\n304\n00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.400\nWindows has unattended files.\n\n305\n00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.080\nYou use a utility called Sysprep to make\nthem and you can generate these basically\n\n306\n00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.600\nXML files that answer all the questions\nthat we're seeing here on the screen.\n\n307\n00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.500\nSo instead of going through it and\nhaving to choose a language and\n\n308\n00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.110\na hard drive and all that,\nits already got the answers.\n\n309\n00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:20.420\nRed Hat has files called Kickstart, and\nyou can throw Kickstart files in there.\n\n310\n00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.380\nEvery distribution is\na little different but\n\n311\n00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.780\nthey've all got some kind of\nautomation that is out there.\n\n312\n00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.330\nWhere you can already\nhave everything answered.\n\n313\n00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.540\nSo now, you boot up the server.\n\n314\n00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.580\nIt goes out on the network.\n\n315\n00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:32.880\nIt finds the installation media.\n\n316\n00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.800\nIt has the answers, it answers everything,\ninstalls it, comes up.\n\n317\n00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:37.540\nAnd it's done.\n\n318\n00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.720\nAll you had to do was push\na power button and that's it.\n\n319\n00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.050\nAnd you can even automate that\nif you really wanna go crazy.\n\n320\n00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:46.780\nYou can have servers that are configured\nto automatically power on when plugged in.\n\n321\n00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:52.500\nAnd so now you can have what's called\na Zero Touch Install, a ZTI, right?\n\n322\n00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.340\nZTI is like the Holy Grail\nof server deployment.\n\n323\n00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.270\nIf I have 1,000 servers,\nI just need to turn 1,000 servers on.\n\n324\n00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.792\nEverything else gets configured,\nit fires up.\n\n325\n00:15:01.792 --> 00:15:03.070\nIf they're web servers,\n\n326\n00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:07.000\nthey could automatically join our\nserver clusters and that's it.\n\n327\n00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.510\nYou're done.\n\n328\n00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:08.230\nYou walk away.\n\n329\n00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.370\nAll done in a matter of time.\n\n330\n00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.640\nIt takes longer to get the servers out of\nthe box than it does to get them installed\n\n331\n00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.410\nand configured.\n\n332\n00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.500\nBut it takes a lot of work.\n\n333\n00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.560\nSo normally we see things like LTI or\n\n334\n00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.490\nlight touch installations\nthat get created.\n\n335\n00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:23.290\nWhere people automate certain aspects and\nnot others.\n\n336\n00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.510\nSo you kinda customize it and tweak it.\n\n337\n00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.720\nI don't do any of that if\nit's less than ten servers.\n\n338\n00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:33.290\nBecause the amount of time it takes\nto set up automation is usually\n\n339\n00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:36.770\nmore than the time it would have taken\nme to just do it by hand ten times.\n\n340\n00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.690\nBut if I have to do 50 servers, or 100,\n\n341\n00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:42.980\n400, 1,000, you're darn right I'm gonna\nautomate as much of that as I can.\n\n342\n00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.420\nBecause answering these\nquestions is not realistic.\n\n343\n00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.870\nBut you always can jump in here and\n\n344\n00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.280\nanswer the questions by hand,\ncustomize it exactly the way you need.\n\n345\n00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.400\nAnd none of this stuff is binding, we can\nalways change it after the fact, too,\n\n346\n00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.860\nif we decide our needs are different.\n\n347\n00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.990\nAll right, so\ngot a little side tracked there.\n\n348\n00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.254\nNot too bad, though,\ncuz that is on the exam objectives.\n\n349\n00:16:00.254 --> 00:16:04.066\nIn fact, the only thing I\nmissed there is imaging and\n\n350\n00:16:04.066 --> 00:16:07.108\nTFTP I mentioned the pixie environment.\n\n351\n00:16:07.108 --> 00:16:10.256\nThe Pixie server what would be\nserving up these boot images.\n\n352\n00:16:10.256 --> 00:16:13.151\nIt serves those images up\nusing a protocol called TFTP,\n\n353\n00:16:13.151 --> 00:16:15.950\nthe trivial file transfer protocol.\n\n354\n00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.070\nIt's just like FTP, except it's trivial.\n\n355\n00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.140\nAnd the trivial part means it\ndoesn't use usernames and passwords.\n\n356\n00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.990\nYou're just connecting to grab a file,\nand that's it.\n\n357\n00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.480\nIt doesn't support sub folders.\n\n358\n00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.320\nIt doesn't support authentication.\n\n359\n00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.060\nIt doesn't support resuming transfers.\n\n360\n00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.260\nIt's just straight up, here's the file.\n\n361\n00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.180\nGood luck.\n\n362\n00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.240\nAnd that's it, right?\n\n363\n00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.380\nAnd when you're just getting an operating\nsystem that's exactly what we need.\n\n364\n00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.290\nWe don't need a whole lot\nof advanced features here.\n\n365\n00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.780\nHey, just give me the OS and let me boot\nup and we'll figure things out from there.\n\n366\n00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.480\nBut I just need my files,\nso use TFPT for that.\n\n367\n00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.860\nAnd then I'm talking about\ninstallation media right here.\n\n368\n00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:55.370\nBut I mentioned that we could\ndeploy a full blown server,\n\n369\n00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.230\none that's already done.\n\n370\n00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:00.660\nWell you see a lot of people\ndo that with server images.\n\n371\n00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.380\nA server image is where we take a server,\n\n372\n00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.340\nwe get it configured exactly\nthe way that we want.\n\n373\n00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.480\nAnd then we use a utility to\ncreate an image of that machine.\n\n374\n00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.460\nAn image is just a bit for bit copy\nof the hard drives of that server.\n\n375\n00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.880\nI could use Microsoft's ImageX or,\ndifferent name now.\n\n376\n00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.874\nIs it DISM, D-I-S-M?\n\n377\n00:17:18.874 --> 00:17:19.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n378\n00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.427\n[CROSSTALK] Deployment Image Servicing and\nManagement.\n\n379\n00:17:21.427 --> 00:17:22.250\nMajor.\n\n380\n00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.720\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, can always count on you for\nthe acronyms.\n\n381\n00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.200\nSo Microsoft has DISM which is a utility\nthat allows you to clone a Windows server.\n\n382\n00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.990\nThere's a Chronos True Image.\n\n383\n00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.660\nThere is Symantec Ghost.\n\n384\n00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Ghost's still around.\n\n385\n00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:40.350\nGhost has been around for over 20\nyears and so they're well established.\n\n386\n00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:45.630\nAll these programs, Paragon, Drive Image,\nthey all do the same basic idea.\n\n387\n00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.960\nThey take a hard drive of a server\nthat's already configured,\n\n388\n00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.060\nand just copy it into a file.\n\n389\n00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.553\nAnd now we can take that file,\nwe can go to any other server.\n\n390\n00:17:52.553 --> 00:17:55.053\nAnd we can deploy that image and\nnow it's up and\n\n391\n00:17:55.053 --> 00:17:57.670\nrunning configured exactly the same.\n\n392\n00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:59.920\nThe big thing you have to\nworry about with imaging and\n\n393\n00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:05.470\ncloning, is that it is a true\nduplicate of the original server.\n\n394\n00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:09.090\nNow in the Linux world\nthat's not such a big deal\n\n395\n00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.070\nunless you've got static IPs assigned.\n\n396\n00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.190\nBecause then these machines\nare gonna come up with the same IP.\n\n397\n00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.060\nWell, they'll have different network\nadapters and Linux recognizes that so\n\n398\n00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.600\nthat's usually not even a problem there.\n\n399\n00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.860\nSo direct cloning Linux\nboxes not really a big deal.\n\n400\n00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.400\nBut in the Windows world every server\nhas a security identifier SID.\n\n401\n00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.450\nAnd that SID is how the server\nidentifies itself and\n\n402\n00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:33.810\nhow other people identify\nthat server on the network.\n\n403\n00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:38.290\nIf I do a true clone of a Microsoft\nserver we get duplicate SIDs and\n\n404\n00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:39.190\nthat causes a problem.\n\n405\n00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:40.840\nOne of the servers will not work.\n\n406\n00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.690\nSo if we're going to be cloning Microsoft\nservers you gotta go a step further.\n\n407\n00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.260\nAnd they have a utility called Syscraft.\n\n408\n00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.380\nI already mentioned it.\n\n409\n00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.570\nThat we use for part of automation.\n\n410\n00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.520\nAnd it let's you wipe out\nthe SID on the system.\n\n411\n00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.370\nAnd then when it boots up the first\ntime it'll generate a new SID.\n\n412\n00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.520\nSo if I deployed a thousand times\nthey all generate a new SID\n\n413\n00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.730\non a thousand different\nsecurity identifiers.\n\n414\n00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:04.360\nSo, there are concerns like that\nwhen it comes to duplicating stuff.\n\n415\n00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.380\nIt makes that installed\ngo a lot more smoothly,\n\n416\n00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.780\nbut at the end of the day there's stuff we\nneed to think about to get this in place.\n\n417\n00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.570\nAnd that why I always say,\nif I'm just doing couple of servers,\n\n418\n00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.400\nI'll do it by hand, it's faster.\n\n419\n00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:20.050\nBut it's gotta be a large quantity for\nme to really sit down and automate it.\n\n420\n00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:23.710\nAll right, so\ngetting back to our install here.\n\n421\n00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:27.270\nThe next couple of things I have to\nchoose are the installation destination.\n\n422\n00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.690\nWhere do I want to install to?\n\n423\n00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:31.220\nRight now I'm kind of skipping past this.\n\n424\n00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.520\nI did the install source over here,\nI've got my software selection.\n\n425\n00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.020\nSoftware selection is really important.\n\n426\n00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.980\nIn Microsoft Windows, they take\nthe standpoint of we're going to install\n\n427\n00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:45.600\nthe minimum and then you can add\nwhat you need after the install.\n\n428\n00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.110\nSo, when you install a Windows server,\n\n429\n00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:50.450\nyou don't get these choices\nduring the install.\n\n430\n00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.160\nIt's just gonna install the minimum base.\n\n431\n00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.470\nAnd when it's done,\nthen we add on what we want.\n\n432\n00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.700\nAnd I'll show you guys\nthat a little bit later.\n\n433\n00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.900\nOn the Linux side though,\nI can go either way.\n\n434\n00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.310\nI can do the minimal install.\n\n435\n00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:03.010\nSee how that's the default.\n\n436\n00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.870\nOr, right now at this prompt I can\ncustomize it and add in software,\n\n437\n00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.647\ninstead of doing it after the.\n\n438\n00:20:08.647 --> 00:20:11.950\nI can still do it after the fact too,\nyou just get all the options here.\n\n439\n00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:15.330\nBut if I choose that software selection,\nwhat I'm gonna see\n\n440\n00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.630\nis what my base environment is, and\nany add ons for that environment.\n\n441\n00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.880\nSo it's choosing for\nme to do a minimal install, right.\n\n442\n00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.210\nBasic functionality, but\nwhat is basic functionality?\n\n443\n00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.240\nDepends on the vendor,\nwhat they've defined as basic.\n\n444\n00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.140\nBut it's usually a shell.\n\n445\n00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:37.030\nUser authentication typically is\nnot a graphical user interface.\n\n446\n00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.920\nBut there is a networking sub-layer.\n\n447\n00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.880\nMaybe there's some core\nutilities like Sendmail, for\n\n448\n00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.580\nbeing able to send notifications.\n\n449\n00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.690\nYou might have some things like that,\nbut typically is a very,\n\n450\n00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.320\nvery small installation.\n\n451\n00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.720\nUsually it's only a couple of hundred\nmegabytes in size, 200 or 300 megabytes.\n\n452\n00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.600\nThere's just not a lot to it.\n\n453\n00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.820\nBut if I'm gonna be setting up a web\nserver then I need a little more.\n\n454\n00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.800\nAnd so we've got Basic Web Server,\nI can choose that.\n\n455\n00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.840\nThat's gonna do basically like\nthe minimal but it's gonna add Apache for\n\n456\n00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.670\nmy web server.\n\n457\n00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.620\nAnd maybe NGINX or\na few other different utilities that\n\n458\n00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.630\nare all a part of serving up a web\npage it's gonna bring those in.\n\n459\n00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:18.620\nOr if I choose a Virtualization Host,\nnow it's gonna add in things like KVM,\n\n460\n00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:23.870\nor QEMU, or whatever it is that this\nsystem uses, so it's adding features.\n\n461\n00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.800\nNow the thing to remember\nabout deploying servers\n\n462\n00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.198\nis that we always want to\nminimize our attack surface.\n\n463\n00:21:30.198 --> 00:21:33.040\nThe more software you\nhave installed the more\n\n464\n00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.670\narea that somebody could attack\nyour server using, right?\n\n465\n00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.360\nSo let's say that I install a server.\n\n466\n00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.970\nNow I want it to be a web server.\n\n467\n00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:43.030\nAnd when I do that,\nif it is Microsoft, right?\n\n468\n00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.410\nMicrosoft Windows the IIS server\nincludes not just a web server but\n\n469\n00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.780\nan FTP server also, it's got both.\n\n470\n00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.840\nI don't wanna use FTP though I'm\njust gonna use the web server.\n\n471\n00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.380\nWell, when it gets up and running, you're\nrunning both, whether you want it or not.\n\n472\n00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.320\nAnd if you don't know\nabout that FTP server,\n\n473\n00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.360\nsomebody could be attacking\nthe FTP service on your server.\n\n474\n00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.310\nAnd you don't even know it, cuz you're\njust paying attention to the web server.\n\n475\n00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:08.310\nSo we need to be choosy,\nbe picky about it, right?\n\n476\n00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.950\nGo in and\npick just the individual items we want.\n\n477\n00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.850\nAnd say, look I don't need an FTP service.\n\n478\n00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:13.790\nI'm gonna turn that off.\n\n479\n00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:15.510\nOr I'm not even gonna install it.\n\n480\n00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.710\nAnd now we just get\nthe pieces that we want, so\n\n481\n00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.280\nthat's what they're asking for here.\n\n482\n00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:23.620\n&gt;&gt; Don when it comes to acquiring your\nISOs I know in the past you've told me and\n\n483\n00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.560\nsome of the other people here that\nwhen you're acquired a lot of times\n\n484\n00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.220\nyou'll do a minimal install.\n\n485\n00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.320\nSometimes if you're running\nthe Ubuntu desktop,\n\n486\n00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.570\nthat thing I think their ISOs\nup over five gigs by now.\n\n487\n00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:39.260\nWhich one would you choose, and in context\nwould you choose a minimal install ISO and\n\n488\n00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.190\nthen add or is it gonna be one of\nthese ones that it really depends\n\n489\n00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:43.780\non the environment that you're setting up?\n\n490\n00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.200\n&gt;&gt; It does depend on the environment.\n\n491\n00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.760\nIf it's a production server I\nalmost always do a minimal install.\n\n492\n00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.460\nBecause with a minimal install,\nI know that's the bare minimum.\n\n493\n00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:56.940\nI can't do less than the minimal install,\nand then I add the packages I need.\n\n494\n00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.420\nNow the reason I do that.\n\n495\n00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.480\nLet's say I'm deploying a web server.\n\n496\n00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.465\nWell I've got right here,\nBasic Web Server.\n\n497\n00:23:02.465 --> 00:23:05.845\nI can just choose that, so\nwhy would I still choose the minimal?\n\n498\n00:23:05.845 --> 00:23:08.445\nWell, Basic Web Server includes\nsome additional things.\n\n499\n00:23:08.445 --> 00:23:12.045\nSee how it says Server for serving\nstatic and dynamic Internet content?\n\n500\n00:23:12.045 --> 00:23:15.291\nSo that means it's gonna have\nthe PHP libraries loaded.\n\n501\n00:23:15.291 --> 00:23:16.735\nMaybe I'm not gonna use those.\n\n502\n00:23:16.735 --> 00:23:18.275\nOr CGI, right?\n\n503\n00:23:19.405 --> 00:23:21.655\nThe common gateway interface,\n\n504\n00:23:21.655 --> 00:23:24.310\nwhich is a scripting language\nthat can be used on web servers.\n\n505\n00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:25.520\nMaybe we're not gonna use that.\n\n506\n00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.600\nSo I don't wanna install those.\n\n507\n00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.310\nIt's what they view as a basic web server,\nbut\n\n508\n00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:32.110\nit might not be what I view\nas a basic web server.\n\n509\n00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:35.130\nSo by choosing minimal you can't go wrong,\nright?\n\n510\n00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.030\nBut if I want a GUI,\n\n511\n00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:41.570\nif I want a graphical user interface,\nit takes so much to support that.\n\n512\n00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:45.680\nThere's so much additional software\nrequired to support a GUI.\n\n513\n00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.150\nThat it really starts to grow.\n\n514\n00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:52.730\nAnd I'll tell you, Ubuntu,\nUbuntu's a very stable Linux distribution.\n\n515\n00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:56.853\nIt is commercially supported by Canonical,\nso it's a great operating system.\n\n516\n00:23:56.853 --> 00:24:00.913\nBut on their work station, and\neven their default server installs,\n\n517\n00:24:00.913 --> 00:24:05.617\nthey've focused on ease of use and a part\nof that is a graphical user interface.\n\n518\n00:24:05.617 --> 00:24:07.793\nAnd they've kinda bloated it.\n\n519\n00:24:07.793 --> 00:24:10.420\nThey've thrown in a bunch\nof extra software.\n\n520\n00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:13.190\nWell, they've done that for\nthe default install.\n\n521\n00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:16.713\nBut if you take an Ubuntu Server disk and\npop it in and choose the normal or\n\n522\n00:24:16.713 --> 00:24:18.840\nminimal installs, you won't have a GUI.\n\n523\n00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.159\nIt actually will be minimal, and\nit'll be a great server for you, right.\n\n524\n00:24:22.159 --> 00:24:24.070\nVersus Red Hat,\nwhere on their server side,\n\n525\n00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.940\nthey've already kind of paired that down.\n\n526\n00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.350\nIt's just different vendors have\ntaken different approaches on it.\n\n527\n00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.854\nBut if you want a graphical user\ninterface, you will end up with a larger\n\n528\n00:24:30.854 --> 00:24:33.580\ninstall just because of the extra\nsoftware that's needed.\n\n529\n00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.854\n&gt;&gt; So that, Don, almost takes us back to\nthe first part of this four part series\n\n530\n00:24:36.854 --> 00:24:39.721\nthat we're running here,\nwhere you talked about preparation and\n\n531\n00:24:39.721 --> 00:24:42.250\nknowing the role that\nthe servers are gonna play.\n\n532\n00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:45.480\nAll seems like that takes\npart in what kind of ISO and\n\n533\n00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.930\nwhat kind of installation you're gonna do?\n\n534\n00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:47.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n535\n00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:51.440\nAnd, hey, maybe I'm gonna be installing\na role that's not here on the list, right.\n\n536\n00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.850\nMaybe I want to do a database server.\n\n537\n00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:57.180\nWell, if I look at this list, I've got\nminimal, infrastructure, file and print,\n\n538\n00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.130\nbasic web, virtualization,\nserver with GUI.\n\n539\n00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:01.120\nDatabase isn't in the list.\n\n540\n00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.260\nWell, actually,\ndatabase might be under infrastructure.\n\n541\n00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.830\nAnd, no, no, nope, looking under\ninfrastructure, I don't see data.\n\n542\n00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:10.691\nI've got backup, DNS,\ndirectory client email.\n\n543\n00:25:10.691 --> 00:25:12.516\nSo we've got some options in here.\n\n544\n00:25:12.516 --> 00:25:16.010\nBut, well,\nthere's there is PostgreSQL, MariaDB.\n\n545\n00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:21.160\nAll right, so we can do a database server\nhere, if I wanna do MariaDb, right.\n\n546\n00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.298\nBut I chose infrastructure server,\nI'm picking my infrastructure,\n\n547\n00:25:24.298 --> 00:25:26.505\nwhat if the database I want\nis not in here, right?\n\n548\n00:25:26.505 --> 00:25:29.625\nThis is MariaDB,\nwhat if I want MySQL, right?\n\n549\n00:25:29.625 --> 00:25:32.290\nMost people have switched to Maria\nat this point, but I want it.\n\n550\n00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:34.020\nWell, it's not on the list.\n\n551\n00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:38.450\nSo, again, you choose minimal, and then\nyou add on and get just what you want.\n\n552\n00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:41.492\nSo just keep in mind what you pick here\ndoes influence the amount of software\n\n553\n00:25:41.492 --> 00:25:42.377\nthat's installed.\n\n554\n00:25:42.377 --> 00:25:45.629\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ndo a server with GUI on this one,\n\n555\n00:25:45.629 --> 00:25:49.604\nwhich is effectively gonna do\na basic server, a minimal install.\n\n556\n00:25:49.604 --> 00:25:53.020\nBut it's gonna at the GUI just to\ngive us that environment on it.\n\n557\n00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.370\nI'm gonna do it here cuz I know my\nnetwork adapter's not loaded light.\n\n558\n00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:57.640\nI guess I could do a minimal on this one,\nit wouldn't really matter.\n\n559\n00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:59.460\nAnd we'll go that route.\n\n560\n00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.006\nNow, even when I choose minimal,\nsee how I can add on things?\n\n561\n00:26:02.006 --> 00:26:05.860\nI can add debugging tools and\ncompatibility libraries and stuff.\n\n562\n00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.280\nThese are things that I may need for\nwhat I'm doing.\n\n563\n00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.813\nIf it's a development server,\nI might need those debugging tools.\n\n564\n00:26:10.813 --> 00:26:14.390\nIf it's a production server, I definitely\ndon't need those debugging tools.\n\n565\n00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.060\nSo you're gonna pick and\nchoose based on what that is.\n\n566\n00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:20.122\nWe've got additional security tools or\nsmart card support.\n\n567\n00:26:20.122 --> 00:26:22.474\nWe just pick and\nchoose what it is we want.\n\n568\n00:26:24.266 --> 00:26:28.112\nAll right, then we get down\nhere to our system, right.\n\n569\n00:26:28.112 --> 00:26:29.663\nWhere am I gonna install to?\n\n570\n00:26:29.663 --> 00:26:32.560\nI need to pick my\ninstallation destination.\n\n571\n00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:36.380\nNow, it says automatic\npartitioning selected.\n\n572\n00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:37.300\nThis is kinda like Windows.\n\n573\n00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.820\nWindows does the same thing,\nautomatic partitioning selected.\n\n574\n00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:45.150\nIt's gonna take our hard drive, and it's\ngonna lay it out the way that it sees fit.\n\n575\n00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:46.630\nYou might be fine with that.\n\n576\n00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.940\nBut you might have specific needs,\nand you can jump in and\n\n577\n00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.950\ncustomize that by choosing to go in and\nmodify it, all right.\n\n578\n00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:54.410\nSo I'm installing it here.\n\n579\n00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:57.700\nI'm on a virtual machine, so\nit shows as VMware virtual drive,\n\n580\n00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.068\nright, and it's a 20 gig drive.\n\n581\n00:27:00.068 --> 00:27:05.050\nAnd it's identified that as SDA,\nthat's the first drive in my system.\n\n582\n00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:08.600\nAnd it's gonna partition\nit out how it sees fit.\n\n583\n00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.980\nBut we don't have to do it that way.\n\n584\n00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:14.680\nI can come in here and\nI can partition it however I want.\n\n585\n00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.600\nI've got this little link down here that\nsays full disk summary and boot loader.\n\n586\n00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.950\nAnd we can click on that, and\nwe can see what's the boot device,\n\n587\n00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:22.680\nif I have more than one.\n\n588\n00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.720\nWe can choose whether we're gonna\ninstall the boot loader on there, right,\n\n589\n00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.840\ncuz when your system boots it's\ngotta be able to boot from a drive.\n\n590\n00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:33.320\nUEFI will have to be able to find it,\nif you've got UEFI.\n\n591\n00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.216\nAnd then anything else that we wanted\nto do down here as far as setting our\n\n592\n00:27:36.216 --> 00:27:37.147\npartitions and so on.\n\n593\n00:27:37.147 --> 00:27:39.301\nAnd if I had more than one drive,\nI could check it up here.\n\n594\n00:27:39.301 --> 00:27:42.610\nI've only got the one so\nit's not giving me a ton of options.\n\n595\n00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:46.963\nAnd if I keep scrolling down,\nthere were some hidden options down here.\n\n596\n00:27:46.963 --> 00:27:51.497\nAutomatically configure partitioning or\nI will configure it, okay.\n\n597\n00:27:51.497 --> 00:27:54.230\nNow, when I tell it that\nI'm gonna configure it,\n\n598\n00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:58.591\nnow it's gonna give me another screen in\njust a moment that'll let me pick all my\n\n599\n00:27:58.591 --> 00:28:00.830\npartitions that I can set up.\n\n600\n00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:04.000\nBut I can also enable encryption.\n\n601\n00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.080\nA lot of systems are enabling encryption\nnow, and there's a few reasons for\n\n602\n00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:08.950\nit, right.\n\n603\n00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:12.340\nUsually, we're really concerned about\nhard drive encryption with a laptop.\n\n604\n00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.468\nIf somebody steals my laptop,\nthey could take the hard drive out,\n\n605\n00:28:15.468 --> 00:28:18.828\nadd it as a second drive to their\ncomputer and read all my data.\n\n606\n00:28:18.828 --> 00:28:21.560\nThey don't even have to log in,\nthey can just read my data.\n\n607\n00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.635\nBut if my drive is encrypted, they could\nrip the hard drive out and hook it up, and\n\n608\n00:28:24.635 --> 00:28:26.871\nthey're just gonna see encrypted data,\nand that's it.\n\n609\n00:28:26.871 --> 00:28:28.967\nThey would have to have my username and\npassword, and\n\n610\n00:28:28.967 --> 00:28:31.631\nthey would have to boot off of that\ndrive to be able to get at the data.\n\n611\n00:28:31.631 --> 00:28:34.120\nThey're not gonna have that\ninformation unprotected.\n\n612\n00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.190\nWe worry about it with\nlaptops cuz they're portable.\n\n613\n00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.590\nWe take them places,\nthey're easy to get stolen.\n\n614\n00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:39.880\nBut a server?\n\n615\n00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.040\nA server's locked in your server closet,\nisn't it?\n\n616\n00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.460\nSo if it's locked behind a wall\nwith a keypadded door or\n\n617\n00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.980\nbiometrics or whatever,\nwhy would we encrypt the drive?\n\n618\n00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.670\nIt's gonna hurt performance a little bit.\n\n619\n00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:57.210\nWell, you're not always deploying\na server in your own server closet.\n\n620\n00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:58.600\nMaybe you work for a school board,\n\n621\n00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.940\nand you've got a centralized data\ncenter right there at that home office.\n\n622\n00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.810\nBut then you've got 100 schools\nout there with servers at each.\n\n623\n00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:09.160\nAnd you don't know who has access to\nthose rooms and what kids might try and\n\n624\n00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.860\nget in there, or if somebody could\ngain access to those drives.\n\n625\n00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.190\nYou might choose to encrypt them.\n\n626\n00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:15.960\nOr if you've got a co-location facility,\nright,\n\n627\n00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.700\nwhere you're renting\na data center somewhere.\n\n628\n00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.870\nYou don't know what employees at that\ndata center have access to the equipment.\n\n629\n00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.930\nYou might choose to encrypt\nyour drives there, too.\n\n630\n00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.800\n&gt;&gt; Don, would you practice doing\nthe encryption if you were spinning one\n\n631\n00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.660\nof these up, say in AWS?\n\n632\n00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.240\nOr if you were in Azure,\nwould you be doing the same thing and\n\n633\n00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.752\nencrypting the drive there?\n\n634\n00:29:31.752 --> 00:29:32.882\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n635\n00:29:32.882 --> 00:29:37.160\nand a lot of those guys support doing\nencryption just when you deploy.\n\n636\n00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.320\nI don't even trust that, though.\n\n637\n00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.490\nBecause now you're saying,\nyou're gonna encrypt it for me,\n\n638\n00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:43.040\nbut you don't know the private key?\n\n639\n00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.320\nI have a hard time swallowing that.\n\n640\n00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:50.070\nSo you can still do your own encryption\nwhen you deploy in a cloud environment,\n\n641\n00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:51.840\nand it's the same thing.\n\n642\n00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.810\nYou don't know who all\nworks in that data center.\n\n643\n00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:57.160\nYou don't even really know where\nthe data center is, in the case of AWS.\n\n644\n00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.470\nSo you don't know a lot of that stuff,\n\n645\n00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:02.978\nand you just can't necessarily\nput it up for trusting.\n\n646\n00:30:02.978 --> 00:30:04.197\nYou might not have the option.\n\n647\n00:30:04.197 --> 00:30:05.620\nMaybe you have medical records.\n\n648\n00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:07.390\nAnd here in the US,\nwe have HIPAA compliance,\n\n649\n00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:11.100\nwhere you have to have those medical\nrecords stored on an encrypted medium.\n\n650\n00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.530\nYou don't have a choice,\nit's got to be done.\n\n651\n00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:16.035\nSo you've got that option to turn it on.\n\n652\n00:30:16.035 --> 00:30:20.870\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm gonna say that I'm\ngoing to configure my own partitioning.\n\n653\n00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:23.500\nAnd when I hit Done,\nit's gonna take me to another screen.\n\n654\n00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.960\nAnd here I get to set\nup that partitioning.\n\n655\n00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.290\nNow, depending on your operating system,\n\n656\n00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:32.710\nsome of them just do standard\npartitioning and that's it.\n\n657\n00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:34.416\nOther have more advanced things.\n\n658\n00:30:34.416 --> 00:30:38.210\nHere in Red Hat, we've got LVM,\nthe logical volume manager.\n\n659\n00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:42.010\nAnd the logical volume manager lets\nus do things like software RAID and\n\n660\n00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:42.620\nstuff like that.\n\n661\n00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:43.300\nWell, you know what?\n\n662\n00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.881\nI've got a hardware RAID\ncontroller in this server.\n\n663\n00:30:45.881 --> 00:30:47.413\nI don't need software RAID.\n\n664\n00:30:47.413 --> 00:30:51.486\nI don't need expanding drives the way\nthat LVM does it because I've got a RAID\n\n665\n00:30:51.486 --> 00:30:54.780\ncontroller that's already\ntaken care of that for me.\n\n666\n00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.530\nSo if you're not gonna use it,\nyou don't have to use it.\n\n667\n00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:01.524\nYou can come through and tell it that\nyou're gonna do standard partitioning,\n\n668\n00:31:01.524 --> 00:31:02.137\nlike that.\n\n669\n00:31:02.137 --> 00:31:04.783\nAnd now you can come through and\ncreate partitions the regular,\n\n670\n00:31:04.783 --> 00:31:07.240\nold way because you've got\na RAID controller handling it.\n\n671\n00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.870\nBut if you don't have a RAID controller,\nif you've just got a couple of drives and\n\n672\n00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.041\nthey're JBODs, right,\njust a bunch of disks?\n\n673\n00:31:13.041 --> 00:31:16.523\nThen we can go in and we can start to\napply our customizations there, and\n\n674\n00:31:16.523 --> 00:31:19.543\nuse the software RAIDS, or\nsoftware mirroring, striping,\n\n675\n00:31:19.543 --> 00:31:23.333\nwhatever does what we want, and\ntry to achieve decent performance, right.\n\n676\n00:31:23.333 --> 00:31:26.332\nAnytime you do software drive operations,\nyou're not gonna get the same performance\n\n677\n00:31:26.332 --> 00:31:28.029\nas you would with\nthe hardware RAID controller.\n\n678\n00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.000\nAll right, but from here,\nI can start to add my partitions.\n\n679\n00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.940\nAnd when you add a partition in Linux,\nyou have to specify a mount point.\n\n680\n00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.730\nAnd if you look, I've got, what have we\ngot, six different things listed here?\n\n681\n00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.160\nEach one of these kind of\nserves a different role, right.\n\n682\n00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.157\nWe've got a slash,\nthat's the root partition.\n\n683\n00:31:45.157 --> 00:31:47.672\nThat's the one partition we have to have.\n\n684\n00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:50.050\nThe others are all optional,\nthis one we have to have.\n\n685\n00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:54.194\nThis is where all our stuff's gonna go,\nwell, most of our stuff.\n\n686\n00:31:54.194 --> 00:31:57.493\nIf I only create this partition then,\nyes, all of our stuff will go there.\n\n687\n00:31:57.493 --> 00:32:03.184\nBut usually we'll create separation\npartitions for boot Home and var okay?\n\n688\n00:32:03.184 --> 00:32:05.330\nBoot that's where our boot files go.\n\n689\n00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:10.380\nOur Linux kernel, our boot loader if we're\nrunning Grub or other software like that.\n\n690\n00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.660\nThey'll go right there\nin that boot folder.\n\n691\n00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.970\nAnd these are things that\nshouldn't be messed with.\n\n692\n00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:16.790\nThey put them in a separate folder,\nput them in a separate partition.\n\n693\n00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:21.210\nThe other reason for separating it out,\nis if I have an EFI system,\n\n694\n00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:24.900\nUEFI needs to be able to find this and\nread from it to boot my system.\n\n695\n00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:29.180\nAnd it's gonna expect it to be\na standard file system that we can read.\n\n696\n00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.930\nAnd it's gonna expect\nit to be unencrypted.\n\n697\n00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:33.970\nIf it's encrypted,\nhow are we gonna boot it, right?\n\n698\n00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:36.440\nAnd if we can't boot it,\nhow are we supposed to decrypt?\n\n699\n00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.500\nSo you, you're kind of in a catch there.\n\n700\n00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.920\nSo this will be unencrypted,\nwhere everything else can be encrypted.\n\n701\n00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.550\nSo there's a few different reasons for\nseparating out boot.\n\n702\n00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:45.480\nSlash home.\n\n703\n00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.030\nThat's where your user files go.\n\n704\n00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:48.910\nRight?\nOur home directories.\n\n705\n00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:53.530\nI don't want Wes to be able to fill up my\nhard drive and make the server freeze.\n\n706\n00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:55.790\nBut if I have the home directories\nmoved to a separate partition,\n\n707\n00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:57.750\nhe could fill up that partition.\n\n708\n00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:00.330\nBut then the other stuff\nwill still be fine, right?\n\n709\n00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:03.600\nAnd the one I'm most\nconcerned about is var, /var.\n\n710\n00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.250\nThat's where our various files go.\n\n711\n00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.670\nAll the runtime files,\nwhen you start a webserver and so\n\n712\n00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:09.660\non there are temporary files.\n\n713\n00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.620\nThey all get created in there.\n\n714\n00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.140\nThe web pages they serve up are normally\nserved up from out of there.\n\n715\n00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:17.230\nAnd if that gets full and\nI've got a database server,\n\n716\n00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:20.010\nnow I can't add records to the database\nanymore cuz the hard drive's full, right.\n\n717\n00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:21.400\nSo we might choose to separate that out.\n\n718\n00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:26.140\nSwap used to be really important, right.\n\n719\n00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.300\nYou only have so much RAM in your server.\n\n720\n00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.830\nLet's say I had eight gigs of RAM and if\nI start running software like a database\n\n721\n00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.640\nserver and it needs more than\neight gigs of RAM, what happens?\n\n722\n00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:39.120\nIt runs slow or it stops, freezes.\n\n723\n00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.350\nWe can use swap to say hey, you know what,\nwe're gonna take things in memory that\n\n724\n00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:45.230\naren't being used very frequently and\nmove them to the hard drive.\n\n725\n00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:48.610\nAnd by moving them to the hard\ndrive we can separate them out.\n\n726\n00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:50.420\nAnd now it's slower,\nit's on the hard drive, but\n\n727\n00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.460\nit looks like we have a lot more memory.\n\n728\n00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.960\nWell, memory isn't that expensive anymore.\n\n729\n00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:59.600\nAnd so it's easy to get 64 gigs of RAM in\na server and get these higher levels, so\n\n730\n00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.600\na lot of people aren't using\nswap like they used to.\n\n731\n00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.930\nAlthough if you've got SSDs swap can\nactually be very fast on an SSD.\n\n732\n00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.210\nAlthough the intense read and\n\n733\n00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.810\nwrites that happen usually\nshorten the lifetime of that SSD.\n\n734\n00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.970\nBut swap is less important today\nbecause we have so much memory.\n\n735\n00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:17.250\nOn workstations,\nswap is not normally used at all.\n\n736\n00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:19.980\nBut on database servers, it does get used.\n\n737\n00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:22.920\nAnd we might want to have special\ndrives set up just for it.\n\n738\n00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.810\nMaybe I've got a RAID One mirror for\nmy swap.\n\n739\n00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:31.530\nAnd I've got a RAID Five Stripe set up for\nmy home or VAR.\n\n740\n00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:35.140\nI can different RAID containers set up for\neach of these by partitioning them out.\n\n741\n00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:40.040\nAnd then lastly we've got BiosBoot,\nthat's another extension of UEFI, right,\n\n742\n00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:44.310\nif it needs that partition to find, to be\nable to store the EFI files to be able to\n\n743\n00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:45.580\nboot from, we can separate that out.\n\n744\n00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.080\nWe don't normally do that.\n\n745\n00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:52.440\nNow, just choosing the mount\npoint isn't enough,\n\n746\n00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.470\nit's gotta get formatted,\nit has to have a file system put on it.\n\n747\n00:34:55.470 --> 00:35:01.590\nSo if I create a 16 gig\nroot partition right here.\n\n748\n00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:05.240\nIt's now got that root partition defined,\nand it's asking for\n\n749\n00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.850\nme to pick a device type and\na file system.\n\n750\n00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:13.120\nThe device type is just whether\nit's gonna be LVM or standard.\n\n751\n00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.850\nBTFS is not on the exam but\n\n752\n00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:19.720\nthat's a new one that is coming\nout called a b tree file system.\n\n753\n00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.540\nI shouldn't say it's new cuz it's\nbeen out for over ten years, but\n\n754\n00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.600\nit's only now being accepted by Red Hat\nand a few of the other commercial vendors.\n\n755\n00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.330\nUbuntu's already switched over to it,\nI believe.\n\n756\n00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.760\nBut if I stick with standard,\nI can choose to encrypt it and\n\n757\n00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.390\nI can choose a file system.\n\n758\n00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:37.090\nNow choosing your file system is\nimportant cuz you wanna make sure\n\n759\n00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:39.080\nyou choose one that\nmeets all of your needs.\n\n760\n00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.480\nAnd so I wanna talk a bit\nabout each of these, and\n\n761\n00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.750\nwe've already talked a little\nbit about file systems.\n\n762\n00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:47.220\nBut I know I'm running low on time on this\none, so I think we're probably gonna have\n\n763\n00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.890\nto stop before we can kinda move\nforward on the rest of this.\n\n764\n00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:53.640\nBut you'll see that we got a lot of\nchoices and depending on your distribution\n\n765\n00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.710\nyou may have more than I do, or\nyou may have less than I do.\n\n766\n00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:58.680\nSo it's more of that\ndecision making process.\n\n767\n00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.130\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, we appreciate you showing us\n\n768\n00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:04.390\nthe first few steps of getting\na Linux server installed.\n\n769\n00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:05.760\nIt's definitely different from Windows.\n\n770\n00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.920\nYou got a few more options there,\nfor sure.\n\n771\n00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.470\nBut before we sign out,\n\n772\n00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:13.270\nDon, do you have any additional words\nthat you might like to throw in this one?\n\n773\n00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:14.830\nOn this, on the install side,\n\n774\n00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:17.600\nI can't stress how important it is\nto read the vendor documentation.\n\n775\n00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.390\nBecause every distro is\na little bit different.\n\n776\n00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:24.650\nMicrosoft Windows, Mac OS, Linux, whatever\nit is that you're running on your server\n\n777\n00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:26.580\nand inside of Linux,\nall the different distros,\n\n778\n00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:29.660\nthey all have different requirements and\ndifferent features and functionality.\n\n779\n00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.670\nSo just make sure you learn\nwhat your distro supports,\n\n780\n00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:33.200\nthat you're taking advantage of it.\n\n781\n00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.310\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, as always we appreciate\nyour expertise on this subject.\n\n782\n00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:38.320\nAnd we appreciate you,\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n783\n00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.330\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n784\n00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:41.990\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n785\n00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:43.547\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n786\n00:36:43.547 --> 00:36:50.634\n[MUSIC]\n\n787\n00:36:50.634 --> 00:36:52.850\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:12.318\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.318 --> 00:00:15.431\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:18.155\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:21.355\nwe're continuing through our\nseries in CompTIA Server+, and\n\n7\n00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:25.221\nwe're actually coming back with a part\nfour, because who needs trilogies?\n\n8\n00:00:25.221 --> 00:00:28.440\nThey're boring, and joining us for this\nendeavor is none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.540\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.092\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing swell.\n\n11\n00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:33.380\nWe're doing Hollywood, where you save the\nlast book, and split it into two movies,\n\n12\n00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.140\nso you get a little extra.\n\n13\n00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.680\nSo, that's what we're doing.\n\n14\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.110\nWe left off in the last episode where\nwe were picking a file system for\n\n15\n00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.740\nour installs.\n\n16\n00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.860\nThat's where we're gonna pick back up.\n\n17\n00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.520\nAnd Wes reminded me during the break that\nI actually already talked about the file\n\n18\n00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.850\nsystem back in part one and two,\nso we've seen those a little bit.\n\n19\n00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.640\nBut let me just kind of reiterate it.\n\n20\n00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.850\nAs you do your installation on Windows,\nyou don't worry about it,\n\n21\n00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.110\nbecause you really just do NTFS, but\n\n22\n00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.290\non a Linux box, when you format your\ndisks, you choose a file system.\n\n23\n00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.240\nAnd it's not the easiest thing in\nthe world to change a file system\n\n24\n00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.320\nafter the fact, so make sure you\nchoose the appropriate file system for\n\n25\n00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.010\nyour needs, right?\n\n26\n00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.910\nFor what it is you're doing.\n\n27\n00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.020\nIf you're setting up a database server and\nyou're gonna have some really large files,\n\n28\n00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.850\nthen there's certain file systems\nthat play nice with that, and\n\n29\n00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.190\ncertain ones that don't.\n\n30\n00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.300\nAnd then if you're gonna have\njust a bunch of smaller files,\n\n31\n00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.450\nmaybe you don't care so much.\n\n32\n00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.890\nOr maybe you need journaling, or whatever.\n\n33\n00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.990\nThe features you need are gonna\ndetermine which file system you use.\n\n34\n00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.290\nBut also, which distribution you\nrun is gonna influence that.\n\n35\n00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.470\nSo, looking at the Red Hat install\nthat we started in the last episode,\n\n36\n00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.980\nit's asked me to pick my file system.\n\n37\n00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.670\nSo I've got ext2, 3, and 4, which\ntechnically are the same file system,\n\n38\n00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.230\nbut with extra features added to each one.\n\n39\n00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.940\nSo, it's actually not hard to\nconvert between those at all.\n\n40\n00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.380\nWell, to go from 2 to 3, or 3 to 4, it's\nkind of hard to go from 4 down to 2, but\n\n41\n00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.950\nyou can move those.\n\n42\n00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.400\nWhen we choose xfs though, xfs is its\nown file system, it's very different.\n\n43\n00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.960\nAnd that's actually the default that\nRed Hat uses, they recommend that.\n\n44\n00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.357\nIf you want BTRFS,\nyou gotta go a slightly different router.\n\n45\n00:01:58.357 --> 00:02:01.987\nIf you want ZFS, right, ZFS is very\npopular because of its performance and\n\n46\n00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:05.676\nscalability, but because of the Oracle\nlicensing that's attached to it,\n\n47\n00:02:05.676 --> 00:02:07.650\nmost distributions don't support it.\n\n48\n00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.835\nSo, I don't even have\nZFS as an option here.\n\n49\n00:02:09.835 --> 00:02:11.138\nIf I were running Solaris,\n\n50\n00:02:11.138 --> 00:02:14.890\nit would be the default, so you basically\nhave those things and influence it.\n\n51\n00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.526\nAnd then vfat,\nthat's Microsoft's fat system that we use.\n\n52\n00:02:20.526 --> 00:02:24.496\nVfat's tied to xfat, so Microsoft\ncalls it xfat, and here it's vfat.\n\n53\n00:02:24.496 --> 00:02:26.288\nBut if we wanted to go that route for\ncompatibility,\n\n54\n00:02:26.288 --> 00:02:29.720\nyou probably wouldn't want to do that on\nyour Linux box, but you certainly could.\n\n55\n00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.640\nSo, you're gonna choose your file system,\nmake sure you choose appropriately here,\n\n56\n00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.360\nbecause it is hard to change later.\n\n57\n00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.130\nAll right, now, for me, I'm actually\njust gonna reset this, and I will\n\n58\n00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.830\nput it back to automatic,\nsince I'm not going to, shoot.\n\n59\n00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.480\nWell, never mind.\n\n60\n00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.680\nI'm not gonna go back to automatic,\nbecause it's gonna make me set it now.\n\n61\n00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.440\nSometimes they get a little forceful.\n\n62\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.780\nOnce you decided to go ahead and\noverride it, they're no,\n\n63\n00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.590\nno, you're gonna override it now.\n\n64\n00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.890\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead an mount these.\n\n65\n00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.010\nWhen I specify the disc and add them,\n\n66\n00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.998\nI really just need a root, and I'm gonna\ngo ahead and define the swap separately.\n\n67\n00:03:08.998 --> 00:03:10.330\nAnd I needed to define\nthe swap separately,\n\n68\n00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.560\nbecause the swap uses\na different file system.\n\n69\n00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.200\nIn Windows, swap is just a file\nright there in your hard drive.\n\n70\n00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.990\nYou have, what's it called?\n\n71\n00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.870\nIt's swapfile.sys?\n\n72\n00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.350\nDo you remember the swap\nfile name in Windows, Wes?\n\n73\n00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.400\n&gt;&gt; Gosh, yeah, page.\n\n74\n00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.590\nIt's pagefile.\n&gt;&gt; Pagefile.\n\n75\n00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.370\n&gt;&gt; Pagefile, yeah .sys.\n\n76\n00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.870\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\nSo,\n\n77\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.950\nit's just a file right there\non your regular drive.\n\n78\n00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.980\nBut in Linux, it's a separate partition.\n\n79\n00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.670\nSo, I'm gonna come in here and mount it.\n\n80\n00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.640\nAnd I'll put, maybe I just want 1G.\n\n81\n00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.811\nSwap partition or whatever, you would\nchoose the appropriate size for you, and\n\n82\n00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:43.752\nsee how I don't have to give it a path,\nslash something,\n\n83\n00:03:43.752 --> 00:03:47.217\nbecause it doesn't really have a path,\nit's its own partition.\n\n84\n00:03:47.217 --> 00:03:50.383\nSo, that's kind of the minimum for what\nI'm gonna need to get this system done, so\n\n85\n00:03:50.383 --> 00:03:52.340\nI'll go ahead and say done.\n\n86\n00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.490\nAnd oops, looks like I got\nsome kind of an error there.\n\n87\n00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.070\nWell, you know what?\n\n88\n00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.620\nWe're gonna force it.\n\n89\n00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.070\nIt's just warning me that we're\ngonna be destroying the format,\n\n90\n00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.990\nand then going through\nin creating all these.\n\n91\n00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.760\nI'll go and accept those changes.\n\n92\n00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.770\nAnd if I'm really worried, I'll make\na mistake on that, I could always go and\n\n93\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.170\nchange it and fix it however I need.\n\n94\n00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.150\nAll right, then we got network and\nhost name.\n\n95\n00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.750\nNow, network and host name is where we\nkinda start getting the things that\n\n96\n00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.300\nare post installation, right?\n\n97\n00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.940\nStuff we would do after the fact.\n\n98\n00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.750\nRemember, I tried to turn on my\ntime server in the last episode,\n\n99\n00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.300\nand my network wasn't running, so\nit wouldn't let me turn it on.\n\n100\n00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.530\nAnd sure enough, I can see that\nit found my network adapter,\n\n101\n00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.510\nand that network adapter is turned off.\n\n102\n00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.100\nNow, I can configure it after I boot, but\n\n103\n00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.040\nif I'm doing just a non GUI install.\n\n104\n00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.770\nIt's not the easiest thing to configure.\n\n105\n00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.380\nI gotta go edit a few files to\nget the network adapter set up.\n\n106\n00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.070\nSo, configuring the network adapter now\nwill save me some trouble later on,\n\n107\n00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.420\nbecause I can do it here with the GUI.\n\n108\n00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.210\nI can set IP Addresses.\n\n109\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.734\nAnd we can override that,\nand go static, or whatever,\n\n110\n00:04:52.734 --> 00:04:56.309\nif we need to,\nto get particular IPs set up.\n\n111\n00:04:56.309 --> 00:05:01.135\nWe can enable IPv6, whatever it is that\nwe need to do to get this up in place.\n\n112\n00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:03.840\n802.1x security if we're using that\non the network we can configure it\n\n113\n00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.440\nall right here.\n\n114\n00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.430\nYou can also set your host name, another\nthing that can be overwritten later.\n\n115\n00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.990\nBut if you know the host name of your\nserver, you can define it here, so\n\n116\n00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.400\nmaybe this is mailserv1.lab.itpro.tv,\nor whatever it happens to be.\n\n117\n00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.500\nYou can punch in that name to\nname the system ahead of time.\n\n118\n00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.960\nOn Windows, it just automatically\ngenerates a fake name, and\n\n119\n00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.120\nthen you can change it.\n\n120\n00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.963\nHere in Linux,\nit's local host is what they set it to.\n\n121\n00:05:30.106 --> 00:05:33.040\nAnd then lastly,\nthis one is a kernel dump, KDUMP.\n\n122\n00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.320\nAnd I can choose to enable KDUMP,\nor I can turn it off.\n\n123\n00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.410\nBasically, when your system crashes,\nif you ever have a segment fault or\n\n124\n00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.670\nsomething like that,\na system crashes and reboots,\n\n125\n00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.910\nit can take the kernel memory that was in\nplace at that time and dump it to a file.\n\n126\n00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.040\nIf you have a staff of developers or\ndebuggers, they can open that file and\n\n127\n00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.290\nlook and find out what was going on in\nthe system when the crash happened.\n\n128\n00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.575\nThat's pretty useful.\n\n129\n00:05:53.575 --> 00:05:58.670\nBut if I've got 1,000 web servers that are\nin some kind of lower balancing cluster,\n\n130\n00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.840\nI'll probably don't care\nif one of the sites fall,\n\n131\n00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.130\nI'll probably just throw it out and bring\nin a new one and then replace it, so,\n\n132\n00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.870\nwe might choose to turn that off.\n\n133\n00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.330\nIt does consume some hard drive space and\na little bit of CPU and memory to keep\n\n134\n00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.000\nthat service up and running,\nsome people kill it off for performance.\n\n135\n00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.570\nUsually I leave it on, just in case.\n\n136\n00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.270\nAnd once that's done, I can hit the all\nimportant Begin Installation button,\n\n137\n00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.130\nand it's gonna start the install.\n\n138\n00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.630\nAnd just like we saw on Windows, it's\ngonna turn through copying all the files\n\n139\n00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.690\nover, and getting all that stuff\nkinda done and taken care of.\n\n140\n00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.870\nAnd when I do it at the beginning,\nit's gonna go.\n\n141\n00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.870\nNow, during an install, normally we're\njust sitting here watching the bar\n\n142\n00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.580\nslowly crawl across the screen,\nbut Red Hat does something neat.\n\n143\n00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.230\nThey let us start to perform post\ninstallation tasks right now.\n\n144\n00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.040\nWhen a server is first installed,\n\n145\n00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.610\nthere's several steps that we\nwant to take to get it ready.\n\n146\n00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.250\nAnd they're the post-installation steps.\n\n147\n00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.010\nOne of them is we need\nto create a custom user.\n\n148\n00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.500\nIn Windows, you have a default\nuser called administrator.\n\n149\n00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.000\nIn Linux,\nyou have a default user called root.\n\n150\n00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.030\nWell, attackers know that.\n\n151\n00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.370\nIf somebody wants to\nhack into your system,\n\n152\n00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.420\nthey'll assume that you have a route or\nan administrator account.\n\n153\n00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.100\nSo, it makes sense that we should\ncreate our own account, and\n\n154\n00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.280\nnot allow remote access\nto the default account.\n\n155\n00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.290\nIn Windows, you can disable\nthe administrator account, so\n\n156\n00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.660\nit doesn't even work anymore.\n\n157\n00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.070\nIn Linux, you can take the root account\nand say yeah, it works locally, but\n\n158\n00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.000\nI won't allow remote connections to\nauthenticate its root, effectively making\n\n159\n00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.270\nan attacker have to be at the machine\nto exploit the root account.\n\n160\n00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.740\nWhich, if they're at the machine,\n\n161\n00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.400\nyou've got bigger problems\nthan your root account.\n\n162\n00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.020\nSo, we can start to do that right here.\n\n163\n00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.320\nWe can change the root password.\n\n164\n00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.320\nSo I'll come in and\n\n165\n00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.420\npunch in some ultra-secure password\nthat it's gonna tell me it's too weak.\n\n166\n00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.740\nI'm just doing the word password,\nwe're not going high security today.\n\n167\n00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.000\nBut I can come in and punch that,\nI can create a user account for\n\n168\n00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.430\nmyself if I want, so\nit's gonna let me create one.\n\n169\n00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.506\nI can make myself\nan administrator if I need to be.\n\n170\n00:07:50.506 --> 00:07:54.853\nWe can determine what our password will\nbe, and we can get that one set, and\n\n171\n00:07:54.853 --> 00:07:58.855\nso those steps that I would normally\ntake afterwards Are now done, so\n\n172\n00:07:58.855 --> 00:08:01.753\nit gives me a little something\nto do while I wait for\n\n173\n00:08:01.753 --> 00:08:04.830\nthis little bar to crawl\nacross the screen.\n\n174\n00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:10.730\nI chose a minimal install so it's just\ndoing 328 packages, and it's almost done.\n\n175\n00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.500\nIf I was doing a GUI install it's over\n2,000 packages that it has to install.\n\n176\n00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.317\nIt's a huge amount of software to\nsupport that graphical user interface.\n\n177\n00:08:18.317 --> 00:08:20.860\nThat's why servers don't\nnormally run in GUI.\n\n178\n00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:25.139\nIt's all about minimizing your footprint.\n\n179\n00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:28.335\nAll right, now when that's done, it's\ngonna boot up and my system's ready to go.\n\n180\n00:08:28.335 --> 00:08:31.520\nI've got a Red Hat system that is up and\nconfigured.\n\n181\n00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.400\nI might need to tweak it a little more but\nthe basic configuration is done.\n\n182\n00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.210\nI've mentioned Windows a few times and\n\n183\n00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.550\nwhen we did the Windows\ninstall two episodes ago.\n\n184\n00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.660\nIt didn't have any of these choices.\n\n185\n00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.860\nYou just hit next, and off it went.\n\n186\n00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.280\nAnd the reason was that it gives\nyou the choices after the install.\n\n187\n00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.070\nSo let me just show you an example\nwith that Windows server.\n\n188\n00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.750\nSo the last time we saw\nthe Windows server,\n\n189\n00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.600\nit was just kind of starting\nthe install and going.\n\n190\n00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.070\nWell, it finished.\n\n191\n00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.860\nAnd when it's done, it reboots.\n\n192\n00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.820\nIt boots into Windows server and\nit launches this screen right here,\n\n193\n00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.330\nthe server manager.\n\n194\n00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.430\nAnd the server manager starts walking\nus through some of the steps to get\n\n195\n00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.550\nthis server up and going.\n\n196\n00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:17.449\nNow if you click on the local server over\nhere, you'll get a summary of items and\n\n197\n00:09:17.449 --> 00:09:20.317\nyou'll be able to tweak and\nconfigure these.\n\n198\n00:09:20.317 --> 00:09:23.965\nAnd you should notice that most of\nthe things that we saw in the Red Hat\n\n199\n00:09:23.965 --> 00:09:25.840\ninstaller are right here.\n\n200\n00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.900\nI can set my computer name,\nI can configure my network interfaces and\n\n201\n00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.240\nget those set up.\n\n202\n00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.220\nI can configure remote management or\nthe firewall, and\n\n203\n00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.330\nI can go in and\nstart to do some other tasks.\n\n204\n00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.570\nI don't see things like\ncreate a user account.\n\n205\n00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:40.583\nIs not in here, right?\n\n206\n00:09:40.583 --> 00:09:43.380\nBut we can do that\nthrough a different menu.\n\n207\n00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.640\nSo these are some of the things that\nI need to do to get a server up and\n\n208\n00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.860\ngoing in a production environment, right?\n\n209\n00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.539\nAnd comp tia wants to make sure\nthat you're familiar with that.\n\n210\n00:09:50.539 --> 00:09:53.094\nThat, hey, once the install's done,\nyou're not actually done,\n\n211\n00:09:53.094 --> 00:09:55.110\nthat server's not ready for production.\n\n212\n00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.770\nThat a default install of most operating\nsystems will have vulnerabilities in it,\n\n213\n00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:00.770\nthey'll have weaknesses.\n\n214\n00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.910\nThings that people can exploit and\nit's not safe to deploy yet.\n\n215\n00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.220\nSo, what are some of\nthose follow-up steps?\n\n216\n00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.850\nWell, I mentioned some already, right?\n\n217\n00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:09.330\nI need to create a user account for\nmyself.\n\n218\n00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.225\nI need to change\npermissions on the system.\n\n219\n00:10:12.225 --> 00:10:14.845\nRight now, I'm logged in as administrator.\n\n220\n00:10:14.845 --> 00:10:17.025\nOr no I'm not,\nactually I'm logged in as Don Pezet.\n\n221\n00:10:17.025 --> 00:10:20.495\nSo I've already created my user account\nand forgotten about it apparently.\n\n222\n00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:22.315\nBut if I need to create a user account for\nmyself,\n\n223\n00:10:22.315 --> 00:10:26.615\nwhat I'll do is I'll go up here\nto Tools and Computer Management.\n\n224\n00:10:26.615 --> 00:10:30.925\nAnd the computer management utility let's\nus do several things that are related to\n\n225\n00:10:30.925 --> 00:10:33.370\nmaking sure our server's working\nthe way that it needs to be.\n\n226\n00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:37.050\nOne of which is to create local users and\ngroups.\n\n227\n00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.070\nAnd right here you can see there's that\ndefault administrator account I was\n\n228\n00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.550\ntalking about and here's the account\nI've made for myself, Don Pezet, right?\n\n229\n00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.750\nSo I was following proper\nsecurity practices apparently.\n\n230\n00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.560\nIf I hadn't done it yet,\n\n231\n00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.910\nI would just right click on User and\nchoose New User and create one for myself.\n\n232\n00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.084\nOnce you've got one for yourself,\nyou can log in as yourself.\n\n233\n00:10:55.084 --> 00:10:57.311\nAnd now that you're logged\nin with your own account,\n\n234\n00:10:57.311 --> 00:10:59.580\nyou can just disable\nthe administrator account.\n\n235\n00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.800\nWe don't need it anymore.\n\n236\n00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:06.470\nSo you can pull up its properties and\nyou can set it to disabled, right?\n\n237\n00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.290\nI'm disabling it, so what way if\nan attacker tries to break into\n\n238\n00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.400\nthe administrator account, that's fine.\n\n239\n00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.210\nThe account's disabled.\n\n240\n00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.940\nThey're not gonna be able to get in.\n\n241\n00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.888\nAnother option is, I could've just\nrenamed the administrator account.\n\n242\n00:11:16.888 --> 00:11:17.819\nA lot of people do that, too.\n\n243\n00:11:17.819 --> 00:11:19.840\nYou just take it in and\ngive it a new name.\n\n244\n00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.590\nI like to leave it there disabled.\n\n245\n00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.045\nThat way, I can enable it again\nin the future if I ever need it.\n\n246\n00:11:24.045 --> 00:11:25.781\nI probably won't, but just in case.\n\n247\n00:11:25.781 --> 00:11:26.600\nThat's what I like to do.\n\n248\n00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.260\nAll right, so creating a user account for\nourselves, that's important.\n\n249\n00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.410\nOn the Linux side we saw setting\na host name and the IP addressing.\n\n250\n00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.170\nSo I can switch back over\nto my server manager.\n\n251\n00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.690\nAnd we had the host name\nright here easy enough.\n\n252\n00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.940\nAnd when I click on that, I can go in and\nI see mine is auto-generated.\n\n253\n00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:50.375\nMine right now is WIN-GK400OT0TIO.\n\n254\n00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:52.420\nRolls right off the tongue.\n\n255\n00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.003\n&gt;&gt; It certainly does.\n\n256\n00:11:53.003 --> 00:11:55.920\n&gt;&gt; And oddly enough, it's pretty close\nto what I was gonna name it anyway.\n\n257\n00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.350\nBut we probably wanna change that\nto something not nonsensical.\n\n258\n00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.877\nSo I might wanna call\nthis one MAILSERVER1.\n\n259\n00:12:01.877 --> 00:12:03.260\nRight or whatever it is.\n\n260\n00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.871\nI'm typing it in all caps.\n\n261\n00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:06.562\nYou don't have to,\nyou type in whatever you want.\n\n262\n00:12:06.562 --> 00:12:09.938\nTechnically, if I was\nfollowing the standard,\n\n263\n00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:12.360\nDNS name should all be lowercase.\n\n264\n00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.020\nAnd ultimately this\nwill become a DNS name.\n\n265\n00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:20.730\nWhat I'm typing here under computer name,\nit's really a NetBIOS name.\n\n266\n00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:25.900\nWhat we used to use in the Windows world,\nbut it's gonna turn it into a DNS name.\n\n267\n00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.660\nWhere it says full\ncomputer name right here.\n\n268\n00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.850\nThis will be a fully qualified\ndomain name for DNS.\n\n269\n00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.100\nIt just doesn't have a DNS name yet.\n\n270\n00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.970\nAnd I can assign it a domain\nname by joining a domain.\n\n271\n00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.606\nIf I have an active directory domain,\nI can join it.\n\n272\n00:12:39.606 --> 00:12:42.410\nAnd I'll pull the domain in from that and\nit will populate here.\n\n273\n00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:45.530\nIf I don't have an active directory,\nthen I'm in a work group.\n\n274\n00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.010\nAnd in a work group,\nyou don't have DNS names.\n\n275\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.800\nSo for that I can choose More and\nthen I can punch in the DNS suffix.\n\n276\n00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:57.610\nSo I'm gonna do lab.itpro.tv and\nget that set, and there we go.\n\n277\n00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.950\nSo see now it looks like\na regular DNS name.\n\n278\n00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:04.740\nWell, if I had left this capitalized,\nit actually capitalizes it.\n\n279\n00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:08.140\nAnd DNS doesn't care about case\nsensitivity so it just looks weird.\n\n280\n00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.740\nDoesn't actually impact performance, but\n\n281\n00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.249\nI'm just picky enough that I like\nto put it in in all lowercase.\n\n282\n00:13:15.605 --> 00:13:19.114\nAll right, so once I've got that set,\nWindows does require a reboot to change\n\n283\n00:13:19.114 --> 00:13:22.320\nits name, unlike Linux where you can\nchange it and it's not a big deal.\n\n284\n00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.635\nHere in Windows we'll have to reboot.\n\n285\n00:13:23.635 --> 00:13:27.732\nAnd it all gets tied to entries that\nare going in the registry, in the SID and\n\n286\n00:13:27.732 --> 00:13:28.980\nall that other stuff.\n\n287\n00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.223\nSo it's gonna prompt me to reboot.\n\n288\n00:13:30.223 --> 00:13:33.430\nI'm not gonna reboot just yet cuz I'm\nnot done, so I'll say Restart Later.\n\n289\n00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.682\nAll right, my network interface,\nI could see ethernet0 right here.\n\n290\n00:13:37.682 --> 00:13:41.430\nIf I wanna change that, I can go in and\nI can pull up its properties.\n\n291\n00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.250\nAnd we can change its IP\naddress to a static IP, or\n\n292\n00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.250\nwe can make it dynamic or whatever.\n\n293\n00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:48.860\nIt's set to DHCP.\n\n294\n00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.450\nOn a server, I probably don't want that.\n\n295\n00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.816\nSo, I'll come in and make this one.\n\n296\n00:13:52.816 --> 00:13:57.000\n10.0.222.15, why not?\n\n297\n00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.540\nAnd I'll set my subnet mask and\nmy gateway.\n\n298\n00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.610\nJust get all that defined.\n\n299\n00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.482\nEasy enough here because I'm in a web UI,\nright?\n\n300\n00:14:06.482 --> 00:14:12.495\nNot a web UI but\na graphical user interface.\n\n301\n00:14:12.495 --> 00:14:14.880\nAll right, oops,\ndid I get the subnet wrong?\n\n302\n00:14:16.043 --> 00:14:17.298\nI did, shoot.\n\n303\n00:14:17.298 --> 00:14:20.655\nSee we gotta pay attention to our subnet,\nwhich fortunately Windows checked for\n\n304\n00:14:20.655 --> 00:14:22.830\nme cuz I put in the wrong subnet.\n\n305\n00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:23.688\nThere we go.\n\n306\n00:14:23.688 --> 00:14:27.361\nAnd now I've got that set, so\nthat's one more step off my list.\n\n307\n00:14:27.361 --> 00:14:31.677\nAll right, few other things that we\nneed to deal with, important things.\n\n308\n00:14:31.677 --> 00:14:36.360\nNow that my network is functioning,\nwell, let's back up on that real quick.\n\n309\n00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.330\nWhat if my network isn't functioning?\n\n310\n00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.070\nWhat if my network doesn't show up here?\n\n311\n00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.940\nAnother post installation\ntask is installing drivers.\n\n312\n00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.250\nI might be missing drivers for\nthis system.\n\n313\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:48.050\nThe hardware of my server might not\nbe what Windows or Linux expected.\n\n314\n00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.230\nWell, remember that utility\nI was in just a moment ago,\n\n315\n00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.290\nthe computer management utility?\n\n316\n00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:56.250\nWell, right inside of here,\nwe've got our device manager.\n\n317\n00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:00.580\nAnd you can choose the device manager and\nlook for any hardware that's missing.\n\n318\n00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.340\nIn Linux, you can use the dmesg\nutility which will show you\n\n319\n00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.326\nall the software that was detected\nduring the system bootup and\n\n320\n00:15:06.326 --> 00:15:10.005\nyou can look for things that are missing\nor things that weren't recognized.\n\n321\n00:15:10.005 --> 00:15:13.810\nAnd when you find something like that,\nyou can install the driver for it.\n\n322\n00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:17.480\nIn Windows, it'll show up as\nusually having a red circle or\n\n323\n00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.700\na yellow triangle by it, a question\nmark so you can identify that, hey,\n\n324\n00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.450\nit doesn't know what this is, and\nyou can go in and install the driver.\n\n325\n00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:27.680\nNow my server's an HP server, so\nI can just go to HP's website and\n\n326\n00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.720\ndownload all the drivers I need and\nload them in there.\n\n327\n00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.040\nOr if you have a Dell or a Lenovo,\nif you built your own server, well,\n\n328\n00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.530\nit's up to you to figure out\nwhere those drivers come from.\n\n329\n00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.380\nThat's one of the advantages of buying\na branded server is they have all\n\n330\n00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.250\nthe drivers in one place.\n\n331\n00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.929\nThe other thing is if you're\ndoing virtualization,\n\n332\n00:15:44.929 --> 00:15:46.802\nI'm actually on a virtual machine here.\n\n333\n00:15:46.802 --> 00:15:48.170\nThis is running on top of VM Ware.\n\n334\n00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.634\nSo if I have VM Ware in place,\nthat means some of my hardware's fake and\n\n335\n00:15:51.634 --> 00:15:55.689\nI'm gonna need drivers for that Well,\nVMware's in with Microsoft and Red Hat and\n\n336\n00:15:55.689 --> 00:15:57.955\nthe other guys so\ntheir drivers are baked in.\n\n337\n00:15:57.955 --> 00:15:59.071\nBut if they weren't,\n\n338\n00:15:59.071 --> 00:16:02.726\nI would have some virtual machine\nadditions that I would need to install.\n\n339\n00:16:02.726 --> 00:16:04.611\nVMware calls their VM Tools.\n\n340\n00:16:04.611 --> 00:16:06.352\nMicrosoft calls them VM additions.\n\n341\n00:16:06.352 --> 00:16:07.194\nIt's the same thing,\n\n342\n00:16:07.194 --> 00:16:10.122\nit's just a collection of drivers that\nmake the virtual machine recognize all\n\n343\n00:16:10.122 --> 00:16:11.112\nit's virtual hardware.\n\n344\n00:16:13.993 --> 00:16:17.553\nOnce I've done all my hardware working and\nmy network is up, it's time for\n\n345\n00:16:17.553 --> 00:16:20.220\nthe next step which is server hardening.\n\n346\n00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.120\nServer hardening is getting\nthis server protected and\n\n347\n00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.820\nready to be put out on the internet or\na production network or wherever, right?\n\n348\n00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.070\nAnd the key part of that is\ndoing patches and updates.\n\n349\n00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.050\nDoesn't matter how good\nyour operating system is.\n\n350\n00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:38.059\nDoesn't matter whether you're a Linux\nguy or a Windows or Mac OS or whatever.\n\n351\n00:16:38.059 --> 00:16:38.980\nThey all have exploits.\n\n352\n00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.291\nThey all have vulnerabilities and\nweaknesses and\n\n353\n00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:45.580\nthe operating system vendors all do\na great job of patching them quickly.\n\n354\n00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:49.520\nIt's us as the end users that normally\ndo a bad job of applying those updates.\n\n355\n00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:54.960\nSo, if I go back into my server manager,\nand I pull up my server,\n\n356\n00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.670\none of the things you'll notice\nright up here at the top right.\n\n357\n00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:01.440\nLast installed updates, Windows update,\nlast check for updates.\n\n358\n00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.200\nAnd it's showing me what my status is or\nit will as soon as it's done updating or\n\n359\n00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.382\nit won't, just gonna sit there.\n\n360\n00:17:08.382 --> 00:17:11.900\nSo, [LAUGH] So it's not showing that\nI've done any updates yet at all,\n\n361\n00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.640\nthat my updates are not\napparently configured.\n\n362\n00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.060\nSo I need to get that configured.\n\n363\n00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:21.390\nI need my system doing updates so\nthat I know it's patched and ready to go.\n\n364\n00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.810\nSo I'm gonna launch Windows Update.\n\n365\n00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:25.939\nAnd we'll get that set up.\n\n366\n00:17:25.939 --> 00:17:29.092\nAnd you'll see mine are not being\ninstalled automatically, and on a server,\n\n367\n00:17:29.092 --> 00:17:32.090\nmaybe you don't want them\ninstalled automatically.\n\n368\n00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.630\nWell, I usually want to\nat least download them.\n\n369\n00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.820\nI might not want to reboot automatically,\nbut I do want to download them.\n\n370\n00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.388\nSo when you go in and turn this on, you'll\nhave a couple of choices where you can set\n\n371\n00:17:41.388 --> 00:17:43.795\nthis up and configure how you\nwant it to do the updates.\n\n372\n00:17:43.795 --> 00:17:46.465\nRed Hat, same thing Ubuntu same thing.\n\n373\n00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:49.800\nThey all have update mechanisms,\nyou just need to configure them.\n\n374\n00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.310\nMost of them are off by default,\n\n375\n00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:55.570\nmost of them do not dynamically\nupdate unless you tell them to.\n\n376\n00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:57.400\nSo they are expecting manual updates and\n\n377\n00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.960\nif bad about it your service gonna get\nupdated and people gonna be a little\n\n378\n00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.130\nbreaking to it Not always security\nexploits though, there is also bugs.\n\n379\n00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.780\nYou can have a server that just freezes\nrandomly and you don't know why.\n\n380\n00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.950\nThat turns out there is an update\nthat would have fixed it but\n\n381\n00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:11.080\nyou haven't applied it yet.\n\n382\n00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.240\nSo checking for updates and\napplying them, really important.\n\n383\n00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.440\nThat's part of patching a server to\nmake sure that everything is secured,\n\n384\n00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.850\nit's part of hardening it.\n\n385\n00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:23.850\nThe other side of hardening it is removing\nanything you're not going to use.\n\n386\n00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.820\nIf there's software that was installed\nby default that I'm not gonna use,\n\n387\n00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.380\nI need to turn it off.\n\n388\n00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.910\nWell, fortunately during the Red Hat\ninstaller you saw where we get to\n\n389\n00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.580\npick exactly what went in.\n\n390\n00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.010\nAnd even here in Windows,\nit does the same thing.\n\n391\n00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.030\nIn Windows, it doesn't install\nanything extra by default.\n\n392\n00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.670\nAnd then we add in the roles and\nfeatures we want.\n\n393\n00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.700\nWhen I'm looking at my local server,\nI can go up here to manage and\n\n394\n00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.750\nchose add roles and features.\n\n395\n00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:52.490\nand here we'll get a screen that looks\nyearly similar to what we just saw in red\n\n396\n00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:57.960\nhand a few moments ago where I can\ncome through and tell it what I want.\n\n397\n00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.950\nSo, while I modify the server, I can tell\nit, hey I want to be a DNS Server, or\n\n398\n00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:06.410\na DHCP Server, an application server,\nI can pick and choose.\n\n399\n00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:09.510\nAnd on the next screen,\nI can even pick and choose, whoops.\n\n400\n00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:14.820\n[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH] Wrong screen\nagain, I will get it, there you go.\n\n401\n00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.260\nOn the next screen, I can even pick and\nchoose amongst tools,\n\n402\n00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.970\nlike little software packages and\nstuff that I might want to install.\n\n403\n00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.810\nMaybe I want the Telnet client\non my system, maybe I don't,\n\n404\n00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.840\nmaybe I'm not gonna use it,\ndon't install it.\n\n405\n00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.640\nSo you pick and\nchoose exactly what you want.\n\n406\n00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.760\nPart of hardening a server is just making\nsure that you have the minimum software\n\n407\n00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.260\nfootprint possible.\n\n408\n00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.600\nOn a workstation, you might go crazy,\nhave all sorts of stuff on there.\n\n409\n00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.470\nI've got Microsoft Access\ninstalled on my computer,\n\n410\n00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:43.350\nI don't think I've ever even launched it.\n\n411\n00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.550\nBut I don't worry about that,\nit's my work station.\n\n412\n00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:50.460\nBut on a server, I wanna have the minimal\nset of software needed for it\n\n413\n00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:54.620\nto do its job cuz I don't wanna waste time\nupdating software that's not being used.\n\n414\n00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:58.100\nI don't wanna have to reboot my\nserver to apply an update for\n\n415\n00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.160\nsoftware that I'm not even using, that's\njust creating downtime for no reason.\n\n416\n00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.980\nSo get all that stuff off of there.\n\n417\n00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.320\nIf you don't know what's safe to remove,\ngo to the vendor websites, Microsoft,\n\n418\n00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.150\nRed Hat, Canonical all those\nguys put out hardening guides.\n\n419\n00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:15.010\nYou can actually go and download they have\na PDF that gives all sorts of steps and\n\n420\n00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:19.260\ninstructions on how you can harden\nthat server and disable features.\n\n421\n00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:23.230\nAny services you're not using, they\nreally do a good job of detailing that.\n\n422\n00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.600\nBut it's different for\nevery distro and different for\n\n423\n00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.840\nevery way that you're\ngonna use the server.\n\n424\n00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.233\nSo you've always gotta make sure\nyou take that into account.\n\n425\n00:20:31.492 --> 00:20:33.736\nAll right, the last thing that I have,\n\n426\n00:20:33.736 --> 00:20:39.410\nwhich I think the think the last thing\nthat I've got is performance optimization.\n\n427\n00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:44.170\nOn the performance side, when you do that\ndefault install, the server might not be\n\n428\n00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:48.050\nrunning at peak performance, and there's\na few things that we need to tweak.\n\n429\n00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:51.990\nThere's things like, well,\nin Windows, the page file, right?\n\n430\n00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:56.770\nUnder Linux, I created the swap\npartition during the install.\n\n431\n00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:57.870\nBut on Windows, I didn't.\n\n432\n00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.220\nOn Windows, here, let me get to it.\n\n433\n00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.940\nOn Windows, it just Just made the file.\n\n434\n00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.537\nIf we were to browse to our hard drive\n\n435\n00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:15.960\nAnd do a dir/a, then in here,\nwe will find, right here, pagefile.sys.\n\n436\n00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.170\nIt just made a page file for me and\nit's right here on the drive.\n\n437\n00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:20.300\nBut I might need to tweak and\n\n438\n00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.530\ncustomize that to get it to\nperform the way that I want to.\n\n439\n00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.900\nAnd so, there's a few different\nways that you can go about that.\n\n440\n00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:31.580\nBut when we pull up our system\nproperties into our advanced settings.\n\n441\n00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.380\nLet's see if I can remember exactly\nwhere this is under performance.\n\n442\n00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:40.800\n&gt;&gt; 20 clicks later under Advanced,\nthere we go.\n\n443\n00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.720\nHere's my virtual memory.\n\n444\n00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:46.780\nAnd you'll see my total paging file\nsize is right now is 1.4 Gigs.\n\n445\n00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:52.821\nAnd if I go in to change,\nI can modify the size of the paging file.\n\n446\n00:21:52.821 --> 00:21:54.254\nI can change what drive its on,\n\n447\n00:21:54.254 --> 00:21:57.855\nmaybe I want the page file to be on its\nown drive so I can move it somewhere else.\n\n448\n00:21:57.855 --> 00:22:01.342\nI can set minimum and maximum sizes for\nit, so it can grow and shrink.\n\n449\n00:22:01.342 --> 00:22:04.701\nNow we can completely customize\nhow it works for our environment.\n\n450\n00:22:04.701 --> 00:22:06.950\nMost of us, don't worry about this\nany more cuz page files don't get\n\n451\n00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:08.000\nused like that.\n\n452\n00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.891\nBut, if you're still using your page file,\nthese are all\n\n453\n00:22:10.891 --> 00:22:14.860\nthings we can customize to improve\nperformance and scalability of the server.\n\n454\n00:22:17.254 --> 00:22:20.907\nThe other thing is,\njust general optimizations.\n\n455\n00:22:20.907 --> 00:22:25.321\nOptimizations, like disabling\ncertain features or simple things,\n\n456\n00:22:25.321 --> 00:22:29.355\nlike if I know, I'm gonna be\nremoting into the server a lot, and\n\n457\n00:22:29.355 --> 00:22:33.490\nit's got some kind of\ngraphics-intensive wallpaper, Right?\n\n458\n00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:37.030\nMicrosoft used to do that with these big,\nflashy Windows logos and stuff.\n\n459\n00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.590\nWhen you remote desktop in,\nit makes the connection slower,\n\n460\n00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.000\ncuz it's gotta load that background.\n\n461\n00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.010\nSo changing the background to something\ngray, like this, makes it more simple,\n\n462\n00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.830\nmakes it a little better\non the performance side.\n\n463\n00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:52.060\nThere's other tweaks too, like disabling\nservices that you're not using.\n\n464\n00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:55.338\nSo if I were to go into\nthe Services Utility and\n\n465\n00:22:55.338 --> 00:22:59.738\ntake a look at all the services\nthat are running on my system,\n\n466\n00:22:59.738 --> 00:23:04.507\nmany of these services may be important,\nmany of them may not be.\n\n467\n00:23:04.507 --> 00:23:09.025\nAnd everyone that I disable is\na little bit less load on the server.\n\n468\n00:23:09.025 --> 00:23:11.370\nIt's gonna make it perform\na little bit better, right?\n\n469\n00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.710\nThese are additional tweaks and it's gonna\nvary based on the operating system and\n\n470\n00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:15.310\nbased on your use.\n\n471\n00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.810\nNow, the last thing, and this is probably\nthe best piece of advice I can give you,\n\n472\n00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:23.840\nonce you finished configuring the server,\nand\n\n473\n00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.980\neverything's done,\nthe next step is documentation.\n\n474\n00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.830\nYou've gotta document everything that\nyou did to build that server up.\n\n475\n00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:34.050\nSo that if there's ever a failure,\nhow do you rebuild that server?\n\n476\n00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.700\nHow do you get a back up in going in?\n\n477\n00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.660\nYou need all those steps.\n\n478\n00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.970\nYou need that configuration documented,\nright?\n\n479\n00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:43.330\nAlso, if we wanna build up additional\nversion on that server, something changes.\n\n480\n00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:46.543\nWe need you to making sure that\nour documentation's up to date,\n\n481\n00:23:46.543 --> 00:23:48.394\nthat is current, that is accurate.\n\n482\n00:23:48.394 --> 00:23:52.774\nBut another cool thing you can include\nin the documentation is something called\n\n483\n00:23:52.774 --> 00:23:54.354\nthe performance baseline.\n\n484\n00:23:54.354 --> 00:23:57.066\nHave you ever had a system,\nit happens with me with laptops.\n\n485\n00:23:57.066 --> 00:24:00.470\nI get a brand new laptop, I'm like, man\nthis is the fastest laptop I've ever had.\n\n486\n00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:04.350\nAnd then a year later,\nyou'll hear me saying,\n\n487\n00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:07.760\nI hate this laptop,\nit's the slowest laptop I've ever had.\n\n488\n00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:13.180\nWell, is it actually slow, or did I just\nget used to it over that year and forget?\n\n489\n00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:17.730\nAnd in my perception it's slow, but it's\nactually just as fast as the day I got it.\n\n490\n00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:18.530\nIs it?\n\n491\n00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:19.090\nMaybe it isn't.\n\n492\n00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:22.770\nMaybe I've just gunked it up\nwith too much software, right?\n\n493\n00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.670\nOn a server we have the same problem.\n\n494\n00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:28.469\nA year later, is the server running\nat the same speed you thought it was?\n\n495\n00:24:28.469 --> 00:24:31.840\nA user calls us, aah,\nthe email server's slow!\n\n496\n00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.750\nIs it?\n\n497\n00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.304\nIt might be,\nmaybe you added 100 new employees and\n\n498\n00:24:35.304 --> 00:24:38.102\nthe email database has grown large,\nand yeah it's slow.\n\n499\n00:24:38.102 --> 00:24:42.050\nOr maybe it's running at\nthe same speed it always has.\n\n500\n00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:45.609\nAnd this user's just complaining cuz they\nlike to complain, which most users do.\n\n501\n00:24:45.609 --> 00:24:51.230\nSo, what we need to do is right now,\nwhile the server is done and configured.\n\n502\n00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:54.160\nAnd it has optimal settings and\neverything is great.\n\n503\n00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.318\nWe need to take a performance baseline.\n\n504\n00:24:55.318 --> 00:24:59.880\nWe need to record the levels\nthat it's running at right now.\n\n505\n00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.560\nSo that when somebody calls and says,\n\n506\n00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:07.030\nhey the server's slow, we can run\nthe same report then and compare the two.\n\n507\n00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:09.927\nAnd compare it and say no, no, it's\nactually the same as it's always been.\n\n508\n00:25:09.927 --> 00:25:13.209\nOr, you're right,\nlook the CPU is pegged out at 100% and\n\n509\n00:25:13.209 --> 00:25:16.950\nit isn't normally like that, and\nwe need something to compare it to.\n\n510\n00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:20.203\nWe have utilities like the Task Manager,\nwhere if I pull up the Task Manager,\n\n511\n00:25:20.203 --> 00:25:22.572\nit will show me how the server's\nperforming right now.\n\n512\n00:25:22.572 --> 00:25:24.660\nWell it'll show me eventually.\n\n513\n00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.770\nThere we go.\nHow the server's performing right now,\n\n514\n00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.810\nI can see my CPU and memory and ethernet.\n\n515\n00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:34.190\nBut how useful is this information if I\ndon't have anything to compare it to?\n\n516\n00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:38.250\nIt's showing me 60 seconds\nin the life of this server.\n\n517\n00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:41.240\nSo I can compare it to 59 seconds ago.\n\n518\n00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.302\nBut how useful is that, right?\n\n519\n00:25:43.302 --> 00:25:45.300\nI need something more.\n\n520\n00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.760\nI need something that can go back in time.\n\n521\n00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.640\nAnd different distros\nhave different utilities.\n\n522\n00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.348\nThere's tons of third\nparty software out there,\n\n523\n00:25:52.348 --> 00:25:53.697\nreally good stuff that can do this too.\n\n524\n00:25:53.697 --> 00:25:58.090\nI really like the Dell Spotlight software,\nwhich is amazing for Linux and Windows.\n\n525\n00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:01.301\nBut just right here, in Windows,\n\n526\n00:26:01.301 --> 00:26:07.250\nwe have the Performance Monitor and\nthe Resource Monitor.\n\n527\n00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.174\nPerformance Monitor's a little better for\n\n528\n00:26:09.174 --> 00:26:11.462\nhistorical data cuz what we\ncan do is we can come in and\n\n529\n00:26:11.462 --> 00:26:14.844\nyou can create a performance monitor\nthat's tracking various activities.\n\n530\n00:26:14.844 --> 00:26:18.866\nBut you can actually create it\nas a data collector set, and\n\n531\n00:26:18.866 --> 00:26:22.640\nrecord the data, and\ngenerate reports on it.\n\n532\n00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:28.560\nSo you can record the performance of\nthe system today and generate a report.\n\n533\n00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.950\nAnd then six months from now,\nwhen you think the server's running slow,\n\n534\n00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:37.210\nyou can collect the same data,\ngenerate a report, and compare the two.\n\n535\n00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:40.240\nThat performance baseline is really\n\n536\n00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.900\nimportant cuz it gives you\nsomething to compare to.\n\n537\n00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:47.531\nYou need to know how it ran when things\nwere good to actually know whether or\n\n538\n00:26:47.531 --> 00:26:48.810\nnot things run bad.\n\n539\n00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:50.788\nRight, that's what's really important.\n\n540\n00:26:50.788 --> 00:26:53.846\nAnd so if I wanted to whip something\nup really quick I can come here under.\n\n541\n00:26:53.846 --> 00:26:55.831\nI could actually choose\none of these default ones.\n\n542\n00:26:55.831 --> 00:26:59.925\nThere's default performance monitor\ncollector sets that have been created,\n\n543\n00:26:59.925 --> 00:27:02.800\nlike system diagnostics or\nsystem performance.\n\n544\n00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.529\nAnd these are pretty good for\ncreating a baseline.\n\n545\n00:27:05.529 --> 00:27:10.069\nIf you take a look at it, Microsoft\nhas picked processor, physical disk,\n\n546\n00:27:10.069 --> 00:27:11.810\nmemory, network, right?\n\n547\n00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:12.540\nThe big four.\n\n548\n00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.760\nThose are the big four\nperformance areas of a server.\n\n549\n00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.405\nAnd that's probably good enough for\n\n550\n00:27:16.405 --> 00:27:18.852\nme to gather a good set of\ndata right here to compare on.\n\n551\n00:27:18.852 --> 00:27:23.810\nAnd so, what I can do is I can\nlaunch this collector set.\n\n552\n00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:25.240\nI can actually get it up and running.\n\n553\n00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:30.050\nSo, I'm just gonna choose Start and\nit's running, and let it run.\n\n554\n00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.900\nLet it run for 30 minutes or an hour or\nhowever long it is you need it to run.\n\n555\n00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.470\nBest to let it run all day.\n\n556\n00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:36.825\nBecause think about your work, right?\n\n557\n00:27:36.825 --> 00:27:38.527\nYou've got peak times and slow times.\n\n558\n00:27:38.527 --> 00:27:41.425\nEight in the morning, everybody's showing\nup at work, things are really busy.\n\n559\n00:27:41.425 --> 00:27:44.611\nThen 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock,\npeople settle into meetings,\n\n560\n00:27:44.611 --> 00:27:47.330\nthey're not really hitting your servers so\nhard anymore.\n\n561\n00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:49.400\nPeople go to lunch,\nthings get really slow.\n\n562\n00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.950\nThen 1 o'clock, people get back from\nlunch, things get really busy again.\n\n563\n00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:55.110\nAnd then towards 5 o'clock,\nit tapers off as everybody goes home.\n\n564\n00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.700\nSo depending on when you collect data,\nit might not be accurate.\n\n565\n00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.830\nYou need to gather the whole day so\nyou can compare it.\n\n566\n00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:03.080\nAnd that sounds like a lot\nof data because it is.\n\n567\n00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.470\nI'm gathering data once a second,\nI think was the default.\n\n568\n00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:09.060\nPretty frequently,\nall throughout that day.\n\n569\n00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:13.550\nThat's where the reports come in, is that\nonce we've gathered some data together,\n\n570\n00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.930\nand I'm not gonna run this long\nenough to have usable data.\n\n571\n00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:19.590\nBut once you've gathered the data\ntogether, then you can come down and\n\n572\n00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:22.953\nyou can pull up a report,\nlike one of these performance reports.\n\n573\n00:28:22.953 --> 00:28:27.937\nAnd it'll give you the top disk IO,\nor the high disk queue length,\n\n574\n00:28:27.937 --> 00:28:30.300\nthe total CPU percentage.\n\n575\n00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:35.060\nIt'll lay this stuff out in a report\nformat that becomes very easy to compare.\n\n576\n00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:39.250\nI can take this, or take a screenshot\nof this, stick it in my documentation.\n\n577\n00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.680\nAnd then, six months from now,\n\n578\n00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.520\nif I'm seeing bad performance I can come\nin here and look at it and compare it.\n\n579\n00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.180\nAnd maybe right now my memory\nutilization is 30% and\n\n580\n00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:52.314\nsix months from now people are complaining\nit's slow, and my memory's at 95%.\n\n581\n00:28:52.314 --> 00:28:54.980\nI'm like ooh, I need to add more memory.\n\n582\n00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.060\nOr, what's eating up all that memory?\n\n583\n00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.090\nWhy am I out of memory?\n\n584\n00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:01.800\nMaybe there's something, a memory\nleak in some software I'm running.\n\n585\n00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.629\nAnd now we can go and troubleshoot.\n\n586\n00:29:02.629 --> 00:29:04.870\nFine, we know what to look for, right?\n\n587\n00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:07.543\nWe wouldn't know if we didn't\nhave anything to compare it to.\n\n588\n00:29:07.543 --> 00:29:10.670\nMy memory is at 90%, is that good or bad?\n\n589\n00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:12.110\nIs it always at 90%?\n\n590\n00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:13.750\nMaybe that's normal, right?\n\n591\n00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:15.410\nIt's using the resources it has.\n\n592\n00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.150\nWe have to have a way to determine that.\n\n593\n00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:19.995\nSo that's kinda the key thing\nwith a performance baseline.\n\n594\n00:29:19.995 --> 00:29:24.470\nAnd once we've got that, now the server's\nready to push out into production.\n\n595\n00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:26.430\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, well,\nthat's a lot of great information.\n\n596\n00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.760\nKeep in mind, guys, this is a part 4.\n\n597\n00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.560\nSo if you're just joining us now, go back\nand watch some of those original parts,\n\n598\n00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.568\nor the first parts I should say.\n\n599\n00:29:34.568 --> 00:29:36.800\nNow Don, it does look like we're\ncoming to the end of another episode.\n\n600\n00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.510\nBut before we do,\n\n601\n00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:39.911\ndo you have any additional words\nthat you might like to throw or\n\n602\n00:29:39.911 --> 00:29:44.000\nimpart to our viewers, when it comes to\ninstalling your server operating system?\n\n603\n00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.191\n&gt;&gt; Ideally, two things, right?\n\n604\n00:29:45.191 --> 00:29:47.100\nOne, make sure you're\nmaking the right decisions.\n\n605\n00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.550\nCuz some of them,\nyou can change anything after the fact.\n\n606\n00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:52.320\nBut some are really hard to change,\nlike choosing a file system or\n\n607\n00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.260\npartition layout.\n\n608\n00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.278\nThat stuff's a pain in\nthe butt to change later on.\n\n609\n00:29:54.278 --> 00:29:58.550\nSo make decisions right early on,\nif you can.\n\n610\n00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:02.625\nAnd then two, document things so\nyou can consistently deploy servers.\n\n611\n00:30:02.625 --> 00:30:06.040\nYou don't want a hundred servers\nconfigured a hundred different ways.\n\n612\n00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.540\nYou wanna make sure they were all deployed\nusing the same methodical approach so\n\n613\n00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:12.690\nthat everything is consistent and\nfar easier to support.\n\n614\n00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:15.120\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, as always,\nwe appreciate that information.\n\n615\n00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.900\nWe do appreciate you,\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n616\n00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.890\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n617\n00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:21.667\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n618\n00:30:21.667 --> 00:30:29.120\n[MUSIC]\n\n619\n00:30:29.120 -->

[NOISE]\n\n3\n00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:08.247\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.247 --> 00:00:10.903\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.903 --> 00:00:14.901\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another\ngreat episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:16.560\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.944\nAnd in today's episode, we're continuing\nthrough our series in CompTIA Server+.\n\n8\n00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:23.324\nAnd we talked about a lot of\ndifferent concepts so far.\n\n9\n00:00:23.324 --> 00:00:24.340\nWhat are we doing today?\n\n10\n00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.390\nWell, we've got Don Pezet\nhere to let us know.\n\n11\n00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.166\nDon, how you doing sir?\n\n12\n00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.274\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n13\n00:00:28.274 --> 00:00:31.701\nIn this episode, we're going to be\ntaking a look at server hardware again.\n\n14\n00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:33.529\nWell, we've talked about\nhardware a good bit,\n\n15\n00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:35.234\nall of the good components\nthat are in there.\n\n16\n00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:37.370\nAnd we know there's a lot of variety.\n\n17\n00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.970\nWell, how do we pick what it is that\nwe want or need in one of our servers?\n\n18\n00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.570\nAnd there is kind of a one-size-fits-all\nmodel out there when you go to HP,\n\n19\n00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.080\nor Dell, or Lenovo's website,\n\n20\n00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.950\nwhere they kind of want to sell\nyou this one standard solution.\n\n21\n00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.420\nBut the reality of it is there's\ncustomizations we can make that\n\n22\n00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.890\nbenefit our need, right?\n\n23\n00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.310\nSo if we're bringing up a Web server,\n\n24\n00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.510\nit's got very different needs\nthan a database server.\n\n25\n00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.370\nWhich has very different\nneeds than a file server.\n\n26\n00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.460\nEach one has unique performance profiles.\n\n27\n00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.230\nAnd we can build our servers to\nmeet the needs of that profile.\n\n28\n00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.110\nNow, when I say build,\nI don't mean that we're going to go and\n\n29\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.260\norder a bunch of parts.\n\n30\n00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.213\nI mean, when we go to HP's website and\n\n31\n00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:22.879\nwe're checking off little boxes on\na server, we're picking the right\n\n32\n00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:26.684\nequipment that we need to benefit our\nhardware and benefit our software.\n\n33\n00:01:26.684 --> 00:01:28.099\nSo that's what we're\ngoing to look at here,\n\n34\n00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:29.365\nis we're just going to run down a list.\n\n35\n00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:32.498\nCompTIA actually has in the exam\nobjectives, they've got 10 or\n\n36\n00:01:32.498 --> 00:01:34.870\n11 different server roles\nthat are out there.\n\n37\n00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.677\nAnd we just need to understand\nthe performance characteristics of each to\n\n38\n00:01:37.677 --> 00:01:39.362\nmake sure that we're designed optimally.\n\n39\n00:01:39.362 --> 00:01:43.270\nNow before I dive into all the different\nroles, let me just start off.\n\n40\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.040\nI'm gonna go a little out of\norder from the objectives, and\n\n41\n00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.875\nwe'll just start off\nwith database servers.\n\n42\n00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:49.870\nCuz I want to tell you a story\nabout why this matters, right.\n\n43\n00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.990\nWhen you buy a server, it's got CPU,\nmemory, hard drives or\n\n44\n00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.810\ndisks of some sort, and network adapters.\n\n45\n00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.420\nThose we call the big four\nin the performance world.\n\n46\n00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.950\nWhen you have a server\nthat's running slow,\n\n47\n00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.670\nit's usually one of those four things\nthat you don't have enough of, and\n\n48\n00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.460\nyou need more of it to make\nthe server run fast again.\n\n49\n00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.060\nSometimes it's more than one\nof those four components.\n\n50\n00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.190\nBut those four things are the key items\nthat are going to influence performance\n\n51\n00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.620\non your system.\n\n52\n00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.120\nAnd I've had the opportunity over the\nyears to work on several different servers\n\n53\n00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.560\nwhere they had a hardware bottleneck.\n\n54\n00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.770\nAnd we were able to build\na solution to correct that.\n\n55\n00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.570\nAnd sometimes It doesn't necessarily mean\nwe need to go and buy different hardware.\n\n56\n00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.040\nIt might just be a matter\nof re-configuring\n\n57\n00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.780\nthe hardware that we already\nhave to use it more efficiently.\n\n58\n00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.120\nAnd there's no better example\nof that then databases.\n\n59\n00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.560\nSo let me just show you kind of a template\nthat I'm going to use here in this show.\n\n60\n00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.530\nI've got this little diagram worked up.\n\n61\n00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.280\nAnd it's kind of representative\nof the components\n\n62\n00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.300\nof hardware we might have in a system,\nright.\n\n63\n00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.120\nYou might have multiple CPUs.\n\n64\n00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.288\nAnd there might be more than\none core in each CPU, right,\n\n65\n00:02:51.288 --> 00:02:53.607\ndepending on the type of CPU that you buy.\n\n66\n00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:58.151\nYou may have one or more network cards,\nmultiple sticks of memory,\n\n67\n00:02:58.151 --> 00:03:01.930\nas well as multiple hard drives or\nsolid state drives.\n\n68\n00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.910\nI couldn't make up my mind, so\n\n69\n00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.720\nI kinda just put them both on there,\nwhen you buy a server.\n\n70\n00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.927\nNow I drew this up with\nfour physical CPUs.\n\n71\n00:03:09.927 --> 00:03:11.720\nYou're probably not gonna have that.\n\n72\n00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.630\nA lot of servers these days come\nwith only one or two physical CPUs,\n\n73\n00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.930\nbecause we have multiple\ncores inside of it.\n\n74\n00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.240\nBut you can get them with multiple\nphysical CPUs if you need even more cores.\n\n75\n00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.600\nThe same thing with network adaptors.\n\n76\n00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.720\nYou might have multiple network adaptors,\nor\n\n77\n00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.500\nyou might have a single network\nadaptor with multiple ports on it.\n\n78\n00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.630\nThat happens frequently too.\n\n79\n00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.810\nOn the hard drive side,\nyou might only have one hard drive.\n\n80\n00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.600\nYou might have no hard drives if you're\ndoing a boot from SAN type solution.\n\n81\n00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.310\nOr you might have eight hard drives\nlike I've done here in the diagram.\n\n82\n00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.480\nAnd on the memory side, you may have just\ntwo memory sticks, or four, or whatever.\n\n83\n00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.370\nThere's all sorts of variations.\n\n84\n00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.540\nSo when you buy a server,\nyou have to make these decisions.\n\n85\n00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.990\nThese are all choices that come up.\n\n86\n00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.800\nIf I were to go to Dell's\nwebsite to buy a server,\n\n87\n00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.770\nit's going to ask me how\nmuch memory I want to pick.\n\n88\n00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.620\nAnd I've got choices that might\nnot make a whole lot of sense\n\n89\n00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.010\nif I'm just trying to get\na general purpose server.\n\n90\n00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.250\nI might not care about it.\n\n91\n00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.820\nFor example, if I want to get 16 gigs of\nRAM in this server, and you go to buy\n\n92\n00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:13.690\nit there might be one configuration that\nhas four 4-gig memory sticks, right?\n\n93\n00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.600\nSo if I said, four 4-gig memory sticks,\n\n94\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.640\nthat would be just taking\nup these first four slots.\n\n95\n00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.360\nAnd if each one was 4 gigs,\nthat would be 16 gigs of ram.\n\n96\n00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.620\nThe other 4 gigs would be empty,\nand so now I'm good.\n\n97\n00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.270\nI got my 16 gigs that I wanted.\n\n98\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.028\nAnd I've got four slots available for\nexpansion, it sounds great.\n\n99\n00:04:33.028 --> 00:04:38.680\nBut you might also see where\nthey have eight 2-gig sticks.\n\n100\n00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.970\nSo instead of just taking up four slots,\nI could take up all eight slots and\n\n101\n00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.830\nstill get 16 gigs of ram.\n\n102\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.650\nAnd a lot of people look at that and\nsay, well, I don't wanna do that.\n\n103\n00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.360\nBecause if I do that,\nif I ever want to expand,\n\n104\n00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.640\nI've gotta take sticks out\nto make room for more.\n\n105\n00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.615\nBut if your motherboard on that\nserver supports dual channel or\n\n106\n00:04:58.615 --> 00:05:03.260\nmulti-channel memory,\nyou can actually benefit from having more\n\n107\n00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.840\nseparate memory sticks than by\nhaving fewer memory sticks.\n\n108\n00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.562\nBy taking advantage of the extra channels,\n\n109\n00:05:09.562 --> 00:05:12.319\nI might be able to access more than\none of these sticks at the same time.\n\n110\n00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:17.167\nAnd if I had two 8-gig sticks,\nversus eight 2-gig sticks,\n\n111\n00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:20.890\nthat's a much different level of access.\n\n112\n00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.100\nNow on memory,\nthat really comes down to the motherboard.\n\n113\n00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.130\nBut on hard drives, it's absolutely true.\n\n114\n00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.560\nIf I need one terabyte of hard\ndrive storage, I can get a single,\n\n115\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.400\none terabyte drive.\n\n116\n00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.300\nAnd now I've got one drive to talk to.\n\n117\n00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.600\nAnd if it's serial ATA,\n\n118\n00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.810\nif it's a SATA disk, I can only be\nsending it one command at a time.\n\n119\n00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.220\nIf it's a spinning disk,\n\n120\n00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.310\nthe physical motor on it can only\nposition the arms in one place at a time.\n\n121\n00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.740\nIf I had gotten four 250-gig disks though,\nwhen I have\n\n122\n00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.550\nfour 250-gig disks, I get a terabyte just\nlike I would have on that single drive.\n\n123\n00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.640\nBut now I've got four separate SATA disks\nthat I can talk to simultaneously, or\n\n124\n00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.400\nfour different physical motors\nI can move simultaneously.\n\n125\n00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.040\nIf I've got SAS drives,\nserial attached SCSI, four different\n\n126\n00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.870\nserial attached SCSI drives that I\ncan address and access independently.\n\n127\n00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.560\nI'm going to get four times\nthe performance out of this, aren't I?\n\n128\n00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.740\nIt benefits us to have more a lot of\ntimes, than it does to have less.\n\n129\n00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.300\nSo don't plan on expansion.\n\n130\n00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.538\nAnd the reason I'm going to say that\nis a lot of people plan for expansion.\n\n131\n00:06:29.538 --> 00:06:32.120\nThey say yeah, yeah,\nI want to leave extra memory banks open,\n\n132\n00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.500\nbecause I can get more memory later on.\n\n133\n00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.613\nMost people never do.\n\n134\n00:06:35.613 --> 00:06:38.440\nYou end up running that server for\nthree, four, five years.\n\n135\n00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.750\nAnd then you decommission it,\nand you never upgraded it.\n\n136\n00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.030\nAnd instead,\nwhen it comes time to upgrade,\n\n137\n00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.930\nit's just easier to buy a new server.\n\n138\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.260\nOr hey,\nI got it with two empty CPU sockets.\n\n139\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.996\nAnd by the time I decided\nto add two more CPUs,\n\n140\n00:06:49.996 --> 00:06:53.388\nthey don't have the exact\nfamily in stepping anymore.\n\n141\n00:06:53.388 --> 00:06:55.846\nI can't get a matching CPU and\nit's not gonna work.\n\n142\n00:06:55.846 --> 00:06:57.680\nI have to replace all four of them.\n\n143\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.050\nSo it's not cost effective,\nit doesn't make sense to do that.\n\n144\n00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.972\nSo on desktops, on workstations at home,\nor whatever, you might think of that.\n\n145\n00:07:04.972 --> 00:07:07.230\nBut in a datacenter,\nwe don't think of that.\n\n146\n00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.980\nWe don't worry about that.\n\n147\n00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.110\nYou want to maximize performance,\nperformance is all you care about.\n\n148\n00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.230\nYeah, well, money [LAUGH] is an issue for\nmost of us, unless you work for\n\n149\n00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.080\nthe government.\n\n150\n00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.150\nBut otherwise, performance is\nwhat we're thinking about, right?\n\n151\n00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.060\nWe want to make sure this thing\nperforms as fast as possible.\n\n152\n00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.954\nSo multiple smaller hard drives will\ngive you better performance than fewer\n\n153\n00:07:25.954 --> 00:07:27.700\nlarge hard drives.\n\n154\n00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.240\nAlso, you have to think about\nthe mean time between failure, right.\n\n155\n00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.730\nHow long does it take\nbefore an item fails?\n\n156\n00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.510\nAnd if I have a single large disk and\nit fails,\n\n157\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.820\nI'm going to lose a large amount of data.\n\n158\n00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.710\nIf I have a bunch of smaller disks, I'm\ngoing to lose smaller portions of data.\n\n159\n00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.170\nWhich, in a RAID array, can be\nrebuilt a lot faster than large data.\n\n160\n00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.230\nThe other thing is when large\nstorage media first comes out,\n\n161\n00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.142\nit's usually,\nwe'll use spinning disks as an example.\n\n162\n00:07:54.142 --> 00:07:56.388\nInside of a spinning disk,\nyou have platters.\n\n163\n00:07:56.388 --> 00:08:01.362\nAnd when a new size comes out,\nlet's say 12 terabyte drives come out.\n\n164\n00:08:01.362 --> 00:08:04.167\nThere'll probably be four\ndifferent platters inside there.\n\n165\n00:08:04.167 --> 00:08:06.660\nFour different platters\nthat could all fail.\n\n166\n00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.610\nBut over a few years, they become more\nefficient and all of a sudden there's 12\n\n167\n00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.510\nterabyte drives that only have\ntwo platters inside of them.\n\n168\n00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:16.060\nOr one platter inside of them,\nwhich is less components to fail.\n\n169\n00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:16.730\nAnd easier for\n\n170\n00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.100\nthe motor to spin, which means it's\ngonna go longer without failing.\n\n171\n00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.720\nSo if you're adopting\ncutting edge technology,\n\n172\n00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.440\nyou might find that you have\nfailures more frequently.\n\n173\n00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.510\nVersus if you had just taken the slightly\nolder technology, and maybe you had to\n\n174\n00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.820\nmore hard drives to get the storage you\nneed, you'll get more reliable technology.\n\n175\n00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:37.050\nThese are all things that need to weigh in\nto our selections when we buy hardware and\n\n176\n00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.250\npick our design and so on.\n\n177\n00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.109\nSo, the story I wanna tell you is, I had\na chance to work on a database server\n\n178\n00:08:43.109 --> 00:08:45.515\nseveral years ago,\nalmost ten years ago now.\n\n179\n00:08:45.515 --> 00:08:51.361\nWhere they had a database that was\nspread across an array of 14 drives.\n\n180\n00:08:51.361 --> 00:08:55.230\nAnd it was RAID 5 array,\nRAID 5 array across 14 drives.\n\n181\n00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.520\nSo it had parity calculations\nthat were being done on it.\n\n182\n00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.600\nAnd a RAID 5 arrays will give\nyou great read performance.\n\n183\n00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.150\nBut the write performance is not as great,\n\n184\n00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.910\ncuz you're having to calculate parity and\nstripe it.\n\n185\n00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.720\nSo they would run this\nparticular set of queries,\n\n186\n00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.580\nit was a report they would run and\nthe report took three days to run.\n\n187\n00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.980\nIt took a long time to run, and so over\nthe course of three days it would do all\n\n188\n00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.140\nits calculations,\nthrashing the discs the whole time,\n\n189\n00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.820\nand when it was done it\nwould spit out this report.\n\n190\n00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.870\nAnd they asked me if there was\na way we could make it faster.\n\n191\n00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:27.050\nAnd so I sat down and I looked at the\nquery and in database software, there's\n\n192\n00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.340\na lot of stuff you can do in the software\nto make things faster, like indexing and\n\n193\n00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:35.930\nso on, but on the hard drives,\nthe disk I/O can always be improved, too.\n\n194\n00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.510\nWhen you write to RAID 5\nyou've gotta calculate parity.\n\n195\n00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.890\nThat's a mathematical operation\nthat takes a little bit of time,\n\n196\n00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.030\nand with a hardware RAID controller\nthat's normally taken care of for you,\n\n197\n00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.870\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n198\n00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.580\nBut if you're doing it in software\nit's being done by your CPU and\n\n199\n00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:50.510\nthat slows things down.\n\n200\n00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.190\nThis one was being done in hardware.\n\n201\n00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.060\nBut that array that was laid out, actually\nturned out not to be just one RAID 5\n\n202\n00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:00.490\narray, it was a couple of different ones\nand they were divided up inefficiently.\n\n203\n00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:04.330\nAnd what we did is, we ended up taking\nthose drives and reconfiguring them.\n\n204\n00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:08.570\nI took two and separated them out for the\noperating system, it's just their mirror.\n\n205\n00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.130\nAnd I took two more and separated\nthem out for the transaction logs and\n\n206\n00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.090\njust in a mirror.\n\n207\n00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.740\nTransaction logs are generally small,\nit's the changes, and\n\n208\n00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.968\ntransaction logs are where\nyour writes are going to.\n\n209\n00:10:17.968 --> 00:10:21.951\nWhen you write to transaction logs,\nyou don't wanna calculate parity on it.\n\n210\n00:10:21.951 --> 00:10:25.411\nA mirror is easy, it just writes to\nthe two disks simultaneously, so\n\n211\n00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:27.093\nyou don't impact performance.\n\n212\n00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:31.140\nAnd then we took the remaining disks and\nwe set up a RAID 10 array.\n\n213\n00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.720\nWith RAID 10, you get striping\nperformance out of it, like RAID 5.\n\n214\n00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.680\nBut instead of calculating parity,\nyou're doing mirrors, and\n\n215\n00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.220\nmirrors are more efficient.\n\n216\n00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.650\nAnd so by doing all of these things,\nwe've lost a ton of storage.\n\n217\n00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.980\nA ton of storage that\nwasn't being used anyway.\n\n218\n00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:50.420\nAnd we resulted in storage that was far\nmore optimized and ran a lot more quickly,\n\n219\n00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.660\nand we didn't even have\nto add any disks to it.\n\n220\n00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:53.750\nAnd by the time we were done,\n\n221\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:58.280\nwe were able to run that query in that\nthree day operation, took one day.\n\n222\n00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.100\nIt still took 24 hours, I think it\nwas 26 hours when we were done, so\n\n223\n00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.960\nit still took 26 hours.\n\n224\n00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.620\nBut it was over twice as\nfast as what it used to be.\n\n225\n00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.570\nIt got done much faster and\nall we did was reconfigure the discs.\n\n226\n00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:13.290\nSo it pays to understand\nwhat your software needs and\n\n227\n00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.130\nprovide the appropriate hardware.\n\n228\n00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:19.280\n&gt;&gt; Don when you apply duplexing\nto your radar raids is that\n\n229\n00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.760\njust above full tolerance or does that\nlike pick up the performance a little bit\n\n230\n00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.780\nhaving more than one raid controller cart\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n231\n00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.490\nthat's really just about fault tolerance.\n\n232\n00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:32.260\nI've seen a number of systems where you\nhave more than one RAID controller and\n\n233\n00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.470\nthe thing is, you're sending the same\nset of instructions to each of them.\n\n234\n00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.250\nBecause otherwise,\n\n235\n00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.300\nif you're trying to divide it up like half\nthe instructions go to this controller and\n\n236\n00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.910\nhalf go to the other controller, it takes\ntime to divide those operations up.\n\n237\n00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.040\nSo if you want it to be in real-time,\n\n238\n00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.200\nyou gotta send the same\noperations to both of them.\n\n239\n00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.720\nAnd then the only difference is,\none of them is doing the writes and\n\n240\n00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.160\nthe other is just sitting on it and\nnot doing anything.\n\n241\n00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.800\nAnd only if the other adapter dies,\ndoes the other one kick in.\n\n242\n00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.860\nI have not seen one.\n\n243\n00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.810\nI am not saying they don't exist,\nI'm just saying I've never seen one\n\n244\n00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:03.185\nwhere they actually divide\nthe workload up efficiently, and\n\n245\n00:12:03.185 --> 00:12:05.725\nit's usually a performance thing.\n\n246\n00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:09.025\nAll right, enough about that, let's start\ntalking about the different roles and\n\n247\n00:12:09.025 --> 00:12:10.143\nhow they fall into this.\n\n248\n00:12:10.143 --> 00:12:13.185\nI kinda led off with databases just cuz\nwanted to give you guys an example of\n\n249\n00:12:13.185 --> 00:12:14.825\nhow we can improve performance.\n\n250\n00:12:14.825 --> 00:12:19.241\nBut you can also just save money, cuz\nsometimes we waste a lot of money when we\n\n251\n00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:22.423\nbuy hardware and try and\nset up some kind of a solution.\n\n252\n00:12:22.423 --> 00:12:25.337\nSo, for example,\nlets start off with web servers.\n\n253\n00:12:25.337 --> 00:12:27.230\nLet's think about what a web server does.\n\n254\n00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:31.550\nA web server contains web pages, and\nweb pages are really small, right?\n\n255\n00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:36.450\nHTML files are usually 14K,\nmaybe a massive page might be 20K,\n\n256\n00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:40.860\nin which images that might get stored,\nand your serving goes up via the network.\n\n257\n00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.790\nAnd so, when you look at a web server,\n\n258\n00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:47.290\nthings like Disk IO aren't\nusually a problem for us.\n\n259\n00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.180\nBecause the web pages are small enough\nthat the server will normally cache\n\n260\n00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.490\nthem into RAM.\n\n261\n00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.450\nAnd I know I said we're\ncaching into RAM but\n\n262\n00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:56.420\nRAM's not normally a problem\neither cuz how big your webpage?\n\n263\n00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:01.440\nIt's not typically very large, so\non a standard web server you don't need\n\n264\n00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.000\na lot of disk, you don't need\na lot of RAM to do their job.\n\n265\n00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.300\nBut you do need a lot of network.\n\n266\n00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.590\nYou need a lot of bandwidth.\n\n267\n00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.470\nWe need redundant bandwidth,\nand we need enough of it to be\n\n268\n00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.200\nable to match whatever our Internet\ntunnel happens to be, right.\n\n269\n00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.340\nSo if you have a T1 line,\nit's only 1.5 megabit.\n\n270\n00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:22.920\nBut if you have metro ethernet with\na gigabit line, then in theory,\n\n271\n00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.930\nyou could have a gigabit of web\ntraffic moving across that line.\n\n272\n00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.358\nAnd your web servers need\nto be able to handle that.\n\n273\n00:13:28.358 --> 00:13:31.031\nEither your individual web server or\nyour multiple web servers,\n\n274\n00:13:31.031 --> 00:13:33.714\nif you've got some kind of farm\nwith load balancing and all that.\n\n275\n00:13:33.714 --> 00:13:35.960\nYou need to make sure that\nyou can provide that level.\n\n276\n00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.610\nNetwork is really important.\n\n277\n00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.260\nSo taking this design\nhere from my template,\n\n278\n00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.260\nI'll want redundant network\nadapters in a web server.\n\n279\n00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.840\nI might be load balancing across\nthem to double my bandwidth but\n\n280\n00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.010\nI at least want two in case one fails,\nthe other one's still in there.\n\n281\n00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:52.620\nBut I probably don't need a ton of ram or\na ton of disk.\n\n282\n00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.190\nIn fact, on the disk side of things,\n\n283\n00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:59.760\nI might just do two drives and\na mirror, right?\n\n284\n00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.880\nBecause I can have\nthe operating system and\n\n285\n00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.870\nthe webpages right there on the same disk.\n\n286\n00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.430\nIt's getting cached into RAM.\n\n287\n00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.650\nI probably don't need a ton of RAM either,\nso I can cut that down a good bit,\n\n288\n00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:13.180\nbecause I just need to cache\nthe webpages and serve them up.\n\n289\n00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.070\nNow where things start to get\ntricky is on the CPU side, though.\n\n290\n00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:21.620\nIf these are static webpages,\nI can start dropping off CPU easy.\n\n291\n00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.750\nRight?\n\n292\n00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:28.517\nBut what if it's PHP, or\nsome kind of dynamic web format?\n\n293\n00:14:28.517 --> 00:14:33.430\nWith PHP, a user, whoever it is\nthat's accessing the system connects,\n\n294\n00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.920\nthey request the page, the PHP page, and\n\n295\n00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.780\nyour server has to dynamically create\nthe static page that user is gonna see.\n\n296\n00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:42.460\nAnd it changes.\n\n297\n00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.061\nThink about like Amazon.com.\n\n298\n00:14:45.061 --> 00:14:49.815\nIf you go to Amazon.com right now, you're\ngonna see a different webpage than I do.\n\n299\n00:14:49.815 --> 00:14:53.754\nI'm gonna see one that's gonna show\nitems that match my history and stuff\n\n300\n00:14:53.754 --> 00:14:58.218\nI might be interested in, you're gonna see\nstuff that you might be interested in.\n\n301\n00:14:58.218 --> 00:15:02.257\nSo unless you just happen to be shopping\nfor X-Files DVDs and double-sided tape,\n\n302\n00:15:02.257 --> 00:15:05.270\nyou're probably gonna need\ndifferent suggestions than me.\n\n303\n00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.610\nI don't know why those are two of\nthe things that popped into my head.\n\n304\n00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.050\nBut anyhow, so that's what's gonna come\nup, and that's dynamically generated.\n\n305\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.360\nA web server somewhere had to\ncreate that page just for me.\n\n306\n00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.580\nAnd it has to do that by utilizing CPU.\n\n307\n00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.935\nAnd I'm just one person.\n\n308\n00:15:19.935 --> 00:15:23.659\nThere's probably tens of thousands of\npeople hitting Amazon's page at any\n\n309\n00:15:23.659 --> 00:15:24.247\ngive time.\n\n310\n00:15:24.247 --> 00:15:26.450\nAnd they've got multiple servers\nall churning through it.\n\n311\n00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:30.090\nBut in those scenarios,\nwe might need to add a CPU back, or\n\n312\n00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:35.010\ntwo, to be able to get the load that we\nneed and accommodate for that, right?\n\n313\n00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:38.030\nSo, understand the nature\nof your web server.\n\n314\n00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:39.550\nIs it a dynamic web server?\n\n315\n00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:40.450\nIs it static?\n\n316\n00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:44.060\nIs it serving up a ton of files,\nor are they just text with images?\n\n317\n00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.970\nThat kind of stuff will\nimpact your hardware.\n\n318\n00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.102\nThe web servers typically don't need\na whole lot in the way of hardware.\n\n319\n00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:56.568\nAll right, the next one the CompTIA\nclose as an application server and\n\n320\n00:15:56.568 --> 00:16:01.383\napplication servers are tricky, because\nwhich application are we talking about?\n\n321\n00:16:01.383 --> 00:16:02.332\nRight?\n\n322\n00:16:02.332 --> 00:16:05.789\nThere's so many different applications\nthat are out there, and even custom\n\n323\n00:16:05.789 --> 00:16:09.830\napplications that you write in-house,\nand they all have very different needs.\n\n324\n00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.980\nWe have an application server\nhere that handles our videos.\n\n325\n00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.790\nSo when an episode like this is done,\nit's gotta go and it's gotta get encoded.\n\n326\n00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.370\nWe have to transcode it from\nthe format that we record in,\n\n327\n00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.350\ninto the format that you guys watch in.\n\n328\n00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:25.220\nAnd that is a heavy,\nheavy CPU intensive process.\n\n329\n00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:29.135\nBut there's other people who have\napplication servers that do document\n\n330\n00:16:29.135 --> 00:16:31.560\nimaging and so they're disk IO.\n\n331\n00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.530\nLots of disks.\n\n332\n00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.920\nThey need to store all these\nimages of documents and\n\n333\n00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.150\nneed to be able to retrieve those and\npull them back.\n\n334\n00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.070\nLots of disks, maybe a lot of RAM.\n\n335\n00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:40.390\nDifferent needs, right?\n\n336\n00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:43.950\nFor an application server, you've gotta\nfigure out what the application is.\n\n337\n00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:48.360\nAnd then whoever makes that application\nwill typically have a spec list for it.\n\n338\n00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:54.380\nSo if I'm gonna go out and deploy\nOracle's database server, for example,\n\n339\n00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:59.800\nOracle has a hardware recommendation\nlist that has all sorts of sizing data.\n\n340\n00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.680\nAll the Microsofts do.\n\n341\n00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.280\nIf I deploy a Microsoft Project Server,\nor a Microsoft Exchange Server,\n\n342\n00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.940\nwhatever, they've got sizing guides that\nhelp you to identify the right hardware\n\n343\n00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.720\nto provide that role or service.\n\n344\n00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.680\nSo application servers are a lot harder\nto nail down unless we know exactly which\n\n345\n00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.650\nthe application is.\n\n346\n00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:18.070\nAnd technically, a web server\nis an application server, right?\n\n347\n00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.450\nThe website is your\napplication these days.\n\n348\n00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.140\nBut an application could be anything.\n\n349\n00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.220\nAll right, a directory server.\n\n350\n00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.460\nNow a directory server, we're normally\ntalking about something like open LDAP or\n\n351\n00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.170\nMicrosoft Active Directory.\n\n352\n00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:33.820\nAnd a directory like that is a database.\n\n353\n00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.220\nAnd when we think databases,\n\n354\n00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:39.090\nthe first thing that pops into\nmy mind is disk storage, right?\n\n355\n00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:43.473\nThe difference here, though, is that while\na directory server is a database server,\n\n356\n00:17:43.473 --> 00:17:45.043\nit's not a very big database.\n\n357\n00:17:45.043 --> 00:17:48.623\nIf you have a Microsoft Active Directory\nserver with thousands of users,\n\n358\n00:17:48.623 --> 00:17:52.370\nyour database is probably only\n300 megabytes in size or so.\n\n359\n00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:56.179\nIf you start getting into\nthe hundreds of thousands of users,\n\n360\n00:17:56.179 --> 00:17:58.608\nmaybe you'll get to a gigabyte or two.\n\n361\n00:17:58.608 --> 00:18:01.990\nAnd in the database world,\nthat is just not a significant size.\n\n362\n00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.670\nSo if you're only talking about a couple\nof gigs in size for that database,\n\n363\n00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.650\non our disk side, we don't normally\nhave to come up with anything special,\n\n364\n00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.600\nwe can run with\nthe standard configuration.\n\n365\n00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.560\n&gt;&gt; Now I know directory servers also\ndo authentication too, as well, Don.\n\n366\n00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.350\nDoes the authentication process,\ndoes that bog down the server?\n\n367\n00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.840\nIf you have, let's say you're in a company\nthat has thousands of employees and\n\n368\n00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.500\nthey're logging in at 8 in the morning?\n\n369\n00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.020\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I mean, there's a lot\nof supplementary tasks that we perform.\n\n370\n00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.840\nSo just looking at that database,\nthey're doing queries off that, I mean,\n\n371\n00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.440\nwe don't have to plan for it very much.\n\n372\n00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.928\nBut authentication, right?\n\n373\n00:18:31.928 --> 00:18:35.874\nYou're doing Kerberos encryption and\nyou've gotta hash passwords, or\n\n374\n00:18:35.874 --> 00:18:38.110\nyou've kind of already got them hashed.\n\n375\n00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.890\nYou're comparing hashes,\nyou're encrypting data,\n\n376\n00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.190\ncuz you're doing all\nsecure communications.\n\n377\n00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.930\nIf we go back to web servers,\nif you're doing SSL on that web server or\n\n378\n00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:51.450\nTLS, then you're encrypting traffic there\ntoo, and that'll spike your CPU a bit.\n\n379\n00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.650\nOr if you have hardware that accounts for\nthat.\n\n380\n00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:57.250\nOn a directory server, there's other\nthings outside of authentication.\n\n381\n00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.900\nA lot of directory servers\nare time servers also.\n\n382\n00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.120\nThey're doing global catalog functions or\n\n383\n00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:07.290\nthey're summarizing this particular\ndirectory as well as other directories.\n\n384\n00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:11.048\nYou might have trust relationships with\nother directories that are out there.\n\n385\n00:19:11.048 --> 00:19:11.968\nIt's gotta manage those.\n\n386\n00:19:11.968 --> 00:19:16.428\nIt's a lot of supplementary activities\nthat do mostly impact CPU, but\n\n387\n00:19:16.428 --> 00:19:18.660\nsomewhat impact RAM also.\n\n388\n00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.040\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna ruin the vendor neutrality\nhere that you've been struggling so\n\n389\n00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.390\nhard on through this series.\n\n390\n00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.895\nHow about something where it's not\njust a single Active Directory,\n\n391\n00:19:26.895 --> 00:19:30.652\nwhere it's now since 2008 we've\nbeen integrating things like DNS.\n\n392\n00:19:30.652 --> 00:19:32.450\nAnd sometimes you even run DHCP.\n\n393\n00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:36.850\nWhen you start stacking those, and more to\nthe directory server more specifically,\n\n394\n00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:38.600\nwhen you start stacking\nsomething like that on,\n\n395\n00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.810\ncan you see an increase of the resources\nthat you need inside of, let's say,\n\n396\n00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.980\na traditional domain controller?\n\n397\n00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:49.850\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely, they start to,\nwell, let's talk about this.\n\n398\n00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.300\nBecause sometimes it's bad,\nsometimes it's good.\n\n399\n00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.430\nYou can have more than one role\nin the same server, right?\n\n400\n00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:57.210\nWhen you're reading the textbooks,\nthey say don't do it.\n\n401\n00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.390\nIt's all over the place,\nhey, don't mix the roles.\n\n402\n00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.700\nBut in real life,\nyou can mix the roles and\n\n403\n00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.390\na lot of times it works out really well.\n\n404\n00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.220\nBecause if you get to think\nabout the resource intensivity,\n\n405\n00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.500\nintensivity, is that a word?\n\n406\n00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.865\nI don't know how intensive\nthe resource acts with this.\n\n407\n00:20:08.865 --> 00:20:10.080\n&gt;&gt; It is now.\n\n408\n00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:10.930\n&gt;&gt; I'm making it a word.\n\n409\n00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:11.780\nThe intensivity.\n\n410\n00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.040\nI'm gonna use the and\nshow you how this works.\n\n411\n00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.360\nSo if you take something like\nthe Active Directory, right?\n\n412\n00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.360\nIt's a directory, it's a database.\n\n413\n00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.420\nAnd so there's a little bit of\ndisk access, but not much, right?\n\n414\n00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.390\nThere's gonna be some RAM utilization,\nbut not a ton.\n\n415\n00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.790\nThere's gonna be some network utilization,\nbut again not a ton.\n\n416\n00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:31.430\nMostly it's gonna be hitting on that CPU,\nright?\n\n417\n00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:36.071\nWell, what about another role,\na role like DHCP?\n\n418\n00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:39.746\nDHCP servers, they use the network\ncard a lot, a lot of broadcasts, but\n\n419\n00:20:39.746 --> 00:20:40.842\nthey're small.\n\n420\n00:20:40.842 --> 00:20:46.986\nIt's just the DORA process, the discover,\noffer, request, acknowledge?\n\n421\n00:20:46.986 --> 00:20:47.541\n&gt;&gt; You got it.\n\n422\n00:20:47.541 --> 00:20:48.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I passed, A plus.\n\n423\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:53.480\nSo the DORA process, it's four packets.\n\n424\n00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.847\nIt's just four little\npackets on the network.\n\n425\n00:20:55.847 --> 00:20:58.518\n1500 bytes tops, it would be\na Mac far smaller than that, so\n\n426\n00:20:58.518 --> 00:21:00.520\nyou're really not talking about much.\n\n427\n00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.160\nEven if you have tens of\nthousands of laptops,\n\n428\n00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.850\na DSP server is just not\ndoing a whole heck of a lot.\n\n429\n00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.660\nAnd the database is really small,\ntoo, cuz what's in the database?\n\n430\n00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.650\nMAC address, IP, lease time.\n\n431\n00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.220\nIt's super small.\n\n432\n00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.750\nA DHCP database will be a handful of\nmegabytes even on a large network.\n\n433\n00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.860\n&gt;&gt; And then those, yeah,\njump in here real quick, and\n\n434\n00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.370\nthen those leases, depending on how you\nset it up, they have them for a week.\n\n435\n00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:24.520\nSo then that computer doesn't\neven have to check in for a week.\n\n436\n00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.080\nSo let's say everybody's checked in,\nwhat's it doing?\n\n437\n00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.148\n&gt;&gt; Not much, right?\n\n438\n00:21:29.148 --> 00:21:32.880\nSo you are gonna have a little bit of\na RAM utilization, cuz it'll try and\n\n439\n00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.120\ncatch that database in the RAM, but\nagain, it's not a big database.\n\n440\n00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.530\nSo if I have a directory server and\na DHCP server, and\n\n441\n00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:43.000\nI put them on the same hardware,\nam I gonna be okay?\n\n442\n00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.830\nYeah, yeah, you are, right?\n\n443\n00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:47.950\nBecause they don't\ncontend with each other.\n\n444\n00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.520\nBut sometimes that doesn't work out.\n\n445\n00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.640\nLet's say I have a database server.\n\n446\n00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.310\nThe database is gonna thrash some disk IO,\nright?\n\n447\n00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:58.484\nIt's really gonna hit those disks,\nI mean, disk joining as best as possible.\n\n448\n00:21:58.484 --> 00:21:59.880\nAnd I have a file server.\n\n449\n00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.870\nThe file server is hitting network and\ndisk, right, doing the same thing.\n\n450\n00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.500\nIf I put those two on the same box,\nthe database server and\n\n451\n00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.680\nthe files that were both hitting the disk,\nwe get contention.\n\n452\n00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.800\nContention is when you have two\ndifferent services that are fighting for\n\n453\n00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.410\nthe same resource and\none has to wait on the other.\n\n454\n00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.410\nAnd things are gonna run slower\nthan if they were separate, right?\n\n455\n00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.860\nSo when you have contention for resources,\nyou need to separate things out.\n\n456\n00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:30.170\nBut when they're together,\nwhen they're not overlapping,\n\n457\n00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:34.500\nthat's when they can piece together,\n\n458\n00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.870\nthey can go on the same server and\nyou won't see any impact.\n\n459\n00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:40.700\nSo it's very common for someone to have a\ndirectory server that's also doing DNS and\n\n460\n00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.770\nDHCP cuz DNS is the same way.\n\n461\n00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.160\nYou got a database but it's small.\n\n462\n00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.660\nI mean, unless you're one of\nthe root servers on the Internet.\n\n463\n00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.050\nAnd even their databases aren't that big\ncuz they're really just pointing out to\n\n464\n00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:51.720\nthe other ones.\n\n465\n00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.220\nThe TLD servers are probably\nthe biggest ones, so\n\n466\n00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.380\nmaybe if you got a TLD server\nthen it's a different story.\n\n467\n00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.142\nBut most of us have very\nsmall DNS databases.\n\n468\n00:22:59.142 --> 00:23:02.580\nAnd small DHCP databases,\nin a small directory,\n\n469\n00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.610\nthey play really nice all on the same\nhardware if you wanna go that route.\n\n470\n00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:10.430\nNow the argument for not doing that\nis if I have a problem with one and\n\n471\n00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:15.360\nI wanna reboot or something,\nI affect the other services, right?\n\n472\n00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.780\nIf one crashes,\nit would take all three with it.\n\n473\n00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.885\nThat's bad, and that's where\nvirtualization comes in really handy.\n\n474\n00:23:20.885 --> 00:23:23.920\nWith virtualization,\nI can create virtual machines, so\n\n475\n00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.730\nif one crashes it just affects that one\nvirtual machine and not the others.\n\n476\n00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.389\nAnd I can take one down independently and\nnot mess with the others.\n\n477\n00:23:31.389 --> 00:23:33.768\nI can even move the virtual\nmachine to other hardware and\n\n478\n00:23:33.768 --> 00:23:36.670\nseparate them out if I need to\nif I start to see contention.\n\n479\n00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:37.790\nVirtualization helps with all that and\n\n480\n00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:40.280\nwe're gonna do a whole\nvirtualization episode coming up,\n\n481\n00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.770\nprobably two, but\nwe'll get to that a little bit later.\n\n482\n00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:47.260\nLet's see, I kind of jumped\naround on the list now, didn't I?\n\n483\n00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:47.956\nPrint server.\n\n484\n00:23:47.956 --> 00:23:51.516\nPrint server, or\nI guess file server and print server.\n\n485\n00:23:51.516 --> 00:23:54.590\nFile servers and print servers\nare actually very, very similar.\n\n486\n00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:57.257\nThe difference is kind of\nwhere the data comes from.\n\n487\n00:23:57.257 --> 00:24:00.401\nOn a file server, we normally put\nour data on the file server so\n\n488\n00:24:00.401 --> 00:24:03.433\nit's occupying a lot of disk space and\nthen we retrieve it.\n\n489\n00:24:03.433 --> 00:24:06.838\nAnd so as we retrieve it we're eating up\ndisk IO, and disk IO I'm talking about\n\n490\n00:24:06.838 --> 00:24:09.770\ninput and output, right,\nreads and writes on the disk.\n\n491\n00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.920\nAnd then we're eating up the network\nadapter cuz we're having to copy\n\n492\n00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.240\nthat data either to or from the server.\n\n493\n00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.340\nA print server's the same way.\n\n494\n00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.890\nYou create a print job and\nyou send it to the print server.\n\n495\n00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:22.574\nWell, print job is really just an image,\nit's like a big picture in a weird format.\n\n496\n00:24:22.574 --> 00:24:26.360\nAnd so it goes [LAUGH] to the server and\nit writes it to the hard drive.\n\n497\n00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.720\nAnd then it serves it to the printer and\n\n498\n00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.310\nwhen the job is done it deletes\nit from the hard drive.\n\n499\n00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:33.510\nIt's still a read and\nwrite operation just like a file server.\n\n500\n00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:36.828\nSo print servers and file servers\nare generally speced about the same.\n\n501\n00:24:36.828 --> 00:24:41.220\nYou're typically gonna have multiple\nhard drives to provide the best disc IO.\n\n502\n00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.320\nBut not a lot of CPU, not a lot of RAM,\nnot a lot of network.\n\n503\n00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.190\nWell, let me back up on that one,\n\n504\n00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:49.400\nyou need enough network to handle the load\nof the people that are accessing it.\n\n505\n00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.880\nAnd typically that can be pretty high.\n\n506\n00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.705\nYou might have a lot of people that\nare all accessing the disk at once.\n\n507\n00:24:54.705 --> 00:24:57.646\nAnd so you'll need some extra\nnetwork adapters probably bonded or\n\n508\n00:24:57.646 --> 00:24:59.920\nteamed together to provide that bandwidth.\n\n509\n00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.120\nThat's an important thing there too.\n\n510\n00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.430\n&gt;&gt; Don, speaking of a file server where\nyou need fast transfers and stuff.\n\n511\n00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:08.580\nWhen you attach it to something\nlike a fiber channel network,\n\n512\n00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.420\ndoes the fiber channel technology\nitself take the burden?\n\n513\n00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.980\nIs it not the server that's generally\ndoing the work at that point?\n\n514\n00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.310\nIs it the fiber channel technology\nthat's really doing the work?\n\n515\n00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:19.390\n&gt;&gt; Well, yes and no, right?\n\n516\n00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.790\nSo when you have a fiber channel SAN,\nright?\n\n517\n00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.020\nWhat you've got is an adapter.\n\n518\n00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:25.980\nIt looks like a network adapter,\n\n519\n00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.130\nit looks like a fiber optic network\nadapter that you pop into your server.\n\n520\n00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:30.960\nBut it doesn't show up\nas a network adapter,\n\n521\n00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.090\nit shows up as a hard drive controller.\n\n522\n00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:37.537\nAnd so your server is talking to that,\nit's a host bus adapter an HBA.\n\n523\n00:25:37.537 --> 00:25:41.780\nYou're talking to that fiber HBA just\nlike it was a RAID controller, right?\n\n524\n00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.540\nSo as far as the work our server\ndoes is exactly the same.\n\n525\n00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.680\nNow normally a RAID controller would then\ntake the burden of accessing the drives\n\n526\n00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.970\nfor us internally.\n\n527\n00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:52.750\nHere the HBA takes the responsibility for\nthat and\n\n528\n00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:54.670\nsends it across the fiber optic network.\n\n529\n00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:58.290\nAnd that fiber optic network may\nbe slower than your internal side.\n\n530\n00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.220\nSo on the internal side you might\nactually get better performance\n\n531\n00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.040\nout of it even though you're doing\ntechnically all of the work.\n\n532\n00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.250\nCuz it's really the controller\nthat's doing the work, not your CPU,\n\n533\n00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:07.650\nnot your RAM.\n\n534\n00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:10.120\nIt's the controller's CPU,\nthe controller's RAM.\n\n535\n00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.658\nA RAID controller really\nis its own little computer.\n\n536\n00:26:13.658 --> 00:26:18.518\nAnd an HBA is really just an interface\nthat's sending that data over to a SAN.\n\n537\n00:26:18.518 --> 00:26:20.590\nAnd the SAN is its own computer.\n\n538\n00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.550\nSo somebody's doing the work somewhere.\n\n539\n00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:27.037\nBut as far as your server performance\nyou probably won't see much difference.\n\n540\n00:26:27.037 --> 00:26:30.630\nAll right, messaging and mail servers.\n\n541\n00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.495\nMessaging servers they're\ntalking about chat, right.\n\n542\n00:26:33.495 --> 00:26:36.837\nSometimes they're talking about voice,\nbut usually they're talking about chat.\n\n543\n00:26:36.837 --> 00:26:41.795\nYou have a lot of services like Slack or\nIRC, instant messaging.\n\n544\n00:26:41.795 --> 00:26:45.005\nYou have private XMPP servers for\nmessaging, and they're chat.\n\n545\n00:26:45.005 --> 00:26:48.765\nThey're real time messages\nthat are sent between people.\n\n546\n00:26:48.765 --> 00:26:52.670\nMail servers are messaging also,\nbut it's not real time.\n\n547\n00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.490\nI might send an e-mail to Wes, and\n\n548\n00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:57.590\nit sits in his inbox and\nhe looks at it an hour later, right?\n\n549\n00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:01.050\nVersus a chat message I send to him he\nwould see right now as an immediate thing.\n\n550\n00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.380\nNow that's important to\nunderstand the difference.\n\n551\n00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:07.160\nThe immediateness of chat means\nit doesn't get written to a disk.\n\n552\n00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.510\nIt's done in RAM.\n\n553\n00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:11.250\nThe chat messages are sent, and\nit's stored in the RAM on the server.\n\n554\n00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.600\nIt's then sent to the client and then\nit's phased out on the RAM of the server,\n\n555\n00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.470\ncuz we don't save the chats.\n\n556\n00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:17.600\nSome systems do save the chats.\n\n557\n00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.200\n&gt;&gt; On that subject of messaging, we're\nseeing a lot more of this today for sure.\n\n558\n00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.850\nHow about something like a unified\ncommunication technology, right?\n\n559\n00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.660\nI know that's a lot of times is\nbroken up into many different parts,\n\n560\n00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.330\nbut you have servers, right,\nto perform that role as well.\n\n561\n00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:35.111\nAnd could that be something where you\ncould see messaging become more of\n\n562\n00:27:35.111 --> 00:27:36.047\na burden on the server?\n\n563\n00:27:36.047 --> 00:27:38.770\n&gt;&gt; So unifying communications you're\nreally talking about voice over IP.\n\n564\n00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:40.560\nYou're talking about phone lines, right.\n\n565\n00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.680\nAnd phone lines, the secret sauce for\n\n566\n00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.960\nvoice over IP is that in order for it to\nbe successful you have to create the same\n\n567\n00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:52.010\ncall quality level that you would\nhave on a physical phone line.\n\n568\n00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:56.950\nAnd technically a physical\nphone line only requires 9600\n\n569\n00:27:56.950 --> 00:28:01.834\nbytes of bandwidth and that's it, or 9.6k.\n\n570\n00:28:01.834 --> 00:28:05.340\nBut to guarantee that\non a regular network,\n\n571\n00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:09.430\nwhen we're doing digital communications,\nthey normally fire at about 64K.\n\n572\n00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:14.857\nSo 64 kilobits of bandwidth to have\na crystal clear voice quality call,\n\n573\n00:28:14.857 --> 00:28:17.929\nthat doesn't sound like a lot, does it?\n\n574\n00:28:17.929 --> 00:28:20.060\n64K, that's not a big deal.\n\n575\n00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.520\nWell, until you have 1,000 employees,\nright?\n\n576\n00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.030\nSo, now at 1,000 employees,\nI'm talking about 64 megabytes, right?\n\n577\n00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.710\nI'm talking about a much\nlarger amount of data.\n\n578\n00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.820\nAnd when we have that\nlarger amount of data,\n\n579\n00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.840\nwe need to guarantee that we've got it.\n\n580\n00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.770\nAnd if you're running a PBX, a.\n\n581\n00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.370\n&gt;&gt; Private branch exchange.\n\n582\n00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:39.500\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n583\n00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.140\nThe centralized phone server,\nyou need to be able to provide\n\n584\n00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:46.702\nall of those channels in real time\nwith as little latency as possible.\n\n585\n00:28:46.702 --> 00:28:50.810\nYou're gonna need multiple network\nadapters that are teamed, so\n\n586\n00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:53.120\nthat you can maintain the highest\nperformance possible.\n\n587\n00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.681\nWhen I say multiple, you will probably\nneed three or four, not just two.\n\n588\n00:28:56.681 --> 00:28:59.743\nBecause you need to make sure that even if\none link fails that you're still able to\n\n589\n00:28:59.743 --> 00:29:01.490\nmaintain your service levels, right.\n\n590\n00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:02.750\nYou are able to maintain that amount.\n\n591\n00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:05.710\nSo you're gonna need extra\nnetwork adapters for that.\n\n592\n00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:06.980\n&gt;&gt; Well, speaking of messaging.\n\n593\n00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.840\nHow about one of the most [LAUGH]\nimportant services we typically\n\n594\n00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.960\nhave within networks today,\nour email servers, right.\n\n595\n00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:17.740\nHow about SMTP, POP3, IMAP servers,\nwhat can we expect in those, Don?\n\n596\n00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:20.550\n&gt;&gt; Now,\nemail servers are a little bit trickier.\n\n597\n00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:23.360\nBecause we like to think\nof it as in real time, but\n\n598\n00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.620\non the email servers it\nstores all of your email.\n\n599\n00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.910\nAnd it stores it in a database.\n\n600\n00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:28.290\nIt doesn't matter what\nemail server you use.\n\n601\n00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:32.220\nIf you use Microsoft Exchange,\nNovell Groupwise, Sendmail,\n\n602\n00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:36.070\nany of those guys,\nthey all maintain a mail database.\n\n603\n00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:39.120\nWhich means you optimize it\njust like a database, right.\n\n604\n00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.440\nThat you've got database files that\nneed to get stored in the disk.\n\n605\n00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.060\nAnd they need to be optimized for\n\n606\n00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:47.790\nrandom reads that you're gonna be\nreading from all over that database.\n\n607\n00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:50.590\nCuz it might be Wes checking his mail\nright now, I might check my mail later.\n\n608\n00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.705\nAnd it might be stored in two\ndifferent places on the hard drive.\n\n609\n00:29:52.705 --> 00:29:54.910\nIt's gotta be able to jump around and\nfind those.\n\n610\n00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:59.240\nDisk IO is the key thing on an email\nserver, it's really important.\n\n611\n00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:02.308\nNow, you're gonna need a bit of CPU,\nyou're gonna need a good bit of RAM.\n\n612\n00:30:02.308 --> 00:30:05.470\nCuz it's gonna try and\ncache as much as it can into RAM.\n\n613\n00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:08.120\nAnd where it differs from a database\nserver, a traditional database server\n\n614\n00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.670\nyou're just sending queries to it and\ngetting simple answers.\n\n615\n00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:12.970\nWith an email server you're\nsending queries to it, but\n\n616\n00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:18.530\nthe response might be an email with ten\nmegs of picture attachments on it, right.\n\n617\n00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:22.930\nSo now we go to bandwidth, email\nservers can eat up a lot of bandwidth,\n\n618\n00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:24.385\ndatabase servers typically don't.\n\n619\n00:30:24.385 --> 00:30:29.260\nNow, there are some database servers like\nthe ones that power the mapping websites.\n\n620\n00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:33.960\nWhen you go to Google Maps or somewhere\nlike that and you pull up a cross section\n\n621\n00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.390\nof a map, that's not just a file they\nhad sitting on a hard drive somewhere.\n\n622\n00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:41.180\nIt's binary graphic data that\nwas stored in a database.\n\n623\n00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.530\nAnd you were served up\nthe coordinates that you chose,\n\n624\n00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:46.020\nqueried right out of the database.\n\n625\n00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:48.780\nAnd those things eat up\na huge amount of bandwidth.\n\n626\n00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:52.266\nBut most databases have text\nrecords in them, right?\n\n627\n00:30:52.266 --> 00:30:54.680\nWhen you go to the grocery store and\nyou're checking out and\n\n628\n00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.970\nthey scan your good and it looks it up and\nfinds the price and shows it up, right?\n\n629\n00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:03.620\nThey sent a query and they said, here's\na bar code I got, and it's 14 numbers.\n\n630\n00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:04.710\nWhat's the price?\n\n631\n00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.870\nAnd it returns the name of the product and\nthe price.\n\n632\n00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:11.210\nIt may be 30 to 40 characters of data,\nsuper small.\n\n633\n00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.920\nThat's what a normal database does.\n\n634\n00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.237\nAnd so those we don't worry\nabout the bandwidth so much.\n\n635\n00:31:15.237 --> 00:31:18.150\nBut on an email server,\nbandwidth is definitely a concern.\n\n636\n00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:20.180\n&gt;&gt; Here's another one that\nI'll throw at you, Don.\n\n637\n00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.170\nNow we've talked about a lot\nof the different servers.\n\n638\n00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:25.870\nI know that for my home network,\nI remote into it all the time.\n\n639\n00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:27.530\nIn fact, I use RDP and Windows just so\n\n640\n00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:31.245\nI can hide the fact of how much\nYouTube I watch here at ITProTV.\n\n641\n00:31:31.245 --> 00:31:31.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So for\n\n642\n00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:35.230\nme, as long as I have an Internet\nconnection, I'm just fine.\n\n643\n00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:36.590\nI can connect over the network.\n\n644\n00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.880\nI can make remote access\nback into my network.\n\n645\n00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.050\nWell, what if I'm a major company and\nwe've got, maybe, hundreds\n\n646\n00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:45.790\nof employees that need to gain access to\ntheir network and these type of servers.\n\n647\n00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:48.050\nI'm thinking your remote access servers.\n\n648\n00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:50.630\nCan you see some demand on those?\n\n649\n00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:51.690\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n650\n00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.954\nWhen we talk about remote access servers\nusually we're talking about VPNs, right.\n\n651\n00:31:54.954 --> 00:31:57.791\nSo you've got people that need\naccess to a remote network and\n\n652\n00:31:57.791 --> 00:31:59.022\nthey need secure access.\n\n653\n00:31:59.022 --> 00:32:02.718\nSo they build a VPN tunnel between\ntheir client, like my laptop And\n\n654\n00:32:02.718 --> 00:32:04.967\nwhoever they're trying to connect to.\n\n655\n00:32:04.967 --> 00:32:10.278\nWhen I'm at home I can VPN from my laptop\ninto the firewall here at the office.\n\n656\n00:32:10.278 --> 00:32:13.740\nAnd now I have access to the office\nnetwork even though I'm at home.\n\n657\n00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.670\nNow that works out great for me.\n\n658\n00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:17.935\nI get the access that I want,\nit's wonderful.\n\n659\n00:32:17.935 --> 00:32:19.655\nHere though, we're got the firewall.\n\n660\n00:32:19.655 --> 00:32:21.435\nAnd a firewall really is just a server.\n\n661\n00:32:21.435 --> 00:32:24.065\nAnd in fact, a lot of people do\njust take traditional servers and\n\n662\n00:32:24.065 --> 00:32:26.296\nload their firewall software\non their checkpoint.\n\n663\n00:32:26.296 --> 00:32:30.355\nCheckpoint Firewall One,\nthey made a whole living out of that.\n\n664\n00:32:30.355 --> 00:32:32.985\nTheir firewall product,\nyou can pick whatever server you want and\n\n665\n00:32:32.985 --> 00:32:34.395\nload their firewall on there.\n\n666\n00:32:34.395 --> 00:32:38.085\nOr there's virtualized firewalls\nnow thanks to VM ware and\n\n667\n00:32:38.085 --> 00:32:39.990\nother virtualization technologies.\n\n668\n00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:43.160\nThe thing to remember with these is\nthey're actually performing two options.\n\n669\n00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.490\nThere's the routing side and\nthere's the security side.\n\n670\n00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:50.970\nOn the routing side your data is going\nin one interface and going out another.\n\n671\n00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:53.920\nThey have two interfaces, one on the\ninside of the network, one on the outside.\n\n672\n00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.330\nThey're the gateway between\nthe outside world and\n\n673\n00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:57.960\nthe network you're trying to access.\n\n674\n00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:00.520\nThey're gonna need network bandwidth,\n\n675\n00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:06.250\nbecause every bit of traffic you send is\ngoing in and then out of that server.\n\n676\n00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:07.660\nIt's gonna have to have\nenough bandwidth for\n\n677\n00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.510\nyou and\neverybody else connected to that server.\n\n678\n00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:12.970\nThe amount of bandwidth is gonna vary\nbased on how many employees you have and\n\n679\n00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.690\nhow many simultaneous connections\nyou intend to maintain.\n\n680\n00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:17.410\nBut on a routing a remote access server,\n\n681\n00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:21.230\nyou're gonna need at least\nfour network adaptors.\n\n682\n00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:23.460\nTwo for the inside, teamed.\n\n683\n00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.400\nTwo for the outside, teamed.\n\n684\n00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:29.220\nThat way, if we have a failure, the link\nstays up and we get load balancing and\n\n685\n00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.750\nincreased bandwidth out of it.\n\n686\n00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.250\nYou might need more than four.\n\n687\n00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:36.100\nIf you have multiple networks and you're\ntrying to segregate that out, you could in\n\n688\n00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:41.930\ntheory do it with one adapter and\nhave a trunked VLAN type configuration.\n\n689\n00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:46.180\nBut you're gonna run into bandwidth\ncontention pretty quickly\n\n690\n00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.220\nbecause everybody is going\nin that interface and\n\n691\n00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.060\ncoming right back out the same\ninterface just on a different VLAN.\n\n692\n00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:54.710\nAnd so you're gonna be eating up\nthe full duplex nature of that line.\n\n693\n00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:56.080\nIf it's a half duplex line just give up.\n\n694\n00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:56.690\nIt's not going to work.\n\n695\n00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:59.390\nBut on a full duplex line like\na gigabit or a 10 gig line,\n\n696\n00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:04.795\nyou'll be consuming upload and download at\nan equal rate on a remote access server.\n\n697\n00:34:04.795 --> 00:34:08.970\n&gt;&gt; Don, I know the trend today is\na lot less physical stuff on site.\n\n698\n00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:10.460\nMore is going to the cloud.\n\n699\n00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.290\nWhile I know that we've got\ncoming up in the future,\n\n700\n00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:15.380\nwe've got some cloud episodes\nthat we'll be talking about.\n\n701\n00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:16.890\nHow much does this planning and\n\n702\n00:34:16.890 --> 00:34:21.630\nthis documentation can you really port\nthis over to the same considerations.\n\n703\n00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:23.430\nI know you have limited control of\nthe hardware in the cloud environment.\n\n704\n00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:24.680\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n705\n00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.570\n&gt;&gt; Documenting this so you know that hey,\nit's not physical anymore, but\n\n706\n00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:29.440\nin the cloud I can apply\nthese same techniques.\n\n707\n00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.590\n&gt;&gt; You certainly can and it's even more\nimportant because like with remote access\n\n708\n00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:34.790\nservers, I mentioned there's\ntwo things to think about.\n\n709\n00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:37.820\nThere's the bandwidth side, and\nwhen you go to a Cloud service, like AWS,\n\n710\n00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:38.820\nwhat do they tell you.\n\n711\n00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.600\nHey, bandwidth is unlimited,\nwe've got more bandwidth than anybody,\n\n712\n00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.520\nyou're welcome to all of it,\nand, they charge you, right?\n\n713\n00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:47.027\nSo, it's unlimited bandwidth,\nif you pay for it.\n\n714\n00:34:47.027 --> 00:34:49.835\n[LAUGH] And so\nthey never said it was free bandwidth.\n\n715\n00:34:49.835 --> 00:34:52.665\nYou do get free uploads into AWS.\n\n716\n00:34:52.665 --> 00:34:54.735\nThey charge you on the download,\non the way out.\n\n717\n00:34:54.735 --> 00:34:56.905\nSo, on a nice side,\nif you have a remote access server,\n\n718\n00:34:56.905 --> 00:34:58.725\nyou're only being charged for\none direction of that traffic, but\n\n719\n00:34:58.725 --> 00:35:02.402\nyou're paying 10cents per gigabyte for\nthat traffic or gigabyte.\n\n720\n00:35:02.402 --> 00:35:04.322\nYeah it is gigabyte,\nten cents per gigabyte.\n\n721\n00:35:05.952 --> 00:35:07.832\nThe prices may vary,\ndon't quote me on that.\n\n722\n00:35:07.832 --> 00:35:09.732\nI don't work for Amazon.\n\n723\n00:35:09.732 --> 00:35:11.172\nSo we have to think about that.\n\n724\n00:35:11.172 --> 00:35:16.212\nBut the other thing is, if we're doing a\nremote access server and it's a VPN, CPU.\n\n725\n00:35:16.212 --> 00:35:20.190\nThat server is having to encrypt and\ndecrypt traffic.\n\n726\n00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:22.800\nI'm sending it data,\nit's got to decrypt that.\n\n727\n00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.940\nIt's sending me data,\nit has to encrypt that to send it to me.\n\n728\n00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.680\nSo, that's a heavy CPU resource.\n\n729\n00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.370\nAnd CPU is not unlimited anywhere.\n\n730\n00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:36.450\nSo when you go to AWS and you bring up a\nfirewall, there's plenty of them on there,\n\n731\n00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:40.630\nCisco has an ASA image that you can\nspit up right as an Amazon AMI.\n\n732\n00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.388\nYou can bring them fully\nsupported by Cisco.\n\n733\n00:35:42.388 --> 00:35:45.360\nBut you gotta make sure you\nhave enough CPUs to power what\n\n734\n00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.580\nyou're gonna do with it.\n\n735\n00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.660\nWhen you buy a physical firewall,\n\n736\n00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:52.770\nit has special hardware on the motherboard\ndesigned for encryption and decryption.\n\n737\n00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:54.360\nIt's got acceleration for that.\n\n738\n00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.920\nWhen you go into the Cloud,\ndo you think you get that.\n\n739\n00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.804\nNo, you're using a virtualized processor.\n\n740\n00:35:58.804 --> 00:36:02.800\nAnd if it's virtualized,\nit has to do everything in software, and\n\n741\n00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.480\nthat's gonna hurt your performance.\n\n742\n00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.980\nNow, we are starting to see some virtual\nmachines being released that have\n\n743\n00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.830\nspecialized hardware\nthat isn't virtualized.\n\n744\n00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.120\nAmazon for example has ones\nwith graphic processors, GPUs.\n\n745\n00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.010\nIf you're building up a render farm,\n\n746\n00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:19.840\nyou might need some high-end\ngraphics cards in your servers.\n\n747\n00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.160\nWhen you go up to the cloud they've\ngot servers that have that.\n\n748\n00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.610\nAnd so you can take advantage of it but\n\n749\n00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:26.360\nthat hasn't carried over to all of\nthe other products that are out there.\n\n750\n00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:32.110\nSo we've got to make sure we understand\nwhat the needs of our product are so\n\n751\n00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:35.150\nthat when we spec out a cloud solution,\nwe can make sure that it matches up.\n\n752\n00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:37.000\nSo that is a key thing.\n\n753\n00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.520\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\n\n754\n00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:41.425\nwell that's a lot of considerations\nthat we need to consider apparently.\n\n755\n00:36:41.425 --> 00:36:42.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n756\n00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:44.990\nit does look like we're coming to\nthe end of another episode, Don.\n\n757\n00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:48.930\nBut before we do, do you got any\nadditional things you might wanna throw in\n\n758\n00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:51.490\nhere about the server roles,\nthe requirements, and\n\n759\n00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:54.360\neven the preparation when you're\ngonna deploy a new server.\n\n760\n00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.550\n&gt;&gt; Sure, at least one of you out there is\nprobably thinking Don Gray, you just told\n\n761\n00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:02.370\nme I need multiple processors or multiple\nhard drives but, how many do I need.\n\n762\n00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.130\nI didn't give you exact numbers..\n\n763\n00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:08.400\nAnd the reason is, there's no way I\ncan do that because I don't know how\n\n764\n00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.900\nmany users you have,\nhow much through put they generate.\n\n765\n00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.460\nI don't know what software\napplications you run.\n\n766\n00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.080\nI don't know enough information to\ngive you any kind of factual numbers.\n\n767\n00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.310\nSo any number I gave you\nwould likely be wrong.\n\n768\n00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:23.520\nSo understand that everything I just\nsaid are kind of high level guidelines.\n\n769\n00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.430\nYou've gotta examine your own\nsystems to spec that out right.\n\n770\n00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:32.190\nAnd then also know that even if you\ndo it 100 % correct right now and\n\n771\n00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:36.800\nyou have the most optimal solution it\nwill probably be wrong a year from now.\n\n772\n00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.590\nAnd the reason is you might\nspec out your database design\n\n773\n00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:45.470\nwhile your company has 200 employees and\nover the next year your company grows and\n\n774\n00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:49.710\nnow you have 300 employees and your\ndatabase isn't running optimally any more.\n\n775\n00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:52.260\nOr the size of the database just grows.\n\n776\n00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.910\nIt gets bigger and bigger that happens.\n\n777\n00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:56.120\nEmail servers you get more and\nmore accounts.\n\n778\n00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.710\nDirectory service,\nyou hire more employees.\n\n779\n00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:00.990\nWebsites, you get more and more customers.\n\n780\n00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:02.330\nIt changes the profile.\n\n781\n00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:05.510\nSo sizing your servers\nis not a one time job.\n\n782\n00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:07.720\nIt's an ongoing activity.\n\n783\n00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.600\nYou've always gotta be\npaying attention to it and\n\n784\n00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.680\nmaking sure your servers\nare performing optimally.\n\n785\n00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.850\nSometimes, you can make changes\nto an individual server without\n\n786\n00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:15.820\nbuying more hardware.\n\n787\n00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:19.240\nSometimes you can add just a few\npieces and gain that performance back.\n\n788\n00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.940\nOther times, it's time to upgrade and\nbuy a new server.\n\n789\n00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:24.820\nAnd you might look at it and say,\nI haven't even had this server a year.\n\n790\n00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.400\nWell, your company's grown.\n\n791\n00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:26.970\nThis is time.\n\n792\n00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:30.510\nYou need to scale out or scale up,\nwhatever it is you need to do\n\n793\n00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:34.050\nto make sure you maintain the performance\nand keep your system up and running.\n\n794\n00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:34.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don.\n\n795\n00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.520\nWell we appreciate having you here in\nthe studios, and we appreciate you,\n\n796\n00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.740\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n797\n00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.540\nSigning out

          "description": "In this episode, Wes and Don explore various technologies that are used to administer to a server. They talk about concepts like local hardware administration through KVMs,  serial console connections, as well as their limitations. They look at network-based hardware administration through components like KVM over IPs, ILOs and iDRACs with a demonstration of HPE ILOs. Finally, they will discuss network-based operating system administration through technologies like Microsoft Windows’s RDP, the widely popular SSH and VNC.",

00:00:14.610\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.135\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n5\n00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:21.140\nAnd in today's episode, we're continuing\nthrough our series in CompTIA server +.\n\n6\n00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.740\nGot our server operating system installed.\n\n7\n00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.730\nNow it's on to the adminstration part.\n\n8\n00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.460\nJoining us in the studios for\nthat is none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.600\nAnd Don, how you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.420\n&gt;&gt; Doing swell, Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.530\nReady to jump into a slightly\ndifferent area today.\n\n12\n00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.500\nWe're going to talk about how we\nadminister the servers once they're\n\n13\n00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.300\nalready in place.\n\n14\n00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.240\nWhen we've completed our installation,\nwe've racked them up.\n\n15\n00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.140\nAnd now we walk away, and\n\n16\n00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.580\nwe go into the day to day maintenance\nof keeping a server operational.\n\n17\n00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.490\nAnd the key thing to takeaway\nfrom this episode is we need some\n\n18\n00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.796\nway to watch the servers and there is\nmany, many different ways to do it.\n\n19\n00:00:53.796 --> 00:00:56.690\nSo we're going to run over\na few different ways that you\n\n20\n00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.740\ncan use to basically reach out and\nadminister these servers.\n\n21\n00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.860\nBut you're not going to do all of them,\nright.\n\n22\n00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.530\nIf you take the look of\nthis list that we cover and\n\n23\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.538\nsummon with you all those you're crazy,\nright.\n\n24\n00:01:06.538 --> 00:01:09.930\nWe got to pick the ones that match\nwith your administrations style and\n\n25\n00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.080\nyour budget because most of all\nwe're about talk about cost money.\n\n26\n00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.780\nSo it will add up pretty\nquick as you add more and\n\n27\n00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.060\nmore services some of it is free I guess.\n\n28\n00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.410\nAll right.\n\n29\n00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.850\nFirst off, when you deploy a server,\n\n30\n00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.750\nthe odds are you are not going to\nwork in the same room as the servers.\n\n31\n00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.530\nYou'll notice like for\n\n32\n00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.460\nus, our server room which is\nadmittedly a small one is very loud.\n\n33\n00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.950\nIt's also very cold.\n\n34\n00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.450\nAnd if I were in there every single day,\n\n35\n00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.360\nweek after week, It would be a really\nhostile work environment, right?\n\n36\n00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.080\nIt's just, it's cold, first off.\n\n37\n00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.160\nSo you gotta bundle up\nwhile you're in there.\n\n38\n00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.630\nAnd then secondly, it's so loud.\n\n39\n00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.270\nThe amount of noise that the fans make\nin all the different servers, and sand,\n\n40\n00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.790\nand all those other things\nthat it's just loud.\n\n41\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.910\nYou can't have a conversation in there.\n\n42\n00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.820\nImagine if it was a full-size data center,\nright.\n\n43\n00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.110\nWe have three racks,\nfour racks in a single row.\n\n44\n00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.425\nIf we had 100 racks spread across 20 rows,\nthat really get loud.\n\n45\n00:02:10.425 --> 00:02:15.275\nIt gets, it's just a really daunting\ntask trying to work in that environment.\n\n46\n00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:18.315\nThe other thing is we normally\nhave subfloor in a data center.\n\n47\n00:02:18.315 --> 00:02:21.415\nAnd subfloor are metallic plates that\nare elevated up off the ground so\n\n48\n00:02:21.415 --> 00:02:23.045\nyou can run cable underneath them.\n\n49\n00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:24.535\nIt's great.\nIt sounds really nice.\n\n50\n00:02:24.535 --> 00:02:27.325\nYou can blow air conditioning under\nthe floor and have it come up\n\n51\n00:02:27.325 --> 00:02:30.895\ninto the server racks, which is\nreally great too because heat rises.\n\n52\n00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:33.360\nSo you got the cold air\npushing the heat right out,\n\n53\n00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.860\nit's perfect, except it means that we\nhave to stand on metal plates all day.\n\n54\n00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.260\nAnd if you've ever done that, you're\ncalves will hurt by the end of the day, so\n\n55\n00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.458\nyou don't wanna be in the server room.\n\n56\n00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:47.690\nYou want to be in your office, sitting\nin your chair, sitting at your desk and\n\n57\n00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.780\nable to work on the server remotely.\n\n58\n00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.740\nWe need a way to administer our servers\nwithout actually being right by them.\n\n59\n00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.930\nAnd that's why in the episode where\nwe covered the server hardware,\n\n60\n00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.080\nI had that server right here\non the desk between Wes and I.\n\n61\n00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.130\nBut when it came time to turn it on and\n\n62\n00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.910\ninstall the OS, we took it out of\nthe studio, because it's just too loud\n\n63\n00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.910\nit makes our microphones not work,\nthat's how loud these things get.\n\n64\n00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.420\nSo how can we do that?\n\n65\n00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.570\nHow can we administrator it.\n\n66\n00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.990\nI know this the old fashion,\nwhich says screw it.\n\n67\n00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.410\nI'm going to go sit in\nthere in the servers.\n\n68\n00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.100\nAnd I can take a keyboard and a mouse,\nand I can plug it right into the server.\n\n69\n00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.830\nAnd I can take a monitor and\nhook it up to the server and,\n\n70\n00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.680\nthere we go I can manage it,\nI can administer it right there.\n\n71\n00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.670\nAnd then I can go to my office,\n\n72\n00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.100\nand whenever I want to do\nsomething on the server I get up,\n\n73\n00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.520\nwalk over to the server room sit down and\nwork on it.\n\n74\n00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.570\nAll right, that's fine.\n\n75\n00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.430\nYou can certainly do that.\n\n76\n00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.270\nThere's going to be two main challenges.\n\n77\n00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.220\nChallenge number one, the server room's\nnot always in the same building as you.\n\n78\n00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.190\nIt might be in a different building.\n\n79\n00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.550\nIt might be in a different state,\na different country.\n\n80\n00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.030\nIt could be across the world.\n\n81\n00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.330\nIt could be cloud servers, whatever.\n\n82\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.050\nNow, plugging in a keyboard,\nmouse isn't so viable anymore.\n\n83\n00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.070\nThe second thing is,\nwhen we have to get up and\n\n84\n00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.160\ngo in there, and\nthen hook up a monitor, all that.\n\n85\n00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.970\nHow many servers do we have?\n\n86\n00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.890\nIf you have hundreds of servers, you're\nnot going to have hundreds of keyboards\n\n87\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.780\nand mice dangling out of your server\nbecause you don't have enough room for it.\n\n88\n00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.664\nSo, you've got to have some way to share\nthat equipment between the systems.\n\n89\n00:04:10.664 --> 00:04:14.070\nAnd so that kind of makes\nit not something we can do.\n\n90\n00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.840\nYou can't share one USB device\nwith multiple systems, can you?\n\n91\n00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.990\nNot normally.\n\n92\n00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.720\nBut there are devices called KVMs.\n\n93\n00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.390\nKVM stands for keyboard video monitor.\n\n94\n00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.630\nAnd it's a device that\nlets you share a monitor.\n\n95\n00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.630\nWell, a keyboard and a mouse,\n\n96\n00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.950\nthat's the name, it lets you share those\nthree devices amongst many systems.\n\n97\n00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.560\nNow I've set these up for\nyears and originally they were\n\n98\n00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.590\nletting you share a PS2 keyboard,\na PS2 mouse, and a VGA monitor.\n\n99\n00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.390\nNewer ones, do USB, because most\nkeyboards and mice do USB these days and\n\n100\n00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.330\nmost servers have USB on them.\n\n101\n00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.610\nBut on the video side,\nwe're still VGA for most of it.\n\n102\n00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.670\nServers really didn't make\nthe jump to DVI or HDMI or\n\n103\n00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.090\nanything, because they don't need it.\n\n104\n00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.400\nServers, we don't care about graphics.\n\n105\n00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.320\nYou're not playing video\ngames on your server.\n\n106\n00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.890\nSo it's okay to have something that\njust a VGA connection, doesn't matter.\n\n107\n00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.330\nBut we would have a KVM\n\n108\n00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.640\nthat would then have cables that\nwould run to all the servers.\n\n109\n00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.420\nSo if I had 20 servers,\nI'd get a KVM that had at least 20 ports.\n\n110\n00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.890\nProbably 24 ports is where it would be.\n\n111\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.040\nAnd I would run cables to every\nsingle server from that KVM.\n\n112\n00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.750\nAnd once they were hooked up,\nI can then take a keyboard, a monitor, and\n\n113\n00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.240\na mouse, and hook them up to the KVM.\n\n114\n00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.330\nAnd from that box, you can manipulate\nbuttons right on the front of it to say,\n\n115\n00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.750\nshow me server number 20.\n\n116\n00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.260\nShow me server number 15.\n\n117\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.930\nShow me server number 11.\n\n118\n00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.860\nAnd by doing that, you would see\nthe actual video output of that server.\n\n119\n00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.460\nThat works perfect because\nyou could see the BIOS.\n\n120\n00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.080\nYou could see the RAID controller,\nthe network boot.\n\n121\n00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.840\nYou could see all that stuff.\n\n122\n00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.590\nAnd it didn't require any\nspecial software on the server.\n\n123\n00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.230\nThe server just thought\nit was a regular monitor.\n\n124\n00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.140\nThose solutions were great,\nexcept for the cabling.\n\n125\n00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.730\nThe cabling was a real pain\nin having to run all this.\n\n126\n00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.340\nAnd so, modern KVMs don't do that anymore,\n\n127\n00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.560\nthey don't use cables\nthe way they used to.\n\n128\n00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.300\nInstead most modern KVMs\nare what are called IPKVMs.\n\n129\n00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.380\nAnd let me show you a picture.\n\n130\n00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.530\nThis is a company called Blackbox.\n\n131\n00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.990\nThere are several different KVM\nvendors that are out there, Blackbox,\n\n132\n00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.260\nAverson, which I think it was\nbought by another company.\n\n133\n00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.660\nBut there's a bunch of different ones, and\nthe products are by and large the same.\n\n134\n00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.831\nAnd there's high quality ones,\nand low quality ones,\n\n135\n00:06:26.831 --> 00:06:29.430\nthose like Belkin ones that are cheap and\naren't build very well.\n\n136\n00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.440\nThe Avocent ones are expensive and\nthey're built really well.\n\n137\n00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.810\nThere's open source ones where\nthey have open source hardware,\n\n138\n00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.240\nOpengear makes some of those.\n\n139\n00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.100\nBut they all kind of work the same.\n\n140\n00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.600\nMost of them have switched to an IP model,\nwhere you have a KVM\n\n141\n00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.320\nswitch which is a box that you plug\na monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse into.\n\n142\n00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.430\nAnd you plug a network cable into it and\nthat's it.\n\n143\n00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.060\nYou don't plug anything else into it.\n\n144\n00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.960\nAnd then at all of your servers,\nyou have a little dongle.\n\n145\n00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.040\nAnd the little dongle\nplugs in one USB port,\n\n146\n00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.670\nwhich is doing mouse and\nkeyboard, and VGA.\n\n147\n00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.210\nYou plug these two wires in.\n\n148\n00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.860\nAnd then you plug\na network cable into that.\n\n149\n00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.400\nAnd so it's done through your network.\n\n150\n00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.790\nThat means we don't have to run a bunch\nof individual cables to all the servers,\n\n151\n00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.800\nwe just need to plug them\nin to their local switch.\n\n152\n00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.290\nAnd we can have one KVM That\npowers hundreds of devices.\n\n153\n00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.070\nWhen I had to plug a VGA cable in for\n\n154\n00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.760\neach server can you imagine 100\nVGA ports all next to each other?\n\n155\n00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.340\nYou can't physically fit it in the 19\ninches that we have in a rack.\n\n156\n00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.090\nSo you'd have to buy more than one KVM and\ndaisy chain them, and it was a pain.\n\n157\n00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.600\nWell IP KVMs make that a lot easier.\n\n158\n00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.420\nAnd the other cool thing about an IP KVM\nis its IP, it's on the network.\n\n159\n00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.250\nSo the KVM could actually\nbe in your office and\n\n160\n00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.330\nthen all the dongles around\nthe servers in the server room.\n\n161\n00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.720\nSo I could be sitting right in my office\nand still access the console of every one\n\n162\n00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.200\nof the machines that I need to\nwithout going in the server room.\n\n163\n00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.786\nNow, IP KVMs don't do such a great\njob stretching geographically.\n\n164\n00:07:56.786 --> 00:07:58.948\nSo, if I'm at home and\nI want to view all these things,\n\n165\n00:07:58.948 --> 00:08:00.739\nthey don't usually do\na great job with that.\n\n166\n00:08:00.739 --> 00:08:02.829\nSome of them do have remote\ngateways that you can setup so\n\n167\n00:08:02.829 --> 00:08:04.346\nyou've got remote access IP gateways.\n\n168\n00:08:04.346 --> 00:08:07.382\nAn extra appliance that\nhelps to optimize it.\n\n169\n00:08:07.382 --> 00:08:09.691\nCuz we're usually looking\nat the raw video,\n\n170\n00:08:09.691 --> 00:08:13.040\nand raw video is pretty intense\nas far as bandwidth, right?\n\n171\n00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.880\nAnd it's expecting very, very low latency.\n\n172\n00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.700\nBut when you start going\nout across the Internet,\n\n173\n00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.390\nyou're gonna have latency,\nyou can't push high video.\n\n174\n00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.970\nAnd so they use these gateways to\nbasically downscale the video and\n\n175\n00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.380\nmake the quality a little lower so\n\n176\n00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.950\nit streams easier, and it takes care\nof the delay that's introduced.\n\n177\n00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.210\nBut those are some of the options,\nand this is just one vendor.\n\n178\n00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:32.902\nBut like I said,\n\n179\n00:08:32.902 --> 00:08:36.269\nthere's plenty of vendors that are out\nthere that make KVMs like these, right?\n\n180\n00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:39.519\nKVMs are a really useful way\nof administering your server,\n\n181\n00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:42.317\nbecause you don't have to\ngo into the server room.\n\n182\n00:08:42.317 --> 00:08:46.508\nNow not every device we deploy is gonna\nhave video output, or a keyboard or\n\n183\n00:08:46.508 --> 00:08:48.270\nmouse for that matter.\n\n184\n00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.750\nThere's several devices that\nwe get that are appliances.\n\n185\n00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:57.420\nSo for example, we had a Barracuda Spam\nand Anti-virus Firewall, right?\n\n186\n00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.270\nYou couldn't hook a monitor up to it.\n\n187\n00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:03.830\nInstead it had a serial port, you plugged\nin via serial port to get your output.\n\n188\n00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.340\nAny Linux server can have its output\nredirect to a serial port, so\n\n189\n00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.020\nnow you don't need a keyboard or mouse,\nyou just need serial connectivity.\n\n190\n00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.250\nAnd the idea is if you wanted to\nadminister the server, you'd take a laptop\n\n191\n00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.640\nand you'd run a serial cable and plug it\ninto that device, and there you'd go.\n\n192\n00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.580\nYou could see everything you needed,\nright?\n\n193\n00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.940\nCisco routers, switches,\nmost vendor's routers and switches,\n\n194\n00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.950\ntheir firewalls, have a console\nport on them that is serial based.\n\n195\n00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.200\nOn a positive side, all you need is a\nserial cable and you can manage it, right?\n\n196\n00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.470\nIt's not so bad.\n\n197\n00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:36.510\nOn a negative side, there's not really\na great way to do that remotely, right,\n\n198\n00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.510\nat least the way that it is.\n\n199\n00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.210\nYou're kind of limited to the length of\na serial cable, which is not very long.\n\n200\n00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:46.440\nWell, fortunately, we have the equivalent\nof KVMs for serial connectivity.\n\n201\n00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.200\nYou can get what are called\nconsole servers, and\n\n202\n00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.830\nthere's a number of companies that\nmake them, there's open source ones.\n\n203\n00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.010\nI like the ones from\na company called Opengear.\n\n204\n00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.410\nThe Opengear is where they\nrelease all the blueprints for\n\n205\n00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.332\ntheir hardware as open source,\nso anybody can really make it.\n\n206\n00:10:00.332 --> 00:10:02.260\nBut then they just happen to make it and\nsell it too.\n\n207\n00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.420\nSo this is an example of one\nof their console servers.\n\n208\n00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.120\nAnd what you'll see is, you buy it\nbased on how many ports you need.\n\n209\n00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.670\nAnd so you need a 96 port,\nor a 48 port, 16 port.\n\n210\n00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.870\nYou buy the appropriate one, and\n\n211\n00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:20.460\nthen you run serial cables from this to\neach of the devices in that data center.\n\n212\n00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.060\nAnd then you can be anywhere in the world,\nand\n\n213\n00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.010\nwhen you remotely connect\nin to this console,\n\n214\n00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:30.320\nyou can then see the actual serial console\nof all the devices in the back end.\n\n215\n00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.855\nSo just to lay us out as an example,\nI used to work for a bank.\n\n216\n00:10:33.855 --> 00:10:38.280\nAnd our home office was up\nin Seattle Washington, and\n\n217\n00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.100\nwe had a Disaster Recovery Center\nthat was out in Spokane, Washington.\n\n218\n00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.860\nOn the other side of the state,\non the other side of the mountains.\n\n219\n00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.780\nWell, I think I went to the DR\nsite maybe twice, tops.\n\n220\n00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.940\nYou never went out there.\n\n221\n00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.680\nInstead you'd be sitting right at the home\noffice, and you'd pull up the IP KVM so\n\n222\n00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.440\nyou could view the Windows consoles or\nthe Linux consoles, and\n\n223\n00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.300\nthen you'd pull up the console server to\nbe able to view the firewalls and routers.\n\n224\n00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.960\nYou could manage every server as\nif you were sitting right there.\n\n225\n00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.610\nYou could power it down and power it on.\n\n226\n00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.270\nYou could install an operating system.\n\n227\n00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.573\nYou could do a full upgrade and not worry\nabout if you locked up the server, or\n\n228\n00:11:16.573 --> 00:11:19.980\nlocked yourself out,\ncuz you've got console access.\n\n229\n00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.680\nIt's as if you were standing\nright in front of it.\n\n230\n00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.520\nThe only thing you can't\ndo is put a CD in the tray.\n\n231\n00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.890\nBut you can always call somebody and\nhave them do that for you, right,\n\n232\n00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.810\nif there's at least one person\nout there at that location.\n\n233\n00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.960\nSo that's the advantage of having\nremote access technologies like these.\n\n234\n00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.740\nThe only negative is the hardware, right?\n\n235\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.510\nI've gotta buy a console server,\nI've gotta buy a KVM switch.\n\n236\n00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:43.729\nI've gotta buy dongles for\nall of my stuff to plug into their ports,\n\n237\n00:11:43.729 --> 00:11:46.261\ntheir video, and mouse, or whatever.\n\n238\n00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:50.271\nIt is expensive,\nyou have to pay a lot for this, right?\n\n239\n00:11:50.271 --> 00:11:54.429\nIf we just wanna monitor the servers\nwhile they're running normally, well,\n\n240\n00:11:54.429 --> 00:11:56.150\nwe can use software.\n\n241\n00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.310\nWe can use software to remotely\nconnect to these systems.\n\n242\n00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:03.825\nThe firewalls, and routers, and stuff\nthat have serial ports that I mentioned,\n\n243\n00:12:03.825 --> 00:12:05.230\nI can use SSH or telnet.\n\n244\n00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:09.960\nI could use protocols like that to\nremotely connect in and work with them.\n\n245\n00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.500\nWork just fine, right?\n\n246\n00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.975\nYou can connect in and access the device.\n\n247\n00:12:13.975 --> 00:12:17.364\nA lot of them have web interfaces, so\nI could fire up a web browser, and\n\n248\n00:12:17.364 --> 00:12:20.714\npoint it to it, and manage it that way,\nas long as they're working.\n\n249\n00:12:20.714 --> 00:12:22.794\nIt's when they're not working,\nwhen something goes wrong.\n\n250\n00:12:22.794 --> 00:12:25.591\nYou do a software update and\nit says, we're rebooting,\n\n251\n00:12:25.591 --> 00:12:30.430\nwe'll be back up in 60 seconds, and it's\nbeen 5 minutes and you still can't get in.\n\n252\n00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:31.930\nWhat the heck is going on?\n\n253\n00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:36.300\nI need to see what's on the screen, and\nthat's where these devices come in handy.\n\n254\n00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.150\nSo for a small office or a home office\nyou might not worry about this, but\n\n255\n00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.600\nin an enterprise,\nthis is really, really handy.\n\n256\n00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.740\n&gt;&gt; Don, I'm thinking of\na man-in-the-middle attack, or\n\n257\n00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:50.930\nan eavesdropping attack if you have\na remote IP-based KVM like that.\n\n258\n00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.780\nWhat are doing when it comes to security?\n\n259\n00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.160\nYou mentioned things like SSH,\nif I connect,\n\n260\n00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.750\nwe know that that's gonna be encrypted.\n\n261\n00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:00.600\nHow about these consoles\nwhen I connect to them?\n\n262\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.020\nCould I perform a man-in-the-middle\nattack between you and your server?\n\n263\n00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.478\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's always possible, right,\nespecially if you've misconfigured it.\n\n264\n00:13:07.478 --> 00:13:10.504\nBut if you take your time and\ndesign your solution right,\n\n265\n00:13:10.504 --> 00:13:12.217\nit can actually be more secure.\n\n266\n00:13:12.217 --> 00:13:17.284\nSo for example, we had this one little,\nthey were CSU/DSUs.\n\n267\n00:13:17.284 --> 00:13:21.650\nWe have several T1 lines, and\nthe CSU/DSUs supported network management.\n\n268\n00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:23.800\nIf you plugged a network cable into them,\nyou could manage it right there.\n\n269\n00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.200\nWe could actually pull statistics off of\nthe Telco lines right from these boxes,\n\n270\n00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.110\nit was really cool, but\nit only supported Telnet, that's it.\n\n271\n00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.600\nNope, no SSH, just Telnet.\n\n272\n00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.300\nAnd so at first I looked at it and\nI'm like,\n\n273\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.730\nwell there's a feature\nwe're not gonna use.\n\n274\n00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.930\nI'm not gonna enable Telnet cuz it's,\nwell, it's unencrypted, right?\n\n275\n00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.980\nBut then when we got the Opengear\nbox we put that console in,\n\n276\n00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.596\nit actually had where you\ncould run that to the CSU.\n\n277\n00:13:49.596 --> 00:13:56.580\nAnd so yeah, that was an encrypted line,\nbut you could SSH to the Opengear box.\n\n278\n00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.400\nSo now, across the Internet,\nor across the public networks,\n\n279\n00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.260\nI'm doing an encrypted SSH tunnel.\n\n280\n00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.940\nAnd on the backend it's unencrypted, but\n\n281\n00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.940\nthat's not crossing the Internet,\nthat's crossing just the data center line.\n\n282\n00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.850\nAnd if somebody's in the data center, then\nthey can unplug that cable and plug in\n\n283\n00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.970\ntheir own laptop anyway, so it doesn't\nreally matter at that point, right?\n\n284\n00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.800\nWe're kind of beyond that level\nof security at that point.\n\n285\n00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.110\nSo you can actually increase your security\nby deploying something like this,\n\n286\n00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:23.650\nright, that's one of the ways.\n\n287\n00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:24.980\nNow I could have misconfigured.\n\n288\n00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.909\nI could have said, you know what, let me\nenable telnet on the OpenGear box, and\n\n289\n00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:30.640\nthen I'm not any better off than\nI would have been before, right?\n\n290\n00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.680\nSo always keep that in mind,\nwhen you design a solution,\n\n291\n00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.230\nyou are the one who controls\nwhether it's secure or not.\n\n292\n00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:40.159\nAnd if you make the wrong decisions,\nyou likely will end up unsecure.\n\n293\n00:14:40.159 --> 00:14:43.594\n&gt;&gt; One of the things you'd mentioned,\nDon, is for instance if we got SSH.\n\n294\n00:14:43.594 --> 00:14:44.690\nIf the server's on, that's great.\n\n295\n00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.550\nI can connect to it,\nI can configure it through SSH.\n\n296\n00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:50.860\nWhat happens if the server is turned off,\nor it reboots, and\n\n297\n00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.405\nmaybe it didn't come back online?\n\n298\n00:14:52.405 --> 00:14:55.945\nAnd now don't have access\nto a live IP-based network,\n\n299\n00:14:55.945 --> 00:14:57.005\nbecause your server is turned off.\n\n300\n00:14:57.005 --> 00:14:58.160\nDo we have a solution then?\n\n301\n00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.290\n&gt;&gt; Man, there is so much great stuff\nwhen it comes data center management.\n\n302\n00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:05.255\nIf you ever get bored, go to APC's\nwebsite, APC, American Power Company.\n\n303\n00:15:05.255 --> 00:15:09.865\nThey're known for creating UPSs,\nUninterruptible Power Supplies, but\n\n304\n00:15:09.865 --> 00:15:11.005\nthey make a lot of other stuff.\n\n305\n00:15:11.005 --> 00:15:14.470\nThey make server racks, and\nthis whole infrastructure X line.\n\n306\n00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:18.660\nAnd they make these power strips that have\na network cable you plug into them, and\n\n307\n00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:22.840\nyou can remote in and\nturn each socket on and off independently.\n\n308\n00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.580\nYou can actually say, you know what,\nthis server is locked up so\n\n309\n00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.920\nI'm gonna cut power to it, and\nthen I'm gonna give it power again.\n\n310\n00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.440\nAnd so you can do that, you can control\nit right from the power outlet.\n\n311\n00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:37.450\nBut even if you don't have that,\na lot of server manufacturers are actually\n\n312\n00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:41.388\nintegrating that type of support\nright into the server itself.\n\n313\n00:15:41.388 --> 00:15:45.710\nAnd I kinda want it to be something we\ncovered in this episode, but I kinda let\n\n314\n00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.302\nthe cat out of the bag a few episodes\nago because I used it on our server.\n\n315\n00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:54.584\nDell and HP both have these integrated\nremote management boards that are right\n\n316\n00:15:54.584 --> 00:15:59.238\non the motherboard of the server, or\na card that's added right onto it.\n\n317\n00:15:59.238 --> 00:16:02.651\nWell they basically build\nan entirely separate computer.\n\n318\n00:16:02.651 --> 00:16:08.681\nIt's got its own CPU, its own memory, its\nown storage, But it's tied to your server.\n\n319\n00:16:08.681 --> 00:16:13.150\nOn the Dell ones, they call it\na Integrated Dell Remote Access Card, or\n\n320\n00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.677\nIDRAC.\n\n321\n00:16:13.677 --> 00:16:19.223\nAnd in HP world, it's an integrated\nLights Out Board, or ILO board.\n\n322\n00:16:19.223 --> 00:16:21.606\nAnd with ILO or IDRAC, either one,\n\n323\n00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:26.750\nyou can connect this other computer\nthat's inside of the server.\n\n324\n00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:30.658\nAnd even if the server is powered off,\nas long as the power cable is plugged in,\n\n325\n00:16:30.658 --> 00:16:32.568\nthis other computer will be running.\n\n326\n00:16:32.568 --> 00:16:35.389\nAnd you can connect in and\nstart to work with it.\n\n327\n00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:40.275\nThen from there, you don't worry\nabout things like KVM because you can\n\n328\n00:16:40.275 --> 00:16:42.810\nconnect right into the screen here.\n\n329\n00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:43.860\nAnd you don't even need the KDM.\n\n330\n00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.690\nWe don't need the extra cables or\nwhatever.\n\n331\n00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.108\nIt's built-in to the server.\n\n332\n00:16:47.108 --> 00:16:48.837\nSo just to show you an example of that,\n\n333\n00:16:48.837 --> 00:16:51.900\nthe server that we had on the desk\nhere in the other episode.\n\n334\n00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.340\nThis is the Lights Out board for it.\n\n335\n00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.377\nSo I'm connected.\n\n336\n00:16:54.377 --> 00:17:01.670\nAnd if I just get logged in to it,\nit has its own IP address, right?\n\n337\n00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:02.817\nSo a separate IP for the server.\n\n338\n00:17:02.817 --> 00:17:06.057\nThey usually have a,\na separate network jack for it.\n\n339\n00:17:06.057 --> 00:17:09.025\nSo you could run it to its own network,\nright?\n\n340\n00:17:09.025 --> 00:17:12.143\nYou might actually have\na dedicated management network.\n\n341\n00:17:12.143 --> 00:17:16.300\nAnd if you do, then this can be\nan isolated set of network traffic so\n\n342\n00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:21.375\nyou have like a network that only your\nnetwork admins have access to for example.\n\n343\n00:17:21.375 --> 00:17:25.116\nNow, it is its own little computer and\nsometimes it can be a little slow.\n\n344\n00:17:25.116 --> 00:17:26.770\nThis one seems to be crawling a bit, but\n\n345\n00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.592\nonce I get connected into it it's\ngonna bring up a user interface.\n\n346\n00:17:29.592 --> 00:17:30.994\nAnd in that web UI,\n\n347\n00:17:30.994 --> 00:17:37.170\nI will have the option to do several\nthings like powering the server on or off.\n\n348\n00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.933\nI'll be able to pull up the screen,\nthere it goes.\n\n349\n00:17:39.933 --> 00:17:40.855\nIt just took a second to load.\n\n350\n00:17:40.855 --> 00:17:42.485\nI'll be able to pull up the screen.\n\n351\n00:17:42.485 --> 00:17:44.564\nI'll be able to do a lot of\ndifferent things with it.\n\n352\n00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:45.803\nSo right off, I get a summary.\n\n353\n00:17:45.803 --> 00:17:47.128\nHere's the system health.\n\n354\n00:17:47.128 --> 00:17:48.128\nDoesnt' have power.\n\n355\n00:17:48.128 --> 00:17:51.760\nNotice how I can a momentary\npress of the power button.\n\n356\n00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.262\nIf it was turned off, I could hit this and\nit would turn it on, right?\n\n357\n00:17:55.262 --> 00:17:59.706\nOr I could get it to turn the server off,\nI could shut it down, right?\n\n358\n00:17:59.706 --> 00:18:02.561\nWe can turn on the identifier light,\nthe UID light.\n\n359\n00:18:02.561 --> 00:18:04.842\nMost servers have a little\nblue light on them.\n\n360\n00:18:04.842 --> 00:18:08.182\nIf you have a rack, or\nseveral racks with 100 servers in them,\n\n361\n00:18:08.182 --> 00:18:11.190\nhow do you find the server\nyou're working on?\n\n362\n00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:15.229\nYou could hit this button, and the little\nlight will light up, and now it's on.\n\n363\n00:18:15.229 --> 00:18:18.326\nThen the server that I'm\nmessing with is behind us.\n\n364\n00:18:18.326 --> 00:18:20.397\nActually I don't see the blue light\nthough, it's back there somewhere.\n\n365\n00:18:20.397 --> 00:18:25.613\nBut it'll turn on, I just turned it off,\nthat's what I did, didn't I.\n\n366\n00:18:25.613 --> 00:18:26.652\nIf I paid attention to\nwhat was on my screen.\n\n367\n00:18:26.652 --> 00:18:28.413\nAnd yeah, now it's actually on.\n\n368\n00:18:28.413 --> 00:18:29.941\nYou can't see it on camera.\n\n369\n00:18:29.941 --> 00:18:30.980\nIt's actually behind Wes.\n\n370\n00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.389\nBut the little blue light came on.\n\n371\n00:18:32.389 --> 00:18:35.778\nAnd the cool part it, the blue light\nis on on the front of the server and\n\n372\n00:18:35.778 --> 00:18:37.071\non the back of the server.\n\n373\n00:18:37.071 --> 00:18:39.771\nSo if I were to go around to the back side\nof the rack, where you're looking at power\n\n374\n00:18:39.771 --> 00:18:41.900\ncables and network checks,\nthere's a blue light there, too.\n\n375\n00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.338\nI can find the server I'm working on,\nthanks to remote tools like this one.\n\n376\n00:18:45.338 --> 00:18:46.758\nI'm gonna turn that off.\n\n377\n00:18:46.758 --> 00:18:49.532\nAnd then I can launch a remote console.\n\n378\n00:18:49.532 --> 00:18:52.356\nSo I can actually see\nthe console on that screen.\n\n379\n00:18:52.356 --> 00:18:54.379\nBut you can go even further,\nthere's so much stuff.\n\n380\n00:18:54.379 --> 00:18:58.110\nThis one has virtual media where\nI can take an ISO image and\n\n381\n00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.300\nmount it as if was in the CD drive.\n\n382\n00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.477\nRemember I said you can't\nput a CD in the tray?\n\n383\n00:19:02.477 --> 00:19:04.890\nI can virtually do it,\nright here through the ILO.\n\n384\n00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:06.550\nRight, I can pop that in and edit.\n\n385\n00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:10.775\nAnd then you got the power management here\nwhere I can do the momentary press, but\n\n386\n00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:13.711\nI can also press and hold or\ndo a cold boot or even a reset.\n\n387\n00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:15.617\nIf it's locked up,\nI may just wanna reset it.\n\n388\n00:19:15.617 --> 00:19:19.211\nOr if I'm trying to get into the BIOS,\nI might to do a cold boot.\n\n389\n00:19:19.211 --> 00:19:21.620\nSo I can tell it, and\nit'll take that action on the server.\n\n390\n00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:26.109\nSo this type of functionality is\nreally the equivalent of a KVM right?\n\n391\n00:19:26.109 --> 00:19:30.520\nAnd it can be authenticated and\nprovided over a secure web connection.\n\n392\n00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.930\nSo that's kind of a nice part\nabout these technologies.\n\n393\n00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:34.129\nUnder the remote console,\n\n394\n00:19:34.129 --> 00:19:37.320\nyou'll see I've got several different\nkinds of consoles I can pull up.\n\n395\n00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.723\nLet me see if I can launch the Java one.\n\n396\n00:19:38.723 --> 00:19:42.416\nJava's a little Wonky on my system.\n\n397\n00:19:42.416 --> 00:19:44.836\nActually I don't have to\nqualify it like that.\n\n398\n00:19:44.836 --> 00:19:48.327\nI can just say Java is a little wonky,\nbecause it is.\n\n399\n00:19:48.327 --> 00:19:51.749\nBut we're just gonna reach in here and\nconnect as soon as I get past all\n\n400\n00:19:51.749 --> 00:19:55.900\nthe security prompts that tell me\nabout how I shouldn't use Java.\n\n401\n00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.828\nAnd once I get connected, I'll be\nlooking at the console of the server.\n\n402\n00:19:59.828 --> 00:20:03.821\nAnd if it's asleep, it said no video.\n\n403\n00:20:03.821 --> 00:20:05.856\nAnd then when I hit a key on my keyboard,\nit woke up.\n\n404\n00:20:05.856 --> 00:20:10.773\nAnd now I'm looking at the login screen,\nand I can send a Ctrl+Alt+Delete to it and\n\n405\n00:20:10.773 --> 00:20:11.820\nnow I can come in.\n\n406\n00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.691\nAnd if I can remember the password,\nI can get logged in.\n\n407\n00:20:14.691 --> 00:20:18.967\nAnd now, I'm working on that\nserver as if I were sitting at it.\n\n408\n00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:21.724\nNow, I have to be careful\nhere because If I'm done and\n\n409\n00:20:21.724 --> 00:20:25.680\nI just close the web page,\nI'm still logged in on that machine.\n\n410\n00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.911\nAnd somebody else could walk up to it,\nor access the ILO board.\n\n411\n00:20:29.911 --> 00:20:33.189\nThey'd have to have the username and\npassword to the ILO board, but\n\n412\n00:20:33.189 --> 00:20:35.740\nthen it would be me\nlogged into that server.\n\n413\n00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.799\nRight, and I don't necessarily want that.\n\n414\n00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:40.906\nSo I need to make sure that when\nI'm done messing around in there,\n\n415\n00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:43.230\nthat I go in and I logged out, right.\n\n416\n00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.927\nOr at least lock my screen or whatever.\n\n417\n00:20:45.927 --> 00:20:50.671\nSo that's always a concern when you\nwork with stuff like this, that you\n\n418\n00:20:50.671 --> 00:20:56.390\nwanna make sure that you don't just\nleave it where you can get compromised.\n\n419\n00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:59.008\n&gt;&gt; Don, you've had me before remote in and\n\n420\n00:20:59.008 --> 00:21:01.942\ndo just basic restart\na DHCP server one time.\n\n421\n00:21:01.942 --> 00:21:04.135\nAnd we were using a technology\ncalled XenCenter and\n\n422\n00:21:04.135 --> 00:21:06.570\nit was controlling multiple\nservers at one time.\n\n423\n00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:10.045\nWhat would you classify this as an example\nof if you were gonna say this is a way to\n\n424\n00:21:10.045 --> 00:21:11.373\nadminister to your servers?\n\n425\n00:21:11.373 --> 00:21:15.049\nHow would you classify something like\nthat where it's a piece of software,\n\n426\n00:21:15.049 --> 00:21:19.420\nmultiple servers that you can see, you\ncan pretty much administer to each one.\n\n427\n00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.926\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, I don't know if\nthere's an official term or anything.\n\n428\n00:21:21.926 --> 00:21:25.709\nIt's just like centralized monitoring\nsoftware that, what I've been showing you\n\n429\n00:21:25.709 --> 00:21:28.810\nguys here, these are usually\nhardware solutions or whatever.\n\n430\n00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.733\nThere are software solutions\nthat do a lot of this stuff.\n\n431\n00:21:30.733 --> 00:21:34.490\nMost of the software solutions though,\nonly work when the system is on.\n\n432\n00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:39.934\nAnd see, you gave the example of XenCenter\nor we could say VMWare's vSphere server,\n\n433\n00:21:39.934 --> 00:21:45.160\nMicrosoft's System Center Operations\nManager, software suites like Bomgar.\n\n434\n00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.960\nWhat they do is, they let you collect\nall your servers together in one area.\n\n435\n00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.715\nAnd so you can view their status.\n\n436\n00:21:50.715 --> 00:21:52.388\nYou can see, are they up or are they down?\n\n437\n00:21:52.388 --> 00:21:57.550\nAnd then if they're up, you can\nremotely establish a session to them.\n\n438\n00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.059\nAnd it's being done through software.\n\n439\n00:21:59.059 --> 00:22:03.910\nSoftware that has to be running,\nso the server has to be working.\n\n440\n00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.881\nIf the server is not working your KDM and\nstuff, they'll let you see things.\n\n441\n00:22:06.881 --> 00:22:08.212\nYou can power on the server.\n\n442\n00:22:08.212 --> 00:22:10.171\nWith software,\nI can't really power on the server.\n\n443\n00:22:10.171 --> 00:22:12.249\nMaybe you can use Wake-On-Lan\nwhich rarely works.\n\n444\n00:22:12.249 --> 00:22:16.584\nBut normally, if there's a problem on a\nserver you are going to think on physical\n\n445\n00:22:16.584 --> 00:22:18.200\naccess at that point.\n\n446\n00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.600\nBut don't discount softer because our\nserver normally working right except for\n\n447\n00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.362\nour day to day operations like West said.\n\n448\n00:22:23.362 --> 00:22:25.305\nI’m just restarting a DHCP service.\n\n449\n00:22:25.305 --> 00:22:27.599\nI don't need a crazy hardware solution for\nthat.\n\n450\n00:22:27.599 --> 00:22:28.844\nI just remote into the server.\n\n451\n00:22:28.844 --> 00:22:33.900\nI might use something like\nMicrosoft's Remote Desktop protocol or\n\n452\n00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:37.190\nVNC, Virtual Network Computing, right?\n\n453\n00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.939\nMost of you are probably\nfamiliar with these, but\n\n454\n00:22:39.939 --> 00:22:42.098\njust to kinda cover a few of them, VNC,\n\n455\n00:22:42.098 --> 00:22:46.697\nit was originally created as some kind of\nside project at AT&amp;T if I remember right.\n\n456\n00:22:46.697 --> 00:22:52.539\nBut it's a Software utility that you\nremotely view the screen of a computer and\n\n457\n00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:57.780\nits supported by every operating system,\nLinux, Windows, Mac OS.\n\n458\n00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.644\nThey all support it.\n\n459\n00:22:58.644 --> 00:23:02.671\nThis site here, Realvnc.com,\nthese are your original people.\n\n460\n00:23:02.671 --> 00:23:04.267\nThey did open source a lot of it so\n\n461\n00:23:04.267 --> 00:23:08.425\nthere is third party VNC implementations\nlike TightVNC that are completely free.\n\n462\n00:23:08.425 --> 00:23:10.087\nRealVNC actually cost money.\n\n463\n00:23:10.087 --> 00:23:11.495\nBut they all work the same.\n\n464\n00:23:11.495 --> 00:23:12.739\nThey let you see the remote screen.\n\n465\n00:23:12.739 --> 00:23:16.341\nSome of them have better authentication\nthan others, some of them have encryption,\n\n466\n00:23:16.341 --> 00:23:17.310\nothers don't.\n\n467\n00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.589\nBut the basic functionality\nof seeing a screen is there.\n\n468\n00:23:19.589 --> 00:23:24.948\nMicrosoft's remote desktop, it's built\ninto Windows and it works great.\n\n469\n00:23:24.948 --> 00:23:28.421\nIt's really fast, faster than BMC,\nbut it only works on Windows.\n\n470\n00:23:28.421 --> 00:23:31.301\nSo, for example, that server that we\nwere just looking at, if I wanted\n\n471\n00:23:31.301 --> 00:23:34.090\nto remote into it, I could fire up\na remote desktop and connect to it.\n\n472\n00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:38.643\nHere, let me fire up from my desktop.\n\n473\n00:23:38.643 --> 00:23:40.926\nAnd we have a little hyper V\nserver here in the building.\n\n474\n00:23:40.926 --> 00:23:43.623\nIt's actually on the other\nside of the building.\n\n475\n00:23:43.623 --> 00:23:47.094\nAnd if I wanted to mess around with\nsome hyper V servers on it, or\n\n476\n00:23:47.094 --> 00:23:50.680\nsome virtual machines,\nI can remotely connect into it.\n\n477\n00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.088\nAnd so I can just fire this up.\n\n478\n00:23:53.088 --> 00:23:54.582\nAnd I'm connecting over the network.\n\n479\n00:23:54.582 --> 00:23:57.082\nI've got a certificate to\nvalidate its authenticity.\n\n480\n00:23:57.082 --> 00:23:59.294\nYou know,\nis it the server I want it to be.\n\n481\n00:23:59.294 --> 00:24:02.555\nAnd once I get connected, here it is.\n\n482\n00:24:02.555 --> 00:24:03.267\nIt’s logging me in.\n\n483\n00:24:03.267 --> 00:24:05.376\nAnd I'm now connected to that server.\n\n484\n00:24:05.376 --> 00:24:07.980\nAnd I can fire up my Hyper V manager.\n\n485\n00:24:09.722 --> 00:24:11.354\nAnd there we go.\n\n486\n00:24:11.354 --> 00:24:13.813\nAnd now I can start working\nwith some of these servers,\n\n487\n00:24:13.813 --> 00:24:17.196\nwhich these are all Mike's servers,\nso I probably won't mess with them.\n\n488\n00:24:17.196 --> 00:24:19.524\nBut we can jump in, and\nyou'll see various lab servers and things.\n\n489\n00:24:19.524 --> 00:24:22.512\nAnd we can start to mess around,\nmanipulate it.\n\n490\n00:24:22.512 --> 00:24:24.639\nI didn't have to go all the way\nacross the building, and\n\n491\n00:24:24.639 --> 00:24:25.781\ngo in that room and work on it.\n\n492\n00:24:25.781 --> 00:24:26.775\nI can do it right from here.\n\n493\n00:24:26.775 --> 00:24:29.160\nNow I might have a VM that's broken.\n\n494\n00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.208\nBut the server itself, the host is\nworking and so I can manage it, right?\n\n495\n00:24:33.208 --> 00:24:36.368\nMicrosoft's remote desktop, VNC.\n\n496\n00:24:36.368 --> 00:24:42.144\nThere's other ones out there like NX,\nthere's a few others.\n\n497\n00:24:42.144 --> 00:24:43.975\nThey'll let you see a screen like this.\n\n498\n00:24:43.975 --> 00:24:48.434\nThey're all built really around the same\nidea, and so they all really work well.\n\n499\n00:24:48.434 --> 00:24:52.161\nLogMeIn, Join.Me, those guys, those\nare usually a little more interactive,\n\n500\n00:24:52.161 --> 00:24:53.682\nthis is a little more automated.\n\n501\n00:24:53.682 --> 00:24:56.826\nBut there is also one which is\nbuilt in to other softwares.\n\n502\n00:24:56.826 --> 00:24:59.942\nSo I mentioned bamgar earlier.\n\n503\n00:24:59.942 --> 00:25:01.129\nWhere did that webpage go?\n\n504\n00:25:01.129 --> 00:25:02.407\nI got to log out of this server.\n\n505\n00:25:02.407 --> 00:25:04.040\nThat would probably help.\n\n506\n00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.840\nThat's one thing, when you start\nremoting into a lot of systems,\n\n507\n00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.750\nyou kind of forget which\ncomputer you are on.\n\n508\n00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:12.354\nSo it is possible to make a mistake like\nyour not allowed to browse the internet\n\n509\n00:25:12.354 --> 00:25:13.082\nfrom a server.\n\n510\n00:25:13.082 --> 00:25:16.495\nBut maybe I forget that I'm logged into\na server, and I launch a web browser and\n\n511\n00:25:16.495 --> 00:25:18.061\nthat's not something we wanna do.\n\n512\n00:25:18.061 --> 00:25:22.277\nBut, here we go,\nthis is a Bomgar’s website.\n\n513\n00:25:22.277 --> 00:25:25.064\nThey make a suite of software that\nis designed for Help Desks, right.\n\n514\n00:25:25.064 --> 00:25:28.460\nThat they can monitor systems if a user\ncalls, and says hey I'm having a problem.\n\n515\n00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.054\nYou can just quickly pull up their\ndesktop and seeing what they are seeing.\n\n516\n00:25:31.054 --> 00:25:36.514\nSo they have remote support built in as\none of their products that you can see.\n\n517\n00:25:36.514 --> 00:25:38.247\nI mean, they do a lot of other stuff, too.\n\n518\n00:25:38.247 --> 00:25:41.686\nBut as far remote management\nadministration, and\n\n519\n00:25:41.686 --> 00:25:44.088\nit works on your servers, as well.\n\n520\n00:25:44.088 --> 00:25:49.884\nMicrosoft has System Center 2016 which is,\nthis webpage is not much to look at.\n\n521\n00:25:49.884 --> 00:25:52.195\nBut this is System Center 2016 page,\n\n522\n00:25:52.195 --> 00:25:56.300\nand it lets you monitor performance and\nall that across all your servers.\n\n523\n00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:00.617\nAnd you can pull up screens to be able to\nmanipulate and administer the servers and\n\n524\n00:26:00.617 --> 00:26:02.917\ntroubleshoot them and you can do that too.\n\n525\n00:26:02.917 --> 00:26:06.387\nIn the Linux world, we don't normally\nneed it because we just use SSH.\n\n526\n00:26:06.387 --> 00:26:09.173\nPersonally, I use a software package.\n\n527\n00:26:09.173 --> 00:26:11.789\nI don't make any money for\nthis, just so you know.\n\n528\n00:26:11.789 --> 00:26:16.079\nBut I have this software that\nis my favorite called Royal TS.\n\n529\n00:26:16.079 --> 00:26:19.350\nAnd Royal TS runs on Mac and Windows.\n\n530\n00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:26.052\nAnd you can store tons of\nconsole connections into it.\n\n531\n00:26:26.052 --> 00:26:33.562\nNot just like, a serial console, but\nyou can Can do VNC, RDP, SSH, WebGY.\n\n532\n00:26:33.562 --> 00:26:36.548\nAnd it stores it all in a database,\nso it's really easy to pull it up.\n\n533\n00:26:36.548 --> 00:26:40.598\nSo I use this cuz it kind of consolidates\nall of the products that I just mentioned\n\n534\n00:26:40.598 --> 00:26:41.453\ninto one thing.\n\n535\n00:26:41.453 --> 00:26:43.918\nI use this software every single day.\n\n536\n00:26:43.918 --> 00:26:48.786\nSo there's plenty of solutions out there,\nI guess, is the moral of that story.\n\n537\n00:26:48.786 --> 00:26:50.001\nFind the one that works for you.\n\n538\n00:26:50.001 --> 00:26:54.781\nFInd the one that meets your needs as\nan organization or as an individual, so\n\n539\n00:26:54.781 --> 00:26:57.259\nyou can easily administer this stuff.\n\n540\n00:26:57.259 --> 00:26:59.136\nHave I left anything out?\n\n541\n00:26:59.136 --> 00:27:00.073\nI showed RDP.\n\n542\n00:27:00.073 --> 00:27:02.062\nVNC looks the same way.\n\n543\n00:27:02.062 --> 00:27:06.073\nSSH, I guess if you want to see SSH.\n\n544\n00:27:06.073 --> 00:27:07.907\nWhat can I SSH into?\n\n545\n00:27:07.907 --> 00:27:12.492\nI'm trying to think if I have any systems\nlaying around that I can SSH into.\n\n546\n00:27:12.492 --> 00:27:16.438\nWe'll see if it's enabled on our firewall.\n\n547\n00:27:16.438 --> 00:27:19.247\nLooks like it is.\n\n548\n00:27:19.247 --> 00:27:24.415\nI guess I'd have to remember the password\nto our firewall in order to do that.\n\n549\n00:27:24.415 --> 00:27:28.351\nI could try our switch, but the way\nSSH works is it's taking what would\n\n550\n00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:32.888\nbe the equivalent of a Telnet session,\nright, a text based shell connection and\n\n551\n00:27:32.888 --> 00:27:35.043\nputting it over an encrypted tunnel.\n\n552\n00:27:35.043 --> 00:27:40.846\nSo I can SSH into a device like our\nswitch, I guess I'll try that one.\n\n553\n00:27:40.846 --> 00:27:47.528\nAnd when I connect into it, I can provide\nmy password, which I might remember.\n\n554\n00:27:47.528 --> 00:27:49.775\nAnd then I can gain\naccess to its console and\n\n555\n00:27:49.775 --> 00:27:52.847\nstart to work with it over\na secure encrypted connection.\n\n556\n00:27:52.847 --> 00:27:55.281\nAnd apparently I don't\nremember the password.\n\n557\n00:27:55.281 --> 00:27:55.883\nYou know what?\n\n558\n00:27:55.883 --> 00:27:58.431\nActually I think it uses\na different username.\n\n559\n00:27:58.431 --> 00:28:02.863\nHP doesn't like admin, they use manager.\n\n560\n00:28:02.863 --> 00:28:05.935\nAnd now we'll see if that works.\n\n561\n00:28:05.935 --> 00:28:06.892\nThere we go.\n\n562\n00:28:06.892 --> 00:28:09.413\nAnd so now, I can get in, and\nI'm connected to our switch,\n\n563\n00:28:09.413 --> 00:28:11.135\nwhich is called Switchy McSwitch Face.\n\n564\n00:28:11.135 --> 00:28:14.729\nAnd it's our appropriate\nITProTV naming convention.\n\n565\n00:28:14.729 --> 00:28:18.380\nBut once I'm in here,\nI can start to work with the switch, and\n\n566\n00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:23.828\npull up the interfaces, and start looking\nat configurations, and working with it.\n\n567\n00:28:23.828 --> 00:28:26.773\nAll over a secure connection and\njust like VNC or RDP,\n\n568\n00:28:26.773 --> 00:28:30.841\nwhere you're remoting into a desktop,\nhere I'm remoting into a shell.\n\n569\n00:28:30.841 --> 00:28:34.125\nAnd I know it's encrypted\nbecause I used SSH and\n\n570\n00:28:34.125 --> 00:28:38.243\nwe pushed it over a tunnel and\nso it's a secure connection.\n\n571\n00:28:38.243 --> 00:28:40.496\nI didn't have to configure this software,\nit was built in.\n\n572\n00:28:40.496 --> 00:28:44.370\nA lot of systems come with their\nmanagement software already built in,\n\n573\n00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:45.605\nRDP being an example.\n\n574\n00:28:45.605 --> 00:28:47.187\nIn the Mac world, you have VNC.\n\n575\n00:28:47.187 --> 00:28:50.941\nOn the Linux world you usually just\nhave SSH which on a server is fine.\n\n576\n00:28:50.941 --> 00:28:54.564\nBut if you have a GUI on that server then\nyou might need to add VNC to be able to\n\n577\n00:28:54.564 --> 00:28:55.096\nget that.\n\n578\n00:28:56.793 --> 00:28:57.299\nAll right,\n\n579\n00:28:57.299 --> 00:29:00.494\nI think as far as remote administration\nis concerned that's probably it.\n\n580\n00:29:00.494 --> 00:29:04.570\nThere's even more out there, like Windows\nPowerShell and Win RM, and all those guys.\n\n581\n00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:08.829\nBut we could turn this into a ten hour\nshow if we tried to cover them all.\n\n582\n00:29:08.829 --> 00:29:12.695\nBut for the exam, they just want you to\nknow that there are physical connections\n\n583\n00:29:12.695 --> 00:29:15.301\nfor viewing the local console\nthat will always work.\n\n584\n00:29:15.301 --> 00:29:18.730\nAnd then there's software solutions for\nviewing the console, but\n\n585\n00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:22.775\nthey kind of expect the server to be\nperforming normally for those to function.\n\n586\n00:29:22.775 --> 00:29:24.586\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, well,\nthat's a lot of great information.\n\n587\n00:29:24.586 --> 00:29:27.529\nI can't wait for the episode when we\ngo into switch naming conventions.\n\n588\n00:29:27.529 --> 00:29:28.355\nThat one will be fun for sure.\n\n589\n00:29:28.355 --> 00:29:31.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It does look like though, again,\n\n590\n00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.857\nwe are coming to the end\nof another episode.\n\n591\n00:29:32.857 --> 00:29:33.801\nBut before we do, Don,\n\n592\n00:29:33.801 --> 00:29:36.644\ndo you have any parting words that\nyou'd like to let our audience know?\n\n593\n00:29:36.644 --> 00:29:37.700\n&gt;&gt; I think that's about it.\n\n594\n00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.970\nTry all the different management\nproducts that are out there.\n\n595\n00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.622\nYou'll find one that you\nlike more than the others.\n\n596\n00:29:42.622 --> 00:29:46.927\nLike I said, for me, it took me\nyears to finally get into Royal TS.\n\n597\n00:29:46.927 --> 00:29:51.283\nI used to use Secure CRT and\nother programs before that.\n\n598\n00:29:51.283 --> 00:29:53.982\nRD Tabs,\nthere's a ton of them that are out there.\n\n599\n00:29:53.982 --> 00:29:55.257\nSame thing goes for.\n\n600\n00:29:55.257 --> 00:29:56.566\nTry a few different ones.\n\n601\n00:29:56.566 --> 00:30:00.110\nIf you get one that's frustrating,\nthere's other vendors that are out there.\n\n602\n00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.995\nThere's some big names.\n\n603\n00:30:00.995 --> 00:30:03.245\nAvisant you see pretty much\neverywhere these days.\n\n604\n00:30:03.245 --> 00:30:06.444\nBut Blackbox makes great stuff,\nOpen Gear makes great stuff.\n\n605\n00:30:06.444 --> 00:30:08.279\nJust try them out.\n\n606\n00:30:08.279 --> 00:30:10.929\nA lot of them have trials and\ndemos so you can experiment and\n\n607\n00:30:10.929 --> 00:30:12.290\nfind what works best for you.\n\n608\n00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.867\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don well thank you for\nbeing here in the studios with us.\n\n609\n00:30:14.867 --> 00:30:16.663\nAnd thank you the viewers for watching.\n\n610\n00:30:16.663 --> 00:30:21.012\nSigning out for IT Pro TV, I've been your\nhosting Wes Switchy McSwitchface Brian.\n\n611\n00:30:21.012 -->

00:00:11.845\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:16.081\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another exciting episode\nhere at ITProTV, I'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n5\n00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:19.076\nAnd in today's episode we\nare continuing through\n\n6\n00:00:19.076 --> 00:00:22.722\nour CompTIA Server+ SK0-004\ncertification course.\n\n7\n00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:26.200\nAnd joining us back in the studios\ntoday is none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.430\nDon how are you doing sir?\n\n9\n00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.120\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing just well, Wes,\nready to dive into a new objective.\n\n10\n00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.300\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\ntackling the server maintenance objective,\n\n11\n00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.710\nwhich is probably one of my most\nfavorite of all the objectives.\n\n12\n00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.210\nBecause it's stinking massive,\n\n13\n00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.890\nit is a gigantic objective that\ncovers a ton of different topics.\n\n14\n00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.200\nSo we're gonna be going through them all.\n\n15\n00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.540\nThis is gonna be a multi part episode,\ncuz it;s just a lot to get through.\n\n16\n00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.020\nBut server maintenance is really,\n\n17\n00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.910\nreally critical, and that's why it's\nsuch a big objective, it needs to be.\n\n18\n00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.650\nIf you think about it, it takes a lot of\ntime to plan for servers, to purchase and\n\n19\n00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.280\nprocure servers,\nyou go back the server life cycle, right?\n\n20\n00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.990\nAll those early steps, and\nthen it takes time to deploy them.\n\n21\n00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.270\nIt's a lot of work, it's hard,\nhard getting those servers set up right,\n\n22\n00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.550\nmaking the right decisions,\ngetting them deployed.\n\n23\n00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.900\nBut then once they're deployed,\nwhat happens?\n\n24\n00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.690\nThey run, they do their job, and\nhopefully they do it for years on end.\n\n25\n00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.170\nAnd during that time, what do we do?\n\n26\n00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.410\nWe don't just kick our feet up and\n\n27\n00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.410\nwatch TV, we do maintenance,\nwe make sure the servers stay running.\n\n28\n00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.540\nBecause, just because they're running\ntoday doesn't mean they'll run tomorrow.\n\n29\n00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.970\nAnd most of us have learned that lesson\nthrough numerous real life examples of\n\n30\n00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.450\nthings just not working the way\nthey're supposed to day after day.\n\n31\n00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.540\nAnd server maintenance is how we\nhandle that, how we approach it, and\n\n32\n00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.320\nhow we try to minimize the impact\nit creates on our end users.\n\n33\n00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.830\nNow the very first objective that CompTIA\ncalls out is a really important one.\n\n34\n00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.070\nI'm glad they put it first,\n\n35\n00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.940\nwhich is change management,\nthe enemy to server uptime is change.\n\n36\n00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.630\nThat if nothing changes, if everything\nstays the same your servers will run and\n\n37\n00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.600\nyou'll never have to mess with them.\n\n38\n00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.654\nThat was the glory of Novell, if any of\nyou guys ran Novell servers way back in\n\n39\n00:02:04.654 --> 00:02:07.351\nthe day, Novell NetWare,\nthat you could set up a NetWare server.\n\n40\n00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:11.840\nAnd as long as you didn't mess with it,\nit would just sit there and run, and run,\n\n41\n00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.378\nand run.\n\n42\n00:02:12.378 --> 00:02:16.732\nThere was this one story, a true story\nabout a university where just through\n\n43\n00:02:16.732 --> 00:02:20.970\nvarious projects over the years,\nthey accidentally walled up a server.\n\n44\n00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.690\nThere were two doors to this room and\nthey removed one door.\n\n45\n00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.820\nAnd then later on they\nremoved another door.\n\n46\n00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.400\nAnd they ended up with a server that\nwas walled up, and it ran for years.\n\n47\n00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.650\nAnd finally one day it started acting\nup and they went where is that server?\n\n48\n00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.600\nAnd they had to pull up blueprints, and\nthey found where there was this gap\n\n49\n00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.579\nin the walls, and\nthat's where the server ended up.\n\n50\n00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.850\nThat could happen back then,\nbut today it's not like that.\n\n51\n00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.080\nBack then you had small networks, networks\nthat weren't connected to the internet.\n\n52\n00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.720\nServers that weren't under constant\nattack like they are today.\n\n53\n00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.750\nToday, at a minimum, even if we\ndon't change our configurations,\n\n54\n00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.370\nwe've gotta deploy updates.\n\n55\n00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.640\nWe've gotta deploy patches, security\nfixes, and that is changing our platform.\n\n56\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.590\nChanging what is implemented,\neven though we don't necessarily want to.\n\n57\n00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.410\nSo because there's constant change,\n\n58\n00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.290\nwe've got this constant opportunity\nto break our systems and it happens.\n\n59\n00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.110\nIt may not be your fault,\nit may be the upstream provider, right,\n\n60\n00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.000\nit happens all the time.\n\n61\n00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.050\nMicrosoft pushes on an update or\nRedHat pushes on an update.\n\n62\n00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.720\nAnd all of a sudden some software\npackage doesn't work anymore.\n\n63\n00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.400\nAnd it might be because that software\npackage needed an update itself.\n\n64\n00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.050\nOr that vendor just hadn't accounted for\nit, or whatever.\n\n65\n00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.720\nThere's any number of scenarios\nthat can happen there,\n\n66\n00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.540\nbut they can all lead to problems.\n\n67\n00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.800\nAnd change management works to fix that,\nso\n\n68\n00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.180\nlet's talk briefly about\nchange management.\n\n69\n00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.820\nI know I've mentioned it\nin a few other episodes and\n\n70\n00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.640\nI'll probably mention it again when we\nget into asset management and stuff.\n\n71\n00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.090\nBut just at it's basics the idea behind\nchange management is that nobody should\n\n72\n00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.082\nchange a server.\n\n73\n00:03:48.082 --> 00:03:53.910\nThat servers should be pretty much static,\nunless you get approval.\n\n74\n00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.840\nAnd when we get approval,\nhow do we do that?\n\n75\n00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.280\nWell we do it through\na change request system.\n\n76\n00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.430\nSo change request is what\nI got on my laptop here.\n\n77\n00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.390\nAnd the way change requests work is, if\nyou wanna make a modification to a server,\n\n78\n00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.840\nyou fill out a little form,\nand then you submit it.\n\n79\n00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.080\nAnd somebody somewhere\ndetermines whether or\n\n80\n00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.360\nnot you should be allowed\nto make the change.\n\n81\n00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.168\nNow who is the somebody somewhere,\nwell that depends.\n\n82\n00:04:18.168 --> 00:04:20.930\nIf you're gonna implement change\nmanagement in your company,\n\n83\n00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.090\nyou really need to start by creating\nwhat's called a change management plan.\n\n84\n00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.220\nWe do these in project\nmanagement all the time.\n\n85\n00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.910\nSo I'm gonna show you a project\nmanagement example here.\n\n86\n00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.368\nBut a change management plan simply\ndictates how you're going to control\n\n87\n00:04:33.368 --> 00:04:34.771\nchange in your environment.\n\n88\n00:04:34.771 --> 00:04:38.110\nAnd this is the template that\nI use anytime I make these up.\n\n89\n00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.310\nBut basically,\nyou specify what your approach is.\n\n90\n00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.719\nAnd your approach might be, I'm gonna\nfollow ITIL standards for my organization,\n\n91\n00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:46.966\nor you know something defined in.\n\n92\n00:04:46.966 --> 00:04:50.010\nOr whatever framework it\nis that you choose to use.\n\n93\n00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.530\nAnd then you specify,\nyou're gonna create change advisory board,\n\n94\n00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.880\na group of people that would be\nauthorizing changes or whatever.\n\n95\n00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.477\nIt's the way you choose to manage\nchange in your organization,\n\n96\n00:05:00.477 --> 00:05:02.540\nthat's what a change management plan is.\n\n97\n00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.160\nThe key thing here is that\nyou can hire a new employee.\n\n98\n00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.030\nAnd you could just give them a copy\nof the change management plan and\n\n99\n00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.940\nthey can read over it and now they know.\n\n100\n00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.090\nHey, if I wanna make a change to a server,\nhere's what I need to do.\n\n101\n00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.930\nSo my change management approach might\nsay, I'm gonna follow ITIL best practices.\n\n102\n00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.750\nAnd I'm gonna require that every change\n\n103\n00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.720\ngets submitted through\na change advisory board.\n\n104\n00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.890\nAnd the change advisory board will meet\nevery Thursday at 2 PM to approve changes.\n\n105\n00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.510\nBut, if there's an emergency change,\n\n106\n00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.460\nhere's the procedure we're gonna\nfollow for emergency changes.\n\n107\n00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.886\nAnd so we can rush those too,\ncuz that happens.\n\n108\n00:05:36.886 --> 00:05:41.201\nI'm not gonna wait til Thursday at 2 PM,\nwhen a hacker is in my server right now,\n\n109\n00:05:41.201 --> 00:05:43.140\nI need to make change, right?\n\n110\n00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.889\nSo we have to have emergency processes to\nbe able to step in and take care of that.\n\n111\n00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:52.130\nSo here's how we schedule change,\nhow we budget change, the scope of change.\n\n112\n00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.450\nScope of change is important,\nthat's how big a change can be.\n\n113\n00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.510\nYou don't want one change ticket to say\n\n114\n00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.310\nI'm gonna upgrade every server in my\nentire environment to Red Hat 7.3.\n\n115\n00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.570\nIt should be, I'm gonna upgrade\nthis web server to Red Hat 7.3 and\n\n116\n00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.811\nI'm gonna upgrade this\ndatabase server to 7.3.\n\n117\n00:06:09.811 --> 00:06:12.833\nEach one managed individually,\ncuz they all have separate needs,\n\n118\n00:06:12.833 --> 00:06:15.510\nseparate risks and\nseparate exposures, right?\n\n119\n00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.710\nIf my database server goes off line,\nthat could be really really bad.\n\n120\n00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.100\nIf my fax server goes offline,\nI might not care.\n\n121\n00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.840\nSo there's different levels of\nimpact we have to worry about.\n\n122\n00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.180\nIf we have a change control board or\nchange advisory board, different name for\n\n123\n00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.620\nthe same thing.\n\n124\n00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.770\nYou specify,\nwho the people are that are on it.\n\n125\n00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.120\nAnd these might be people like the CIO or\nCTO, you might have a CISO,\n\n126\n00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.120\nor even just regular departmental people\nthat are participating in that process in\n\n127\n00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.530\nhelping to make decisions.\n\n128\n00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.500\nBut their role and responsibility\nisn't the level of authority.\n\n129\n00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.650\nYou need to designate whether some of\nthem are on the emergency contact list or\n\n130\n00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.320\nwhether they only meet in\nthe normal board meetings.\n\n131\n00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.480\n&gt;&gt; And that's what I was going to ask on,\n\n132\n00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.325\nI was thinking could there potentially\nbe two completely separate teams.\n\n133\n00:06:56.325 --> 00:06:58.310\nOne that does the change advisory board,\n\n134\n00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.948\nlike you said, then one that has to get to\nmaybe an overnight emergency right away.\n\n135\n00:07:02.948 --> 00:07:07.050\nWould we submit the same ticket\nto two different boards,\n\n136\n00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.430\nor how would we work that\nout if it is an emergency?\n\n137\n00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.190\n&gt;&gt; I've seen it handled different ways,\nand one way says that tou have\n\n138\n00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.230\nthis board that meets, and\nyou have a separate emergency board.\n\n139\n00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.630\nBut normally there's so much overlap,\n\n140\n00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.670\nI mean the emergency board is gonna be\nmade up of people from the regular board.\n\n141\n00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.470\nSo typically, instead of having\na separate board, what they'll do is say,\n\n142\n00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.820\nin an emergency, you only need\nsigned off from three people.\n\n143\n00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.900\nYou might have seven on the list,\nI just need three.\n\n144\n00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.460\nIf I can get three people to sign off,\nI can act.\n\n145\n00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:40.020\nOr the CEO or CIO can step in and\noverride the board at any moment.\n\n146\n00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.210\nAnd not in a bad way,\nin a good way, right?\n\n147\n00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.400\nIt's an emergency,\nI've got the CIO on the phone.\n\n148\n00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.590\nIf he tells me it's okay, I'm gonna do it.\n\n149\n00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.723\nOr I've got the CEO on the phone, and\nif she says it's okay, I'm gonna do it.\n\n150\n00:07:49.723 --> 00:07:51.380\nI don't need the change advisory board,\n\n151\n00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.550\nwe need to have emergency\nprocesses like that.\n\n152\n00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:57.294\nNot necessarily a separate board,\nit might be the same board,\n\n153\n00:07:57.294 --> 00:07:59.071\njust a smaller element of it.\n\n154\n00:07:59.071 --> 00:08:02.039\nThen we document things like\nhow changes are submitted.\n\n155\n00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:04.498\nHow does somebody turn\nin a change request?\n\n156\n00:08:04.498 --> 00:08:07.972\nAnd once it's submitted,\nhow do we track that change and review it?\n\n157\n00:08:07.972 --> 00:08:09.550\nHow do we dispose of it?\n\n158\n00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.250\nAnd by disposing the change, I mean\napprove it, decline it, or submit it for\n\n159\n00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.050\nmore information, right?\n\n160\n00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:14.815\nIt's called a disposition,\n\n161\n00:08:14.815 --> 00:08:16.353\nit's a little bit different\nthan throwing it in the trash.\n\n162\n00:08:16.353 --> 00:08:17.490\nRight?\n\n163\n00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:20.300\nSo that's all part of\na change management plan.\n\n164\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.520\nIt's what a change management plan does.\n\n165\n00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.870\nAnd when somebody needs to\nmake a change to the system,\n\n166\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.970\nthey'll submit a change\nrequest according to the plan.\n\n167\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.140\nNow how does this help us\nto maintain our servers?\n\n168\n00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.390\nWell, maybe one day I'm\nlooking at the server.\n\n169\n00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.680\nI got a call from an end user and\nthey're saying,\n\n170\n00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.030\nhey, I can't connect to the server,\nit's not working right.\n\n171\n00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.160\nAnd I start looking at it and\n\n172\n00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.070\nI suspect that it might be\nthe firewall running on that server.\n\n173\n00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.490\nIt's got a software firewall and\nI think that might be the problem.\n\n174\n00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:53.732\nSo I wanna open up a hole in\nthat firewall to test it out.\n\n175\n00:08:53.732 --> 00:08:56.900\nOr maybe I just wanna turn\nthe firewall off for a moment and\n\n176\n00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.805\ntest with the firewall off and\nturn it back on again.\n\n177\n00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:02.587\nSo I could just do that,\nI could just go and turn it off.\n\n178\n00:09:02.587 --> 00:09:06.586\nWell what would happen if at the same\ntime our security department was running\n\n179\n00:09:06.586 --> 00:09:07.703\na penetration test?\n\n180\n00:09:07.703 --> 00:09:11.670\nWell I just turned the firewall off,\nand that's gonna send up a red flag.\n\n181\n00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.480\nAnd they're gonna isolate that server.\n\n182\n00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.080\nNow the server's gonna go offline and\n\n183\n00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.130\nwe just created down time because\nI made an unauthorized change.\n\n184\n00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:23.900\nInstead I should have filled out a change\nticket and said, I'm testing an issue for\n\n185\n00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.830\na user, this is my business case,\nI'm testing an issue for the user.\n\n186\n00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.800\nAnd I need to turn the firewall off\njust for five minutes, just for\n\n187\n00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.210\nfive minutes to test out that connection\nto make sure it's okay, all right?\n\n188\n00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.930\nSo I'm gonna turn the firewall off for\nfive minutes.\n\n189\n00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:36.760\nI fill out my form and I tell them,\n\n190\n00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.450\nI wanna do it Wednesday at 1 PM,\nor whatever window of time it is.\n\n191\n00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.920\nIt might need to be after hours\nif it's gonna cause downtime.\n\n192\n00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.650\nAnd I submit the ticket.\n\n193\n00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.980\nNow the ticket goes for review.\n\n194\n00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.830\nAnd the CIO might look at it and\nsay, that's fine, whatever.\n\n195\n00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.990\nAnd the departmental heads say yeah,\nwhatever, that's fine.\n\n196\n00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:58.370\nBut then you get to the CISO, the Chief\nSecurity Officer, and she looks at it and\n\n197\n00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.650\nsays, well wait a minute.\n\n198\n00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.755\nDo you have to turn\nthe whole firewall off?\n\n199\n00:10:02.755 --> 00:10:04.955\nBecause that's gonna open\nup the server to everybody.\n\n200\n00:10:04.955 --> 00:10:08.175\nCouldn't you just create\na firewall rule that allowed\n\n201\n00:10:08.175 --> 00:10:12.035\nthat client to connect their IP address,\nto connect them whatever port they wanted,\n\n202\n00:10:12.035 --> 00:10:13.595\nand just clear that one client.\n\n203\n00:10:13.595 --> 00:10:16.530\nAnd that way the firewall stays up and\nthe system stays more secure.\n\n204\n00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.210\nAnd I might say, I didn't think of that.\n\n205\n00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:20.060\nI could certainly do that.\n\n206\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:20.980\nIt's just as easy.\n\n207\n00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.870\nI could pop that rule in and\npop it in right now.\n\n208\n00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.720\nAnd the server's security footprint or\n\n209\n00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.630\nthe tax surface really\nwouldn't be increased by much.\n\n210\n00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.870\nThat'd be a better way to handle it.\n\n211\n00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.280\nThey had a better idea.\n\n212\n00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.230\nThat is what a change\nadvisory board is all about.\n\n213\n00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.470\nOther people may have\ninformation that you don't.\n\n214\n00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.140\nThey may have knowledge that you don't.\n\n215\n00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.890\nAnd they can review your change and\nsuggest improvements upon it.\n\n216\n00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:43.110\nMake it better.\n\n217\n00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.810\nAnd then you move forward with it.\n\n218\n00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.810\nBut the best part,\nif we kinda scroll down on my change here,\n\n219\n00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.620\nis that we get a chance\nto justify the change.\n\n220\n00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.560\nWhy I want to make it.\n\n221\n00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.860\nI might not have a good reason.\n\n222\n00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.250\nIn which case they're\ngonna reject my change.\n\n223\n00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.080\nWell I make the reason and\nthen the impact of the change.\n\n224\n00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.180\nWhen I make this change,\nwhat systems are going to be affected?\n\n225\n00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.040\nNow, why do we need to know that?\n\n226\n00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.500\nSo that we can tell the help desk,\nhey we're about to implement this change.\n\n227\n00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.600\nThese five servers are going to be\naffected so if you start getting calls\n\n228\n00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.570\nabout any issues on these five servers,\nwe need to know about it right away.\n\n229\n00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.550\nWe need to know the impact,\nwho's gonna be affected.\n\n230\n00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.720\n&gt;&gt; Don, one thing that I don't\nsee here towards the end,\n\n231\n00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.620\nespecially when it has to deal with\nimpactive changes, a plan for a rollback.\n\n232\n00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.890\nIf I'm doing something,\nmaybe I do make a change, and\n\n233\n00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:28.710\nthe whole purpose of change managment's to\nmake sure that everything goes smoothly.\n\n234\n00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.560\nWell if Wes configures it chances\nare it's not going to go smoothly.\n\n235\n00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I need a plan to undo the changes.\n\n236\n00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.850\nIs that something we might see in\na characteristic of change management\n\n237\n00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:37.720\ndocumentation?\n\n238\n00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.128\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely yeah, and\nwhen you bill these forms out,\n\n239\n00:11:40.128 --> 00:11:41.850\nyou can add whatever you want to them.\n\n240\n00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.150\nYou make them work for your company.\n\n241\n00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:48.830\nAnd so normally we'll have what are the\nstep by step changes I intend to make.\n\n242\n00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:49.894\nAnd how can I roll them back.\n\n243\n00:11:49.894 --> 00:11:52.410\nAnd usually you put some\nmetrics in there like,\n\n244\n00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.160\nwhat are the conditions at which\npoint I decide to roll back.\n\n245\n00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.880\nCuz have you ever made a change where its\nso much work that you got through and\n\n246\n00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.600\nthen something went wrong.\n\n247\n00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.755\nAnd you had to make that decision,\nhm, should I keep working and try and\n\n248\n00:12:03.755 --> 00:12:05.120\nfix the problem?\n\n249\n00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.590\nOr should I roll back?\n\n250\n00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.980\nWell you should have known\nbefore you made the change,\n\n251\n00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.662\nat what point you crossed\nthe point of no return.\n\n252\n00:12:11.662 --> 00:12:12.220\nRight?\n\n253\n00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.840\nYou find that out through testing.\n\n254\n00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.800\nYou test out the change\nbefore you make it.\n\n255\n00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:20.170\nIf you haven't tested the change,\nthen you made your own bed.\n\n256\n00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.480\nNow you get to sleep in it.\n\n257\n00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.150\nIt's a mess and\nyou just have to fight through it.\n\n258\n00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.040\nThere's uncertainty.\n\n259\n00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.100\nBut if you've tested the change, you\nknow when that point of no return is and\n\n260\n00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.160\nhow you need to move forward.\n\n261\n00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.980\nOr you know when it's time to roll back.\n\n262\n00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.203\nBut you can certainly put that in here.\n\n263\n00:12:33.737 --> 00:12:36.920\nAt the end of the document, I have things\nlike whether it's approved or declined.\n\n264\n00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.510\nAnd a lot of times you'll see deferred,\nwhere they say hey, we're not approving,\n\n265\n00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.360\nwe're not declining, we're just\nsaying we need more information.\n\n266\n00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.700\nGive me some more information and\nthat's why we have this justification.\n\n267\n00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.070\nAnd then after that you get a signoff.\n\n268\n00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:51.270\nEverybody signs off on the change saying,\nyes we approve it, it's gonna happen.\n\n269\n00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.980\nAll right, so now what do I have?\n\n270\n00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.190\nI have a piece of paper that\ntells me exactly what's about to\n\n271\n00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.010\nhappen on a system.\n\n272\n00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.910\nI can go and make the change or\nI can give it to somebody else and\n\n273\n00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:01.210\nhave them go make the change.\n\n274\n00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:02.553\nAnd if something goes wrong,\n\n275\n00:13:02.553 --> 00:13:05.952\nit's not one of those, I wonder if\nanything changed on the network?\n\n276\n00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:08.284\nIt's a let me go check my tickets and,\nsure enough,\n\n277\n00:13:08.284 --> 00:13:10.090\nhere's what changed on the network.\n\n278\n00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.740\nNow we know exactly what happened.\n\n279\n00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.450\nThat makes maintaining our servers so\nmuch easier.\n\n280\n00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:19.590\nNow, what about things that\ndon't quite fall under change?\n\n281\n00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:23.630\nWhat if I walk in to the office one\nday and the web server's locked up?\n\n282\n00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.470\nJust locked up, it's not working.\n\n283\n00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:30.530\nAnd so I push the power button on it and\nI push the power button again.\n\n284\n00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:31.690\nThe old reboot.\n\n285\n00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.070\nServer comes up,\neverything's working great.\n\n286\n00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:34.860\nDid I make a change?\n\n287\n00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.210\nI didn't make a change, did I?\n\n288\n00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:38.650\nI just pushed the power button.\n\n289\n00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.010\nServer was already locked up,\nI didn't make it any worse.\n\n290\n00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:42.420\nI just power cycled it.\n\n291\n00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.890\nSo that's not a change.\n\n292\n00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.430\nWhat you had there is\nwhat's called an issue.\n\n293\n00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.180\nNow issues can become changes.\n\n294\n00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.380\nI had an issue, the server locked up.\n\n295\n00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.390\nI rebooted it and now it's fine.\n\n296\n00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.960\nWell, I could just go on about my day.\n\n297\n00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.130\nProblem solved,\nstandard Microsoft style and we're off.\n\n298\n00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.620\nRight?\nOr if it's a Linux server or\n\n299\n00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.065\nwhatever then you got a different\nproblem to worry about.\n\n300\n00:14:04.065 --> 00:14:06.905\nBut it's up and running now so\nwhat do I care?\n\n301\n00:14:06.905 --> 00:14:09.285\nWell then a week later it happens again.\n\n302\n00:14:09.285 --> 00:14:11.505\nBut this time it's Wes who comes in and\nhe sees it.\n\n303\n00:14:11.505 --> 00:14:13.095\nLike, push the power button,\npush it again.\n\n304\n00:14:13.095 --> 00:14:13.975\nAll right fine.\n\n305\n00:14:13.975 --> 00:14:16.450\nOff we go.\nAnd then a week later\n\n306\n00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.980\none of the other hosts comes in and\ndoes the same thing.\n\n307\n00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:23.110\nWell, none of us are making changes\njust pushing a power button, right?\n\n308\n00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.500\nBut, at the same time,\n\n309\n00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.910\nthere is a repeated pattern being built\nup, that server is locking up repeatedly.\n\n310\n00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.240\nHow do we know that?\n\n311\n00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.010\nWell, you need to keep.\n\n312\n00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:33.840\nWhich called an issue log.\n\n313\n00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.650\nAn issue log looks something like this.\n\n314\n00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:41.150\nNow, I had, it came up for just a second,\na change log which is almost identical.\n\n315\n00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.010\nA change log is just a list of all\nthe changes that have been made\n\n316\n00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:45.570\nto a particular system.\n\n317\n00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.448\nSo that when I go to\na particular server I'm like,\n\n318\n00:14:47.448 --> 00:14:49.029\nwhat has gone on on this server recently?\n\n319\n00:14:49.029 --> 00:14:51.190\nI can pull up the last couple of changes.\n\n320\n00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:53.190\nAn issue log is similar.\n\n321\n00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:58.020\nWith an an issue log we're tracking any\ntime an event occurred on that system.\n\n322\n00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:02.310\nNot necessarily a change, but\njust an issue of some sort.\n\n323\n00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.340\nUser reports server slow.\n\n324\n00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.340\nUsers can't connect to server.\n\n325\n00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.670\nServer locked up.\n\n326\n00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.570\nServer gave a thermal warning.\n\n327\n00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:10.560\nMaybe I didn't have to do anything.\n\n328\n00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.570\nI just power cycled or\nI waited and it went away.\n\n329\n00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.720\nSolved itself, that does happen, right?\n\n330\n00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.220\nSo maybe that happened,\nbut I need a record of it.\n\n331\n00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.220\nAnd so we keep an issue log for that.\n\n332\n00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.350\nNow, in the case of user reports slowness,\nmaybe I go and check and\n\n333\n00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.370\nit actually turned out to\nbe the user's machine.\n\n334\n00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.890\nSo I didn't need a change on the surface,\nnot a change.\n\n335\n00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.470\nOr the server was locked up.\n\n336\n00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:34.020\nI just power cycled it and\nit's not an issue change, a change ticket.\n\n337\n00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:36.970\nThe air conditioning unit\nwasn't quite functioning right.\n\n338\n00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.460\nThere were too many servers in room or\nsomething and so\n\n339\n00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.970\nit wasn't this server that was the\nproblem, but there was an issue somewhere.\n\n340\n00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.710\nI've gotta fix that issue, right?\n\n341\n00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.270\nI've gotta order in maintenance to\ncome in to fix that air conditioning.\n\n342\n00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:50.470\nWell that's not really a change\nit's just maintenance, so\n\n343\n00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.109\nthat would go in the issue log.\n\n344\n00:15:52.109 --> 00:15:56.529\nBut if a user calls in and says,\nhey the server's slow and I take a look at\n\n345\n00:15:56.529 --> 00:16:00.678\nthe server and I find that,\nhey we've hired a lot more employees.\n\n346\n00:16:00.678 --> 00:16:03.824\nAnd our data set has grown and\nthe server is slow.\n\n347\n00:16:03.824 --> 00:16:07.634\nI need to upgrade the disk or\noptimize the database.\n\n348\n00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:09.010\nNow, that is a change.\n\n349\n00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.600\nA change to resolve the issue.\n\n350\n00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.040\nSo the issue can become a change ticket.\n\n351\n00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.240\nRight?\nSo it can transition to the other one.\n\n352\n00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.820\nBut always keep an issue log.\n\n353\n00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.700\nEvery little event that happens should\ngo in the issue log, so that you've got\n\n354\n00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.720\na record of it, even though it's not\nalways going to end up being a change.\n\n355\n00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.880\nAll right, so I know that's not the most\nfun thing in the world to talk about, but\n\n356\n00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.100\nit is important.\n\n357\n00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.090\nAnd for those of you that work\nin a small business where\n\n358\n00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.200\nyou are the IT department all by yourself,\n\n359\n00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.930\nyou're probably laughing right now,\nthinking, I'm gonna fill these forms out.\n\n360\n00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.600\nWhat a waste of time.\n\n361\n00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.450\nYou're probably right.\n\n362\n00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.910\nIf you just have one employer or even two\nor three and you just talk to each other,\n\n363\n00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.400\nyou probably don't need\nthis whole system in place.\n\n364\n00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.070\nBut, if you're gonna work\non a large business or\n\n365\n00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:53.640\nan enterprise, where you got\nnumerous IT administrators all and\n\n366\n00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.650\nthey're making changes the same time,\nit's a nightmare.\n\n367\n00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.740\nIt is an absolute nightmare.\n\n368\n00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:02.890\nYou've got to have a good change\nmanagement policy in place.\n\n369\n00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.480\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, when it comes to\nmaintaining stability in uptime\n\n370\n00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.180\nas you pointed out is the goal\nof change management.\n\n371\n00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.940\nThat's not the only system\nwe have out there that\n\n372\n00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.600\nultimately when it comes down\nto is things like security and\n\n373\n00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.300\nmaking sure that our systems are up and\nthat we have access to them.\n\n374\n00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.710\nWhat would another system be?\n\n375\n00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:24.060\n&gt;&gt; In addition to change management\nsomething that goes hand in hand with it\n\n376\n00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.040\nis patch management.\n\n377\n00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.950\nI mentioned at the beginning of\nthe episode that hey security updates come\n\n378\n00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:29.700\nout, things change.\n\n379\n00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.640\nAnd so we have to deploy those security\nupdates in order to keep our systems\n\n380\n00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.580\nsecure and safe, otherwise were going\nto get hacked into, or compromised, or\n\n381\n00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.820\njust have instability on the system.\n\n382\n00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.240\nIt doesn't have to be hackers,\nthey're not responsible for everything.\n\n383\n00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.360\nBut either way it's a change, right.\n\n384\n00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.790\nWe need to change the system\nto implement these updates.\n\n385\n00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.520\nAnd so patch management is\nusually treated separately.\n\n386\n00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.160\nBecause we don't necessarily need a whole\nchange advisory board to meet to say.\n\n387\n00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.830\nYeah, I want to apply a security update.\n\n388\n00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.680\nThat one's kind of a no-brainer.\n\n389\n00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.220\nFor security updates.\n\n390\n00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.930\nWhat about feature updates?\n\n391\n00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.250\nThat's a different story, right?\n\n392\n00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.935\nFeature updates probably need to go\nthrough the change advisory board.\n\n393\n00:18:01.935 --> 00:18:03.816\nBut patches, hot-fixes,\n\n394\n00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:07.545\nthose things, those make your\nsystem more stable we want those.\n\n395\n00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:11.785\nNow you dont want to just go and roll\nthem right out though because sometimes\n\n396\n00:18:11.785 --> 00:18:13.525\nthey can break things, it happens.\n\n397\n00:18:13.525 --> 00:18:17.555\nAnd it's not like intentional, it's not\nsomething that was set out to do, it's not\n\n398\n00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:23.125\neven poor coding normally an update like\nthis will fix a security exploit and\n\n399\n00:18:23.125 --> 00:18:27.135\nthere may be some software out there that\njust isn't able to handle that properly.\n\n400\n00:18:27.135 --> 00:18:31.010\nIt just wasn't written properly, and\nso it can cause that software to fail.\n\n401\n00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:33.640\nSo, when we start doing\nthings like patching,\n\n402\n00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.020\nwe need to have agood management\nsystem in place for it.\n\n403\n00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.070\nLet's pretend we're in a Windows world.\n\n404\n00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.160\nIf we have all Windows machines,\nyou can set up a Windows update.\n\n405\n00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.405\nAnd what are they gonna do?\n\n406\n00:18:42.405 --> 00:18:46.150\nThey're gonna reache out to Microsoft and\nMicrosoft is gonna give them a big list of\n\n407\n00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.880\nupdates, they're gonna roll out right now,\nand you get them.\n\n408\n00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.650\nWell, sometimes Microsoft rolls out things\nlike a new version of Internet Explorer.\n\n409\n00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:57.300\nI remember when IE 10 came out and\nreally even IE 9 did this.\n\n410\n00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.440\nWhen it came out, they released it and\nthey marked it as a critical update.\n\n411\n00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.990\nAnd so everybody's machine got it.\n\n412\n00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:07.140\nThey're like you gotta get to IE 9,\nIE 8 is gone.\n\n413\n00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:10.000\nWell they were still doing\nsecurity updates for IE 8.\n\n414\n00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.260\nSo you could keep running\nInternet Explorer 8.\n\n415\n00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:16.385\nThey wanted you to go to IE9 because\nit added some new HTML5 rendering or\n\n416\n00:19:16.385 --> 00:19:18.120\ntab support or something crazy like that.\n\n417\n00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.220\nI can't remember right now.\n\n418\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.320\nBut they wanted you to go to it,\nbut it wasn't a necessity.\n\n419\n00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.580\nBut they flagged it as a critical update,\nso machines got it.\n\n420\n00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.370\nWell, I worked for an organization at the\ntime that had document imaging software\n\n421\n00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:29.940\nthat wasn't supported under IE9 yet.\n\n422\n00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.720\nThey were still updating all the webpage.\n\n423\n00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.060\nAnd so if you went into IE9,\nit messed it up.\n\n424\n00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.020\nAnd you can run in compatibility mode or\nwhatever but\n\n425\n00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.750\nit made things just not work right.\n\n426\n00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:43.260\nI needed everybody to stay on IE8\nuntil our software vendor could update\n\n427\n00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.826\nthe document imaging software to\nmake sure it would run on IE9.\n\n428\n00:19:45.826 --> 00:19:48.885\nWell, if you If you're just using\nMicrosoft's update servers you don't\n\n429\n00:19:48.885 --> 00:19:50.385\nget that choice.\n\n430\n00:19:50.385 --> 00:19:53.985\nBut you can build your own update servers.\n\n431\n00:19:53.985 --> 00:19:56.095\nAnd I'm using Microsoft as an example\nbecause that's where we normally\n\n432\n00:19:56.095 --> 00:19:57.595\nsee it but it's the same in Linux.\n\n433\n00:19:57.595 --> 00:19:59.645\nYou can build your own\nRed Hat update servers,\n\n434\n00:19:59.645 --> 00:20:02.850\nit's just done through a YUM repository,\nor\n\n435\n00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:07.330\nwith Debian and Ubuntu, you can set up\nyour own app get repositories really easy.\n\n436\n00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.640\nAnd you can control what\nupdates people get.\n\n437\n00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.960\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n\n438\n00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:17.650\nWell, when I get updates in a system, so\nhere I've got, well, let me get logged in.\n\n439\n00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.380\nI've got a WSUS servers.\n\n440\n00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:25.400\nSo this is Window Server Update Services,\nand if we take a look at it, we're\n\n441\n00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.970\njust trying to make this a little more\nreasonably on my screen here, there we go.\n\n442\n00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.600\nSo I got a LAB-SERVER.\n\n443\n00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.550\nAnd it is reaching out to Microsoft and\ngetting updates.\n\n444\n00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.460\nAnd instead of having my clients and\n\n445\n00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.810\nmy servers go right to Microsoft,\nI can have my clients and\n\n446\n00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:44.880\nservers come here to my update server, and\nmy update server connects to Microsoft.\n\n447\n00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.320\nSo now it's sitting in between.\n\n448\n00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.800\nI've got an update server in\nbetween Microsoft and my clients.\n\n449\n00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:54.940\nAnd on this, I can pick and choose\nwhat gets approved, and what doesn't.\n\n450\n00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:55.880\nIf I'm not ready for\n\n451\n00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.470\neverybody to have IE 10 yet,\nI can tell it not to push out IE 10.\n\n452\n00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:05.030\nIf I'm not ready for\nsome new version of the Unity desktop, or\n\n453\n00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.510\nwhatever roll out,\nI can stop that from rolling out.\n\n454\n00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.940\nI have that choice, right?\n\n455\n00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.110\nWell, you need to do like a Red Hat\nexample, a Microsoft example.\n\n456\n00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.760\nBut the way we do it by\ncreating computer groups.\n\n457\n00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.460\nAnd normally every computer\nis treated the same.\n\n458\n00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.480\nBut you probably don't\nwant that in a minimum.\n\n459\n00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.390\nYou probably want to create\nsome different groups based on\n\n460\n00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.980\njust like the class of equipment.\n\n461\n00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:33.630\nSo I might have Production Servers.\n\n462\n00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:39.310\nAnd then, I might have on top of that,\nlike, Production Workstations.\n\n463\n00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:42.810\nSo I\"m just gonna add these.\n\n464\n00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:46.790\nYou'll probably be more aggressive with\nFeature Updates on a workstation than you\n\n465\n00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.570\nwould on a server, right?\n\n466\n00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.980\nOn a server, I need to make\nsure everything's been tested.\n\n467\n00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.760\nOn a workstation, If I have a problem,\nit affects one user.\n\n468\n00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.370\nIf I have a problem on the server,\nit affects tons of users.\n\n469\n00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.740\nBut I probably want to go\neven further that that.\n\n470\n00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:04.650\nI probably want to really break this\ndown so that I've got web servers,\n\n471\n00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:06.480\nand mail servers, and so on.\n\n472\n00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:12.560\nAnd you can create subgroups, so this\nmight be like Microsoft exchange servers,\n\n473\n00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:19.090\nand then I might create SQL servers or\n\n474\n00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:25.780\nwhatever it is that I want and I start\nbreaking that all down in here like that.\n\n475\n00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:30.920\nBy nesting groups like this,\nI can approve changes just for Exchange or\n\n476\n00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:35.720\njust for SQL, or I can approve it for\nall of the servers of the client above.\n\n477\n00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.670\nRight?\nNested groups like this makes life\n\n478\n00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.240\na lot easier to categorize and\nisolate things.\n\n479\n00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.220\nSame thing on the workstation.\n\n480\n00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.690\nI may have laptops and\ndesktops separated out, or whatever.\n\n481\n00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:53.155\nBut more importantly I need to\nhave a patch testing group.\n\n482\n00:22:53.155 --> 00:22:55.320\nPatch testing group.\n\n483\n00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.370\nThere we go.\n\n484\n00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:02.610\nAnd what the patch group is going\nto be is where I rollout updates.\n\n485\n00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:03.290\nTo test.\n\n486\n00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:05.300\nTo try them out,\nto see if it break things.\n\n487\n00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:09.290\nI might take the IT department and\na handful of specially picked\n\n488\n00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:12.860\nemployees from different departments,\nand put them in a testing group.\n\n489\n00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:17.070\nAnd when an update comes out, I can\nroll the update up to the testing group.\n\n490\n00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:20.480\nAnd when it's applied there,\nif they say everything is fine,\n\n491\n00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.350\ncouple of days go by\neverything is working great.\n\n492\n00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:27.850\nThen I can turn around and roll it out\nto the whole rest of the environment.\n\n493\n00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:28.450\nOkay.\n\n494\n00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:33.120\nWhen I pull an update, so here we can see\nall the updates that have been grabbed.\n\n495\n00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.960\nLet me just do critical ones so\nthe screen doesn't take forever to load.\n\n496\n00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:39.380\nAlthough it's apparently\ngonna take forever to load.\n\n497\n00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:39.880\nAnyway.\n\n498\n00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:45.710\nUpdate my status.\n\n499\n00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:46.520\nThere we ago.\n\n500\n00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.150\nAll right.\nSo\n\n501\n00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:49.830\nhere I can see a list of\nupdates that is pulled.\n\n502\n00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.230\nAnd when I look at these I\nmight not know what they are.\n\n503\n00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:55.620\nHey West, do you know what KB3031044 is?\n\n504\n00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.381\n&gt;&gt; No.\nSounds like a serial number of some kind.\n\n505\n00:23:58.381 --> 00:23:59.773\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if KB means knowledge base I\n\n506\n00:23:59.773 --> 00:24:00.476\nknow that one.\n\n507\n00:24:00.476 --> 00:24:02.111\nAnd the rest of it who knows?\n\n508\n00:24:02.111 --> 00:24:05.753\nSo every time Microsoft releases\na patch Figure the kb number and\n\n509\n00:24:05.753 --> 00:24:09.580\nso it does something but\nI can look it up based on that number.\n\n510\n00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:11.520\nAnd if you double click on it and\n\n511\n00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.650\nyou have the reporting stuff installed\nwhich I don't it's just the server.\n\n512\n00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.410\nThen you can pull it up and it'll\nactually give you detailed information.\n\n513\n00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.578\nI can always install the WSUS console on\nthe work station and then that would work.\n\n514\n00:24:21.578 --> 00:24:25.580\nI'm not gonna install\nthe reporting service on a server.\n\n515\n00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.040\nThe other thing I can do is\nI can do a Microsoft search.\n\n516\n00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.660\nGo to the Microsoft tech net site and\ndo a search for the kb and I can find and\n\n517\n00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.310\nfigure out what it is.\n\n518\n00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:35.549\nBut down here, I can see whether\nits got a certain severity.\n\n519\n00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:38.485\nWhether it is critical and\nI really need to get it done or not.\n\n520\n00:24:38.485 --> 00:24:40.100\nAnd then,\nI can see whether I should rolled out.\n\n521\n00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.190\nThis one actually came\nout January 13th 2015.\n\n522\n00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:44.840\nThis is an old update.\n\n523\n00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.840\nBut I need to test it, and make sure\nthat it's okay in my environment.\n\n524\n00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.600\nSo if I Approve it,\nI can approve the update, and\n\n525\n00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.740\nstart to push it out to systems.\n\n526\n00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:00.930\nOr I can Decline it and say no,\nI'm not gonna push this one out just yet.\n\n527\n00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.970\nI'm gonna sit on it and\nmaybe later I'll approve it.\n\n528\n00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:06.319\nI might decline Internet Explorer 10,\n\n529\n00:25:06.319 --> 00:25:08.460\nbecause I need to stay\non Internet Explorer 9.\n\n530\n00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:12.140\nBut I'll approve all the IE 9 updates so\nmy systems stay up to date.\n\n531\n00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:16.377\nAnd when I go to Approve it,\nI can pick the groups.\n\n532\n00:25:16.377 --> 00:25:20.140\nAnd so I'm gonna Approve this just for\npatch testing.\n\n533\n00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.030\nAnd I'm gonna Approve it for install.\n\n534\n00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.490\nSo I can approve for\nremoval or not approved.\n\n535\n00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.860\nI'm gonna approve for install there.\n\n536\n00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:31.330\nBut on my other groups I might want to\ncome through and say that is not approved.\n\n537\n00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.210\nI don't really have to.\n\n538\n00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:34.695\nThe inherited value is not approved.\n\n539\n00:25:34.695 --> 00:25:36.668\nThat' kinda what it's at by default.\n\n540\n00:25:36.668 --> 00:25:41.680\nAnd so now, anybody in the patch\ntesting group is gonna get that update.\n\n541\n00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.480\nAnd I can monitor and see what happens.\n\n542\n00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.930\nIt works out great, wonderful.\n\n543\n00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:48.230\nIf it doesn't work out great,\nI didn't effect everybody else.\n\n544\n00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:52.271\nAnd then, once I decide it's okay for\neverybody then I can come back up here.\n\n545\n00:25:52.271 --> 00:25:54.370\nAnd I can approve it all\nthe way up at the parent.\n\n546\n00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.350\nAnd it will trickle down and\neverybody will get that update.\n\n547\n00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:00.710\nSo it's a way for\nme to step in between and control that.\n\n548\n00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:03.770\nNow, when I talk all these updates\nthey fall in a couple of categories.\n\n549\n00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:07.550\nMostly, what I'm looking at here\nbecause I'm in Microsoft WSUS,\n\n550\n00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.320\nthese are going to be\noperating system updates.\n\n551\n00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.690\nUpdates from Windows Server 2012, right?\n\n552\n00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:16.588\nBut you can get software updates\nlike from Microsoft exchange and\n\n553\n00:26:16.588 --> 00:26:19.063\nSequel or\nany third party software you run.\n\n554\n00:26:19.063 --> 00:26:20.621\nYou might not be able to manage\nit through this software.\n\n555\n00:26:20.621 --> 00:26:21.691\nYou might have to use something else for\nit.\n\n556\n00:26:21.691 --> 00:26:23.810\nBut they get updates too.\n\n557\n00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.710\nSo third party software applications,\n\n558\n00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.630\nany of those kinds of programs\nthat you run, they'll get updates.\n\n559\n00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.870\nBut the key thing to pay attention\nto are going to be security updates.\n\n560\n00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:35.820\nIt is so important that you roll out\nsecurity updates as fast as possible.\n\n561\n00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:36.860\nIf a new update comes out for\n\n562\n00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:42.300\nMicrosoft Word, that has the ability to\nprint labels on a printer or something.\n\n563\n00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.360\nI'm not in a hurry to deploy that.\n\n564\n00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:49.690\nBut if it patches a full administrator\ncompromise that's remotely executable,\n\n565\n00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:52.320\nI need to patch that right away,\non all my machines.\n\n566\n00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.890\nSo your testing window,\nmight only be one hour.\n\n567\n00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:57.020\nIt might be a short, short test.\n\n568\n00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.750\nNormally, I like to test for a week.\n\n569\n00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.560\nBut if it's a critical security update,\n\n570\n00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.560\nwe'll probably rule that\none out pretty fast.\n\n571\n00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.570\nEven without testing in some scenarios.\n\n572\n00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:07.080\nIf its that urgent like\nwhen heart bleed came out.\n\n573\n00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.340\nIt was that urgent you just rolled it out.\n\n574\n00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:12.410\nYou rather have the site go down\nthan be vulnerable to heart bleed.\n\n575\n00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:16.970\nTo have that choice was so\nit just depends on the environment.\n\n576\n00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.310\nDon't forget there's other updates.\n\n577\n00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.000\nUpdates that don't work here in software.\n\n578\n00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.340\nLike our hardware updates, you have\nfirmware, your BIOS, your raid controller,\n\n579\n00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.380\nyour chip set they all get updates too.\n\n580\n00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.880\nSometimes it's just a driver\nyou download which you'll get\n\n581\n00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.030\nfrom a software update\nsystem a lot of times.\n\n582\n00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:38.201\nOther times, it's actual firmware, where\nyou've gotta take the server offline and\n\n583\n00:27:38.201 --> 00:27:39.697\nboot off a USB key or whatever.\n\n584\n00:27:39.697 --> 00:27:41.810\nTo flash the firmware for that device.\n\n585\n00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:44.470\nYou need to make sure you're\nmaintaining and checking those two.\n\n586\n00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:47.620\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, what if it is something like a\ndevice trouble update that I've got to do.\n\n587\n00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:51.460\nAnd I'm not exactly sure, do you I\nhave compatible machines with this,\n\n588\n00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:56.200\nshould I even apply this,\nlet's say one machine over the other?\n\n589\n00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.150\nIs there information that I can\ngo to find out if that update\n\n590\n00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:04.465\nof any kind is applicable to\nthe machine that's in question?\n\n591\n00:28:04.465 --> 00:28:09.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Absolutely, and this is where\nwe diverge really bad from home users.\n\n592\n00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.960\nHome users don't care, right?\n\n593\n00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.000\nIt's an update, I'll Apply it, and video,\nit has an update for the video card.\n\n594\n00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:15.910\nI'm just gonna throw it on.\n\n595\n00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:17.550\nWho cares?\n\n596\n00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.260\nBut in the server world,\nthings are different.\n\n597\n00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:23.900\nIn the server world HPE, Lenovo, Dell,\n\n598\n00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:29.943\nthey're focused on your server\nstaying online as much as possible.\n\n599\n00:28:29.943 --> 00:28:34.275\nAnd as a result they get very\ninvolved with Microsoft and\n\n600\n00:28:34.275 --> 00:28:36.683\nwith RedHat, and Canonical.\n\n601\n00:28:36.683 --> 00:28:39.339\nAnd each of the different companies that\nare out there that are making these server\n\n602\n00:28:39.339 --> 00:28:41.020\noperating systems they support.\n\n603\n00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:44.940\nAnd making sure that updates\nare put up in timely fashion and\n\n604\n00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.360\nother directly compatible\nwith your hardware.\n\n605\n00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:52.160\nSo, when an update comes out,\nyour usually safe.\n\n606\n00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.560\nYou've usually know if you\ngot one of those vendors.\n\n607\n00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.260\nBut if build your own server.\n\n608\n00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.370\nWhich there is a place to do Google.\n\n609\n00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:02.560\nGoogle uses entirely self built servers\nfor all, and run a thousands of server and\n\n610\n00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.640\nthey know what they're doing.\n\n611\n00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.120\nThey self build.\n\n612\n00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.690\nWell, for them, they have to use hardware\nthat is supported by the vendors.\n\n613\n00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.750\nSo for example, Microsoft has what\nused to be called the Windows Hardware\n\n614\n00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:16.800\nQuality Labs, or WHQL, which is now\njust called the Windows Server Catalog.\n\n615\n00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.280\nAnd the Windows Server Catalog,\nI get choked up, so\n\n616\n00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.750\nemotional about the server catalog.\n\n617\n00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:25.922\nWhat the server catalog does is it\ngives you a list of software and\n\n618\n00:29:25.922 --> 00:29:29.565\nhardware that is approved or\nin testing to be approved.\n\n619\n00:29:29.565 --> 00:29:32.395\nTo be certified for use of Windows Server.\n\n620\n00:29:32.395 --> 00:29:34.640\nRedHat has a similar compatibility list.\n\n621\n00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.910\nCanonical has a similar\ncompatibility list.\n\n622\n00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:38.440\nApple, well Apple, sort of does.\n\n623\n00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.570\nI mean they make their own hardware,\nso it's easy for them.\n\n624\n00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:43.130\nBut they still have particular\nmodels if you're gonna run the OS X\n\n625\n00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.790\nserver functionality.\n\n626\n00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:46.930\nIt's only supported on certain models.\n\n627\n00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:52.590\nSo we can come here and\nmake sure that our hardware is approved.\n\n628\n00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:57.770\nAnd if it is, then what this tells us is\nwhenever Microsoft creates an update,\n\n629\n00:29:57.770 --> 00:29:58.730\nthey've tested it.\n\n630\n00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:00.590\nThey've tested it against\nthe hardware that we have.\n\n631\n00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:03.980\nThey've tested if certified their\noperating system for that hardware.\n\n632\n00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.510\nAnd we know we are gonna\nhave good compatibility.\n\n633\n00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:07.550\nThis is gonna work out well, all right.\n\n634\n00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:10.080\nWhere it gets really tricky is when you\nstart bringing software into the mix.\n\n635\n00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.300\nSo for\nexample if you're doing clustering for\n\n636\n00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:17.236\nMicrosoft, they have a hardware validation\nprocess for the fail over cluster.\n\n637\n00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.260\nFailover clusters are for\nmissing critical systems.\n\n638\n00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.630\nIf one server fails,\nanother one is right there taking over.\n\n639\n00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:24.920\nThe end users never didn't even notice it.\n\n640\n00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.910\nIt's awesome technology.\n\n641\n00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.230\nWe'll see it later in this series.\n\n642\n00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.010\nBut if you're gonna try and\n\n643\n00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:33.540\ncreate that environment, you need to\nknow that your hardware is stable.\n\n644\n00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.650\nThat it's not just stuff\nyou ordered off in eBay and\n\n645\n00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:39.700\nthrew together,\nthat you're using reliable components.\n\n646\n00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.180\nSo Microsoft does\na hardware validation and\n\n647\n00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.960\nso to wizard through\nthat runs on your system.\n\n648\n00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.570\nIt inventories all the hardware and\nruns it against Microsoft's database.\n\n649\n00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.819\nAnd if it's not approved,\nit will still let you build a cluster.\n\n650\n00:30:49.819 --> 00:30:50.906\nYou can do it.\n\n651\n00:30:50.906 --> 00:30:54.749\nBut if you get a nice little warning on\nthe screen and it will tell you, hey,\n\n652\n00:30:54.749 --> 00:30:57.448\nif you ever call us for\nsupport, we can't help you.\n\n653\n00:30:57.448 --> 00:31:01.070\nCuz your hardware is not compatible,\nit's not on the authorized list.\n\n654\n00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.992\nIn my work, fine,\nit might be a great hardware.\n\n655\n00:31:02.992 --> 00:31:05.578\nBut we haven't tested it,\nso we can't help you.\n\n656\n00:31:05.578 --> 00:31:09.100\nAnd that's not what you want\non a mission critical system.\n\n657\n00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.030\nIt's worth it to pay a little more and\n\n658\n00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:14.240\nget the legitimate hardware that's\nbeen tested and authorized.\n\n659\n00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.100\nAnd if you call HPE and\nstart ordering service and telling,\n\n660\n00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.060\nI'm gonna be doing a fail over cluster,\nthey won't let you know.\n\n661\n00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:22.650\nOkay, all of our service are approved or\nwell,\n\n662\n00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:25.370\nyou wanna stay away from these couple of\nservice, they're really low end anyway.\n\n663\n00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.720\nThese are the ones that you wanna stick\nwith they are all on the approved list.\n\n664\n00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.420\nSo, you wanna make sure that you get stuff\nthat is approved, that is out there.\n\n665\n00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.720\nThe operating system has to get tested\nwith the hardware in conjunction,\n\n666\n00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.860\nthe two work together.\n\n667\n00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.940\nAnd if anything doesnt quiet work\nyou could end up with some really\n\n668\n00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.360\nweird scenarios.\n\n669\n00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.315\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, well that's\na lot of really good information.\n\n670\n00:31:42.315 --> 00:31:44.128\nAnd I'll tell you what\nwe've got a lot more to go.\n\n671\n00:31:44.128 --> 00:31:47.264\nCuz when it goes to server maintenance\nit's an important concept and\n\n672\n00:31:47.264 --> 00:31:49.710\nthere are a lot of topics\nassociated with it.\n\n673\n00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:50.710\nBut Don unfortunately,\n\n674\n00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:52.680\nit doesn't look like we have\nany minutes left on the clock.\n\n675\n00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.770\nBut before we do sign out do you have any\nadditional words you might like to tell\n\n676\n00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:56.830\nour viewers?\n\n677\n00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:58.270\n&gt;&gt; We do have a lot more to get to,\n\n678\n00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.840\na ton I think we're less than\nquarter of the way through it.\n\n679\n00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.180\nBut I started with change management\ncuz it's probably the most boring.\n\n680\n00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.830\nAnd I know a lot of you\nprobably don't like it,\n\n681\n00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.400\nbut it has saved my butt more than once.\n\n682\n00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.180\nSooner or later it will save yours too.\n\n683\n00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:15.770\nSo, definitely embrace it, appreciate the\nvalue that it creates and make use of it.\n\n684\n00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:18.970\nIf you don't have change management in\nyour organization, you really need it.\n\n685\n00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:21.185\nSo, definitely look to\nimplement that soon.\n\n686\n00:32:21.185 --> 00:32:21.695\n&gt;&gt; Alright Don.\n\n687\n00:32:21.695 --> 00:32:23.835\nWe appreciate you being in\nthe studio here with us.\n\n688\n00:32:23.835 --> 00:32:25.135\nWe're looking forward to a part two.\n\n689\n00:32:25.135 --> 00:32:27.345\nAnd we appreciate you the viewer for\nwatching.\n\n690\n00:32:27.345 --> 00:32:30.165\nSinging out for\nIT PRO

watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello and\n\n4\n00:00:09.118 --> 00:00:15.190\nwelcome to another great episode here\nat ITProTV, I'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n5\n00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.610\nin today's episode we've got\nmore great server plus compties.\n\n6\n00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.650\nWhat is SK0004 certification and\njoining us back in the studios for\n\n7\n00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.790\na part two on server maintenance\nis none other than Mr. Don Pizzet.\n\n8\n00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.040\nDon, how are you doing sir?\n\n9\n00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.910\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.400\nReady to dive back into Server Plus and\ncover a not so happy topic today.\n\n11\n00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.960\nWhat we're gonna be talking\nabout is downtime and outages.\n\n12\n00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.150\nTwo things that we definitely\ndon't like to have happen.\n\n13\n00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.820\nWe really don't want to be the people who\nhave to deal with them but they do happen,\n\n14\n00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.280\nand what we can do about it is kinda\nimportant because when things aren't\n\n15\n00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.600\nworking the way they're suppose to and the\nsystem goes down, what's going to happen?\n\n16\n00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.200\nYou're world becomes a living nightmare.\n\n17\n00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.850\nPeople are harassing you, trying to find\nout when system's gonna be back out.\n\n18\n00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.290\nWhat happened and they just want\nthings to work as fast as possible.\n\n19\n00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.230\nAnd it takes time to repair sometimes,\nright?\n\n20\n00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.770\nSo we've gotta kinda go through a process\nand understand what's involved with that.\n\n21\n00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.700\nSo we're gonna take a look at some of the\ndifferent elements that are involved with\n\n22\n00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.240\ndowntime and outages and some of\nthe things we can do to prevent them,\n\n23\n00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.520\nto make sure that doesn't happen to us.\n\n24\n00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.000\nBut you really do need to plan for\nthem happening.\n\n25\n00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.980\nIt absolutely happens.\n\n26\n00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.550\nIt doesn't matter how\nbig your company is or\n\n27\n00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.020\nhow great your product is,\neverybody has downtime sooner or later.\n\n28\n00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.240\nAnd the way you reacted is what\ndefines a good IT technician\n\n29\n00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.260\nversus the bad one and you'll find\nthe good ones have a plan in place and\n\n30\n00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.724\nready to rock in the face of adversity and\nthat's where we want to be.\n\n31\n00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:40.510\nAll right, let's keep this thing off,\n\n32\n00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.813\nthe first thing I want to talk\nabout is scheduled downtime.\n\n33\n00:01:43.813 --> 00:01:44.523\nAll right?\n\n34\n00:01:44.523 --> 00:01:46.292\nEverybody has downtime.\n\n35\n00:01:46.292 --> 00:01:48.120\nDowntime happens sooner or\n\n36\n00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.419\nlater every system has to be\ntaken off sooner or later.\n\n37\n00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.000\nIt's hard to update the BIOS\nof a server while its online.\n\n38\n00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.710\nIt's hard to update the kernel\nof a Linux box while its online.\n\n39\n00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.870\nIt's hard to update anything in\nthe Windows box while its online.\n\n40\n00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.920\nThere are systems that have to be\ntaken offline just to do updates.\n\n41\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.310\nSo now, we're not talking\nabout a failed component or\n\n42\n00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.800\npoor planning on your part or whatever.\n\n43\n00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.420\nJust routine updates.\n\n44\n00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.700\nIf everything is running 100% perfectly,\nand a security update comes out.\n\n45\n00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.100\nLet's say you have a Red Hat Box, right?\n\n46\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.230\nSo Red Hat Enterprise Linux,\nand a kernel update comes out.\n\n47\n00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.930\nWell you can deploy the kernel update\nright now while the server's online.\n\n48\n00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.280\nBut it's not gonna use it.\n\n49\n00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.560\nIt's not gonna use it until you reboot.\n\n50\n00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.440\nYou've gotta reboot the server.\n\n51\n00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.180\nSo when you reboot the server,\nwhat happens?\n\n52\n00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.488\nThe server goes offline for\na minute, right?\n\n53\n00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:36.220\nThat happens.\n\n54\n00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.250\nIt's the nature, the beast.\n\n55\n00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.347\nNow, if you are in a business like ours,\n\n56\n00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:43.020\nwell I can schedule a reboot\nlike that any weekend.\n\n57\n00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.210\nWe don't film on the weekends.\n\n58\n00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.290\nAnd so Reboot.\n\n59\n00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.390\nNo big deal, nobody notices.\n\n60\n00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.400\nBut if you're in a hospital, providing\n24 hour a day 7 day a week service\n\n61\n00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.070\nto patients, who in many cases have their\nlife threatened by some kind of injury,\n\n62\n00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.530\nyou can't go offline ever, at all.\n\n63\n00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.070\nBut if I have to reboot to apply a kernel\nupdate, what in the world does that mean?\n\n64\n00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.770\nDoes that mean that I can't\napply kernel updates?\n\n65\n00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.120\nYou could take that approach\nas many people would do.\n\n66\n00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.160\nBut no, the solution is you need to find\nways to implement your technologies.\n\n67\n00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.080\nSo that you can take a server offline And\nnobody will notice, right?\n\n68\n00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.720\nAnd it doesn't even have to be that hard.\n\n69\n00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.440\nIf you have a web server, get two of them.\n\n70\n00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.670\nGet two web servers.\n\n71\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.330\nAnd if you're load balancing traffic\nacross the two web servers and\n\n72\n00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.800\nyou take one offline,\neverybody just goes to the other one.\n\n73\n00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.660\nAnd then once the first one\ncomes back online again,\n\n74\n00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.680\nyou're back in business right?\n\n75\n00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.920\nPeople are distributed.\n\n76\n00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.480\nBecause you had more than one Web Server\neven when they are running perfectly\n\n77\n00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.610\nthey are gonna be times they\nneed to go offline, and\n\n78\n00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.330\nthat is called schedule downtime.\n\n79\n00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.340\nThe next time of our down time is\nyou get to pick when it happens, so\n\n80\n00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.050\nI can say I want to update this Server,\nso I'm gonna have to reboot it.\n\n81\n00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.130\nWhat is the lowest activity time?\n\n82\n00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.950\nSo let me look at my performance reports,\nand\n\n83\n00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.097\nsee when the least amount of\nusers are on the website.\n\n84\n00:04:03.097 --> 00:04:06.440\nAll right, so\nit looks like Thursdays between 1 am and\n\n85\n00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.560\n2 am is the lowest usage\nrate on my website.\n\n86\n00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.370\nThat's when I'll do the update.\n\n87\n00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.180\nI can code over to one\nserver instead of two,\n\n88\n00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.580\nnobody will even notice because everybody\ncan fit in easily on one server.\n\n89\n00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.750\nAnd then you go and\nyou do the update, right?\n\n90\n00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.170\nScheduled downtime is where we plan for\nthe outage.\n\n91\n00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.930\nAnd it usually centers around updates.\n\n92\n00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.990\nBut it could be installing new systems.\n\n93\n00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.490\nIt could be migrating to new hardware.\n\n94\n00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.090\nIt could just be something else, like for\nexample, maybe not even server related.\n\n95\n00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.180\nMaybe the air conditioning technicians\nneed to come in and work on the AC unit.\n\n96\n00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.290\nAC units need to be serviced every so\noften.\n\n97\n00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.960\nSo I'm gonna have to\ntake the servers down,\n\n98\n00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.970\nbecause the air conditioning's not\ngonna be running while they service it.\n\n99\n00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.040\nOr maybe it's disaster recovery testing.\n\n100\n00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.480\nHey, I'm gonna take the headquarters down,\n\n101\n00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.300\ncuz we're gonna fail over to the DR site,\nand test that out.\n\n102\n00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.535\nSo I need to plan for\nthat down time, right?\n\n103\n00:04:54.535 --> 00:04:55.450\nScheduled outages.\n\n104\n00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.860\nBut the unscheduled ones, those are the\nones that, they can either result in\n\n105\n00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.760\nyou getting paid more, or\nthey can result in you getting fired.\n\n106\n00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.600\nSo unscheduled outages are when\nsomething goes wrong, and\n\n107\n00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.650\npeople can't access the services anymore.\n\n108\n00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.790\nThat can be really bad in some scenarios.\n\n109\n00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.960\nFor example, I worked at a bank, and\nat the bank, if our account management\n\n110\n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.150\nsystem went down, we had tellers\nall across the four state area that\n\n111\n00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.930\ncouldn't do cash withdrawals and deposit\nbecause they couldn't get into the system.\n\n112\n00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.550\nSo we had hundreds of employees\nsitting there doing nothing.\n\n113\n00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.760\nAnytime that system went offline.\n\n114\n00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.130\nSo we didn't want that to happen.\n\n115\n00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.040\nIf we scheduled it we'd schedule it for\ntimes when the banks were closed.\n\n116\n00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.270\nBut if it was unscheduled.\n\n117\n00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.020\nIf it happened in the middle of the day?\n\n118\n00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.710\nWe'd have to focus\n\n119\n00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.960\nall of our efforts on getting that\nback online as soon as we could.\n\n120\n00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.480\nBecause meanwhile,\nthe company's losing money.\n\n121\n00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.130\nThe company's losing money\ncuz it can't take deposits.\n\n122\n00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.800\nIt's losing money because there's\nemployees that are there on the time clock\n\n123\n00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.350\nnot doing any work.\n\n124\n00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.550\nAnd it's losing money\nbecause the customers see it.\n\n125\n00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.250\nI can't get my money out?\n\n126\n00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.420\nYou know what?\nI better move my money to another bank.\n\n127\n00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.060\nWhere I can get it, right?\n\n128\n00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.940\nSo that's bad.\n\n129\n00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.920\nThat's a public relations\nhit that you take.\n\n130\n00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.980\nIt's kind of like an unseen\ncost of having an outage.\n\n131\n00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.360\nThat stuff's bad.\n\n132\n00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.770\nTake Amazon as an example.\n\n133\n00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.650\nAmazon's, I read an article it was part\nof the earnings report a few years ago.\n\n134\n00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.610\nThat they do over $1\nmillion in sales per hour.\n\n135\n00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.570\nEvery hour over a million\ndollars in sales.\n\n136\n00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.830\nNow, that's not profit, right?\n\n137\n00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.680\nBut still a million\ndollars is a ton of money.\n\n138\n00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.610\nIf their site went down for\n\n139\n00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.650\nan hour, that would be a million\ndollar in sales they would lose.\n\n140\n00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:35.960\nThat's bad.\n\n141\n00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.110\nAnd so you're darn right that Amazon has\nplanned for that not to happen, right?\n\n142\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.210\nPlanned an infrastructure that is so\nrobust and resilient\n\n143\n00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.590\nthat they can have numerous failures all\nthroughout and still be online just fine.\n\n144\n00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.550\nThat's actually, that's how AWS started,\nthe Amazon Web Services.\n\n145\n00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.650\nAmazon had so much infrastructure that was\nso stable that a lot of it didn't need.\n\n146\n00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.250\nAnd so they started renting it out to\nother people so they could use it.\n\n147\n00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.780\nAnd now as they grown and grown and\n\n148\n00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.480\ngrown that's turned into\na full fledged business.\n\n149\n00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.210\nThe whole AWS product\nmakes a ton of money.\n\n150\n00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.470\nOff of stuff they were already doing.\n\n151\n00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.920\n&gt;&gt; Don is there any way or any kind of\ntechnique that I might be able to generate\n\n152\n00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.340\nsome kind of metrics and know that I'm\ngonna lose a million dollars an hour.\n\n153\n00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.670\nWether this should be\nscheduled maybe during the,\n\n154\n00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.390\nwell I guess if your like game is on,\nyou don't have.\n\n155\n00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.270\nHave any down time but if I'm,\n\n156\n00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.960\nmaybe another small company and\nI know that it's gonna impact me.\n\n157\n00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.580\nMaybe right here or\nsomething is gonna cause a problem.\n\n158\n00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.300\nDo I have some kind of technique\nthat can generate matrix for that?\n\n159\n00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the age old question that any\nCIO, any Chief Information Officer is\n\n160\n00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.065\ngonna ask is\n&gt;&gt; How much should I invest in redundancy?\n\n161\n00:07:40.065 --> 00:07:42.796\nRight?\nIf I had a server, and for redundancy\n\n162\n00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:47.962\npurposes I buy a second one, that's server\njust cost me twice as much, all right?\n\n163\n00:07:47.962 --> 00:07:49.680\nI had to pay twice as much to\nthat server for redundancy.\n\n164\n00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.760\nThere's a dollar value assigned to that.\n\n165\n00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.022\nLet's say it's a $6,000 server.\n\n166\n00:07:54.022 --> 00:07:57.949\nWell, that $6,000 server now costs me\n$12,000, cuz I had to buy 2 of them for\n\n167\n00:07:57.949 --> 00:07:58.567\nredundancy.\n\n168\n00:07:58.567 --> 00:08:02.651\nWell, what were the odds of that\nserver failing in the first place?\n\n169\n00:08:02.651 --> 00:08:06.079\nIf it failed,\nthen I'll want that second one.\n\n170\n00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:10.060\nBut if it never fails,\ndo I need that second one?\n\n171\n00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.130\nWhat are the odds of that server failing?\n\n172\n00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:13.700\nWe need to know that.\n\n173\n00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.385\nThat's a metric,\nit's something that can be tracked.\n\n174\n00:08:16.385 --> 00:08:20.060\nYou have this MTBF,\nMean Time Between Failure.\n\n175\n00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.640\nThat a lot of venders will publish.\n\n176\n00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.480\nThe numbers are almost always garbage,\nso you can't truly trust them.\n\n177\n00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.690\nI normally base it on the warranties.\n\n178\n00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.700\nIf they're offering three year\nwarranties on the equipment,\n\n179\n00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.160\nthat means they expect it to run\nwithout fail for three years.\n\n180\n00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.910\nSome systems will only run two years or\none year before having a failure.\n\n181\n00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:39.155\nSome might go four or\nfive years without having a failure.\n\n182\n00:08:39.155 --> 00:08:42.200\nBut that three year is what they're\ngambling on as being the best number.\n\n183\n00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.150\nAnd you know they did\nthe math on it because\n\n184\n00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.910\nthey're the ones backing it\nup with a warranty, right?\n\n185\n00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.650\nThere's some people that will sell you\na server with a five-year warranty.\n\n186\n00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.389\nHP will do it, Dell will do it.\n\n187\n00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:53.850\nThey'll give you a five-year warranty.\n\n188\n00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:55.210\nThat means they're really confident.\n\n189\n00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.698\nYou can go five years without a failure.\n\n190\n00:08:56.698 --> 00:09:01.100\nAll right, so you might not\nbother with that second server.\n\n191\n00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.850\nBecause you know it'll take so\nlong for a failure.\n\n192\n00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.840\nAnd if you're gonna replace\nthe server every two years anyway,\n\n193\n00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.530\nthen maybe you don't need that second one,\nright?\n\n194\n00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.760\nThe other thing to think about\nthough is what if it does fail?\n\n195\n00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.810\nAll right, it fails.\n\n196\n00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.480\nHow's that impact the company?\n\n197\n00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.270\nIf the second server is $6,000 and\n\n198\n00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:23.670\nthe first server fails and I don't have a\nsecond server, what's that gonna cost me?\n\n199\n00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:28.350\nCuz if it cost me less than $6,000,\nthen I'm not gonna bother with it.\n\n200\n00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:32.581\nI'm not gonna bother with buying that\nsecond server because the outage will be\n\n201\n00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:35.170\nlower in cost than this\nsecond server would be.\n\n202\n00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.800\nAnd there's two calculations we\nneed to be aware of on this.\n\n203\n00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.410\nOne is what's called a BIA or\nbusiness impact analysis.\n\n204\n00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.890\nAn impact analysis is where\nthey look at the system and\n\n205\n00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.060\nit's not normally based on a server.\n\n206\n00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.360\nIt's based on the software,\nthe service that you're providing.\n\n207\n00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.420\nSo look at the service and they say\nif this service became unavailable,\n\n208\n00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.350\nwhat would it cost you the company?\n\n209\n00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.840\nIn terms of actual money,\nin terms of lost productivity,\n\n210\n00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.050\nlost revenue and lost public image.\n\n211\n00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.430\nSo what financial value would\nbe associated with that?\n\n212\n00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.710\nAnd they can calculate it out per hour or\neven per minute sometimes.\n\n213\n00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.810\nHow much you're going to be losing.\n\n214\n00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.880\nAnd you can use that as a way to gauge\nhow much money you should be spending.\n\n215\n00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.927\nHey, it's gonna always\nbe like a $1,200 hit.\n\n216\n00:10:18.927 --> 00:10:21.790\nThat doesn't mean buy a second server for\n$6,000.\n\n217\n00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:27.430\nThat means spend less than $1,200\nto try and mitigate that risk.\n\n218\n00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.150\nTry and\nminimize it as much as you can, right?\n\n219\n00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:34.192\nThe other thing is what's called\nan MTTR or a mean time to repair.\n\n220\n00:10:34.192 --> 00:10:35.575\nMean time between failure,\n\n221\n00:10:35.575 --> 00:10:39.560\nthat's how long a piece of equipment can\nrun on average without failing, right?\n\n222\n00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.770\nYou're gonna have some outliers but\nhow much we can normally expect.\n\n223\n00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:48.740\nMTTR is once a failure happens, what's\nthe average for us to actually repair it?\n\n224\n00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.510\nHow long is it gonna take to fix it?\n\n225\n00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.970\nIf I have a server with a failed hard\ndrive, how long does it take for\n\n226\n00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:54.350\nme to fix that hard drive?\n\n227\n00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.970\nWell, if I bought a spare hard drive and\n\n228\n00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.110\nin the system is a hot spare,\nthe MTTR is zero.\n\n229\n00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.590\nIt immediately kicks in and\nstarts repairing.\n\n230\n00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.623\nWell, I guess you have to\ncount the repair time.\n\n231\n00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:09.460\nIf it's RAID 5, the build up might take\nawhile, so you'd have to count that too.\n\n232\n00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.200\nIf I bought the hard drive but\nit's a cold spare,\n\n233\n00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.420\nit's sitting on a rack,\nI've gotta find out about the problem.\n\n234\n00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.268\nWalk over to the rack, grab the drive,\npop it in the servers.\n\n235\n00:11:17.268 --> 00:11:21.370\nSo my MTTR is much, much well,\nI'm gonna say longer from zero, but\n\n236\n00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:22.070\nit's not that long.\n\n237\n00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.620\nA couple of minutes,\nmaybe ten or 15 minutes, right.\n\n238\n00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.950\nBut if I don't have an extra\nhard drive and I just say look,\n\n239\n00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.340\nthe server's under warranty.\n\n240\n00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.800\nSo if the hard drive fails, I call in\na warranty ticket and Dell or Lenovo, HP,\n\n241\n00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.410\nwhoever, they send me a drive, okay?\n\n242\n00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.150\nGreat.\n\n243\n00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.030\nWell, how long's that\nwarranty ticket gonna take?\n\n244\n00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.040\nTwo days, four days?\n\n245\n00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.110\nWhen you buy a warranty,\nthey'll ask you to pick a window time.\n\n246\n00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:48.010\nThey'll ask you to pick,\ndo you want next day service?\n\n247\n00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:51.980\nIn other words, you'll have the part\nyou need the very next day 24 hours.\n\n248\n00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.920\nOr do you want same day service?\n\n249\n00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.980\nDell is always big for\npushing the four-hour response time.\n\n250\n00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.970\nYou have the part you\nneed within four hours.\n\n251\n00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.270\nOkay, so my physical server might fail.\n\n252\n00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.060\nBut I know I can get any part\nI need within four hours.\n\n253\n00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.180\nSo do I buy a second server?\n\n254\n00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:13.960\nIf I'm okay with four hours or less\ndowntime, I don't buy the second server.\n\n255\n00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.260\nBut if I can't have four hours down time,\nI need to be up, I buy the second server.\n\n256\n00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.490\nThat's how we make those choices.\n\n257\n00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.830\nThat's how we start to mitigate this.\n\n258\n00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:26.180\nAnd one might have unscheduled downtime,\nbecause the MTTR,\n\n259\n00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.260\nthe mean time to repair is small enough,\nI'm okay with it.\n\n260\n00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.660\nAnd yeah, my end users might see that and\n\n261\n00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.870\nthey may not be able to get to the site or\nwhatever.\n\n262\n00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.180\nBut they give up on it and they try\nagain that evening and it works fine.\n\n263\n00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.330\nCuz it was only down for\nfour hours, right?\n\n264\n00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.600\nThat's where we have to gauge our impact.\n\n265\n00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.010\nThe impact on our business.\n\n266\n00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.920\nBusiness impact analysis does that.\n\n267\n00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.740\nJust looks at the financial and\n\n268\n00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.834\nother consequences related\nto having [INAUDIBLE].\n\n269\n00:12:50.834 --> 00:12:57.460\nAll right, the other thing is we need\nto determine when we notify the users.\n\n270\n00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:01.090\nIf you have outage that\nis microsecond in size.\n\n271\n00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.560\nIf it just happens really briefly, you\nmight choose not to notify your clients.\n\n272\n00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.080\nNo, I'm not gonna be telling them,\nit's just gonna be really fast,\n\n273\n00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.070\nnobody will notice, right?\n\n274\n00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.630\nOr you might say look, we can do\nextended maintenance this weekend,\n\n275\n00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.738\nwe're gonna take servers offline for\nsix hours.\n\n276\n00:13:15.738 --> 00:13:19.430\nSo let's e-mail all the customers and\ntell them hey guys,\n\n277\n00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.120\nthe services are going to be unavailable\nduring this time and this time.\n\n278\n00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.310\nScheduled maintenance or whatever, right.\n\n279\n00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:25.800\nIf it's unscheduled maintenance.\n\n280\n00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.700\nIf it's something happening out of\nthe blue, the servers are offline,\n\n281\n00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.390\nhow long do you wait before you notify\nyour end users to give them a story.\n\n282\n00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.170\nNot a made up story, but\na real story, like what's going on.\n\n283\n00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.530\nThey wanna know.\n\n284\n00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.458\nWhy is the site offline?\n\n285\n00:13:37.458 --> 00:13:38.970\nAre they out of business?\n\n286\n00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:39.540\nMaybe.\n\n287\n00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.040\nThey get attack by a terrorist?\n\n288\n00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.670\nMaybe.\n\n289\n00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.770\nDid they get bought out by somebody\nelse like clothing or what.\n\n290\n00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:45.960\nWhat's going on?\n\n291\n00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.040\nThey don't know.\n\n292\n00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.350\nAnd then you just have this habit of\nmaking the wrong stories always far worst\n\n293\n00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.210\nthan the reality.\n\n294\n00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.130\nSo at some point we have to\nsent out our communication.\n\n295\n00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.420\nBut what if we don't know\nwhat is issue is yet.\n\n296\n00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.810\nThe servers are offline and\nwe don't know why.\n\n297\n00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.570\nWhat do we communicate?\n\n298\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:01.200\nMaybe we don't.\n\n299\n00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.620\nMaybe we just wait and wait and wait.\n\n300\n00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.210\nAnd the customers start coming up with\nthese crazy stories about all sorts\n\n301\n00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.260\nof this stuff.\n\n302\n00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.970\nBut eventually we do need to communicate\nit out, whether we know or not.\n\n303\n00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:13.360\nAnd so ahead of time, you need to\nhave a communication response plan.\n\n304\n00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.320\nAnd there's what's called\nan incidence response plan.\n\n305\n00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.880\nAnd it's used for when hackers break in,\nor the air conditioner breaks,\n\n306\n00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.250\nor building fire, or inclement weather.\n\n307\n00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.380\nAny number of things.\n\n308\n00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.250\nInstant response covers all that.\n\n309\n00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.410\nPeople think hackers today cuz\nthat's all the news reports on, but\n\n310\n00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:27.840\neverything else is important too.\n\n311\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.207\nSo instant reports are gonna wrap that up.\n\n312\n00:14:30.207 --> 00:14:33.911\nAnd then your instant response plan,\nyou're gonna indicate when do I\n\n313\n00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:37.820\ncommunicate with the customers or\nwho makes that decision, right?\n\n314\n00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.090\nIs it the CEO?\n\n315\n00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:40.810\nDo you have a PR person?\n\n316\n00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:41.660\nIs it the CI?\n\n317\n00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.935\nWho makes that decision and\ndrafts up that document,\n\n318\n00:14:44.935 --> 00:14:48.155\nit's gonna be sent out to the users\nto let them know what's going on.\n\n319\n00:14:48.155 --> 00:14:51.062\n&gt;&gt; Don, let's see if this is\nan example of client notification.\n\n320\n00:14:51.062 --> 00:14:52.605\nI know an AWS.\n\n321\n00:14:52.605 --> 00:14:58.145\nI know prior to Intune being\nwrapped up in Office 365 and\n\n322\n00:14:58.145 --> 00:15:00.725\ndifferent cloud based platforms.\n\n323\n00:15:00.725 --> 00:15:04.165\nWhen they're about to maybe roll out\na feature or roll out an update,\n\n324\n00:15:04.165 --> 00:15:09.310\nyou can usually check out a specific site,\na location within their webpage.\n\n325\n00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.250\nThat shows you those scheduled\ntimes when they're gonna roll these\n\n326\n00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.790\nout to let customers that\nthey're supporting now.\n\n327\n00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:20.140\nWould that be maybe a coupling of\nboth of those client notification,\n\n328\n00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.770\nas well as scheduled downtime?\n\n329\n00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:27.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's several different ones\nthat are out there that what they're\n\n330\n00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.720\ntrying to do is find a balance\nbetween over communicating and\n\n331\n00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.920\nunder communicating, right?\n\n332\n00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.030\nBecause these systems,\nthe infrastructures are so big and\n\n333\n00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.550\nso complex that they're constantly\nrolling something new out.\n\n334\n00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:42.610\nWe were talking about Amazon in the\nmeeting this morning, about how Amazon,\n\n335\n00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.540\nit's like the roll out a new\nAWS product every single week.\n\n336\n00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:49.290\nSo if they were communicating that to you,\nyou'd get overwhelmed eventually.\n\n337\n00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.500\nIt's just too much data, right?\n\n338\n00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.036\nBut if they don't communicate enough with\nyou and then something's not working,\n\n339\n00:15:56.036 --> 00:15:57.803\nyou can get really frustrated.\n\n340\n00:15:57.803 --> 00:16:00.634\nSo what a lot of vendors have started\ndoing are what are called health\n\n341\n00:16:00.634 --> 00:16:01.237\ndashboards.\n\n342\n00:16:01.237 --> 00:16:06.816\nAnd I just brought up Office 365, so\nWith Office 365 they have a ton approach.\n\n343\n00:16:06.816 --> 00:16:07.790\nThis is Microsoft.\n\n344\n00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:10.720\nSo they have Exchange Online and\nIdentity Services.\n\n345\n00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.530\nThe Office 365 portal, Business\nIntelligence, all this different things.\n\n346\n00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:19.900\nAnd what they do is they put out\nthis little chart that is updated\n\n347\n00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.070\nevery single day, and\nyou're seeing the health.\n\n348\n00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:23.520\nAnd so I can see right here,\n\n349\n00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.970\nAzure Information Protection has been\nrunning just fine for the last week.\n\n350\n00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.410\nNo problems.\n\n351\n00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:32.601\nBut I can see right here that Power BI\nwhich is Business Intelligence,\n\n352\n00:16:32.601 --> 00:16:37.730\nI have no idea beyond that but it has some\nissues back on January 18 and January 17.\n\n353\n00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:42.246\nSo if I notice some weird behavior I\ncould come in here and click on that and\n\n354\n00:16:42.246 --> 00:16:47.134\nit'll give me the information, eventually\nit will give me the information,\n\n355\n00:16:47.134 --> 00:16:49.598\nthere we go, and I can read the report.\n\n356\n00:16:49.598 --> 00:16:52.029\nAnd so\nwhat I can see is right here January 18th.\n\n357\n00:16:52.029 --> 00:16:54.940\nThere was an incident file.\n\n358\n00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.440\nAnd then here I can see what happens.\n\n359\n00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.030\nAll right.\n\n360\n00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.860\nAnd it says, there is a user and\npackers issued with credentials.\n\n361\n00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.380\nUsers were unable to edit credentials for\ndata sources and reports.\n\n362\n00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.440\nOkay, so here's what the problem is.\n\n363\n00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.840\nAnd then the final status, we've\ncompleted the deployment of the fix, and\n\n364\n00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.270\nif confirmed with our monitoring service,\nthe issues been resolved.\n\n365\n00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:17.970\nSo here, they didn't notify us\nuntil they had already fixed it.\n\n366\n00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.450\nThis is the first report right here.\n\n367\n00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:25.050\nJanuary 18th at 3:14 pm,\nand service restored.\n\n368\n00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:28.010\nNow that's not always like that\nactually here let me make sure\n\n369\n00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.865\nI'm I'm not telling you the truth\nthat's there sort of that words.\n\n370\n00:17:30.865 --> 00:17:32.025\n[LAUGH] If I would look.\n\n371\n00:17:32.025 --> 00:17:34.414\nAlright so this is the last\none if I go back in times so\n\n372\n00:17:34.414 --> 00:17:36.205\nthat was January 18 to 3:00 pm.\n\n373\n00:17:36.205 --> 00:17:40.902\nLet's go back to the beginning\nJanuary 17 at 8:00 pm so\n\n374\n00:17:40.902 --> 00:17:43.400\nwas that 19 hours or earlier.\n\n375\n00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:47.450\n19 hours earlier is when the actual\nservice degradation started.\n\n376\n00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.120\nAnd then we can see right here,\n\n377\n00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.920\nissue with credentials users\nare unable to edit current status.\n\n378\n00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.860\nWe've determined that a recent\nnetwork configuration change\n\n379\n00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.510\ninadvertently caused this issue and\nwe're working on a fix.\n\n380\n00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.020\nSo they communicated it very quickly.\n\n381\n00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.010\nIt was detected and\nthey communicated out what was going on.\n\n382\n00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:07.130\nThis is the problem and\nhere's who's affected.\n\n383\n00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.830\nHere's our scope of impact.\n\n384\n00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:11.692\nAnd here's our preliminary root\ncause we're not positive but\n\n385\n00:18:11.692 --> 00:18:13.371\nthis is what we think the problem is.\n\n386\n00:18:13.371 --> 00:18:17.318\nAnd then when you start to scroll up\nhere you'll see where the current status\n\n387\n00:18:17.318 --> 00:18:19.971\nthey've determined\nthe configuration change and\n\n388\n00:18:19.971 --> 00:18:22.590\nnow they're going in to implement that.\n\n389\n00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.280\nAnd then we get up top we'll find\nwhere they finally actually fix it.\n\n390\n00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.470\nIt took them 19 hours to fix the problem.\n\n391\n00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:32.272\nAnd they communicated four\ntimes at 8:00 pm on the 17th,\n\n392\n00:18:32.272 --> 00:18:35.624\nat 9:00 pm on the 17th an hour later and\n\n393\n00:18:35.624 --> 00:18:39.350\nthen we jump all the way\nto 1:00 pm on 18th.\n\n394\n00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:45.357\nYou know it's a pretty big jump there\nit's 14 or 15 hours later, right?\n\n395\n00:18:45.357 --> 00:18:48.986\nAnd then the final resolution but\nthey stayed in communication with us.\n\n396\n00:18:48.986 --> 00:18:53.855\nNow via email cuz we get overwhelmed with\nthese things but with a dashboard and so\n\n397\n00:18:53.855 --> 00:18:58.799\nthat's a great way that companies can\ncommunicate out sometimes you have issues\n\n398\n00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:03.306\nthat can go really long look at this\nthe dialing conferencing looks like it\n\n399\n00:19:03.306 --> 00:19:07.910\nhas had an issue every day for an entire\nweek and it appears we're on going.\n\n400\n00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.130\nLet's see a little early and\nsee what's going on there.\n\n401\n00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:14.070\nSo, communicating like this is a great\nway to keep your users informed.\n\n402\n00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.450\nAnd they don't have to open\nup their own ticket and\n\n403\n00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:20.430\nget involved but you know the Microsoft\npeople are working to fix it.\n\n404\n00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:24.130\nAmazon has their own dashboard,\nmost never gonna have it.\n\n405\n00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.246\nUsually if you wanna find out\na company and figure out,\n\n406\n00:19:26.246 --> 00:19:27.908\nusually you just do their name and status.\n\n407\n00:19:27.908 --> 00:19:32.799\nSo we might say like AWS status and\nthey'll have a status page here.\n\n408\n00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:36.260\nThe AWS service health page.\n\n409\n00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.510\nAnd so we can come here a look at\neach of their data centers and\n\n410\n00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.620\ntheir services and so on.\n\n411\n00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:45.590\nSpeaking of redundancy, notice how there's\nthings in here like Amazon AppStream.\n\n412\n00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:50.270\nWell, Amazon AppStream they have it\nin North Virginia and in Oregon.\n\n413\n00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.970\nSo, if the North Virginia\ndata center fails,\n\n414\n00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:54.920\nthey've got the entire\nthing over in Oregon also.\n\n415\n00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.770\nThey've planned for that redundancy.\n\n416\n00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.810\nSo we might have an issue in one,\nbut its working fine in the other.\n\n417\n00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:02.430\nSo these types of health\nreports are really valuable.\n\n418\n00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:06.840\nAnd did we pick a day where Amazon\nhas no failures whatsoever?\n\n419\n00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.750\nMy goodness.\n\n420\n00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:12.356\nAmazon has a really good track record,\nbut normally its not perfect.\n\n421\n00:20:12.356 --> 00:20:16.141\nWow, they're 100% right now.\n\n422\n00:20:16.141 --> 00:20:18.060\nI don't think I've ever seen that.\n\n423\n00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.780\nWell, anyhow, hey Amazon,\nthey do a good job.\n\n424\n00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.320\nSo this is all here.\n\n425\n00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.090\nYou'll see where they've got RSS feeds and\nstuff that you can link to, too,\n\n426\n00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.670\nall sorts of different ways that\nyou can get that communication\n\n427\n00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:29.430\nto make sure that everything is\nrunning the way that we want.\n\n428\n00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.560\nAll right, so for us,\nwhat do we need to know about all this?\n\n429\n00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.700\nWell, we need to know when\ndowntime is about to happen.\n\n430\n00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.150\nAnd ideally we know it ahead of time,\nright.\n\n431\n00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:43.020\nUnscheduled, typically means we\ndidn't know it ahead of time.\n\n432\n00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.440\nSomething bad happened and\nnow we're in trouble.\n\n433\n00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:48.130\nHow do we know things ahead of time?\n\n434\n00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.020\nWell, for simple updates,\nyou can spot that.\n\n435\n00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.010\nYou can say, all right,\nMicrosoft just announced an update.\n\n436\n00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.270\nI need to roll it out, I need to reboot.\n\n437\n00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.760\nLet me schedule that, no big deal.\n\n438\n00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.270\nBut there are other things,\n\n439\n00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:03.580\nusually centering around performance, that\nwe can predict the downtime also, right?\n\n440\n00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.670\nWhen it comes to performance,\nyou need to be doing trending.\n\n441\n00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:11.380\nTrending is saying, all right,\nhere's my average CPU utilization today.\n\n442\n00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.790\nAnd the next month,\nwhat's my average CP utilization.\n\n443\n00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.450\nAnd the month after it,\nand the month after.\n\n444\n00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:20.330\nAnd you start creating these little metric\npoints that you can measure out and\n\n445\n00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:21.800\nsay, look at this.\n\n446\n00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.820\nMy CP utilization is going\nup by 10% every month.\n\n447\n00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:30.610\nAnd if I look, I might see that we're\nincreasing our customer base every month.\n\n448\n00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:34.290\nSo, as our customer base is growing,\nour CP utilization is growing.\n\n449\n00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:35.290\nMakes sense, right?\n\n450\n00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.060\nThat's a normal cost of doing business.\n\n451\n00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.960\nBut we're going by 10% every month,\nwhat's gonna happen in 10 months?\n\n452\n00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.310\nThis will be a maximum,\nassuming that I have to have a CPU for\n\n453\n00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.620\nthe operating system anyway.\n\n454\n00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.018\nBut if I'm going by 10% every month,\nin 10 months I'm at 100%.\n\n455\n00:21:48.018 --> 00:21:50.290\nMy CPU's are pegged out.\n\n456\n00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:51.110\nSo what's gonna happen in month 11?\n\n457\n00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.840\nCustomers are gonna start complaining.\n\n458\n00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.329\nOhh website is slow,\nthis application takes forever,\n\n459\n00:21:57.329 --> 00:21:59.417\nI tols you that's what happens.\n\n460\n00:21:59.417 --> 00:22:03.775\nBut at month five we should see that,\nwe should be able to see hello,\n\n461\n00:22:03.775 --> 00:22:06.528\nthe last five months have gone up 10% for\n\n462\n00:22:06.528 --> 00:22:11.990\neach month I mean 50% CPU that's\ngood we're going upgrade right now.\n\n463\n00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:14.300\nI've got five months to fix it, right?\n\n464\n00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.920\nIf you spot it early,\nyou can fix it early, right?\n\n465\n00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.300\nAnd you need to be watching the big four.\n\n466\n00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:25.550\nWe've talked about this in other episodes,\nbut CPU utilization, network bandwidth,\n\n467\n00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:30.450\nRAM utilization and disk I/O or IOPS,\ninput/output operations per second, but\n\n468\n00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:36.110\nalso disk utilization, whether your drives\nare full, right, cuz that all grows, too.\n\n469\n00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:39.470\nThose are the big four, and\nyou need to be monitoring them\n\n470\n00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:42.970\nusing some kind of system that\ndoes recording and trending.\n\n471\n00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.290\nAnd in another episode I showed you\nguys the solar winds network performance\n\n472\n00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:47.990\nmonitor that does that,\nit's a really good one.\n\n473\n00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:51.920\nIn this episode I'll just use,\nlet me use the built in Windows one.\n\n474\n00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:58.160\nIn Windows Server you have a utility\ncalled the resource Monitor.\n\n475\n00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.220\nWe used to always use\nthe performance monitor.\n\n476\n00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.970\nPerformance monitor is great but\nit's really just showing you stuff\n\n477\n00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:07.430\nright now and it's only showing you\nthe overall numbers of the big four.\n\n478\n00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.170\nSometimes we want more\ndetailed information and\n\n479\n00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.280\nthe resource monitor does\na better job of that.\n\n480\n00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.780\nSo when I say my CPU is going up\nby 10% each month, that's great.\n\n481\n00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.070\nWhat is it?\n\n482\n00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:20.150\nWhat's generating that CPU\nutilization Which program is it?\n\n483\n00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.720\nOr look I'm getting a lot of disk I/O.\n\n484\n00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.640\nWhat's happening?\n\n485\n00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.510\nWhat program is writing to the disk?\n\n486\n00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:27.740\nWhat program is reading from the disk?\n\n487\n00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.780\nWhich files are being access?\n\n488\n00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.720\nPerformance monitor doesn't tell you that.\n\n489\n00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.330\nIt just tells you the overall member.\n\n490\n00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:36.460\nBut the resource monitor,\nthis guy If you look at it.\n\n491\n00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:40.320\nI've got CPU, disk, network,\nmemory, the big four.\n\n492\n00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.343\nThen when I go into CPU,\n\n493\n00:23:41.343 --> 00:23:44.067\nI can see the programs that\nare running right now on the system.\n\n494\n00:23:44.067 --> 00:23:48.620\nAnd if I sorted out I'll see that\nthe forth month, forms consuming the most.\n\n495\n00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.850\nI guess that makes sense.\n\n496\n00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.680\nAnd so I can it doing it's thing.\n\n497\n00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:58.597\nAnd I can pull up additional details on it\nto find out more about what it's doing.\n\n498\n00:23:58.597 --> 00:24:02.269\nNow in CPU it doesn't give me\na whole heck of a lot more here but\n\n499\n00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:05.224\nif I switch over to the CPU tab And\nI take perf mod.\n\n500\n00:24:05.224 --> 00:24:06.410\nI can come down here and\n\n501\n00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.930\nI can expand out services that\nare involved in that process.\n\n502\n00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:14.470\nI can pull up associated handles, these\nare other files that are being accessed.\n\n503\n00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:18.530\nAnd then I can pull up\nthe associated modules, and\n\n504\n00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.750\nI can see all the dynamic link\nlibraries that are being referenced.\n\n505\n00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.420\nNow, why do I care about this?\n\n506\n00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:28.730\nI might have more than one\nprogram using the same dll, and\n\n507\n00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:29.700\nI'll be able to find that here.\n\n508\n00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.210\nI can see what all is tied\ninto this application,\n\n509\n00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.270\nwhat all it's referencing and using.\n\n510\n00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:39.110\nAnd it's really super handy when\nwe're talking about disk IO.\n\n511\n00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:43.490\nWhen I go to disc and I start taking\na look at this and seeing who it is that's\n\n512\n00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:47.190\nusing the most, and I filtered my screens,\nlet me turn off my filter.\n\n513\n00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.201\nThere we go.\n\n514\n00:24:48.201 --> 00:24:50.530\nActually I guess I'm just\nrunning my perf mods, that's it.\n\n515\n00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.290\nBut I can come in and\nI can take one of these applications and\n\n516\n00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.630\nI can see exactly what they're accessing.\n\n517\n00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.450\nWell, these guys aren't accessing much, so\n\n518\n00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:04.280\nlet me generate maybe something that\ncan like a good old Internet Explorer.\n\n519\n00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.657\nInternet Explorer is going to create\ntemporary internet files, all right.\n\n520\n00:25:07.657 --> 00:25:09.204\nAnd so when it does that,\n\n521\n00:25:09.204 --> 00:25:13.440\nin the background I can see\nInternet Explorer ramping up.\n\n522\n00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.450\nAnd I can start to look at the disk\nactivity that it's generating.\n\n523\n00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:20.810\nAnd I can look at the exact\nfiles that it's accessing.\n\n524\n00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:25.180\nAnd some of it, like this one,\nis going to be Internet cache, right?\n\n525\n00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.718\nThings like temporary Internet\nfiles that are being accessed.\n\n526\n00:25:26.718 --> 00:25:32.460\nHere's my content caching right here for\nwhatever it's doing.\n\n527\n00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:35.370\nAnd I can find the disk IO for it.\n\n528\n00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:39.750\nAnd if I record this information,\nI can record it over time and\n\n529\n00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:41.740\nuse it as a reference.\n\n530\n00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:46.066\nAnd I could say on an average day,\nmy disk IO is averaging a certain amount.\n\n531\n00:25:46.066 --> 00:25:48.227\nAnd you can kinda see that\namount over here, and\n\n532\n00:25:48.227 --> 00:25:51.030\nmy disk queue link is\naveraging a certain amount.\n\n533\n00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:55.700\nAnd if I see it steadily creeping up,\nI need to find out, is that bad?\n\n534\n00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.640\nIs that a problem?\n\n535\n00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.750\nIs something wrong?\n\n536\n00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:02.230\nOr is my company just doing great and\ngrowing every day, what we hoped for.\n\n537\n00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.960\nAnd if it is I'm even planning for\nan upgrade.\n\n538\n00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.020\nIf it's something wrong,\nI need to find out what it is and fix it.\n\n539\n00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.110\nBut if it's just growth,\n\n540\n00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:13.530\nI can use this to figure out to\nthe day when I need to do an upgrade.\n\n541\n00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:17.030\nI can say, look I'm going to upgrade\nthe serve three months from now or\n\n542\n00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.100\nwe're going to be in trouble.\n\n543\n00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.080\nAnd so\nyou can start to get the budget work done.\n\n544\n00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.970\nIn an enterprise environment you've got to\nget this things approved through a budget.\n\n545\n00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:26.820\nIf I have to deploy a new stand it could\nbe a hundreds and thousands of dollars.\n\n546\n00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.580\nI don't want to just spring that\non the CIO one day in a standup\n\n547\n00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:30.280\nmeeting in the morning.\n\n548\n00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.890\nHey, by the way we need to spend\n200 grand on a new stand, surprise.\n\n549\n00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:39.620\nRight, or I could say according\nto our current trends\n\n550\n00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:43.730\nin 18 months our stand\nis going to be outsized.\n\n551\n00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.100\nAnd when that happens,\nwe're gonna need to upgrade.\n\n552\n00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.220\nWe need to start working that\ninto our budget for next year.\n\n553\n00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.229\nAnd now we go into the budget and that\nprocess can happen and nobody's shocked\n\n554\n00:26:52.229 --> 00:26:55.151\nand surprised and everybody's operating\nunder a constant expectation.\n\n555\n00:26:55.151 --> 00:26:58.300\nNow, this software here is probably\nthe least user friendly and\n\n556\n00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.051\nit's actually pretty friendly but\n\n557\n00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:04.100\nthere's third party software out there\nthat does an amazing job with this stuff.\n\n558\n00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.860\nSome of it is very expensive like the\nSolarWinds Network Performance Monitor.\n\n559\n00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:13.400\nSome of it is free like Nagios, it's\njust a pain in the butt to get set up.\n\n560\n00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.640\nBut pick a product,\npick what it is you wanna use.\n\n561\n00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.100\nA CA Unicenter is another one.\n\n562\n00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.780\nIt's a night mare to get setup,\nit does a great job once it works.\n\n563\n00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.063\nAnd once you get those in place they can\nrecord this data and they control that\n\n564\n00:27:24.063 --> 00:27:29.480\ntrending, it's super handy really going\nto be a valuable thing to avoid downtime.\n\n565\n00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.960\nCuz you don't wanna come\nin one morning and,\n\n566\n00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.040\nhey nobody can login to the web server.\n\n567\n00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.030\nAnd you go and you look and\nthe web server's hard drive is full.\n\n568\n00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:40.510\nWell, the hard drive didn't just fill up\nover night, well maybe I mean if there was\n\n569\n00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.560\nsomething wrong with it,\nsomebody hacks into it or whatever.\n\n570\n00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.308\nBut normally it slowly grew over time,\ngetting more and more full.\n\n571\n00:27:46.308 --> 00:27:49.488\nAnd you should have seen that coming and\nfixed it ahead of time,\n\n572\n00:27:49.488 --> 00:27:51.990\nexpanding that drive or whatever.\n\n573\n00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:56.010\nBut now you didn't see it coming, and now\nyou've got outages, you've got down time,\n\n574\n00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.710\nyou've got unscheduled maintenance that\nhas to occur in the middle of the day to\n\n575\n00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.120\nfree up space in that drive.\n\n576\n00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.550\nRight, that's not what you want.\n\n577\n00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:04.100\nSo trending software is\ngonna be very critical.\n\n578\n00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.240\n&gt;&gt; You know, Don, when it comes to\nthe performance of a machine I know we've\n\n579\n00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.120\ngot a couple of brand new MacBooks here.\n\n580\n00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.470\nWell, fairly new,\nI know yours is actually kinda old.\n\n581\n00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:17.300\nBut if you were to ask me right now is\nthis MacBook fast, I would say, well,\n\n582\n00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.630\nI don't know if it's fast or not.\n\n583\n00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.961\nAnd in fact I don't really know if it's\nmuch faster than when I bought it.\n\n584\n00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:25.280\nWell, if you were gonna ask me\nas a junior admin to come and\n\n585\n00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.280\ngive you some information on your server,\nI know that answer wouldn't fly,\n\n586\n00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.380\nit wouldn't go over too well.\n\n587\n00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:33.730\nSo is there any way that I could find out\nis the performance that I have in this\n\n588\n00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:38.680\nmachine now the same type of performance\nwe got the first time we deployed it.\n\n589\n00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:42.522\n&gt;&gt; Well, once we both have MacBooks and\nit's easy to answer, no it's not fast.\n\n590\n00:28:42.522 --> 00:28:45.760\n[LAUGH] But we want to be factual\nabout these things, right.\n\n591\n00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.710\nSo what happens is,\nyou get a new laptop, get a new desktop,\n\n592\n00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:52.670\nyou get a new server and you're amazed.\n\n593\n00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:56.030\nThis thing is so fast,\nit's amazing and then a year later,\n\n594\n00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:59.750\nit wasn't so fast anymore,\nusers start complaining that it's slow.\n\n595\n00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:01.600\nWell, is it actually slow?\n\n596\n00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.280\nI know we've talked about\nthis in another episode but\n\n597\n00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.660\nwe need a way to find that out and\na performance is based on how we do it.\n\n598\n00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:09.060\nBack in the installing a server episode,\n\n599\n00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.220\nI showed you guys how to\ncreate a performance baseline.\n\n600\n00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.557\nWe fire up the same performance\ntools that I'm using right now.\n\n601\n00:29:14.557 --> 00:29:17.070\nPerformance tools or\nwhatever softwares that is you wanna use.\n\n602\n00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.690\nAnd you capture how the server's\nperforming at that time.\n\n603\n00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:21.940\nIs it doing a great job?\n\n604\n00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.530\nProbably, it's brand new.\n\n605\n00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:25.380\nAnd then you record all your data.\n\n606\n00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.310\nAnd then a year later, when somebody\nsays things aren't going fast, or\n\n607\n00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.890\nyou think things aren't going fast,\nwe just compare the numbers.\n\n608\n00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.759\nWe can constantly compare and\nlook and see.\n\n609\n00:29:32.759 --> 00:29:35.989\nAnd if they still match up,\nthen everything's fine.\n\n610\n00:29:35.989 --> 00:29:37.410\nYou don't need to do anything.\n\n611\n00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:38.900\nDon't do maintenance.\n\n612\n00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.660\nDon't fix something that isn't broken,\nright.\n\n613\n00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.120\nThat's the saying and\nit definitely holds true here.\n\n614\n00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.040\nBut if it's not the same,\nnow we need to find out why.\n\n615\n00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.360\nYou need to do what's called\nroot cause analysis, right.\n\n616\n00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.493\nThe server's slow.\nThat's a symptom not a cause which causing\n\n617\n00:29:53.493 --> 00:29:56.840\nit to be slow,\nyou've got to find that cause.\n\n618\n00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.130\nYou don't treat the symptom,\nyou treat the cause.\n\n619\n00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:04.200\nMaybe the server is slow because it's\ngot some process on it that's spiralling\n\n620\n00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.990\nout of control and eating up all the CPU.\n\n621\n00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:10.100\nWell, if I buy a new server with 24 CPUs\nin it that are the top of the line and\n\n622\n00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.886\nI'm move this off or over to it,\nit'll still spire out of control and\n\n623\n00:30:13.886 --> 00:30:16.010\nthere still eat a 100% of the CPU.\n\n624\n00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:19.370\nI treated the symptom not the cause.\n\n625\n00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:22.020\nI need to find out why that software\nis spinning out of control.\n\n626\n00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.356\nAnd it's probably just a bug that I\ncan get with the software vendor and\n\n627\n00:30:24.356 --> 00:30:25.000\nthey could fix it.\n\n628\n00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.890\nAnd all this time is back in the normal\nregions where you expect it to be.\n\n629\n00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:31.530\nAnd I didn't have to spend\nany money on a server, right?\n\n630\n00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:35.140\nIt's always important to make sure we\nunderstand what that root cause is.\n\n631\n00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.736\nAll right, having a performance\nbaseline is how we can compare that,\n\n632\n00:30:37.736 --> 00:30:39.102\nit's really gonna make that handy.\n\n633\n00:30:39.102 --> 00:30:41.565\nThere's tons of different\nsoftware that they could do,\n\n634\n00:30:41.565 --> 00:30:43.270\nI've showed you guys a couple of them.\n\n635\n00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:45.750\nWindows Performance Monitor\nis built into Windows.\n\n636\n00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:49.110\nIn the Unix world you have\nthe activity monitor on some systems.\n\n637\n00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:52.600\nYou've always got utilities like top and\ndf and you can\n\n638\n00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.430\nwrite scripts that just automatically\nrun and gather the data and store it.\n\n639\n00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:59.242\nBut honestly in the Unix\nworld I like Zabbix, but\n\n640\n00:30:59.242 --> 00:31:02.398\nZabbix is built on Nagios so\nyou can use Nagios, MRTG,\n\n641\n00:31:02.398 --> 00:31:06.602\nthere's a ton of open source products\nout there that can monitor those.\n\n642\n00:31:06.602 --> 00:31:10.558\nAnd there's commercial products, too, like\nSolarWind, CA Unicenter, and those guys,\n\n643\n00:31:10.558 --> 00:31:14.790\nbut have something that's collecting\nthat data so you can trend against it.\n\n644\n00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:17.000\nAll right,\nthe last thing I wanna mention is not so\n\n645\n00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.940\nmuch about performance, but\njust about preventing downtime.\n\n646\n00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.710\nAnd usually, downtime is not a surprise.\n\n647\n00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:26.670\nIt might be a surprise to you, but it's\nusually not a surprise to the computer.\n\n648\n00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.400\nThe computer normally\nknows it's coming and\n\n649\n00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.390\nyou'll normally spot it in\nthe logs on that system.\n\n650\n00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.920\nOn Unix systems we have the sys log, or\n\n651\n00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:39.760\non newer systems you have the journald\nsystem inside the systemd.\n\n652\n00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.270\nBut either way you have\nthese message logs.\n\n653\n00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.870\nIn the Windows world you have\nthe Event Viewer and the Event Logs.\n\n654\n00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:48.690\nIn the Mac world you have some systems,\ntoo.\n\n655\n00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:53.700\nSo those messages are everything that's\ngoing on in the background of your server.\n\n656\n00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.732\nAnd you might be getting\nsome performance errors or\n\n657\n00:31:55.732 --> 00:31:57.867\nother things that are popping\nup in those event logs.\n\n658\n00:31:57.867 --> 00:31:59.352\nAnd they start out as warnings,\n\n659\n00:31:59.352 --> 00:32:02.047\nlike hey here's a problem you\nprobably need to address and\n\n660\n00:32:02.047 --> 00:32:05.605\nthen they turned into straight up errors\n&gt;&gt; And that means things are going wrong.\n\n661\n00:32:05.605 --> 00:32:09.347\nIf you keep track of your event logs, if\nyou monitor those and just sift through it\n\n662\n00:32:09.347 --> 00:32:13.660\nfor information like that, a lot of times\nyou can spot problems before they occur.\n\n663\n00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.543\nOr more importantly, you can spot\nproblems before your end users do.\n\n664\n00:32:16.543 --> 00:32:18.400\nProblems are gonna happen.\n\n665\n00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.780\nIf you can fix it before\nan end user notices,\n\n666\n00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.775\nthat's like that secret win right there,\nright?\n\n667\n00:32:22.775 --> 00:32:25.230\nIt's like the problem never existed,\nyou fixed it.\n\n668\n00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:27.790\nBut you need time to sift those logs and\nthat can be very hard.\n\n669\n00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:32.750\nSo having some kind of central aggregating\nserver where all the logs get collapsed,\n\n670\n00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.850\nand a way to be able to search\nthrough those is important.\n\n671\n00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:37.220\nThere's a lot of third party syslog\nservers that are out there and other\n\n672\n00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.450\nservices that let you do that to aggregate\nthat information together and filter it.\n\n673\n00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:44.355\nBut it only does good if\nyou actually look at it.\n\n674\n00:32:44.355 --> 00:32:47.800\nSo it needs to be part of your routine\nprocedures that you set aside a few hours\n\n675\n00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.810\nevery week for reviewing event logs, and\n\n676\n00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:55.020\nrunning performance reports on your\nservers and collecting that data.\n\n677\n00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.280\nIf you can automate it\nwith third party software,\n\n678\n00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.900\nthat software's gonna be expensive,\nbut it's gonna be worth it.\n\n679\n00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.200\nIn a small or medium business,\nyou'll probably have to do by hand.\n\n680\n00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.435\nBut you've got less systems to monitor,\nso it won't be so bad.\n\n681\n00:33:04.435 --> 00:33:06.660\nBut that's really the approach\nyou need to take.\n\n682\n00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.860\nIt's something you've\ngot to stay on top of.\n\n683\n00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.236\nWell, Don, there's a lot of\ngood information there, I know,\n\n684\n00:33:11.236 --> 00:33:13.172\nlooking at our objectives\nlist that we've still got\n\n685\n00:33:13.172 --> 00:33:13.740\nmore to go-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n686\n00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.090\n&gt;&gt; But once again we have run out of\n\n687\n00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:16.920\ntime on the clock.\n\n688\n00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.569\nSo before we wrap this one up, Don,\non our server maintenance part two here,\n\n689\n00:33:20.569 --> 00:33:24.332\ndo you got any additional words you might\nlike to let people know about outages,\n\n690\n00:33:24.332 --> 00:33:27.112\nservice level plans, and\neven performance monitoring?\n\n691\n00:33:27.112 --> 00:33:30.267\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, in part one and\npart two of this, we've really been\n\n692\n00:33:30.267 --> 00:33:33.930\ntalking about bureaucracy and work,\npaperwork, monitoring, maintenance.\n\n693\n00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:34.620\nIt doesn't sound fun.\n\n694\n00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:38.280\nIt doesn't sound glorious, but it is\nthe difference between a good admin and\n\n695\n00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.610\na bad admin, right?\n\n696\n00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:43.760\nA good admin has a monitor on their\ndesktop that's showing them some kind\n\n697\n00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.260\nof overall status report that\nthey're able to watch and see.\n\n698\n00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:50.010\nAnd a good admin is spotting\nerrors before the end user does.\n\n699\n00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:54.090\nA bad admin is one that has Facebook\nup on the monitor, on their desk, and\n\n700\n00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:57.630\nthey're waiting for a user to call in and\ntell them a problem exists, right.\n\n701\n00:33:57.630 --> 00:33:59.500\nYou've always got work to do.\n\n702\n00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.689\nA system admin is never bored, right?\n\n703\n00:34:01.689 --> 00:34:03.960\nA system admin doesn't have\ntime to browse Facebook.\n\n704\n00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:07.255\nThere's always something\nto do from monitoring and\n\n705\n00:34:07.255 --> 00:34:10.120\nrerunning backups to testing\nwhether you can restore.\n\n706\n00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:14.420\nOr from monitoring performance,\nresearching new replacements for hardware.\n\n707\n00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:18.610\nThere's so\nmuch work to be done that you stay busy.\n\n708\n00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:22.700\nAnd that's how I recognize a good admin\nfrom a bad admin is the ones who tell me\n\n709\n00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:27.070\nthey've got a system so\nstable that they can just relax at work,\n\n710\n00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:29.140\nthey're not doing the work\nthat they need to do.\n\n711\n00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:30.630\nAnd one day it won't be stable.\n\n712\n00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:33.320\nAnd that's when you end up with an RGE,\nright?\n\n713\n00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.120\nA resonate generating event.\n\n714\n00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:38.147\nEventually some kind of failure\nhappens and it's your fault for\n\n715\n00:34:38.147 --> 00:34:39.331\nnot putting the work in.\n\n716\n00:34:39.331 --> 00:34:40.950\nYou don't want that to happen, right?\n\n717\n00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:44.040\nWe used to make the joke though\nthat no failure is truly terrible\n\n718\n00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.410\nas long as there's at least one printer\nthat still works in the building.\n\n719\n00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:48.480\nAs long as you can print\nyour resume it's not so bad.\n\n720\n00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.440\nBut if that last printer fails,\nthen I get really screwed, right?\n\n721\n00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.010\nSo you don't want to get to that point and\n\n722\n00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:55.030\nmaintenance is the way that we\nprevent that from happening.\n\n723\n00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:57.710\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, well, we appreciate\nhaving you here in the studios.\n\n724\n00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:59.710\nAgain, I'm gonna go ahead and\nclose down Facebook,\n\n725\n00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:02.670\nmake sure that at least\none printer does work.\n\n726\n00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:05.490\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n727\n00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:06.280\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n728\n00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.047\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time\n\n729\n00:35:08.047 -->

00:00:08.198\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.198 --> 00:00:11.822\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.822 --> 00:00:14.515\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITPROTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:17.275\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:17.275 --> 00:00:22.315\nwe are continuing through our\nCompTIA Server Plus SK0-004 certification.\n\n8\n00:00:22.315 --> 00:00:25.655\nBack with a part three I\nbelieve in server maintenance.\n\n9\n00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:28.320\nAnd joining us back in the studio\nis none other that Mr. Don Pizzett.\n\n10\n00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.050\nDon, how are you doing sir?\n\n11\n00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.220\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.450\nReady to dive right back into a little\nbit of server maintenance and\n\n13\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.750\nyou know the last couple episodes\nwe've been talking about concepts and\n\n14\n00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.710\ntheory, and we've been talking about\npolicies, and procedure, and software,\n\n15\n00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.540\nperformance monitoring that kind of stuff.\n\n16\n00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.140\nAnd this episode we're gonna go\na little bit more on the hardware side\n\n17\n00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.140\nof things because in this day and age, the\nmajority of the problems that we have that\n\n18\n00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.310\ntake a server offline do\nactually end up being hardware.\n\n19\n00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.140\nAnd that's because, well on the software\nside we usually have built in redundancy\n\n20\n00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.210\nif you have one web server you have two\nweb servers or three, or four, and so\n\n21\n00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.350\nif there's a software issue that one just\ngoes offline, the other ones take over.\n\n22\n00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.330\nYou format and\nreimage the machine and off you go.\n\n23\n00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.200\nThere's not a whole heck of a lot of\nsoftware trouble shooting we do these\n\n24\n00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.350\ndays, but on the hardware side,\nthat's physical hardware.\n\n25\n00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.960\nIt's already paid for and\nif it breaks, and goes offline,\n\n26\n00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.900\nyou can't just format your hardware,\nand reinstall.\n\n27\n00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.800\nYou need to get it working.\n\n28\n00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.240\nYou need to identify\nthe piece that's failed.\n\n29\n00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.855\nSo that's what we're gonna talk\nabout right here in this episode.\n\n30\n00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:25.970\nNow before I go breaking open a server and\npointing at things,\n\n31\n00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.660\nand potentially breaking it myself.\n\n32\n00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.260\nI wanna a talk a little bit about\nsome of the visual audio type\n\n33\n00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.690\ncues that a sever will give you to\nlet you know that it's not happy.\n\n34\n00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.239\nThat servers do have a way of doing that,\n\n35\n00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:40.490\nof telling you that's something is\nnot right and giving you a warning.\n\n36\n00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.130\nSometimes they can give you that warning\nahead of time, sometimes they can't and\n\n37\n00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.210\nit's only once the problem is there\nthat you are given whatever this\n\n38\n00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.430\nmessage is from the server.\n\n39\n00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.960\nIt speaks from beyond.\n\n40\n00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.095\nWell there's no more clear issue with\na server, that when you walk up to it,\n\n41\n00:01:56.095 --> 00:02:00.435\nlook at it's face plate, and\nall of it's lights are off, right?\n\n42\n00:02:00.435 --> 00:02:01.635\nIt's powered off.\n\n43\n00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:04.705\nAnd you push the power button,\nand nothing happens.\n\n44\n00:02:04.705 --> 00:02:05.875\nThe server is dead, right?\n\n45\n00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:07.365\nCompletely dead.\n\n46\n00:02:07.365 --> 00:02:10.435\nNow that is actually pretty uncommon.\n\n47\n00:02:10.435 --> 00:02:14.480\nPretty uncommon for a server to just\nbe completely dead in the water.\n\n48\n00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.420\nAnd the reason is there is a lot of\ncircuitry on the motherboard of a server\n\n49\n00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.460\nthat is designed to operate independently\nthat all of the hard drives can be failed,\n\n50\n00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.220\nbut the server's hardware maintenance\nsystems are still functional and it's ESM\n\n51\n00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.120\nor embedded service manager, or whatever\nit's got will still be functional.\n\n52\n00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.430\nThat if it's got a remote insight board or\n\n53\n00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.160\na insight remote,\nlet me get my naming right here.\n\n54\n00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.330\nThe remote insight lights out,\nthe ILOE board.\n\n55\n00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.670\nIf it's got a Dell Remote Access\nController or a DRAC in there.\n\n56\n00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.490\nThen those systems are gonna be up and\nrunning, and you can connect.\n\n57\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.550\nSo there's still be some kind of light or\nsome kind of life signs in that server.\n\n58\n00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.680\nFor it to be completely dead in the water,\nit either has to be a massive failure,\n\n59\n00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.310\nwhich is usually visible because of the\nmassive amount of damage it had to happen,\n\n60\n00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.490\nI'm assuming it takes an axe to the thing\nyou're gonna notice that, right?\n\n61\n00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.500\nOr power.\n\n62\n00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.750\nIf the server's getting no power, then\nit can't give you a message from beyond,\n\n63\n00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.540\nit can't give you beeps and tones, and\n\n64\n00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.860\ncodes, and lights, it can't give you\nthat stuff cuz it has no power, right.\n\n65\n00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.360\nSo it's extremely uncommon for\nthat to happen but it does happen,\n\n66\n00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.910\nyou do lose power.\n\n67\n00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.390\nUsually you notice because\nall the lights are off.\n\n68\n00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.790\nSo we don't need the server to tell us\nwhen we bump into things when we're\n\n69\n00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.340\nwalking around and hit the light switch,\nand nothing happens.\n\n70\n00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.030\nBut if you have a UPS.\n\n71\n00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.340\nIf you have generators, if you have those\nsystems in place in theory you should\n\n72\n00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.400\nnever be out of power either, all right?\n\n73\n00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.250\nSo if your sever's completely off,\nwhat happened there?\n\n74\n00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.250\nWell check your power cables.\n\n75\n00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.970\nRight, the power cables on the back of the\nserver are really not any different than\n\n76\n00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.970\nthe power cables that we use on\nthe desktop or any other machine.\n\n77\n00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.290\nThey can come loose.\n\n78\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.430\nThey can move free.\n\n79\n00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.970\nThey can be chewed\nthrough by rodents if you\n\n80\n00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.870\nhave that kind of problem in your\nserver and hopefully you don't.\n\n81\n00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.500\nBut they can also take dust in, and\nas they take dust in the components inside\n\n82\n00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.450\nthe power supply can overheat,\nand burn out.\n\n83\n00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.150\nThere's capacitors inside of\nthe power supplies that can pop.\n\n84\n00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.590\nNow I say power supplies plural\ncuz we normally have two.\n\n85\n00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.220\nSo again, for the server to be\ncompletely dead in the water,\n\n86\n00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.430\nI would have both power supplies fail.\n\n87\n00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.210\nWhich is even more unlikely.\n\n88\n00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.500\nSo it's an unlikely scenario,\nbut it can happen.\n\n89\n00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.660\nCheck your power.\n\n90\n00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.720\nCheck to make sure your cables\nare rated properly for the server.\n\n91\n00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.870\nIf it's never worked, you might be\nplugging into the wrong type of outlet.\n\n92\n00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.650\nIt might be expecting 220 and\nit's only getting 110.\n\n93\n00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.180\nRight, you can have the wrong voltage for\nsupply.\n\n94\n00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.010\nThere can be other things like that and\ninterfere with it.\n\n95\n00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.660\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, this one might have some more\nobvious sign as well because additional\n\n96\n00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.030\ndevice is just might be in that circuit.\n\n97\n00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.050\nBut it could have been environment.\n\n98\n00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.090\nI think lightning strikes could that\ncost two power adapters to go down.\n\n99\n00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.430\nThe [INAUDIBLE] power supply's\nto go down at the same time?\n\n100\n00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.030\n&gt;&gt; It could, yeah.\n\n101\n00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.250\nI mean,\nideally you have two power supply's,\n\n102\n00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.930\nrun to two different PDU's run\nto two different UPS's, right?\n\n103\n00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.600\nYou separation across that lane.\n\n104\n00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.250\nBut if you don't have that, right?\n\n105\n00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.580\nIf you have two power supply's and\nuse one of those y cables, and\n\n106\n00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.610\nit runs to one power plug in the wall.\n\n107\n00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.060\nWell you never done a power\nsupply if one fails.\n\n108\n00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.650\nBut if you take a surge,\nthat surge can go into both of them.\n\n109\n00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.660\nAnd it's just like any other\nparts while they can part, and\n\n110\n00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.980\nthen that's what we're\ngoing to have to replace.\n\n111\n00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.100\nNow here is where it gets a little tricky.\n\n112\n00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.810\nThe power supply failure can\nactually be in two different places.\n\n113\n00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.900\nIt could be the power supply itself and\nif that's the case,\n\n114\n00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.880\nwell that's not a big deal,\nmost power supplies pop right out\n\n115\n00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.100\njust like I've got this\none here on my hand now.\n\n116\n00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.430\nAnd I can get a replacement,\nand pop it in.\n\n117\n00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.140\nI might even have a few replacements\nlaying around just for that instance,\n\n118\n00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.760\nor I might put in a warranty call and\nget them to send me one.\n\n119\n00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.340\nSo not a big deal if a failure is here.\n\n120\n00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.530\nBut the other place the failure could\nbe is that on your power supply it's\n\n121\n00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.740\ngot a connector, and\n\n122\n00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.500\nthat connector usually plugs into some\nkind of riser inside of the server.\n\n123\n00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.400\nIt usually doesn't go straight\nto the motherboard and\n\n124\n00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.690\nI'll show you once we open\nthe server up how this one runs.\n\n125\n00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.510\nBut it's possible that the failure\nhas leapt from here to the riser,\n\n126\n00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.580\nor even the motherboard.\n\n127\n00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.350\nAnd the damage can be far more\nextensive inside that server than you\n\n128\n00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.520\ninitially think.\n\n129\n00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.630\nThe power supplies will\ndefinitely get damaged.\n\n130\n00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.820\nBut there could be more damage beyond it.\n\n131\n00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.140\nSo you can do a warranty call.\n\n132\n00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.240\nGet new power supplies, pop them in,\nand the server still doesn't turn on.\n\n133\n00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.090\nI actually had one scenario,\nand this was really worse case.\n\n134\n00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.060\nWhere the power supplies got burned\nout and the motherboard got damaged.\n\n135\n00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:34.060\nAnd it got damaged in a way that if\nI ever plugged in two power supplies,\n\n136\n00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.590\nthey would short each other out, and\nburn out the new power supplies.\n\n137\n00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.180\nSo we would get new power\nsupplies in pop them in and\n\n138\n00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.000\ninstantly burn them out, and think that\nthe problem was still somewhere else.\n\n139\n00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.970\nNot realizing that we had\njust burned these out.\n\n140\n00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.400\nSo it can be a bad situation\nwhen you have that happen.\n\n141\n00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.990\nA server that has absolutely no power,\nyou start with the power supplies.\n\n142\n00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.280\nThat's usually where that\nissue's gonna be, but\n\n143\n00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.670\nunderstand that it could be beyond that.\n\n144\n00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.340\nThere could be more elements in that mix.\n\n145\n00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.720\nAlright now, as long as we can get\neven a little bit of power though.\n\n146\n00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.230\nThe server will try and\ntell us what's wrong, and\n\n147\n00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.630\nthere's a few standard methods for\nthat to happen, right?\n\n148\n00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.300\nMost servers these days have a little\nLED screen on the front of them, or\n\n149\n00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.240\nan LCD screen of some sort.\n\n150\n00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.710\nAnd it could display messages.\n\n151\n00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.160\nDell, HPE, Lenovo, they all do it.\n\n152\n00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.620\nAnd the little message will often tell\nyou, hey, power supply one is bad.\n\n153\n00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.350\nOr you know memory in bank two.\n\n154\n00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.950\nDim in bank two is not registered or\nsmart failure on drive three.\n\n155\n00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.520\nIt'll tell you things like that.\n\n156\n00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.530\nAnd hopefully it tells you\nlike what I just said,\n\n157\n00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.240\nhey, power supply number one is dead.\n\n158\n00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.419\nI understand what that means.\n\n159\n00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:41.938\nWes, you understand what that means?\n\n160\n00:07:41.938 --> 00:07:42.842\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n161\n00:07:42.842 --> 00:07:47.190\n&gt;&gt; I bet, but what if I said,\nhey, Wes I've got error E2350?\n\n162\n00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.670\n&gt;&gt; Time to go to Google.\n\n163\n00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:49.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n164\n00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.371\nSometimes we don't get\nthese clear messages.\n\n165\n00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:54.554\nSo when the documentation\nepisode I mentioned something.\n\n166\n00:07:54.554 --> 00:07:55.813\nI mentioned service manuals.\n\n167\n00:07:55.813 --> 00:07:57.803\nAnd I said, that when you deploy\nservice in your environment.\n\n168\n00:07:57.803 --> 00:07:59.952\nYou need to store the service\nmanual somewhere.\n\n169\n00:07:59.952 --> 00:08:03.426\nBecause when you're server boots up and\nsome kind of error, it might give you\n\n170\n00:08:03.426 --> 00:08:07.190\na completely confusing code,\nyou don't know what to do with it, right?\n\n171\n00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.939\nNumerical codes are like that then\nyou'll see on the LCD screens.\n\n172\n00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:11.645\nThere are some that have a little lights.\n\n173\n00:08:11.645 --> 00:08:14.188\nDell's used to this for [INAUDIBLE],\nthey would have four lights.\n\n174\n00:08:14.188 --> 00:08:16.460\nAnd they were just numbered,\none, two, three, and four.\n\n175\n00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.530\nAnd if only light one was on and\nthat one thing.\n\n176\n00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.270\nBut if lights one and three were on and\nthen something different.\n\n177\n00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:28.320\nAnd if like two is on and like four was\nblinking, it ment to be on another thing.\n\n178\n00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.356\nWhy?\nI don't know what the heck those are.\n\n179\n00:08:29.356 --> 00:08:32.293\nBut it meant different things and we were\nexpected to be a little interpret with\n\n180\n00:08:32.293 --> 00:08:34.564\nthat\n&gt;&gt; I seen those on the OptiPlex series,\n\n181\n00:08:34.564 --> 00:08:38.809\nbut that's their work station so\nthey also get this in the servers as well\n\n182\n00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:39.785\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yep not for\n\n183\n00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:43.470\nlong, cuz it's terrible system but\nthey did do it.\n\n184\n00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.470\nThe reason they like it, or the reason\nthey thought it was a good idea,\n\n185\n00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.180\nis that lights are really easy to\ndisplay in the front of a system.\n\n186\n00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.732\nAnd the little LCD screens I\nwas talking about, they fail.\n\n187\n00:08:51.732 --> 00:08:54.286\nThey fail, they only last a couple\nof years, and they burn out.\n\n188\n00:08:54.286 --> 00:08:57.676\nThe backlights go out guaranteed\nwithin two to three years.\n\n189\n00:08:57.676 --> 00:09:00.080\nAnd then the LCD itself will\nfail within four years.\n\n190\n00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.610\nSo they do five year warranties on things,\n\n191\n00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.549\nthey were replacing those LCD screens\nleft and right, so it's kind of annoying.\n\n192\n00:09:04.549 --> 00:09:08.740\nThe little light system was designed to\nwork around that, just uses a couple LEDs.\n\n193\n00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.370\nBut the light system\nisn't very informative.\n\n194\n00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.310\nWell all of this is replacing the old way.\n\n195\n00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.920\nThe old way were beep codes.\n\n196\n00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.810\nBeep codes were super annoying,\nbut are still used today.\n\n197\n00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.143\nBecause with a beep code, what would\nhappen is the system would try and boot.\n\n198\n00:09:23.143 --> 00:09:24.976\nIt would encounter some kind of failure,\nand\n\n199\n00:09:24.976 --> 00:09:27.220\nthen it would emit a series of beeps,\nright?\n\n200\n00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.570\nAnd if it was a short beep followed by\nsome long beeps, it meant one thing.\n\n201\n00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:36.500\nAnd if it was three long beep, followed by\ntwo short beeps, that meant another thing.\n\n202\n00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.690\nAnd those beeps were designed\nto tell you what was wrong.\n\n203\n00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.820\nWell again, you've gotta be\nable to interpret those beeps.\n\n204\n00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.060\nSo I've got a few webpages pulled up here.\n\n205\n00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.860\nI've got HPE's webpage.\n\n206\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.593\nAnd they've got for\ntheir ProLient Servers,\n\n207\n00:09:48.593 --> 00:09:50.199\ntheir POST Error Messages and Beep Codes.\n\n208\n00:09:50.199 --> 00:09:53.474\nThat a lot of these are just straight\nup error messages, you'll see.\n\n209\n00:09:53.474 --> 00:09:57.538\nSo if you boot your server, and\nit's got a little LCD screen on it.\n\n210\n00:09:57.538 --> 00:10:00.591\nOr if you've got the monitor hooked up and\nthe monitor's able to display the error.\n\n211\n00:10:00.591 --> 00:10:03.347\nSee, that's other thing is,\nusually if you have a hardware error,\n\n212\n00:10:03.347 --> 00:10:06.310\nit doesn't get to the point where\nit initializes the video card.\n\n213\n00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:10.163\nSo you never see anything on the screen,\nso you can't see an error code.\n\n214\n00:10:10.163 --> 00:10:13.150\nBut if it can display on screen, it could\nactually tell you something like this.\n\n215\n00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:17.735\nAdvanced memory protection mode\nonline spare with advanced ECC.\n\n216\n00:10:17.735 --> 00:10:19.785\nHow many megabytes of\nsystem memory you have and\n\n217\n00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:22.400\nhow many megabytes of memory\nreserved fine line spare?\n\n218\n00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.450\nThis type message pops up, and\nit's letting you know what's going on.\n\n219\n00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:28.560\nAnd here it's saying, well it's just\nindicating that feature is turned on,\n\n220\n00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.340\nit's not actually an error, right?\n\n221\n00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.030\nIf I didn't see that message, it would\nindicate the feature is turned off.\n\n222\n00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.240\nOther ones are a little\nbit bigger of a problem,\n\n223\n00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.290\nwhere it's telling me that something\nis actually wrong with the system.\n\n224\n00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.720\nNow if it can initialize the video card,\nthose messages are usually really clear.\n\n225\n00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.310\nBut if it can't initialize the video\ncard then we get to the beep codes.\n\n226\n00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.130\nAnd I'm looking, see how most\nof these say audible beeps none?\n\n227\n00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.750\nThat's because the video cards were\nalready initialized at that point.\n\n228\n00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.930\nBut if we keep scrolling down,\nwe'll find one here shortly.\n\n229\n00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.452\nI know there's a handful of them in here,\n\n230\n00:10:58.452 --> 00:11:02.717\nwhere there actually are audible\nbeeps that are tied to a particular.\n\n231\n00:11:02.717 --> 00:11:04.510\nHere we are, got one right here.\n\n232\n00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.820\nTemperature Violation Error Message.\n\n233\n00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.333\nIf the temperature is too high for\nthe server, right?\n\n234\n00:11:10.333 --> 00:11:12.461\nSystem shutting down in\nx amount of seconds,\n\n235\n00:11:12.461 --> 00:11:14.316\nthat might be displayed on the screen.\n\n236\n00:11:14.316 --> 00:11:18.301\nAnd then we get an Audio Beep,\n1 long beep, 1 short beep.\n\n237\n00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:24.079\nSo that's what I'm hearing, if I'm hearing\nbeep, beep, beep, beep, like that.\n\n238\n00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:27.678\nThat's the long and the short\npause by that temperature failure.\n\n239\n00:11:27.678 --> 00:11:29.828\nSo I have to look that up because\notherwise I have no idea what\n\n240\n00:11:29.828 --> 00:11:30.603\nthat means, right?\n\n241\n00:11:30.603 --> 00:11:32.390\nSo those are beep codes.\n\n242\n00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:36.840\nNow the big problem with beep codes on\nservers is that server rooms are noisy.\n\n243\n00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.891\nEven small ones like ours,\nwe've got five racks behind me.\n\n244\n00:11:39.891 --> 00:11:43.118\nIt's not a giant server room,\nbut the servers are loud.\n\n245\n00:11:43.118 --> 00:11:46.129\nSo there could be a server omitting\na beep code right now, and\n\n246\n00:11:46.129 --> 00:11:47.379\nI might not even know it.\n\n247\n00:11:47.379 --> 00:11:49.457\nThe fans and other devices are so loud.\n\n248\n00:11:49.457 --> 00:11:53.163\nSo beep codes aren't necessarily the\ngreatest and that's why people try to move\n\n249\n00:11:53.163 --> 00:11:56.064\naway from them to things like\nthe light codes or the LCD screen.\n\n250\n00:11:56.064 --> 00:11:59.550\nSo those are all just different ways that\nthey can communicate those messages.\n\n251\n00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.450\nHere, I showed you some error\nnumbers as well as beep codes.\n\n252\n00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.776\nHere's an example of LCD screen messages.\n\n253\n00:12:08.776 --> 00:12:12.549\nThis is for a forge appliance and\non the forge appliances,\n\n254\n00:12:12.549 --> 00:12:17.252\nthey don't have a lot of face plate\nroom to communicate information to.\n\n255\n00:12:17.252 --> 00:12:19.562\nThey put a little LCD screen on there, but\n\n256\n00:12:19.562 --> 00:12:22.600\nthe error message that you\nsee are message codes.\n\n257\n00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.458\nSo if I'm getting a W1228 on the screen,\nright?\n\n258\n00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:29.674\nError 1228 or W1228,\nI know we've got a problem.\n\n259\n00:12:29.674 --> 00:12:31.390\nI can come to look it up here and\n\n260\n00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.870\nthe wrong battery has less\nthan 24 hours life on it.\n\n261\n00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:35.680\nAll right, I need to look at that.\n\n262\n00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.122\nI'm might need to condition that battery,\nreplace that battery.\n\n263\n00:12:38.122 --> 00:12:43.377\nOr if I get an E1214, my voltage\nregulator has failed, that's not good.\n\n264\n00:12:43.377 --> 00:12:44.596\nI need to get that fixed.\n\n265\n00:12:44.596 --> 00:12:49.132\nSo these messages are communicating to\nus in a very simple form through this\n\n266\n00:12:49.132 --> 00:12:49.927\nerror code.\n\n267\n00:12:49.927 --> 00:12:54.362\nBut I got to have a guide to be able to\ninterpret and figure out what that is.\n\n268\n00:12:54.362 --> 00:12:57.244\nAll right,\nnow once I know what the problem is,\n\n269\n00:12:57.244 --> 00:13:02.220\nif I've got a failed piece of hardware,\nI'm going to need to replace it.\n\n270\n00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.990\nIf I got an error code that\ntells me what the problem is,\n\n271\n00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.610\nthat makes life really easy.\n\n272\n00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:09.750\nWhat if I didn't get an error code\nthough or I look up the error code and\n\n273\n00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.650\nit doesn't match to anything?\n\n274\n00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:12.290\nWell now I need to try and\n\n275\n00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:16.720\nfind the problem, and here's where\nwe start our first major decision.\n\n276\n00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.332\nThe first major decision is do\nyou fix the problem or not?\n\n277\n00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:22.655\nAnd I don't mean we ignore the problem,\nbecause it's not gonna go away,\n\n278\n00:13:22.655 --> 00:13:23.920\nit's hardware, right?\n\n279\n00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.840\nI mean if you're server is under warranty,\nyou don't fix the problem.\n\n280\n00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.810\nYou call the vendor and\nthey fix the problem, right?\n\n281\n00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:34.689\nIf you want the system to stay under\nwarranty, they need to do the maintenance.\n\n282\n00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:36.511\nIt's a that's what I used\nto do back in the day.\n\n283\n00:13:36.511 --> 00:13:39.751\nI was a Compact and\nthen HP warranty technician.\n\n284\n00:13:39.751 --> 00:13:42.096\nSo I would go out to datacenters and\nfix servers.\n\n285\n00:13:42.096 --> 00:13:45.986\nAnd I was trained and\nauthorized to do that, since what I did.\n\n286\n00:13:45.986 --> 00:13:48.933\nAnd I would go to environments where\nyou had people were very smart,\n\n287\n00:13:48.933 --> 00:13:51.750\nthat they could easily fix\nthe server on their own.\n\n288\n00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:56.570\nBut they didn't, because they knew they\nwanted warranty support through us that\n\n289\n00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:57.860\nthey had to let us do it.\n\n290\n00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.660\nAnd we come out there and\ntake care of it for them.\n\n291\n00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.280\nAnd that's really the best way to\nhandle if a system's under warranty.\n\n292\n00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.004\nBecause remember the power supply\nissue I was telling you about?\n\n293\n00:14:06.004 --> 00:14:09.250\nHow the power supply and\nthe motherboard were bad?\n\n294\n00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.080\nIf I just tried replacing one component,\nI just cause more damage than good.\n\n295\n00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.368\nWell as a warranty tack, I could tell HP,\nhey, just give me the motherboard and\n\n296\n00:14:17.368 --> 00:14:19.295\nthe riser and both power supplies.\n\n297\n00:14:19.295 --> 00:14:21.539\nJust give me all those parts at once,\nand I'll go and\n\n298\n00:14:21.539 --> 00:14:23.040\nchange them all at the same time.\n\n299\n00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.890\nAnd I can do that because\nI had that authority.\n\n300\n00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:29.032\nIf you're the end user though, you're\ntalking to somebody on the phone and\n\n301\n00:14:29.032 --> 00:14:31.402\nthey're gonna say,\nwell have you rebooted the server?\n\n302\n00:14:31.402 --> 00:14:32.900\nHave you powered it on?\n\n303\n00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.809\nAnd after an hour of that\nthey finally say, okay,\n\n304\n00:14:34.809 --> 00:14:36.267\nI'm gonna send you one power supply.\n\n305\n00:14:36.267 --> 00:14:38.170\nAnd you say,\nwell I've got two and they say,\n\n306\n00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.936\nwell we wanna test to make sure it's one.\n\n307\n00:14:39.936 --> 00:14:42.924\nAnd so you get the one power supply,\nyou put it in and it burns out.\n\n308\n00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:46.054\nOkay, well we'll send you one more,\nmaybe that one was bad.\n\n309\n00:14:46.054 --> 00:14:49.194\nAnd all of a sudden, you're on like a\neight day down time on this server as you\n\n310\n00:14:49.194 --> 00:14:50.486\ngo through the whole process.\n\n311\n00:14:50.486 --> 00:14:51.972\nIt gets really frustrating, right?\n\n312\n00:14:51.972 --> 00:14:56.661\nBut if you have the right maintenance,\nif you got the escalated service,\n\n313\n00:14:56.661 --> 00:14:58.938\nif you do a four hour response time.\n\n314\n00:14:58.938 --> 00:15:01.447\nThose things are guaranteeing\nthat your server will be up\n\n315\n00:15:01.447 --> 00:15:02.864\nin a reasonable amount of time.\n\n316\n00:15:02.864 --> 00:15:05.670\nAnd that's important if you\nhave a mission critical system.\n\n317\n00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:09.330\nWhat most companies do today is\njust buy extra servers, right?\n\n318\n00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.896\nIf I have this server, I have one more\njust sitting on the ground over here.\n\n319\n00:15:11.896 --> 00:15:14.317\nAnd that way, if I have a failure,\nI can just swap it out and\n\n320\n00:15:14.317 --> 00:15:15.660\nthen fix this one at my leisure.\n\n321\n00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.380\nAnd I'm not really worried if it a takes\na couple extra days or whatever, right?\n\n322\n00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.445\nAnd I might even choose to fix it myself.\n\n323\n00:15:20.445 --> 00:15:22.536\nWhy keep them under warranty\nif I've got an extra?\n\n324\n00:15:22.536 --> 00:15:24.371\nI can always buy parts on eBay.\n\n325\n00:15:24.371 --> 00:15:28.271\nLord only knows what those parts have\nbeen through once they're on eBay, but\n\n326\n00:15:28.271 --> 00:15:30.199\nit is an option that a lot of people do.\n\n327\n00:15:30.199 --> 00:15:34.298\nAll right, if I do decide to fix it,\nthen comes the troubleshooting.\n\n328\n00:15:34.298 --> 00:15:38.043\nIf I've got an error code I can look that\nup, I can find out the part that's wrong,\n\n329\n00:15:38.043 --> 00:15:39.418\nI can order the replacement.\n\n330\n00:15:39.418 --> 00:15:41.856\nNow here's a challenge with\nordering replacements.\n\n331\n00:15:41.856 --> 00:15:43.956\nYou need to make sure\nyou get the right part.\n\n332\n00:15:43.956 --> 00:15:47.788\nIf you get the wrong part,\nit may not function to spec.\n\n333\n00:15:47.788 --> 00:15:49.788\nAnd it may cause other\nproblems in your system,\n\n334\n00:15:49.788 --> 00:15:52.096\nthere's no place that's as\nmore true than were fans.\n\n335\n00:15:52.096 --> 00:15:55.556\nAll server fans look the same, but\nthey were on a different speeds.\n\n336\n00:15:55.556 --> 00:15:59.243\nAnd they're rated for different air\nmovement and different airflow, and\n\n337\n00:15:59.243 --> 00:16:03.064\nthey point in different direction\nsometimes, And that can cause problems.\n\n338\n00:16:03.064 --> 00:16:07.023\nFortunately, all the major vendors,\nLenovo, Dell, HP.\n\n339\n00:16:07.023 --> 00:16:11.252\nThey do a really good job at putting part\nnumbers on every single component inside\n\n340\n00:16:11.252 --> 00:16:11.945\nof a system.\n\n341\n00:16:11.945 --> 00:16:15.048\nSo all you have to do is open up a system,\nlook at the part,\n\n342\n00:16:15.048 --> 00:16:18.182\nget the part number off of it,\nand go and order that part.\n\n343\n00:16:18.182 --> 00:16:22.331\nAnd if you order it from the vendor,\nyou know you'll get the right part.\n\n344\n00:16:22.331 --> 00:16:25.518\nYou go to Ebay, you can get it\na lot cheaper probably used,\n\n345\n00:16:25.518 --> 00:16:28.847\nso you dont know what the lifetime is and\nno warranty on that.\n\n346\n00:16:28.847 --> 00:16:32.790\nSo you're really kind of\ntaking a gamble on that.\n\n347\n00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:35.760\nProduct counterfeit parts that were\nout there too, were they'll say hey,\n\n348\n00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:41.750\nthis is an official Dell perc\ncontroller and it's 20 bucks.\n\n349\n00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.878\nAnd you know you could buy one from\nDell for $4,000 but this was $20, why?\n\n350\n00:16:45.878 --> 00:16:48.121\nWell typically a counterfeit, right?\n\n351\n00:16:48.121 --> 00:16:50.770\nThey do have those, that does happen.\n\n352\n00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:54.120\nSo you wanna make sure you're getting\nthe legitimate parts for your system.\n\n353\n00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.553\nNo where is that more true with the CPU.\n\n354\n00:16:55.553 --> 00:16:59.280\nI will not replace a CPU\nin a server with a use CPU.\n\n355\n00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.450\nI'll always go to the vendor, cuz there's\njust too many compatibility issues.\n\n356\n00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.396\nIt's too difficult to get\nmultiple CPUs to match like that,\n\n357\n00:17:05.396 --> 00:17:07.083\nit's not something you wanna do.\n\n358\n00:17:07.083 --> 00:17:10.767\nFortunately, those don't go bad all those\noften, so we don't have to worry about it.\n\n359\n00:17:10.767 --> 00:17:14.980\nAll right, one of the easiest ways to\ntroubleshoot is if you have extra parts.\n\n360\n00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.940\nIf you extra parts,\nyou can swap parts out and test it.\n\n361\n00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.873\nWell if you have extra parts,\nyou probably have an extra server.\n\n362\n00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:20.946\nIf you have an extra server,\n\n363\n00:17:20.946 --> 00:17:23.195\nyou probably moved it into\nproduction to replace this one.\n\n364\n00:17:23.195 --> 00:17:25.860\nSo not everybody has extra parts handy.\n\n365\n00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.770\nIf a warranty tech comes\nout they'll have it.\n\n366\n00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.990\nBut they can jump in and\nthey can start to swap things.\n\n367\n00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.985\nSo let's say that I've got this server and\nI'm dealing with an issue,\n\n368\n00:17:33.985 --> 00:17:38.458\nand CompTIA calls out a few fans,\nhard drives, RAM, back planes and battery.\n\n369\n00:17:38.458 --> 00:17:42.360\nNow notice in their list that they don't\nmention things like power supplies.\n\n370\n00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.608\nWhen we pull out a power supply,\neither one of these.\n\n371\n00:17:45.608 --> 00:17:48.250\nHere's the power supply,\nit's just a box, right?\n\n372\n00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.825\nI mention now inside of it there's things\nlike capacitors and the capacitors go bad.\n\n373\n00:17:51.825 --> 00:17:53.563\nIn fact, if you have a bad power supply,\n\n374\n00:17:53.563 --> 00:17:56.030\nit's almost always\nthe capacitors gone bad.\n\n375\n00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:59.290\nSo knowing that, doesn't it seem like\nthe right thing to do would be for\n\n376\n00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:03.510\nme to go out and learn how to use\na soldering iron and replace capacitors?\n\n377\n00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.248\nWell no,\nthese are very dangerous devices, right?\n\n378\n00:18:06.248 --> 00:18:08.014\nThe capacitors hold\nan electrical charge and\n\n379\n00:18:08.014 --> 00:18:09.877\nyou could shock yourself\nreally bad with them.\n\n380\n00:18:09.877 --> 00:18:14.797\nSo if you have a power supply that's\nfailed, the entire power supply is\n\n381\n00:18:14.797 --> 00:18:19.370\nwhat's considered an FRU,\na field replaceable unit, right?\n\n382\n00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.426\nI can replace this entire power supply,\nit's no big deal, just swap it out.\n\n383\n00:18:22.426 --> 00:18:26.920\nBut the components inside of it\nare considered non serviceable components.\n\n384\n00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.510\nAnd that doesn't mean that\nnobody can service them,\n\n385\n00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:30.230\nit means that you shouldn't, right?\n\n386\n00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.540\nThat you could really\nhurt yourself if you try.\n\n387\n00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.440\nSo instead,\nyou replace the entire component.\n\n388\n00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.747\nThe components that CompTIA is\ncalling out fans, hard drives, RAM,\n\n389\n00:18:39.747 --> 00:18:41.647\nback planes, and batteries.\n\n390\n00:18:41.647 --> 00:18:44.244\nThose are usually the ones that\nare considered field replaceable units.\n\n391\n00:18:44.244 --> 00:18:45.960\nOne's that are gonna be replaced by you.\n\n392\n00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.910\nAnything else needs to be\nsent back into the factory.\n\n393\n00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.690\nSo as we open up this server case,\n\n394\n00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.070\nwe're gonna find components\nthat shouldn't be messed with.\n\n395\n00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:58.190\nThe other thing to think about is whether\nor not the components are hot swappable.\n\n396\n00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.110\nThese power supplies have purple handles.\n\n397\n00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.560\nAnd in the HP world,\nthat means they're hot swappable.\n\n398\n00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.825\nNow I can't take them\nboth out like I just did,\n\n399\n00:19:04.825 --> 00:19:06.560\ncuz the server's gonna power off, right?\n\n400\n00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.560\nBut if I take them out one at a time and\nput another one in, then I can do it and\n\n401\n00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.090\nthe server never goes offline.\n\n402\n00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:15.190\nComponents like these can be replaced\neasily while the server's on.\n\n403\n00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:18.670\nBut not every component is, and\nas I get inside of this case,\n\n404\n00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:21.819\nwe're gonna find plenty of\ncomponents that aren't.\n\n405\n00:19:21.819 --> 00:19:25.220\nSo the first thing I needed to get is\nto open is to figure out how to do it.\n\n406\n00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.300\nSome servers have a literal handle\nright on the middle of pop up,\n\n407\n00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.150\nothers have levers an the front.\n\n408\n00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.147\nWith this one,\nit's a much simpler style and\n\n409\n00:19:32.147 --> 00:19:34.311\nthe one you servers usually\nsee it simple style.\n\n410\n00:19:34.311 --> 00:19:38.913\nWhich has a single securing screw right\nhere and then it's got a pressure button.\n\n411\n00:19:38.913 --> 00:19:42.348\nAnd I'm opening my tool kit and I'm\nforgetting that on a lot of HP servers.\n\n412\n00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:45.593\nThey actually include a little\ntorques hex allen wrench thing,\n\n413\n00:19:45.593 --> 00:19:49.089\nwhatever right on the back of the server\nthat I can use to open this up.\n\n414\n00:19:49.089 --> 00:19:52.407\nSo I'm just gonna do that real quick,\nand I'll grab that and\n\n415\n00:19:52.407 --> 00:19:54.740\nwe'll pop this thing open.\n\n416\n00:19:54.740 --> 00:20:01.330\nNow, This particular server was pulled\nout a production about an hour ago.\n\n417\n00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.038\nIf you just pull this\nserver out of production.\n\n418\n00:20:04.038 --> 00:20:06.469\nIf it's out of production for\njust a matter of minutes,\n\n419\n00:20:06.469 --> 00:20:09.328\nbe aware that some of the components\ninside of it are gonna be hot.\n\n420\n00:20:09.328 --> 00:20:15.182\nThat especially the CPU, and sometimes\nthe memory generate a good bit of heat.\n\n421\n00:20:15.182 --> 00:20:18.499\nAll right, the next thing you need to\ndo is here, it says, remove hood lock.\n\n422\n00:20:18.499 --> 00:20:20.633\nA hood lock screw which I just did, and\n\n423\n00:20:20.633 --> 00:20:25.630\nthen we've got to push down on this\nbutton and slide back to get it to open.\n\n424\n00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:27.320\nYour server may open differently, so\n\n425\n00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.580\ndefinitely take the time to read\nthe service manual it will explain it.\n\n426\n00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.199\nNow I know I highlighted this in\nthe server components episode.\n\n427\n00:20:33.199 --> 00:20:37.229\nBut on a lot of servers, there will be\na legend on the inside of the door and\n\n428\n00:20:37.229 --> 00:20:39.357\nthis one has it just like many others.\n\n429\n00:20:39.357 --> 00:20:43.243\nAnd a lot of times it will tell you in\nhere things that are half swappable.\n\n430\n00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:49.113\nBut it will also tell you additional\nerror codes and in many cases.\n\n431\n00:20:49.113 --> 00:20:52.839\nThis one, I don’t believe does,\nlet me just see, identifying things.\n\n432\n00:20:52.839 --> 00:20:56.710\nBut basically, it's telling me\nwhere all the components are.\n\n433\n00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:58.584\nSo if I'm hunting something down,\n\n434\n00:20:58.584 --> 00:21:02.276\nif I got an error code that told me\nmemory bank number three has failed.\n\n435\n00:21:02.276 --> 00:21:06.065\nI can come in here and identify which one\nof these is memory bank number three,\n\n436\n00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:09.580\nusing this chart right here,\nwhere it's got all the numbers.\n\n437\n00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.803\nAnd I can find the exact stick\nof RAM is causing my problem.\n\n438\n00:21:12.803 --> 00:21:15.012\nOr if a fan has failed, I can come in and\n\n439\n00:21:15.012 --> 00:21:19.450\nidentify exactly which hand is being\nreferenced and go in and replace that.\n\n440\n00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:22.314\nSo it definitely helps to be\nable to figure all that out.\n\n441\n00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:27.079\nBut there's also, see all these numbers,\nmost of the numbers are black circle.\n\n442\n00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:30.627\nBut some of them are grey circle and\nit's telling me those are LEDs, and\n\n443\n00:21:30.627 --> 00:21:32.940\nthe LED's help with trouble shooting.\n\n444\n00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:37.938\nSo here we've got a Fan 6 failure or\nAC power LED,\n\n445\n00:21:37.938 --> 00:21:42.108\na Fan 1 failure LED, Fan 7 failure LED.\n\n446\n00:21:42.108 --> 00:21:45.350\nEach of these LEDs are on the motherboard.\n\n447\n00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.278\nAnd when you apply power to the server,\nthose will light up.\n\n448\n00:21:48.278 --> 00:21:49.340\nAnd if one is lit up for\n\n449\n00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:53.120\na failure that lets you know that's\nthe fan that needs to be replaced.\n\n450\n00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.779\nSo I might not get a beep code or an on\nscreen error code or something like that.\n\n451\n00:21:56.779 --> 00:22:00.184\nBut these LEDs can help me to\nfigure out what that problem is.\n\n452\n00:22:00.184 --> 00:22:04.069\nSo these are all just additional\ntroubleshooting utilities that we've got\n\n453\n00:22:04.069 --> 00:22:05.230\ninside of the system.\n\n454\n00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:10.660\nNow once I look in here,\nlet's talk about hot swap again.\n\n455\n00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.950\nIf I'm dealing with a fan failure,\nwith HPE,\n\n456\n00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:16.550\nthey always label hot swap\nstuff with a purple handle.\n\n457\n00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:19.430\nMy hard drives on the front of\nthe server have purple handles on them.\n\n458\n00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:22.340\nI could replace a failed hard drive\nwithout even taking the server offline.\n\n459\n00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:26.010\nI can just pop it right out of the front\nand swap it, that's not a big deal.\n\n460\n00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:30.520\nBut the fans, I don't see\npurple handles on these, right?\n\n461\n00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.850\nThese are not hot swappable fans.\n\n462\n00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:37.529\nIf one of these fans were to fail, I would\nhave to schedule downtime for this server.\n\n463\n00:22:37.529 --> 00:22:41.593\nI would have to shut the server down and\nwhile it was off, go in and\n\n464\n00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:43.250\nreplace the fans.\n\n465\n00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.293\nThe main reason these aren't hot swappable\nis that they've actually got a cable.\n\n466\n00:22:46.293 --> 00:22:48.170\nWhich you can kind of\nsee running back here,\n\n467\n00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:50.170\nthat plugs right into the mother board.\n\n468\n00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.137\nSo I would have to unplug this\nconnector from the motherboard.\n\n469\n00:22:52.137 --> 00:22:54.507\nWhich HP won't let you do\nwhile it was powered on,\n\n470\n00:22:54.507 --> 00:22:57.112\nbecause you could short out\nthe motherboard, right?\n\n471\n00:22:57.112 --> 00:22:58.493\nOn ones that are hot swappable,\n\n472\n00:22:58.493 --> 00:23:01.729\nthey'll normally have little clips\nhere that you can squeeze and pick up.\n\n473\n00:23:01.729 --> 00:23:05.252\nAnd instead of a cable, they'll have\na little connector that looks kind of like\n\n474\n00:23:05.252 --> 00:23:06.951\nwha the power supply connector does.\n\n475\n00:23:06.951 --> 00:23:09.910\nBut just smaller,\nthat's plugging into a socket.\n\n476\n00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:10.850\nAnd because it's a socket,\n\n477\n00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:15.540\nyou can easily pop that right out, and\nit's hot swappable, no big deal, right?\n\n478\n00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.330\nThe fans typically come out pretty easily.\n\n479\n00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.480\nThey usually don't have screws and\n\n480\n00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:25.250\nthe reason is fans vibrate and if they're\nscrewed in it causes case vibration.\n\n481\n00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.281\nCase vibration eventually\nmakes it to the motherboard.\n\n482\n00:23:27.281 --> 00:23:31.799\nAnd motherboard vibration usually results\nin chip creep where the memory chips\n\n483\n00:23:31.799 --> 00:23:34.330\nslowly start to work their way out.\n\n484\n00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:35.580\nYou don't want that happening.\n\n485\n00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.874\nSo normally the fans are gonna be\nsecured with what look like screws, but\n\n486\n00:23:38.874 --> 00:23:40.658\nare actually little pieces of rubber.\n\n487\n00:23:40.658 --> 00:23:43.160\nIf I pull,\nlet me pull one of these out over here.\n\n488\n00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.042\nThis is a standalone fan,\nso it's easier to get out.\n\n489\n00:23:46.042 --> 00:23:47.477\nI'm gonna regret saying that, aren't I.\n\n490\n00:23:47.477 --> 00:23:49.869\nNo, it's gonna be a pain in the bottom.\n\n491\n00:23:49.869 --> 00:23:51.227\nIt's stuck under that middle rise.\n\n492\n00:23:51.227 --> 00:23:54.440\nAnyhow, we can see what we want,\nWell, it looks like a screw,\n\n493\n00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.880\nsee how I can actually\nbend that with my finger.\n\n494\n00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.920\nSo that's just a piece of\nrubber shaped like a screw.\n\n495\n00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.490\nSo that when it's inserted in this slot,\n\n496\n00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.840\nthe rubber absorbs\nthe vibration of the fan.\n\n497\n00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.120\nSo the fan is gonna vibrate,\nthere's no way to stop that,\n\n498\n00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.510\nit's a moving piece, right?\n\n499\n00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:12.897\nI mean you could do really\nexpensive bearings in it but\n\n500\n00:24:12.897 --> 00:24:14.391\notherwise it's gonna vibrate.\n\n501\n00:24:14.391 --> 00:24:18.903\nBut those little rubber screws\nallow it to vibrate in place and\n\n502\n00:24:18.903 --> 00:24:23.431\nit doesn't make it into the metal\ncasing itself, all right?\n\n503\n00:24:23.431 --> 00:24:25.547\nMake sure that when you\nput the fan back in, or\n\n504\n00:24:25.547 --> 00:24:27.630\nif ever replacement fan is going in.\n\n505\n00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.468\nPay attention to the direction,\nthey usually have a direction.\n\n506\n00:24:30.468 --> 00:24:34.966\nRemember, servers are bringing air in from\nthe front and taking it out the back.\n\n507\n00:24:34.966 --> 00:24:37.870\nIf you put the fan in backwards,\nwhat's it gonna do?\n\n508\n00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.160\nWell, it's not gonna reverse\nthe air flow for the whole thing,\n\n509\n00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.700\ncuz the other fans\nare going the right way.\n\n510\n00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.857\nWhat it's going to do is create a vortex,\nright?\n\n511\n00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:47.673\nThe vortex that's gonna\ncircle air like this, right?\n\n512\n00:24:47.673 --> 00:24:52.665\nHot air is going out, and that will be\nsucking the hot air back in over here and\n\n513\n00:24:52.665 --> 00:24:57.230\ncreating a vortex, recycling that\nhot air which is bad, right?\n\n514\n00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.768\nSo we definitely don't want that,\n\n515\n00:24:58.768 --> 00:25:01.245\nthat'll shorten the life time\nof our other components.\n\n516\n00:25:01.245 --> 00:25:05.170\nAnother thing to think about is that\nwhen you replace a bad hard drive.\n\n517\n00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:08.484\nI've got my hard drives, you can see\nthe back of the hard drives all up here.\n\n518\n00:25:08.484 --> 00:25:13.688\nI might have a bad hard drive, or the hard\ndrives plug into this backplane here.\n\n519\n00:25:13.688 --> 00:25:18.080\nThis backplane is, well, it's a riser\nhere, cuz it's mounted sideways, but\n\n520\n00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.515\nit's still a backplane.\n\n521\n00:25:19.515 --> 00:25:23.680\nIn that all four of these hard drives\nare plugged right into this backplane.\n\n522\n00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.690\nWhat happens if the backplane fails?\n\n523\n00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:30.217\nWell, the drives fail, if it's\na whole backplane all the drives fail.\n\n524\n00:25:30.217 --> 00:25:32.807\nBut if it's a single\nport on the backplane,\n\n525\n00:25:32.807 --> 00:25:37.429\nit might look like a drive failure but\nin actuality it's a backplane failure.\n\n526\n00:25:37.429 --> 00:25:42.189\nSo, that's why I keep an issue if I could\nconsistently see drive number three\n\n527\n00:25:42.189 --> 00:25:46.509\nfailing in this server, if I had to\nreplace drive number three twice or\n\n528\n00:25:46.509 --> 00:25:47.890\nthree times.\n\n529\n00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:51.009\nThat's a pattern, and\nit might not be drive number three.\n\n530\n00:25:51.009 --> 00:25:54.193\nIt might be port number\nthree on the backplane,\n\n531\n00:25:54.193 --> 00:25:57.707\nI might need to replace this\nboard right along here.\n\n532\n00:25:57.707 --> 00:26:01.787\nAnd this board is what's feeding power and\non this server it's,\n\n533\n00:26:01.787 --> 00:26:03.662\nthese are SATA drives right?\n\n534\n00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:05.599\nYeah, it's SATA connectivity\nto the systems,\n\n535\n00:26:05.599 --> 00:26:07.213\nthat's what it's feeding right here.\n\n536\n00:26:07.213 --> 00:26:09.305\nThis board is a very\nsimple piece of equipment,\n\n537\n00:26:09.305 --> 00:26:13.440\nit doesn't do a whole lot logic lines,\nso you wouldn't think they would fail.\n\n538\n00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:17.933\nBut the problem is the hot spot\nfunctionality that when you're\n\n539\n00:26:17.933 --> 00:26:19.892\npopping drives in and out.\n\n540\n00:26:19.892 --> 00:26:23.987\nIf I do that you'll, if you watch here on\nthe back plane you can see that little\n\n541\n00:26:23.987 --> 00:26:25.380\nport down there, right?\n\n542\n00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:30.579\nThere's plastic piece, every time I\npop a drive in it's pushing on that,\n\n543\n00:26:30.579 --> 00:26:34.466\nand when I hit the front\nlever it's applying pressure.\n\n544\n00:26:34.466 --> 00:26:38.343\nAnd if you watch carefully,\nyou probably can't see it on camera, but\n\n545\n00:26:38.343 --> 00:26:42.230\nthis little silicon wafer,\nit does flex a little bit, right?\n\n546\n00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:45.696\nIf you do that enough times, if you're\nconsistently taking a drive out and\n\n547\n00:26:45.696 --> 00:26:48.678\nputting a drive back in,\nwhich really you shouldn't be doing.\n\n548\n00:26:48.678 --> 00:26:51.738\nThe fact that I'm having to struggle with\nthis thing kind of shows you how tightly\n\n549\n00:26:51.738 --> 00:26:52.510\nthat goes in there.\n\n550\n00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:57.628\nThat's a lot of pressure, and that\nconnector, it's held on by solder, and\n\n551\n00:26:57.628 --> 00:27:03.020\nsolder really has no true strength to it,\nand so eventually it does fail.\n\n552\n00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:04.360\nNow they don't worry about that so\n\n553\n00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.720\nmuch at the factory, my goodness\nif I could just get this thing in.\n\n554\n00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.180\nThey don't worry about it so\nmuch at the factory,\n\n555\n00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.679\nbecause how often are we changing\nthe hard drives in our servers?\n\n556\n00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.120\nNot often, so\n\n557\n00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:18.170\nthey don't build a huge amount of strength\nbehind that because they don't have to.\n\n558\n00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:20.970\nBut if your scenario has led to\na situation where you have to replace\n\n559\n00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:23.070\nhard drives frequently,\nyou may break that, and\n\n560\n00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.478\nthen replacing the backplane\nis gonna be in your future.\n\n561\n00:27:25.478 --> 00:27:28.610\n&gt;&gt; Don, I know you talked about this\nin our server components section here.\n\n562\n00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:32.900\nBut another thing that they call out\nis something my first thought would be\n\n563\n00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.957\na 2032,\none those three folds CMOS batteries.\n\n564\n00:27:35.957 --> 00:27:38.992\nNow that's not the only battery\nthough that we have to worry about in\n\n565\n00:27:38.992 --> 00:27:39.980\nserver, right?\n\n566\n00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:43.505\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so we talked about the lifetime\nof components in another episode of how\n\n567\n00:27:43.505 --> 00:27:46.148\nfans go bad eventually,\nhard drives go bad eventually,\n\n568\n00:27:46.148 --> 00:27:47.817\npower supplies go bad eventually.\n\n569\n00:27:47.817 --> 00:27:50.740\nThe only one that's guaranteed to\ngo bad though are the batteries.\n\n570\n00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.590\nYou have batteries on your service and\nit will rate for a certain amount of time,\n\n571\n00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:55.282\ntypically three years.\n\n572\n00:27:55.282 --> 00:27:58.970\nSo the batteries that we're talking about,\nthe one Wes mentioned, the 2032,\n\n573\n00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.530\nthere's different types\nof batteries out there.\n\n574\n00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.600\nYou guys know,\nlike double As and triple As and\n\n575\n00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.220\nall the other crazy ones\nthat are out there.\n\n576\n00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:10.540\nBut most motherboards have standardized\non a CR2032 watch battery for\n\n577\n00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.100\ntheir clock, for their bios and CMOS and\n\n578\n00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.040\nall the other good stuff that\nneeds to depend on that clock.\n\n579\n00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.130\nSo when we take a look at\na mother board like this one,\n\n580\n00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:23.030\nusually somewhere if you look around, in\nthis one I don't have to look too far cuz\n\n581\n00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:29.430\nit's right here by the CPU, you'll\nfind a circular CR2032 watch battery.\n\n582\n00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:33.520\nNow, just because I said it's\na 2032 don't take my word for it.\n\n583\n00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.150\nIt might not be,\nit might be a different battery types, so\n\n584\n00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:38.400\nalways double check that.\n\n585\n00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.040\nAnd sometimes, they're removable,\nsometimes they're not.\n\n586\n00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.744\nAt first glance, this one one\nlooks removable, it is all right,\n\n587\n00:28:43.744 --> 00:28:45.380\nthis one is removable.\n\n588\n00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.010\nAt first glance,\nit looks removable because it is.\n\n589\n00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:52.050\nAnd [LAUGH] if it's removable,\nthen we just can go in there and\n\n590\n00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:54.810\npry that with a simple screwdriver.\n\n591\n00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:58.280\nNow If you're gonna actually start\nmanipulating components do remember\n\n592\n00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:02.610\nto do the thing that I'm not doing,\nwhich is wear an ESD wristband.\n\n593\n00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:05.402\nUp until this point I haven't\nreally touched any components, so\n\n594\n00:29:05.402 --> 00:29:07.545\nI haven't put myself at risk,\nbut I'm about to.\n\n595\n00:29:07.545 --> 00:29:10.097\nSo I'm gonna get out my ESD wristband.\n\n596\n00:29:10.097 --> 00:29:13.257\nDo you guys remember this guy\nfrom one of our other episodes.\n\n597\n00:29:13.257 --> 00:29:15.020\nI have little tiny wrist, so\n\n598\n00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:19.060\nI have to struggle with this\nthing to get it adjusted right.\n\n599\n00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.917\nBut once it's on I can attach this\nto the case to ground myself out and\n\n600\n00:29:21.917 --> 00:29:25.097\nthat's important especially since\nI'm messing with a battery, right?\n\n601\n00:29:25.097 --> 00:29:26.810\nYou think a battery holds a charge?\n\n602\n00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:29.287\nWell it should,\nthat's what it's job is, right?\n\n603\n00:29:29.287 --> 00:29:32.379\nNow, a 2032 is nothing,\nyou could swallow one you'd be fine but\n\n604\n00:29:32.379 --> 00:29:33.535\ndon't quote me on that.\n\n605\n00:29:33.535 --> 00:29:38.846\n[LAUGH] But as far as an electric shock,\nit's not really a big deal.\n\n606\n00:29:38.846 --> 00:29:40.594\nBut I'm not worried about the battery,\n\n607\n00:29:40.594 --> 00:29:43.380\nthat's easy to replace I''m\nworried about the mother board.\n\n608\n00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.160\nMother board, that's expensive that\ngonna cost me a little bit more.\n\n609\n00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.832\nSo now I've got my ESD wristband,\n\n610\n00:29:47.832 --> 00:29:51.187\nI'm gonna attach it to a nice solid\nplace here on the case somewhere.\n\n611\n00:29:51.187 --> 00:29:55.688\nAnd you always wanna find some place were\nyou'll recognize if it pops off, right?\n\n612\n00:29:55.688 --> 00:29:58.819\nBecause I have had it before were you\nattach it, and you think you're fine, and\n\n613\n00:29:58.819 --> 00:30:01.230\nthen after a few moments,\nit pops off and you don't notice.\n\n614\n00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.801\nBut anyway I got a nice,\ngood spot right there on the chest,\n\n615\n00:30:03.801 --> 00:30:04.784\nI was able to click to.\n\n616\n00:30:04.784 --> 00:30:06.317\nAll right, so now that I'm grounded out,\n\n617\n00:30:06.317 --> 00:30:08.114\nI can come over here and\nI can pop this battery out.\n\n618\n00:30:08.114 --> 00:30:11.890\nUsually there's just a lever that\nyou can apply some pressure to, and\n\n619\n00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:13.426\nthe battery will pop loose.\n\n620\n00:30:13.426 --> 00:30:18.186\nSo if I do that again, I'm just gonna take\nthis screwdriver and apply a little bit of\n\n621\n00:30:18.186 --> 00:30:23.229\npressure, and that one will pop right out,\nand once it's out, there's the battery.\n\n622\n00:30:23.229 --> 00:30:26.626\nPay attention to\nthe orientation of that battery,\n\n623\n00:30:26.626 --> 00:30:31.841\nmine was set with the positive side up,\nyours might be set positive side down.\n\n624\n00:30:31.841 --> 00:30:35.300\nI've seen that on some Cisco equipment,\nnormally the positive side is up,\n\n625\n00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.800\nso just be aware that\nthere's an orientation.\n\n626\n00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.662\nAnd once its popped out, its kinda hard\nto remember exactly how that's supposed\n\n627\n00:30:40.662 --> 00:30:42.447\nto be,\nunless you have another server to look at.\n\n628\n00:30:42.447 --> 00:30:46.293\nSo always pay attention to that,\nbut you can buy these at any store,\n\n629\n00:30:46.293 --> 00:30:50.478\nthey're all created equal, you can go\nto any convenient store really and\n\n630\n00:30:50.478 --> 00:30:54.800\nbuy these things, assuming it's\na consistent model number, right?\n\n631\n00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.039\nIf it's a rare battery you might\nneed to get it from the vendor.\n\n632\n00:30:57.039 --> 00:31:00.141\nAnd to maintain warranty support, you\nshould probably get the vendor to replace\n\n633\n00:31:00.141 --> 00:31:01.562\nthis anyway instead of you doing it.\n\n634\n00:31:01.562 --> 00:31:05.341\n&gt;&gt; Don, I know that a place where\nwe've both worked together before,\n\n635\n00:31:05.341 --> 00:31:09.830\nyou had me replace these and\nyou mentioned that three year lifecycle.\n\n636\n00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:13.221\nAnd I made the comment back\nthen well Don wait a second,\n\n637\n00:31:13.221 --> 00:31:17.445\nI don't see time clocks changing here,\nwhy are we replacing them?\n\n638\n00:31:17.445 --> 00:31:19.070\nThese batteries all look good and\n\n639\n00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:22.108\nyou made the mention that it's\npreventative maintenance.\n\n640\n00:31:22.108 --> 00:31:25.535\nLet's change them now, because then we\ncan ensure that they're gonna be good.\n\n641\n00:31:25.535 --> 00:31:29.875\n&gt;&gt; Right better to change it on your\nschedule than on some unknown schedule.\n\n642\n00:31:29.875 --> 00:31:32.463\nCuz what's gonna happen is\nonce your system is booted\n\n643\n00:31:32.463 --> 00:31:35.453\nup you're probably syncing off\nof a time server and all that,\n\n644\n00:31:35.453 --> 00:31:39.505\nso you probably won't even notice if the\ntime gets wrong until you reboot, right?\n\n645\n00:31:39.505 --> 00:31:43.251\nSo maybe you've got some maintenance\nwindow coming up where you told your boss\n\n646\n00:31:43.251 --> 00:31:45.644\nhey, I need to install this update,\nand reboot.\n\n647\n00:31:45.644 --> 00:31:48.019\nIt's just a quick reboot,\nit'll take me five minutes.\n\n648\n00:31:48.019 --> 00:31:49.614\nI need five minutes of downtime.\n\n649\n00:31:49.614 --> 00:31:53.757\nAnd you reboot it And all of your config\nis messed up because the BIOS clock got\n\n650\n00:31:53.757 --> 00:31:58.094\nscrewed up or whatever and now you got to\ntrack down a battery and replace it, and\n\n651\n00:31:58.094 --> 00:32:02.690\nall of a sudden that five minute\nwindow becomes a 15 minute window.\n\n652\n00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:04.810\nIf you had known about the battery,\nif you replaced it,\n\n653\n00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:06.290\nthat wouldn't have been a problem, right?\n\n654\n00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:09.925\nAnd that isn't the only battery\non your system or it might be.\n\n655\n00:32:09.925 --> 00:32:13.810\nBut usually if you have a RAID controller\nyour going to have battery back\n\n656\n00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.280\nright cache controller.\n\n657\n00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.990\nAnd so when you look at a RAID controller\nlike the one that I've got back here on\n\n658\n00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:21.130\nthe server, it's actually get\na little atom board here from memory.\n\n659\n00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:25.090\nAnd there'll typically\nthe battery attached to it also.\n\n660\n00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:28.460\nSometimes that battery's replaceable,\nsometimes it is not.\n\n661\n00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.690\nSometimes it's removable and\nsometimes it's not.\n\n662\n00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:33.940\nIf it's not removable,\nyou'll have to replace the entire board,\n\n663\n00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.910\nwhich if it's under warranty\nit's not a big deal.\n\n664\n00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:38.570\nIf it's not under warranty though that\n\n665\n00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:41.010\nusually means you're exceeding\nthe lifetime of the server.\n\n666\n00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:44.610\nThey don't expect you to run these\nservers for ten years or whatever.\n\n667\n00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.460\nBut in this case,\nif I wanna get to that board,\n\n668\n00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:50.540\nI'm gonna have to disconnect this\ncable from the RAID controller.\n\n669\n00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.900\nSo I'll just pop that one off, and\n\n670\n00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:57.730\nI do need to remember where this is\nplugged in because when I finish,\n\n671\n00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:00.960\nI need to put this thing back the way that\nI found it or it's not gonna work right.\n\n672\n00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:05.530\nSo I plug this storage connection\ninto the other connector that can\n\n673\n00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:07.340\ncause a problem with the drive ID's.\n\n674\n00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:12.110\nHP servers will actually recover from that\njust fine but some other vendors don't.\n\n675\n00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:15.420\nSo just a word to the wise there.\n\n676\n00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.610\nLet me go ahead and\nremove this whole riser board.\n\n677\n00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.120\nUnfortunately I can't\nget the RAID controller\n\n678\n00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.300\nout while it's still\nmounted in the system.\n\n679\n00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:27.040\nSo I've got to come in here and\nunscrew this and get it undone,\n\n680\n00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.980\nand then this whole board will come out.\n\n681\n00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.320\nOn some systems there'll actually be\na lever over here that you crank and\n\n682\n00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.430\nthat will release this board to pop out.\n\n683\n00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:40.570\nOn this one though, we're just\ngonna come straight up with it, and\n\n684\n00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:43.840\nit pops right out just\nlike that easy peasy.\n\n685\n00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.620\nNow once that's done, now I can get this\nRAID controller out of here a lot easier.\n\n686\n00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.990\nIt should just pop right out\ndoesn't even have a screw.\n\n687\n00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.280\nAnd so we'll get that the rest\nof the way out there we go.\n\n688\n00:33:55.990 --> 00:34:00.580\nAnd I've managed to catch my ESD wrist\nband which is why I don't like them.\n\n689\n00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.290\nBut now that I've got it out, I can take\na better look at the RAID controller, and\n\n690\n00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:04.820\nkind of what's going on.\n\n691\n00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:08.530\nAnd sometimes you'll see a very\nobvious battery stuck on it.\n\n692\n00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:11.460\nOn this one, I actually don't\nsee a very obvious battery.\n\n693\n00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.825\nSo I'm hoping that it is\nunderneath this card.\n\n694\n00:34:13.825 --> 00:34:18.146\nAnd so I'm gonna pop this card out and\nflip it over.\n\n695\n00:34:18.146 --> 00:34:24.080\nAnd, all right, so looking at this card,\nthis is the memory, right?\n\n696\n00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.520\nSo I've got, this is the right cache.\n\n697\n00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.040\nIt's been added on to the board,\nbut I'm not seeing a battery.\n\n698\n00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.310\nAnd so when you look at it and\n\n699\n00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:35.870\nyou don't see a battery on the system\nthat usually means one of two things.\n\n700\n00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:37.660\nEither one, the battery is integrated.\n\n701\n00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:40.150\nThere's several parts here that\nare kinda covered that I can't see,\n\n702\n00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:43.540\nand the battery could be under one\nof those and it's not removable.\n\n703\n00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:47.310\nOr two, it could mean that\nthe battery has been removed.\n\n704\n00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:50.070\nThat somebody's already\ntaken it off of this system.\n\n705\n00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:52.220\nNow, I don't know if that's the case.\n\n706\n00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:54.500\nI could have ordered it without a battery,\nI suppose [INAUDIBLE].\n\n707\n00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.300\nI forgot to put this in upside down.\n\n708\n00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.960\nIt's not always gonna be the case.\n\n709\n00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.007\nBut you'll notice there's a few extra\nconnectors on this RAID controller and\n\n710\n00:35:01.007 --> 00:35:03.419\npotentially the battery was\ndesigned to attach the outside.\n\n711\n00:35:03.419 --> 00:35:07.459\nSo I need to pull up the vendor\ndocumentation on this to find that out and\n\n712\n00:35:07.459 --> 00:35:12.252\nmake sure that there's a connector right\non here that looks like it's geared up for\n\n713\n00:35:12.252 --> 00:35:14.770\na ribbon connector to run to something.\n\n714\n00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:16.910\nYou don't normally have a ribbon\nconnector to a battery though and\n\n715\n00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:17.960\nthe same thing here.\n\n716\n00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:18.910\nSo I don't think that's the case.\n\n717\n00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:22.310\nThis one's more than likely going to have\nan integrated battery right on it and\n\n718\n00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:26.672\nthat way, well it can't be removed\nwhich means I can't replace it.\n\n719\n00:35:26.672 --> 00:35:29.320\nI'm gonna have to rely on the RAID\ncontroller diagnostics tell me about\n\n720\n00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.480\nthe battery I'm just wanna\nmake sure that it's okay.\n\n721\n00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.120\nAnd if it is then I don't worry about it.\n\n722\n00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.610\nBut if it's not okay I'll likely\nsend the whole board in for\n\n723\n00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:37.430\nservicing which can be\na bit of a challenge.\n\n724\n00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.520\nAll right, so\n\n725\n00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.380\nthose are a couple of example of the\nbatteries that we're gonna find in there.\n\n726\n00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:46.560\nOne other type of battery that you may\nhave that I know this one doesn't is that\n\n727\n00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:51.530\nif you have a remote access board\nin it like a DRAC or an ILO board.\n\n728\n00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:55.155\nThat sometimes they'll have\ntheir own battery too so\n\n729\n00:35:55.155 --> 00:36:00.830\nthat this is what we do safety of parts\nthat I put the cover right by Wes's feet.\n\n730\n00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:05.970\nSo but this is where, we need to be\naware that if the server loses power\n\n731\n00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:08.560\nthe remote access board loses power also,\nright?\n\n732\n00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.480\nSo it might have it's own battery, it's\nown internal battery so the remote access\n\n733\n00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:16.160\nboard can stay awake and I can reach in\nand try and connect, and maintain it.\n\n734\n00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.070\nIf that's the case that's another\nbattery we need to be a part of our\n\n735\n00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:20.440\nmaintenance schedule.\n\n736\n00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.750\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, well a lot of\nfascinating information here.\n\n737\n00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:26.230\nA lot of definitely a lot of moving\nparts that we've gotta consider here.\n\n738\n00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:29.630\nNow I am looking at the clock, and I do\nsee that we're running out of time, but\n\n739\n00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.670\nwe still got a little\nbit more to talk about.\n\n740\n00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:35.210\nSo what do you say, we wrap this one up,\nmaybe come back into a part four.\n\n741\n00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:38.110\nGive you a chance to fit some more\nof the concepts in here that you\n\n742\n00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:39.160\nstill need to talk about?\n\n743\n00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.670\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, just a couple loose\nends to get through on this one, and\n\n744\n00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:43.010\nthen we'll wrap up from there.\n\n745\n00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:44.780\n&gt;&gt; All right, that sounds good,\ngood place to stop.\n\n746\n00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:48.060\nThanks for being here Don, and thank you\nto you the viewer watching out there.\n\n747\n00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.660\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI'm been your host Wes Brian.\n\n748\n00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:51.630\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n749\n00:36:51.630 -->

00:00:08.399\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:11.011\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITproTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.270\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome back to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.620\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.280\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\nthrough our Server Plus Comp TS Series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.220\nThis is SK0004.\n\n9\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.040\nAnd joining us back for, yes,\na part four in server maintenance,\n\n10\n00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.660\nis none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.800\nDon, how you doing sir?\n\n12\n00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.160\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I like to maintain things.\n\n13\n00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.010\nWhat can I say?\n\n14\n00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.905\nIt's a critical piece\nof what we do everyday.\n\n15\n00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:39.341\nSo, we're back again with what will\nbe the last episode, I promise,\n\n16\n00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:42.212\non stuff we need to do to maintain or\nservers.\n\n17\n00:00:42.212 --> 00:00:46.039\nAnd this last one is kind of made\nup of a mixture of things, but\n\n18\n00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.754\nlets just start off with air flow, right?\n\n19\n00:00:48.754 --> 00:00:49.865\nAir flow and dust.\n\n20\n00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:52.258\nDust is the enemy of the server, right?\n\n21\n00:00:52.258 --> 00:00:55.678\nDust is, we don't think much\nof it as human beings, right?\n\n22\n00:00:55.678 --> 00:00:59.513\nDust, it might annoy you,\nyou sneeze a bit, your hands get dusty,\n\n23\n00:00:59.513 --> 00:01:01.206\nyou wash your hands, right?\n\n24\n00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:04.502\nBut to a server,\ndust actually does a few different things.\n\n25\n00:01:04.502 --> 00:01:06.640\nFirst, it gets sucked in by the fans,\nright?\n\n26\n00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.724\nYou got these high powered fans in your\nservers constantly sucking in air which\n\n27\n00:01:09.724 --> 00:01:11.110\ncan bring in dust.\n\n28\n00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.170\nAnd that air is being blown\nacross electrical components.\n\n29\n00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.000\nLots of corners and edges and\n\n30\n00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.520\nlittle cables that can catch the dust and\nhold the dust.\n\n31\n00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.840\nSo it doesn't leave.\n\n32\n00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.810\nIf the dust just passed right\nthrough the server, went in and out,\n\n33\n00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.490\nit's no big deal, right?\n\n34\n00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.192\nBut it doesn't do that.\n\n35\n00:01:27.192 --> 00:01:30.320\nThe dust deposits,\nit stays inside of the server.\n\n36\n00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.620\nAnd when it does that,\nit can cause a few different problems.\n\n37\n00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.960\nThe most common problem is\nit can obstruct air flow.\n\n38\n00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.780\nServers expect to have free\nair flow from front to back.\n\n39\n00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.770\nWell, if the front grille of\nthe server is packed full of dust,\n\n40\n00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.140\nthat's not gonna work out is it, right?\n\n41\n00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.580\nBut if air can pass through\nthe front grille, it can get inside.\n\n42\n00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.470\nWell, once it gets inside,\n\n43\n00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.880\nthe air is supposed to be flowing\nall over memory sticks and CPU.\n\n44\n00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.192\nBut if the CPU is caked in dust\nthe air isn't flowing over the CPU.\n\n45\n00:01:59.192 --> 00:02:00.840\nThe air's flowing over the dust and\n\n46\n00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.290\nit's not cooling the CPU\nthe way it's supposed to do it.\n\n47\n00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.030\nAnd so, the devices run hotter\nthan they're intended to.\n\n48\n00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.220\n&gt;&gt; Now, the way I do this at home with my\nPC is going to be a lot different than\n\n49\n00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.407\nthe way you'll do in a server closet.\n\n50\n00:02:10.407 --> 00:02:11.535\n[LAUGH] Why is that?\n\n51\n00:02:11.535 --> 00:02:14.665\nWell, I can turn my PC off and\nit's no problem, right?\n\n52\n00:02:14.665 --> 00:02:18.795\nI might not be able watch or I don't know,\nstream movies or something like that.\n\n53\n00:02:18.795 --> 00:02:20.425\nBut I know we can't turn the server off,\nright?\n\n54\n00:02:20.425 --> 00:02:21.085\nWe want up time.\n\n55\n00:02:21.085 --> 00:02:24.260\nSo, Don, how do we deal with dust\nin our server closets when we\n\n56\n00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.040\nreally don't wanna be\npowering our servers off?\n\n57\n00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, there's two ways.\n\n58\n00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.830\nThere's one way where you\ncan power it off, right?\n\n59\n00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.130\nIf it's not a mission critical server or\nwhatever, you can cut power.\n\n60\n00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.590\nBut if it's a critical server,\n\n61\n00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.270\nyou've gotta stop dust from getting to\nthe server in the first place, all right?\n\n62\n00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.630\nAnd there's a few different\napproaches to that.\n\n63\n00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.700\nThere's some that are reasonable,\nsome that are pretty crazy.\n\n64\n00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.740\nBut on the reasonable side, you should\nhave HEPA filters in your server room.\n\n65\n00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.620\nHEPA filters are air filters\nthat are designed to take dust\n\n66\n00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.510\nparticles out of the air, right?\n\n67\n00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.400\nAnd the other thing is, and\nmany data centers have this,\n\n68\n00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.530\nis never unbox equipment\nin your server room.\n\n69\n00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.550\nA lot of people, they get a new server and\nwhat do they do?\n\n70\n00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.740\nIt comes in a big box, they cart it right\ninto the server room, they open the box\n\n71\n00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.560\nright there in the server room, they take\nthe server out throw it on the rack.\n\n72\n00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.200\nMakes sense, that's where it's going.\n\n73\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.910\nBut the problem is that box.\n\n74\n00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.290\nWhen you cut the box, the box is covered\nin dust just in and of itself, but\n\n75\n00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.950\nthe moment you start cutting it,\ncutting the tape,\n\n76\n00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.130\nopening it up,\nyou're getting dust everywhere.\n\n77\n00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.080\nA lot of the dust in the server\nroom comes from those boxes.\n\n78\n00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.150\nSo most data centers have a zero box rule.\n\n79\n00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.870\nNo cardboard boxes allowed\nin the data center.\n\n80\n00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.820\nYou open the server outside of the data\ncenter, you throw the server on a cart and\n\n81\n00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.120\nyou wheel it in after it's been opened.\n\n82\n00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.640\nNow, that policy can extend\na little bit further.\n\n83\n00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.210\nAnd I know not everybody's in as weird\na place as Florida, like we are.\n\n84\n00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.850\nBut here in Florida,\nwe have a climate problem, right?\n\n85\n00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.500\nOur climate problem is,\nif I order a server today, and\n\n86\n00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.273\nlet's say I order it from Lenovo.\n\n87\n00:03:50.273 --> 00:03:54.500\nWell, I'm going to order it from\na company like CDW or somebody,\n\n88\n00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.120\nand they're going to ship it to me UPS,\nFedEx, Postal Service, whatever.\n\n89\n00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.780\nLet's just say UPS.\n\n90\n00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.570\nThe UPS guys are gonna get that box, and\n\n91\n00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.430\nthey're gonna stick it in the back of\ntheir truck, their big brown truck.\n\n92\n00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.840\nTheir big brown truck that\ndoesn't have air conditioning.\n\n93\n00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.570\nAnd it's gonna drive around\noutside as they run the route,\n\n94\n00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.160\ndelivering packages until they come to me.\n\n95\n00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.960\nNow, during that time,\nthe servers temperature\n\n96\n00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.170\nis going to raise to the temperature\noutside, which is well within limits.\n\n97\n00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.030\nIt's not a bad thing, right?\n\n98\n00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.612\nI'm not saying UPS should be\ndoing anything different.\n\n99\n00:04:22.612 --> 00:04:28.020\nBut if it 95 degrees outside,\nthe server's gonna raise up to 95 degrees.\n\n100\n00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.050\nMaybe hotter, or maybe colder,\ndepending on whether it's in the shade or\n\n101\n00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.530\nin the sun and whatever, but\nwell let's just say it hits 95 degrees.\n\n102\n00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.740\nAlso, outside there's a certain\nlevel of humidity in Florida.\n\n103\n00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.140\nIt's usually what like 10,000%?\n\n104\n00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.190\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n105\n00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.610\n&gt;&gt; So its a wall of water out there.\n\n106\n00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.090\nAnd the server is going to basically\nbe stored in that type of environment.\n\n107\n00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.360\nWhen it comes inside and\n\n108\n00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.300\ntake it to my data center,\nwhat it's like in my data center?\n\n109\n00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.390\nIn my data center its 65 degrees.\n\n110\n00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.830\nAlmost 30 degrees or maybe even a clear\n30 degrees cooler than outside.\n\n111\n00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.480\nAnd the humidity is extremely low because\nair conditioning, just through the act or\n\n112\n00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.500\nair conditioning removes\nmoisture from the air.\n\n113\n00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.080\nSo it's very dry in the data center.\n\n114\n00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.971\nif I take that server out of the box and\n\n115\n00:05:10.971 --> 00:05:15.119\nits 95 degrees coming from a high\nhumidity environment what's gonna happen?\n\n116\n00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:17.604\nThe metal is gonna sweat,\nit's gonna perspire.\n\n117\n00:05:17.604 --> 00:05:20.161\nAs it rapidly cools,\nwater is gonna gather on it.\n\n118\n00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:23.710\nAnd now I've got water on my server,\nand that's not a good idea right?\n\n119\n00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.251\nYou don't want water on your server,\n\n120\n00:05:25.251 --> 00:05:27.527\nespecially on the electrical\ncomponents inside of it.\n\n121\n00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:30.014\nAnd so, if you take that server and\nyou chuck it right on the rack,\n\n122\n00:05:30.014 --> 00:05:30.840\nwhats gonna happen?\n\n123\n00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.310\nIt's gonna short out.\n\n124\n00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.130\nit's gonna short out and\npotentially damage other servers and\n\n125\n00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.640\nother systems, too.\n\n126\n00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.250\nSo, in most data centers,\nthey have a policy.\n\n127\n00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.720\nWhen new servers come in,\nthe box gets delivered,\n\n128\n00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.500\ngets opened up outside of the data center,\nthe server gets taken out of the box and\n\n129\n00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.300\nstuck in a shelf and\nit sits there for 24 hours.\n\n130\n00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.797\nIt sits there for 24 hours to acclimate,\nto reach the same level of temperature,\n\n131\n00:05:54.797 --> 00:05:59.284\nnormalization of temperature,\nas what we have in the data center.\n\n132\n00:05:59.284 --> 00:06:02.209\nAnd then it gets brought in\nonce it's closer to that level.\n\n133\n00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:04.916\nAnd that way, we don't have perspiration,\nwe don't have rapid heating or\n\n134\n00:06:04.916 --> 00:06:06.750\ncooling of the device,\nand it reaches that level.\n\n135\n00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.100\nWe have to worry about\nthat stuff in Florida.\n\n136\n00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.200\nIf you're in Alaska,\nit's probably not a problem, right?\n\n137\n00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.660\nBut in Florida, it is a problem.\n\n138\n00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.560\nSo those are things to think about.\n\n139\n00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.030\nThat helps to keep dust out.\n\n140\n00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.090\nThe other source of dust is\ngoing to be our clothing, right?\n\n141\n00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.730\nThe clothing that we wear.\n\n142\n00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.530\nIn a highly sensitive environment\nwith truly mission critical systems,\n\n143\n00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.840\nyou may be required to wear a jumper\nbefore you go into the data center.\n\n144\n00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.550\nLike if you've ever seen the movie ET or\nwhatever when they all put on the suits,\n\n145\n00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.600\nthat kind of thing.\n\n146\n00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.780\nNot full on clean room,\nI'm not talking about the full helmets and\n\n147\n00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.860\nall, but a jumper just to keep\nthe clothing dust that you generate\n\n148\n00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.570\nkind of contained, right?\n\n149\n00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.670\nNow, most people don't go that far.\n\n150\n00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.500\nInstead, what they do is they schedule\nroutine, physical maintenance\n\n151\n00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.720\nof the systems where you do power\nthe servers down and you vacuum them out.\n\n152\n00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.920\nYou can vacuum a server out.\n\n153\n00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.840\nYou can take the dust out of them and\nnow they're up and operational again,\n\n154\n00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.300\nas long as you know to do it.\n\n155\n00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.370\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don, you've been stressing ESD.\n\n156\n00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.230\nESD.\n\n157\n00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.030\nAnd I mean prevention of it,\nnot injecting it into your server.\n\n158\n00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.420\nLet's be careful on that one.\n\n159\n00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.659\nI know vacuums, right?\n\n160\n00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:09.180\nA little bit about vacuums.\n\n161\n00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.330\nAnd I know I'm not going to just go\nright over to our closet where we have\n\n162\n00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.950\na one horse shop vac, bring it in and\nstart vacuuming things out,\n\n163\n00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.670\ncuz we have to worry\nabout static discharge.\n\n164\n00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.400\nWhat kind of vacuum should we think about?\n\n165\n00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.350\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nthe best option is canned air.\n\n166\n00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.040\nIf you have canned air,\nthat works out great.\n\n167\n00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.480\nBut a lot of times that dust\ngets wedged in there, and\n\n168\n00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.390\ndoesn't really do a great job.\n\n169\n00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.470\nBut the other problem with\ncanned air in a data center,\n\n170\n00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.370\nis it doesn't get rid of the dust,\nit just moves it somewhere else.\n\n171\n00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.050\nSo you're blowing the dust\nout of your server, and\n\n172\n00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.470\nit just gets sucked into some\nother server somewhere else.\n\n173\n00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.760\nSo a vacuum will actually\ntake that dust out.\n\n174\n00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.760\nBut ESD is a problem, like Wes mentioned.\n\n175\n00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.801\nIf you take a regular consumer vacuum, and\n\n176\n00:07:43.801 --> 00:07:46.534\nyou start vacuuming your\nserver it's discharging ESD.\n\n177\n00:07:46.534 --> 00:07:50.203\nThe little bristles on the bristle brush,\nit's not a good situation and\n\n178\n00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:52.922\nyou'll end up doing damage sooner or\nlater, right?\n\n179\n00:07:52.922 --> 00:07:55.869\nBut you do need to vacuum it out\nbecause if dust builds up on the fans,\n\n180\n00:07:55.869 --> 00:07:58.146\nnow the fans are having to\nwork harder than normal and\n\n181\n00:07:58.146 --> 00:07:59.730\nthat will shorten their lifetime.\n\n182\n00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.370\nOr if you have a heat sink and\ndust gets clogged in it,\n\n183\n00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:06.300\nthat's gonna shorten its ability or\nweaken its ability to cool the server.\n\n184\n00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.940\nSo, we need a vacuum and\n\n185\n00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.750\nthere's companies that make vacuums that\nare specifically designed for electronics.\n\n186\n00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.817\nNow, I've probably bought five of these\nover the years for different companies.\n\n187\n00:08:15.817 --> 00:08:17.645\nAnd it's always been the exact same one.\n\n188\n00:08:17.645 --> 00:08:19.225\nI never found a better alternative.\n\n189\n00:08:19.225 --> 00:08:22.360\nIt's from a company called Metrovac and\nlet me just kinda show you their webpage.\n\n190\n00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.080\nI don't get any kind of endorsement.\n\n191\n00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.670\nIf you know a better vacuum,\nplease tell me.\n\n192\n00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:29.150\nThis is literally the only one that\nI ever buy because it's the only that\n\n193\n00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.670\nI can really find.\n\n194\n00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:35.010\nBut these guys right here,\nthe DataVacs are ESD safe.\n\n195\n00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:39.520\nThey're designed so that they ground their\nelectrostatic discharge into the power\n\n196\n00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.010\nplug like they're supposed to and the\nmotor inside is not discharging any ESD\n\n197\n00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.730\ndown the hose and\ncausing problems with our components.\n\n198\n00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.090\nWith a consumer vacuum,\nyou don't know if that's the case.\n\n199\n00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.680\nSome of them might be,\nthey might be safe, but we don't know.\n\n200\n00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.700\nThese are specifically designed for it.\n\n201\n00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.410\nWhen you're dealing with\nvery expensive servers,\n\n202\n00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.420\nyou don't want to leave it to chance,\nright?\n\n203\n00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.700\nYou want to make sure you got to\nvacuum this design for it, so.\n\n204\n00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.224\nYou don't have to go with MetroVac,\n\n205\n00:09:02.224 --> 00:09:04.950\nI'm just saying that this\nis the example I used.\n\n206\n00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.060\nFind one out there that's ESD safe and\nmake sure you use that.\n\n207\n00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.580\nDo know that you should never vacuum\na server while it's turned on, right?\n\n208\n00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.590\nThe face plate is okay, and\nthe exit on the back is okay.\n\n209\n00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.611\nBut the internal components, you should\nnever vacuum while it's turned on,\n\n210\n00:09:19.611 --> 00:09:21.262\ngotta power the server off.\n\n211\n00:09:21.262 --> 00:09:23.930\nPower it off and\nthen vacuum the components out, right?\n\n212\n00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.140\nVacuum across the CPU,\nget all that dust out of there.\n\n213\n00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:31.281\nUsually what I do is schedule a routine\nface plate vacuuming where you can just\n\n214\n00:09:31.281 --> 00:09:34.607\nrun across the front and\nvacuum those out and do the backs too.\n\n215\n00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:39.040\nAnd then less often, maybe every six\nmonths or so, schedule some downtime for\n\n216\n00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.856\nthat server.\n\n217\n00:09:39.856 --> 00:09:41.425\nYou can actually clean out the interior.\n\n218\n00:09:41.425 --> 00:09:44.809\nIf you can keep your data center dust\nfree, you don't need to do any of that.\n\n219\n00:09:44.809 --> 00:09:47.995\nBut if you can't keep your data center\ndust free, it is building up, and\n\n220\n00:09:47.995 --> 00:09:49.990\nit is something that\nneeds to be maintained.\n\n221\n00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.238\nI would've shown you on this server but\nI actually vacuumed it out before the show\n\n222\n00:09:53.238 --> 00:09:55.596\nbecause I didn't want it to\nlook all terrible on the show.\n\n223\n00:09:55.596 --> 00:09:58.572\nIn hindsight, we should have\nfilmed these shows backwards and\n\n224\n00:09:58.572 --> 00:10:00.600\nthen I could have had it dusty and\nall that.\n\n225\n00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.720\nBut anyhow, so just be aware of\nthat as you vacuum them out.\n\n226\n00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.430\nNow, we've been talking about maintenance,\nand\n\n227\n00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.680\nthe way that we keep our servers healthy.\n\n228\n00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.180\nBut there is another option.\n\n229\n00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.715\nThere is another option besides\nmaintaining our servers like this.\n\n230\n00:10:13.715 --> 00:10:17.216\nWe could say look,\nno matter how much maintenance you do,\n\n231\n00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:19.151\nthere's going to be failures.\n\n232\n00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:20.370\nIt happens, right?\n\n233\n00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.400\nNo matter how much preventative\nmaintenance I do and how much I plan and\n\n234\n00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.660\nso on, there are going to be failures.\n\n235\n00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.750\nThat's the nature of the beast.\n\n236\n00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.950\nIf you use spinning hard drives,\nspinning hard drives fail, it's a fact.\n\n237\n00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.031\nIf you use SSD, SSD fails eventually.\n\n238\n00:10:34.031 --> 00:10:37.944\nRAM, CPU, anything that runs under heat,\ntemperature, it's gonna fail.\n\n239\n00:10:37.944 --> 00:10:39.615\nPower supplies, it's guaranteed.\n\n240\n00:10:39.615 --> 00:10:42.459\nIt doesn't matter what you do, it\ndoesn't matter how much money you spend,\n\n241\n00:10:42.459 --> 00:10:44.620\neventually you're going to have a failure.\n\n242\n00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.620\nSo with that in mind,\n\n243\n00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:53.230\nall this maintenance stuff kind of\nseems a little like you can't win.\n\n244\n00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.180\nIt's like reading an HP Lovecraft novel.\n\n245\n00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.460\nThis is the end, everybody dies.\n\n246\n00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.550\nThere's no point, right?\n\n247\n00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.950\nBut what we can do is,\nwe can say, all right,\n\n248\n00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.280\nwe're gonna do all the maintenance we can.\n\n249\n00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.610\nWe're gonna try and\nprevent every failure we can.\n\n250\n00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:09.100\nBut we're still gonna plan for\nwhat to do if there is a failure.\n\n251\n00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.250\nAnd the best way to secure yourself\nagainst a hardware failure\n\n252\n00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.020\nis to implement a cluster.\n\n253\n00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:19.180\nA cluster is where you don't\nhave one server do a job.\n\n254\n00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.090\nYou have two or three servers do that job.\n\n255\n00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.898\n4 or 5, 50, 100 servers do that job.\n\n256\n00:11:24.898 --> 00:11:26.020\nAnd that way,\n\n257\n00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:31.190\nwhen the inevitable failure does occur,\nother servers are just taking over.\n\n258\n00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.430\nAnd they're doing it and\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n259\n00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:34.890\nThat's how Facebook runs.\n\n260\n00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:35.820\nThat's how Twitter runs.\n\n261\n00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.960\nThis is how all these\nmassive organizations run.\n\n262\n00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.180\nEven even the ITProTV site,\nit's how our website runs.\n\n263\n00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.180\nSo that if we have one server fail,\nthere's other servers that are up and\n\n264\n00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.020\nrunning and doing the job already.\n\n265\n00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:47.669\nWe don't even notice.\n\n266\n00:11:47.669 --> 00:11:49.148\nIt just flips right\nover to the other ones.\n\n267\n00:11:49.148 --> 00:11:53.580\nAnd that way we can take the server\nthat's failed and go and deal with it.\n\n268\n00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.555\nBut even when there isn't a failure,\nmaybe I just wanna vacuum out the server.\n\n269\n00:11:57.555 --> 00:11:58.795\nSo I wanna power it down.\n\n270\n00:11:58.795 --> 00:12:01.750\nI wanna follow my proper\nshutdown procedures.\n\n271\n00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.812\nWe make sure we gracefully shut\ndown the operating systems so\n\n272\n00:12:04.812 --> 00:12:06.710\nwe don't get file corruption.\n\n273\n00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.970\nWe take it down and\nwe do maintenance on it.\n\n274\n00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.660\nWe update our firmware,\nwe vacuum out the boards,\n\n275\n00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:15.070\nwe test everything that we need to test\nthen we bring it back online, right?\n\n276\n00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.490\nWell, all that time it was offline,\nI need my people, my customers,\n\n277\n00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.610\nmy users to be able to access the system.\n\n278\n00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:25.610\nIf I have a cluster,\nanother node can step in and take over.\n\n279\n00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.130\nIt can take over that job and\nstart to perform it.\n\n280\n00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.290\nAnd clusters are kind of daunting.\n\n281\n00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:33.980\nIf you haven't worked in the server world\na lot, then people get intimidated by\n\n282\n00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.000\nthe idea of creating a cluster, but\nthey're actually really easy to work with.\n\n283\n00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.730\nThe only challenge with\na cluster is the storage piece.\n\n284\n00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.460\nIf I have a server that is, let's say\nit's a web server, all right, and\n\n285\n00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.610\nI wanna bring up five more web servers.\n\n286\n00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:48.950\nThat's really not a big deal.\n\n287\n00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:53.070\nYou can bring up five web servers and\nyou're done, right?\n\n288\n00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:57.670\nAnd you can use something like DNS load\nbalancing or round-robin to service that.\n\n289\n00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.519\nLet me show you an example, some of this\nis easier to see than to talk about.\n\n290\n00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:03.979\nSo for example, I've got this\nweb server right here, right?\n\n291\n00:13:03.979 --> 00:13:09.199\nSo this is just a web server,\nit's just running the default IIS webpage\n\n292\n00:13:09.199 --> 00:13:14.693\nright now so if I were to browse to its\nown IP, I get the default IIS webpage.\n\n293\n00:13:14.693 --> 00:13:16.171\nNothing special.\n\n294\n00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:22.221\nAnd I've got a second server right\nhere that also is a web server.\n\n295\n00:13:22.221 --> 00:13:27.305\nAnd it's up and it's running and\nif I browse to it, it will have,\n\n296\n00:13:27.305 --> 00:13:32.270\nwell [LAUGH] gotta trust\nitself which is always fun.\n\n297\n00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.630\nAnd maybe I'm lying,\nmaybe this isn't a web server.\n\n298\n00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.860\nNope, it isn't so\nI apparently need to get that set up.\n\n299\n00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.400\nBut if I want to bring this one up as\na second web server, so there you go.\n\n300\n00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.910\nSo I have two web servers,\n\n301\n00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.680\nhow do I tell people to visit the two\ndifferent web servers, right?\n\n302\n00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.740\nI want you to go and hit both of\nthese servers, not just one of them.\n\n303\n00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.000\nAnd that way if one goes down,\nthe other one can take over.\n\n304\n00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.875\nWell, you can use something as\nsimple as DNS round robining.\n\n305\n00:13:54.875 --> 00:13:57.430\nDNS round robining works on a simple idea.\n\n306\n00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:03.640\nIt says we can use the DNS records to\ncreate a load balanced environment.\n\n307\n00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.808\nSo when I take a look at my servers.\n\n308\n00:14:05.808 --> 00:14:08.282\nI've got LAB server 3 and LAB server 4.\n\n309\n00:14:08.282 --> 00:14:10.529\nThose are the two web servers\nthat I was just talking about.\n\n310\n00:14:10.529 --> 00:14:12.293\nLAB server 3 was running a web server,\n\n311\n00:14:12.293 --> 00:14:14.498\napparently LAB server 4\nI forgot to install it.\n\n312\n00:14:14.498 --> 00:14:17.516\nSo if I wanna load balance\ntraffic across those,\n\n313\n00:14:17.516 --> 00:14:21.945\nI probably have a record in here\nalready of something like www, right?\n\n314\n00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:25.755\nI want people to go to www.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n315\n00:14:25.755 --> 00:14:31.400\nAnd when they go, I want them to\ngo to LAB-SERVER 3, all right?\n\n316\n00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:36.391\nSo I'm gonna come in here and create that\nentry, and I'm gonna add that host and\n\n317\n00:14:36.391 --> 00:14:38.450\nthere we go, all right?\n\n318\n00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:42.560\nNow whenever somebody\nbrowses to www.lab.itprotv\n\n319\n00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.221\nthey're gonna get LAB server 3.\n\n320\n00:14:45.221 --> 00:14:51.306\nBut if I take LAB server 3 offline,\nwebsite's down, right?\n\n321\n00:14:51.306 --> 00:14:56.414\nBut, if I add a second entry, so, I'm\ngonna come in here and add another entry.\n\n322\n00:14:56.414 --> 00:15:03.075\nAnd I'm gonna say www points to\n10.0222.104 that's LAB server 4.\n\n323\n00:15:03.075 --> 00:15:05.650\nAnd I'll add that host, okay?\n\n324\n00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.206\nSo, there it goes, it's added.\n\n325\n00:15:07.206 --> 00:15:11.168\nNow, when I look, I've got two entries,\n\n326\n00:15:11.168 --> 00:15:16.795\nwww is pointed to 10.0.222.103, and 104.\n\n327\n00:15:16.795 --> 00:15:19.098\nIt's pointed to both.\n\n328\n00:15:19.098 --> 00:15:20.474\nWhat does that mean?\n\n329\n00:15:20.474 --> 00:15:22.456\nWell DNS does round robining.\n\n330\n00:15:22.456 --> 00:15:29.569\nSo when people connect, what they're gonna\ndo is they're gonna do a look up for\n\n331\n00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:34.251\nwww.lab.itpro.tv and\nthey're gonna get an IP.\n\n332\n00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:38.480\nNormally you get one IP,\nbut I'm getting two IPs.\n\n333\n00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.435\nI get 103 and 104.\n\n334\n00:15:41.435 --> 00:15:42.723\nI'm gonna connect to 103.\n\n335\n00:15:42.723 --> 00:15:45.056\nWell, watch what happens\nwhen I do the lookup again.\n\n336\n00:15:45.056 --> 00:15:47.904\nThis time, I get 104 and 103.\n\n337\n00:15:47.904 --> 00:15:49.583\nSee how they're backwards?\n\n338\n00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:52.615\nIt's cycling it, over and\nover and over again.\n\n339\n00:15:52.615 --> 00:15:56.042\nIf I had five servers or ten servers,\nit would cycle through all five or\n\n340\n00:15:56.042 --> 00:15:59.641\nall ten And that way, the first person\nwho comes to the site goes to one IP,\n\n341\n00:15:59.641 --> 00:16:02.040\nthe second person goes to a second IP.\n\n342\n00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.390\nI'm load balancing across these two nodes.\n\n343\n00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:08.560\nIf I take one offline 50% of the people\n\n344\n00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.106\nare gonna go to the other server and\nbe happy.\n\n345\n00:16:10.106 --> 00:16:14.110\nThe other 50% are gonna go to\nthe first server that's offline, and\n\n346\n00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.780\nit's gonna fail and then they'll switch\nto the other IP and go to the other one.\n\n347\n00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.330\nSo, 50% of the people will be happy.\n\n348\n00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.270\nThe other 50% will just be a little\nbit slower, a little less happy.\n\n349\n00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.500\nBut, they'll get to the site anyway,\nright?\n\n350\n00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.858\nWell, that's actually\nthe flaw in round robining.\n\n351\n00:16:28.858 --> 00:16:32.890\nWith round-robining, it doesn't have\na great way to see that the node is down.\n\n352\n00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:36.010\nIt still sends people to the node,\neven though it's down, right?\n\n353\n00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:41.290\nSo, instead of round-robining, with\nclusters we use what's used heart beating.\n\n354\n00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.120\nHeart beating is where the server\nsends heart beats to each other,\n\n355\n00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.380\nand tell each other that they're online.\n\n356\n00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.208\nHey, I'm online, how about you?\n\n357\n00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:50.028\nAnd the other server says,\nyep I'm online too.\n\n358\n00:16:50.028 --> 00:16:54.278\nAnd they talk back and forth and\nwhen one node goes offline,\n\n359\n00:16:54.278 --> 00:16:58.930\nthe other node takes control and\nsays I'm running the show now.\n\n360\n00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:03.943\nEverybody comes to me, and your ad users\nonly go to the person who's online.\n\n361\n00:17:03.943 --> 00:17:05.400\nWell, I should clarify that.\n\n362\n00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.280\nWhen we build a cluster, let just say we\nhave two nodes, two nodes in the cluster.\n\n363\n00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.720\nWe can do an active,\nactive or an active passive.\n\n364\n00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:18.006\nAn active passive is the most common,\nthe three of one active server, and\n\n365\n00:17:18.006 --> 00:17:20.026\nthen the other server is passive.\n\n366\n00:17:20.026 --> 00:17:21.310\nIt's just sitting there waiting.\n\n367\n00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.380\nIt's waiting for the active over the fail.\n\n368\n00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.780\nIt's watching that heartbeat.\n\n369\n00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.812\nAnd it said, ho, ho, ho, I can't wait.\n\n370\n00:17:26.812 --> 00:17:29.324\nIf I don't see a heartbeat I'm\njumping in and taking over.\n\n371\n00:17:29.324 --> 00:17:32.878\nAnd that's why happens the moment\nthe active server stops giving a heartbeat\n\n372\n00:17:32.878 --> 00:17:36.190\nas a failure, the passive\nserver steps in and takes over.\n\n373\n00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.220\nSame IP address, same configuration.\n\n374\n00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.610\nIt jumps on your end users don't\nnotice the difference, and\n\n375\n00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.220\nthey keep working right.\n\n376\n00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.060\nThat's an active passive.\n\n377\n00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.720\nNow, the problem that active passive is\nthat second server was sitting there doing\n\n378\n00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.010\nnothing the whole time.\n\n379\n00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.620\nI paid for that server,\nit's not doing anything.\n\n380\n00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.690\nSo, sometimes we can set up\nwhat's called an active, active.\n\n381\n00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:56.540\nWhere both nodes are active,\nthey're both up and running and\n\n382\n00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.280\nI'm load balancing across the two.\n\n383\n00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.371\nThey're sharing an IP Address.\n\n384\n00:18:00.371 --> 00:18:02.970\nThey're both using the same\nIP at the same time.\n\n385\n00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.640\nWell the software has to support that.\n\n386\n00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.260\nSo, like Microsoft IAS supports that,\nsome systems don't, right.\n\n387\n00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:13.700\nAnd if they do, when one node goes\noffline, it just stops getting traffic,\n\n388\n00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.530\nand all the traffic goes to\nthe node that's still online.\n\n389\n00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:18.810\nThat way we keep our systems up.\n\n390\n00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:21.430\nNobody notices the difference and\n\n391\n00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:24.400\nwe could handle failures as\nwell as maintenance windows.\n\n392\n00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.350\nIf I have a five-server cluster and\nI take one server offline for maintenance,\n\n393\n00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.340\nnobody will notice.\n\n394\n00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.880\nI can do all my maintenance, bring it back\nonline, and I can move to the next server.\n\n395\n00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.770\nAnd you can do what's called\nthe rolling maintenance,\n\n396\n00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.300\nwhere you're doing maintenance\non one server at a time,\n\n397\n00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.020\nmoving through each of the servers.\n\n398\n00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.520\nNobody is none the wiser, right?\n\n399\n00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.950\nSo, it really works out\npretty well to do that.\n\n400\n00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:48.520\nRound-robining is okay, but\nhaving an actual cluster is better, right?\n\n401\n00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.820\nThe thing about a cluster is that in order\nto have two servers doing the same job, so\n\n402\n00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.220\nI have two web servers, right?\n\n403\n00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.800\nOne, I keep saying that, I have one\nweb server and one server that for\n\n404\n00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:57.880\nwhatever reason isn't a web server.\n\n405\n00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.065\nSo, I'm gonna add that web server real,\nreal quick.\n\n406\n00:19:00.065 --> 00:19:04.490\nBu,t if I have a web server one\nof the things they're gonna need\n\n407\n00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:05.940\nis a web page, right?\n\n408\n00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.590\nI've gotta serve up web page.\n\n409\n00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:12.450\nWell, if I have one web server I just\ngo and put the web page on there,\n\n410\n00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:13.790\nand that's that, right?\n\n411\n00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:14.550\nNot a big deal.\n\n412\n00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.870\nWell, I am a web server, darn it.\n\n413\n00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.670\nI must have typed the loop\nback address in wrong.\n\n414\n00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.020\nApparently, I don't know how to type.\n\n415\n00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.696\nAlthough I do have a service\npair on here to, so who knows.\n\n416\n00:19:23.696 --> 00:19:27.130\nBut, when I gonna configure\nthe server if it is a webpage, and\n\n417\n00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:28.640\nI decide to change the webpage.\n\n418\n00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.860\nI'm gonna go update it on\neach of those nodes, right.\n\n419\n00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:37.180\nIf I have a 10 node cluster, so\n10 servers, anytime I change the web page.\n\n420\n00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:41.590\nI'm gonna on update that on 10 servers,\nand that's a pain.\n\n421\n00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:45.010\nAnd now its working, so that's a pain.\n\n422\n00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:48.880\nSo, with a cluster what you\nreally need is shared storage.\n\n423\n00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.520\nWith shared storage you have a set of hard\ndrives that are usually located on a san,\n\n424\n00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.270\nand all ten servers can\nsee the same hard drives.\n\n425\n00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.390\nAnd they can see those hard drives,\nand none of them synchronize.\n\n426\n00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.480\nIf one server fails another\none can take over, and\n\n427\n00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:05.880\nthey all see the same storage,\nthey're just ready to go, right?\n\n428\n00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.710\nOn a positive side, we can instantly\nfail over we don't have to sync things.\n\n429\n00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.320\nOn the negative side,\n\n430\n00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.530\nwhat happens if two systems try to write\nto the same drive at the same time?\n\n431\n00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.870\nYou get data corruption.\n\n432\n00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.630\nSo, you can't have that happen.\n\n433\n00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.660\nA cluster that can fit into a shared\nstorage will make sure that only one host\n\n434\n00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.450\nis allowed to touch the storage at a time.\n\n435\n00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:28.710\nAnd that means active-passive,\nnot active-active.\n\n436\n00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:30.177\nIf you know active-active,\n\n437\n00:20:30.177 --> 00:20:33.530\nyou can't have two people riding to\nthe same thing at the same time.\n\n438\n00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:34.870\nAnd it causes a problem.\n\n439\n00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:36.870\nSo, you need some kind of gatekeeper and\n\n440\n00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.630\nthere is cluster software that can\nacts as gatekeepers separated out.\n\n441\n00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.730\nSo, again more than one active-active or\nwhatever.\n\n442\n00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:45.211\nBut, instead on a web server I like to\nsee something simple like our sink or\n\n443\n00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:46.909\nsome kinda file synchronization.\n\n444\n00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:51.603\nSo that put a web page on server one and\nthen replicate the server two through ten,\n\n445\n00:20:51.603 --> 00:20:55.830\nand then I will let you got the same page\nbut I need to put that in the place.\n\n446\n00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:58.920\nThe cluster itself doesn't\nsynchronize data for me.\n\n447\n00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.700\nThe cluster itself, it just manages\nwho's active and who's not.\n\n448\n00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.980\nSo, if I have two web servers here,\n\n449\n00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.350\nI can bring them up into\na cluster pretty easily.\n\n450\n00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.518\nSo, I'll take one of my nodes here,\nI'll take labserv03.\n\n451\n00:21:11.518 --> 00:21:16.310\nAnd on labserv03,\nI'm gonna use the Windows\n\n452\n00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:22.010\nfail over cluster manager which I gonna\nlaunch, and I'll just build a cluster.\n\n453\n00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:25.170\nNow, if you're running Linux there's\ndifferent types of clusters you can\n\n454\n00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.130\nbuild in there.\n\n455\n00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.830\nAnd a lot of people aren't\nclustering the same way under Linux,\n\n456\n00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.210\nbecause you can usually just use\na load cluster it keep the same goal.\n\n457\n00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.970\nBut, on the Windows environment, the\ncluster is really the best way to handle\n\n458\n00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:38.920\nit, because we need that gatekeeper\ncontrolling access to the storage.\n\n459\n00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.390\nSo, I'm gonna come in here, and\nI'm gonna create a cluster.\n\n460\n00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:45.740\nWhen I do that, I mentioned hardware\nvalidation in another episode,\n\n461\n00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.830\nMicrosoft wants to make sure\nthat my hardware is compatible.\n\n462\n00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:52.840\nIf my hardware is not compatible,\nthey're not gonna provide me support.\n\n463\n00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.510\nIt will still let me build the cluster.\n\n464\n00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:58.360\nSo, you're gonna see me skip some of that\nvalidation stuff as I go through, but\n\n465\n00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:03.171\nI'm gonna start here with labserv03,\n\n466\n00:22:03.171 --> 00:22:07.810\nget that one added, that's gonna be the\nserver we're adding into the cluster, and\n\n467\n00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:12.830\nanybody else that I want to add in,\nI'm gonna also add labserv04 is\n\n468\n00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:18.210\nthe other server that's gonna be\nin this cluster, and there we go.\n\n469\n00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.650\nIf I had more, I could add them in.\n\n470\n00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:23.619\nI think Microsoft, if I remember we\nmaxed out at 16, it's either 16 or\n\n471\n00:22:23.619 --> 00:22:25.250\n32 nodes in a cluster.\n\n472\n00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.650\nIn Linux environments you can do Beowulf\nclusters that have 100 of nodes, so\n\n473\n00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.430\nyou can sometimes go considerably higher.\n\n474\n00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.063\nAlright, here's my validation warning\nit's gonna ask whether I wanna validate\n\n475\n00:22:35.063 --> 00:22:35.591\nmy hardware.\n\n476\n00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:38.110\nFor the sake of the show\nI'm gonna choose no, but\n\n477\n00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:41.996\nin real life plan I would never do\nan invalidating cluster and production.\n\n478\n00:22:41.996 --> 00:22:45.151\nYou wanna make sure you can\nget support if you need it.\n\n479\n00:22:45.151 --> 00:22:48.131\nAll right, I need to get a better\ncluster name, I'm gonna call mine www,\n\n480\n00:22:48.131 --> 00:22:50.220\ncuz this is gonna be my web server.\n\n481\n00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:54.440\nAnd it's going to need\na shared IP address,\n\n482\n00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.910\nbecause in a cluster, each server needs\nto be able to take over for the others.\n\n483\n00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:02.530\nSo, they have a virtual IP that\nthey share across all the nodes.\n\n484\n00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:07.663\nSo, I'm gonna assign this one let's see,\n10.0.222.105,\n\n485\n00:23:07.663 --> 00:23:13.126\nthat's what I'll give it, and that's\ngonna be the shared IP for this system.\n\n486\n00:23:15.197 --> 00:23:18.470\nAnd, it's seeing my\nrecord already created.\n\n487\n00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:24.863\nI'll just call it web, or we'll call it\nWeb cluster how about that, all right?\n\n488\n00:23:24.863 --> 00:23:25.470\nThere we go,\n\n489\n00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.020\nif I hadn't created that DNS record\nahead of time that would have been fine.\n\n490\n00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:32.068\nIt was duplicated, and so\nit was telling me I couldn't do that so.\n\n491\n00:23:32.068 --> 00:23:36.010\nAll right, now it does have the option to\nadd all eligible storage in the cluster.\n\n492\n00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.090\nWhat does that mean?\n\n493\n00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:40.050\nWell, if I had shared storage\nif I'm plugged in to a stand.\n\n494\n00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.960\nIt would recognize that and\nbring it into the cluster.\n\n495\n00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.870\nNow, I don't have a SAN\njust laying around to use.\n\n496\n00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.800\nSo instead, I brought up an iSCSI SAN, and\n\n497\n00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.770\nI do have some shared\nstorage that's sitting there.\n\n498\n00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:50.100\nSo, it should recognize that and bring it.\n\n499\n00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.240\nIf it doesn't,\nI can always add it in myself.\n\n500\n00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.820\nBut it's going to build the cluster.\n\n501\n00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.605\nAnd what it's doing is it's\ntalking to the two servers.\n\n502\n00:23:56.605 --> 00:24:01.225\nIt's talking to lab server three and lab\nserver four And it's getting them to start\n\n503\n00:24:01.225 --> 00:24:06.150\nthe failover cluster service, and\nto start sending heartbeats to each other.\n\n504\n00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:07.710\nThey're sending heartbeats\nto each other so\n\n505\n00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:11.140\nthey know whether they're healthy or not.\n\n506\n00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.230\nAnd if one is not healthy and\ngoes offline,\n\n507\n00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:17.265\nthe other one will be able to take\nover and run the shell, okay.\n\n508\n00:24:17.265 --> 00:24:21.425\nWhen it's done, I should have a cluster,\nI need to wait a moment for\n\n509\n00:24:21.425 --> 00:24:23.745\nit to do it's little refresh,\nit'll just take a second.\n\n510\n00:24:23.745 --> 00:24:27.855\nBut if I come down here under nodes,\nI can take a look at my two systems.\n\n511\n00:24:27.855 --> 00:24:32.645\nAnd I've got LAB-SERV03 and\nLAB-SERV04, they're both up, okay.\n\n512\n00:24:32.645 --> 00:24:37.070\nNow notice over here whether they're\nAssigned a Vote, what the heck is that?\n\n513\n00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:42.130\nWell, let's say I have two nodes,\nand for some\n\n514\n00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:46.110\nreason I'm sending a heartbeat but the\nother node isn't getting the heartbeat.\n\n515\n00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.727\nI'm active, I'm sending a heartbeat but\nthe other side's not getting it,\n\n516\n00:24:48.727 --> 00:24:50.552\nmaybe there's a network\nfailure in between the two.\n\n517\n00:24:50.552 --> 00:24:54.944\nWell, I might know that I'm up, and\nthe other side looks and says, no,\n\n518\n00:24:54.944 --> 00:24:58.630\nthe other guy must be down and\nso, it tries to go active.\n\n519\n00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:04.250\nI'm already active and it goes active too\nand now we're right to the same storage.\n\n520\n00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:07.420\nOkay, that's bad,\nthat would cause a problem.\n\n521\n00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.880\nSo, you never want an environment\nwhere you could have a tie.\n\n522\n00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.450\nA tie or an inconclusive vote,\n\n523\n00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:15.910\nwhere you have two different sides\nthat both think they're right.\n\n524\n00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.280\nSo in a cluster, you normally\nleverage what's called a quorum.\n\n525\n00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.290\nIf you have an odd number of\ncluster hosts, you don't need it.\n\n526\n00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:24.670\nBut if you have an even\nnumber of cluster hosts,\n\n527\n00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:28.918\nyou need a tiebreaker, somebody who\ncan act as that differentiator.\n\n528\n00:25:28.918 --> 00:25:31.610\nAnd the tiebreaker is usually\ncalled a quorum host, and\n\n529\n00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:36.590\nit might be a extra cluster node\nthat just serves that role.\n\n530\n00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:40.180\nOr it could be a file server on your\nnetwork, it could be any number of things.\n\n531\n00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.680\nBut it's just another\nserver somebody out there\n\n532\n00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.970\nwho can pass judgement as to whether or\nnot you actually have a failure.\n\n533\n00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.538\nAnd so, in my system,\nI don't have a quorum so\n\n534\n00:25:49.538 --> 00:25:53.740\nit's kinda showing me my vote status\nhere and it's not quite setup right, so\n\n535\n00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.590\nI would need to go in and adjust that.\n\n536\n00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.460\nAnd when you pull up your cluster\nservices, you'll actually have\n\n537\n00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:03.220\nthat option to customize it and\nchange it and set how you want that to be.\n\n538\n00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.660\nI've got some errors in the background.\n\n539\n00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.350\nOne error is gonna be validation,\n\n540\n00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:08.640\nthe other error is gonna be\nthe quorum configuration.\n\n541\n00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.030\nSo, I'll have to be careful as I configure\nall of this to make sure that I get\n\n542\n00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:15.980\nthat set the way that I need it\nto be to get it all working.\n\n543\n00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.810\nBut once it's up and\n\n544\n00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:21.300\ngoing the cluster configuration\nitself is pretty straightforward.\n\n545\n00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.990\nEverybody's able to participate and\ntalk and serve up a role.\n\n546\n00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:27.210\nWell, I need to add the role to it.\n\n547\n00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:31.588\nI have a cluster now Server 3 and\nserver 4 are clustered together and\n\n548\n00:26:31.588 --> 00:26:35.756\nthey're sharing the IP\naddress of 10.0.222.105.\n\n549\n00:26:35.756 --> 00:26:38.000\nBut they're not doing anything with it.\n\n550\n00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.180\nI need to come up to their roles and\ntell it what I want to cluster.\n\n551\n00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.780\nI wanna cluster a web server.\n\n552\n00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:47.950\nSo, I'm gonna configure a role and\nin my High Availability Wizard,\n\n553\n00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:50.410\nI'm gonna tell it what it\nis exactly that I want.\n\n554\n00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:53.470\nAnd so, in here, I'll be able come in and\nfigure out what I want.\n\n555\n00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:58.650\nIf I wanted to be a web server, if I\nwanted to be a Virtual Machine like that,\n\n556\n00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.380\nif I wanna do a Generic Service.\n\n557\n00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.540\nMaybe it’s a service that\nMicrosoft does know about.\n\n558\n00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.980\nBut a third party vendor made this\nservice and they made it cluster aware so\n\n559\n00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.360\nit's ready to be served up.\n\n560\n00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.573\nSo I can come in and I can punch that in.\n\n561\n00:27:10.573 --> 00:27:16.643\nYou'll see distributed File Server, DHCP,\nGeneric Application, Generic Script,\n\n562\n00:27:16.643 --> 00:27:22.066\nall sorts of different things that we\ncould specify in here for it, all right.\n\n563\n00:27:22.066 --> 00:27:25.238\nI'll just do Generic Service to\nkinda show you the process and\n\n564\n00:27:25.238 --> 00:27:27.987\nit's gonna ask me what\nservice it is that I'm doing.\n\n565\n00:27:27.987 --> 00:27:31.918\nAnd I guess if I stick with\nweb services I can do,\n\n566\n00:27:31.918 --> 00:27:37.551\nwhat's it called Windows Internet\nsomething or another [LAUGH].\n\n567\n00:27:37.551 --> 00:27:40.751\nThere World Wide Web Publishing Service\nwe'll do that one, all right.\n\n568\n00:27:40.751 --> 00:27:44.187\nAnd I'm gonna tell this is\ngoing to be my website.\n\n569\n00:27:44.187 --> 00:27:49.881\nNormally, I would use one of the pre-built\ncluster options from earlier but in this\n\n570\n00:27:49.881 --> 00:27:55.430\ncase, we'll call that and it is not happy\nwith the name I have chosen apparently.\n\n571\n00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:59.870\nIt's making me pick a new IP for\nit, that's fine, so\n\n572\n00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:01.840\nwe'll give it 106 this time.\n\n573\n00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.870\nThe other IP, it's using for\nthe cluster and so\n\n574\n00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:08.770\nonce a dedicated IP just for\nthis service, so I'll just provide that.\n\n575\n00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:12.260\nAnd then whether or not I need Shared\nStorage, that's gonna be my next option.\n\n576\n00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.450\nI may not need Shared Storage.\n\n577\n00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:16.000\nIf I'm synchronizing the website\nthrough some other means,\n\n578\n00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.380\nthen I don't need a SAN or\niSCSI or anything like that.\n\n579\n00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.790\nBut if I need Shared Storage,\nI can add it here.\n\n580\n00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.540\nNow, it's looks like my\nstorage wasn't detected.\n\n581\n00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:26.990\nSo, I'll need to add that in manually,\nwhich is probably why I didn't see my\n\n582\n00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:29.660\nquorum option earlier also,\ncuz your storage is quorum.\n\n583\n00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:34.038\nAnd then if I'm Replicating Registry\nSettings, I can specify those and\n\n584\n00:28:34.038 --> 00:28:35.670\nthen I confirm my configurations.\n\n585\n00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.101\nSo, we'll go ahead and finish that up.\n\n586\n00:28:37.101 --> 00:28:39.140\nAnd it's gonna get that setup.\n\n587\n00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.640\nNow, I'm actually serving something up\n\n588\n00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.220\nas part of the cluster that reaching\nup to the other side and communicating.\n\n589\n00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.570\nIf the software is not cluster-aware,\nthis is not gonna work.\n\n590\n00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.420\nThe software has to be cluster-aware for\nthis to work and for\n\n591\n00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.600\nthey came up and be healthy.\n\n592\n00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.880\nSame thing with Storage, your Storage\nhas to be designed to work in a cluster.\n\n593\n00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.280\nIt can't be locally attached storage.\n\n594\n00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:04.262\nIt's gotta be Shared Storage like on\na Fibre Channel SAN, an iSCSI SAN,\n\n595\n00:29:04.262 --> 00:29:07.345\nsomething in that nature in order for\nit to show up here.\n\n596\n00:29:07.345 --> 00:29:10.829\nIf I come in and try to add my disk\nthey're showing is not being available\n\n597\n00:29:10.829 --> 00:29:15.450\nprobably cuz they're not initialized yet\nso let me go into my Computer Management.\n\n598\n00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.270\nAnd I'll initialize\nthose disks real quick.\n\n599\n00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:18.630\nNow here's where things are kinda neat,\n\n600\n00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:23.720\nbecause if I go into my Disk Management\non this server, here's my shared storage.\n\n601\n00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.337\nI've got a 2 GB disk and a 250 GB disk.\n\n602\n00:29:27.337 --> 00:29:30.440\nThese are all my iSCSI SAN and\nthey're showing up right here.\n\n603\n00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.340\nThis server sees them, this is LAB-SERV03.\n\n604\n00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:38.980\nIf I go over to LAB-SERV04 and\nI pull up its Computer Management and\n\n605\n00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:43.170\ngo into its Disk Management,\nit will see those same disks.\n\n606\n00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.520\nThere they are, a 2 GB and a 250 GB.\n\n607\n00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:51.150\nThose are the exact same disks, not\njust copies, it's the exact same disks.\n\n608\n00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:53.210\nIf they both try to write\nto those disks at the same,\n\n609\n00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:54.900\nthat's gonna cause some problems,\nisn't it?\n\n610\n00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.750\nBut the cluster is what's\ngonna save us from that.\n\n611\n00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:02.010\nSo when I go back to LAB-SERV03 and\nI initialize this disk.\n\n612\n00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:04.851\nI'm gonna bring them online, so\n\n613\n00:30:04.851 --> 00:30:09.730\nI'm gonna bring them online and\nI will initialize them.\n\n614\n00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:14.429\nAll right, so there they go so\nnow they're on and initialized, right?\n\n615\n00:30:14.429 --> 00:30:18.910\nWhen I go look over here,\nthey still show as an Unknown state.\n\n616\n00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:20.910\nAnd they still show as offline.\n\n617\n00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:24.360\nWindows is trying to protect us saying,\nI don't wanna bring these online yet\n\n618\n00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.660\nbecause, I don't know exactly\nwhat these are being used for and\n\n619\n00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:29.900\nsomebody else might be touching them,\nso I'm just gonna leave them be.\n\n620\n00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:34.980\nBut over here, now we should be\nable to come into our disks and\n\n621\n00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:38.440\nadd them in and they show up,\nthere they are.\n\n622\n00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.460\nAnd I can add them to the cluster.\n\n623\n00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:45.160\nNow when I do that, what's gonna happen\nis these disks are online right here.\n\n624\n00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.090\nThey show as online,\n\n625\n00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:50.760\nthey show as available and\nthe Owner Node is LAB-SERV03, right?\n\n626\n00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.820\nSo, we own them, okay?\n\n627\n00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.070\nBut the owner doesn't have to be me.\n\n628\n00:30:56.070 --> 00:31:00.758\nI can move them over to one of the other\nsystems and you'll see we can do things\n\n629\n00:31:00.758 --> 00:31:05.683\nlike Turn On Maintenance Mode which means\nstop people from accessing the disk.\n\n630\n00:31:05.683 --> 00:31:08.809\nOr I can add them to\nCluster Shared Volumes and\n\n631\n00:31:08.809 --> 00:31:14.576\nthat's where we're gonna open it up so\nthat multiple people can access that disk.\n\n632\n00:31:14.576 --> 00:31:19.072\nAnd once that's done,\nit actually kinda shifts it around a bit,\n\n633\n00:31:19.072 --> 00:31:22.610\nI think I have to wait just a moment for\nit to happen.\n\n634\n00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:25.978\nSomebody's option yet to wait cuz\nit's gonna talk to the other node.\n\n635\n00:31:25.978 --> 00:31:29.554\nThe other node has to make the same\nchange that we're making and\n\n636\n00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:31.049\nthen kinda bring it back.\n\n637\n00:31:31.049 --> 00:31:38.872\nSo, I may need to refresh my screen here\nbefore that'll take effect and or not.\n\n638\n00:31:38.872 --> 00:31:44.733\nLet's just do it, one more moment here,\nbefore I start messing with it too much.\n\n639\n00:31:44.733 --> 00:31:49.431\nAll right, so once that's done,\nnow, the storage is available and\n\n640\n00:31:49.431 --> 00:31:54.291\nI can have cluster roles that are storing\ndata there and the other node,\n\n641\n00:31:54.291 --> 00:31:57.288\nlike this guy,\nwill be able to see the disk.\n\n642\n00:31:57.288 --> 00:31:59.759\nAnd see how it doesn't\nshow as unknown anymore?\n\n643\n00:31:59.759 --> 00:32:03.269\nOn LAB-SERV04, the not unknown,\nthey're reserved, right?\n\n644\n00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:06.500\nThis disk is offline because of\na policy set by an administrator.\n\n645\n00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.970\nEarlier they were unknown,\n\n646\n00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:11.770\nnow they're reserved because this server\ncould take over that node if it needed to.\n\n647\n00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:17.650\nBut its not doing it because\nthe cluster has it, not us, right?\n\n648\n00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:20.350\nAnd the cluster right now is\nsaying that server03 gets it.\n\n649\n00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:23.542\nBut if server03 fails,\nserver04 can take it, it can grab and\n\n650\n00:32:23.542 --> 00:32:25.840\nthese will go from reserved to online.\n\n651\n00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.940\nAnd then we'll start to access and\nuse that information.\n\n652\n00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:36.248\nSo if we take that storage and assign it\nto a role and I assign it to my website.\n\n653\n00:32:36.248 --> 00:32:39.020\nSo I'm gonna attach that role, so\ninstead of being available storage,\n\n654\n00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.240\nit's now attached to the website.\n\n655\n00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:44.592\nServer03 is able to host the website,\nserver04 is able to host the website,\n\n656\n00:32:44.592 --> 00:32:47.347\nthey both now have a reason\nto access that storage.\n\n657\n00:32:47.347 --> 00:32:50.720\nNow I never did format that storage, so I\nguess that's probably a step I should do.\n\n658\n00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:55.428\nSo I'm just going to throw a quick, I'm\njust going to accept all the defaults and\n\n659\n00:32:55.428 --> 00:32:56.896\nformat that real quick.\n\n660\n00:32:56.896 --> 00:32:58.780\nAnd there we go.\n\n661\n00:32:58.780 --> 00:32:59.440\nAll right.\n\n662\n00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.350\nSo that's gonna get formatted.\n\n663\n00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:03.240\nIn just a moment,\nit'll show up with a drive letter and\n\n664\n00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.370\nit will be accessible just\nlike any other storage.\n\n665\n00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:09.680\nNow, it's a cluster shared\nvolume not a regular volume.\n\n666\n00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.910\nSo it's not gonna get a drive letter.\n\n667\n00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:12.790\nIt's gonna get mounted to\na folder on the hard drive.\n\n668\n00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:17.140\nWhich if I look at my C drive,\nthere's this cluster storage folder and\n\n669\n00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.290\nthat's where it's gonna end\nup as soon as it's ready.\n\n670\n00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:21.980\nBut again, it's taking a moment\nbecause it's gotta communicate to\n\n671\n00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.420\nthe two different cluster nodes and\nexchange that information.\n\n672\n00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:31.780\nAnd once it's done, now both servers will\nbe able to access that information and\n\n673\n00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:35.610\none can take over if\nthe other goes offline.\n\n674\n00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:36.880\nWe'll got the big shared and\n\n675\n00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:41.470\nI don't want two nodes writing in\nthe same data at the same time.\n\n676\n00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:43.510\nThe cluster is separating that, all right?\n\n677\n00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:45.760\nSo clusters are not hard to set up.\n\n678\n00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.540\nIf you go for a full blown SAN,\nthe SAN is the hard part to setup.\n\n679\n00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.840\nBut once that's done,\nsetting up the cluster is easy.\n\n680\n00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.790\nAnd now the servers are up and running.\n\n681\n00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:57.080\nAnd they're running under a single IP, so\nthe last step I would need to do is go and\n\n682\n00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.565\nupdate DNS.\n\n683\n00:33:58.565 --> 00:34:02.435\nBack here in DNS, oops,\nif I get log back in.\n\n684\n00:34:02.435 --> 00:34:07.761\nEarlier what I did is I said I have\none name that mapped to two IPs.\n\n685\n00:34:07.761 --> 00:34:12.231\nWell, now what I can do is I can\ncome in here and I can change that.\n\n686\n00:34:12.231 --> 00:34:19.230\nAnd instead of having one name to two IPs,\nI can have one name going to one IP.\n\n687\n00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:25.010\nI can change that to the 106 IP that\nI assigned to the web server and\n\n688\n00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:27.740\nthat's pointing to the cluster.\n\n689\n00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:32.400\nAnd that'll go to lab-serv03 if\nthat someone that's online or\n\n690\n00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.070\nif it goes offline, it'll go to\nlab-serv04 cuz it'll take over that IP.\n\n691\n00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:37.770\nThat's the way the clusters work.\n\n692\n00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:40.750\nSo now I can have a hardware failure or\n\n693\n00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:44.230\nI can have maintenance windows\nwithout taking the web server offline.\n\n694\n00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:46.010\nAnd everything stays up and happy.\n\n695\n00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:48.020\nThat's the advantage of having a cluster.\n\n696\n00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.700\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\na lot of great information there.\n\n697\n00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.360\nIt does look like we're coming to an end\nof another episode, but before we do,\n\n698\n00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.270\ndo you have parting words?\n\n699\n00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:57.660\n&gt;&gt; I don't wanna make it seem\nlike clusters are super simple.\n\n700\n00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.500\nI do try to make it sound\nlike it's not intimidating.\n\n701\n00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.280\nBut make sure you read\nyour instruction manuals.\n\n702\n00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.030\nIf you set up a cluster,\nif you're doing it in Linux or Windows.\n\n703\n00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:09.125\nOS 10 doesn't actually have any\nsupportive clustering technologies, so\n\n704\n00:35:09.125 --> 00:35:10.980\nit usually be in Linux or Windows.\n\n705\n00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.818\nAnd if you're doing a cluster like that,\n\n706\n00:35:12.818 --> 00:35:15.610\nmake sure you're following\nthe recommended steps.\n\n707\n00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:18.150\nEvery vendor has the guides,\nRed Hat, Canonical.\n\n708\n00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.960\nThey've got guides for it.\n\n709\n00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.420\nMake sure you follow the steps.\n\n710\n00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.380\nAnd the other thing is recognize that\nsometimes cluster aren't needed.\n\n711\n00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.910\nSometimes you can use\na hardware load balancer and\n\n712\n00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:27.858\nit serves the whole role\nof having a cluster.\n\n713\n00:35:27.858 --> 00:35:29.540\nYou don't have to sell all\nthis stuff at the back end.\n\n714\n00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:33.135\nSo just make sure that you follow\n\n715\n00:35:33.135 --> 00:35:36.135\nthe proper steps that you're really able\nto get support if something goes wrong.\n\n716\n00:35:36.135 --> 00:35:37.645\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, great information.\n\n717\n00:35:37.645 --> 00:35:39.345\nThank you for\njoining us here in the studios.\n\n718\n00:35:39.345 --> 00:35:41.625\nAnd we do appreciate you,\nthe viewer

--> 00:00:12.430\nwatching ITProTV\n&gt;&gt; Hello and\n\n4\n00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.600\nwelcome to another great\nepisode here at ITVProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.490\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and in today's\nepisode, while this is a fun one.\n\n6\n00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.250\nWe're continuing on in our CompTIA\nServer+ SK00004 certification class,\n\n7\n00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.200\nand joining us in the studios today\nis none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.320\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.940\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes,\nready to dive right back into Server+.\n\n10\n00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.770\nAnd we're gonna be tackling\na topic today that is,\n\n11\n00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.900\nit doesn't sound terribly exciting, right?\n\n12\n00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.830\nIt's asset management and documentation.\n\n13\n00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.380\nAnd I can tell you all day long\nhow important documentation is but\n\n14\n00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.160\nit doesn't change the fact\nthat it's boring.\n\n15\n00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.210\nAnd it takes a lot of work and\npeople hate to do it.\n\n16\n00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.790\nAnd people don't do it.\n\n17\n00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.010\nYou get a lot of that where people just\nneglect to keep their systems documented,\n\n18\n00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.160\nbut the value of having good\nasset management documentation is\n\n19\n00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.360\nworth its weight in gold.\n\n20\n00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.360\nIt is super important.\n\n21\n00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.300\nSo even if you hate doing it,\n\n22\n00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.570\nyou need to take a little bit of time and\nmake sure that you get it set up right.\n\n23\n00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.710\nSo let's start off really simple with what\nthe heck am I even talking about here.\n\n24\n00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.000\nWell what is asset management and\ndocumentation?\n\n25\n00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.390\nWell documentation we should already know.\n\n26\n00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.480\nWhenever we set up a system,\nwhenever we purchase servers,\n\n27\n00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.670\nwhenever we install an operating system.\n\n28\n00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.020\nWe configure backups.\n\n29\n00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.740\nWe should be documenting what we do.\n\n30\n00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.660\nWriting it down on paper.\n\n31\n00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.160\nHey, I just setup this backup software.\n\n32\n00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.080\nI'm gonna write that down.\n\n33\n00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.170\nI setup a backup software.\n\n34\n00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.910\nSo I know when it was installed.\n\n35\n00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.050\nWho did it, right, how they did it.\n\n36\n00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.120\nAnd the reason we need to know how they\ndid it is, if we ever have to rebuild our\n\n37\n00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.820\nenvironment, if we have to do disaster\nrecovery, we need to go through and\n\n38\n00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.980\nrebuild that stuff, right?\n\n39\n00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.220\nAnd then when I deploy\nthe backup software,\n\n40\n00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.380\nI then need to create\ndocumentation on how to use it,\n\n41\n00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.220\nhow to make sure it's running fine,\nhow to do maintenance on it.\n\n42\n00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.380\nAnd how to actually recover lost\ndata with the backup software.\n\n43\n00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.420\nAnd we have all that document, and\n\n44\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.250\nwe know how to use the technology\nthat we purchased.\n\n45\n00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.160\nA lot of people never even bother learning\nthe technology they purchased, better yet\n\n46\n00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.670\ndocumenting the technology.\n\n47\n00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.056\nAnd that's when we get\nsayings like the 80/20 rule.\n\n48\n00:02:06.056 --> 00:02:09.750\nWhere 80% of the people only\nuse 20% of the features.\n\n49\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.010\nThat most software goes underutilized,\nand that's a very, very true story.\n\n50\n00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.760\nA lot of people don't use\ntheir software to its fullest\n\n51\n00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.500\nbecause they didn't take time to read the\ndocumentation provided by the vendors and\n\n52\n00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.150\ncreate their own documentation so\nthat people within the company can use\n\n53\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.780\nthat software or\nhardware to its fullest, all right?\n\n54\n00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.100\nSo we're gonna talk more\nabout documentation later on.\n\n55\n00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.900\nBut one of the critical types of\ndocumentation that we're going to do\n\n56\n00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.770\nis what's called asset management, and\nthat's what we're gonna focus on first.\n\n57\n00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.140\nWhen you buy stuff, if you're just\nbuying something for you at home, so\n\n58\n00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.040\nI decide I need a new wireless router for\nhome.\n\n59\n00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.180\nI might go to, I don't know,\n\n60\n00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.010\nan electronics store somebody like Best\nBuy or JB Hi-Fi or somebody like that and\n\n61\n00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.530\nI go and buy a router and I hook it up\nat home and that's the end of it right?\n\n62\n00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.440\nI don't have to get permission,\nwell maybe from my wife, right?\n\n63\n00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.650\nBut I don't have to fill out forms and\n\n64\n00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.590\ndo a business case scenario or\nanything like that.\n\n65\n00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.400\nI just go and buy it and that's that.\n\n66\n00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.530\nBecause we're talking about\nthe economics of a home, right,\n\n67\n00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.760\nso not a huge amount of money.\n\n68\n00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.980\nIt was, well my home.\n\n69\n00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.600\nBut when you talk about a business where\nyou might have a multi-billion dollar\n\n70\n00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.510\norganization that's spread\nacross multiple continents and\n\n71\n00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.870\nyou're not buying one router,\nyou're buying 1,000 routers.\n\n72\n00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.300\nAnd those routers don't cost $100,\nthose routers cost $4,000 each.\n\n73\n00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.520\nNow you're talking about\nbig amounts of money.\n\n74\n00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.230\nAnd there needs to be a process in place\nfor how you choose what equipment you\n\n75\n00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.520\npurchase, how you purchase it, how you\nnegotiate the price of that purchase.\n\n76\n00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.790\nAnd that is the first stage of what's\ncalled the equipment lifecycle.\n\n77\n00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.180\nEvery device has a lifecycle\nthat it goes through and\n\n78\n00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.480\nasset management is how\nwe track that lifecycle.\n\n79\n00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.310\nIt starts with selecting the equipment.\n\n80\n00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.900\nHow do you pick what the heck\nit is you're gonna buy?\n\n81\n00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.480\nAnd different companies have\ndifferent procedures for that.\n\n82\n00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.130\nI have a friend who works for a really\nlarge organization, where his job is R&amp;D,\n\n83\n00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.990\nhe's in research and development.\n\n84\n00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.620\nHe doesn't actually deploy\nany production equipment.\n\n85\n00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.020\nI make fun of him for it all the time,\ncuz he doesn't actually do anything.\n\n86\n00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.850\nWell, anything that end users notice.\n\n87\n00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.020\nWhat he does is stuff that\nend users don't notice.\n\n88\n00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.920\nHe's one who will test out ten different\nrouters, or ten different firewalls, and\n\n89\n00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.220\nmake sure they meet\nthe needs of the company.\n\n90\n00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.600\nAnd select the best one, based on price,\nperformance, reliability, and a number\n\n91\n00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.060\nof other criteria that they've defined and\nprioritize is important for that company.\n\n92\n00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.760\nThat's stage one of a lifecycle, selecting\nthe equipment and then acquiring it.\n\n93\n00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.390\nThen you've got configuring the equipment.\n\n94\n00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.210\nIt's gotta be configured.\n\n95\n00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.330\nIt has to have a configuration\nplaced on it so\n\n96\n00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.670\nthat it's ready to work in production.\n\n97\n00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.890\nThen we deploy it, it actually goes\ninto production and is put into use.\n\n98\n00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.490\nAnd from there we maintain it, right?\n\n99\n00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.090\nWe watch the equipment, make sure it\ndoes the job it's supposed to do.\n\n100\n00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.150\nAnd then finally after several years,\n\n101\n00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.990\nhopefully, we identify that it's\ntime to replace the equipment.\n\n102\n00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.410\nMaybe faster and\nnewer technologies have come out.\n\n103\n00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.520\nMaybe the hardware is wearing down,\nsome moving parts like fans,\n\n104\n00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.930\neventually they go bad.\n\n105\n00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.350\nMaybe the warranty is no longer valid.\n\n106\n00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.290\nIf you buy a server,\n\n107\n00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.430\nif you go to Dell or HP, you can get\nthree year warranties all day long.\n\n108\n00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.510\nOn some of the equipment you can\nextend to a five year warranty.\n\n109\n00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.440\nBut beyond five years, it's pretty hard to\nget warranty service on that equipment and\n\n110\n00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.060\nso maybe we are just coming up around year\nfour and we know your five is coming up\n\n111\n00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.890\nand our warranty is coming up,\nwe need to replace the server.\n\n112\n00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.360\nThat's part of that lifecycle.\n\n113\n00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.283\nSo now we start identifying\nthe replacement and\n\n114\n00:05:31.283 --> 00:05:33.530\nthe lifecycle starts again, right.\n\n115\n00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.070\nWe pick the replacement.\n\n116\n00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.340\nWe configure the replacement.\n\n117\n00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.010\nWe deploy the replacement.\n\n118\n00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.850\nWe maintain the replacement.\n\n119\n00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.560\nAnd eventually we replace and\nfinally dispose of the replacement.\n\n120\n00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.710\nThe disposition is that end piece where we\nactually toss the equipment into the junk.\n\n121\n00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.190\nSo that's the equipment lifecycle.\n\n122\n00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.420\nAnd asset management is all\nabout tracking that lifecycle.\n\n123\n00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.020\nWhat equipment do we have?\n\n124\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.520\nWhat version is it?\n\n125\n00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.500\nHow much did it cost?\n\n126\n00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.370\nWas PO was issued for it?\n\n127\n00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.790\nIs it under warranty?\n\n128\n00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.330\nIf it's not under warranty or if it's\ncoming up on its end, when is the end?\n\n129\n00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.770\nWhen does it run out of warranty?\n\n130\n00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.130\nIf something goes wrong and\nit's under warranty, who do we call?\n\n131\n00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.260\nThat is part of asset management.\n\n132\n00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.400\nAnd this way, when you walk into big\ncorporations or you go into a hospital or\n\n133\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.910\na school and you see a laptop,\nthat yeah you might see a Dell logo or\n\n134\n00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.560\na HP logo or an Apple logo or whatever.\n\n135\n00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.010\nBut not too far from there,\nyou'll see a little asset label.\n\n136\n00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.010\nA label that will say something like,\nIT ProTV 00124768 and so\n\n137\n00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:39.930\nwe know that's the IT ProTV asset label,\nthe asset tag.\n\n138\n00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.060\nAnd then when that laptop was purchased\nthat's the number we assigned it.\n\n139\n00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.418\nSo that we can go into our system and look\nup that number and find that exact laptop\n\n140\n00:06:48.418 --> 00:06:52.579\nand, find out is it under warranty,\nhow much did we pay for it, how long have\n\n141\n00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:56.703\nwe had it for, all the other things\nthat are part of that asset management.\n\n142\n00:06:56.703 --> 00:06:57.540\nAll right now,\n\n143\n00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.740\nwhy use an asset tag instead of\nusing the serial number for a unit?\n\n144\n00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.760\nBecause that my laptop has a serial\nnumber, Wes' laptop has a serial number,\n\n145\n00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.750\nin fact our,\nboth of our laptops are Apple laptops.\n\n146\n00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:12.010\nSo the serial numbers are very similar but\nwe got the TV that\n\n147\n00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.040\nI'm looking at right ahead here or the\ncamera the robotic camera I'm staring at.\n\n148\n00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.280\nWe've got lights and\nthings they got serial numbers but\n\n149\n00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.550\nthey're in a different format.\n\n150\n00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.280\nDifferent companies choose the format for\nthe serial number.\n\n151\n00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.100\nIf it's a small company that serial\nnumber might just be six numbers.\n\n152\n00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.890\nBut if it's somebody like Apple, it's\ngonna be a long number with letters and\n\n153\n00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.220\nnumbers so they can maximize that, right.\n\n154\n00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.790\nIt's gonna get bigger and\nbigger and bigger.\n\n155\n00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.630\nSo different serial number formats make it\n\n156\n00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.960\nwere that's not a really\ngreat way to track a system.\n\n157\n00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.240\nAnd sometimes it's just annoying,\n\n158\n00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.880\nright, because the serial number will\nbe written underneath the computer or\n\n159\n00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.250\nyou got to like, on a server, a lot of\ntimes they'll put it on top of the server.\n\n160\n00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.240\nSo, you got to slide the server\n\n161\n00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.740\nout of the rack to be able to see\nthe serial number on top of it.\n\n162\n00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.739\nWhen we make our own asset tags,\nyou can put it wherever you want.\n\n163\n00:07:55.739 --> 00:07:58.849\nYou can put right on\nthe faceplate of the server and\n\n164\n00:07:58.849 --> 00:08:01.303\nnow I can see the asset tag right there.\n\n165\n00:08:01.303 --> 00:08:03.209\nI know exactly where I can go and\nlook that up.\n\n166\n00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:06.909\nNow, Once I have an asset tag,\nwhat does that correspond to?\n\n167\n00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:11.420\nWell, we're typically gonna leverage\nsome kinda asset management software.\n\n168\n00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.770\nAnd that asset management software can be\nreally fancy or it can be really low tech.\n\n169\n00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.560\nIt could be no tech.\n\n170\n00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.450\nThe old way of asset management is anytime\nI bought something, I got an invoice and\n\n171\n00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:22.410\nI stuck it in a file.\n\n172\n00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.560\nAnd then, when it came to have me\nlook it up again, I shifted to\n\n173\n00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.620\na bunch of file until I find it with take\nhours to find anything it was a nightmare.\n\n174\n00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.420\nBut thanks to computers, we can\nactually automate a lot of this stuff.\n\n175\n00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.680\nAnd a simple spreadsheet is all you need.\n\n176\n00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.820\nA spreadsheet with one column, that is\nthe tag number and the other column is\n\n177\n00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.700\nthe serial number and another column\nis the purchase date and another column\n\n178\n00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.060\nthat's the warranty expiration date,\nthe basic information you need.\n\n179\n00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.260\nBut as time goes on,\nyou're gonna find that you have more and\n\n180\n00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.800\nmore information you need to track.\n\n181\n00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.670\nMore and more stuff that's considered\nimportant for your company.\n\n182\n00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.940\nAnd as you create\nadditional documentation,\n\n183\n00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.690\nthat's gonna get wrapped up into this.\n\n184\n00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.550\nAnd things start to get more and\nmore complex.\n\n185\n00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.870\nAnd a simple spreadsheet\ncan't hack it anymore.\n\n186\n00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.780\nAnd so, there are a number\nof companies out there that\n\n187\n00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.890\nmake amazing asset management software.\n\n188\n00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.150\nSome of it can even do\nautomatic discovery,\n\n189\n00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.785\nwhere it can scan your network and\nfind the devices on the network.\n\n190\n00:09:19.785 --> 00:09:22.670\nAnd add the serial number and\nadd a little inflation.\n\n191\n00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.567\nCan't tell you if it's only one or two.\n\n192\n00:09:24.567 --> 00:09:26.890\nCan't tell you the one that was\npurchased or how much you paid.\n\n193\n00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.450\nBut you can at least harvest the inventory\nand get it put into the system so\n\n194\n00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.380\nyou don't have to start from scratch.\n\n195\n00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.000\nBut the key piece about any of\nthe software is just make it quick and\n\n196\n00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.720\neasy to be able to determine where\nin the lifecycle that equipment is.\n\n197\n00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.740\nAnd how it should be managed and\nhow it should be tracked.\n\n198\n00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.000\nFrom an IT side, I care about that.\n\n199\n00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.590\nI want my equipment to keep running,\nand keeping it under warranty,\n\n200\n00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.270\nkeeping it refreshed at\na proper interval is important.\n\n201\n00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.220\nBut from a financial side,\nyou're more than likely required.\n\n202\n00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:00.290\nWhen a company buys a server, that's\na physical asset that the company owns.\n\n203\n00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.170\nAnd it has a certain value.\n\n204\n00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:05.850\nAnd that value is something\nyou have to pay taxes on.\n\n205\n00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:10.340\nWell, each year the value of that server\ndecreases and it's called depreciation.\n\n206\n00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.710\nSo every year it depreciates in value and\n\n207\n00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.170\nso they can pay less taxes on\nit because it depreciated.\n\n208\n00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.269\nOr what they actually do is take\na loss and you get a tax discount.\n\n209\n00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:20.600\nWe won't get into that.\n\n210\n00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.310\nWe'll save that for\nITs CPA TV, and [LAUGH] so\n\n211\n00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.030\nwe'll get into that some other day.\n\n212\n00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:30.800\nBut basically as a financial reason,\nthey need to track what they own, and\n\n213\n00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.270\nhow much they paid for it.\n\n214\n00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:36.270\nAnd then, that way when it is time to\ndispose of the equipment, they can write\n\n215\n00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:41.760\nthat off as a material asset that\nthey no longer have possession of.\n\n216\n00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.070\n&gt;&gt; You know Don, I've seen, especially\nas hosting with you on this show too,\n\n217\n00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.870\nthat certain devices you can buy them and\nyou think,\n\n218\n00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.490\nnow I've got the functionality\nthat I need, I'm ready to go.\n\n219\n00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.310\nAnd then,\nif you haven't done your research I guess,\n\n220\n00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.130\nif you do your research this\nisn't a problem, you realize that\n\n221\n00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.200\ncertain functionalities that you need,\nthey're behind a wall of money,\n\n222\n00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.090\nyou have to add-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n223\n00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:00.950\n&gt;&gt; That functionality.\n\n224\n00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.860\nI could think of the Cisco ASAs.\n\n225\n00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.520\nWhat do you get, like ten licenses for\nvery small devices.\n\n226\n00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.035\nAnd as you need to grow\nyour organization out,\n\n227\n00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:11.626\nwhere does licensing\ncome into play with this?\n\n228\n00:11:11.626 --> 00:11:12.697\n&gt;&gt; So that's very important.\n\n229\n00:11:12.697 --> 00:11:13.790\nYou mentioned the ASAs, right?\n\n230\n00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:19.880\nSo if you buy the base level ASA,\nthe what is it these days, the 550x or\n\n231\n00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:25.700\nwhatever it is, when you get those\ndevices, they come with a 10 user license.\n\n232\n00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.740\nWell, if you put it in a branch office\nwith 11 users, that's not gonna work.\n\n233\n00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.800\nSo you've gotta bump up to a 50 user\nlicense or an unlimited user license.\n\n234\n00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.590\nSo I might have ten of the exact same\nfirewalls sitting in front of me, but\n\n235\n00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.620\ndifferent software licenses on them.\n\n236\n00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.440\nNow, it's important because, one,\n\n237\n00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.040\nI need to make sure I'm deploying\nthe right firewalls in the right place.\n\n238\n00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.780\nIf I have an office with only 5 users,\n\n239\n00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.320\nI don't wanna give them\na 50 user license firewall.\n\n240\n00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.280\nI wanna give them a ten user license\nfirewall and makes more sense.\n\n241\n00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.220\nBut also when it comes\nto renewing maintenance,\n\n242\n00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.170\nCISCO has what's called\nSmart Net agreement.\n\n243\n00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:55.940\nSmart Net, that's like their warranty.\n\n244\n00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.150\nBuy year after year and\n\n245\n00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.560\nthey get you tech support and\nin-software updates and all that.\n\n246\n00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.810\nOn a firewall,\nyou definitely want your software updates.\n\n247\n00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:07.360\nSo when you go to renew,\nyou pay more to renew a 50 user\n\n248\n00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.170\nlicense than you do a 10 user license,\ncuz 10 user licenses are built in.\n\n249\n00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.980\nSo you need to make sure you're not\noverpaying if you don't have that cuz\n\n250\n00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.660\nyou've gotta keep track of licensing.\n\n251\n00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.240\nAlso, if you have shared computers,\nthings start to get really tricky.\n\n252\n00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:24.140\nLet's say you're a university, and you've\ngot 1,000 computers at the university.\n\n253\n00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:31.630\nBut you've got 50,000 students, and some\nof those students need access to AutoCAD.\n\n254\n00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.970\nBut not all of them,\njust the architecture students.\n\n255\n00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.073\nAnd maybe there's only 200\narchitecture students.\n\n256\n00:12:37.073 --> 00:12:40.280\nSo you buy 200 copies of AutoCAD.\n\n257\n00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:46.600\nWell, you've got 1,000 computers, and you\nonly bought 200 copies of AutoCAD, if you\n\n258\n00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.700\nput AutoCAD on all 1,000 computers, you're\nin violation of your license, aren't you?\n\n259\n00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.540\nSo you need to be able to track how many\ncomputers have I already installed it on,\n\n260\n00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.750\nand am I over my license?\n\n261\n00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:00.690\nAnd, hey, if I just disposed of a computer\nand replaced it and it had AutoCAD on it,\n\n262\n00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.720\nthat just freed up a license and\nI can now deploy it somewhere else.\n\n263\n00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.500\nVersus, I just disposed my computer, and\nit took its AutoCad license with it.\n\n264\n00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.420\nAnd now I'm paying for a license that I\ncan't even use cuz I think it's gone.\n\n265\n00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.500\nSo tracking licensing like\nthat is really important.\n\n266\n00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.150\nMicrosoft Windows Server,\nRed Hat Enterprise,\n\n267\n00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.732\nLinux, well, I was about to say Ubuntu.\n\n268\n00:13:20.732 --> 00:13:23.080\nUbuntu Server is free to just go ahead and\ndownload.\n\n269\n00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.030\nBut if you wanna support,\nyou've got to pay for commercial sports.\n\n270\n00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.760\nYou've got support agreements\nthat are on top of that.\n\n271\n00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.880\nThese are all things that need to be\ntracked and renewed because you don't want\n\n272\n00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.210\nto run into a situation where a server\nis not working, the network is down,\n\n273\n00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.490\nusers are complaining,\nyou get on the phone with Red Hat and\n\n274\n00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.430\nthey say,\nit looks like your maintenance is expired.\n\n275\n00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.990\nWould you like to renew your maintenance?\n\n276\n00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.230\nAnd at this point you're panicked and\nyou're like, yes, absolutely.\n\n277\n00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.953\nI'll do it.\n\n278\n00:13:44.953 --> 00:13:47.860\nAnd they say, well,\nwe need to get a purchase order.\n\n279\n00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.820\nAnd then, you realize the red tape and\n\n280\n00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.530\nthe bureaucracy it is to get a company\nto spend money on something simple.\n\n281\n00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.280\nAnd I've had this happen myself.\n\n282\n00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.810\nI'm like, you know what,\ncan I put it on my personal credit card?\n\n283\n00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.567\nI'll work out the expense later on.\n\n284\n00:14:00.567 --> 00:14:02.940\nAnd it's just you don't\nwanna be in that situation.\n\n285\n00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.200\nYou should have known\nthat that was expired and\n\n286\n00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.480\nasset management does that for us.\n\n287\n00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I was gonna ask you.\n\n288\n00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.005\nI was thinking have you ever\nrun into a situation like that?\n\n289\n00:14:10.005 --> 00:14:12.520\nCuz I know a company that I\nused to work for, we had to\n\n290\n00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.750\nupgrade the firmware on an EqualLogic box,\nand our service contract had stopped.\n\n291\n00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.492\nAnd apparently the firmware updates\nare part of that service contract.\n\n292\n00:14:20.492 --> 00:14:21.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n293\n00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.860\nin order to do the firmware\nupdate on the EqualLogic box we\n\n294\n00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.650\nhad to pay a $1,000 service contract\njust to upgrade to the newest firmware.\n\n295\n00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:28.612\nHave you ever run into\nsomething like that?\n\n296\n00:14:28.612 --> 00:14:29.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n297\n00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.370\nAnd I don't like that practice, especially\nwhen security updates are a part of it.\n\n298\n00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.765\nI think that's kinda unfair\nthat companies do that.\n\n299\n00:14:35.765 --> 00:14:38.740\nBut if you want them to\ncontinue releasing updates for\n\n300\n00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.560\nthe hardware that have to have a revenue\nstream, and so that's how they show it.\n\n301\n00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.720\nIf people weren't paying, they would\njust abandon the hardware and say,\n\n302\n00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.550\nwe're not gonna release updates for\nthat anymore.\n\n303\n00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.940\nAnd then, you're stuck with\nunsupported hardware that's worse\n\n304\n00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.410\nthen just having to pay a little bit for\nmaintenance.\n\n305\n00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.020\nThe other thing to think about though\nis sometimes it's not that big of deal\n\n306\n00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:55.950\nas far as money.\n\n307\n00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.150\nAnd I can do things like, say,\nI'll put it on my personal credit card.\n\n308\n00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:02.450\nIf they tell me, well, you've got to\npay $1,000 to renew your maintenance.\n\n309\n00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.642\nGreat, I'll do it.\n\n310\n00:15:03.642 --> 00:15:07.900\nI'll pay the $1,000 and then I'll get\na reimbursement from the company.\n\n311\n00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.680\nBut if it's enterprise grade software and\n\n312\n00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.030\nthey tell you that renewal is $120,000?\n\n313\n00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:17.590\nI don't have a credit card that big.\n\n314\n00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.931\nI don't have a credit card half that big,\n[LAUGH] so you can't do it.\n\n315\n00:15:20.931 --> 00:15:24.537\nAnd now you're stuck, now you've got to\nget the whole purchase environment moving\n\n316\n00:15:24.537 --> 00:15:26.030\nthrough and that's a nightmare.\n\n317\n00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.539\nI've talked way more about\nthis than I wanted to,\n\n318\n00:15:28.539 --> 00:15:31.067\nI wanted to show you guys\nkind of what this is like.\n\n319\n00:15:31.067 --> 00:15:33.710\nAnd there's a number of different\nsoftware packages that are out there.\n\n320\n00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.943\nYou're welcome to use anyone but\nI wanted to show you one real example and\n\n321\n00:15:36.943 --> 00:15:40.725\nthat's a pack as I like that's out there\ncalled the SolarWinds Web Help Desk.\n\n322\n00:15:40.725 --> 00:15:43.552\nSolarWinds and they can ton of\ndifferent of software packages.\n\n323\n00:15:43.552 --> 00:15:47.677\nBut their Web Help Desk is a really cool\neasy to use sweep that lets you manage\n\n324\n00:15:47.677 --> 00:15:48.670\nyour resources.\n\n325\n00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.659\nAnd it's also does thickening and\n\n326\n00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:55.186\nyou'll see plenty of pieces that merge\nas a management and thickening because\n\n327\n00:15:55.186 --> 00:15:59.588\nif we have a failed hard drive, and\nwe repair it, that's a service ticket.\n\n328\n00:15:59.588 --> 00:16:02.418\nWell, that service ticket\nwas performed on an asset.\n\n329\n00:16:02.418 --> 00:16:05.441\nAnd I don't normally care about that,\ntoo much, cuz we replace the hard drive,\n\n330\n00:16:05.441 --> 00:16:06.475\nit's fine, it's fixed.\n\n331\n00:16:06.475 --> 00:16:10.238\nBut if I'm repeatedly seeing failed\nhard drives on the same asset,\n\n332\n00:16:10.238 --> 00:16:14.810\nthat's a great indicator that there's\na problem with that server, right?\n\n333\n00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.760\nAnd that I need to maybe\nescalate replacing that server or\n\n334\n00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.000\nlook for what's causing this\npattern of failure in that server.\n\n335\n00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.660\nSo, we can track that better if the\nservice tickets are attached to the asset.\n\n336\n00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.100\nI can pull up a server and say,\n\n337\n00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.900\nshow me all the service tickets that have\never been entered in for this one server.\n\n338\n00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:32.457\nAnd I can see it.\n\n339\n00:16:32.457 --> 00:16:35.198\nAnd I can see if it's under warranty,\nand I can see when I bought it.\n\n340\n00:16:35.198 --> 00:16:38.370\nAnd I can look for other servers that\nwere purchased at the same time.\n\n341\n00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.160\nWe can start to correlate information.\n\n342\n00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.653\nAnd start to spot trends and issues.\n\n343\n00:16:43.653 --> 00:16:49.467\nThat was never more true for\nme than in, it was probably 2004.\n\n344\n00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:52.324\nWhere there was the big,\nthey called it cap gate,\n\n345\n00:16:52.324 --> 00:16:56.694\nthe big capacitor scandal of 2003,\n2004, right around in there.\n\n346\n00:16:56.694 --> 00:17:00.569\nWhere there was a factory in Asia\nthat was manufacturing capacitors and\n\n347\n00:17:00.569 --> 00:17:02.774\nthey didn't manufacture them to spec.\n\n348\n00:17:02.774 --> 00:17:06.281\nAnd so there were tons of devices out\nthere that were being sent out with\n\n349\n00:17:06.281 --> 00:17:09.145\ncapacitors that would die\nafter only two or three years.\n\n350\n00:17:09.145 --> 00:17:11.952\nAnd they should have been able to run for\na long time, but after two or\n\n351\n00:17:11.952 --> 00:17:13.144\nthree years they would pop.\n\n352\n00:17:13.144 --> 00:17:17.498\nAnd we had Dell desktops\nwhere we bought probably 6 or\n\n353\n00:17:17.498 --> 00:17:20.315\n700 of these things in a batch.\n\n354\n00:17:20.315 --> 00:17:22.514\nAnd we had lost over half\nof them after one year.\n\n355\n00:17:22.514 --> 00:17:25.650\nAnd we lost all of them by\nthe end of the second year.\n\n356\n00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:27.858\nBut we were able to see\nthat trend very early on.\n\n357\n00:17:27.858 --> 00:17:30.870\nThat we were having more failed\nmotherboards than normal on this\n\n358\n00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.610\nparticular model,\nbecause we were tracking it that way.\n\n359\n00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.250\nSo that's part of what\nasset management does.\n\n360\n00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.830\nSo to demonstrate asset management,\nI wanna show you guys a software package.\n\n361\n00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.310\nIt's called SolarWinds Help Desk, and\nSolarWinds makes a ton of software.\n\n362\n00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.315\nThis is just one of the various\nsoftware packages they make.\n\n363\n00:17:44.315 --> 00:17:47.145\nI like this one cuz it's web based so\nit's easy to use.\n\n364\n00:17:47.145 --> 00:17:48.674\nAnd it does help desk.\n\n365\n00:17:48.674 --> 00:17:52.040\nIt does ticketing as well as asset\nmanagement, all kind of wrapped into one.\n\n366\n00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.855\nAnd we're gonna talk more\nabout ticketing later on.\n\n367\n00:17:54.855 --> 00:17:57.515\nI'm gonna focus on the asset\nmanagement side of things right now.\n\n368\n00:17:57.515 --> 00:18:00.880\nBut with software like this,\nthey try to make things simple.\n\n369\n00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.950\nIt can scan the network,\nfind out what's on your network, and\n\n370\n00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:05.480\nstart to catalog it for you.\n\n371\n00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.300\nAnd then after that,\nyou can start to update things yourself.\n\n372\n00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.760\nAnd so what I'm gonna do is go in here and\n\n373\n00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.670\nkind of take look at my\nasset side of things.\n\n374\n00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:18.870\nAnd when we go in the assets, what you'll\nnotice is that we have search assets,\n\n375\n00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.910\npurchase orders, and reservations, right?\n\n376\n00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:26.790\nWhen you have assets, there are going to\nbe some that you don't actually have yet.\n\n377\n00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.909\nIf I've decided to purchase a server and\nI've placed the order with HPE,\n\n378\n00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:33.175\nbut I haven't received the server yet.\n\n379\n00:18:33.175 --> 00:18:35.787\nIt's still an asset that\nwe know it's coming and so\n\n380\n00:18:35.787 --> 00:18:37.505\nI'll have a place holder for it.\n\n381\n00:18:37.505 --> 00:18:40.912\nI'll have a reservation or purchase\norder that was created for that unit.\n\n382\n00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:44.128\nAnd I might wanna search based on\nthat purchase order so I can do it.\n\n383\n00:18:44.128 --> 00:18:47.424\nBut typically we're focused more on\nthe assets that we actually have.\n\n384\n00:18:47.424 --> 00:18:51.235\nAnd worry about maintenance and so on for\nthe assets that we've already got.\n\n385\n00:18:51.235 --> 00:18:55.225\nAnd so we can come in and search for\nthings, I'm gonna search based on,\n\n386\n00:18:55.225 --> 00:18:58.655\nwe'll do asset name,\nwhere is asset name in here?\n\n387\n00:18:58.655 --> 00:19:01.780\nAnd we can come in,\nwe can search and filter, and so\n\n388\n00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.409\non cuz you might have thousands of assets.\n\n389\n00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:06.031\nRemember that we're not\njust tracking servers.\n\n390\n00:19:06.031 --> 00:19:10.592\nYou're probably tracking laptops,\ndesktops, printers,\n\n391\n00:19:10.592 --> 00:19:15.607\nscanners, firewalls, routers,\neven non computer components.\n\n392\n00:19:15.607 --> 00:19:20.617\nThings like projectors, whiteboards, you\nmight be tracking all those as assets too.\n\n393\n00:19:20.617 --> 00:19:22.670\nAll of that kind of comes into play.\n\n394\n00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.540\nSo I'm gonna look for it here.\n\n395\n00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.460\nLet me just try and\nfind domain controllers.\n\n396\n00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.380\nSo I'm gonna look for\nany domain controllers that I've got.\n\n397\n00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.370\nAnd I've got one walking domain\ncontroller sitting here.\n\n398\n00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.620\nAnd so we can take this domain controller\nand pull up its asset information.\n\n399\n00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.302\nAnd the asset information that\nyou track is really up to you.\n\n400\n00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:40.030\nThere are gonna be things that\nyou view as important and\n\n401\n00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.480\nthings that you view as not important.\n\n402\n00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.060\nThings like location and room,\nthat's probably important.\n\n403\n00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.710\nHey I've got this server\nwhere the heck is it?\n\n404\n00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:52.430\nIf your company has 110 branches\nspread across 20 countries\n\n405\n00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:55.040\nyou might have a hard time\nremembering where a server is.\n\n406\n00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.896\nAnd it might be a physical location like\nthis or it might be an individual rack.\n\n407\n00:19:59.896 --> 00:20:06.772\nIf I have a data center it might say row\nfive, rack seven use eight through ten.\n\n408\n00:20:06.772 --> 00:20:10.770\nAnd so now I know exactly where to\ngo on the racks to find that server.\n\n409\n00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.189\nBecause honestly when you walk into\na data center and there are rows and\n\n410\n00:20:13.189 --> 00:20:14.950\nrows of servers, they all look the same.\n\n411\n00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:16.612\nEvery darn one of them looks the same.\n\n412\n00:20:16.612 --> 00:20:19.060\nAnd if it's a busy day in\nthe center you might think.\n\n413\n00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.516\nI'll just I remote into it and I'll turn\non the UID light that little blinking blue\n\n414\n00:20:22.516 --> 00:20:24.032\nlight that helps you find a server.\n\n415\n00:20:24.032 --> 00:20:26.304\nWell if it's a busy data center\nother people are doing that too.\n\n416\n00:20:26.304 --> 00:20:30.430\nAnd I'll tell you, people always\nforget to turn the UID light off.\n\n417\n00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.108\nAnd so there are blinking blue\nlights everywhere, it doesn't help.\n\n418\n00:20:32.108 --> 00:20:34.370\nSo you need a way to find that.\n\n419\n00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.200\nSo we can track that location.\n\n420\n00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.820\nIf it's tied to clients how many clients\nare attached to that particular resource?\n\n421\n00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.060\nHow many people would I affect\nif I shut this server down?\n\n422\n00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.730\nThat's something I might choose to track.\n\n423\n00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:50.840\nContract expiration, i f it's under\nwarranty, when does the warranty expire?\n\n424\n00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.570\nNow, having it logged in like\nthis helps me two different ways.\n\n425\n00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.400\nOne way,\nI can say I'm doing work on this server.\n\n426\n00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.090\nIs it under warranty?\n\n427\n00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:01.000\nI can pull it up, and I can see, right?\n\n428\n00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.825\nThe other thing is I can,\nas an accountant type, I could say,\n\n429\n00:21:04.825 --> 00:21:09.031\nhow many servers are gonna have\ntheir warranty expire in 2017?\n\n430\n00:21:09.031 --> 00:21:10.026\nAnd I go and pull that, and\n\n431\n00:21:10.026 --> 00:21:12.070\nget a whole list of all\nthe servers that need to renew.\n\n432\n00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.390\nAnd now we can plan our budget around\nthat to make sure that they get renewed.\n\n433\n00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:16.951\nBut we're able to track it.\n\n434\n00:21:16.951 --> 00:21:19.825\nIf it's something that we\nprovide client services on.\n\n435\n00:21:19.825 --> 00:21:22.654\nWe might have a billing rate for\nwhat we bill those people,\n\n436\n00:21:22.654 --> 00:21:24.790\nwhether it's reservable and so on.\n\n437\n00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:29.020\nAnd if there are child assets,\nnow what's a child asset?\n\n438\n00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.230\nIf I have a server, and let's say it\nonly has eight drive bays in it, but\n\n439\n00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:34.480\nI need 14 drives in the thing.\n\n440\n00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:39.260\nI might get an external drive enclosure\nthat's direct attach storage.\n\n441\n00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.660\nIt has a SCSI cable that runs right up\nto the server, as an external enclosure.\n\n442\n00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.390\nPlenty of people use these.\n\n443\n00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:46.850\nWell the external enclosure\nis bought separately.\n\n444\n00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.378\nIt's got its own serial number.\n\n445\n00:21:48.378 --> 00:21:50.910\nIt's got its own warranty\nthat you maintain and\n\n446\n00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:52.660\nit's got drives that are inside of it.\n\n447\n00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.240\nWell that's gonna be\nconsidered a child asset.\n\n448\n00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.370\nThat enclosure doesn't\nwork without the server.\n\n449\n00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:03.570\nIt's tied to the server but its\nmaintenance and all of that is separate.\n\n450\n00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:07.490\nAnd you might have several child\nassets tied to a particular resource.\n\n451\n00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.920\nAnd so you can start to log those in.\n\n452\n00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.070\nNow the screen that I'm on here\nis just letting you view it, but\n\n453\n00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.480\nI can edit this information.\n\n454\n00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.070\nAnd when I go to edit it, now I can\ndive in and start to customize and\n\n455\n00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.810\nchange all of this.\n\n456\n00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:21.850\nI can define my rooms, if I've actually\ndefined that structure in here.\n\n457\n00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:25.180\nWe can start to define\nthe child assets and so\n\n458\n00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.610\non specifying each of those in\nhere based on what my need is.\n\n459\n00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.390\nAnd this are just the basic assets then\nwe start getting the things like our\n\n460\n00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:32.650\ndetails, right?\n\n461\n00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:34.771\nWhat's the serial number for the unit?\n\n462\n00:22:34.771 --> 00:22:37.323\nIf I'm having a problem with\nthat domain controller and\n\n463\n00:22:37.323 --> 00:22:38.960\nit looks like a hard drive failure.\n\n464\n00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.928\nAnd I need to call Lenovo to\nget a replacement hard drive.\n\n465\n00:22:42.928 --> 00:22:46.380\nI don't want to have to go into the server\nroom and slide the server out of the rack.\n\n466\n00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.834\nSo that I can read the little\nserial number right off the top or\n\n467\n00:22:48.834 --> 00:22:49.951\nDell puts them on the back.\n\n468\n00:22:49.951 --> 00:22:51.000\nAnd it's always dark.\n\n469\n00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.850\nNow you've got to get a flashlight and\nyou've got to shine it in there.\n\n470\n00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.840\nAnd try and see, it's a pain.\n\n471\n00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.360\nWell, I can just pull it up right here.\n\n472\n00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.010\nHere's my serial number.\n\n473\n00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:00.210\nNow how does a serial number get in there?\n\n474\n00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.790\nMaybe we have a network management\nsoftware that lets us gather that data.\n\n475\n00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.380\nBut normally whenever you buy hardware,\n\n476\n00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.410\nsomebody checks it in as part\nof the procurement process.\n\n477\n00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.311\nAnd by checking it in,\nI mean they enter it right here.\n\n478\n00:23:13.311 --> 00:23:16.110\nThey punch in the name of the server,\nthe serial number.\n\n479\n00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.077\nThe IP address and\n\n480\n00:23:17.077 --> 00:23:20.630\nname that's gonna be assigned to\nit if we have that information.\n\n481\n00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:21.657\nWe might not have that information yet.\n\n482\n00:23:21.657 --> 00:23:23.443\nIn which case,\nthis becomes a place holder.\n\n483\n00:23:23.443 --> 00:23:25.609\nAnd we put the serial number in.\n\n484\n00:23:25.609 --> 00:23:27.761\nAnd then when it comes\ntime to actually apply or\n\n485\n00:23:27.761 --> 00:23:29.810\nprovision that server in our environment.\n\n486\n00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.730\nThen we have to come back and\nrepopulate this.\n\n487\n00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:36.240\nThis becomes part of our\ndocumentation process.\n\n488\n00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.750\nAny time I deploy a new server, I've\ngotta come and update this information.\n\n489\n00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.730\nSome of them it be dynamically gathered,\nright.\n\n490\n00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:45.010\nAnd that way if I do an operating\nsystem upgrade or whatever,\n\n491\n00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:46.470\nit's automatically entered in here.\n\n492\n00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.670\nBut some of it can't be,\nsome of it has to be manually entered in.\n\n493\n00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.080\nThere's no way the system can\nfigure out what my warranty is.\n\n494\n00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.020\nSo I've got to come in and tell it,\nit's got a three year warranty.\n\n495\n00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.610\nAnd here's the purchase date.\n\n496\n00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:58.430\nSo it's three years\nfrom the purchase date.\n\n497\n00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.870\nOr we can put in a purchase\norder number and tied to that.\n\n498\n00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:04.788\nBecause I might have one purchase\norder for 700 desktops, and so\n\n499\n00:24:04.788 --> 00:24:05.897\nI can put those in.\n\n500\n00:24:05.897 --> 00:24:07.856\nYou might have received them\non different dates, but\n\n501\n00:24:07.856 --> 00:24:09.780\nthey were all purchased on\nthe same purchase order.\n\n502\n00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:14.758\nA lot of times A lot of times warranties\ndo what's called code termination.\n\n503\n00:24:14.758 --> 00:24:19.576\nCode termination is where I might have\nhad 700 laptops that were bought over\n\n504\n00:24:19.576 --> 00:24:24.720\nthe course of two months and all\nare warranties end on the exact same day.\n\n505\n00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.700\nAnd that sounds bad.\n\n506\n00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.760\nYou're like well, I'm technically losing,\n\n507\n00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.320\non some of those I'll lose two months\nof warranty but from a financial and\n\n508\n00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:37.340\naccounting side, it's way easier to renew\nthe 700 warranties on the same day,\n\n509\n00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.930\nthan it is to renew every single\nday over the course of two months.\n\n510\n00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:42.620\nCuz that's when you've\nbrought these laptops in.\n\n511\n00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.550\nSo co-termination is something\nthat is pretty common.\n\n512\n00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.240\nI deal with that with some\nof my personal licenses,\n\n513\n00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.750\nthe software licenses that I use.\n\n514\n00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:52.100\nSo you might have to specify\nthat in here too, all right?\n\n515\n00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.530\nIf you're PCI complaint or\nyou have other regulations,\n\n516\n00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.530\nyou might need to do audits on\nthe equipment periodically.\n\n517\n00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:01.450\nAnd so you can set the last audit date or\nwhen the next upcoming audit date is.\n\n518\n00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:05.280\nHowever you want to do that and\nother information tacked in here.\n\n519\n00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.230\nThis is all really useful information.\n\n520\n00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.300\nIf you start seeing weird traffic on the\nnetwork and you've got a Mac address for\n\n521\n00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.320\nit, you could search in the asset\ndatabase for that Mac address.\n\n522\n00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.010\nAnd find out exactly what that device was.\n\n523\n00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:19.110\nI know it's IP, I know it's name, I know\nwhat version of software is running,\n\n524\n00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:22.285\nas far as we know assuming\nno one's messed with it.\n\n525\n00:25:22.285 --> 00:25:24.415\n&gt;&gt; Don, one of the things that I'm\nimpressed by the software that you're\n\n526\n00:25:24.415 --> 00:25:27.935\nshowing us is the granular\ndocumentation you can do.\n\n527\n00:25:27.935 --> 00:25:30.065\nIs that something that is\nspecific to solar winds,\n\n528\n00:25:30.065 --> 00:25:32.795\nwhich might be why you like\nit r is it consistency?\n\n529\n00:25:34.495 --> 00:25:36.235\n&gt;&gt; Generally you will find\nmost software has this.\n\n530\n00:25:36.235 --> 00:25:39.895\nNow just we will go off\nthe certification beaten path here.\n\n531\n00:25:39.895 --> 00:25:43.660\nIf you don't have asset management\nsoftware, and you are looking to buy one,\n\n532\n00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:47.190\nthat the key thing for me, and\nmost people fix it on price right.\n\n533\n00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:48.340\nSo price is important.\n\n534\n00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.390\nThe Solar Winds is not the cheapest,\nbut it's also not the most expensive.\n\n535\n00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:56.510\nIt's a reasonable price but a lot of\nasset management software out there\n\n536\n00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.910\nisn't terribly useful\nright out of the box.\n\n537\n00:25:58.910 --> 00:25:59.740\nYou have to customize it.\n\n538\n00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.180\nYou have to get in there and customize\nall sorts of things to get it to work for\n\n539\n00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:07.230\nyour environment and that's one area\nwhere Solar Winds kind of specializes is.\n\n540\n00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.530\nHey, we're gonna make this software\nwork the moment you install it.\n\n541\n00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:11.110\nYou'll be up and running in under an hour.\n\n542\n00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.260\nThat's what I like the best.\n\n543\n00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:15.770\nCuz, I can go to any environment that has\nno asset management and have ' up and\n\n544\n00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.820\nrunning with full asset\nmanagement in an hour.\n\n545\n00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.300\nAnd a ticketing system and so on.\n\n546\n00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:23.670\nSo that's kind of why I like it,\nyou can find a better price out there.\n\n547\n00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:26.910\nYou can probably find more robust and\nmore flexible software out there.\n\n548\n00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:29.790\nBut It just depends on what feature\nit is that you're looking for.\n\n549\n00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.980\nSo there are plenty of other ones.\n\n550\n00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.520\nCA, the computer associates they have\ntrack IT which is a great one or\n\n551\n00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.100\ninform IT.\n\n552\n00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.040\nThey changed the name a few years ago.\n\n553\n00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.090\nAnyhow, so they have some products\nthat they do a really good job.\n\n554\n00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.520\nExcel, you can use it.\n\n555\n00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.310\nQuickBooks, the accounting software\ncan usually do asset management.\n\n556\n00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:47.680\nSo there's tons of other\noptions that are out there too.\n\n557\n00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.660\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, well,\nthat's a lot of great information.\n\n558\n00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.920\nIt does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n559\n00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.550\nBut before we do, I know you might have a\nfew more things you might wanna throw into\n\n560\n00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:56.890\nthis episode, right.\n\n561\n00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI remember that I mentioned the lifecycle.\n\n562\n00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.910\nI need to talk about it a little more.\n\n563\n00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:01.770\nAnd I've got a few more things.\n\n564\n00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:04.610\nWe're gonna have to go into a part two\non this one to delve into all of it.\n\n565\n00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:07.480\nBut remember that when it comes\n\n566\n00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.540\nto the end of a lifecycle when\nwe're no longer using equipment,\n\n567\n00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:14.380\nthat disposal phase disposing equipment,\nthere's different ways to do it.\n\n568\n00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:18.280\nYou might be selling it, because you can\nrecoup some of your costs that way or\n\n569\n00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.120\nyou might have to destroy it.\n\n570\n00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:24.470\nCheck out our proper storage disposal,\nour data disposal episode as part of this\n\n571\n00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.570\nseries where I talk about\nthat with hard drives.\n\n572\n00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.720\nAnd some of the things you might\nhave to do as part of that.\n\n573\n00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.470\nThat's part of your lifecycle too.\n\n574\n00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:33.770\nAnd that usually goes into a documentation\nsection which we haven't really\n\n575\n00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:34.860\ntouched on here.\n\n576\n00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.780\nAnd now I do wanna talk a little\nbit more about asset history, and\n\n577\n00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:38.980\nin ticket history and stuff.\n\n578\n00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.520\nSo we'll get a chance to\nsee those in part two.\n\n579\n00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.620\n&gt;&gt; All right, well we look forward\nto seeing you in part two and\n\n580\n00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.090\nwe look forward to seeing\nyou the viewer in part two.\n\n581\n00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:47.220\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign out here.\n\n582\n00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.000\nFor ITPro.TV,\nI've been you host Wes Bryan.\n\n583\n00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.630\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Part Two Pezet.\n\n584\n00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:52.361\n&gt;&gt; All right [LAUGH].\n\n585\n00:27:52.361 --> 00:28:00.720\nWe'll see you next time.\n[MUSIC]\n\n586\n00:28:00.720 -->

00:00:11.608\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.608 --> 00:00:14.908\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.908 --> 00:00:16.340\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.091\nAnd in today's episode we\nare continuing through\n\n7\n00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:21.914\nour CompTIA Server+ SK0004 Certification.\n\n8\n00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:25.658\nAnd well, we're actually coming back\nwith a part two cuz I had to cut him off\n\n9\n00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:28.170\nin mid-sentence cuz he\nwas talking way too much.\n\n10\n00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.180\nWe're coming back with a part two on\nasset management and documentation.\n\n11\n00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.660\nJoining us in the studios for\nthis endeavour is none other than Mr.\n\n12\n00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.300\nDon Pezet.\n\n13\n00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.390\nDon how you're doing sir?\n\n14\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.430\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing just well, Les.\n\n15\n00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.860\nIn the last episode we really focused on\nasset management more than documentation.\n\n16\n00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.240\nAlthough, I did say asset management\nis part of documentation.\n\n17\n00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.840\nSo, it's really kind of\npart of that umbrella.\n\n18\n00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.440\nIn this episode, I want to talk about some\nof the other types of documentation that\n\n19\n00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.570\nwe need to be performing on our\nnetwork and keeping a record of at\n\n20\n00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.050\nany given time to make sure that\neverything is on the up and up.\n\n21\n00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.880\nIt's really kind of\nan important thing to do.\n\n22\n00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.260\nSo, What we were looking at in\nthe last episode was tracking\n\n23\n00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.530\nthe assets that we have and\nwhether they're under warranty and\n\n24\n00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.970\nwhat their serial numbers are and\nall that.\n\n25\n00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.920\nBut once the asset is logged in it's\ngoing through it's life cycle, right.\n\n26\n00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.880\nWe've purchased it, we've deployed it,\nit's now in production.\n\n27\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.060\nAnd we need to track what\nhappens to it over time.\n\n28\n00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.370\nAnd that needs to be documented too.\n\n29\n00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.860\nAnd I'm gonna go back into\nthe Solar Winds Web Help Desk,\n\n30\n00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.990\nthe software that I was\nusing in the last episode.\n\n31\n00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.560\nAnd we had looked at asset basics and\nasset details.\n\n32\n00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.230\nBut you'll notice the next two tabs here,\nasset history and ticket history.\n\n33\n00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.210\nAnd when I go into something like\nthe asset history, we can start to look at\n\n34\n00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.530\nthings that have changed on that as\nfar as for example, warranty renewals.\n\n35\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.190\nI might have renewed this\na few times over the years.\n\n36\n00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.827\nIf it's an older server it might have been\npurchased with a three year warranty, and\n\n37\n00:01:49.827 --> 00:01:52.046\nthen as we got closer to the three years,\n\n38\n00:01:52.046 --> 00:01:54.550\nwe decided to extend it\nout to the five year.\n\n39\n00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.490\nAnd so that's a change in the asset.\n\n40\n00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.005\nAnd so you'll see some different things\nin here, I haven't updated this one.\n\n41\n00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:00.020\nSo these are just synchronized.\n\n42\n00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.010\nSee how I was saying\nsynchronize by import?\n\n43\n00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.280\nThey imported this from some other\nkind of spreadsheet system, or\n\n44\n00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.380\nother technology that was in place.\n\n45\n00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.770\nBut ticket history is\nprobably the most valuable.\n\n46\n00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.270\nIs that as tickets get\nlogged into the system,\n\n47\n00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.340\nsomebody has a problem,\nthere's a record of it right here.\n\n48\n00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.390\nAnd I can start to see what's been\nhappening with that system, and\n\n49\n00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.180\nis there a consistent pattern of failure?\n\n50\n00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.760\nBecause I've spotted that before\nusing asset systems like this.\n\n51\n00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.310\nFor example, we had a fiber optic\nline that went down once, and\n\n52\n00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.480\nit went down for a period of two hours.\n\n53\n00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.530\nAnd it was just kind of\none of those weird things.\n\n54\n00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.960\nWe called up the service provider,\nand they found a switch\n\n55\n00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.140\nport that had locked up, and they had\nreset that port and everything was fine.\n\n56\n00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.660\nWell two months later, it happened again.\n\n57\n00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.750\nAnd two months after that,\nit happened again.\n\n58\n00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.840\nNow it was far enough apart, right,\n\n59\n00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.920\n60 days apart that I might not\nhave picked up on a pattern.\n\n60\n00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.030\nBut when I was looking at\nthe tickets logged in the system,\n\n61\n00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.200\nI could see them on\nthe exact same interval.\n\n62\n00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.290\n60 days apart.\n\n63\n00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.840\nThese three occurrences.\n\n64\n00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.390\nAnd so I was able to pick up a pattern,\nand then we were able to identify that\n\n65\n00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.630\nswitch port was locking up\nbecause of a memory leak.\n\n66\n00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.410\nAnd it was taking 60 days for\nthe memory buffers to fill, and then lock.\n\n67\n00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.350\nAnd a reset would fix it,\nfor 60 more days.\n\n68\n00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.000\nAnd so being able to spot that kind of a\npattern is able to be done when you've got\n\n69\n00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.420\na ticket history that\nyou can track like that.\n\n70\n00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.550\nSo a lot of people fixate on tickets\nAs far as what's going on right now.\n\n71\n00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.560\nHere's all of the open\ntickets on my system.\n\n72\n00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.170\nBut historical tickets\nare just as valuable.\n\n73\n00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.180\nThat you can go back and\nestablish patterns.\n\n74\n00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.920\nAll right, so that's one\nadvantage of having documentation.\n\n75\n00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.720\nThe other advantage is,\ndepending on the type of documentation,\n\n76\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.730\nit can really get you out of\na bind in a lot of scenarios.\n\n77\n00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.630\nFor example you call in to a company\nbecause you had a hardware failure.\n\n78\n00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.510\nAnd they tell you the unit's\nnot under warranty.\n\n79\n00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.570\nSorry it's not under warranty.\n\n80\n00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.140\nAnd you say, well actually we\npurchased the extended service plan.\n\n81\n00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.040\nAnd they say no, no you didn't.\n\n82\n00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.390\nWell if I've got an asset management\nsystem in place with good documentation,\n\n83\n00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.660\nI can go and I can pull the purchase or I\ncan pull the invoice and I can show that.\n\n84\n00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.950\nI can say here it is here's my receipt.\n\n85\n00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:04.570\nHave you ever had that?\n\n86\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.310\nSomething breaks, you wanna return it,\nand you didn't save the receipt?\n\n87\n00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.650\nWell, with this stuff, you gotta\nsave your receipt, it's important.\n\n88\n00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.790\nThese are high ticket items.\n\n89\n00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.490\nIt's not usually gonna be an issue.\n\n90\n00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.270\nSo let's run down the list of\nCompTia approved documentation.\n\n91\n00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.620\nAnd some of this is\ndocumentation that we make,\n\n92\n00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.130\nsome of it is documentation that other\npeople make, and we just gather it, right?\n\n93\n00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.770\nAnd the first example CompTia gives us,\nis service manuals.\n\n94\n00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.390\nWhen you purchase a server\nfrom really anybody.\n\n95\n00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.390\nSo I were to go to,\nwe'll use Dell as our example.\n\n96\n00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.920\nIf I were to go to Dell and\nI was to buy a server from them, well,\n\n97\n00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.270\nwhen you buy a server you\ncan go to the support page.\n\n98\n00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.500\nActually let me jump straight to support.\n\n99\n00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.760\nAnd when you go into support you're gonna\nsee a lot of things like drivers and\n\n100\n00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.320\nfirmware and so on.\n\n101\n00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.900\nBut there's also supporting documentation\nin here for maintenance, for proper\n\n102\n00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.445\ninstallation, for really anything you can\nthink about, environmental scenarios.\n\n103\n00:05:02.445 --> 00:05:03.225\nThat's really important.\n\n104\n00:05:03.225 --> 00:05:04.145\nThe environmental guides for\n\n105\n00:05:04.145 --> 00:05:08.505\nmost servers will tell you their bottom\nand high end temperature thresholds so\n\n106\n00:05:08.505 --> 00:05:11.765\nyou can set the temperatures in your\nserver rooms to be appropriate.\n\n107\n00:05:11.765 --> 00:05:13.035\nSo when we start going through and\n\n108\n00:05:13.035 --> 00:05:15.655\nlooking at this,\nthis is documentation that Dell has made.\n\n109\n00:05:15.655 --> 00:05:17.755\nI don't have to make it,\nthey've already made it.\n\n110\n00:05:17.755 --> 00:05:21.750\nBut I have to know where to go to get it\nand if I know to go to Dell's website it.\n\n111\n00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.890\nAnd you guys see me clicking here.\n\n112\n00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.490\nIt's gonna take me a handful of clicks to\nbe able to get to what I actually want,\n\n113\n00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.860\nthe power edge servers.\n\n114\n00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.130\nAnd I'll pull up a particular\nserver like a A20.\n\n115\n00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.910\nSo we'll pull this one up,\nthat when I go in here and find it,\n\n116\n00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.660\nthere might be more than one\ndifferent version of M820s.\n\n117\n00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.910\nHPE for\nthe longest time had the ProLiant 360s.\n\n118\n00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.350\nAnd there were like seven\ndifferent generations, or\n\n119\n00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.990\neight different generations of the 360s.\n\n120\n00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.890\nSo just because you knew it was an ML360\nyou didn't necessarily know which\n\n121\n00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.090\none it was.\n\n122\n00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.940\nSo I can could get the appropriate\ndocumentation, take it and\n\n123\n00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.120\nlog it into my documentation system.\n\n124\n00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.290\nAnd so now when I wanna pull\nup the service manual for\n\n125\n00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.130\na particular server I can find it.\n\n126\n00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.639\nIf a hard drive goes bad and\nI wanna replace it, is it hot swapable or\n\n127\n00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.750\ndo I have to turn the server off?\n\n128\n00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:11.720\nI don't know.\n\n129\n00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.300\nWell let me go to the service manual.\n\n130\n00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.830\nAnd in the service manual it will tell\nyou, all right, these are hot swap drives.\n\n131\n00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.660\nYou can pop them out and\npop them in whenever you want.\n\n132\n00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.730\nA lot of them will even go\ninto detailed procedures.\n\n133\n00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.240\nHere's how you go about doing it and\nmaking sure the rebuild happens.\n\n134\n00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.750\nAnd so that's important stuff.\n\n135\n00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.930\nThese service manuals, and they're\navailable for pretty much anything.\n\n136\n00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.340\nBut here's the Dell power edge\nM820 system owners manual.\n\n137\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.690\nIt's a PDF.\n\n138\n00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.658\nNow my asset management software\nmight not be designed to store a PDF.\n\n139\n00:06:36.658 --> 00:06:40.340\nSo I might need to set up a file share\nsomewhere, where I can place these.\n\n140\n00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.200\nSomething that has consistent structure,\nso\n\n141\n00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.030\nthat I can easily and quickly find\nthis information and get to it.\n\n142\n00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.100\nSo, web page is running a little on\nthe slow side today but here we go.\n\n143\n00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.330\nSo here is, I can get in here and\nI can pull up Using The System Setup And\n\n144\n00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.320\nBoot Manager, System Setup Options.\n\n145\n00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.400\nThis is explaining all the BIOS\noptions in the system.\n\n146\n00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.140\nAnd then we can start looking\nat installing blade components,\n\n147\n00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.330\ncuz it's a blade chassee that I picked.\n\n148\n00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.800\nRiser cards, flash cards,\nprocessors, and so on.\n\n149\n00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.410\nAll the information that we can\nwanna know about that server\n\n150\n00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.620\nright here in the service manual.\n\n151\n00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.860\nYou just have to go and find it.\n\n152\n00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.560\nWell, if you're in a hurry, if you're in a\npanic trying to find some information out\n\n153\n00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.510\nas fast as you can, you don't wanna have\nto go to the website and dig around.\n\n154\n00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.860\nYou wanna already have those manuals\nright where you can get to them.\n\n155\n00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.519\nAnd that's a big part of documentation\nis just gathering this stuff together.\n\n156\n00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.940\nAnd the next example is a network diagram.\n\n157\n00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.860\nNetwork diagrams are tough because\nnetworks can be really challenging\n\n158\n00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.040\nto document, to show how they're\nconstructed and built and so on.\n\n159\n00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.180\nBut the other thing is that networks\nchange, and they change frequently.\n\n160\n00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.440\nSo network documentation is something\nwe're having to update a lot, right?\n\n161\n00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.131\nThe BIOS settings in a server\nare likely not going to change for\n\n162\n00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:50.442\nthe lifetime of that server.\n\n163\n00:07:50.442 --> 00:07:54.129\nSo if I'm gonna run a server for five\nyears, I get the documentation on day one\n\n164\n00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:56.991\nand it's probably the same on\nthe end of the five year term.\n\n165\n00:07:56.991 --> 00:07:59.893\nBut my network is getting reconfigured.\n\n166\n00:07:59.893 --> 00:08:03.760\nSo with networks, we typically do\ndiagrams, and you can use software.\n\n167\n00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.870\nMicrosoft Visio is very popular\nsoftware for doing network diagramming.\n\n168\n00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.810\nI use several different programs.\n\n169\n00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.785\nHere, on this show, you've probably\nseen us use this program SimpleDiagrams.\n\n170\n00:08:12.785 --> 00:08:15.640\nSimpleDiagrams is like\na very easy to use Visio.\n\n171\n00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.880\nWith Visio you spend a ton of time\nfiguring out how to do things.\n\n172\n00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.740\nBut once you get really good with Visio,\nit's actually pretty awesome.\n\n173\n00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.860\nAnd for network diagrams,\nyou can do a great job.\n\n174\n00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.130\nBut a network diagram doesn't have\nto be anything crazy and complex.\n\n175\n00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.500\nYou're gonna be documenting stuff like\nif you've got routers in your system.\n\n176\n00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.372\nAnd so, you can drop a nice\nlittle icon for your router, and\n\n177\n00:08:34.372 --> 00:08:36.169\nstick that out there on the diagram.\n\n178\n00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:40.410\nAnd then, if your router is connected to\nthe Internet, you can symbolize that.\n\n179\n00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:42.000\nAnd kinda drop it out here.\n\n180\n00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.510\nWe can say we've got a firewall,\nand throw that out here.\n\n181\n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:49.250\nAnd by creating a diagram like this,\npeople can look at it and\n\n182\n00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.010\neasily understand what they're looking at.\n\n183\n00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.270\nNow, you'll likely need to\nconnect all this stuff together.\n\n184\n00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.980\nSo when you create diagrams,\n\n185\n00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.660\nyou're typically going to be doing\nline diagrams where you come in and\n\n186\n00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.960\nconnect these devices to each\nother to get these things linked.\n\n187\n00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.720\nAnd then, that way, as we look at\nthe diagrams later on, we'll be able to\n\n188\n00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.790\nunderstand the relationship\nbetween these different items.\n\n189\n00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.570\nAnd how they all work together, so\nI'm just gonna kinda connect these.\n\n190\n00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.510\nMost of them, I think I got it there,\nnope, I missed.\n\n191\n00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.428\nWhen I click on an item,\nsee all these little boxes that appear?\n\n192\n00:09:23.428 --> 00:09:29.455\nYou'll see Xs, and these are connection\npoints where I can link the line.\n\n193\n00:09:29.455 --> 00:09:32.367\nAnd the nice part about it is\nif I link the line, later on,\n\n194\n00:09:32.367 --> 00:09:34.815\nI can move a device and\nsee how it moves the line.\n\n195\n00:09:34.815 --> 00:09:38.926\nCuz what you're gonna find is as you add\nmore and more devices, the pictures start\n\n196\n00:09:38.926 --> 00:09:42.895\nto get cluttered, and you're like,\nwell, let me move this around.\n\n197\n00:09:42.895 --> 00:09:47.350\nAnd if I didn't connect the line\nto those little anchor points,\n\n198\n00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.010\nthen it's not gonna work out very well for\nme.\n\n199\n00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.650\nI just broke this line in half, great.\n\n200\n00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.800\nNo, that's not what I wanted but\n\n201\n00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.600\nhey, just another thing that you can\ndo when you create these curved lines.\n\n202\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.600\nSome people like curved lines.\n\n203\n00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.710\nI'll do that.\n\n204\n00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.660\nThis is gonna turn into a Bob Ross\nhappiness and painting it.\n\n205\n00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.840\nSo if I go too far.\n\n206\n00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.630\nBut really,\nthe sky's the limits with this stuff.\n\n207\n00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.520\nYou make the diagram the way\nyou need it to be and\n\n208\n00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.740\nthe customizations\nare really just up to you.\n\n209\n00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.500\n&gt;&gt; And you said it's challenging and\nwe can kinda see that right here,\n\n210\n00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.870\nas you're struggling with\nthis diagram right now.\n\n211\n00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:21.450\nBut you said it's also very important,\nin fact, I have to share this.\n\n212\n00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.790\nWe actually had something go\nlike on our network this morning\n\n213\n00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.910\nwhere you were referencing\nthe documentation when it comes to\n\n214\n00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.770\na certain component within our video\nproduction not getting past the router.\n\n215\n00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.040\nAnd you said, according to\nthe diagram that I read this morning,\n\n216\n00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.950\nso challenging and\ndifficult maybe to put together.\n\n217\n00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:42.030\nAnd then, to keep up to date with the\ndynamic changing of our networks, Don, but\n\n218\n00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.660\nwhat's the importance of\nnetwork documentation or\n\n219\n00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.310\ndiagrammatic representation?\n\n220\n00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.269\nOther devices that you\nhave on your network.\n\n221\n00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:50.912\n&gt;&gt; Well, it helps with flow and\n\n222\n00:10:50.912 --> 00:10:54.549\nactually CompTIA calls out what\nthey call a data flow diagram.\n\n223\n00:10:54.549 --> 00:10:58.377\nAnd a data flow diagram is where we need\nto understand how data is moving through\n\n224\n00:10:58.377 --> 00:11:01.570\nour network because things can\nget really confusing sometimes.\n\n225\n00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:05.360\nWe can lose track, where I might\nhave somebody call in and say, hey,\n\n226\n00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.190\nI can't get to your website.\n\n227\n00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.843\nAnd as I'm working on my diagram here, you\nguys see where I can probably spend all\n\n228\n00:11:11.843 --> 00:11:14.717\nday kinda just working on\none of these diagrams but\n\n229\n00:11:14.717 --> 00:11:19.440\nas I'm working on the diagram I'm creating\na layout that matches what I've got,\n\n230\n00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.780\nwhat I've got might actually\nbe really be complex.\n\n231\n00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.570\nAs I pass through a firewall,\nI might move into a switch, and\n\n232\n00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:30.360\nthen from the switch, I might have\nseveral servers stuck behind there.\n\n233\n00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.180\nSo as I come in here and\nstart to lay out servers and\n\n234\n00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.780\nmaybe these servers are in\na load balancing farm and\n\n235\n00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:41.630\nso when we lay these out, they really\nstart to kinda branch out like this.\n\n236\n00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.400\nAnd when people are connecting,\n\n237\n00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.520\nthey can be connecting through any\none of these different servers, well,\n\n238\n00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.720\nI need to understand how the data\nflows and through which devices.\n\n239\n00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.490\nThe more complex my network is, the more\npathways there'll be through that network.\n\n240\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.880\nSo when somebody calls this and says, hey,\n\n241\n00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.110\nI can't get to your website,\nI can pull up a diagram like this and\n\n242\n00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:04.590\nI can say, well, what is in-between\nthat user and the website?\n\n243\n00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.271\nAnd we can work out that flow.\n\n244\n00:12:06.271 --> 00:12:07.470\nThey're coming from the Internet.\n\n245\n00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.830\nAnd they're gonna pass through Router 1.\n\n246\n00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.650\nThey're gonna pass through Firewall 1, or\nwhatever it's called, pass through Switch\n\n247\n00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.740\n1, and then they're gonna get load\nbalanced across these different servers.\n\n248\n00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.860\nAnd by having a graphical representation\nlike this, we can follow that flow and\n\n249\n00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.710\nsee all the devices that are in that path.\n\n250\n00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:24.760\nAnd get an idea.\n\n251\n00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.010\nAnd if we've extended the documention to\ninclude things like device numbers and\n\n252\n00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.280\nIP address and so on,\nthat can be really handy.\n\n253\n00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.520\nWhere it starts to get tricky, are devices\nthat have more than one interface.\n\n254\n00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.065\nBecause if you think about the flow\nthrough a router, if I asked the user,\n\n255\n00:12:38.065 --> 00:12:41.860\nhey, can you ping the public\ninterface of my firewall?\n\n256\n00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:42.550\nYes.\n\n257\n00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.920\nCan you ping the internal\ninterface of my firewall?\n\n258\n00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.460\nNo.\n\n259\n00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.000\nWell, that might be a breakpoint or\nyou do the same thing on the router.\n\n260\n00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.960\nSo as we start to do this documentation,\nunderstand that you might need to\n\n261\n00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.490\nadd things to it like arrows\nthat show direction of traffic.\n\n262\n00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:02.240\nYou might need to add coloring,\njust to be able to tell things apart.\n\n263\n00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.988\nAnd when you start adding things like\ninterfaces and their information,\n\n264\n00:13:05.988 --> 00:13:08.714\nyou might need to do what\nare called call-out boxes.\n\n265\n00:13:08.714 --> 00:13:13.544\nAnd call-out boxes let you identify\nwhether something is tied to one\n\n266\n00:13:13.544 --> 00:13:16.720\nparticular interface or another.\n\n267\n00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.370\nBecause I might have different\nconfigurations on different interfaces and\n\n268\n00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.140\nwe can identify that by\nusing call out boxes.\n\n269\n00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.930\nAgain, just helping to\nfigure out your flow.\n\n270\n00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.740\nBut what's gonna happen here?\n\n271\n00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:33.130\nWell, over time, maybe I have a server\nfail, this server fails, and I replace it.\n\n272\n00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.370\nWell, when I replace this server, I might\nupdate my asset documentation and so\n\n273\n00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.490\non, but I've gotta remember to\ncome to my network diagram and\n\n274\n00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.880\nupdate the information here, too,\nto reflect that same change.\n\n275\n00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.280\nBut software like this is\ndesigned to make it easy.\n\n276\n00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.120\nThat you can map out your network,\nlay it out like this and now when you have\n\n277\n00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.670\na problem you can pull these diagrams\nup and you can look at them.\n\n278\n00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.130\nVizio, very powerful,\n\n279\n00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:57.650\nprobably the number one network\ndiagramming software that's out there.\n\n280\n00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:01.080\nThere's software like this one, simple\ndiagrams, I love it just cuz it's simple.\n\n281\n00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.318\nThere's Why Ad,\nis the one that you use, right, Wes?\n\n282\n00:14:03.318 --> 00:14:05.190\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; And that ones open source and free,\n\n283\n00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.050\nyou can go and download it.\n\n284\n00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.770\nDo you know the website?\n\n285\n00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:07.405\nIs it whyad.org?\n\n286\n00:14:07.405 --> 00:14:09.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's whyad.org,\nthat's absolutely correct.\n\n287\n00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.890\n&gt;&gt; So\ndefinitely you want to check out there.\n\n288\n00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.840\nBut then there's some\nreally advanced ones.\n\n289\n00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.390\nLike solar winds has some software\nthat will scan your network.\n\n290\n00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.580\nFind the devices and draw the map for you.\n\n291\n00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.390\nNow, it doesn't know how to arrange it\nto make it all pretty like this, so\n\n292\n00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.770\nit arranges it in a big circle.\n\n293\n00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.980\nBut it can map it out and lay it out.\n\n294\n00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.560\nAnd you see all the interactions and\nthe way that that's connected.\n\n295\n00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.640\nThe SolarWinds Network Performance\nmonitor can do that.\n\n296\n00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.050\nIt's a great product, very expensive,\nbut it is a great product.\n\n297\n00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:39.140\nAnd it does it just right there,\nthey're very, very powerful stuff.\n\n298\n00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.794\nBut the key trick here is\nkeeping this stuff up to date.\n\n299\n00:14:41.794 --> 00:14:45.371\nAs you make changes in the network,\nyou need to update your documents,\n\n300\n00:14:45.371 --> 00:14:47.110\nyour diagrams, to reflect that.\n\n301\n00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:51.310\n&gt;&gt; Don, we had a member in the chat room\nthat had mentioned that these diagrams\n\n302\n00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.440\nalso help when you have\na change of personnel.\n\n303\n00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.490\nYou got one person coming out, one person\ncoming in and taking over a position.\n\n304\n00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:01.110\nNow, you have told me a story before\nat one point where you had to\n\n305\n00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.380\nthoroughly document what your job was-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n306\n00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.200\n&gt;&gt; Just in case, well, maybe you got\n\n307\n00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.600\nthe ax, or maybe they brought somebody\nelse in there and you moved up the ladder.\n\n308\n00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I worked for a bank,\nit was APTIC insured.\n\n309\n00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:16.320\nAnd as part of that insurance we had to\nshow that the bank could continue to do\n\n310\n00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.610\nbusiness even though we had\na total loss of personnel.\n\n311\n00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.650\nAnd so, everything that I\ndid had to be documented so\n\n312\n00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:25.690\nthat if, we would always say,\nif I get hit by a bus, but it\n\n313\n00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.650\nwas really if there was an earthquake and\nthe building was destroyed or whatever.\n\n314\n00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.180\nHow can the business continue on?\n\n315\n00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.920\nSo I had to document everything\nthat I did, how it was done and\n\n316\n00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.000\nhow that procedure worked.\n\n317\n00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.200\nVery time consuming.\n\n318\n00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.313\nEasily half of my time was consumed in\ndocumentation, but it's important for\n\n319\n00:15:40.313 --> 00:15:43.195\nthe stability of the organization\nthat you have that.\n\n320\n00:15:43.195 --> 00:15:45.877\nOther types of diagrams and\ndocuments we might have, architecture or\n\n321\n00:15:45.877 --> 00:15:46.972\ninfrastructure diagrams.\n\n322\n00:15:46.972 --> 00:15:50.723\nIf you have a building like I\nused to work at a skyscraper, so\n\n323\n00:15:50.723 --> 00:15:54.484\nwe had offices on five different\nfloors in the skyscraper.\n\n324\n00:15:54.484 --> 00:15:57.003\nAnd so how's that all interconnected,\nright?\n\n325\n00:15:57.003 --> 00:16:00.390\nIf I'm on the fourth,\nit would have been like the 21st floor.\n\n326\n00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:01.927\nIf I'm on the 21st floor,\n\n327\n00:16:01.927 --> 00:16:05.010\nhow is my data making it down\nto the 17th floor and so on.\n\n328\n00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:09.073\nSo how we coordinate that and how that\ninformation flows, cuz a lot of times\n\n329\n00:16:09.073 --> 00:16:13.470\nyou don't have access to the common\ntunnels that pass between the floors.\n\n330\n00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.290\nYou end up having to go through\nthe building facilities,\n\n331\n00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.770\nthe building supervisor and\nall that to actually get the cabling run.\n\n332\n00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.030\nSo how does that work?\n\n333\n00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.420\nGotta make sure we have that documented.\n\n334\n00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.960\nRecovery documentation, which is kind\nof what Wes was talking about there.\n\n335\n00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.100\nIf we have a device or system fail,\nwhat are the steps to recover?\n\n336\n00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.292\nAnd we did an episode where we\ntalked about business resumption and\n\n337\n00:16:34.292 --> 00:16:35.780\ndisaster recovery planning.\n\n338\n00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.628\nAnd that's what this is all about is\nhey If I have a total server failure,\n\n339\n00:16:39.628 --> 00:16:43.601\nhow can I stand up a new server that takes\nover that role in as minimal a time as\n\n340\n00:16:43.601 --> 00:16:44.250\npossible?\n\n341\n00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.600\nAnd that can be quite a bit.\n\n342\n00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.774\nBaseline documentation,\n\n343\n00:16:47.774 --> 00:16:50.620\nwe talked about that way back\nin the server setup episodes.\n\n344\n00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.580\nWhen you bring up a brand new server, you\nneed to take a performance baseline of it.\n\n345\n00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.822\nAnd that performance baseline is showing\nhow that server runs on a normal day\n\n346\n00:16:58.822 --> 00:17:00.900\nwhen things are working right.\n\n347\n00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.870\nWhen you first stand that server up,\nhow much CPU utilization does it have?\n\n348\n00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:07.240\nWhat's it's disk IO look like in the IOPS?\n\n349\n00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.920\nWhat's the network bandwidth?\n\n350\n00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.720\nWhat is the RAM consumption?\n\n351\n00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.274\nAnd that way, six months later, or\na year later, when people call in and\n\n352\n00:17:15.274 --> 00:17:18.359\nsay that server's so slow,\nI hate it Is it actually slow, or\n\n353\n00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:21.240\ndo people just feel that way\ncuz the times change, right?\n\n354\n00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.230\nSo we can pull our documentation on that\nperformance baseline and compare it.\n\n355\n00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:29.869\nSo, that's something that's created way\nearly in the lifecycle, but it goes into\n\n356\n00:17:29.869 --> 00:17:33.870\ndocumentation and it stays there so\nthat we've got it available for us.\n\n357\n00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:38.350\nChange management policies, we could\nan entire series on change management.\n\n358\n00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.020\nWhen you deploy a server,\nyou deploy it a certain way.\n\n359\n00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.248\nAnd you may have gone all out and\n\n360\n00:17:43.248 --> 00:17:47.280\nmade sure that it was properly\nconfigured and secured.\n\n361\n00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.160\nYou hardened it.\n\n362\n00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:53.010\nYou updated all of the firmware,\nall of the drivers.\n\n363\n00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.300\nIt was in great shape\nwhen you deployed it.\n\n364\n00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:00.920\nAnd then over the next six months,\nother people did the same thing.\n\n365\n00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.020\nThey updated the firm ware,\nthey updated the drivers.\n\n366\n00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.780\nThey kept doing that to make\nsure it was in tip top shape.\n\n367\n00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.660\nWell, then the software breaks one day and\nnobody knows why.\n\n368\n00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.320\nHey, my server's not working anymore.\n\n369\n00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.580\nWhat's going on?\n\n370\n00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.240\nWell, you've got six months of changes\nthat people have been making and\n\n371\n00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.990\nyou don't know what's going on.\n\n372\n00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.910\nWhich one of those changes\ncaused the problem?\n\n373\n00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.160\nWe don't know.\n\n374\n00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.800\nAnd there could be unintentional\nchanges that are made.\n\n375\n00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.541\nSomebody just goes in and\n\n376\n00:18:25.541 --> 00:18:28.230\nit's like you know what I'm gonna make\nthis change it'll make this run faster.\n\n377\n00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.940\nAnd it breaks something else.\n\n378\n00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.610\nWe need a way to track that.\n\n379\n00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.960\nChange management is technically it's\njust another word for bureaucracy.\n\n380\n00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.250\nIt puts a lot of bureaucracy in\nbetween you and doing your work.\n\n381\n00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.550\nBut there's a reason for it, right?\n\n382\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.320\nLet me just give you,\nI'll give you a great story.\n\n383\n00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.020\nI used to work with a guy,\na phenomenal guy, very, very smart.\n\n384\n00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.610\nWorked very, very hard.\n\n385\n00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:52.542\nAnd you always knew when he was going on\na vacation because he would take a week in\n\n386\n00:18:52.542 --> 00:18:55.770\nvacation but the week prior\nhe would work twice as hard.\n\n387\n00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:59.370\nHe would do extra work to try and\nget more done for when he was gone.\n\n388\n00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.470\nHe was a great guy,\nreally dedicated to the company.\n\n389\n00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.160\nThe problem was,\nhe didn't document anything.\n\n390\n00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.740\nIt was super annoying.\n\n391\n00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:08.610\nAnd so he would do a ton of work,\nand then go on vacation.\n\n392\n00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:13.070\nAnd so Monday morning, I'd come in and\nall hell was breaking loose.\n\n393\n00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.633\nThe servers are messing up,\nusers are calling in complaining and\n\n394\n00:19:15.633 --> 00:19:17.180\nall sorts of crazy things are going on.\n\n395\n00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.490\nAnd I would go what did Bill do?\n\n396\n00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.545\nAnd then you gotta try and\nfigure it out and\n\n397\n00:19:21.545 --> 00:19:25.140\nwhat the heck did he do over that last\nweek and I gotta reinvent the wheel.\n\n398\n00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.293\nWell, if it was all documented,\nthen you say okay,\n\n399\n00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:31.170\nhere's exactly what he\ndid over the last week.\n\n400\n00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.600\nI know what he changed,\nI can roll it back,\n\n401\n00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.840\nI can undue the changes that were made.\n\n402\n00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.280\nChange management is super important.\n\n403\n00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.979\nThe key thing about change management\nis that you document the change, right,\n\n404\n00:19:42.979 --> 00:19:44.580\nespecially so then people can do it.\n\n405\n00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.340\nBut there’s more to it than\njust documenting the change.\n\n406\n00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.400\nThere’s usually an approval process.\n\n407\n00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.690\nWe need to approve the change.\n\n408\n00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.390\nWhy are you changing that server?\n\n409\n00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:58.230\nWes might be working on a server and he\ncan't connect to a database that’s on it.\n\n410\n00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.120\nAnd so he says, you know what?\n\n411\n00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.160\nI'm gonna disable the Windows Firewall.\n\n412\n00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.350\nI bet it's a Windows Firewall problem.\n\n413\n00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:03.680\nLet me just turn that off.\n\n414\n00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.100\nOkay well, now he can connect to\nthe database, problem solved, right?\n\n415\n00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.440\nWell, he weakened\nthe security on the server.\n\n416\n00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.920\nTurning off the firewall\nwasn't the right solution.\n\n417\n00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.300\nOpening a port on the firewall was.\n\n418\n00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.820\nBut that's not what he did.\n\n419\n00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:19.900\nBut if he was a junior admin and\ndidn't know that, what was to stop him?\n\n420\n00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.500\nIf change management was in place,\nthat would have stopped it.\n\n421\n00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.409\nIf you make a change to the server\nwithout going through change management,\n\n422\n00:20:26.409 --> 00:20:27.050\nyou're fired.\n\n423\n00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:28.780\nSo, there's your motivation to do it.\n\n424\n00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:32.530\nSo, then he fills out a form and he says,\nI want to turn off the Windows firewall.\n\n425\n00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:33.420\nThat's what I'm going to do.\n\n426\n00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.275\nI want to do it on this day,\nat this time and\n\n427\n00:20:35.275 --> 00:20:37.600\nit's not going to impact the end users.\n\n428\n00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.050\nAnd then he puts his business case.\n\n429\n00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:43.580\nI'm doing this cuz I can't connect to\nthe database with the Windows Firewall on.\n\n430\n00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.120\nAnd then he submits it to\nthe change advisory board, the CAB.\n\n431\n00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.730\nOr you might have a change committee or\nany number of names.\n\n432\n00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:51.540\nMost people call it a CAB,\na change advisory board.\n\n433\n00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:55.698\nAnd the change advisory board is made\nup of the CIO and other experts,\n\n434\n00:20:55.698 --> 00:20:57.430\nand they review the change.\n\n435\n00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.826\nAnd they look at it and they say, Wes,\nDon't turn off the windows firewall,\n\n436\n00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:02.140\njust open up the little port.\n\n437\n00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.120\nI see this in the Linux world\nall the time with SELinux.\n\n438\n00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.020\nSo many people are like,\nI'm going to disable SELinux.\n\n439\n00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.820\nAnd I say, you can do that if you\ndon't want to work here anymore.\n\n440\n00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.597\nOr you can figure out the right\ncontext type to assign and\n\n441\n00:21:13.597 --> 00:21:15.870\nyou can get SC Linux to work for you.\n\n442\n00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:17.170\nThat's how it's supposed to work.\n\n443\n00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:21.330\nSo, by looking at it and evaluating it,\nthe change advisory board can reject\n\n444\n00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:25.300\nthe change if it's not right, or\nthey can allow the change to go through.\n\n445\n00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:25.970\nThey can approve it.\n\n446\n00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.520\nAnd if they approve it,\nWes makes the change.\n\n447\n00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.380\nWell now, everything is great,\nsunshine and rainbows.\n\n448\n00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:32.680\nEverything works perfect.\n\n449\n00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.016\nWhen things don't work,\nand in the change ticket,\n\n450\n00:21:35.016 --> 00:21:38.370\nWes put here’s how I'll monitor it to\nmake sure the change is successful.\n\n451\n00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:42.900\nAnd if the change wasn't successful\nhere's how I'll undo the change right.\n\n452\n00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.877\nBy having all that documented,\nyou now know what to watch for and\n\n453\n00:21:45.877 --> 00:21:48.870\nyou know how to undo it in the event\nthings don't work out right.\n\n454\n00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.022\nIt makes things so much better, so\n\n455\n00:21:51.022 --> 00:21:54.300\nmuch easier when you have\nmore than one admin right.\n\n456\n00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.830\nIf you just have one admin, you probably\ndon't need change management, but\n\n457\n00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.239\nif you have two or five or 50 or\n\n458\n00:21:59.239 --> 00:22:02.310\n500 A lot of people are gonna be\nstepping on each other's toes.\n\n459\n00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.660\nAnd you've got to have change management.\n\n460\n00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.701\nA lot of software,\nlike the Solar Winds Web Help Desk,\n\n461\n00:22:07.701 --> 00:22:11.590\nthat I was showing earlier,\nit's got change management built into it.\n\n462\n00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.110\nIn fact, you can see, here.\n\n463\n00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.760\nI'm looking at my tickets, and\nmost of these are support tickets.\n\n464\n00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.530\nPeople have a problem.\n\n465\n00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:17.830\nHere's a password reset.\n\n466\n00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.180\nI need to reset a password.\n\n467\n00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.370\nBut if you look in this next one,\nyou'll see a schedule change for\n\n468\n00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:23.530\npostponing a release.\n\n469\n00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:24.870\nThey're pushing something back two weeks,\nright?\n\n470\n00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.950\nHere's a request for\nchange that required approval.\n\n471\n00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:31.958\nAnd I can look over here and I can see\nwhere one person's already approved it,\n\n472\n00:22:31.958 --> 00:22:34.940\nbut it's still waiting for\nthe board to approve.\n\n473\n00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.280\nAnd I can go in, and\nI can view it as a change request.\n\n474\n00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.650\nTo see if somebody submitted\nthat change request right here.\n\n475\n00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:44.903\nAnd when you look at that ticket, you'll\nbe able to see what is they're requesting,\n\n476\n00:22:44.903 --> 00:22:46.930\nand what it is they want to do, and so on.\n\n477\n00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.984\nThis is a schedule change,\nit's going through a normal process, and\n\n478\n00:22:49.984 --> 00:22:52.820\nall the little systems that\nare affected is a part of it.\n\n479\n00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.040\nThat is a critical thing.\n\n480\n00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.760\nIf your company is not doing change\nmanagement, it really should.\n\n481\n00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.200\nIt's super important.\n\n482\n00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.885\nAll right, service level agreements, SLAs.\n\n483\n00:23:02.885 --> 00:23:05.435\nSLAs take two different forms.\n\n484\n00:23:05.435 --> 00:23:09.720\nThere’s SLAs that you've made and\nSLAs that people made to you.\n\n485\n00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.498\nIf you're not familiar with an SLA\nis a Service Level Agreement.\n\n486\n00:23:12.498 --> 00:23:18.510\nIt’s a guarantee that you will provide\na certain of uptime and availability.\n\n487\n00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.180\nIf I'm going to host a web server for\na company.\n\n488\n00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.862\nMaybe you hire me to host your web server.\n\n489\n00:23:22.862 --> 00:23:24.359\nI'm going to make you a guarantee.\n\n490\n00:23:24.359 --> 00:23:27.220\nI'm going to keep your\nserver up 99.9% of the time.\n\n491\n00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:32.780\nSo, I need to do whatever it takes to\nkeep your server up 99.9% of the time.\n\n492\n00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:36.630\nOn my end, I need to document the SLA so\nI know my obligation.\n\n493\n00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.410\nThis is what I need to do.\n\n494\n00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:43.770\nOn your end, you need to document the SLA\nalso because I promised it to you.\n\n495\n00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:44.440\nWhat if I don't deliver?\n\n496\n00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.433\nWhat it at the end of the year you\npull up an availability report and\n\n497\n00:23:48.433 --> 00:23:50.836\nsee that I only gave you 97% up time?\n\n498\n00:23:50.836 --> 00:23:53.238\nBut I promised you 99.9.\n\n499\n00:23:53.238 --> 00:23:54.435\nThere should be a penalty.\n\n500\n00:23:54.435 --> 00:23:55.979\nI should have to pay out on that, right?\n\n501\n00:23:55.979 --> 00:23:57.136\nBut you need to know to look or that.\n\n502\n00:23:57.136 --> 00:24:00.015\nSo you've got to have the SLA\ndocumented and so do I.\n\n503\n00:24:00.015 --> 00:24:04.220\n&gt;&gt; Don, on that thought of penalties.\n\n504\n00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.370\nCould a company that provides\na customer with an SOA and they don't,\n\n505\n00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:11.780\nlike you said in the example,\nmeet the SOA and it causes some kinda,\n\n506\n00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:15.620\nI don't know, financial repercussion for\nthat company that is the customer.\n\n507\n00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.200\nCould the person that offered\nthe SLA become financially liable?\n\n508\n00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:19.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n509\n00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.270\nCompanies go out of\nbusiness over this stuff.\n\n510\n00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:26.200\nThere's government contracts that you can\ntake where if you sign a SLA with them\n\n511\n00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.490\nthat says you're gonna provide\na certain service level and\n\n512\n00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:33.390\nyou don't, the penalties can be so\ngreat, that the company goes bankrupt.\n\n513\n00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:34.250\nThat happens.\n\n514\n00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.668\nYou can lose your business based on that.\n\n515\n00:24:36.668 --> 00:24:38.047\nYou can be legally held liable,\n\n516\n00:24:38.047 --> 00:24:42.200\nif you've falsified information saying you\ncould provide a SLA and then you couldn't.\n\n517\n00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.090\nYou can go to jail.\n\n518\n00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.950\nSLAs are a serious business.\n\n519\n00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:48.910\nWhere we normally see them is not so\nserious, it's normally bandwidth.\n\n520\n00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:53.670\nWhere they guarantee you your fiber\nlink will be up 99.999% of the time.\n\n521\n00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:54.580\nAnd then, you find out it's not.\n\n522\n00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:55.840\nAnd so, what do they do?\n\n523\n00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.885\nThey give you a credit on your monthly\nbill, and they discount you for that.\n\n524\n00:24:58.885 --> 00:25:01.680\nSo it was down for\nten minutes longer than we promised, so\n\n525\n00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.130\nwe're gonna credit you the cost of\nrunning that line for ten minutes.\n\n526\n00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.830\nIt's a negligible amount.\n\n527\n00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:09.270\nSo the SLA's not really significant there.\n\n528\n00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.370\nSometimes there are huge penalties,\nespecially on a construction contract,\n\n529\n00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:13.319\nthe penalties got really big.\n\n530\n00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.530\nThe other thing to keep in mind with SLAs\n\n531\n00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.790\nis that we do have some\nkinda way to monitor them.\n\n532\n00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:21.370\nSo anytime somebody offers you an SLA,\n\n533\n00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:24.780\nyou need to have a monitoring\nsystem that's tracking that.\n\n534\n00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:29.980\nMy cable modem at home,\nit goes down all the time.\n\n535\n00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.560\nIt's terrible, it goes down all the time.\n\n536\n00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.656\nAnd I could call the cable company and\ncomplaint and\n\n537\n00:25:33.656 --> 00:25:36.810\nthen get credits or whatever, but\nI don't have a monitoring system.\n\n538\n00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:39.330\nMonitoring system is when the kids\nget mad they can't watch Netflix.\n\n539\n00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:40.970\nSo that's my monitoring system, but\n\n540\n00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:42.980\nin a commercial environment\nyou need something real.\n\n541\n00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.718\nSomething that's actually\nmonitoring those lines.\n\n542\n00:25:44.718 --> 00:25:48.750\nLike, WhatsUp Gold, or SolarWinds\nNetwork Performance Monitor or whatever.\n\n543\n00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.220\nAnd they can tell you,\nnot just the line went down, but\n\n544\n00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:55.050\nhow long it was down cuz it might happen\nat 2 AM in the morning and nobody notices.\n\n545\n00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:56.412\nBut you still deserve a credit for that.\n\n546\n00:25:56.412 --> 00:26:00.450\nIt went down, so you need to be able\nto document that and have a record.\n\n547\n00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:05.260\nThe last documentation they call\nout is server configuration.\n\n548\n00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.390\nWhen I build up a new server,\nhow did I do it?\n\n549\n00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.230\nWhat operating system did I use?\n\n550\n00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:11.830\nWhat license did I put in it?\n\n551\n00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.650\nWhat software did I add to it?\n\n552\n00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.100\nWhat features did I change and customize?\n\n553\n00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.950\nWhat did I do to build that server up?\n\n554\n00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:22.130\nAnd this is important because I'm gonna\nbuild more servers in the future.\n\n555\n00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:26.320\nAnd if I already know the steps to\ncomplete it, I'm gonna use that.\n\n556\n00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.230\nI shared with Wes, a year or two ago, and\n\n557\n00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:29.640\nI probably should have brought\nit here up for the show.\n\n558\n00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.510\nI had this Linux build\ndocument that I use.\n\n559\n00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:32.910\nAnd anytime I deploy a Linux server,\n\n560\n00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:34.390\nthere's a standard set\nof things that I do.\n\n561\n00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:35.730\nI can't remember it all off my mind.\n\n562\n00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:36.950\nSo I'll just rattle it off.\n\n563\n00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:40.950\nSo when I deploy a new Linux server,\nI secure a DVD installer.\n\n564\n00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.660\nAnd I always use the same one\neven if there's been newer ones\n\n565\n00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:44.210\nthat have come out.\n\n566\n00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.460\nCuz I always want a consistent\ndeployment pattern.\n\n567\n00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:53.390\nSo for example, if I'm deploying CentOS\n6.5, I might know that CentOS 6.7 is out.\n\n568\n00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:57.951\nBut I'll still use the 6.5 installer and\njust do the update to 6.7 when it's done.\n\n569\n00:26:57.951 --> 00:27:00.230\nBecause I know I'll have\na consistent deployment pattern.\n\n570\n00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.020\nI always wanna have consistency.\n\n571\n00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.890\nIf I go to 6.7, now I gotta update my\ndocumentation, and that's a pain, and\n\n572\n00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:05.680\nyou don't really benefit.\n\n573\n00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.920\nSo you can always update afterwards.\n\n574\n00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.730\nSo I perform my install, and\nI have a partition scheme that I follow,\n\n575\n00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.900\nso here's how I outline my partitions.\n\n576\n00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.480\nAnd then, after that,\nwe'd let the install complete, and\n\n577\n00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.430\nI always do a minimal install,\nalways, no matter what the server is,\n\n578\n00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.320\nI always do a minimal install, so\nI choose that and do the install.\n\n579\n00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:29.101\nOnce it's done, then I can configure SSH,\nI always change the default SSH port.\n\n580\n00:27:29.101 --> 00:27:31.665\nPort 22 by default,\nI move it to something else and\n\n581\n00:27:31.665 --> 00:27:35.340\nI make sure that the root account\nis not allowed to use SSH.\n\n582\n00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.500\nAnd I create the local accounts\nthat we're gonna be using.\n\n583\n00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:42.620\nThen, I customized the firewall in SELinux\nto support the software that I'm gonna be\n\n584\n00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.230\nusing, and I installed the software\nthat I'm gonna be using.\n\n585\n00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.720\nThese are the steps that I follow, and\n\n586\n00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.140\nI do it with every single\nserver that I deploy.\n\n587\n00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.370\nBy having that document,\nit's just a series of steps I follow.\n\n588\n00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.200\nAnd I never forget a step,\nbecause they're written down.\n\n589\n00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.220\nIf I just try and do it from memory,\n\n590\n00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.340\nlike I just did,\nI probably left some stuff out.\n\n591\n00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.810\nIn fact, I can think of it right now,\nthe network configuration.\n\n592\n00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:04.080\nI always statically assign an IP, and\nI do it through the configuration files.\n\n593\n00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.940\nSo here's the configuration files I edit,\nand\n\n594\n00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.690\nhere's the lines that I edit,\nit's all right in the document.\n\n595\n00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:12.403\nThat's part of provisioning consistently,\nmaking sure all of your servers have\n\n596\n00:28:12.403 --> 00:28:15.435\na consistent profile and\nthey've got the settings that you need.\n\n597\n00:28:15.435 --> 00:28:19.874\n&gt;&gt; You know, Don, before we started this\nepisode we were kinda talking about this.\n\n598\n00:28:19.874 --> 00:28:22.737\nI mentioned, Don, is this software\nsomething you're gonna be hosting on your\n\n599\n00:28:22.737 --> 00:28:24.890\nnetwork or is this something\nthat's gonna be in the cloud?\n\n600\n00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:26.232\nAnd you mentioned, no, no, no.\n\n601\n00:28:26.232 --> 00:28:28.790\nWes, you're gonna host this on site\ncuz if you think about what's in\n\n602\n00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:32.190\nthis information, you don't want\nthat going over a public line\n\n603\n00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:35.190\nsecure not out to the cloud and\nhaving somebody else managing that.\n\n604\n00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:36.850\nSo that's a concept on security,\n\n605\n00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:39.940\ncan you talk a little about that when\nit comes to all this documentation?\n\n606\n00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:42.410\n&gt;&gt; So\nsome of this data is not very sensitive.\n\n607\n00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:46.720\nThe service manuals that we get from HPE\nor Dell or whatever, they're on the web.\n\n608\n00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.890\nI don't care if people have that,\n\n609\n00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.086\nand I don't even care if people\nknow what servers I have.\n\n610\n00:28:50.086 --> 00:28:53.743\nAll right, so they know I've\ngot a Dell MA-20 or whatever.\n\n611\n00:28:53.743 --> 00:28:55.410\nBig deal.\n\n612\n00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.460\nBut if they know the IP\naddress of the server, and\n\n613\n00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:02.430\nthey know the unique password I\nsign on a local administrator\n\n614\n00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:06.170\naccount on that server, that's not good,\nthat's not information that I want out.\n\n615\n00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:08.900\nIf they know the exact version of\nall the software I've been install,\n\n616\n00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.190\nthat's not something I want to get out, so\n\n617\n00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:14.470\nyour documentation contain\ninformation that is very sensitive.\n\n618\n00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:19.030\nSo at a minimum it needs to be\nstored in an encrypted form.\n\n619\n00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.120\nUse GPG or GPGTools.\n\n620\n00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.270\nYou can use BitLocker on a drive or\nfile encryption.\n\n621\n00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.570\nUse some kind of a security on that data.\n\n622\n00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:32.590\nIf it's store in software like\nthe SolarWinds Web Help Desk,\n\n623\n00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.950\nthey can store it in a database and\nthe database can be encrypted.\n\n624\n00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.410\nAnd I say they can store it,\nyou actually run that on your own servers.\n\n625\n00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:39.129\nWell, it is run locally, on-premises, and\n\n626\n00:29:39.129 --> 00:29:42.160\nthat's usually where you want\nyour documentation to be.\n\n627\n00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.970\nI prefer my documentation to be\non-premises because if my Internet links\n\n628\n00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:50.510\ngo down, I still need access to my\ndocumentation so I can call the ISP.\n\n629\n00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:51.400\nI didn't even know who to contact.\n\n630\n00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.420\nThat's in my documentation.\n\n631\n00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.965\nSo you always wanna make sure you've\ngot a copy that you can get at.\n\n632\n00:29:54.965 --> 00:29:57.810\nAnd it's a good idea to\nkeep some of it on paper.\n\n633\n00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:01.020\nIf you've got business resumption plans,\nthose should be printed out.\n\n634\n00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:04.860\nBecause when you need business resumption,\nwhen all of your computer systems have\n\n635\n00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:09.190\nfailed, well, if your BRP is a collection\nof PDFs stored on your SAN, and\n\n636\n00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:13.980\nyour SAN just got destroyed,\nthat BRP's not helping you at all.\n\n637\n00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:16.720\nSo I know at more than one organization,\n\n638\n00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.570\nwe had our big run books\nthat were literally books.\n\n639\n00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:21.710\nI mean, they were phone book thick.\n\n640\n00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:26.150\nAnd it had all of the instructions that\nwe needed to follow for part of BRP.\n\n641\n00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:28.657\nAnd there were two copies of that BRP.\n\n642\n00:30:28.657 --> 00:30:30.348\nOne that was at headquarters and\n\n643\n00:30:30.348 --> 00:30:34.200\none that was in the disaster\nrecovery center with the other data.\n\n644\n00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.690\nAnd so, that way if our main\nfacility was completely destroyed,\n\n645\n00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:38.660\nthat other copy was there.\n\n646\n00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:42.330\nBut we didn't keep it like, I didn't say,\nI'll take one home with me.\n\n647\n00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:44.840\nBecause that was really\nsensitive data in that book.\n\n648\n00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.632\nIf somebody got a hold on that book,\nit was the keys to the kingdom.\n\n649\n00:30:47.632 --> 00:30:53.880\nSo we had private keys and SSL\ncertificates documented inside of that.\n\n650\n00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.480\nThat's not something wise,\nsomething you want locked in a vault and\n\n651\n00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.690\nstored in a secure and safe area.\n\n652\n00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:02.845\nBut don't rely too much on digital\nstorage if it's business resumption.\n\n653\n00:31:02.845 --> 00:31:04.990\nCuz you might not have\naccess that digital storage.\n\n654\n00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:06.520\nAlways keep that in mind, too.\n\n655\n00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.630\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don,\nit's a lot of great information.\n\n656\n00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:12.660\nI know that if you have been following us\non this series, Don has been hammering\n\n657\n00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:16.950\nyou over the head, documentation,\ndocumentation, and yes more documentation.\n\n658\n00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:20.360\nSo now you actually got to see\nwhat's part of documentation.\n\n659\n00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.940\nNow, Don, it does look like we're\ncoming to the end of another episode.\n\n660\n00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:26.320\nBut before we do, do you have any final\nwords on things like asset management and\n\n661\n00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.750\ndocumentation?\n\n662\n00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:29.500\n&gt;&gt; That's it for me on this one.\n\n663\n00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.170\nI could harp on for days and\ndays on end about this.\n\n664\n00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:34.959\nWe're gonna see more just as the series\nprogresses, especially when we\n\n665\n00:31:34.959 --> 00:31:38.170\nget into troubleshooting cuz that's where\ndocumentation really comes in handy.\n\n666\n00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:41.715\nBut just remember it's a lot of work,\nit's a lot of maintenance, and\n\n667\n00:31:41.715 --> 00:31:45.801\nit seems like a lot of bureaucracy, but\nonce it saves your butt a couple of times,\n\n668\n00:31:45.801 --> 00:31:48.950\nyou'll come around and\nyou'll really appreciate it.\n\n669\n00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.980\nI've been saved by\ndocumentation more than once.\n\n670\n00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:54.600\nSo I really make sure that\nI implement it properly.\n\n671\n00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.900\n&gt;&gt; Words of wisdom and one you don't wanna\nhave to learn from personal experience.\n\n672\n00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.880\nNow, that looks like\na great place to sign off.\n\n673\n00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.690\nDon, as always, we do appreciate\nhaving you in the studios and\n\n674\n00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:05.630\nwe appreciate having you,\nthe viewer,

ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.853 --> 00:00:17.455\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan,\nand In today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:19.810\nwe're coming back with\nmore CompTIA Server+.\n\n8\n00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.700\nAnd joining us in the studios is\nnone other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.970\nDon, how are you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.550\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes,\nready to dive right back into Server+.\n\n11\n00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.960\nAnd in this episode we're covering one\nof my favorite topics, virtualization.\n\n12\n00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.690\nAnd it's one of my favorites cuz it's so\nprominent these days.\n\n13\n00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.530\nIt's one of those technologies\nthat's been around a long time.\n\n14\n00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.860\nAnd most of you have probably\nalready deployed it right now.\n\n15\n00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.130\nAnd in the early days,\n\n16\n00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.420\nit was something that people didn't\nreally wanna get involved in.\n\n17\n00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.700\nAnd it's one of those technologies\nthat really caught on mainstream now.\n\n18\n00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.970\nAnd I'm surprised anytime when I go to an\nenvironment where they aren't virtualizing\n\n19\n00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:50.890\nservers.\n\n20\n00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.600\nSo let's start up with the basics, and\n\n21\n00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.870\nthen we'll work our way up to what\nwe need to know for the exam.\n\n22\n00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.360\nThe first thing we need to understand is\nwhat the heck virtualization is, right?\n\n23\n00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.749\nAnd the best way to explain it is,\nI have a little analogy I like to use.\n\n24\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.130\nWhen most people buy things,\nthey buy more than what they need, right?\n\n25\n00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.990\nSo when you buy a server, you typically\nhave more CPU than you need, or\n\n26\n00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.760\nmore RAM than you need,\nmore storage than you need.\n\n27\n00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.190\nAnd what happens to the extra\nstuff that you're not using?\n\n28\n00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.880\nIt just sits there, it does nothing.\n\n29\n00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.040\nI've got a computer at home with\nan eight core processor in it.\n\n30\n00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.250\nI can guarantee you it's probably sitting\nthere using one core at three percent\n\n31\n00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.800\nright now, and the other core?\n\n32\n00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.140\nJust getting wasted, doing nothing.\n\n33\n00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.400\nSo virtualization tries\nto solve that problem.\n\n34\n00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.200\nIt's the equivalent of car pooling.\n\n35\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.120\nI drove to work today in my car and\nmy car has six seats.\n\n36\n00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.240\nSo in theory I could put\nsix people in the car.\n\n37\n00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.201\nI didn't I drove,\nwell I took the kids to school,\n\n38\n00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:45.710\nI guess I get a little credit for that.\n\n39\n00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.080\nBut otherwise, I came in,\nit was just me in the car.\n\n40\n00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.160\nSo, I could have put five\nmore people in that car and\n\n41\n00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.330\nreally got my money's worth out of it.\n\n42\n00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.300\nBut instead, it was just me and I wasted\nthe extra capacity of that vehicle and\n\n43\n00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.180\nwasted gas and all that stuff.\n\n44\n00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.090\nWhich I should probably feel bad about,\nbut don't.\n\n45\n00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.930\nNow, servers are the same way,\nwe buy these servers and\n\n46\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.160\nyou got multiple sockets and multiple\ncores and multiple network adapters, RAM,\n\n47\n00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.270\nand hard drives, and\nall that extra is just getting wasted.\n\n48\n00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.240\nAnd it gets frustrating because\nsometimes you might need\n\n49\n00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.050\nthose resources somewhere else.\n\n50\n00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.770\nI might have one server that's\nrunning out of storage.\n\n51\n00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.670\nMeanwhile I've got another server that\nhas a terrabyte of storage empty just\n\n52\n00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.660\nsitting right there.\n\n53\n00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.600\nBut it doesn't do any good because\nit's not in the right server.\n\n54\n00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.390\nVirtualization works to\nsolve that by carpooling.\n\n55\n00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.730\nAllowing more than one server\nto run on one set of hardware.\n\n56\n00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.450\nBy doing that, they can share components.\n\n57\n00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.920\nAnd that way,\nwe start to use our processors and\n\n58\n00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.040\nour memory to their fullest extent.\n\n59\n00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.370\nNow you have to be careful with it,\nbecause you can over subscribe, right?\n\n60\n00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.830\nMy car has six seats,\n\n61\n00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.130\nI could probably get ten people in\nthere,if they were all friendly, right?\n\n62\n00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.920\nBut now it's dangerous, now I don't have\nenough seatbelts, servers on the same way.\n\n63\n00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.350\nIf you get too many people jammed on\nthere, you're gonna run out of RAM or\n\n64\n00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.780\nyou're gonna run out of CPU.\n\n65\n00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.480\nAnd so that whole brilliant\nidea of sharing becomes not so\n\n66\n00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.000\nbrilliant anymore, right?\n\n67\n00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.440\nSo we definitely have to kinda\nuse caution as we virtualize.\n\n68\n00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.330\nBut the main thing is all these years,\n\n69\n00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.960\npeople have been telling us, don't put\nmultiple services on the same server.\n\n70\n00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.480\nBecause if one goes down it\ncan take down other things.\n\n71\n00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.390\nSo if I have a server that's a DNS server,\nand a DHCP server, and\n\n72\n00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.940\na Win server, or whatever.\n\n73\n00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.760\nIf one of them crashes it could take\nall three down, so separate them out.\n\n74\n00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.330\nBut then you separate them out and these\nare services that do hardly anything.\n\n75\n00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.210\nAnd so they just sit there,\nwasting resources.\n\n76\n00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.140\nSo instead of having them run on their\nown physical set of hardware, And\n\n77\n00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.860\nwe can run them on a virtual\nset of hardware instead.\n\n78\n00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.890\nAnd we can have more than one virtual\nset of hardware on the same piece of\n\n79\n00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.210\nreal hardware and\nreally take advantage of that.\n\n80\n00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.410\nNow, virtualization is not a new concept.\n\n81\n00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.730\nThere were servers,\nlike the old VAX machines,\n\n82\n00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.190\nthat were doing\nvirtualization in the 1970s.\n\n83\n00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.210\nSo that's not a new thing, but\nas we moved away from mainframes and\n\n84\n00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.460\nmoved to more decentralized solutions,\n\n85\n00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.940\npeople started doing dedicated\nhardware to dedicated tasks.\n\n86\n00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.840\nAnd so all throughout the late 1980s and\n\n87\n00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.310\nmost of the 1990s,\npeople hated virtualization.\n\n88\n00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.670\nAnd companies like VMWare,\n\n89\n00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.230\nthat started in the 1990s, they didn't\nreally get a lot of traction right away.\n\n90\n00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.270\nPeople said no, we'll use real hardware.\n\n91\n00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.800\nRight up until the dot com bubble burst\nand all the tech money disappeared.\n\n92\n00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.910\nAnd you couldn't make a dumb pet sock\ncompany and buy Super Bowl ads anymore.\n\n93\n00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:36.450\nOnce that happened,\n\n94\n00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.750\npeople said ooh, we probably need to make\nbetter use of the hardware that we have.\n\n95\n00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.050\nAnd all of a sudden that technology\nreally started to advance.\n\n96\n00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.210\nAnd there's actually two different\ngenerations of the technology that\n\n97\n00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.100\nare out there.\n\n98\n00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.740\nAnd it was when the second generation\nof that technology came out that we\n\n99\n00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.830\nreally saw things move forward\nbecause of the huge performance gains.\n\n100\n00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.960\nSo let's talk about those generations.\n\n101\n00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:02.050\nWhen you do virtualization,\nyou've got a host and you've got guests.\n\n102\n00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.000\nThe hosts is the actual hardware.\n\n103\n00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.300\nSo in my car example,\nmy car would be the host and\n\n104\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.140\nthe people inside it would be guests.\n\n105\n00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.245\nI can swap people out, but\nthe car is the car, that's how it is.\n\n106\n00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:16.710\nWell, I might have a physical server,\nthat's the host.\n\n107\n00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.470\nAnd then I have virtual machines,\nthese virtual sets of hardware,\n\n108\n00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.290\nthose are the guests.\n\n109\n00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.210\nAnd I can swap them out as I need,\nand I can add more or take some away.\n\n110\n00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.940\nI've got control of that and that's\nthe guest side of things, all right?\n\n111\n00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.780\nNow on the host, it has to share\nits hardware across all the guests.\n\n112\n00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.790\nAnd the way it does that is by using\na technology called a hypervisor.\n\n113\n00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.740\nAnd what a hypervisor does is it\nsits in between the guests and\n\n114\n00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.590\nthe hardware, and\nit acts like a traffic cop.\n\n115\n00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.800\nAnd it says,\nyou're allowed to access the memory.\n\n116\n00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.260\nNope, now you need to stop this other\nperson is allowed to access the memory.\n\n117\n00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.250\nNow they need to stop,\nnow the next guy, and so on.\n\n118\n00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.079\nThe hypervisor handles that communication.\n\n119\n00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.200\nWell, in virtualization technologies\nreleased in the 1990s and early 2000s,\n\n120\n00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.340\nyou had a type of hypervisor\nthat was not terribly efficient.\n\n121\n00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.000\nBecause what it was doing\nwas emulating hardware.\n\n122\n00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.850\nAnd then in the mid 2000s, you started\nto see a new technology come out.\n\n123\n00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.430\nWhich was a type of hypervisor\nthat didn't do emulation.\n\n124\n00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.750\nThat actually allowed access to the real\nhardware, which was significantly faster.\n\n125\n00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.630\nAnd that's when we saw general adoption\nof virtualization technologies.\n\n126\n00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.110\nBy the time we hit 2005,\nthat was in full speed.\n\n127\n00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.060\nAnd now, in 2017,\n\n128\n00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.930\nit's rare to find a network where\nyou're not using virtualization.\n\n129\n00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.510\nAnd it's thanks to the newer\ntype of hypervisor.\n\n130\n00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.600\nNow, where it gets confusing is\nthey've numbered the hypervisors.\n\n131\n00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.012\nYou have a Type-1 and a Type-2 hypervisor.\n\n132\n00:06:45.012 --> 00:06:49.098\nThe Type-1 hypervisor, that's the new one,\nthat's the one we like.\n\n133\n00:06:49.098 --> 00:06:52.380\nAnd the Type-2 hypervisor, that's the old\none, which technically came out first.\n\n134\n00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.910\nSo the numbering is backwards and\nthat's confusing and\n\n135\n00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.680\nit makes where you get a question wrong\non the test if you don't pay attention.\n\n136\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.000\nSo let's talk about these and just make\nsure you memorize it that the Type-2\n\n137\n00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.675\nhypervisor is actually\nthe older of the two.\n\n138\n00:07:03.675 --> 00:07:07.340\nType-2 hypervisors worked via emulation.\n\n139\n00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.200\nSo I got a little diagram that\nkinda shows how they did that.\n\n140\n00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.290\nSo here's an example of how\na Type-2 hypervisor works.\n\n141\n00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:18.120\nThat you've got real server hardware,\nit's got CPU, RAM, network disc,\n\n142\n00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.320\nthose are the components in that hardware.\n\n143\n00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.710\nAnd on top of that hardware,\nyou're running an operating system.\n\n144\n00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.980\nAnd it might be Microsoft Windows,\nit might be Linux,\n\n145\n00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.550\nit might be MacOS, probably not.\n\n146\n00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.390\nIt might be VMware, ESX or\nsomething like that, but\n\n147\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.350\nthat's gonna be your\nhost operating system.\n\n148\n00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.050\nAnd then on top of that host,\nyou've got management software.\n\n149\n00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.870\nSo if it's Windows,\n\n150\n00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.940\nyou've got all your interface and\nthe stuff you use to manage it.\n\n151\n00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:49.050\nAnd on top of that, you install\na program that is a Type-2 hypervisor.\n\n152\n00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.090\nAnd some examples of Type-2 hypervisors\nwould be like VMWare Workstation,\n\n153\n00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.200\nVMWare Fusion is another one.\n\n154\n00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.472\nThat one runs on Mac, VMWare Workstation\nruns on everything else.\n\n155\n00:07:59.472 --> 00:08:00.620\nYou've got-\n&gt;&gt; VirtualBox?\n\n156\n00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:06.014\n&gt;&gt; VirtualBox is another great example,\nMicrosoft had, Virtual PC was theirs.\n\n157\n00:08:06.014 --> 00:08:07.501\nParallels is another one.\n\n158\n00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:09.525\nThere's several of them out there,\nthat are Type 2 Hypervisor.\n\n159\n00:08:09.525 --> 00:08:11.260\nAnd they're still sold today,\nand they're still used.\n\n160\n00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.120\nI actually have one in\nmy laptop right now.\n\n161\n00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.130\nI'm not using it but VM Ware Fusion\nwhich is a Type 2 Hypervisor.\n\n162\n00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.650\nSo it's just a program that I installed.\n\n163\n00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:19.710\nI can uninstall it if I want.\n\n164\n00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.820\nI think I have Virtual Box on here\nalso cuz I use it for Docker.\n\n165\n00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.740\nYou can just go and download it.\n\n166\n00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.590\nVirtual Box is free.\n\n167\n00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.639\nYou go to VirtualBox.org,\ndownload it, and install it.\n\n168\n00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:32.190\nNow that's a programe running on whatever\noperating system you already had.\n\n169\n00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.560\nSo your current operating\nsystem is the host and\n\n170\n00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.200\na hypervisor is running on top of it.\n\n171\n00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:41.080\nAnd that type 2 hypervisor can\nthen create virtual hardware.\n\n172\n00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.920\nVirtual CPU, RAM network and disk,\nand create a virtual machine.\n\n173\n00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:50.320\nAnd you can then install a guest\noperating system on top of it.\n\n174\n00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.600\nSo I might be running\nWindows as my host OS but\n\n175\n00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.320\nI might be running\nRed Hat Linux in the guest.\n\n176\n00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.190\nOr CentOS Linux or Debian, or whatever.\n\n177\n00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:04.630\nI might have Mac OS as my host and\nbe running Windows, and Linux, and\n\n178\n00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.050\neven Mac OS in my virtual machines.\n\n179\n00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.440\nThe guest operating system doesn't have\nto match the host because the guest\n\n180\n00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.570\nsees it's own set of hardware, it's own\nnetwork adapter, it's own CPU and so on.\n\n181\n00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.760\nThe problem here it's that seeing\nhardware that's not real, right?\n\n182\n00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.603\nIt's seeing this fake hardware\nthat's being emulated.\n\n183\n00:09:23.603 --> 00:09:27.875\nThe type 2 hypervisor's emulating\na set of hardware that's designed to\n\n184\n00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:31.275\njust be super compatible to support\nthe most operating systems possible.\n\n185\n00:09:31.275 --> 00:09:36.005\nSo when this guest OS talks to the CPU,\nit's not a real CPU.\n\n186\n00:09:36.005 --> 00:09:40.510\nAnd the hypervisor has to intercept\nthat call change the call\n\n187\n00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:45.290\nto match what our host OS expects and\nthen send it to our real CPU.\n\n188\n00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:50.960\nSo the hypervisor is involved in every\nsingle hardware call, every time you talk\n\n189\n00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:56.600\nto the network card, the hard drive, the\nmemory, the CPU, it's getting involved.\n\n190\n00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.100\nAnd it's having to translate those calls.\n\n191\n00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.320\nAnd that's not necessarily a good thing.\n\n192\n00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.230\n&gt;&gt; Don, it seems like there's a lot of\ncongestion when it comes to communicating\n\n193\n00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.540\nwith the hardware,\ncuz it looks like the operating system.\n\n194\n00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.950\nIt's already communicating\nwith the hardware.\n\n195\n00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.370\nThen you have additional applications that\nare running in that operating system.\n\n196\n00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.780\nAnd now you add the hypervisor which it\nseems like just another software program\n\n197\n00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.320\nside by side with everything else.\n\n198\n00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it is,\nwhen we talk about speed on the server,\n\n199\n00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.980\nyou hear people use terms like\nbare metal or wire speed, right?\n\n200\n00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.360\nWire speed means by putting electrical\nimpulse on one end of the wire, it's gonna\n\n201\n00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.720\ntravel at the speed of light minus the\nresistance of the wire to the other end.\n\n202\n00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.800\nThat's its speed, and\nit's pretty darn fast.\n\n203\n00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.220\nBut if there's something in between\nmessing with it, it's gonna slow it down,\n\n204\n00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.340\nand now I'm not at wire speed.\n\n205\n00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.780\nAnd when I send electricity\nacross a motherboard,\n\n206\n00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.540\nI expect it to be at wire speed.\n\n207\n00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.680\nBut when this virtual machine\nsends electricity to it's CPU,\n\n208\n00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.180\nit's not even real electricity, right?\n\n209\n00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.200\nIt is ones and zeros,\n\n210\n00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.520\nand it's having to be messed with by\nthe Hypervisor and that slows it down.\n\n211\n00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.850\nBare metal that means if I was running\nthis guess OS on the actual hardware.\n\n212\n00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.370\nOn the bare metal of that server, I would\nget a certain level of performance.\n\n213\n00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:10.040\nA type 2 hypervisor does not give\nyou that level of performance.\n\n214\n00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.549\nSo why are they still being sold today?\n\n215\n00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.600\nBecause they're still really\nuseful in research, tests,\n\n216\n00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:21.450\ndevelopment, nonproduction services,\nthings that affect only a single user.\n\n217\n00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:22.560\nStuff like me.\n\n218\n00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.380\nI like to mess with a ton\nof operating systems, and\n\n219\n00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.640\nI kind of get tired of formatting\nmy laptop every couple of weeks.\n\n220\n00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.490\nI still do that, but anyhow.\n\n221\n00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.410\nSo it gives you a chance to work with\na lot of those different technologies.\n\n222\n00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:35.410\nBut it's not really good for production.\n\n223\n00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:39.510\nAnd that's why people hated\nvirtualization in the 90s.\n\n224\n00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.990\nAnd just all throughout the 1990s.\n\n225\n00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.980\nBecause type 2 hypervisor is what we had.\n\n226\n00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.780\nThat was what was out there.\n\n227\n00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:52.360\nWell the creation or popularization of\ntype 1 hypervisors are what saved the day.\n\n228\n00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.330\nSo a type 1 hypervisor works different.\n\n229\n00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.960\nThis is an example of a type 1 hypervisor.\n\n230\n00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.940\nNow, notice just right off the bat,\nmy diagram is smaller.\n\n231\n00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.910\nThere's less stuff in the mix.\n\n232\n00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.970\nI still have server hardware with CPU,\nRAM, network, and disk.\n\n233\n00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:12.789\nBut the host OS is not running right\non top of the server hardware anymore.\n\n234\n00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:19.350\nInstead, the type 1 hypervisor is\nrunning right on the server hardware.\n\n235\n00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:22.410\nIt's running right on the bare metal.\n\n236\n00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:27.020\nAnd then, the host and all my guests\nrun on top of the hypervisor.\n\n237\n00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.510\nNotice how the host is\nactually a virtual machine.\n\n238\n00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.820\nWhen you use a type 1 hypervisor,\n\n239\n00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.460\nyour host is actually running\non top of that hypervisor.\n\n240\n00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.700\nIt might not look like it.\n\n241\n00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.520\nYou're logged into Windows and\nyou got a desktop, or Red Hat, and\n\n242\n00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.900\nyou've got a desktop.\n\n243\n00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.070\nBut you're actually running on a virtual\nmachine, running on top of a hypervisor.\n\n244\n00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.540\nEverything is running on a hypervisor.\n\n245\n00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:53.470\nAnd instead of emulating the hardware,\nit's just acting like a gatekeeper,\n\n246\n00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.840\nnot for all of it, there's something\nlike your network adapter and\n\n247\n00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.650\nyour disk, where they get virtualized\nby default, so they'll still be\n\n248\n00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.780\nemulated because your disk, you won't\nhave access to a physical disk normally.\n\n249\n00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.370\nYou have access to a file\nthat represents your disk, so\n\n250\n00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:09.789\nthat kinda changes how that works.\n\n251\n00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:16.510\nBut as far as CPU and memory, we can\ntake these calls from each guest and\n\n252\n00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.790\nfrom the host, and send them to\nthe real CPU without manipulating them.\n\n253\n00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:25.760\nIf I have an Intel i7 on my\nserver hardware or an Intel Zion.\n\n254\n00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.650\nThe host and the guest will actually see,\nan Intel Zion.\n\n255\n00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.650\nIt won't see a generic CPU.\n\n256\n00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:34.600\nAnd if I've got 16 gigs\nof memory in my system or\n\n257\n00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.090\n64 gigs of memory, they'll see that\nmemory and be able to communicate to it.\n\n258\n00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.260\nI might have sliced it and\nlimited them down, but\n\n259\n00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.190\nthey'll be talking to real memory.\n\n260\n00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:46.400\n&gt;&gt; You know in the first\nType 2 Hypervisor,\n\n261\n00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.810\nDon you mentioned how the Hypervisor has\nto translate that into something that\n\n262\n00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:53.160\nthe operating system understands,\nthen it goes down to the hardware here.\n\n263\n00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.090\nWhere do drivers come in to play\nwith a Type 1 Hypervisor if you\n\n264\n00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:00.080\nhave direct access as\nfar as to the hardware?\n\n265\n00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.890\nIf I do have these guest\noperating systems on here.\n\n266\n00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:06.580\nHow does the drivers,\nwhere do they come in to play for us?\n\n267\n00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.210\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nyou're almost always gonna have drivers.\n\n268\n00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:14.690\nUnder a Type 2 Hypervisor, they usually\ntry to create really compatible hardware.\n\n269\n00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.360\nSo if you fired up Linux or Windows,\nmost of the drivers are already baked in\n\n270\n00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.200\nbecause they emulated generic\nhardware that everybody supported.\n\n271\n00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.030\nBut when you're reflecting real hardware,\n\n272\n00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.230\nlike with the type 1 hypervisor,\nyou're gonna need drivers.\n\n273\n00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.680\nSo most of your virtualization\nsoftware will have a driver pack\n\n274\n00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.360\nthat you load in and it works.\n\n275\n00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.800\nYour storage and network are usually\nbeing emulated anyway, so\n\n276\n00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.260\nthat'll be a part of that driver pack.\n\n277\n00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.210\nOn the CPU side, well Intel CPU,\n\n278\n00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.490\nAMD CPU, your software's\nalready gonna support that.\n\n279\n00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:41.390\nYou don't need a driver there.\n\n280\n00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.620\nAnd RAM, you don't need a driver for\nRAM either.\n\n281\n00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.860\nSo it really just comes down\nto network and hard drive.\n\n282\n00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:49.300\nAnd those will be part of whatever\nvirtualization software you're using.\n\n283\n00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.750\nThey'll have a little package that you\nhave to install on the virtual machines\n\n284\n00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.460\nafter you create them.\n\n285\n00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.120\nSo not a big deal there to\nget those taken care of.\n\n286\n00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.010\nAnd then the virtual machines are up and\nrunning.\n\n287\n00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:59.350\nAnd they run pretty fast.\n\n288\n00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:04.280\nSo examples of type 1 hypervisors\nare things like VMware ESXi.\n\n289\n00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.380\nSometimes people call it VMware Vsphere,\nwhich is the name of the suite\n\n290\n00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.980\nof software, but\nESXi is the actual hypervisor.\n\n291\n00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.040\nYou've got Microsoft HyperV.\n\n292\n00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:17.360\nYou've got KVM, and what are some of\nthe other ones that are out there?\n\n293\n00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:17.920\nZen, right?\n\n294\n00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.840\nZen is probably one of the biggest\nopen sourced ones that are out there.\n\n295\n00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.710\nCitrix Xen being\nthe commercial version of it.\n\n296\n00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.247\nBut that's what AWS, Amazon Web Services.\n\n297\n00:15:26.247 --> 00:15:27.910\nThey use Xen for all their stuff.\n\n298\n00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:31.320\nSo there's a number of different\nsolutions that are out there.\n\n299\n00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.730\nAnd they're type 1 hypervisor.\n\n300\n00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:35.120\nThey run at near wire speed.\n\n301\n00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.980\nUsually at wire speed for most operations\nwhich makes performance great.\n\n302\n00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.410\nSo now we can really start to consolidate\nour workload on these servers and\n\n303\n00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.770\nreally get things kind of cooking.\n\n304\n00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:50.220\nNow there are hybrid hypervisors that\nare in between type 1 and type 2.\n\n305\n00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:55.020\nI mentioned I run VM fusion on my laptop,\ntechnically it is a hybrid that it does\n\n306\n00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.060\nhave some type 1\nfunctionality built into it.\n\n307\n00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.102\nAnd what that really comes\ndown to is whether or\n\n308\n00:16:01.102 --> 00:16:04.536\nnot your CPU supports\nvirtualization extensions.\n\n309\n00:16:04.536 --> 00:16:08.733\nFor a type 1 hypervisor,\nyou have to have Intel VTX or\n\n310\n00:16:08.733 --> 00:16:11.970\nAMD V support built into the CPU.\n\n311\n00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.880\nFor a type 2 hypervisor, you don't.\n\n312\n00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.020\nType 2 hypervisor it's\nemulating the hardware anyway.\n\n313\n00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:16.660\nWhat does it care?\n\n314\n00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.180\nAnd it's gonna run at poor performance.\n\n315\n00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.890\nBut type 1,\nyou're exposing actual hardware.\n\n316\n00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.060\nSo you've gotta have that\nsupport built into the CPU.\n\n317\n00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.780\nA hybrid, virtualization platform,\n\n318\n00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.790\na hybrid hypervisor,\ncan operate in both modes.\n\n319\n00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:33.790\nAnd VMware Fusion does that, where it'll\nsay, all right, if I see the extensions,\n\n320\n00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.520\nI can leverage that, and\ntake advantage of it.\n\n321\n00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.190\nBut if I don't see the extensions,\nI'm going to emulate and run.\n\n322\n00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:39.670\nVirtualBox can do that, too,\n\n323\n00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.890\nthe newer versions of\nVirtualBox operate as a hybrid.\n\n324\n00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.160\nWhich is kinda neat that\nyou've got that functionality.\n\n325\n00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.040\nBut normally in production,\nwe're not using something like VirtualBox.\n\n326\n00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.080\nThose are really designed for desktops, so\n\n327\n00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:55.750\non the server side it's really\ngoing to be EXXI, Hyper-V, and\n\n328\n00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.920\nXen are the three big ones, with KVM kind\nof thrown in there also, you know the,\n\n329\n00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.210\nanother thing that I think of, Don, is\nthings like BIOS and UEFI compatibility.\n\n330\n00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.240\nLike maybe I want to in\nmy virtual machines.\n\n331\n00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.620\nMaybe I want to implement\nsomething like Secure Boot,\n\n332\n00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:11.220\nwhich we know we have to\nhave UEFI support for that.\n\n333\n00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.710\nWhere does that come into play?\n\n334\n00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.350\nYou know,\nbasically our firmware where we store it.\n\n335\n00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.990\n&gt;&gt; So, you've got your firmware for\nthe server itself.\n\n336\n00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.060\nAnd I mention like the VTX extension.\n\n337\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.500\nWe saw that back in\nthe installing server episodes.\n\n338\n00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.950\nWhere we went in to the bios on a server,\nand we had to enable the virtualization\n\n339\n00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:30.360\nextensions, VTX for the CPO extensions,\nVTD for the storage extensions.\n\n340\n00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.730\nWe had to turn that on.\n\n341\n00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:35.850\nWell your virtual machines,\nthey're gonna get a virtual bios, right?\n\n342\n00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.030\nThey're never gonna get a really bios,\n\n343\n00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:40.060\nyou'd have to have multiple bios chips in\nyour server and your not gonna have that.\n\n344\n00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.570\nSo they're always gonna get\na virtual one when they pull it.\n\n345\n00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:47.190\nAnd, some of the hypervisors out\nthere support UEFI, ESXI does.\n\n346\n00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.590\nSo you can have virtual\nmachines that boot into UEFI.\n\n347\n00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.240\nNow, remember the benefit of UEFI.\n\n348\n00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.780\nThings like secure boot, right?\n\n349\n00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:57.360\nStopping somebody from hijacking\nyour machine and booting another OS.\n\n350\n00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.350\nCan they do that with a VM?\n\n351\n00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:00.440\nNot really.\n\n352\n00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.410\nSo we don't really care,\nabout UEFI with a virtual machine.\n\n353\n00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:04.140\nAt least not yet.\n\n354\n00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.380\nMaybe one day we will, but the support is\nthere, so if you want it, you can do it.\n\n355\n00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.840\nBut we're more concerned on our physical\nhardware, on the actual server.\n\n356\n00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.680\nAnd there you are seeing UFEI support on\nmost servers that are released today, and\n\n357\n00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.440\nsecure boot for your hypervisor, right,\nto make sure that it's not compromised for\n\n358\n00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.520\npeople to gain access.\n\n359\n00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.900\n&gt;&gt; So BIOS and UAFI's more like you\nsaid about not the virtual machines, but\n\n360\n00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.270\nmore about the physical hardware itself.\n\n361\n00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.090\n&gt;&gt; Right, right absolutely.\n\n362\n00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.790\nAll right.\nThe next thing that I'm to show you guys\n\n363\n00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:37.360\nis, how we do the resource allocation and\nset this up.\n\n364\n00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.860\nAnd I wanna show you\nan example on a real machine.\n\n365\n00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.300\nSo I've got a machine fired\nup here in the background.\n\n366\n00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.880\nAnd unfortunately this\nserver uses a really,\n\n367\n00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.980\nreally high or low DPI,\nhigh DPI, whatever.\n\n368\n00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:49.910\nIt's microscopic font.\n\n369\n00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.240\nSo I'm gonna have to zoom in a bit.\n\n370\n00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.590\nBut this is a Hyper-V server that\nwe have running here in the studio.\n\n371\n00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.510\nAnd some of our guys use it here for\nthe security shows, and\n\n372\n00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:02.750\nthings where need they need\nvirtual machines fired up.\n\n373\n00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.220\nSo this ones built around and\nIntel I7 platform.\n\n374\n00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.320\nWhich has virtualization extensions.\n\n375\n00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.100\nAnd it's running Windows Server 2106,\nI believe, with Hyper-V on it.\n\n376\n00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.040\nAnd Hyper-V is Microsoft's\ntype one hyper visor.\n\n377\n00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.340\nSo technically the host.\n\n378\n00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.810\nThis Windows Server 2016 machine\nthat I'm looking at here.\n\n379\n00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:24.550\nThis machine Is a virtual machine.\n\n380\n00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:27.090\nEven though it's running on the hardware.\n\n381\n00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.710\nSo when I look at it it shows\nas Windows Server 2016 edition,\n\n382\n00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:35.370\nit's got an Intel core i7 CPU,\nit's got 64 gigs of RAM.\n\n383\n00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:38.430\nIt thinks that it's\nrunning on the hardware.\n\n384\n00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:43.690\nIf I go into its device manager, it's\ngonna show the hardware of this server,\n\n385\n00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.330\nand not something emulated,\nbut something real.\n\n386\n00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.140\nWhen I look at the disk drives.\n\n387\n00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.060\nI see the Intel Raid volumes.\n\n388\n00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:51.140\nOr the Samsung SSD.\n\n389\n00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.900\nI don't see a virtual hard drive file.\n\n390\n00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.350\nRight?\nOr a Hyper-V virtual drive.\n\n391\n00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.120\nI don't see anything like that.\n\n392\n00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.090\nBut it is a virtual machine.\n\n393\n00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:02.160\nIt is running on top of\nthe type one hyper visor.\n\n394\n00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.790\nAnd, so\nit has access to all these resources.\n\n395\n00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:09.120\nAs gatewayed by the HyperVisor.\n\n396\n00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.590\nSo, when I started\ncreating virtual machines.\n\n397\n00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:15.220\nLike, if we look at this whole, list\nof virtual machines that are back here.\n\n398\n00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.400\nI don't wanna mess with too many of these,\nbecause Mike Rodrick is using them, and\n\n399\n00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.430\nI don't want him mad at me.\n\n400\n00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:20.700\nBut, you can look at these machines.\n\n401\n00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.960\nHe's got a couple of them that are up and\nrunning, and he’s assigned memory to them,\n\n402\n00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.990\nhe sliced out two gigs of RAM for\nthis VM, four gigs of ram this VM.\n\n403\n00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:30.160\nAnd they’ve been running for\n\n404\n00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.550\na little over an hour, and\nthey’re sitting there at 0 CPU.\n\n405\n00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.410\nHere’s a server that’s got a ton of\nvirtual machines on it, most of which\n\n406\n00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:41.140\nare turned off and most of them are not\nreally consuming any resources.\n\n407\n00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.480\nSo, you’ll see I can bring up more virtual\nmachines and consume CPU if I want,\n\n408\n00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.050\ncuz I got a ton available.\n\n409\n00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.260\nBut eventually, I'd run out of memory.\n\n410\n00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.880\nI've got 64 gigs of RAM in this server.\n\n411\n00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.040\nEventually, if I fire all these up,\nI might run out of memory.\n\n412\n00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.960\nAnd I need to be aware of that so\nI can build my machines appropriately.\n\n413\n00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.460\nWhen you create a virtual machine, It's\nkind of like going shopping for a server.\n\n414\n00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.040\nBecause when you go to build it.\n\n415\n00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.930\nIt's going to ask us a bunch of questions,\nabout how we want that server designed.\n\n416\n00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.460\nAnd so\nas we move forward you give it a name.\n\n417\n00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.580\nAnd then you start picking things like\nhow big do you want the hard drive to be?\n\n418\n00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.625\nHow may network adapters do you need?\n\n419\n00:21:14.625 --> 00:21:15.625\nAll that stuff.\n\n420\n00:21:15.625 --> 00:21:18.055\nSo let's say,\nI want to build a remote access server so\n\n421\n00:21:18.055 --> 00:21:20.075\nthat people can VPN in and\naccess the server.\n\n422\n00:21:20.075 --> 00:21:26.245\nSo I might call this ITPROTV-RA,\nit's going to be our remote access server.\n\n423\n00:21:26.245 --> 00:21:30.205\nAnd I can put the hard drives on\na particular location if I want.\n\n424\n00:21:30.205 --> 00:21:32.775\nI can pick between generation one and\ngeneration two.\n\n425\n00:21:32.775 --> 00:21:33.975\nNow what is this?\n\n426\n00:21:33.975 --> 00:21:36.940\nYou'll see this in all the virtualization\nproducts not just Microsoft.\n\n427\n00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.310\nOvertime they upgrade their software.\n\n428\n00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:42.790\nAnd when they upgrade like when a new\nversion of, vSphere comes out they add new\n\n429\n00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:47.290\nfeatures, they add things like UEFI\nsupport or support for larger hard drives.\n\n430\n00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.240\nAnd so that's what it's telling\nme here is I need to pick.\n\n431\n00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:53.520\nIf I go with generation one,\nI can do 32 bit machines or 64 bit.\n\n432\n00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.620\nBut if I go generation two,\nI can only do 64 bit and\n\n433\n00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.260\nthe reason is we get UEFI support.\n\n434\n00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.190\nAnd they've only built that around\n64-bit for this virtual machine so\n\n435\n00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.520\nI lose 32-bit support but I gain UEFI.\n\n436\n00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.540\nSo I have to pick which I wanna do.\n\n437\n00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.310\nI'm gonna go for it, I'll go UEFI.\n\n438\n00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.640\nThen how much memory do I want to give it?\n\n439\n00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:18.130\nAnd remember, we're competing\nwith other virtual machines.\n\n440\n00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.760\nSo when I assign this memory,\n\n441\n00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:24.060\nif I assign it too much I might not be\nable to boot all of my VMs at once.\n\n442\n00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.410\nSome hyper visors support dynamic memory.\n\n443\n00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.020\nOr I might give it 32 gigs of ram, but\n\n444\n00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:32.580\nif it's only using five it will just take\nfive and somebody else can use the rest.\n\n445\n00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.160\nBut when you do dynamic memory,\n\n446\n00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:39.010\nif I need more, it might not be available\nwhen I need it, and then I can't get it.\n\n447\n00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.220\nSo normally you're doing\na static assignment.\n\n448\n00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:46.660\nIf I give this server four gigs of memory\nIt's going to get the four gigs right now.\n\n449\n00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:52.140\nIf I check dynamic, it's only going to get\nfour gigs when I actually go to use it.\n\n450\n00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.150\nAnd that's not necessarily what I\nwant in a production environment.\n\n451\n00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:58.530\n&gt;&gt; I was just going to say, I thought we\nwere in another episode where you said,\n\n452\n00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:02.800\nMatt I do not use that\ndynamic memory because\n\n453\n00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.990\n&gt;&gt; You need it, you need it, you need it,\n\n454\n00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.550\nso when you do need it,\nyou need it to be there.\n\n455\n00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:10.370\n&gt;&gt; You know, I might use it on my laptop,\nif I'm labbing something up.\n\n456\n00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:13.370\nI've only got 16 gigs of RAM on my laptop.\n\n457\n00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:17.760\nWhat if I need to bring up two virtual\nmachines with eight gigs of RAM each?\n\n458\n00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.630\nWell, that's 16 gigs, perfect!\n\n459\n00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.410\nWell, I've got this host OS that\nkind of needs some memory too,\n\n460\n00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:23.980\nthough, I can't do it.\n\n461\n00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:27.340\n&gt;&gt; but if I give them dynamic memory,\nas long as they're both not using\n\n462\n00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.550\nall the memory they have, they'll actually\nfit and I can oversubscribe my memory.\n\n463\n00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.950\nI can assign more RAM\nthan I actually have.\n\n464\n00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.970\nThat's fine in a lab, not in production.\n\n465\n00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:41.180\nSo I'm not going to check that option off,\nall right, then we use networking now,\n\n466\n00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.660\nin this little wizard it's only\ngoing to add one network adapter for\n\n467\n00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.270\nme, but I can add in more if I need it,\nand these network adapters are kind of\n\n468\n00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.060\npartitioned out you might have\nwhat is an internal only network,\n\n469\n00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.340\nin other words the virtual machines\ncan talk to each other and that's it,\n\n470\n00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.300\nyou might have the words isolated\nwhere it can only talk to itself, or\n\n471\n00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.570\none that's a little more communal, where\nyou can actually see the host OS too.\n\n472\n00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:03.380\nSo the virtual machines can see the host.\n\n473\n00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.611\nOr external,\nwhere we can see the entire network and\n\n474\n00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:08.672\ntalk just like any other server.\n\n475\n00:24:08.672 --> 00:24:14.930\nThese networks, Don, do they function\njust like a regular network?\n\n476\n00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:18.560\nDo they support all the regular network\noperations that we would see if I\n\n477\n00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.260\nunplug this cable and\nplug it right into the wall there,\n\n478\n00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.220\ndo we see that there when it comes\nto the virtualized switches?\n\n479\n00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you don't see it here in the\nwizard but I can pull it up here in just\n\n480\n00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:29.650\na moment and show you were they\nfunction like network devices.\n\n481\n00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:33.550\nSo effectively what I'm picking from\nhere are virtual network switches.\n\n482\n00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:36.070\nSo think of each one of these as\na switch that I'm plugging into.\n\n483\n00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:40.930\nSo I'm plugging a virtual cable\nbetween my VM into lab external right?\n\n484\n00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:45.090\nOr studio land management, so\nI'll plug my cable into that switch.\n\n485\n00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:47.760\nAnd then I can go back and\nI can look at the switch config, and\n\n486\n00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.760\nyou'll see where we support VLANs, we\nsupport trunking, we support all sorts of\n\n487\n00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.970\nthings that you would on a normal\nswitch right here on the virtual one.\n\n488\n00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.010\nHere, I can pick my hard drive size,\nso I allocate that out again.\n\n489\n00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:01.350\nStorage is limited, so\nI don't want to go crazy on my storage,\n\n490\n00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.040\nI want to assign what I'm\nactually going to use.\n\n491\n00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.290\nSo maybe this sever's only\ngonna use 30 gigs, right?\n\n492\n00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.040\nAnd I can go up to 64 terabytes\non this particular one\n\n493\n00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.790\nbecause I did generation two.\n\n494\n00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.000\nIf I had done generation one\nit would be a smaller number.\n\n495\n00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.340\nI think it's two terabytes on\ngeneration one if I remember right.\n\n496\n00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.170\nBut we can kinda pick and designate that.\n\n497\n00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.530\nAnd then any other operations I wanna do\nhere, like picking the operating system.\n\n498\n00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.360\nSo I'm not gonna install an operating\nsystem cuz it'll take too long.\n\n499\n00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:28.890\nBut after that it can create that virtual\nmachine and get it built up for me and\n\n500\n00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:30.980\nnow I've got a server ready to deploy.\n\n501\n00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:35.235\nAssuming that all the hardware resources\nare available for it, there it is.\n\n502\n00:25:35.235 --> 00:25:37.242\nAlright, now if I go back in and\n\n503\n00:25:37.242 --> 00:25:42.184\nedit that when I edit it if I can manage\nto get into the settings, there we go,\n\n504\n00:25:42.184 --> 00:25:46.145\nwhen I edit that you'll see I\nhave a lot more options in here.\n\n505\n00:25:46.145 --> 00:25:47.840\nThings like the firmware.\n\n506\n00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.830\nWhat's the boot order?\n\n507\n00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:52.100\nDo I boot from the network first, and then\nthe hard drive, or the other way around?\n\n508\n00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.700\nI can do my memory, and\nincrease it or decrease it.\n\n509\n00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.270\nI can turn dynamic on and off.\n\n510\n00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.460\nI can add more processors.\n\n511\n00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.200\nI've only got one processor.\n\n512\n00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.200\nWell, I want two, two CPUs.\n\n513\n00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:05.320\nI can over subscribe and\nexceed the amount of physical CPUs I have,\n\n514\n00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.640\nthough it's not a good idea.\n\n515\n00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.990\nAnd, you can also set things like\ncompatibility for old OSs and\n\n516\n00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.700\nstanding technologies like NUMA, to be\nable to take advantage of multiple CPUs on\n\n517\n00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.820\nmultiple physical machines, that really\ngets kind of advanced on that stuff.\n\n518\n00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.170\nWe can set up our hard drives if they're\ngonna be visible on our machine,\n\n519\n00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.140\nthe network adapters.\n\n520\n00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:22.900\nWe can tweak those.\n\n521\n00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.850\nAnd here's where we see VLAN IDs.\n\n522\n00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.740\nBandwidth management,\nwe can do quality service.\n\n523\n00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.440\nWe can restrict some VMs and\nallow others to have dedicated access.\n\n524\n00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.519\nSo, you could really tweak things.\n\n525\n00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:37.930\nWe also see the integration services which\nis part of that software package that we\n\n526\n00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:41.470\ninstall that lets the virtual machines\ncommunicate properly with the hypervisor.\n\n527\n00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:42.690\nEach system has that.\n\n528\n00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:46.980\nMicrosoft calls theirs integration\nservices or VM additions.\n\n529\n00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.520\nVMware calls theirs VMware tools, you have\nto install the VM tools on your system.\n\n530\n00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.290\nNow that's the individual virtual machine.\n\n531\n00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:54.630\nI mentioned the network switches.\n\n532\n00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:58.425\nIf I go back up here to the server\nsettings, to the host settings,\n\n533\n00:26:58.425 --> 00:27:02.508\nI'll see I've got a virtual SAN manager,\na virtual switch manager.\n\n534\n00:27:02.508 --> 00:27:05.788\nAnd if I go into the virtual switch\nmanager that's where I'm gonna see those\n\n535\n00:27:05.788 --> 00:27:06.740\nnetworks.\n\n536\n00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.790\nAnd the network I've plugged into is this\nLAN management network and you'll see\n\n537\n00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:14.050\nwhere it's bonded to a physical adapter\nthat gives it access to our main network.\n\n538\n00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:16.470\nBut, some of these other\nones like the internal one\n\n539\n00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:19.400\nisn't connected to an adapter at all,\nit's just internal.\n\n540\n00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.353\nOnly machines on an internal network will\nbe able to see each other and the host.\n\n541\n00:27:23.353 --> 00:27:26.100\nAnd you might want to go private\nwhere they can't even see the host,\n\n542\n00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.950\njust the virtual machines see each other.\n\n543\n00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.640\nWe've got those options for tweaking and\n\n544\n00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.285\nadjusting, and\nit's really like adjusting real hardware.\n\n545\n00:27:32.285 --> 00:27:34.880\nYou just wanna make sure\nyou don't oversubscribe.\n\n546\n00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.880\nThe only hardware I didn't\nmention was video and\n\n547\n00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.400\nthat's because on servers we\ndon't normally care about video.\n\n548\n00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.240\nBut if you're bringing up somebody's\ndesktop as a virtual machine and\n\n549\n00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.240\nmaybe they have a thin client,\nthey connect to it.\n\n550\n00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.650\nYou might want it to have\na little bit fancier graphics.\n\n551\n00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.580\nSo when you create a virtual machine,\n\n552\n00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.420\nmost of the virtualization platforms\nout there have where you can adjust\n\n553\n00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:55.570\nthe display settings to be\nable to get optimized output.\n\n554\n00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.930\nAnd this is our server that I'm on here.\n\n555\n00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:01.720\nSo it's got an integrated Intel\nvideo adaptor, so I can't do much.\n\n556\n00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.740\nBut if you look,\nsee how under selected devices,\n\n557\n00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.660\nI've got RemoteFX 3D Video Adaptor?\n\n558\n00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:12.660\nIf I had an NVIDIA video card in this\nserver, like a nicer graphics adaptor,\n\n559\n00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.800\nI could actually enable 3D graphics\neffects inside of the virtual machine.\n\n560\n00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.290\nSo now they get a more\ndesktop type experience.\n\n561\n00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:20.830\nWe don't need that in a server, but\n\n562\n00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:24.110\nthose video options are available if\nyou're running desktops in there.\n\n563\n00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:27.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I was gonna ask\nbecause I know that when we broke\n\n564\n00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.730\nopen the server, you mentioned how\nwe typically don't have video cards,\n\n565\n00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:35.320\ngraphics cards in these servers\nbecause we don't care about video.\n\n566\n00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.950\nSo you can't get grape\njuice from an orange.\n\n567\n00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.310\nHow does that actually work?\n\n568\n00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:43.060\nIf you don't have stuff in here you're not\nreally getting video acceleration unless\n\n569\n00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.160\nyou add that, right?\n\n570\n00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.850\n&gt;&gt; Right, you'd have to say like hey,\nI need this.\n\n571\n00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:48.970\nSo I'm gonna buy the hardware\nthat supports it.\n\n572\n00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:52.720\nSo when I buy a server I also need\nto buy the appropriate graphics card\n\n573\n00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.250\nto pop in there and enable those features.\n\n574\n00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.430\nSome systems, like VMware, they'll\nactually allow you to enable it even\n\n575\n00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.110\nwithout a fancy graphics card,\nit just doesn't work very well.\n\n576\n00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.350\nSo you can try.\n\n577\n00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:05.650\nBut you would have to buy the appropriate\nhard ware to support that.\n\n578\n00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:07.500\nIt all comes down to your\nvendor documentation and\n\n579\n00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.380\nunderstanding the requirements\nto deploy a solution.\n\n580\n00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, lot of great information.\n\n581\n00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.250\nAnd I know when it comes\nto virtualization,\n\n582\n00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:15.560\nI know this is a topic you love.\n\n583\n00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.390\nAnd we've just barely\nscratched the surface.\n\n584\n00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:18.630\nThere's a lot out there, Don.\n\n585\n00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:22.790\nBut well, we don't have a lot more that we\ncan talk about in the time that we have.\n\n586\n00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:23.840\nBut before we sign out, Don,\n\n587\n00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.510\ndo you got any additional words you\nmight like to throw to our viewers?\n\n588\n00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:29.670\nIf you wanna learn more about\nvirtualization pick a product.\n\n589\n00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:33.790\nOn ITProTV we have shows on Hyper V and\non VM Ware's ESXI and\n\n590\n00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:35.140\nthe whole V Sphere suite.\n\n591\n00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.260\nWe have shows on Citrix Xen Server.\n\n592\n00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.360\nThere's a ton of them out there.\n\n593\n00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.570\nThey all work great.\n\n594\n00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.660\nBut they all implement things\na little differently so\n\n595\n00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.150\nyou kinda have to learn\nthe individual products.\n\n596\n00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:46.150\nThat's why CompTIA doesn't really\nharp on a particular product.\n\n597\n00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:48.620\nThey try and stay vendor neutral\ncuz it's just too different.\n\n598\n00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.410\nBut get out there and learn them.\n\n599\n00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.410\nIf you aren't using them already,\nyou should be.\n\n600\n00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.380\nPretty much everything's\nmoved in this direction.\n\n601\n00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.630\nVirtualization is a great solution and\nthen make sure that you get to take\n\n602\n00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:59.790\nfull advantage of the hardware\nthat you've paid for.\n\n603\n00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:02.610\n&gt;&gt; Don, well great information,\nthanks for being here and joining us.\n\n604\n00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:04.000\nThank you, the viewer watching.\n\n605\n00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.396\nSigning out for IT ProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n606\n00:30:07.396 --> 00:30:08.200\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n607\n00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.307\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n608\n00:30:10.307 --> 00:30:16.262\n[MUSIC]\n\n609\n00:30:16.262 --> 00:30:19.563\nThank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.418\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.418 --> 00:00:12.291\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:12.800\n&gt;&gt; Hello and\n\n6\n00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.122\nwelcome to another great episode here at\nITProTV, I'm your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n7\n00:00:17.122 --> 00:00:21.463\nin today's episode we are continuing\nthrough our series in Comp TS Server Plus.\n\n8\n00:00:21.463 --> 00:00:23.080\nAnd joining us back in the studios for\n\n9\n00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.483\nthis endeavor is none other than\nMr Don Pezet, Don, how are you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:26.483 --> 00:00:29.908\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes, ready to\nkick off our great storage adventure.\n\n11\n00:00:29.908 --> 00:00:33.366\n[LAUGH] In the next couple episodes we're\ngonna be taking a look at storage inside\n\n12\n00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:37.085\nof Server Solutions, and it's actually\na pretty important section because storage\n\n13\n00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:39.530\nis typically the bottleneck\nin most server solutions.\n\n14\n00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.805\nIf you look at all the different\ntypes of technologies that we have,\n\n15\n00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:46.079\ninside of a server the storage is\ntypically the slowest component,\n\n16\n00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.176\nespecially if we still have spinning disks\nin your server, which a lot of people do.\n\n17\n00:00:50.176 --> 00:00:52.631\nThat's a physical,\nspinning piece of equipment,\n\n18\n00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:54.303\nthat means you've got a motor, and\n\n19\n00:00:54.303 --> 00:00:58.058\nthat's gonna be slower than any electric\nto electric communication you have.\n\n20\n00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:01.516\nThings like RAM and solid state drives,\nthey're gonna be way faster.\n\n21\n00:01:01.516 --> 00:01:04.673\nSo as we design our servers, understanding\nstorage is pretty important and\n\n22\n00:01:04.673 --> 00:01:07.400\nwe're gonna look at all the options\nin how we make that decision.\n\n23\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.094\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\nI just grabbed your credit card.\n\n24\n00:01:10.094 --> 00:01:11.501\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'm going out and\n\n25\n00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:15.805\nI'm gonna buy something at Newegg or\nAmazon, what are the considerations that I\n\n26\n00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:20.106\nhave to look at when I'm gonna say, okay,\nthis drive is better than this drive,\n\n27\n00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:23.044\nmaybe I'll use this one,\nmaybe I won't use that one?\n\n28\n00:01:23.044 --> 00:01:25.257\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nnot all drives are created equal,\n\n29\n00:01:25.257 --> 00:01:28.493\nthere are several different types\nof drives that are out there, and\n\n30\n00:01:28.493 --> 00:01:32.610\neven drives that look identical, don't\nalways have the same performance profile.\n\n31\n00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.112\nSo unfortunately, rule number one here\nis you're going to have to read, and\n\n32\n00:01:37.112 --> 00:01:39.204\nyou're going to have to read a lot.\n\n33\n00:01:39.204 --> 00:01:43.268\nWhen you build out a server, or spec out a\nserver, and someone else builds it, Dell,\n\n34\n00:01:43.268 --> 00:01:46.655\nLenovo, or whoever, when you go to\nspec out what you need for a server,\n\n35\n00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:49.931\nyou need to understand the performance\nprofile of your software, so\n\n36\n00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:52.667\nwhat is the software you are running and\nwhat do you need?\n\n37\n00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:54.384\nIf I have a database server,\n\n38\n00:01:54.384 --> 00:01:58.833\nI know I'm going to be doing a lot of\nrandom reads off of those hard drives.\n\n39\n00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:00.753\nI'm going to get a query, and\nI've got to find data, and\n\n40\n00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:02.361\nthe data could be anywhere\ninside of that file.\n\n41\n00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:06.173\nI need to be able to jump around\nthe database and read different things.\n\n42\n00:02:06.173 --> 00:02:10.025\nVersus, like a backup server, where\nI know that if I'm restoring backups,\n\n43\n00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:13.761\nI'm gonna start from the beginning of\nthe backup, and I'm just gonna read\n\n44\n00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:18.174\nall the way through sequentially, nice and\nin order, there's no random seqs on that.\n\n45\n00:02:18.174 --> 00:02:21.721\nSo things like seq time,\ndon't matter so much in that scenario,\n\n46\n00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:25.078\nversus seq time really does\nmatter in the database solution.\n\n47\n00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.706\nSo, we need to know the characteristics\nof our software, so\n\n48\n00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:30.243\nwe can make sure that we buy\nthe hardware that aligns to it.\n\n49\n00:02:30.243 --> 00:02:32.864\nAnd even when we get a hardware\nthat appears identical,\n\n50\n00:02:32.864 --> 00:02:35.487\nit doesn't always have\nthe same performance profile,\n\n51\n00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:39.525\nso, we need to understand how these things\nfunction, what they do and how they vary.\n\n52\n00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:42.337\nSo, we're gonna run through a couple\nof examples of that and how we pick.\n\n53\n00:02:42.337 --> 00:02:45.026\nA lot of people just fixate\non the speed of the disk, and\n\n54\n00:02:45.026 --> 00:02:49.298\nthat's not always accurate because there's\nseveral different things that fall into\n\n55\n00:02:49.298 --> 00:02:53.299\nthe mix, and we will talk about each of\nthose as this episode kind of moves along.\n\n56\n00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.745\nAll right, let's start though\njust by demonstrating how there\n\n57\n00:02:57.745 --> 00:03:02.036\nare differences between even\nidentical appearing systems.\n\n58\n00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:04.999\nSo, I've got our virtualization\nserver pulled up here,\n\n59\n00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:08.867\nthis is one that we use in a lot of shows\nthat we run our virtual machines from,\n\n60\n00:03:08.867 --> 00:03:12.917\nit's running Windows Server 2016,\nit's got an Intel i7 processor, and\n\n61\n00:03:12.917 --> 00:03:16.389\nit's a pretty fast machine, and\nit's got a rate controller in it.\n\n62\n00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.719\nAnd on that rate controller, we have two\ndifferent arrays available for virtual\n\n63\n00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:25.254\nmachine storage, and the two arrays are\nactually configured, the same exact way.\n\n64\n00:03:25.254 --> 00:03:30.136\nIf I pull up those drives,\nwhat I'll see in here,\n\n65\n00:03:30.136 --> 00:03:34.902\nif I go into my system,\nis I've got two stripes,\n\n66\n00:03:34.902 --> 00:03:39.582\nand they're both 1.81 terabytes, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:39.582 --> 00:03:43.465\nWhat they are are two RAID zero stripes,\nin that they're two terabyte drives, but\n\n68\n00:03:43.465 --> 00:03:46.907\nwe'll talk about the mathematics of\nhard drives in another episode, but\n\n69\n00:03:46.907 --> 00:03:49.983\nyou actually end up with about\n1.8 terabytes of usable space.\n\n70\n00:03:49.983 --> 00:03:54.568\nSo I have two Seagate hard drives\nthat are one terabyte each, and two\n\n71\n00:03:54.568 --> 00:04:00.369\nWestern Digital Black drives that are one\nterabyte each, and the RAID zero stripes.\n\n72\n00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:04.553\nNow, RAID zero will typically give you the\nbest performance, there's no redundancy,\n\n73\n00:04:04.553 --> 00:04:06.172\nthere's no parity calculation,\n\n74\n00:04:06.172 --> 00:04:09.206\nthere's no mirroring,\nwe break our data up across two drives.\n\n75\n00:04:09.206 --> 00:04:12.161\nSo when I read and write on the Black\nstripe here, I'm reading and\n\n76\n00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:15.625\nwriting from two drives at the same time,\nI should get double performance.\n\n77\n00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:18.309\nSame thing with the Seagate stripe here,\nI'm reading and\n\n78\n00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:21.835\nwriting from two drives at the same time,\nI should get double performance.\n\n79\n00:04:21.835 --> 00:04:26.508\nBoth of these are built up with 7,200\nRPM drives, and both of these are sata 6\n\n80\n00:04:26.508 --> 00:04:29.962\ndrives and they're both run to\nthe same RAID controller, so\n\n81\n00:04:29.962 --> 00:04:32.556\nyou get the same\nperformance profile there.\n\n82\n00:04:32.556 --> 00:04:35.756\nIn theory,\nperformance should be identical.\n\n83\n00:04:35.756 --> 00:04:39.305\nBut different vendors have different\nperformance characteristics, and we may\n\n84\n00:04:39.305 --> 00:04:42.750\nfind that some have better read speeds,\nbetter write speeds, some might have\n\n85\n00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.212\nbetter seek times, some might be newer\nhard drives versus older hard drives.\n\n86\n00:04:46.212 --> 00:04:50.945\nRemember that newer hard drives will\ntypically have more platters in them than\n\n87\n00:04:50.945 --> 00:04:52.168\nolder hard drives.\n\n88\n00:04:52.168 --> 00:04:55.679\nSo when a one terabyte drive first came\nout, I think I said that backwards,\n\n89\n00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:56.250\ndidn't I?\n\n90\n00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.425\nShoot, when a one terabyte drive first\ncame out, it probably had three or\n\n91\n00:04:59.425 --> 00:05:01.831\nfour platters in it, but\nby the time we get to today, and\n\n92\n00:05:01.831 --> 00:05:05.338\none terabyte drives have been out for\nyears, they only have one or two platters.\n\n93\n00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:08.841\nWhich is less ground for us to cover with\nour mechanical arms to get to our data,\n\n94\n00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:12.575\nso, they actually perform a little bit\nfaster even though they're the same size.\n\n95\n00:05:12.575 --> 00:05:15.765\n&gt;&gt; I would imagine that you would put\nmore and more platters in there, Don,\n\n96\n00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:17.396\nwhy are they reducing the platters?\n\n97\n00:05:17.396 --> 00:05:20.566\nIs that because the density of\nthe disk is getting greater?\n\n98\n00:05:20.566 --> 00:05:23.882\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they get more efficient at how\nthey can put that data in there, so\n\n99\n00:05:23.882 --> 00:05:26.869\none terabyte might need four\nplatters when it first starts, but\n\n100\n00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:30.659\nover time they get more efficient, and\nnow one terabyte can fit in two platters.\n\n101\n00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:33.801\nAnd they can still sell four platter\ndrives but now they're two terabytes, or\n\n102\n00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:36.861\nfour terabytes, or eight, as they\nstart growing and growing and growing.\n\n103\n00:05:36.861 --> 00:05:40.436\nThe newest sizes, when those come out,\nusually have the most platters, and\n\n104\n00:05:40.436 --> 00:05:44.011\nthat can result in some performance hits\non those, you get a lot of storage and\n\n105\n00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:45.444\nthe tradeoff is performance.\n\n106\n00:05:45.444 --> 00:05:48.468\nNow, we don't see any of that\nin our operating system, right?\n\n107\n00:05:48.468 --> 00:05:51.711\nThe performance is not really visible\nto us, but there's utilities available,\n\n108\n00:05:51.711 --> 00:05:54.024\nusually built right into the OS,\nwhere you can test that.\n\n109\n00:05:54.024 --> 00:05:56.726\nWindows has a nice one called WinSAT,\nwhich is used for\n\n110\n00:05:56.726 --> 00:05:59.736\ntesting the performance\ncharacteristics of your machine.\n\n111\n00:05:59.736 --> 00:06:03.744\nA lot of video gamers use it because they\nwanna get the best hardware possible, but\n\n112\n00:06:03.744 --> 00:06:07.404\nit works great on servers too because it\ngives me a chance to take a look at how\n\n113\n00:06:07.404 --> 00:06:08.936\nthese drives are performing.\n\n114\n00:06:08.936 --> 00:06:15.287\nSo just so I make sure, I wanna make sure\nthat I'm comparing the right things here,\n\n115\n00:06:15.287 --> 00:06:19.757\nand so I'm gonna be looking\nat these two stripes, right?\n\n116\n00:06:19.757 --> 00:06:25.375\nThe D and E, D is Western Digital Black\nand the Seagate one is E,\n\n117\n00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:30.251\nand I'm gonna run a quick test,\nI'm gonna do WinSAT,\n\n118\n00:06:30.251 --> 00:06:33.859\nand I'm gonna run a disk test on drive D.\n\n119\n00:06:33.859 --> 00:06:36.372\nSo, I'm gonna test that\nWestern Digital drive and\n\n120\n00:06:36.372 --> 00:06:38.191\nsee what it's performance is like.\n\n121\n00:06:38.191 --> 00:06:41.961\nAnd so this is gonna run a series of\ntests, and it's testing the read speed and\n\n122\n00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:46.021\nthe write speed, and while I'm waiting on\nthat to run, let me change my font here so\n\n123\n00:06:46.021 --> 00:06:48.069\nit's a little bit easier to see all this.\n\n124\n00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:52.079\nI'm going to bump up my size,\nand my color, there we go,\n\n125\n00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:55.184\nthat'll be a littler easier to read for\nus.\n\n126\n00:06:55.184 --> 00:06:59.993\nAnd so here it's going, see, it ran some\nread tests and a write test, and now it's\n\n127\n00:06:59.993 --> 00:07:04.693\ndoing some queries, looking around,\ndoing sequenced reads and random reads.\n\n128\n00:07:04.693 --> 00:07:08.853\nSequential reads are all right in an\norder, so it's reading a bunch of data in\n\n129\n00:07:08.853 --> 00:07:12.757\na line, and then random reads,\nwhere it's jumping all over the drive,\n\n130\n00:07:12.757 --> 00:07:16.804\nthat's a great way to see seek time,\nand when it's done, I get an output.\n\n131\n00:07:16.804 --> 00:07:21.829\nAnd I can see that, as far as the random\nreads, it randomly, in the amount\n\n132\n00:07:21.829 --> 00:07:27.178\nof time the test ran, it was able to\nrandomly pull 1.74 megabytes of data,\n\n133\n00:07:27.178 --> 00:07:31.821\nit was able to sequentially pull\n181 megabytes of data on a read.\n\n134\n00:07:31.821 --> 00:07:33.590\nThat's a huge difference, and\n\n135\n00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.546\nthe difference here is these\nare mechanical drives.\n\n136\n00:07:36.546 --> 00:07:40.576\nMechanical drives have an arm that\nhas to move to get to a location.\n\n137\n00:07:40.576 --> 00:07:44.973\nWhen the arm is always running in the same\nlocation, it can pull a lot of data, but\n\n138\n00:07:44.973 --> 00:07:48.740\nwhen it's jumping around the drive,\nlook how much we lost, right?\n\n139\n00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.410\nAnd it's an 100% difference between, or\nno, ten times, ten times the difference,\n\n140\n00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.992\nwhich, I don't know,\nwhatever, stupid math,\n\n141\n00:07:55.992 --> 00:07:59.817\nbut ten times the difference between\nrandom versus sequential, right?\n\n142\n00:07:59.817 --> 00:08:02.107\nSo if I understand\nthe characteristic of my server.\n\n143\n00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:04.690\nAnd I know my server's doing sequential,\nI might be okay with that.\n\n144\n00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.660\nBut if I know I need random, that might\nbe a problem for me that's a big hit.\n\n145\n00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.780\nWell, let's run that same\ntest on the Seagate drives.\n\n146\n00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.280\nNow I said the Seagate\ndrives are identical.\n\n147\n00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.950\nThey have the same the RPMs.\n\n148\n00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.510\nThey have the same interface.\n\n149\n00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.580\nThey're configured in the same RAID array,\nthey're using the same RAID controller.\n\n150\n00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.670\nAnd I'm running the test separately,\nnot at the same time.\n\n151\n00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.800\nSo I'm not getting contention there.\n\n152\n00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.440\nSo in theory I should get\nthe same numbers, right?\n\n153\n00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.170\nWell, what you'll find is the Seagate\ndrives will be better in some areas and\n\n154\n00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:33.080\nworse in others.\n\n155\n00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.890\nAnd the Western Digital drives will be\nbetter in some areas and worse in others.\n\n156\n00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.000\nBut they each have different\nareas where they excel.\n\n157\n00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.510\nAnd so it's running that same basic test.\n\n158\n00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.320\nAnd I'll be able to compare the numbers\nbetween the two and see how that looks.\n\n159\n00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.710\nNow, both of these tests are being\ndone with mechanical drives.\n\n160\n00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.350\nPlatters that spin and\narms that move to read the data.\n\n161\n00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.800\nAnd that's gonna impact things,\nhere we go, my random reads.\n\n162\n00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.870\nThe Western Digitals were able to\npull 1.47 megabytes, the Seagate?\n\n163\n00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:03.460\nOnly 1.33, right, it was able to\npull less data with the random.\n\n164\n00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.530\nBut on the sequential,\n\n165\n00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:09.890\n333 megabytes versus up here\nwhere my sequential was only 181.\n\n166\n00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:15.520\nSo my Seagate drives did better\nwith sequential data, than random.\n\n167\n00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.890\nAnd my Western Digital drive did\nbetter with random than sequential.\n\n168\n00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.320\nSee how they each kind of\nexcel in a different area.\n\n169\n00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.330\nThat's what makes choosing\nhard drives really difficult,\n\n170\n00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.000\nis we need to understand what our software\nneeds and what our software does.\n\n171\n00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.640\nAnd we need to understand\nhow the drives excel.\n\n172\n00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.150\nAnd when you pull the technical\nspecifications for the drive,\n\n173\n00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.590\nthat's where you find it.\n\n174\n00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.010\n&gt;&gt; And when you say the software,\n\n175\n00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:40.490\nand I'm reading the documentation,\nDon there's not, again, one size fits all.\n\n176\n00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.400\nDifferent software would need to\nutilize different attributes here\n\n177\n00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.075\nthat we're seeing,\nas far as these numbers?\n\n178\n00:09:45.075 --> 00:09:46.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nhopefully the vendors can help you out.\n\n179\n00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.500\nI'm kind of cheating here,\nbecause I've got the drives in my hand.\n\n180\n00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.670\nBut if you're trying to buy these,\nyou don't have them in your hand,\n\n181\n00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:52.670\nyou can't test them.\n\n182\n00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.480\nSo you rely on the vendor's documentation\nof the hard drives as far as their\n\n183\n00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.490\nspecifications.\n\n184\n00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.410\nAnd then you rely on the vendor of\nyour application software software\n\n185\n00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.075\nto tell you the performance\ncharacteristics of that.\n\n186\n00:10:02.075 --> 00:10:04.540\nAnd once you get it in hand\nthen you can test it and\n\n187\n00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.269\nmake sure the decisions were correct,\nbut know that sometimes they aren't.\n\n188\n00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:10.898\nSometimes, believe it or not, salespeople\ngive us inaccurate information and\n\n189\n00:10:10.898 --> 00:10:12.950\nnow we've speced our server incorrectly.\n\n190\n00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.390\nNow, these were done\nwith mechanical drives.\n\n191\n00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.890\nMechanical drives are the most\ncommon right now, but\n\n192\n00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.990\nthey're quickly being replaced\nby solid state drives.\n\n193\n00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.920\nAnd the main reason is how they function.\n\n194\n00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.460\nAnd I've got examples of both\nright here on the table with me.\n\n195\n00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.840\nI've got one mechanical drive here which\nis appropriately labeled BAD number one.\n\n196\n00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.900\nIt's a bad drive because\nI'm about to tear it open.\n\n197\n00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.070\nThe moment you open a drive it ruins it,\nso I'm gonna use this one here.\n\n198\n00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:40.050\nThis is a mechanical drive, it's big,\nit's heavy, right, it's thick.\n\n199\n00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.802\nAnd that's because inside\nit has a spinning platter,\n\n200\n00:10:42.802 --> 00:10:46.910\nit actually has a device that's\ngoing to move around inside of it.\n\n201\n00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:51.110\nAnd if we were to open that up, I'm just\ngoing to grab a tool out of the tool kit\n\n202\n00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.060\nhere and we'll open that drive up.\n\n203\n00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.720\nAnd what you're gonna see are round\nplatters with a mechanical\n\n204\n00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.300\narm that spins around inside\nof it to get to the data.\n\n205\n00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.140\nHere we go, so what we're seeing is this\nround platter is where the data is stored.\n\n206\n00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.560\nAnd there's actually\nmore than one platter.\n\n207\n00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.060\nIf you were to look inside,\nyou'll see there's three\n\n208\n00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.780\nplatters stacked on top of each other,\nand that means there's three arms.\n\n209\n00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.890\nBut the arms are all attached together and\n\n210\n00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.640\nthe arms can only be in\none place at a time.\n\n211\n00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.250\nSo when it's here,\nit can read data three layers deep but\n\n212\n00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.950\nalways from that one place.\n\n213\n00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.890\nIf I do a random seek,\nthe drive has to spin.\n\n214\n00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.620\nThat makes a nice grinding noise,\nthe drive has to spin and\n\n215\n00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:35.020\nthe arm has to move to get to where\nthat data is and it takes time.\n\n216\n00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.100\nIt's a mechancal operation,\nI've got moving parts.\n\n217\n00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:42.940\nI'm dependent on how fast the drives can\nspin and how fast that arm can move.\n\n218\n00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:47.540\nThat's impacting my sync time, and my\nread time, even the sequential read time.\n\n219\n00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.120\nBecause I can only read it as\nfast as these disks are spinning,\n\n220\n00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.150\nthat's impacting how this drive works.\n\n221\n00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.110\nSo that's how a mechanical\nspinning disk works.\n\n222\n00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.260\nThese are the common ones we see.\n\n223\n00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.950\nWe get the highest capacity and\nthe lowest cost.\n\n224\n00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.140\nBut they're being replaced\nby solid-state drives.\n\n225\n00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:07.310\nDrives that look like this, which is\nfar less exciting, and it's very thin.\n\n226\n00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:11.430\nAnd if I were to crack open this case,\nthe disk inside,\n\n227\n00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.890\nit's not even filling up this whole area.\n\n228\n00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.650\nIt's actually just filling up a small\nlittle piece down here at the end,\n\n229\n00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.000\nbecause it's just\na couple of memory chips.\n\n230\n00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.380\nSolid state drives use\nmemory that you can write,\n\n231\n00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.870\njust like RAM,\nexcept that it is persistent.\n\n232\n00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.620\nSo, when I cut power to it, I don't\nlose it, like I do with RAM, right?\n\n233\n00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.780\nI'm writing with flash memory, and\nyou can read or write to it very fast.\n\n234\n00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.150\nAnd the way they really\nexcel are the random reads.\n\n235\n00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.260\nBecause I don't have to spin a disc or\n\n236\n00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.940\nmove an arm to get to a particular\nsector of a memory chip.\n\n237\n00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.120\nI just go and\nget from that other memory chip.\n\n238\n00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.270\nAnd that makes it way faster,\nbut way more expensive.\n\n239\n00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.200\nYou can usually get about half\nthe storage on an SSD that you could for\n\n240\n00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.280\nthe same price with a spinning disk,\nbut it's way faster.\n\n241\n00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.030\nIf I rerun that same test,\nwe'll see a big difference.\n\n242\n00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:03.090\n&gt;&gt; Don, one of the things that I notice\nright away with these drives is that\n\n243\n00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.528\nthey have two different form factors.\n\n244\n00:13:05.528 --> 00:13:08.410\nCan you tell us a little bit about\nthe different types of form factors\n\n245\n00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:09.290\nthat we might see?\n\n246\n00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:13.380\n&gt;&gt; Sure, I'm starting that hard drive test\non my C drive which is on a flash drive.\n\n247\n00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.200\nAnd then, I was gonna talk about\nthe form factors while I waited, but\n\n248\n00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.070\nit actually finished fast enough.\n\n249\n00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.030\nSo let me talk about these numbers real\nquick and then we'll do the form factors.\n\n250\n00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:24.870\nI ran it, and first off, you'll notice\nthe test finished way faster on the SSD,\n\n251\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.520\nit ran really fast.\n\n252\n00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.110\nAnd when the numbers came back,\nthese are huge differences, right.\n\n253\n00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.250\nI got 478 MB on the random reads.\n\n254\n00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:38.670\nWhereas on this Western Digital,\nI was only getting 147.\n\n255\n00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:42.930\nHuge difference on these sequential reads,\n528, big difference.\n\n256\n00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:47.150\nAnd when we start looking at the average\nread time and latency and so\n\n257\n00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:51.920\non, the latency on my other drives,\nright latency is when I sent a request to\n\n258\n00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.660\nthe drive for data how long does it take\nto get back to me with the data right,\n\n259\n00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.120\nwhat's that whole trip.\n\n260\n00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:01.180\nAnd on the Western Digital Drive\nmy latency was 18 milliseconds.\n\n261\n00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:06.430\nAnd then when I got to the c gate\nmy average latency 25 milliseconds,\n\n262\n00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.230\na little longer, right?\n\n263\n00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:14.670\nWhen I get down to the SSD,\nmy average latency was 0.3 milliseconds.\n\n264\n00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.560\nSignificantly faster, right,\n\n265\n00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.110\nthat's the advantage of getting\nrid of that moving arm.\n\n266\n00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.750\nThe other thing is failure,\nwhen you have moving parts,\n\n267\n00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.790\nthey tend to fail, regular hard drives\nrarely last more than three years.\n\n268\n00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.010\nBut an SSD can go way longer than that.\n\n269\n00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.460\nIn fact, the only thing that\nshortens the lifetime of an SSD,\n\n270\n00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.990\nis how many writes you do to it.\n\n271\n00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.990\nYou can usually only write to them so\nmany times, it's typically in the tens of\n\n272\n00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.050\nthousands, if not in the hundreds of\nthousands times before you get failure.\n\n273\n00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:41.250\nBut that's really what\nlimits their lifetime.\n\n274\n00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.330\nSpinning disks,\nthey're limited by their motor.\n\n275\n00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.640\nTheir motor will die out usually\nwithin three to five years.\n\n276\n00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.450\nOn a server, you never take drivers beyond\nthree years, because you can't trust them.\n\n277\n00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.240\nAnd you've got a service level you need to\nmaintain, you don't want to trust that.\n\n278\n00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.320\nAll right, so we see where SSD\nbecomes really beneficial.\n\n279\n00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.640\nIt really improves a lot of\nthe characteristics of the drive and\n\n280\n00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.960\nthat's where we want to get to.\n\n281\n00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.060\nThe negatives of SSD are cost,\nas well as temperature.\n\n282\n00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.190\nThey're memory chips, and\nas you're reading and writing from them,\n\n283\n00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:08.810\nthey generate heat.\n\n284\n00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.650\nThey usually generate a little bit of\nheat that can exceed what drives do.\n\n285\n00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:15.720\nBut honestly, when you get spinning disks,\npeople are normally getting 10,000, and\n\n286\n00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.000\n50,000 RPM drives,\nwhich are really hot also.\n\n287\n00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.760\nSo heat's gonna be\na problem no matter what.\n\n288\n00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.580\nAnd we're starting to see\nservers move over to SSDs.\n\n289\n00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.513\nAmazon Web Services,\n\n290\n00:15:23.513 --> 00:15:26.680\nthey moved almost all of their data\ncenters over to SSD at this point.\n\n291\n00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.530\nIt's the way companies are going,\nso that's what we're gonna see.\n\n292\n00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.710\nOn the form factor side, you guys\nsaw on my spinning disc over here.\n\n293\n00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.250\nIt's pretty darn big,\nit's 3.5 inches across.\n\n294\n00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.780\nIt's a pretty wide disc, and it's very\nthick to accommodate the platters and\n\n295\n00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.520\nthe moving arm and\nall the different components inside it.\n\n296\n00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.680\nIt's big, but when we get to SSD,\nit can be really really small.\n\n297\n00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.344\nThey've chosen to follow\nthe laptop form factor.\n\n298\n00:15:52.344 --> 00:15:57.054\nLaptops hard drives are 2.5 and they are\nvery thin because laptops are portable,\n\n299\n00:15:57.054 --> 00:16:00.766\nare designed to be smaller So\nhere the memory chip is even smaller,\n\n300\n00:16:00.766 --> 00:16:01.985\nreally tiny in here.\n\n301\n00:16:01.985 --> 00:16:04.150\nBut they fill it up\nwith empty case just so\n\n302\n00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.480\nit fits in standard laptop compartments.\n\n303\n00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.980\nBut same things goes for servers,\ntoo, if you've got servers with\n\n304\n00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.780\nhot swappable drives, you need to have\na way that you can grab onto the drive and\n\n305\n00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.240\npull it out of the front the system.\n\n306\n00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.460\nIf it's a tiny little chip,\n\n307\n00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.520\nthat's really hard to do without shorting\nout the motherboard or something.\n\n308\n00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.740\nBut if they put it in a case like this,\nit's easier to grab and pull out so\n\n309\n00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.320\nthey follow that form factor.\n\n310\n00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.160\nSo we've got the older 3.5 inch style and\n\n311\n00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.370\nthe newer 2.5 inch that you're\nseeing almost every disk move to.\n\n312\n00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.750\nWhere it gets confusing is sometimes you\nget a 2.5 inch disk like this one and\n\n313\n00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.440\nyou don't necessarily know\nif it's spinning or SSD.\n\n314\n00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.220\nIt's usually written on there,\nbut if it's spinning,\n\n315\n00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.620\nthere will be at least one air hole on it.\n\n316\n00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.570\nThere's always a little air hole because\nof the pressure that can build up inside\n\n317\n00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:46.190\nof them.\n\n318\n00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:50.000\nAnd there will usually be at least one\nbig screw in the middle which is what's\n\n319\n00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.910\ncentering up the platters and\nstabilizing them.\n\n320\n00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.440\nCuz otherwise the platters can shake and\n\n321\n00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.250\nthat'll immediately ruin a disk,\nthey have to have stabilizers.\n\n322\n00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.640\nAll that stuff we don't need in SSD,\nright?\n\n323\n00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.630\nAll more the reason we\nneed to get over SSD.\n\n324\n00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:07.010\nAll right, so we've seen some differences\nthere as far as SSD versus spinning and\n\n325\n00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.270\nsome of the other characteristics.\n\n326\n00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:09.480\nWhen you go to buy a disk,\n\n327\n00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.060\nthere's a lot of things you\nhave to think about, all right.\n\n328\n00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.468\nRPM, rotations per minute, if it's a\nspinning disk, how fast do the disks spin?\n\n329\n00:17:15.468 --> 00:17:19.610\nYour average off the shelf consumer drive\nis 5,400 rotations per minute, rpms,\n\n330\n00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:21.720\n5,400 rpm, and that's pretty slow.\n\n331\n00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:26.320\nYou can get nicer ones at 7,200 rpm, but\n\n332\n00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.230\nin the server world, we're normally\ngetting 10,000 or 15,000 rpms.\n\n333\n00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.360\nIf you have a 15,000 rpm drive,\n\n334\n00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.870\nit's gonna get three times the speed\nof a regular consumer hard drive.\n\n335\n00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.520\nThat means it can get to data a lot\nfaster, a lot more expensive, but\n\n336\n00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.000\nit can get there a lot faster.\n\n337\n00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.360\nSSD is still gonna be\nfaster than that though so\n\n338\n00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.250\nthat's usually the route\nwe're gonna follow.\n\n339\n00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:49.160\n&gt;&gt; Don, when you stack a bank\nof these 15,000 RPM drives,\n\n340\n00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.820\ndo you also have to consider cooling\nas you add these drives as well?\n\n341\n00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.140\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and your servers\nare designed to do that, right?\n\n342\n00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.820\nYour servers should have a bank\nof fans on the back of the drives\n\n343\n00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:58.700\nthat are handling that.\n\n344\n00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.500\nIf you go back and\nwatch our server components episode,\n\n345\n00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.360\nwe took that one apart.\n\n346\n00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.570\nYou'll remember there were eight\nfans stacked right behind, and\n\n347\n00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.280\nthat was just for four hard drives, right?\n\n348\n00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.780\nSo it was already designed to be able\nto cool the heat moving through it.\n\n349\n00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.880\nWe also have our dimensions in form\nfactor, when you buy a server,\n\n350\n00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.000\nit may be rigged for\n3.5 inch drives, or 2.5 inch drives.\n\n351\n00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.319\nThe server I took apart on the show\nwas rigged for 3.5 inch drives, for\n\n352\n00:18:20.319 --> 00:18:22.070\nthe larger form factor.\n\n353\n00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.350\nYou've got capacity,\nwe always have to worry about that.\n\n354\n00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.020\nHow much storage do we need?\n\n355\n00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.440\nTerabyte drives are very common, but\nfor performance reasons we might\n\n356\n00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.960\nwant to have more smaller drives\nthan fewer large drives, right?\n\n357\n00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.880\nAlso something to consider, the bus width,\nI'm going to hold off on that one and\n\n358\n00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.750\ntalk about it in just a moment because\nthere are several different bus widths.\n\n359\n00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:44.610\nJust because your drive says that\nit's a SAI or SAS or SCSI driver,\n\n360\n00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:48.130\nwhatever, there's also the matter of how\nmuch data you can get into and out of it.\n\n361\n00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.280\nAnd so that's where our bus width\ncomes in, I'll cover that in a moment.\n\n362\n00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.330\nIOPS, IOPS are really important.\n\n363\n00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:58.100\nIOPS or IOPS,\nit's input output per second.\n\n364\n00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.550\nHow many input and output operations\ncan we perform per second?\n\n365\n00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.860\nIf I send a bunch of reads or a bunch of\nwrites, how many can I do per second?\n\n366\n00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.770\nDifferent drives have different\nperformance profiles and\n\n367\n00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.280\nthat's usually all we care about, it's how\nmuch can I do in a given period of time,\n\n368\n00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.940\nespecially on database servers.\n\n369\n00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.000\nIf you use a Cloud service like AWS or\n\n370\n00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.040\nMicrosoft Azure, when you buy your\nstorage, you'll build based on your IOPS.\n\n371\n00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:24.220\nAre you doing 10,000 IOPS, 10,000\ninput and outputs per second, or not?\n\n372\n00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.310\nAnd if you need more than 10,000,\n\n373\n00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.490\nyou gotta pay extra to get\nthe faster drives and faster access.\n\n374\n00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:31.080\nOn your local system,\nyou might just use that as your metric for\n\n375\n00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.370\nmeasuring whether performance\nis where it needs to be.\n\n376\n00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:38.180\nSeek time and latency, we kind of saw a\nmoment ago, when I ran those drive tests.\n\n377\n00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:42.910\nSeek time, how long does it take to\nget to a particular spot on the disc?\n\n378\n00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.500\nAnd then latency,\nfrom the moment I send the request,\n\n379\n00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.300\nhow long does it take to\nget the data back to me?\n\n380\n00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:52.340\nAnd, the vendors, the people who\nmanufacture the stuff, Western Digital,\n\n381\n00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.290\nSeagate, Toshiba,\nthey all tell you numbers, like yeah,\n\n382\n00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:56.800\nhere's how long it'll be.\n\n383\n00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.620\nDon't trust them because once you, they're\nlying, they did it in lab conditions.\n\n384\n00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.820\nWhen you get it into your environment,\n\n385\n00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.650\nit'll probably be different because of\nthe characteristics of your system.\n\n386\n00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:09.110\nSo always remeasure and\nmake sure you document that.\n\n387\n00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.660\nAnd then hot swap versus non hot swap.\n\n388\n00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.060\nThis used to be a big problem, because in\nthe older standards you didn't have hot\n\n389\n00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.160\nswap, unless there was\nspecial hardware for it.\n\n390\n00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.740\nBut in today's world,\nSATA has hot swap built into the protocol,\n\n391\n00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.214\nso any SATA system is\ntechnically a hot swap system.\n\n392\n00:20:23.214 --> 00:20:27.800\nSaaS is the same way, so\nwe kind of have hot swap a lot.\n\n393\n00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.130\nIn most servers,\n\n394\n00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:32.250\nthey'll actually use colored handles\nto denote whether it's hot swap or not.\n\n395\n00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.880\nMost of them are today,\nbut don't just assume.\n\n396\n00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.690\nYou never wanna yank a spinning\ndisk out of a system,\n\n397\n00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.310\nit'll really cause some trouble.\n\n398\n00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.370\nIt's always better to do it offline if you\ncan, but if the server needs to be online,\n\n399\n00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:43.300\ncheck your documentation.\n\n400\n00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.070\nYou may be able to do hot swap online.\n\n401\n00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:47.750\n&gt;&gt; Don, you've mentioned a couple\nof terms already in this episode,\n\n402\n00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:50.300\nbut tell me a little bit about\nthe connections themselves.\n\n403\n00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.630\nWhat kind of connections do we use\ninside of our drives technologies?\n\n404\n00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.680\nI know there's a slew of them out there,\nbut\n\n405\n00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.860\nwhat are we looking at when it\ncomes to our modern servers today?\n\n406\n00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.890\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nthis is where we get into our bus types.\n\n407\n00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:04.390\nThere's different disc types\nthat are out there and\n\n408\n00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.010\neach one has a different\nfamily that it's a part of.\n\n409\n00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.830\nAnd the family determines the connector.\n\n410\n00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:13.835\nAnd so the main ones that we see\ntoday are traditional SCSI disks,\n\n411\n00:21:13.835 --> 00:21:19.760\nSATA disks, serial taskers, your SaaS\ndisks and then fiber channel disks.\n\n412\n00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.665\nThose are the kind of the four\nstandard that we see in servers.\n\n413\n00:21:22.665 --> 00:21:24.785\nAnd within each standard\nyou have different speeds.\n\n414\n00:21:24.785 --> 00:21:27.778\nSo I made a little table before the show,\nand Les helped me with it,\n\n415\n00:21:27.778 --> 00:21:31.305\nbecause he's the infinite\nof memorizing numbers.\n\n416\n00:21:31.305 --> 00:21:34.375\nBut I listed some of the drives\nyou're going to see on servers today.\n\n417\n00:21:34.375 --> 00:21:36.905\nThere's plenty of other\nstandards that are out there.\n\n418\n00:21:36.905 --> 00:21:39.575\nAnd if you're still using them,\nyour server should be in a museum.\n\n419\n00:21:39.575 --> 00:21:42.395\nThese are the only ones that I can think\nof that would possibly be in production\n\n420\n00:21:42.395 --> 00:21:43.892\nat this moment.\n\n421\n00:21:43.892 --> 00:21:46.880\nSCSI 160 is the oldest of\nthe ones that I've got up here.\n\n422\n00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:51.850\nSCSI is a technology that's been\naround since the 1980s, it gives you\n\n423\n00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:56.270\naddressability for up to 15 drives per\nchannel, or 14 cuz the controller.\n\n424\n00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.040\nAnd then it gives you great\nreliable speeds that were\n\n425\n00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.290\nbetter than the old IDE\ndrives at the time.\n\n426\n00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:04.710\nBut it's largely become outdated, and\nso we don't see it in modern servers.\n\n427\n00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:08.290\nIf you go and buy a server today, I don't\nthink you can buy a server that has SCSI.\n\n428\n00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.520\nBut you might still have\nsome in production, right?\n\n429\n00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.490\nAnd SCSI 160, and ultra SCSI 320\nare the two standards there.\n\n430\n00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:21.990\nThey get 160 megabits, or 320 megabytes,\nsorry, that's important, right?\n\n431\n00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:25.727\nCuz 1 byte is 8 bits, there's a huge\ndifference, so, 160 megabytes or\n\n432\n00:22:25.727 --> 00:22:28.210\n320 megabytes per second.\n\n433\n00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:32.210\nSo if I wanted to move that level of data,\nI could if I had ultra 320 drives,\n\n434\n00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:33.660\nI could move 320 megabytes per second.\n\n435\n00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:38.420\nAnd they sue the traditional\nSCSI connectconnectors\n\n436\n00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.849\nthat would plugin into the back of\nthe trisector, big thick ribbon cables.\n\n437\n00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:45.140\nWell on the lower inside\nwe had SATA drives,\n\n438\n00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.380\nthe serial ATAs that\nreplaced the old IDE drives.\n\n439\n00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.410\nAnd these guys are SATA I,\nSATA II, and SATA III and\n\n440\n00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:55.520\nover the years they've improved and\nincreased their speed from 150 megabytes\n\n441\n00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.290\nper second of throughput to 300\nmegabytes to 600 megabytes.\n\n442\n00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:03.110\nAnd I'm saying throughput and\nnot speed, or at least I'm trying to.\n\n443\n00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:06.110\nSpeed, we're normally talking\nabout how fast the drive can spin,\n\n444\n00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:09.015\nthat doesn't necessarily impact how\nfast we can get data out of it.\n\n445\n00:23:09.015 --> 00:23:13.400\nThroughput, how much data can I actually\nmove through the bus to the disk\n\n446\n00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.820\nin the first place, not even counting\nwriting it actually onto the platter or\n\n447\n00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.710\nwhatever So up to 600 megabytes.\n\n448\n00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:21.220\nI did a lower case b, that's wrong.\n\n449\n00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:24.890\nThat should be megabytes, all right, then\nwe get into thinks like fiber Channel.\n\n450\n00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:29.070\nIf you have a SAN, you might have\na fiber HBA, a host bus adapter,\n\n451\n00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.890\nthat connects to the SAN so\nyou gain access to those drives.\n\n452\n00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:36.400\nAnd there's a lot of places that have\nthe 4 gigabyte Fiber Channel deployed.\n\n453\n00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.865\nBecause that was very very\ncommon throughout, say,\n\n454\n00:23:40.865 --> 00:23:44.470\n2000-2010 so\na lot of people have it deployed.\n\n455\n00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.690\nBut it's been replaced by 8 gig and\n\n456\n00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:49.080\n16 gig Fiber Channel which\nis what you would deploy.\n\n457\n00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.460\nIf you did a brand new SAN,\nyou could use 16 gig.\n\n458\n00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:56.366\nAnd if you look at their throughput,\n394 megabytes per second, up to 788.\n\n459\n00:23:56.366 --> 00:23:58.809\nNow we're at 1.5 gigabytes per second,\n\n460\n00:23:58.809 --> 00:24:03.366\nthere's a huge amount of data on the new\nSAN technologies So, those fiber channel\n\n461\n00:24:03.366 --> 00:24:07.150\ndrives have a higher performance\nprovided that fiber channel bus.\n\n462\n00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.950\nAnd then SAS.\n\n463\n00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.910\nSAS drives are probably the most common\ninternal drives on a server today.\n\n464\n00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.470\nIf you go to HP's website,\nor Dell or Lenovo, and\n\n465\n00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:21.520\nyou start to spec out a server they're\nnormally going to have SAS or SATA.\n\n466\n00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.800\nSATA if you're on a budget.\n\n467\n00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.480\nSAS if you're worried about performance.\n\n468\n00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.315\nOn the SAS side you've got 300 megabytes,\n600 megabytes and\n\n469\n00:24:28.315 --> 00:24:33.680\n1.2 gigabyte performance\nright there on the disk.\n\n470\n00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.650\nAnd as you look at it you might say,\nwell with SATA III I can get 600 megabyte.\n\n471\n00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.050\nWith SAS 2 I can get 600 megabyte.\n\n472\n00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:44.610\nWhy would I go SAS 2, why wouldn't I just\ngo with SATA, I can save a lot of money?\n\n473\n00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:47.150\nWhat's different here is\nwhen these came out, right.\n\n474\n00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:50.330\nIt took a while for\nSATA II to reach 300 megabyte,\n\n475\n00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.630\nversus SAS 1 that was already out,\nand was already at 300 megabytes.\n\n476\n00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.510\nSo if we, I didn't put dates on here, but\n\n477\n00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:59.170\nif we followed the dates SAS\nis serial attached SCSI.\n\n478\n00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:01.990\nIt's taking the older SCSI technology and\nmaking it serial,\n\n479\n00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:07.320\nkind of like Serial ATA did, and getting\nincreased performance because of that.\n\n480\n00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.690\nSo, on servers they adopted that\na lot faster than this ASI did.\n\n481\n00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:15.120\n&gt;&gt; All right now one's in the list Don and\nI know you'd been in data centers, been\n\n482\n00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:19.560\naround servers a lot and I just don't know\nthat I can see this technology being used.\n\n483\n00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:23.470\nI'm sure your electronic fund\ntransfers aren't going over USB but\n\n484\n00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.140\nthey do call it out so do you actually\nsee that, other than maybe just\n\n485\n00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.640\nplugging in something externally just to\nmaybe transfer a file, other than that?\n\n486\n00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah sadly, I've seen it.\n\n487\n00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:36.270\nYou do have USB ports on servers, and it's\nreally intended for keyboard and mouse.\n\n488\n00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:41.040\nYou could plug a drive in, it's not really\nintended for any kind of production use.\n\n489\n00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.090\nMaybe you do backups to a USB drive.\n\n490\n00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:46.400\nA lot of servers have USB ports but\nthey're only USB 2.0, right?\n\n491\n00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.110\nAnd USB 2.0 is not terribly fast.\n\n492\n00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:51.373\nWes, do you remember the speed-\n&gt;&gt; 480 megabits per second.\n\n493\n00:25:51.373 --> 00:25:53.220\n&gt;&gt; Megabits, right, see,\ninfinite knowledge of numbers.\n\n494\n00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.900\nBut 480 sounds impressive,\nand then you hear megabits.\n\n495\n00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.840\nAnd so, you got to divide\nit by 8 to get megabytes.\n\n496\n00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.860\nAnd it's all the sudden\nnot all that impressive.\n\n497\n00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.930\nIt's what, 16 megabytes or something?\n\n498\n00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:05.110\nBut then, you get to USB 3, and\nUSB 3 is actually pretty respectable.\n\n499\n00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:06.990\nIt can move a good bit of data.\n\n500\n00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.530\nBut you don't normally\nhave USB 3 in a server.\n\n501\n00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:12.210\nAnd even if you did, USB 3 is nice when\nyou're doing single reads and writes but\n\n502\n00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:13.810\nwhen you try and\nsend more than one operation to it,\n\n503\n00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:15.100\nit really starts to crawl.\n\n504\n00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.120\nIt's not designed for production workload.\n\n505\n00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.060\nSo while USB is a bus that's\navailable inside of a server, and\n\n506\n00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:25.670\nyou could attach storage on that USB bus,\nthe only example where I might use it\n\n507\n00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:27.760\nis when I'm installing\nan operating system, right?\n\n508\n00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.400\nYou pop on a USB key, or\nmaybe we're trying to do a discless system\n\n509\n00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.420\nwhere it boots up and it gets it's OS\nfrom the network, we're doing PXE boot.\n\n510\n00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:39.830\nSo I might have a USB key inside of\nthe server that contains just that base OS\n\n511\n00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.590\nto get my system to boot and\ngrab everything off the network.\n\n512\n00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:47.240\nI've seen a lot of ESXI like VMWare hosts\nthat do that where they'll have a USB\n\n513\n00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.590\nkey inside of them or even an SD\ncard inside of them that has ESXI.\n\n514\n00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:56.570\nESXI is like 600 megabytes in size,\nnot very big, and so it can boot up, load\n\n515\n00:26:56.570 --> 00:27:01.040\nthat all into RAM and run it from RAM so\nit doesn't matter that storage was slow.\n\n516\n00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.500\nIt just slows down the boot up.\n\n517\n00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.600\nAnd then once we are running, everything\nelse is pull off the sand, and so\n\n518\n00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.410\nyou can move fast there.\n\n519\n00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:08.730\nSo otherwise you don't really\nsee that in production so much.\n\n520\n00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:14.360\nAll right, I did kind of rearrange\nthis a little bit into a second table,\n\n521\n00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.740\nwhich is organized by speed, right?\n\n522\n00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.280\nOr throughput, sorry.\n\n523\n00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.230\nI said I wasn't gonna say speed and\nthen I went and did it.\n\n524\n00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:22.710\nSo, organized by throughput\nfrom lowest to highest.\n\n525\n00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.600\nAnd so you'll see like SATA I\ngot me the lowest throughput\n\n526\n00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.680\nas you moved all the way\nup to Fiber Channel 16.\n\n527\n00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.700\nBut often times there are comparable ones.\n\n528\n00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:36.730\nSo I mentioned how SAS 2 and\nSATA III were right next to each other.\n\n529\n00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:38.518\nThey're both 600 MB.\n\n530\n00:27:38.518 --> 00:27:41.580\nThat should be a capital B,\nMegabytes per second.\n\n531\n00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.400\nSo if I use one versus the other,\ndoes it matter?\n\n532\n00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.000\nWell, the SAS drives\nare usually more durable.\n\n533\n00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.120\nThey usually have a higher RPM.\n\n534\n00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.790\nSo when we get to seek time and\n\n535\n00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:55.860\nlatency, they're normally better even\nthough the throughput is the same.\n\n536\n00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.970\nSo always be aware of the other\ncharacteristics of the drive.\n\n537\n00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.630\nDon't just fixate on bus speed.\n\n538\n00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:03.540\nYou need to understand\nall the characteristics.\n\n539\n00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.200\nSo that always kinda factors in.\n\n540\n00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.060\nAll right.\n\n541\n00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:10.720\nI think as far as covering\nthe primary storage devices we've\n\n542\n00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.780\npretty much covered them.\n\n543\n00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:15.780\nThere are some fringe hardware storage\ndevices that are out there that aren't\n\n544\n00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.660\non the exam.\n\n545\n00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.790\nBut we are gonna spend more time talking\nabout storage over the next few episodes\n\n546\n00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:24.620\nas we configure raid and a few other\nthings that all get involved with storage.\n\n547\n00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:28.960\nBut as far as the types of disks you're\ngonna see, those are pretty much it\n\n548\n00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.250\nuntil the next thing comes along,\nnew technology is always developing.\n\n549\n00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:35.750\n&gt;&gt; A lot of great information, of course I\ngotta throw a little trivial pursuit here.\n\n550\n00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:41.245\nCuz it isn't a history lesson, but that\ngentleman that made your Seagate drive,\n\n551\n00:28:41.245 --> 00:28:44.395\nAlan Shugart, he was not only\nthe inventor of the floppy disk,\n\n552\n00:28:44.395 --> 00:28:46.090\nhe was also the inventor of the SCSI.\n\n553\n00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:47.195\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Believe it or not.\n\n554\n00:28:47.195 --> 00:28:50.475\nSo yeah, it's interesting when you\nlook at some of the history behind it.\n\n555\n00:28:50.475 --> 00:28:51.555\n&gt;&gt; Small storage world.\n\n556\n00:28:51.555 --> 00:28:52.365\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say.\n\n557\n00:28:52.365 --> 00:28:55.010\nBut what is history is\nthe time on the clock there,\n\n558\n00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.480\nso we are going to wrap this one up, Don.\n\n559\n00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.010\nBut any additional words that you\nmight wanna throw out there when\n\n560\n00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:03.270\nconsiderations with your storage\ndevices and server technologies today?\n\n561\n00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:06.750\n&gt;&gt; Don't just assume that the storage on\nthe vendor's website is the best storage\n\n562\n00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:07.500\nto go with, right?\n\n563\n00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:08.820\nAlways read the documentation.\n\n564\n00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.770\nPull the specs.\n\n565\n00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.150\nMake sure you pay attention to throughput,\n\n566\n00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:16.970\nthe general bus speed, the RPMs if\nit's a spinning disk, the latency,\n\n567\n00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:20.340\nthe seek time, the random seeks and\nthe sequential seek.\n\n568\n00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:24.460\nYou gotta pay attention to all that stuff\ncuz it all impacts the performance of that\n\n569\n00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.050\ndisk and you gotta know your software and\nhow it plays with it too.\n\n570\n00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:30.230\nSo do your homework, and if you do your\nhomework and get the right drives,\n\n571\n00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.470\nyou could really get the best\nperformance out of your system.\n\n572\n00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:35.300\nOtherwise you maybe running\nslower than you should be and\n\n573\n00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.920\nmaybe not even know it, and it turns\nout the storage is your bottleneck.\n\n574\n00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.190\n&gt;&gt; Words of wisdom from Don Pezet, if\nyou're not reading it, you're writing it,\n\n575\n00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.020\ndocumentation, documentation.\n\n576\n00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.980\nWell, it does look like we're gonna end\nthis episode, signing out for ITProTV,\n\n577\n00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.620\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n578\n00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:50.410\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n579\n00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.473\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n580\n00:29:52.473 -->

00:00:07.421\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.421 --> 00:00:08.494\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.494 --> 00:00:12.136\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:15.017\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.017 --> 00:00:16.303\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:16.303 --> 00:00:20.386\nAnd in today's episode we are continuing\nthrough our series in CompTIA Server+.\n\n9\n00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:23.910\nAnd joining us in the studios today\nis none other than Mr. Donald Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.950\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.470\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, was ready to\ncontinue on with our Server+ series.\n\n12\n00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.800\nAnd we're in the storage\nsection right now.\n\n13\n00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.510\nWe're gonna keep running with that because\nwe have a lot more to talk about when it\n\n14\n00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.100\ncomes to storage on a server.\n\n15\n00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.950\nIn this episode,\nwe're gonna be focusing on RAID.\n\n16\n00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.210\nRAID, the redundant array of\nindependent disks, or originally,\n\n17\n00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.610\nit was redundant array\nof inexpensive disks.\n\n18\n00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.830\nWhere we combine multiple physical disk\ndrives together to create virtual drives.\n\n19\n00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.990\nWe've already seen it several\ntimes throughout this series.\n\n20\n00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.170\nAnd in fact, if you watched our\nInstalling a Server series of episodes.\n\n21\n00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.890\nI think it was a four part series.\n\n22\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.050\nI showed you guys how to go into a RAID\ncontroller and apply a configuration and\n\n23\n00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.840\nget that up and going.\n\n24\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.640\nSo configuring RAID is\nactually pretty simple.\n\n25\n00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.170\nThe challenging part is figuring out\nwhich type of RAID really works us,\n\n26\n00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.740\nit meets the needs for our environment.\n\n27\n00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.000\nAnd that's what we're gonna\ntalk about in this episode,\n\n28\n00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.100\nis how each RAID level works, and\nhow we pick which one we need,\n\n29\n00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.610\nwhich one gives us\nthe benefits that we want.\n\n30\n00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.260\nSo let me just do a quick recap for\n\n31\n00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.100\nthose of you that didn't watch\nthe installing series, and\n\n32\n00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.330\nwe'll cover kinda how RAID is configured\nand you'll see it's pretty simple.\n\n33\n00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.670\nSo I've got a server pulled up here with\njust a simple UI based management system.\n\n34\n00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.080\nAnd I'm gonna jump into it and\nI'll go down into its hardware, and\n\n35\n00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.750\ninto its RAID configuration.\n\n36\n00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.420\nAnd on this particular system,\nI've got a handful of disks that are kind\n\n37\n00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.360\nof already configured for RAID,\na RAID 10 stripe or whatever.\n\n38\n00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.620\nSo I'm just gonna kinda get that one out.\n\n39\n00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.540\nIf we go in here and remove that.\n\n40\n00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.200\nWe'll pull it out.\n\n41\n00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.370\nAnd then we can go in and you'll see it's\nkinda cleaning it out and rebuilding it.\n\n42\n00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.570\nBut when you go to create a new Raider\nRAID, it really just asks you to come\n\n43\n00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.650\nthrough and\npick which type of a raid you wanna do.\n\n44\n00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.030\nAnd you choose that, and\nthen you select the drives that are gonna\n\n45\n00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.770\nparticipate in that particular\nRaider RAID and that's it.\n\n46\n00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.890\nIt's that simple.\n\n47\n00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.620\nSo the hard part is in this drop down\nbox figuring out which one I wanna pick.\n\n48\n00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.370\nAnd if you watched\nthe installing server episode,\n\n49\n00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.610\nI was doing that in the RAID controller\nitself, so it was a text-based screen, but\n\n50\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.670\nit was really the same question,\nreally just asking me.\n\n51\n00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.050\nAm I wanting to do RAID0 (Striped),\nRAID1 (Mirrored)?\n\n52\n00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.230\nThe controller I used in that\nepisode didn't support RAID4,\n\n53\n00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.260\nwhich is dedicated parity.\n\n54\n00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.020\nRAID5 is distributed parity,\nRAID6 is dual distributed parity, and\n\n55\n00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.490\nRAID10, which is striped and mirrored.\n\n56\n00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.600\nThere are some other variations that\naren't on here, like RAID50, and\n\n57\n00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.750\neven RAID10 but the other way around,\n0 and 1, you'll see that sometimes.\n\n58\n00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.310\nThere's a few more variations that\nyour controllers may support.\n\n59\n00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.100\nEach one is suitable in\ndifferent environments.\n\n60\n00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.680\nWe have to find the one that's right for\nthe particular environment that\n\n61\n00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.590\nwe're working in, and so\nwe've got a lot of choices there.\n\n62\n00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.650\nBut once you pick one,\nlike let's just say I pick RAID5 and\n\n63\n00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.640\nI go to create a device for it.\n\n64\n00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.110\nAll I'm really having to do is pick\nthe disks that wanna participate in it and\n\n65\n00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.098\na few other basic settings\nlike the spare option.\n\n66\n00:03:16.098 --> 00:03:19.370\nIf I wanna have a hot spare or a cold\nspare, I'll talk about that more later,\n\n67\n00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.060\nand whether I wanna set up any kind\nof special chunking or striping size.\n\n68\n00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.440\nWhen you do the striping, which we'll\nlook at again here in just a moment,\n\n69\n00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.650\nyou can choose to have really large\nstripes or really small stripes,\n\n70\n00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.100\nwhich can optimize performance.\n\n71\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.230\nOr it can degrade performance if\nyou choose inappropriately for\n\n72\n00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.360\nyour type of data.\n\n73\n00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.000\nSo we've gotta try and figure out which\none is gonna be the right one for us.\n\n74\n00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.340\nSo how do we know the answers to\nprovide to a configuration like this?\n\n75\n00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.960\nWell, we need to understand our data and\n\n76\n00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.150\nwe need to understand the RAID level so\nwe can choose appropriately.\n\n77\n00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.520\nSo let's run through those RAID levels and\nget an idea of how each one works.\n\n78\n00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.558\nAnd I'm just gonna start at\nthe beginning with RAID 0.\n\n79\n00:03:58.558 --> 00:04:02.750\nRAID 0 is one of the most\nperformance friendly RAID\n\n80\n00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.260\nstructures that are out there.\n\n81\n00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.190\nIn the name RAID, right,\nRedundant Array of Independent Disks.\n\n82\n00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.940\nThe idea there is that we have redundancy,\nthat's the R in RAID,\n\n83\n00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.160\nthat if one disk fails, we can survive it.\n\n84\n00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.790\nWell, RAID 0 is the only one I'm gonna\ntalk about here that actually doesn't\n\n85\n00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.130\nhave redundancy.\n\n86\n00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.400\nIf I lose even one disk with RAID 0,\nI lose the whole array.\n\n87\n00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.010\nAnd the reason is because\nof how RAID 0 functions.\n\n88\n00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.850\nWith RAID 0, what you do is you take your\ndata and you break it up into chunks,\n\n89\n00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.380\nthe little chunks that we just saw\non that drop-down box a moment ago.\n\n90\n00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.390\nAnd you stripe it across multiple disks.\n\n91\n00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.720\nSo for example, let's just pretend\nwe have a 1 MB chunk or stripe size.\n\n92\n00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.710\nSo our stripe size is 1 MB.\n\n93\n00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.240\nAnd I have a 3 MB file.\n\n94\n00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.360\nWhen I write it, the first megabyte\nwill go on the first disk.\n\n95\n00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.200\nThe second megabyte will\ngo on the second disk.\n\n96\n00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.150\nAnd the third megabyte\nwill go on the third disk.\n\n97\n00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.320\nIt stripes it across them, right?\n\n98\n00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.770\nIf I had a 3 MB stripe and\n\n99\n00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.860\nI was writing a 3 MG file, the entire\nfile would just go on the first disk.\n\n100\n00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.680\nAnd that's where that stripe\nsize really comes into play.\n\n101\n00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.012\nBut when we write it, if it's being\nwritten as something larger than\n\n102\n00:05:23.012 --> 00:05:26.469\nthe stripe size, it's gonna get\nbroken up and spread across the disk.\n\n103\n00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:31.230\nSo if it's 9 MB, well,\nfirst megabyte goes on the first disk.\n\n104\n00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.530\nSecond megabyte on the second disk.\n\n105\n00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.040\nThird megabyte on the third disk.\n\n106\n00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.280\nThe fourth megabyte jumps\nback to the first disk.\n\n107\n00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.130\nAnd I'm showing this with three drives.\n\n108\n00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.820\nTechnically you can stripe\non as few as two drives.\n\n109\n00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.630\nBut you can stripe on 15 drives also.\n\n110\n00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.580\nAnd now I'm spreading them\nacross even more drives.\n\n111\n00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.660\nAnd with RAID 0, the more drives the\nbetter, the better performance you'll get.\n\n112\n00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.590\nAnd the reason is when I'm\nwriting to these disks,\n\n113\n00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.610\nif I'm spread across three drives, I can\nbe writing on three drives simultaneously.\n\n114\n00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.910\nIf these are SSDs or spinning disks, you\nreally get a benefit cuz remember the arms\n\n115\n00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.220\ncan only be in one place at a time inside\nthe mechanical part of that drive.\n\n116\n00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.620\nWell, now I've got three completely\nindependent sets of arms\n\n117\n00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.510\nthat can be moved and\npositioned in different places.\n\n118\n00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.750\nI can be writing three different\nthings at the same time.\n\n119\n00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.543\nSo normally, if I had a 3 MB file and\n\n120\n00:06:22.543 --> 00:06:27.774\nI was writing to a single drive,\nI would sequentially write 3 MB.\n\n121\n00:06:27.774 --> 00:06:29.930\nIt would take a certain amount of time.\n\n122\n00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.130\nWhen I write to three drives though,\nI break it up into 1 MB chunks and\n\n123\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.850\nI can write all three 1 MB\nchunks at the same time.\n\n124\n00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.380\nSo now I can write a 3 MB file in the time\nit would take to write a 1 MG file.\n\n125\n00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.890\nThat's a huge performance gain on writes.\n\n126\n00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.410\n&gt;&gt; Don, I've seen on a couple of the work\nstations I've owned, I've seen things like\n\n127\n00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:54.710\nfor instance stripe size of being, for\ninstance, 64k, I believe and 128k now.\n\n128\n00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.697\nAs far as the RAID 0 configuration goes\nI know that's okay with my home machine.\n\n129\n00:06:58.697 --> 00:07:01.980\nIf I lose the operating system I\njust reinstall it, no problem.\n\n130\n00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.628\nBut in a production environment where\nit might be a commonality that you, or\n\n131\n00:07:05.628 --> 00:07:07.395\nis it a commonality for that matter,\n\n132\n00:07:07.395 --> 00:07:11.341\nfor RAID 0 when we need redundancy in as\nclose to 100% of the time as possible?\n\n133\n00:07:11.341 --> 00:07:14.010\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nlet's take up time out of the equation,\n\n134\n00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:18.570\nbecause RAID 0 does not impact up time,\nor doesn't help up time at all, right?\n\n135\n00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.070\nSo with RAID 0 having 15 disks,\nor having 1 disk,\n\n136\n00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.550\nyou'll have the exact same up time.\n\n137\n00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.860\nSo there's no redundancy or\nup time factors into this at all.\n\n138\n00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.250\nIt's simply performance.\n\n139\n00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.440\nRAID 0 is all about performance.\n\n140\n00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.050\nAnd on the performance size you've\ngotta think about your data.\n\n141\n00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.032\nLet's say that I'm\nstoring pictures on this.\n\n142\n00:07:36.032 --> 00:07:39.560\nMaybe I have a document imaging system,\nso there's lots of images.\n\n143\n00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.370\nIf the images are consistently\nover a megabyte and\n\n144\n00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.390\nmy stripe size is 128 kilobytes.\n\n145\n00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:52.121\nWell, I know that each image is gonna be\nbroken up into at least eight pieces,\n\n146\n00:07:52.121 --> 00:07:52.747\nright?\n\n147\n00:07:52.747 --> 00:07:55.300\nSo into eight little chunks to\nstripe across those drives.\n\n148\n00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.146\nSo if I have up to eight disks in that\narray, I'm gonna benefit from it.\n\n149\n00:07:59.146 --> 00:08:02.802\nBut let's say that those images\nare only 14K in size, right?\n\n150\n00:08:02.802 --> 00:08:06.592\nA lot of document imaging, they use tifs,\nand tiffs are pretty small, so\n\n151\n00:08:06.592 --> 00:08:09.810\nmaybe they're 14K in size,\nand my stripe size is 128K.\n\n152\n00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:15.878\nWell, a 14K tiff would fit in\none chunk in that stripe, right?\n\n153\n00:08:15.878 --> 00:08:17.697\nAnd so now,when I write a tiff file,\n\n154\n00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:20.358\nam I gonna write to more than\none disk at the same time?\n\n155\n00:08:20.358 --> 00:08:24.490\nNo, I'm gonna write that\ntiff to a single drive, so\n\n156\n00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.980\nnow I don't get\na performance gain anymore.\n\n157\n00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.300\nAnd remember that performance\nis on the read and the write, so\n\n158\n00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.380\nwhen I write,\nif it's bigger than the stripe size,\n\n159\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.550\nI can be writing to more than one disk,\nI'm going to write faster.\n\n160\n00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.388\nAnd when I read,\nI can read from more than one disk,\n\n161\n00:08:39.388 --> 00:08:43.790\nI'm gonna read faster, assuming my files\nare broken up across those systems.\n\n162\n00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:47.540\nSo if I know that I'm gonna have\na huge amount of 14K files,\n\n163\n00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.900\nI need to pick a really small stripe size\n\n164\n00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.700\nif I wanna get any kind of\nperformance benefit out of this.\n\n165\n00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.080\nBut if I know I've got big files,\nI can choose a bigger stripe size.\n\n166\n00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.910\nThe bigger the stripe size the easier\nit is for the controller to manage it.\n\n167\n00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.410\nSo the larger it gets the lower of a load\nyou create on the RAID controller.\n\n168\n00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:09.980\nNow RAID controllers can handle a ton\nof work but there's huge variations.\n\n169\n00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.590\nYou can get consumer grade RAID\ncontrollers that are 50 bucks.\n\n170\n00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.180\nAnd then you go into the Enterprise\nworld and they're $5,000.\n\n171\n00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.618\nWhy such a huge difference and\nit all comes down to performance.\n\n172\n00:09:19.618 --> 00:09:24.040\nOn a $5,000 RAID controller you can\nhandle a super small stripe size and\n\n173\n00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.300\nit will manage it just fine and\nit's no big deal it runs like nothing.\n\n174\n00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.660\nBut when you get that consumer one at home\nand it doesn't deal with that so well.\n\n175\n00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.330\nSo when you go to configure\nit there will be limitations.\n\n176\n00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.610\nUsually when you go to pick the stripe\nsize I believe on the episode we did\n\n177\n00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.166\ninstalling the server, my server only\nhad two to three different options for\n\n178\n00:09:41.166 --> 00:09:44.120\nstripe size I didn't have a whole\nlot of variations in there that\n\n179\n00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.019\nI could pick from.\n\n180\n00:09:45.019 --> 00:09:48.284\nYou can go with the defaults which is\nsupposed to be a good middle ground but\n\n181\n00:09:48.284 --> 00:09:52.230\nthe defaults don't know your data,\nthey don't know what you're dealing with.\n\n182\n00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.486\nSo when we get to somewhere like\nthis where we can pick a chunk size,\n\n183\n00:09:56.486 --> 00:10:01.276\nif I have 14K files, and I pick a 4K\nstripe size, that's good, right?\n\n184\n00:10:01.276 --> 00:10:05.360\nA 14K file would be broken up into\nthree or four different chunks.\n\n185\n00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.330\nBut if I choose something 16K or\n\n186\n00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.270\nhigher, all of a sudden I'm not\nbenefiting from performance any more.\n\n187\n00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.960\nI mean, if I'm writing more than one\nfile simultaneously, then I'd benefit.\n\n188\n00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.090\nBut if I'm just dealing with\nindividual reads and writes,\n\n189\n00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:17.620\nthen I'm not gonna benefit anymore.\n\n190\n00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.060\nSo that all comes into play\nwith choosing how we do this.\n\n191\n00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.900\nMost people look at RAID 0 as\nthe definitive solution for performance.\n\n192\n00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.810\nBut if you configure it incorrectly, you\nmight not be even getting a performance\n\n193\n00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.820\ngain out of it and\nthen it's really just a waste of time.\n\n194\n00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.660\nCuz all it's doing is spanning across the\ndisks, which you could do without RAID,\n\n195\n00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.670\nyou don't even need RAID for that.\n\n196\n00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.360\nNow on the failure side, I mentioned\nlike put redundancy out of your mind,\n\n197\n00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.445\nbecause what happens if I lose a disk?\n\n198\n00:10:44.445 --> 00:10:47.430\nWell if I lose a disk,\nI'll lose part of the stripes.\n\n199\n00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.400\nAnd losing part of the stripes is just\nlike losing a part of the hard drive, and\n\n200\n00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.420\nthis is being treated as a one big\nhard drive, I'll lose the whole thing.\n\n201\n00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:57.100\nLet me show you what I mean,\nif we were to take this last disk here,\n\n202\n00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.300\nthe one that's got 3, 6, and 9 on it.\n\n203\n00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.941\nIf that disc were to fail and\nit goes away, right?\n\n204\n00:11:02.941 --> 00:11:03.984\n[SOUND] Gone.\n\n205\n00:11:03.984 --> 00:11:05.301\nWhat am I left with?\n\n206\n00:11:05.301 --> 00:11:11.791\nWell, 1, 2, and then I jump to 4,\n5, I'm missing 3, 6, and 9.\n\n207\n00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:14.944\nIf I've got a 9 meg file that's\nbroken up across these three drives,\n\n208\n00:11:14.944 --> 00:11:17.310\nI'm missing a third of that file.\n\n209\n00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.950\nWhat good is a third of\nthe file gonna do for me?\n\n210\n00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.090\nNothing, right?\n\n211\n00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:25.040\nIt's pointless, so if I lose even\na single drive, this whole array fails.\n\n212\n00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.955\nSo this is not redundant,\nit's purely for performance.\n\n213\n00:11:27.955 --> 00:11:30.630\nNow, I know what you're thinking,\nwell, I'm not gonna do that.\n\n214\n00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.450\nForget that, I need redundancy.\n\n215\n00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.440\nWe don't always need redundancy.\n\n216\n00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.230\nYou might have 30 web servers, right?\n\n217\n00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:42.910\nA web server farm, and every one of\nthem is hosting copies of the webpage.\n\n218\n00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:46.330\nAnd if one web server fails, you just take\nit out of the pool, it's not a big deal,\n\n219\n00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.270\nyou've got 29 more, right?\n\n220\n00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:52.690\nSo I may want RAID on it to increase\nthe read and write performance but\n\n221\n00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:56.350\nnot worry about redundancy, because I\nknow I've got other servers in place.\n\n222\n00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.660\nYou'll see that with\nread-only database servers.\n\n223\n00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.530\nWhen you go to Amazon's webpage and\nyou search for\n\n224\n00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:03.690\na product you're not searching\noff of their main database.\n\n225\n00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.450\nYou're searching off of\nread only copies of it.\n\n226\n00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.440\nAnd so those will be tuned for\nperformance not redundancy,\n\n227\n00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.940\nbecause they'll have a bunch of them.\n\n228\n00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.690\nAnd if one fails you just connect\nto a different one and that's it.\n\n229\n00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.510\nSo they're tuned for performance.\n\n230\n00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:20.466\nRAID 0 is very common in production\nenvironments where you have multiple\n\n231\n00:12:20.466 --> 00:12:23.675\nservers, where you've scaled\nout instead of scaling up.\n\n232\n00:12:23.675 --> 00:12:26.852\nNow, if you only have one database server,\nyeah, you don't wanna use RAID 0,\n\n233\n00:12:26.852 --> 00:12:29.700\nbecause if you have a drive fail,\nthe whole server goes offline.\n\n234\n00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.679\nAnd if you're working with a critical\nsystem, you need it to be up as much as\n\n235\n00:12:33.679 --> 00:12:37.046\npossible and that's where our\nother RAID array types come in.\n\n236\n00:12:37.046 --> 00:12:41.882\nSo RAID 0, the use case scenario for\nit is I have data that I want to improve\n\n237\n00:12:41.882 --> 00:12:46.880\nthe read and write performance on,\nand I'm not worried about redundancy.\n\n238\n00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:52.900\nThe next one is RAID 1,\nRAID 1 is mirroring, and unlike RAID 0,\n\n239\n00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.420\nwhere we can have two\nto however many drives,\n\n240\n00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.920\nmost controllers cap you at about 15,\nso 2 to 15, but some can go higher.\n\n241\n00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:06.990\nIn RAID 1, RAID 1 only works with\ntwo drives, you can only have two.\n\n242\n00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:10.680\nAnd that's because it's a mirror,\nit's simply taking whatever's on the first\n\n243\n00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.460\ndrive and\nwriting a copy of it on the second drive.\n\n244\n00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.750\nNow, on a positive side, I get redundancy.\n\n245\n00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:19.590\nIf one drive fails, right?\n\n246\n00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:24.140\nSo this drive over here fails, I've got\na copy of everything right there on\n\n247\n00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.360\nthe other drive,\nI just flip over and that's it.\n\n248\n00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.320\nThe end user doesn't usually even notice,\n\n249\n00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.450\nit just happens seamlessly, and\noff you go, that's it, right?\n\n250\n00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:38.080\nSo I get great redundancy, but\non the performance side what do I get?\n\n251\n00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.454\nNothing I'm writing to the disk and\nyour RAID controller usually just clones\n\n252\n00:13:42.454 --> 00:13:45.090\nthe write operation and\nyou write to the disk.\n\n253\n00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.811\nIt's the same thing,\nit's written to the two different disks.\n\n254\n00:13:46.811 --> 00:13:48.594\nAnd when you read,\nyou just read from one of them,\n\n255\n00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:51.160\nwhoever is the active member of that\nmirror is who you are reading from.\n\n256\n00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.108\nUnless it fails and then you just\nstart reading from the other one.\n\n257\n00:13:53.108 --> 00:13:54.835\nSo as far as reads and writes,\n\n258\n00:13:54.835 --> 00:13:58.789\nyou get the exact same performance\nas you would off of a single disk.\n\n259\n00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.962\nNow, let's talk about that for\njust a moment.\n\n260\n00:14:01.962 --> 00:14:06.720\nWhen you're doing hardware RAID,\nyou will get the exact same performance.\n\n261\n00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.180\nBut what if you're doing software RAID?\n\n262\n00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.610\nSoftware RAID is what we don't\nhave a hardware RAID controller,\n\n263\n00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.710\ninstead we're doing it\nin our operating system.\n\n264\n00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.901\nLinux, Windows, Mac OS,\nthey all support software RAID,\n\n265\n00:14:17.901 --> 00:14:20.880\nsoftware RAID seems like a good idea,\nbut it really isn't.\n\n266\n00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.330\nAnd tha's because, you don't have\na hardware rate controller, so your CPU,\n\n267\n00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.780\nyour general purpose\nCPU has to do the work.\n\n268\n00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:31.830\nSo now, any time I send a write operation,\nthe CPU has to clone it and\n\n269\n00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.210\nwrite it to the disk, so\nI actually take a performance hit.\n\n270\n00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:38.010\nSo a mirror with software RAID,\nhurts performance.\n\n271\n00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.070\nActually with all of the RAID\ntypes I'm about to talk about,\n\n272\n00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:43.340\nif you do them in software,\nthey hurt performance a little bit, right?\n\n273\n00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.630\nYou're always better off doing\nhardware RAID, on a server,\n\n274\n00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.420\nthat should be a given,\njust do hardware RAID.\n\n275\n00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.698\nOn a workstation or a lab environment,\ntheir software RAID might be suitable, but\n\n276\n00:14:52.698 --> 00:14:54.724\non a server, you want a hardware RAID.\n\n277\n00:14:54.724 --> 00:14:58.263\n&gt;&gt; Don, in this episode that we did where\nyou showed us the server components,\n\n278\n00:14:58.263 --> 00:15:01.711\none of the things that you showed us\nwas a dedicated RAID controller card.\n\n279\n00:15:01.711 --> 00:15:03.211\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It was in a PCIe slot but\n\n280\n00:15:03.211 --> 00:15:07.382\nyou also had one that was controlled\nby like the chipset that was built into\n\n281\n00:15:07.382 --> 00:15:08.070\nthe board.\n\n282\n00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:12.083\nGive us a comparison on what you might see\nif you happen to utilize one that's built\n\n283\n00:15:12.083 --> 00:15:16.231\ninto the functionality of the motherboard\nversus one of the I directs or something.\n\n284\n00:15:16.231 --> 00:15:19.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the ones that are built into\nthe chipset, they're normally from Intel.\n\n285\n00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.756\nThe Intel matrix controllers,\nthose are really, really common.\n\n286\n00:15:21.756 --> 00:15:23.504\nBut you also have the Promise Arrays,\n\n287\n00:15:23.504 --> 00:15:26.409\nPromise is another company that's\nout there and a few others.\n\n288\n00:15:26.409 --> 00:15:30.180\nAnd they're designed for\nlow performance needs, right?\n\n289\n00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.030\nThey're designed for home users,\nI've got a workstation at home and\n\n290\n00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.440\nI wanna mirror the drives for redundancy.\n\n291\n00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.060\nOr I wanna do RAID 0, so\nvideo games play faster.\n\n292\n00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.780\nAnd they're tuned for\nthat kind of thing, for large files.\n\n293\n00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:44.520\nThey're not really tuned for\n24/7, constant reads and writes,\n\n294\n00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.210\nlots of random seeks, all that something,\nthey're not really tuned for that cuz\n\n295\n00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.070\nthey're designed for small workloads,\nthey're designed for workstations.\n\n296\n00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.374\nWell in a server, the integrated\nRAID controller's usually a little\n\n297\n00:15:53.374 --> 00:15:56.345\nbit better but they're typically\nlimited on functionality.\n\n298\n00:15:56.345 --> 00:16:00.470\nYou might only be able to choose\nbetween RAID 1 and RAID 5,\n\n299\n00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.036\nyou might be limited as much as that.\n\n300\n00:16:03.036 --> 00:16:06.292\nBut when you do the dedicated RAID\ncontrollers, you get a ton more.\n\n301\n00:16:06.292 --> 00:16:07.628\nUsually get support for\n\n302\n00:16:07.628 --> 00:16:11.447\nmany different types of RAID as well\nas the ability to do duplexing.\n\n303\n00:16:11.447 --> 00:16:14.609\nWe have more than one RAID controller for\nredundancy purposes there too,\n\n304\n00:16:14.609 --> 00:16:16.535\nin case a controller fails.\n\n305\n00:16:16.535 --> 00:16:20.865\nAnd you get additional features like\na battery backed right cache controller,\n\n306\n00:16:20.865 --> 00:16:23.458\nwhich I'll talk more\nabout a little bit later.\n\n307\n00:16:23.458 --> 00:16:25.091\nI need to get through\nmy RAID arrays first.\n\n308\n00:16:25.091 --> 00:16:28.257\nSo there's plenty of reasons where we'd\nwanna go with a hardware RAID controller.\n\n309\n00:16:28.257 --> 00:16:30.752\nIt's more expensive, but\nit's something that we'll typically want.\n\n310\n00:16:30.752 --> 00:16:33.090\n&gt;&gt; And\nI just wanted to get my terminology right.\n\n311\n00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.266\nI mentioned iDRAC,\nthat's a remote access controller.\n\n312\n00:16:35.266 --> 00:16:38.015\nI meant the PERC control, a PERC\ncontroller's what I meant to say there.\n\n313\n00:16:38.015 --> 00:16:42.945\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, HPE calls theirs the Smart Array\nor HPE Smart Array Controllers.\n\n314\n00:16:42.945 --> 00:16:47.061\nDell calls theirs PERCs, or\nthe Power Edge RAID Controller.\n\n315\n00:16:47.061 --> 00:16:49.120\nDell servers are called PowerEdge servers.\n\n316\n00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.623\nDifferent people have different names for\nthem, right?\n\n317\n00:16:50.623 --> 00:16:52.930\nBut those are their\ndedicated RAID controllers.\n\n318\n00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.174\nDell actually integrates a lot of\nperks right into the motherboard.\n\n319\n00:16:55.174 --> 00:16:57.852\nSo they're a little bit better than\nsome of the ones that are out there.\n\n320\n00:16:57.852 --> 00:16:59.470\nLot of HPE servers just\nhave the Intel ones,\n\n321\n00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.460\ncuz they know that you\ncan get a smart array and\n\n322\n00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.090\nit's kinda might be better so,\nbut they give you that option.\n\n323\n00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:05.950\nAll right, so in RAID 1,\n\n324\n00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:09.900\nthe key thing to remember here is that we\ndon't really get any performance changes.\n\n325\n00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.978\nWhen you're doing hardware RAID,\na RAID 1 mirror will read and\n\n326\n00:17:12.978 --> 00:17:15.830\nwrite at about the same speed\nas a regular individual disk.\n\n327\n00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:17.926\nBecause that's effectively\nwhat you're doing,\n\n328\n00:17:17.926 --> 00:17:19.787\nyou're just cloning the right operations.\n\n329\n00:17:19.787 --> 00:17:22.930\nSo no performance, just redundancy.\n\n330\n00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.409\nRAID 0,\nno redundancy just performance, right?\n\n331\n00:17:25.409 --> 00:17:29.046\nSo we're kind of choosing\nour side in that battle.\n\n332\n00:17:29.046 --> 00:17:32.107\nAnd that's where RAID 5 enters the mix.\n\n333\n00:17:32.107 --> 00:17:38.100\nWith RAID 5,\nwe get both performance and redundancy.\n\n334\n00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.890\nWhat RAID 5 does is it takes RAID 0,\n\n335\n00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:45.400\nstriping, and\nit adds redundancy to the stripe mixture.\n\n336\n00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.480\nAnd the way it does that is by\ncalculating a parity block, and\n\n337\n00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.860\nparity works kind of an interesting way.\n\n338\n00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.970\nAs you write your data across your drives,\n\n339\n00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:59.260\none drive will contain a parity block for\nthat stripe.\n\n340\n00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:03.560\nAnd it's not entirely on one drive,\ninstead it's spread across the drives, and\n\n341\n00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.410\nthere's a reason for that.\n\n342\n00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:07.450\nLet me kind of walk through this process,\nand we'll see the reason.\n\n343\n00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:09.770\nThere is an alternative, which is RAID 4.\n\n344\n00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:14.281\nRAID 4 is where all the parity is on\na single disk and so that can be used.\n\n345\n00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:15.129\nDo I have a diagram for that?\n\n346\n00:18:15.129 --> 00:18:16.377\nNo, I don't have a diagram for it.\n\n347\n00:18:16.377 --> 00:18:18.813\nBut that's where all\nthe parity is on one disk and\n\n348\n00:18:18.813 --> 00:18:23.780\nthere's a particular scenario where it's\nbeneficial, most people don't need that.\n\n349\n00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.110\nBut with RAID 5, when I go and\nwrite a 6 meg file, for example.\n\n350\n00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:31.460\nLet's say, I have a o1 e meg stripe size,\nand I'm writing a 6 meg file.\n\n351\n00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.517\nIt's gonna write the first meg on\ndrive 1 the second meg on drive 2, and\n\n352\n00:18:35.517 --> 00:18:37.725\nthen it's gonna write a parity block.\n\n353\n00:18:37.725 --> 00:18:44.033\nAnd it's gonna move to the next set and\nwrite the third meg on drive 1 again.\n\n354\n00:18:44.033 --> 00:18:48.960\nAnd then the parity block on drive 2, and\nthen the fourth meg on drive 3, and so on.\n\n355\n00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.147\nSee how the parity block is\nmoving from drive to drive.\n\n356\n00:18:52.147 --> 00:18:55.320\nIt is not one drive that\nholds all the parity blocks.\n\n357\n00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.910\nThe idea here is that if I lose a drive.\n\n358\n00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.268\nLet's say that I lose this last drive.\n\n359\n00:19:01.268 --> 00:19:03.978\nWell I lost a parity block,\nwhich I am okay with.\n\n360\n00:19:03.978 --> 00:19:06.080\nI don't need the parity block.\n\n361\n00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.110\nAnd then I lost 4 and 6, the fourth\nmegabyte and the sixth megabyte.\n\n362\n00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.721\nNow I need those, that's part of my data.\n\n363\n00:19:11.721 --> 00:19:14.650\nA third of the data in this file is gone.\n\n364\n00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:18.299\nWell, I don't have those files anymore,\nthat portion of the file.\n\n365\n00:19:18.299 --> 00:19:22.890\nBut I do have parity blocks and\nI can rebuild it.\n\n366\n00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:24.780\nWhat happens is something\nkind interesting.\n\n367\n00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.806\nIt's actually a really\nsimple operation and\n\n368\n00:19:26.806 --> 00:19:28.678\nwhoever thought of it is just brilliant.\n\n369\n00:19:28.678 --> 00:19:31.356\nThis is what the PhDs in\ncomputer science do all days,\n\n370\n00:19:31.356 --> 00:19:33.950\nis they come up with\ncrazy ideas like this.\n\n371\n00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:37.272\nAnd the way that parity works is it says,\nokay,\n\n372\n00:19:37.272 --> 00:19:40.691\nI'm gonna look at the data for\na particular bit.\n\n373\n00:19:40.691 --> 00:19:44.358\nI'm gonna take a look at the data for\na particular bit in drive one.\n\n374\n00:19:44.358 --> 00:19:47.570\nAnd I'm gonna take a look at\nthe data in drive two, that bit.\n\n375\n00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:51.070\nAnd remember,\na bit is either gonna be zero or one.\n\n376\n00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:56.660\nIf I've got a zero here and a zero here,\nI'm gonna treat that as an even number.\n\n377\n00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.084\n0 plus 0 is 0.\n\n378\n00:19:58.084 --> 00:20:01.190\nIf I've got a 0 here and\na 1 nhere, 1 plus 1 ne is 1,\n\n379\n00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:04.030\nI'm gonna treat that as an odd number.\n\n380\n00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:09.250\nIf I've got a 1 here and a 0 here,\nthose add up to 1, that's an odd number.\n\n381\n00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:13.480\nIf I've got a 1 here and a 1 here that\nadds up to 2, that's an even number.\n\n382\n00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:18.068\nAnd I'm gonna put a mark in the parity\nblock that says whether they add up to\n\n383\n00:20:18.068 --> 00:20:20.151\nan odd or an even number, right?\n\n384\n00:20:20.151 --> 00:20:22.840\nAnd so we'll designate that so we know.\n\n385\n00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.210\nAnd when we lose a drive, so\nif I lose this drive right here,\n\n386\n00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.180\nI'm gonna lose block 4.\n\n387\n00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:33.313\nWell, it can look at block 3,\nand it sees a 0.\n\n388\n00:20:33.313 --> 00:20:34.862\nAnd then it looks at the parity, and\n\n389\n00:20:34.862 --> 00:20:38.310\nthe parity tells me that I'm\nsupposed to have an even number.\n\n390\n00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:42.540\nWell if I had a 0 here, and\nI had a 1 on the missing drive,\n\n391\n00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.720\nthat would add up to an odd number so\nthat's not it.\n\n392\n00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.670\nBut if I add a zero here and\na zero on the missing drive,\n\n393\n00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:51.380\nthat's an even number I must have\nhad a zero on that last drive.\n\n394\n00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.705\nAnd so we can figure out what was\non that drive that was missing.\n\n395\n00:20:55.705 --> 00:20:58.969\nNow here's the good part.\n\n396\n00:20:58.969 --> 00:21:02.775\nWe get redundancy, I can lose a drive and\nfigure out what I lost.\n\n397\n00:21:02.775 --> 00:21:05.110\nSo I can actually lose a drive\nin RAID 5 and I'll be fine.\n\n398\n00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:09.370\nHere's the bad part, performance.\n\n399\n00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:14.560\nEvery time I write to a RAID 5 array,\nI've gotta update the parity block.\n\n400\n00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.430\nSo every time we write to the disk,\nwe've got to do a mathematical\n\n401\n00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:20.970\ncalculation to figure out what\nthe parity block should be.\n\n402\n00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.410\nIt's not a big mathematical calculation,\nbut it is one nonetheless.\n\n403\n00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.851\nAnd if you have harder RAID controller\nthat's designed to do that.\n\n404\n00:21:26.851 --> 00:21:28.866\nIn software you'd be doing it in your CPU,\nso\n\n405\n00:21:28.866 --> 00:21:32.190\nit's gonna hurt performance\nevery time you write.\n\n406\n00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:36.690\nNow when I do a read on a healthy array,\nthat doesn't affect me.\n\n407\n00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:41.196\nBut if I do a read on a non healthy array,\nwhat's called a degraded array.\n\n408\n00:21:41.196 --> 00:21:46.890\nNow I do a read, I've gotta look at\nparity and rebuild the missing data.\n\n409\n00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:50.537\nAnd I could do that every single\ntime I read from the array,\n\n410\n00:21:50.537 --> 00:21:52.481\nwhich is usually constantly.\n\n411\n00:21:52.481 --> 00:21:54.685\nSo as soon as you have a drive fail,\n\n412\n00:21:54.685 --> 00:21:58.590\nyour performance goes down significantly,\nall right?\n\n413\n00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:03.952\nSo now my performance is really hurt,\nand we've gotta repair the situation.\n\n414\n00:22:03.952 --> 00:22:07.259\nSo when you repair the situation you\ngo and you get another hard drive,\n\n415\n00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:08.670\nyou pop this one out, right?\n\n416\n00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:11.614\nRemember, we might have hot swap drives,\nwill have little colored handles so\n\n417\n00:22:11.614 --> 00:22:13.365\nyou know you can pop\nthem out while it's live.\n\n418\n00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:16.100\nAnd you pop in a new drive and\nyou can start rebuilding.\n\n419\n00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.625\nIf you don't have hot swap, you gotta shut\nthe server down, change the drive out, and\n\n420\n00:22:19.625 --> 00:22:20.557\nthen power it back up.\n\n421\n00:22:20.557 --> 00:22:22.940\nSo now you had some down\ntime which is annoying.\n\n422\n00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:28.318\nBut once the system comes back up\nwith a nice shiny, brand new drive,\n\n423\n00:22:28.318 --> 00:22:32.795\nthen it can go through\nthe process of rebuilding, okay?\n\n424\n00:22:32.795 --> 00:22:36.180\nNow the new shiny drive\ndoesn't have any data on it.\n\n425\n00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:38.920\nAnd so it's gonna look and it's gonna say,\nokay, well I got one and two here.\n\n426\n00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.616\nSo I need to calculate a parity bit,\nbut I'll wait on that.\n\n427\n00:22:41.616 --> 00:22:44.250\nAnd then I've got three here and\na parity block here.\n\n428\n00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:49.198\nSo I'll rebuild 4, and get it put back in.\n\n429\n00:22:49.198 --> 00:22:53.374\nAnd I've got a parity block in 5,\nso I can rebuild 6.\n\n430\n00:22:53.374 --> 00:22:57.610\nSo it rebuilds 6, rebuilds 4, and\nthen it rebuilds parity for that stripe.\n\n431\n00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:01.905\nAnd now we're back to\nhealthy status again.\n\n432\n00:23:01.905 --> 00:23:09.458\nIt takes time to rebuild that, and\nso during that time, I'm vulnerable.\n\n433\n00:23:09.458 --> 00:23:13.716\nIf I lose one drive, and\nI replace the drive, right?\n\n434\n00:23:13.716 --> 00:23:17.674\nSo I replaced it with a new one and\nit's in the process of rebuilding.\n\n435\n00:23:17.674 --> 00:23:21.770\nIf I lose another drive while\nI'm rebuilding it's too much.\n\n436\n00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.385\nRAID 5 can't survive losing two drives.\n\n437\n00:23:24.385 --> 00:23:26.430\nThere's not enough available to calculate.\n\n438\n00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:31.763\nFor example, if I lost 2 drives,\nI've got block 1, I've got block 3.\n\n439\n00:23:31.763 --> 00:23:33.404\nI'm missing block 2,\n\n440\n00:23:33.404 --> 00:23:37.844\nand I don't have a parity block\nto figure out what was in part 2.\n\n441\n00:23:37.844 --> 00:23:40.230\nI've just lost too much.\n\n442\n00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:43.880\nDown here, I've got a parity block,\nand I don't have 5 and 6.\n\n443\n00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:48.400\nI don't have two bits to compare the odds\nand evens on, I can't rebuild it.\n\n444\n00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.993\nYou've gotta have the rest of the data\nthere, at least a good portion of it,\n\n445\n00:23:51.993 --> 00:23:55.489\nto figure out whether it was odd or\neven to be able to use that parity block.\n\n446\n00:23:55.489 --> 00:23:58.962\nSo RAID 5 can only survive\none drive failure, and\n\n447\n00:23:58.962 --> 00:24:02.199\nwhile you're degraded you're vulnerable.\n\n448\n00:24:02.199 --> 00:24:05.080\nSo, how do we solve that?\n\n449\n00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.850\nWell there was an early solution,\nwhich was RAID 4.\n\n450\n00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:08.055\nRAID 4 said, hey, you know what?\n\n451\n00:24:08.055 --> 00:24:11.610\nLet's just put all of\nour parity on one disk.\n\n452\n00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:15.070\nAnd then roll the dice and hope that\nthat's the disk that fails, right?\n\n453\n00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:17.540\nCuz if the parity disk fails,\nit's no big deal.\n\n454\n00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.190\nBut if you have a 15 drive array and\nall your parity's on one disk,\n\n455\n00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.410\nwhat are the odds of that\nbeing the disk that fails?\n\n456\n00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.015\nPretty low.\nNow, that disk will see more reads and\n\n457\n00:24:26.015 --> 00:24:27.704\nwrites than any other disk.\n\n458\n00:24:27.704 --> 00:24:31.837\nSo it'll see more load, and theoretically\nthat would make it the first to fail.\n\n459\n00:24:31.837 --> 00:24:34.230\nBut it doesn't usually work out that way.\n\n460\n00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:37.910\nSo the better solution is RAID 6.\n\n461\n00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:41.460\nWhat RAID 6 does is it does double parity.\n\n462\n00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.300\nIt says, let's just add\nanother parity block, right?\n\n463\n00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.335\nAnd by doing this,\nsee how I've got where I wrote block 1,\n\n464\n00:24:48.335 --> 00:24:51.581\nI wrote block 2 and\nthen parity 1, parity 2.\n\n465\n00:24:51.581 --> 00:24:55.450\nThen we write block 3, parity 1,\nparity 2, block 4, parity 1,\n\n466\n00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:57.756\nparity 2, block 5, block 6 and so on.\n\n467\n00:24:57.756 --> 00:25:02.003\nWe're staggering two parity stripes,\nright?\n\n468\n00:25:02.003 --> 00:25:05.934\nNow when I do that, if I lose a drive,\nif I lose this last drive,\n\n469\n00:25:05.934 --> 00:25:08.400\n[COUGH] I'm gonna lose blocks 4 and 6.\n\n470\n00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:12.630\nWell I can calculate block\n4 by looking at block 3 and\n\n471\n00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:16.580\nparity 1, and\nfiguring out what was in block 4.\n\n472\n00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.591\nAnd then for block 6,\nI can use parity 1 and\n\n473\n00:25:20.591 --> 00:25:24.503\nblock 5 to figure out what was in block 6.\n\n474\n00:25:24.503 --> 00:25:25.889\nNow what if I lose the second drive?\n\n475\n00:25:25.889 --> 00:25:30.620\nWell if I lose a second drive,\nI've got double parity.\n\n476\n00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.302\nAnd so I'm able to rebuild it,\n\n477\n00:25:32.302 --> 00:25:36.005\nbecause I've got the two different\nparity blocks they can tell me.\n\n478\n00:25:36.005 --> 00:25:38.982\n3 and parity 1 can tell me 4.\n\n479\n00:25:38.982 --> 00:25:41.870\nNow I kinda drew this a little wrong, cuz\nI do have the two parity blocks right next\n\n480\n00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.457\neach other and I shouldn't have done that.\n\n481\n00:25:43.457 --> 00:25:44.782\nIt should be staggered a little more.\n\n482\n00:25:44.782 --> 00:25:47.395\nSo that we've got,\nsee how we have 9 and 10 here?\n\n483\n00:25:47.395 --> 00:25:49.988\nThere should really be\na parity block in this mix,\n\n484\n00:25:49.988 --> 00:25:52.909\nversus having two side by\nside to do the recalc, right?\n\n485\n00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:55.875\nSo 3 and parity 1, I could recalc.\n\n486\n00:25:55.875 --> 00:25:58.199\nParity 2 and 7, I could recalc.\n\n487\n00:25:58.199 --> 00:26:01.704\nHere, I shoulda swapped these around\nin my diagram to illustrate it, but\n\n488\n00:26:01.704 --> 00:26:03.124\nI made my diagram too pretty.\n\n489\n00:26:03.124 --> 00:26:07.630\nBut it can rebuild it, and calculate\nthe data even though I had two disks fail.\n\n490\n00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.350\nAnd the idea is that I shouldn't\nbe surviving two failures.\n\n491\n00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:15.111\nThat I should be surviving one failure\nwhile another was rebuilding, right?\n\n492\n00:26:15.111 --> 00:26:18.965\nIt's really all about rebuilding, we're\ntrying to survive that rebuild process and\n\n493\n00:26:18.965 --> 00:26:20.189\nget back to healthy again.\n\n494\n00:26:20.189 --> 00:26:25.019\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, with the calculation of the\ndouble distributed parity, does that also,\n\n495\n00:26:25.019 --> 00:26:28.405\nlike the RAID 5,\nwould that bring the performance down?\n\n496\n00:26:28.405 --> 00:26:32.527\nLet's say in a perfect healthy array,\ndo we still see even more performance or\n\n497\n00:26:32.527 --> 00:26:34.629\ncalculation, I guess I should say?\n\n498\n00:26:34.629 --> 00:26:37.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; How you're calculating parity twice.\n\n499\n00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.543\n&gt;&gt; Well, as far as calculating parity.\n\n500\n00:26:38.543 --> 00:26:39.477\n&gt;&gt; Or writing, I should say.\n\n501\n00:26:39.477 --> 00:26:41.284\n&gt;&gt; You are calculating parity once.\n\n502\n00:26:41.284 --> 00:26:42.895\nAnd you're just writing it\nto two different places.\n\n503\n00:26:42.895 --> 00:26:46.665\nSo that the math side really isn't that\nmuch worse, but you are writing twice.\n\n504\n00:26:46.665 --> 00:26:48.325\nMost rate controllers can handle that,\nno big deal.\n\n505\n00:26:48.325 --> 00:26:50.430\nSo from that side,\nyou don't have any problems.\n\n506\n00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:51.530\nBut when you have a failure,\n\n507\n00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:53.820\nyou still have that same hit\nof having to calculate parity.\n\n508\n00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.570\nEven though you've got double parity\nblocks, you still have that hit.\n\n509\n00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:59.595\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwith all the calculation of parity now.\n\n510\n00:26:59.595 --> 00:27:04.405\nIt's obviously taken some kind of\nperformance degradation if the RAID fails\n\n511\n00:27:04.405 --> 00:27:06.590\nor a portion of the RAID fails.\n\n512\n00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:07.510\nHow can we get around that?\n\n513\n00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:08.288\nHow can we say, you know what?\n\n514\n00:27:08.288 --> 00:27:10.941\nI don't wanna calculate\nparity at all anymore.\n\n515\n00:27:10.941 --> 00:27:14.400\n&gt;&gt; Well there's a few other solutions\nthat get a little more advanced.\n\n516\n00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.012\nI know we're low on time, so I think\nwe're going to have to save those for\n\n517\n00:27:18.012 --> 00:27:18.970\npart two, tosee.\n\n518\n00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:23.160\nYou can always throw money at a problem,\nthis is the thing I tell CIOs.\n\n519\n00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.750\nYou've got a problem, I can fix it\nif we just throw money at it, right?\n\n520\n00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.581\nThat's the solution to any problem.\n\n521\n00:27:27.581 --> 00:27:28.803\nOkay, you don't want to throw money at it?\n\n522\n00:27:28.803 --> 00:27:30.224\nWell we'll figure something else out,\nright?\n\n523\n00:27:30.224 --> 00:27:35.033\nThere's other ways, but there's ways where\nwe can introduce even more discs and\n\n524\n00:27:35.033 --> 00:27:36.715\neven more stuff to solve it.\n\n525\n00:27:36.715 --> 00:27:39.590\nAnd so there's some advanced raid\nlevels that I want to talk about.\n\n526\n00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.250\nBut since I only have\na little bit of time,\n\n527\n00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:43.360\nlet me focus back on performance for\na second.\n\n528\n00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.020\nIn RAID 5, I said a lot of\nbad things about it, right?\n\n529\n00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.540\nLike I got to calculate parity,\nand that takes effort.\n\n530\n00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.460\nAnd if a drive fails, I survive it,\nbut things get really slow and\n\n531\n00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.670\nit sounds kind of gloom and doom.\n\n532\n00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:56.080\nWhy would I do RAID 5?\n\n533\n00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.950\nRaid 6 is kind of a kludge,\nsort of fixes a little bit,\n\n534\n00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:01.380\nbut I still have performance issues.\n\n535\n00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:09.510\nI have performance issues when the drive\nis degraded, when my array is not healthy.\n\n536\n00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:13.179\nBut when the array is healthy,\nthings actually run pretty well.\n\n537\n00:28:13.179 --> 00:28:16.730\nRemember that RAID 5 is\na mixture of RAID 0 and 1.\n\n538\n00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:20.890\nI'm getting redundancy and\nI'm getting performance.\n\n539\n00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:25.220\nWhen I write to this, even though I'm\nwasting a little bit on the parity block,\n\n540\n00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.870\nI am still writing to multiple\ndisks at the same time.\n\n541\n00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:30.740\nSo let's assume a 1 meg stripe size,\n\n542\n00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.370\nI can be writing 2 megs\nof data at the same time.\n\n543\n00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:37.629\nSo in theory, I'm writing twice as fast,\nnot three times as fast,\n\n544\n00:28:37.629 --> 00:28:38.837\nas I was in RAID 0.\n\n545\n00:28:38.837 --> 00:28:43.135\nBut twice as fast here, cuz I can\nwrite to the 2 and parity, right?\n\n546\n00:28:43.135 --> 00:28:44.891\nReads are also gonna be optimized,\n\n547\n00:28:44.891 --> 00:28:48.380\nwhen I read I don't need to read\nparity if the array is healthy.\n\n548\n00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.110\nAnd so when I read, I'm able to read\nfrom two of these disks at a time.\n\n549\n00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:54.443\nAnd I'm using 2 and\n3 because of my diagrams.\n\n550\n00:28:54.443 --> 00:28:56.790\nIn real life,\nit comes down to how many disks you have?\n\n551\n00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:00.160\nIf I have 15 disks,\nonly 1 of them has a parity block.\n\n552\n00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.551\nI could be reading from the other 14.\n\n553\n00:29:01.551 --> 00:29:05.913\nI could be reading 14 times\nas fast on a 15 drive array.\n\n554\n00:29:05.913 --> 00:29:08.817\nIf it would have arrayed 0,\nI could be reading from all 15 drives.\n\n555\n00:29:08.817 --> 00:29:10.790\nI'm reading 15 times as fast.\n\n556\n00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:15.120\nSo that's the performance gain,\nyou do get a performance gain with RAID 5.\n\n557\n00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:21.712\nIt's not as great as RAID 0, it's one\ndrive less than what RAID 0 would do.\n\n558\n00:29:21.712 --> 00:29:25.515\nBut that trade off for that one drive\nless is that I get redundancy and\n\n559\n00:29:25.515 --> 00:29:27.720\nthat makes RAID 5 very popular.\n\n560\n00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.290\nSo while I said bad things about it,\n\n561\n00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:31.800\nit is the most common form\nof RAID that's out there.\n\n562\n00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.010\nIt's easy to implement,\nit does require a minimum of 3 drives.\n\n563\n00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:41.330\nA mirror with just two drives,\na RAID 0 array good work with two more.\n\n564\n00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:45.430\nAnd there at 5 could work with 3 or more\nwe need 3 because of that parity block\n\n565\n00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:48.158\nit's got to have a minimum\nof three drives to do it.\n\n566\n00:29:48.158 --> 00:29:50.694\nThe maximum is gonna be\nup to a RAID controller.\n\n567\n00:29:50.694 --> 00:29:53.184\nI've seen RAID controllers that go very,\nvery high.\n\n568\n00:29:53.184 --> 00:29:56.124\nI've seen RAID controllers that limit\nyou to just a handful of drives though.\n\n569\n00:29:56.124 --> 00:29:59.181\n15 is pretty common because that's\nusually what you'd see on a SCSI bus, and\n\n570\n00:29:59.181 --> 00:30:01.384\nthat's kinda what they designed\nall this stuff around.\n\n571\n00:30:01.384 --> 00:30:03.047\nEven though we're doing\nserial attached SCSI.\n\n572\n00:30:03.047 --> 00:30:04.968\nAnd so\nSCSI bus limits don't apply to us anymore,\n\n573\n00:30:04.968 --> 00:30:07.320\nyou still see RAID controllers\nfollow some of those limits.\n\n574\n00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.987\nBut usually we don't have RAID\narrays that are that large.\n\n575\n00:30:10.987 --> 00:30:12.818\nWhen you get over the 15 drive limit,\n\n576\n00:30:12.818 --> 00:30:15.370\nthat's when you start hitting sands,\nright?\n\n577\n00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:18.230\nWhen you have a storage area network and\nthe RAID arrays are there.\n\n578\n00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:21.068\nAnd you might have, well heck there's one,\nyou guys can't see it on the camera,\n\n579\n00:30:21.068 --> 00:30:22.026\nit's behind me down here.\n\n580\n00:30:22.026 --> 00:30:26.518\nWhere I know we've got a RAID\narray that is 24 disks.\n\n581\n00:30:26.518 --> 00:30:30.731\nSo you can definitely have some\nthat span pretty large arrays.\n\n582\n00:30:30.731 --> 00:30:32.675\nAll right, well there are some\nadvance ones I want to talk about.\n\n583\n00:30:32.675 --> 00:30:34.890\nBut let's save those for part two,\nand we'll get into that.\n\n584\n00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:37.576\nBut as far as RAID 0, RAID 1, and\n\n585\n00:30:37.576 --> 00:30:40.710\nRAID 5, those are three basic\ncommons that are out there.\n\n586\n00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:43.680\nAnd I threw RAID 6 into the mix,\nthat we need to be familiar with,\n\n587\n00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.411\nyou'll see those on a regular basis.\n\n588\n00:30:45.411 --> 00:30:48.275\nThe ones we'll do in the next episode\nare a little less common, but\n\n589\n00:30:48.275 --> 00:30:51.258\nmore advanced for highly tuned and\nhigh performance environments.\n\n590\n00:30:51.258 --> 00:30:53.712\n&gt;&gt; All right, fun episode,\nlove the hardware stuff.\n\n591\n00:30:53.712 --> 00:30:56.770\nIt does look like as you've said, we're\ncoming to the end of another episode.\n\n592\n00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:00.699\nBut in part one here, Don, before sign\noff, do have any additional words you\n\n593\n00:31:00.699 --> 00:31:03.250\nmight want to throw or\na cliff hanger for part two?\n\n594\n00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.660\n&gt;&gt; Remember,\nyou've got to understand your data.\n\n595\n00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.511\nPicking the right stripe size,\npicking the right rate array.\n\n596\n00:31:08.511 --> 00:31:10.113\nIt's gonna depend on your data.\n\n597\n00:31:10.113 --> 00:31:14.351\nSome things like on a database server,\ntransaction logs are very write heavy,\n\n598\n00:31:14.351 --> 00:31:16.728\nthey need high write performance.\n\n599\n00:31:16.728 --> 00:31:21.740\nSo RAID 0 would be nice, but\nwe can't survive a failure, right?\n\n600\n00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:24.860\nSo RAID 1 mirrors will get\nyou the best performance.\n\n601\n00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.397\nBut the database itself needs better\nread performance with some redundancy.\n\n602\n00:31:28.397 --> 00:31:30.840\nAnd so RAID 5 works out better for\nthe database.\n\n603\n00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.158\nYou might have to mix and\nmatch which you can certainly do.\n\n604\n00:31:33.158 --> 00:31:35.554\nYou can create separate containers and\nmix and\n\n605\n00:31:35.554 --> 00:31:39.618\nmatch the RAID types to get the best\nperformance for what your system is doing.\n\n606\n00:31:39.618 --> 00:31:41.070\nAlways be aware of that.\n\n607\n00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.260\nIt's not a one size fits all.\n\n608\n00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:44.701\n&gt;&gt; Well the knowledge Don, as always,\n\n609\n00:31:44.701 --> 00:31:46.567\nwe

ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.837\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.837 --> 00:00:16.400\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.790\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\nthrough our CompTIA Server+ certification.\n\n8\n00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.963\nWe're actually coming back with\na part two on RAID configurations.\n\n9\n00:00:23.963 --> 00:00:29.490\nAnd joining us and lending his expertise\nin this is none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.330\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.010\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes,\nready to dive right back into RAID.\n\n12\n00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.801\nWe left off talking about some of the\nstandard types, RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5.\n\n13\n00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:43.526\nAnd when we kinda left off, Wes was saying\nhow, with RAID 5, we get redundancy,\n\n14\n00:00:43.526 --> 00:00:45.030\nwhich is nice.\n\n15\n00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.000\nBut we take a bit of a performance hit.\n\n16\n00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.690\nAnd so there's gotta be a better\nsolution that's out there.\n\n17\n00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.640\nAnd I made the comment that, hey,\nanything can be made better with money.\n\n18\n00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.090\nSo let's double back to that statement and\nexplain how money solves this problem.\n\n19\n00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.026\nWhen you deploy RAID, you're,\nin a way, wasting money,\n\n20\n00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:07.769\nthat you're taking drives and\ngiving them up in order for redundancy.\n\n21\n00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:10.480\nSo you lose a certain amount of storage,\nright?\n\n22\n00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.830\nLet me go back to my diagrams from the\nfirst show, and I'll explain what I mean.\n\n23\n00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.620\nWith RAID 0,\nI got great performance, right?\n\n24\n00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.170\nBecause I can write to multiple\ndrives at the same time,\n\n25\n00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.970\nI can read from drives at the same time.\n\n26\n00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.110\nI'm not doing any parity calculations,\nso performance is very high.\n\n27\n00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.910\nLet's assume, for a moment,\nthat these are all 1-terabyte drives.\n\n28\n00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.340\nI have three 1-terabyte drives.\n\n29\n00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.310\nIn RAID 0, I get to use all of them.\n\n30\n00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.630\nSo I have a 3-terabyte\ncontainer that I'm creating,\n\n31\n00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.980\none big container\nstretched across this disk.\n\n32\n00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.240\nI get 3 terabytes.\n\n33\n00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.070\nSo if I buy 3 terabytes of storage,\nI get to use 3 terabytes of storage.\n\n34\n00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.451\nThat's a good exchange, right?\n\n35\n00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:49.909\nOne-to-one ratio, perfect.\n\n36\n00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.410\nVersus, if we take a look at mirroring.\n\n37\n00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.900\nWith mirroring, let's assume, for\na moment, these are 1-terabyte drives.\n\n38\n00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.890\nWell, I take 1 terabyte a day to here and\nclone it onto the other disk.\n\n39\n00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.920\nAnd what that means is,\n\n40\n00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.500\nwhile I have 1-terabyte drives,\nI don't get 2 terabytes of storage.\n\n41\n00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.030\nI get 1 terabyte of storage.\n\n42\n00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.200\nThe other terabyte's being used for\nthe mirror.\n\n43\n00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.180\nSo I'm giving up 50% of my storage.\n\n44\n00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.610\nOr another way to look at it is,\n\n45\n00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.800\nmy storage just got twice as expensive,\nright?\n\n46\n00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.710\nBecause, instead of buying\na single terabyte drive,\n\n47\n00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.990\nnow I've gotta buy two of them.\n\n48\n00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.360\nAnd I still only get 1\nterabyte of storage.\n\n49\n00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.260\nSo that's where cost comes in.\n\n50\n00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.540\nHey, I want this drive to be redundant.\n\n51\n00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.540\nWell, let me just throw money at it.\n\n52\n00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.390\nIf I pay twice as much,\nI can get two discs.\n\n53\n00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.809\nAnd now I can get a mirror, and\nnow I've solved my problem.\n\n54\n00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:42.700\nRAID 5 tries to keep that to a minimum.\n\n55\n00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.930\nWith RAID 5,\nI don't wanna lose 50% of my storage.\n\n56\n00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.560\nInstead, we're giving up just one drive.\n\n57\n00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.500\nHere, I've got a three-drive array.\n\n58\n00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.740\nAnd I have parity blocks,\n\n59\n00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.700\nstriped across them, that equal out\nto the total size of one drive.\n\n60\n00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.159\nSo in a three-drive array,\nI'm losing 33% of my storage.\n\n61\n00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.727\nI'm losing a third, or\none of the three drives.\n\n62\n00:03:06.727 --> 00:03:07.610\nThat's not so bad.\n\n63\n00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.289\nThat's better than a mirror,\nwhere it was 50%.\n\n64\n00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:13.379\nBut it's worse than RAID 0,\nwhere it was 0%, right?\n\n65\n00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.660\nWe get everything,\nwe got 100% of our storage.\n\n66\n00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.800\nWell, RAID 5 gets better with more disks.\n\n67\n00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.100\nIf I had ten disks, I would only be\nlosing one drive's worth of storage.\n\n68\n00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.090\nSo now it's only 10% instead of\n33% like in my diagram, right?\n\n69\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.480\nSo the more drives the better with RAID 5.\n\n70\n00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.310\nBut in a way,\nyou're throwing some money at the problem.\n\n71\n00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.122\nI have to buy one extra drive\nthat I don't really get to use,\n\n72\n00:03:37.122 --> 00:03:38.707\ncuz it's consumed up by parity.\n\n73\n00:03:38.707 --> 00:03:40.707\nAnd granted,\nthe parity is not all on one disk, right?\n\n74\n00:03:40.707 --> 00:03:44.670\nIt's spread out, but\nit's the equivalent of eating up one disk.\n\n75\n00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.860\nSo in RAID 5, you lose one disk to parity.\n\n76\n00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.950\nIn RAID 6, you lose two.\n\n77\n00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.790\nSo again, we're solving a problem\nby throwing money at it.\n\n78\n00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.652\nWe're saying, hey, if I allocate\na second drive, the second drive's worth\n\n79\n00:03:56.652 --> 00:04:01.607\nof storage, here I've got four drives\nin RAID 6, so I would be losing 25%.\n\n80\n00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:04.924\nWell, actually, I'm losing two drives'\nworth, so I'd be losing 50% of my storage,\n\n81\n00:04:04.924 --> 00:04:06.510\nmuch more like a mirror.\n\n82\n00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.280\nBut if I had a ten-drive array, I'd\nonly be losing 20% of my storage, right?\n\n83\n00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.140\nJust two drives,\nout of that whole ten-drive array.\n\n84\n00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.600\nSo each of these result in\na certain amount of data loss,\n\n85\n00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.640\nor money loss, I guess.\n\n86\n00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.760\nNow, we gain redundancy.\n\n87\n00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.810\nWe do get a bit of a performance increase.\n\n88\n00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.080\nBut what if I want the best?\n\n89\n00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.160\nWhat if I want the best performance\nwith the best redundancy?\n\n90\n00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.870\nWell, RAID 5 and\nRAID 6 kind of hurt performance a bit.\n\n91\n00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.600\nSo how can I get a solution that\nreally covers all of my bases?\n\n92\n00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.560\nWell, if I throw even more money at the\nproblem, I can use what's called RAID 10.\n\n93\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.946\nRAID 10 combines RAID 1 and RAID 0.\n\n94\n00:04:50.946 --> 00:04:54.930\nAnd it creates what\nare called striped mirrors.\n\n95\n00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.390\nSo here's how it works,\nso the striped mirror.\n\n96\n00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.050\nYou have RAID 1, which is a mirror, right?\n\n97\n00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.080\nSo we take our disks and we mirror them.\n\n98\n00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.740\nThese first two disks are mirrored\ntogether, this purple mirror right here.\n\n99\n00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.990\nAnd then the next two disks are mirrored.\n\n100\n00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.770\nAnd the next two disks are mirrored.\n\n101\n00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.540\nAnd so I continually buy disks and\nmirror them.\n\n102\n00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.920\nAnd then, once they're mirrored, instead\nof seeing six disks, I now only see three.\n\n103\n00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.650\nI have three containers that are mirrors,\nwhich means I lost 50% of my storage.\n\n104\n00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.514\nI just lost 50%.\n\n105\n00:05:29.514 --> 00:05:34.380\nI'm sorry, not 50, well, yeah, sorry, I'm\nright, 50% of my storage to the mirror.\n\n106\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.590\nThen we create a stripe\nacross the mirrors.\n\n107\n00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.041\nAnd by striping across the mirrors,\n\n108\n00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:48.609\nnow I have a distributed\nperformance profile across them,\n\n109\n00:05:48.609 --> 00:05:52.189\nwithout having to calculate parity.\n\n110\n00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:54.355\nNow, that's where we really\ngain our benefit here,\n\n111\n00:05:54.355 --> 00:05:56.291\nis that we're not having\nto calculate parity.\n\n112\n00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:59.110\nAnd I kinda drew it as two stripes,\nit's really not technically two stripes.\n\n113\n00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.940\nIt's really just one stripe.\n\n114\n00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.690\nBut if I were to lose drive out\nof that stripe, the other drive\n\n115\n00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.720\njust drops right into it because it's\ngot the exact mirror of that data.\n\n116\n00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.049\nSo if I lose the drive that's got 2,\n5, and 8 on it, whoops,\n\n117\n00:06:13.049 --> 00:06:14.483\nthat's not what I wanted.\n\n118\n00:06:14.483 --> 00:06:18.360\nIf I lose the drive that's got 2,\n5, and 8 on it, or 1, 4, and 7.\n\n119\n00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.830\nHere, we'll knock that drive out.\n\n120\n00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.330\nIf I lose that, well,\nthe drive that's down below,\n\n121\n00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.500\nthis guy,\njust jumps right up to take its place.\n\n122\n00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.659\nThe challenging part is\nhighlighting the drive, I guess.\n\n123\n00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.050\nWell, anyhow, so that drive's gonna\njump right back in and take its place.\n\n124\n00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.000\nAnd so the stripe survives it.\n\n125\n00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.760\nWe're adding redundancy to the stripe.\n\n126\n00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.440\nAnd normally, with a RAID 0 stripe,\nyou don't have any redundancy.\n\n127\n00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.240\nIf you lose a disk,\nI'm now missing a chunk of that data.\n\n128\n00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.540\nThis stripe is dead in the water, right?\n\n129\n00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.240\nBut by having a mirror,\n\n130\n00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.000\nwhere I can instantly just drop that\nnew disk in, the stripe is intact.\n\n131\n00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.830\nAnd we continue to function.\n\n132\n00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.910\nAll right, now, when I first brought\nthis up, I showed two stripes.\n\n133\n00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.030\nIf one stripe fails, couldn't we\njust drop down to the other one?\n\n134\n00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.780\nYes, but here's the thing.\n\n135\n00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.590\nHow many drives can I lose in this model?\n\n136\n00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.370\nI'm giving up 50% of my storage\nbecause I have to buy two drives for\n\n137\n00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.400\nevery one's worth of storage, right?\n\n138\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.830\nSo my storage is getting really expensive.\n\n139\n00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.280\nThis might be a ten-disk array.\n\n140\n00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.760\nBut I have to have 20 disks\nbecause I'm doing mirrors.\n\n141\n00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.590\nAnd then I can create the stripe\nacross the ten mirrors, right?\n\n142\n00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.390\nSo that's where my cost\nstarts getting really high.\n\n143\n00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:36.800\nIf I lose a disk, and\nit was two separate stripes, right?\n\n144\n00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.150\nLet's say that I lose\nthis disk right here.\n\n145\n00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.360\nAnd so\nI just drop down to the bottom stripe.\n\n146\n00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.850\nWell, now I'm running\non the bottom stripe.\n\n147\n00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:47.790\nWhat happens if I lose a disk\ndown here in the bottom stripe?\n\n148\n00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.020\nNow I've lost both stripes, and I'm out.\n\n149\n00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.327\nI only lost two discs, and I'm out.\n\n150\n00:07:54.327 --> 00:07:57.333\nEven though I have all these mirrors\nin place, I can only survive two.\n\n151\n00:07:57.333 --> 00:08:01.542\nWell, if we just have one stripe,\nlike this, and\n\n152\n00:08:01.542 --> 00:08:07.200\nwhen a drive fails,\nwe just take that one drive and remove it.\n\n153\n00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.620\nAnd the other drive drops\nin to take its place.\n\n154\n00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.385\nI keep getting that in the wrong spot.\n\n155\n00:08:12.385 --> 00:08:15.950\nAnd it drops in to take its place.\n\n156\n00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:21.080\nNow in theory, I could lose any\none of these other four disks.\n\n157\n00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.620\nAnd still be fine, right.\n\n158\n00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.940\nSo, I could lose a disk that's down here,\n\n159\n00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.370\nwhich I wouldn't care about because it's\nnot actively in the stripe that I'm using.\n\n160\n00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.020\nOr I could lose a drive up here,\n\n161\n00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.450\nknowing that the one that's down on\nthe bottom can always dive back in.\n\n162\n00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.250\nAnd get that, assuming that I\nknow how to work my diagram.\n\n163\n00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.770\nSo, it'll drop back in and off I go.\n\n164\n00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.340\nSo, I can actually survive multiple\ndrive failures, I've got mirrors right?\n\n165\n00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.662\nSo, in theory I could lose three drives,\nas long as they were kinda spread out,\n\n166\n00:08:50.662 --> 00:08:52.157\nI could lose three drives.\n\n167\n00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:55.010\nAnd that gives me more redundancy\nthan I have under RAID five.\n\n168\n00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.140\n&gt;&gt; Don, where might you implement this?\n\n169\n00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.050\nYou said in the end of the last episode,\nor part I should say,\n\n170\n00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.360\nyou said, know what you're\ngonna be doing on that server.\n\n171\n00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.440\nKnow if it's a database.\n\n172\n00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.925\nWhere would you see something\nlike this in production?\n\n173\n00:09:06.925 --> 00:09:09.517\n&gt;&gt; Well this one results in\na great performance profile,\n\n174\n00:09:09.517 --> 00:09:13.235\nbecause when you read and write to it,\nyou're really just reading and writing\n\n175\n00:09:13.235 --> 00:09:16.790\nto a zero stripe, and then the controller\non the back end is mirroring it.\n\n176\n00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.250\nSo performance wise you\nget great performance, and\n\n177\n00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.960\nredundancy you get great redundancy.\n\n178\n00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.190\nSo, this is really suitable\nto be used anywhere.\n\n179\n00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.830\nBut it's really expensive, right?\n\n180\n00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.540\nBecause I got like two drives for\nevery one's worth of storage,\n\n181\n00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:32.780\nthis is the highest cost to return ratio\non it, but it gets great redundancy.\n\n182\n00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.750\nSo, usually we see this on mission\ncritical servers, that need high\n\n183\n00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:41.050\nperformance which usually means\nDatabase servers, and sometimes email.\n\n184\n00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.010\nDatabase and email,\nbecause email really is a database.\n\n185\n00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:49.006\nThat the database files themselves\ncan reside on a RAID 10 array, and\n\n186\n00:09:49.006 --> 00:09:52.015\ngreat performance and great redundancy.\n\n187\n00:09:52.015 --> 00:09:54.570\nBut the cost is high, so\nthat's kind of where we limit it.\n\n188\n00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.270\nIf you start looking at things\nlike operating system partitions.\n\n189\n00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.030\nOr even page file swap partitions.\n\n190\n00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.120\nIf you look at web servers and things.\n\n191\n00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.910\nIt's usually easier just to\nhave more of those servers,\n\n192\n00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.470\nthan it would be to use RAID\n10 on every one of them.\n\n193\n00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.540\nBecause the storage cost\nreally starts to crank up.\n\n194\n00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.990\nSo, you just scale out and\nadd more servers.\n\n195\n00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.960\nBut, on a database server you have\nto have a database master somewhere.\n\n196\n00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.000\nCan't have more than one, or at least\nnot with most database technologies.\n\n197\n00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.540\nSo having the highest level redundancy,\nand\n\n198\n00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.950\nhighest level performance is\nwhere we're gonna want it.\n\n199\n00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.600\nNow, if you've got a ton of money and\nmoney is no object,\n\n200\n00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.700\nyou can do raid ten everywhere,\nit'll run great.\n\n201\n00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.660\nYou can run it on your laptop, if you get\nenough drives jammed in the darn thing,\n\n202\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.810\nit'll do fine.\n\n203\n00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:35.280\nBut, it's expensive, and it takes space.\n\n204\n00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.680\nJust to have what is the equivalent of\na RAID 10 stripe across three drives,\n\n205\n00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.080\nI've got to have six drives.\n\n206\n00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.150\nWell, remember the server I took apart\nway back in the beginning of the series.\n\n207\n00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.900\nIt only had room for four drives.\n\n208\n00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.630\nI couldn't do six.\n\n209\n00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:53.040\nI've lost physical capacity,\njust in space.\n\n210\n00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.240\nI'm generating more temperature,\nbecause I've got more drives working.\n\n211\n00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.040\nI've got more drives that\ncould potentially fail,\n\n212\n00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.390\nthat I've got to keep under warranty,\nand do maintenance on.\n\n213\n00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:04.040\nThese are all things that make it\nmore complex, and more expensive.\n\n214\n00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.720\nBut the return is the best performance\nwe're gonna get, and the best redundancy.\n\n215\n00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.320\nThe only time we really run\ninto a problem with RAID 10,\n\n216\n00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.080\nis we lose two drives in the same mirror.\n\n217\n00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.890\nSo, there still is the potential for\nfailure.\n\n218\n00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.170\nSo for example, let me go back to my\ndiagram, If I lost two drives and\n\n219\n00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:26.450\nthey were both in the same mirror,\nnow the mirror dies.\n\n220\n00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.260\nAnd when the mirror dies,\nthe stripe has no recovery mechanism, and\n\n221\n00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.470\nso now my whole thing fails and\nit goes down.\n\n222\n00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.190\nBut, I had two drives fail and\nthey had to be in the same mirror.\n\n223\n00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.350\nI got 20 drives in this mix,\nthat's pretty unlikely.\n\n224\n00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.652\nBut what if I don't want to roll the dice,\nwell there is another technology,\n\n225\n00:11:45.652 --> 00:11:49.287\nI don't have a side for it but\ninstead of RAID 10 it is RAID 50.\n\n226\n00:11:49.287 --> 00:11:55.540\nAnd with RAID 50, instead of doing\nRAID 0 stripes, we do RAID 5 stripe.\n\n227\n00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:00.674\nSo, if we take the main diagram what\nwe would do, is basically kind of\n\n228\n00:12:00.674 --> 00:12:06.881\nre-number some of this so that it is 1,\n2 parity, 3 parity 4, parity 5, 6.\n\n229\n00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:08.685\nWe'd be doing parity blocks spread across,\nand\n\n230\n00:12:08.685 --> 00:12:11.110\nthe parity blocks should\nbe getting mirrored.\n\n231\n00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.750\nOr you could build the RAID 5 array first,\nbuild two RAID 5 arrays, and\n\n232\n00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.560\nthen mirror the RAID 5 arrays, right?\n\n233\n00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.170\nAnd that's usually what's gonna happen,\n\n234\n00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:23.880\nbecause we don't have to\ncalculate parity twice.\n\n235\n00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.220\nIn some environments, it's more efficient\nto calculate it twice, in some it's not.\n\n236\n00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.700\nAnd that's where you'll\nsee on these controllers,\n\n237\n00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.520\nwhere sometimes they'll write RAID 10,\n\n238\n00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:36.310\nwhere they're doing the RAID 1 mirrors\nfirst, and then striping across them.\n\n239\n00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:41.449\nOr you might see where they do RAID 0+1,\nnot RAID 10 anymore.\n\n240\n00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:45.266\nAnd this is where they're\nbuilding the stripes first, and\n\n241\n00:12:45.266 --> 00:12:47.670\nthen mirroring the stripes, okay?\n\n242\n00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.960\nBut, by mirroring the stripes\nif one stripe fails,\n\n243\n00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.220\nwe have to fail entirely over.\n\n244\n00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.950\nSo, we can only survive one drive failing\nper stripe, you have left redundancy.\n\n245\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.320\nSo, this is far less common.\n\n246\n00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.000\nNormally, you're gonna see Raid\n10 if better at redundancy.\n\n247\n00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.910\nBut with Raid 50, you can see RAID 0 + 5,\nyou can see RAID 5 + 0.\n\n248\n00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.910\nThey both equal out to about\nthe same level of redundancy.\n\n249\n00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:16.900\nBut typically doing the RAID 5 first,\nand then doing the 0 across the RAID\n\n250\n00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:21.260\n5 raises where you're gonna get the most\nredundancy on those so you'll see RAID 50.\n\n251\n00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.640\nNot every controller supports that.\n\n252\n00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.690\nI can't remember from\n\n253\n00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.060\nthe episode of the server that I\nhad whether it supported it or not.\n\n254\n00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.630\nBut, it is another one that's out there.\n\n255\n00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:32.466\nSo, what we're really choosing when we\nlook at this stuff, is performance, cost,\n\n256\n00:13:32.466 --> 00:13:35.340\nand redundancy, right?\n\n257\n00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.730\nThose are the three things,\n\n258\n00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.150\nthat are gonna influence which\none of these that we choose.\n\n259\n00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.710\nIf I'm really concerned about performance,\nI can pay a lot of money, and\n\n260\n00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:46.976\nget a Raid 10 array and have really great\nperformance and still maintain redundancy.\n\n261\n00:13:46.976 --> 00:13:51.174\nOr if I don't care about redundancy,\nI can do RAID 0, get great performance and\n\n262\n00:13:51.174 --> 00:13:55.249\nnot have the cost and data loss that I\nhave with the other RAID types because I'm\n\n263\n00:13:55.249 --> 00:13:59.922\nnot doing parity, I'm not giving up things\nto a mirror, it's just straight up RAID 0.\n\n264\n00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:01.385\nI get no redundancy, though.\n\n265\n00:14:01.385 --> 00:14:05.050\nYou have to pick and choose which\none is gonna meet your solution.\n\n266\n00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.884\nIt's not a one-size-fits-all.\n\n267\n00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.490\nNow, the other thing we need to\nthink about as we build these up,\n\n268\n00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.520\nI've said multiple times, hey my diagrams,\nI'm using like three drives.\n\n269\n00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.660\nBut in real life I might use 10 or 20 or\n\n270\n00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:21.220\n60 drives, however many it is I've got,\nthey're gonna this array.\n\n271\n00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.909\nAnd when you build an array\nacross the drives,\n\n272\n00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.140\nit's gonna show up as one big disk.\n\n273\n00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.120\nNow, if I go to the store right now and\nI try and buy a hard drive,\n\n274\n00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.110\nwhat's the biggest hard drive I can get?\n\n275\n00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.800\nMaybe 8 terabyte?\n\n276\n00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.520\nIs that right, Wes, eight?\n\n277\n00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think right now,\nthat's about right.\n\n278\n00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.330\n&gt;&gt; So, they made a 8 terabyte drive.\n\n279\n00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.310\n&gt;&gt; Right, so can my operating\nsystem handle an 8 terabyte drive?\n\n280\n00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.080\nMore than likely,\nmost modern operating systems can.\n\n281\n00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.450\nBut if i have 10 eight terabyte drives,\nand\n\n282\n00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:53.440\nI do a RAID 0 across them,\nI now have 180 terabyte drive.\n\n283\n00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.428\nCan my operating system\nhandle an 80 terabyte drive?\n\n284\n00:14:55.428 --> 00:14:58.050\nMaybe, maybe not.\n\n285\n00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.930\nMaybe my file system isn't able\nto handle drives that large.\n\n286\n00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:03.140\nSo, we've always got to\nthink about capacity too.\n\n287\n00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.410\nWhen you start doing RAID 10 and RAID 5,\nyou're giving up some of that capacity,\n\n288\n00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.420\nit shrinks it down.\n\n289\n00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.450\nWhen you do RAID 0,\nyou get full access though.\n\n290\n00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.040\nAnd you end up with some really,\nreally large drives, and\n\n291\n00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.050\nyour operating system might not like that.\n\n292\n00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:16.510\nSo, you don't have to memorize this for\nthe exam.\n\n293\n00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:19.950\nBut just to kind of reinforce my\npoint here, I made a little chart\n\n294\n00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.150\nwith some of the common file systems,\nand what their maxes are.\n\n295\n00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.200\nAnd their maxes are typically pretty high.\n\n296\n00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.220\nBut sometimes they aren't.\n\n297\n00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.390\nWhen you look at the maximum volume size,\nand you go down this list\n\n298\n00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:36.750\nyou'll see like FAT32 for Windows has\na maximum volume size of eight terabytes.\n\n299\n00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:40.100\nSo, if I build something that's bigger\nthan eight terabytes I can't use FAT32,\n\n300\n00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.130\nit's not gonna be able to handle that,\non the volume side.\n\n301\n00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.600\nI might have a virtual\ndrive that's that big but\n\n302\n00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.620\nI can't just partition\nit in one big partition.\n\n303\n00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.500\nI've got to break it up into smaller ones,\nthat are less than eight terabytes.\n\n304\n00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.235\nAnd there's other ones that\nhave similar limitations.\n\n305\n00:15:53.235 --> 00:15:56.259\nLike ext2 and ext3 at 32 terabytes, but\n\n306\n00:15:56.259 --> 00:16:00.516\nif I just upgrade to ext4 I can\ngo all the way up to one exabyte.\n\n307\n00:16:00.516 --> 00:16:02.298\nI can go to a huge amount of storage.\n\n308\n00:16:02.298 --> 00:16:04.980\nAnd you'll see some that get\njust insanely large, like ZFS.\n\n309\n00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.020\nThey can get all the way up\nto 256 zettabytes, right?\n\n310\n00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.420\nIt's just a massive amount of space.\n\n311\n00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:14.590\nThat's why people love UFS, but\nit's tied up in Oracle's licensing,\n\n312\n00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.420\nso most of us don't get to use it.\n\n313\n00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:21.730\nInstead, we deal with things like EXT4 and\nEXFS, BTRFS is coming along and\n\n314\n00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:26.950\nthose all allow us to access much,\nmuch larger disk sizes and so on.\n\n315\n00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.110\nSo as you start creating these containers,\n\n316\n00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.460\nthese virtual disks,\nthat a RAID controller makes.\n\n317\n00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.220\nYou might not wanna go some large.\n\n318\n00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.010\nYou might wanna do smaller ones.\n\n319\n00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:40.170\nSo I might have 20 disks, but I take\nten and put them in an array of five.\n\n320\n00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.210\nAll right I take another ten and\nput them in another array of five and\n\n321\n00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.600\ncreate smaller containers,\n\n322\n00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.070\nthat my operating system can handle\na little better, right Jill?\n\n323\n00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.000\nAlways keep that in mind.\n\n324\n00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.890\nYour capacity numbers can get really,\nreally big with this stuff.\n\n325\n00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.420\nThe other thing is bus type limitations.\n\n326\n00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.070\nThat we have to use traditional SCSI.\n\n327\n00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.730\nYou can have one SCSI cable that\ncan run up to 14 drives, right.\n\n328\n00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.170\nOne for the controller and\nthen the rest gets eaten up by drives.\n\n329\n00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:06.110\nSo up to 15 drives on\nthat one SCSI connector.\n\n330\n00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:11.820\nBut when you do SATA and SAS they're\nserial, serial ATA, serial attached SCSI.\n\n331\n00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.680\nSATA and\nSAS it's one drive per connection.\n\n332\n00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.260\nAnd so how many connections\ncan you physically have inside\n\n333\n00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.642\nof a server on a rate controller?\n\n334\n00:17:20.642 --> 00:17:22.660\nThat's gonna limit the amount\nof drives that you can have.\n\n335\n00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.520\nAnd it's gonna limit\nthe amount of throughput.\n\n336\n00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.620\nIf I've got a rate controller\nthat's plugged into a PCI-E port,\n\n337\n00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.170\nhow much data can I move\nthrough a PCI-E port?\n\n338\n00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.870\nIf I've got five hard drives, and\nthey're all six gigabit drives,\n\n339\n00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.830\nthat means I could be moving\nup to 30 gigabit of data.\n\n340\n00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.710\nDo I have that throughput\navailability on my PCIE card?\n\n341\n00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:42.950\nMaybe, maybe not.\n\n342\n00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.300\nRight, it depends on which\nlevel of PCIE I have.\n\n343\n00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:49.280\nAnd if I have 20 drives and I'm trying\nto write to all 20 at the same time.\n\n344\n00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.040\nCan one PCIE port handle that?\n\n345\n00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.350\nMaybe, maybe not, right?\n\n346\n00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.450\nI need to understand my drives and\n\n347\n00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:58.910\ntheir speed, and the port that the rate\ncontroller is plugged into and it's speed.\n\n348\n00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:03.660\nThere come a time where I can't handle\nthe amount of drives that I've got, and\n\n349\n00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.920\nI have to create a bottle neck.\n\n350\n00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.100\nThe rate controller slows down our access,\nand\n\n351\n00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.100\nthat's where storage\narea networks come in.\n\n352\n00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.440\nSANs have controllers in them that\nare specifically designed to handle huge\n\n353\n00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.700\namounts of throughput, cuz they're not\nexpecting one server to be connected.\n\n354\n00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.840\nThey're expecting 10, 20,\n30 servers to be connected.\n\n355\n00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.170\nSo it's handling the workload for\nall of those systems.\n\n356\n00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.240\nAnd so their throughput is phenomenal,\nthrough the roof.\n\n357\n00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.780\nBut when you're dealing\nwith internal drives, and\n\n358\n00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.980\nthe RAID arrays you build there,\nthey're not designed for that level.\n\n359\n00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.680\nBut you've only got so much storage space\ninside of a physical server anyway, so\n\n360\n00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.080\nit's not normally a problem.\n\n361\n00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.270\nBut if you add on external arrays.\n\n362\n00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.850\nYou can do that.\n\n363\n00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.520\nYou can buy these external drive\ntrays to stick on the servers.\n\n364\n00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.910\nYou can saturate your bus.\n\n365\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:46.020\nSo you've always gotta keep\nyour bus speed in mind.\n\n366\n00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.210\nOther things.\n\n367\n00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.160\nYou can do RAID across SSDs, right.\n\n368\n00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:53.230\nIn my example, I never mentioned that\nthey were SSD or spinning disks.\n\n369\n00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:56.690\nWith spinning disks, you have that\nlimitation of the rotations per minute,\n\n370\n00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:57.910\nthe RPMs, right?\n\n371\n00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:03.071\nAnd if I have 7,200 RPM drives, and\n5,400 RPM drives and 10,000 RPM,\n\n372\n00:19:03.071 --> 00:19:08.050\nand 15,000 RPM drives, I usually\ndon't want to mix and match those.\n\n373\n00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:11.630\nIf I have an array, I want the array\nto be built off of common speed drives,\n\n374\n00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.540\nso I get consistent read and\nwrite performance.\n\n375\n00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.970\nIf you mix and match, it causes a problem.\n\n376\n00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.100\nSo what we normally do is we set\nup what's called tiered storage.\n\n377\n00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.790\nTiered storage is where maybe we've\ngot a couple of 15,000 rpm drives, and\n\n378\n00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:23.790\nthe rest of them are 7200 rpm.\n\n379\n00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:29.370\nYour rate controller might support\ntiered storage where you can say,\n\n380\n00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:34.160\nput frequently accessed content\non the 15,000 rpm drives, and\n\n381\n00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.050\nput less frequently or infrequently\naccessed data on the 7200 rpm drives.\n\n382\n00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.590\nThere's RAID controllers to support that.\n\n383\n00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:43.570\nAlmost every SAN supports that but there's\nplenty of RAID controllers that do too.\n\n384\n00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.070\nYou can create tiered storage.\n\n385\n00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:50.170\nSo technically separate arrays and\nit's just managing where the data resides.\n\n386\n00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:53.000\nYou might have a handful of SSD's and\n\n387\n00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.090\nthe rest of your drives\nare all spinning disks.\n\n388\n00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:57.810\nThat's a great example where\nyou'd use tiered storage.\n\n389\n00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.720\nI don't have enough SSD for\nall my data, but\n\n390\n00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.800\nmy frequently accessed\ndata can go into the SSD.\n\n391\n00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.740\nAnd that will improve performance.\n\n392\n00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.980\nThat's a term you'll start to hear a lot.\n\n393\n00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.770\nIt's not on the exam objectives,\nbut it is something to be aware of.\n\n394\n00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:10.860\nI guess drive RPM is on\nthe exam objectives.\n\n395\n00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.120\nWe'll lump it under that [LAUGH].\n\n396\n00:20:13.535 --> 00:20:15.180\nOkay, the last thing that\nI really need to mention,\n\n397\n00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.090\nbecause we've already talked about\nwhether things can be hot swapped.\n\n398\n00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:19.570\nActually I have two things.\n\n399\n00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.340\nI need to talk about battery\nbacked right cache controllers and\n\n400\n00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.820\nI need to talk about hot spares and\ncold spares, right?\n\n401\n00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.910\nWhen I was talking about RAID 5,\nI mentioned how,\n\n402\n00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:32.210\nif we go back to my diagram,\nif I lose a drive.\n\n403\n00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.420\nSo if I lose this drive right here,\n\n404\n00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:39.230\nand I pop in a brand-new disk,\nit's gonna start rebuilding.\n\n405\n00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.380\nAnd while it's rebuilding, I'm at risk,\n\n406\n00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.490\nbecause if I lose another\ndisk I lose the whole array.\n\n407\n00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.470\nRAID 5 can't support two drives failing.\n\n408\n00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:47.110\nIt can only support one.\n\n409\n00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:48.880\nWell here's the thing.\n\n410\n00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.170\nI wanna minimize that rebuild\ntime as much as I can.\n\n411\n00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.560\nBut if these drives are a terrabyte or\nlarger, the rebuild can take quite awhile.\n\n412\n00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.410\nIt's a slow operation.\n\n413\n00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.869\nSo if I have a drive fail\nin the middle of the night.\n\n414\n00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.920\nIt could be sitting there with\na failed drive all night long.\n\n415\n00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.540\nAnd then I come in the morning, I'm like\nwhat's that red light on the server?\n\n416\n00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.700\nAnd then I go, and I look and I got a\ndrive fail, let me go ahead and swap that.\n\n417\n00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.990\nAnd I swap the drive out and\nit starts rebuilding.\n\n418\n00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.970\nWell meanwhile,\n\n419\n00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:21.680\nthe failure happened six hours before\nI just didn't know it, I wasn't here,\n\n420\n00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.420\nI didn't see it, and then I change out\nthe drive and now we start to rebuild.\n\n421\n00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.310\nWouldn't it have been nice,\n\n422\n00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:32.000\nif I had another drive already\nsitting there and waiting.\n\n423\n00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.920\nNow, the idea of a spare\ndrive is not a new concept.\n\n424\n00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.770\nYou might have a spare drive sitting\naround that is just waiting for\n\n425\n00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.380\nthe opportunity to jump in and take over.\n\n426\n00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:48.540\nNow when you do that,\nit's one of those things where\n\n427\n00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:53.700\nyou have to determine how fast\na response you want on this stuff.\n\n428\n00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.490\nSo when we talk about a failure happening,\nif I want the rebuild to\n\n429\n00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:03.340\nhappen immediately,\nwhat I need is called a hot spare.\n\n430\n00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:07.150\nI can have an extra disk that's\nalready plugged into the server\n\n431\n00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:08.830\nthat's not carrying any data, right.\n\n432\n00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.880\nIt's just sitting there and it's empty.\n\n433\n00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:16.030\nSo technically instead of\nblue I would have grey,\n\n434\n00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:20.019\nmore grey disks that were stuck\nbeneath it and so on like this.\n\n435\n00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:28.580\nAnd these discs would just be sitting,\nwaiting for me to do something, right?\n\n436\n00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:35.450\nAnd when I have a failure, this one\nwill jump in and take it over, right?\n\n437\n00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.070\nIf it's a hot spare,\n\n438\n00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:41.490\nthat means the drive is physically\ninserted in the server and waiting.\n\n439\n00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:46.660\nAnd when one of these guys fails, like\nif this drive were to disappear, it can\n\n440\n00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:52.550\nimmediately take this disk and start\nrebuilding block four, and block six.\n\n441\n00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.790\nI just lost block four and block six, so\nit can jump in and start to rebuild those.\n\n442\n00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.540\nIt doesn't have to wait for\nme to come in in the morning.\n\n443\n00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.830\nSo if the failure happens at one AM,\nthe hot spare is already waiting.\n\n444\n00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.710\nIt jumps in and\nstarts to rebuild right away.\n\n445\n00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:07.920\nThat's gonna minimize the time it\ntakes to recover from the failure and\n\n446\n00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.310\nminimize my exposure,\nthat if I lose a second disk,\n\n447\n00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:14.070\nwell maybe it's already finished\nthe rebuild by that point.\n\n448\n00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.250\nThis is gonna minimize it.\n\n449\n00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.960\nA hot spare's a great way to do that.\n\n450\n00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.100\n&gt;&gt; Don, so let me see if I can\nguess what the cold spare here is.\n\n451\n00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:24.930\nDoes that mean I'm taking a trip out of\nthe server closet to maybe an equipment\n\n452\n00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.260\nstorage room to find an extra hard drive\nand come back to the server or storage.\n\n453\n00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:33.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if I have ten servers and I want\nto do hot spares, I got ten hot spares.\n\n454\n00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.065\nThat's ten hard drives that\nare sitting there doing nothing.\n\n455\n00:23:36.065 --> 00:23:40.130\nTen hard drives that I paid for\nthat are sitting there doing nothing.\n\n456\n00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.700\nThey're spinning, so eventually they'll\ngo bad, but they're not doing anything.\n\n457\n00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.889\nAnd I might not have a lot of\nslots on the servers anyway, so\n\n458\n00:23:45.889 --> 00:23:47.602\nthese are all things\nthat I need to consider.\n\n459\n00:23:47.602 --> 00:23:50.287\nSo instead,\nif they're ten identical servers and\n\n460\n00:23:50.287 --> 00:23:54.782\nthey're all using the same drives, I could\njust buy one spare, or maybe two spares,\n\n461\n00:23:54.782 --> 00:23:56.731\nand stick them on the top of the rack.\n\n462\n00:23:56.731 --> 00:23:59.114\nOr stick them in a storage closet or\nwhatever.\n\n463\n00:23:59.114 --> 00:23:59.886\nTheir cold.\n\n464\n00:23:59.886 --> 00:24:00.522\nThey're not spinning.\n\n465\n00:24:00.522 --> 00:24:01.315\nThey're sitting on a shelf.\n\n466\n00:24:01.315 --> 00:24:03.710\nThey'll last a lot longer\ncuz they're not spinning.\n\n467\n00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.559\nRight, they're not actively being used.\n\n468\n00:24:05.559 --> 00:24:08.844\nAnd when a failure happens, I can see\nthat I can just go and grab the drive and\n\n469\n00:24:08.844 --> 00:24:10.200\nswap it out.\n\n470\n00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.590\nNice part about a cold spar is you\ndon't need as many of them, so\n\n471\n00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.910\nit's less expensive.\n\n472\n00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.230\nBut the negative part is we go\nright back to my original problem.\n\n473\n00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:20.067\nIf a failure happens at 1 AM,\nwho's there to swap the drive?\n\n474\n00:24:20.067 --> 00:24:21.897\nNot me, I'm asleep.\n\n475\n00:24:21.897 --> 00:24:24.240\nBut when I come in in the morning,\nI can go ahead and take care of it.\n\n476\n00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.250\nNow, what if I didn't\neven have a cold spare?\n\n477\n00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.660\nI come in in the morning,\nI see the drive has failed, and I go and\n\n478\n00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.430\ndo a warranty call and\nI get a new drive the next day.\n\n479\n00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:33.380\nI've got to wait an entire day.\n\n480\n00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.460\nOr I've got to drive down to the store and\nbuy one.\n\n481\n00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.250\nAnd maybe I don't want to do that\nright now, so I do it at lunch time.\n\n482\n00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:41.410\nAgain, continually increasing\nthe length to recovery time.\n\n483\n00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:45.630\nSo, if we can have a hot spare, that's\nthe best, you get the fastest recovery.\n\n484\n00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.120\nIf you have a cold spare,\nat least you got the drive in-house, and\n\n485\n00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.310\nyou don't have to go out get it.\n\n486\n00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:52.320\nSo those are two alternatives that\nhelp us kinda correct for that.\n\n487\n00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.360\nWhere it really is neat when you\nhave things like RAID ten arrays.\n\n488\n00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.210\nAgain, throwing money at the problem.\n\n489\n00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:02.440\nIf I've got hot spares along with this,\nI can survive many drive failures.\n\n490\n00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:08.040\nWhen you lose a drive in a mirror,\nrebuilding a mirror is super easy, cuz\n\n491\n00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:13.698\nwe're just copying everything on the first\ndrive down to the new drive, that's it.\n\n492\n00:25:13.698 --> 00:25:17.440\nRebuilding RAID five is harder because\nyou're having to calculate parity,\n\n493\n00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.900\nwe're having to do math,\nnot just copy stuff.\n\n494\n00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:24.130\nI've gotta read from the two disks that\nare still valid to build parity for\n\n495\n00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.710\nwhat's missing or\nI better read from a valid disk and\n\n496\n00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.330\na parity disk to rebuild\nthe valid disk that's missing.\n\n497\n00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.040\nSo that takes math, it's harder for\nthe controller to do,\n\n498\n00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.410\nand it takes longer, right?\n\n499\n00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:37.770\nBut as long as you've got a budget,\nyou can keep throwing drives at it, and\n\n500\n00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:40.340\neventually you'll get to a point where\nyou have instantaneous recovery,\n\n501\n00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.160\nthere's no big deal, right?\n\n502\n00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.240\nBut most of us are working\nwithin budget constraints and so\n\n503\n00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:44.970\nwe don't have that option.\n\n504\n00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:49.350\nAll right the other thing I wanted to\ntalk about was the caching controller.\n\n505\n00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.000\nWhen you write to these disks.\n\n506\n00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.310\nIf I'm writing to a RAID 5 array,\nit's gotta calculate parity, right?\n\n507\n00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:55.140\nI'm changing the disk.\n\n508\n00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.470\nIt's gotta calculate parity.\n\n509\n00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:59.340\nIf I'm writing to a mirror,\nit's gotta write twice.\n\n510\n00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.760\nIf I'm writing to a RAID zero stripe,\nit's gotta take the data, break it up, and\n\n511\n00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.070\nthen write simultaneously\nacross the disks.\n\n512\n00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.750\nWell, all those operations take time.\n\n513\n00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:10.480\nAnd you're operating system is\ngonna send to the right command,\n\n514\n00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:15.040\nand it's gonna wait for the hard drive\nto respond back and say yep, done,\n\n515\n00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.490\nI wrote it, and\nthe operating system can move on.\n\n516\n00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:21.450\nSo the operating system actually\npauses working with that data.\n\n517\n00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:25.230\nThink about a word processor,\nif I mean Microsoft Word, and\n\n518\n00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:28.490\nI hit the Save button,\ncan I type while it's saving?\n\n519\n00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:29.450\nNo.\n\n520\n00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:33.620\nWhile it's saving it stops me from typing\nand it writes to the hard drive and when\n\n521\n00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.940\nit's done writing and it knows that it's\nsaved then it lets me start typing again.\n\n522\n00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.465\nNot every software does that but\nWord's a good example that does.\n\n523\n00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:47.510\nNow with a raid controller if\nit has an extra memory on it.\n\n524\n00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:51.260\nIt can take the write\noperation that I just did, and\n\n525\n00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.090\nit can write to the RAM\non the raid controller.\n\n526\n00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.650\nWhich is way faster than\nwriting the physical disc.\n\n527\n00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.410\nIf you write to the RAM on\nthat raid controller, and\n\n528\n00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:01.240\nsend the operating system\na message saying hey I'm done.\n\n529\n00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.380\nAnd the operating system can move on,\nway faster.\n\n530\n00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.360\nBut it hasn't actually\nwritten to the disk yet.\n\n531\n00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.460\nAnd in the background, the RAID controller\ncan calculate parity and write out and\n\n532\n00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.000\nall that stuff.\n\n533\n00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.900\nThe operating system\ndoesn't have to wait on it.\n\n534\n00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:18.000\nThat makes our OS faster,\nbut it opens us up to risk.\n\n535\n00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.660\nWhat if I lose power?\n\n536\n00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.540\nMy operating system thinks that\nI saved the Word document.\n\n537\n00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.620\nIt thinks that I wrote to the hard drive.\n\n538\n00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.840\nWhen in reality,\nthe RAID controller kinda lied to me.\n\n539\n00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.060\nIt wrote to its memory,\nit didn't write to the hard drive yet.\n\n540\n00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:33.210\nAnd if I lose power,\nwhat happens to RAM when it loses power?\n\n541\n00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:34.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Don, we're in trouble there.\n\n542\n00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:38.340\nI mean, no power, we lose all of that\ninformation, and we don't get it back.\n\n543\n00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nRAM does electronic refresh, right?\n\n544\n00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:43.610\nIt's gotta have electricity to keep\nrewriting what's in each little\n\n545\n00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.880\ncell inside of, or each row,\nI think it does it by row.\n\n546\n00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.720\nAnyhow, inside of the memory.\n\n547\n00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.329\nWell, the RAM that's on a RAID\nuses the same way, we lose power,\n\n548\n00:27:50.329 --> 00:27:51.382\nwe lose what's in there.\n\n549\n00:27:51.382 --> 00:27:54.319\nIt lied to the Operating System,\nand told the OS we were done,\n\n550\n00:27:54.319 --> 00:27:55.740\nwhen in reality we weren't.\n\n551\n00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.240\nNow on a workstation it's\nprobably not a big deal,\n\n552\n00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.920\ncuz the OS is failing too, right?\n\n553\n00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.230\nBut on a server,\nthese are network operations.\n\n554\n00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.480\nWe might have told another\nserver that it was done.\n\n555\n00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.140\nMaybe this is a financial transaction,\nand we said yeah,\n\n556\n00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:10.740\nwe wrote it to the database But we didn't,\nand now you really get in trouble.\n\n557\n00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.430\nSo the RAID controllers that are worth\ntheir salt, the ones that cost a good\n\n558\n00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:19.400\namount of money, they have a rechargeable\nbattery right on the RAID controller.\n\n559\n00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:24.770\nSo if your server loses power, they can\nhold what's in the RAM on that card for\n\n560\n00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:25.390\nweeks on end.\n\n561\n00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:30.320\nAnd as long as you get power restored to\nthe system, as soon as it comes back up,\n\n562\n00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.680\nit will finish writing to the disks.\n\n563\n00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.170\nSo what it told the OS it did,\nit actually does.\n\n564\n00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.260\nNow, if your rate controller\ndoesn't have a battery on it.\n\n565\n00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.310\nAnd it has right caching.\n\n566\n00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:42.990\nOn a server, you'll want to turn that off.\n\n567\n00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.150\nOn a desktop, you might not care.\n\n568\n00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:45.410\nBut on a server,\nyou'll want to turn that off.\n\n569\n00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:47.840\nSo just be aware that the ones\nthat are really worth it.\n\n570\n00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.880\nThe rate controllers are large.\n\n571\n00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.300\nUsually cuz they've got\na battery stuck right on them.\n\n572\n00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.360\nAnd it's typically rechargeable so\nit's constantly charging itself and\n\n573\n00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.570\nit's got a lifetime, it's got to be\nmaintained and replaced over time.\n\n574\n00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.250\n&gt;&gt; That was gonna be my question because I\nwas gonna ask is this like one of those,\n\n575\n00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:05.590\nwhat is it, three volt watch\nbattery that we have for Sea Moss?\n\n576\n00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:09.150\nThese are actually real rechargeable and\nbig batteries Usually yes,\n\n577\n00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:13.720\nthe CR2032 batteries you're talking\nabout have a three year lifetime and\n\n578\n00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.980\nthey hold their own electricity when\nyou buy them and over time it degrades.\n\n579\n00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.390\n&gt;&gt; These are rechargeables.\n\n580\n00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.550\nWell, think about your cell phone or\nyour laptop.\n\n581\n00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:25.610\nWhat would happen if you plugged it into a\nwall outlet and you just left it charging\n\n582\n00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:30.630\nfor three years, never drained it,\njust for three years it ran.\n\n583\n00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:32.030\nThe batteries go bad, right?\n\n584\n00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.740\nThey can't handle that for\na long period of time.\n\n585\n00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.560\nNow if you're constantly having power\noutages and draining the battery and\n\n586\n00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.210\ncharging it back up, that's different.\n\n587\n00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:42.390\nBut some of them will actually do\nconditioning, but they'll never take it\n\n588\n00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:44.799\nall the way done, because what happens if\nyou lose power while it was conditioning?\n\n589\n00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.520\nNow you might as well not have it, right?\n\n590\n00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.090\nSo they do go bad and\n\n591\n00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:52.030\nthey usually have alerting built into\nthe system that warns you of that so\n\n592\n00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:56.240\nyou can replace it, they typically use\nbatteries that are rated for three years,\n\n593\n00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:00.090\nbut if you run a server for longer than\nthree years you become at risk yourself.\n\n594\n00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:01.990\nSo just be aware of that, and\n\n595\n00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:05.910\non battery backed right cache controllers,\nthey usually have different sizes And\n\n596\n00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:11.210\nit usually doesn't sound like a whole lot,\nlike 256 megabytes.\n\n597\n00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:12.450\nAnd you're thinking wow, 256?\n\n598\n00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:13.310\nWhat is this, 1997?\n\n599\n00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:18.410\nWell, when you think about how we write\nto a RAID array and how quickly we can\n\n600\n00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:22.400\nget that data on there, especially with\nSSD's, you don't need a whole lot cached.\n\n601\n00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.810\nTo be able to get that\nperformance level up.\n\n602\n00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:28.950\nSo you won't typically see gigs and\ngigs of memory on a RAID controller,\n\n603\n00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:32.420\nit's usually just megabytes of memory\ncuz that's all you really need.\n\n604\n00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:34.700\n&gt;&gt; One of the things you had mentioned\nthere, Don, is you said, for\n\n605\n00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.865\ninstance If one of your CMOS\nbatteries starts to die,\n\n606\n00:30:37.865 --> 00:30:40.435\nwe know that the time clock's\nnot gonna stay the same.\n\n607\n00:30:40.435 --> 00:30:43.015\nEvery time we reboot a device,\nit's gonna have a different time.\n\n608\n00:30:43.015 --> 00:30:46.345\nIs it just a warning on the controller\nthat it's gonna let you know that\n\n609\n00:30:46.345 --> 00:30:50.675\nthe battery's failing or is there some\nother condition that we might see\n\n610\n00:30:50.675 --> 00:30:53.215\nbeforehand, if it didn't have an alarm?\n\n611\n00:30:53.215 --> 00:30:54.735\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like on Dells.\n\n612\n00:30:54.735 --> 00:30:56.015\nDell's servers, the powered servers,\n\n613\n00:30:56.015 --> 00:30:58.930\nthey usually have a little\nLCD screen on the front.\n\n614\n00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:02.230\nAnd so when that battery starts to\nget degraded, it'll flash amber and\n\n615\n00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:06.160\nit'll have a message on there letting\nyou know the PERC battery is degraded.\n\n616\n00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.390\nSo they give you a very visual warning.\n\n617\n00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:11.610\nHPE has a little light that\nlights up on the front of theirs.\n\n618\n00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:15.810\nBut they all have management software that\nyou can run to be able to reach out and\n\n619\n00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:16.440\ncontrol that.\n\n620\n00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:20.190\nSo like HP's Insight software\nthat monitors all the servers or\n\n621\n00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:25.490\nreports on the hardware, you can report on\nfan speeds and RAID battery controller,\n\n622\n00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:30.730\nthe battery backed right cache\ncontroller status, it's a mouthful.\n\n623\n00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:32.390\nBut it can report back and\nlet you know, and\n\n624\n00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.720\nyou can spot it ahead of time typically.\n\n625\n00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.370\nSometimes you don't necessarily see it,\nthat's where you need to keep a schedule.\n\n626\n00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.270\nIt's kinda like changing\nthe oil in your car,\n\n627\n00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.970\nyour car might not warn you that it's\ntime to change oil, but you know, hey,\n\n628\n00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.460\nit's been 3,000 miles,\nut;s time to change the oil.\n\n629\n00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.520\nSo you have to track that on your servers,\ntoo.\n\n630\n00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.280\nWe'll talk about asset management in\nanother episode, and that's what this is\n\n631\n00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.810\nall really a part of is routine\nmaintenance and asset management.\n\n632\n00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:57.180\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nlot of great information, Don.\n\n633\n00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.270\nDoes look like we're coming to\nthe end of another episode.\n\n634\n00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:03.020\nAnd judging by our objectives here,\nlooks like you covered it really well,\n\n635\n00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:06.860\nbut Is there anything else that you\nmight want to throw into this episode?\n\n636\n00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.710\nAnd maybe any words of wisdom or\ncaution, maybe,\n\n637\n00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:13.510\nwhen it comes to RAID arrays inside\nof your server environments?\n\n638\n00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:15.600\n&gt;&gt; The only other thing that I\nhaven't really mentioned is that when\n\n639\n00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.170\nyou build a RAID array, you have\ntypically the option to scrub the disks.\n\n640\n00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.070\nYou don't have to do that,\nbut when you scrub the disks,\n\n641\n00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.650\nit makes sure they're\nall in complete sync.\n\n642\n00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:27.660\nIt writes ones and zeros to all\nthe sectors to get them all evened out.\n\n643\n00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.800\nBy doing that it can improve\nparity calculations in some cases.\n\n644\n00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.210\nSo it's a good idea to do the scrub.\n\n645\n00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:34.610\nIt takes a long time.\n\n646\n00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:35.530\nYou can skip it.\n\n647\n00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:36.660\nMost systems will let you skip it.\n\n648\n00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.970\nSome systems don't even do it.\n\n649\n00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:40.710\nBut on the higher end controllers,\nthey'll almost always offer to scrub.\n\n650\n00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:43.200\nAnd it's a good idea to do that\nwhen you build out an array.\n\n651\n00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.660\nJust a word to the wise.\n\n652\n00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.080\n&gt;&gt; Great piece of advice there, Don.\n\n653\n00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.540\nThanks for being with us today.\n\n654\n00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.150\nAnd thank you, the viewer watching.\n\n655\n00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:54.390\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.511\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.511 --> 00:00:11.330\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.730\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.400\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.130\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\nthrough our series in CompTIA's Server+.\n\n9\n00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.390\nAnd joining us in the studios again\nis none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.780\nHi, Don, how you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.950\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing swell, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.120\nAnd in this episode,\nwe're going to be tackling a neat topic.\n\n13\n00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.724\nWe're going to talk about\nstorage technologies.\n\n14\n00:00:30.724 --> 00:00:35.870\nWe've been focusing on drives and\npartitions and rate arrays all this time.\n\n15\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.530\nNow we're just gonna look at where\nwe put all these things, right?\n\n16\n00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.680\nYou got all these disks,\nwhere are they gonna go?\n\n17\n00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.170\nWhen you buy a server,\nit's probably got some room for\n\n18\n00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.680\nsome hard drives right in the server.\n\n19\n00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.720\nBut most servers these days\nare only 1U in size, one rack unit.\n\n20\n00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.690\nWhich means 1.75 inches tall, and that's\nnot a whole lot of room for hard drives.\n\n21\n00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.730\nSo finding a server\nthese days with room for\n\n22\n00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.120\nmore than even eight disks is a rarity.\n\n23\n00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.352\nSo if we need more,\nwhere the heck are these drives going?\n\n24\n00:01:02.352 --> 00:01:03.650\nSo that's what we're\ngonna look at right here.\n\n25\n00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.540\nSome of the different places,\ndifferent ways of arranging storage and\n\n26\n00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.671\nmaking it available on our\nnetwork in a data center.\n\n27\n00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:13.589\nGoing beyond a work station\nwhich has far less options.\n\n28\n00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.470\nAll right, so let's get started\nwith really the easiest solution,\n\n29\n00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.800\nwhich is what's called direct\nattached storage, or DAS.\n\n30\n00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.060\nYou'll hear DAS, NAS,\nSAN all these crazy acronyms, but\n\n31\n00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.950\nDAS is really just talking about good\nold fashioned, direct attached storage,\n\n32\n00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.270\nwhere you have a server and it's got\ndrive bays right on the front of it,\n\n33\n00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.020\npossibly inside, and\nyou pop the drives in.\n\n34\n00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.190\nAnd that's it.\n\n35\n00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.030\nNow on a positive side, direct attached\nstorage is usually directly attached.\n\n36\n00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.220\nIt runs right into the motherboard.\n\n37\n00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.920\nYou get the highest performance possible\nbecause it's wired right into the system.\n\n38\n00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.280\nOn a negative side,\nyou don't have a ton of room.\n\n39\n00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.500\nCooling can be an issue.\n\n40\n00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.680\nYou have limitations as to\nhow many drives you can have.\n\n41\n00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.180\nAnd those drives are tied\nto just that one server.\n\n42\n00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.650\nSo let me give you an example.\n\n43\n00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.620\nLet's say I have\na virtualization farm set up.\n\n44\n00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.985\nSo I've got a VMHOST01, 2, 3 and 4.\n\n45\n00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:13.180\nAnd each of these virtual machine hosts\nhas direct attached storage, right?\n\n46\n00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.020\nMaybe 6 terabytes of storage available for\nvirtual machines.\n\n47\n00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.343\nAnd I have a virtual machine like\nWEB01 that's running on VMHOST01.\n\n48\n00:02:21.343 --> 00:02:25.980\nSo this is the guest, WEB01,\nrunning on the host VMHOST01.\n\n49\n00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.820\nIf it's right here on this storage and\nthis server were to fail, if VMHOST01\n\n50\n00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:37.450\nfails and goes offline, I can't rapidly\nmove WEB01 to one of these other servers.\n\n51\n00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.111\nBecause WEB01 exists on these hard drives,\nand these hard drives are on VMHOST01.\n\n52\n00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:45.930\nAnd there's nothing I can do about that.\n\n53\n00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.130\nI can run as fast as I\ncan to the server room,\n\n54\n00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.030\nrip the hard drives out of VMHOST01 and\ngo stick them into another server,\n\n55\n00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.710\nassuming there's room and\nassuming they're hot swappable.\n\n56\n00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.807\nBut otherwise, direct attached\nstorage is not going to allow that.\n\n57\n00:02:56.807 --> 00:02:59.759\nBy having non-shared storage like this,\n\n58\n00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:05.898\nit limits functionality like clusters and\neven load-balancing in a lot of cases.\n\n59\n00:03:05.898 --> 00:03:09.380\nCuz with load-balancing, I would have to\nhave some other mechanism on the back end\n\n60\n00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.280\nreplicating the data across the drives.\n\n61\n00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.840\nI would have to store\nfour copies of Web01,\n\n62\n00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.860\nwhich is a real waste of storage, right?\n\n63\n00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.500\nSo direct attached storage is not\nvery efficient in a data center.\n\n64\n00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.950\nAt home, in your office on your desktop or\nyour laptop,\n\n65\n00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.230\ndirect attached storage is really the only\nway to fly cuz it doesn't make sense\n\n66\n00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.620\nto have some really expensive\nstorage hardware for your desktop.\n\n67\n00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.720\nBut in a data center where\nyou have multiple servers,\n\n68\n00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.590\ndirect attached storage is not\nthe ideal solution anymore.\n\n69\n00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.090\nMost servers will just have\ndirect attached storage for\n\n70\n00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.340\ntheir operating system.\n\n71\n00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.090\nSo their operating system will\nlaunch right off of that, and\n\n72\n00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.200\nthen their data will be\nstored somewhere else.\n\n73\n00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.000\nAll right, so\nwhere is that somewhere else?\n\n74\n00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.210\nWell, this is where we get\ninto the world of NAS and SAN.\n\n75\n00:03:53.210 --> 00:04:00.290\nNAS is network attached storage and\nSAN is storage area network.\n\n76\n00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.580\nIt's the same thing backwards, right?\n\n77\n00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.748\nBut it's actually two very,\n\n78\n00:04:03.748 --> 00:04:06.231\nvery different things,\nespecially in the price point range.\n\n79\n00:04:06.231 --> 00:04:08.053\n[LAUGH] But two very different things.\n\n80\n00:04:08.053 --> 00:04:09.875\nNAS, network attached storage.\n\n81\n00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:15.729\nWhat a NAS is, is where instead of having\nthe storage directly attached to a server,\n\n82\n00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:19.780\nwe have the NAS box plugged\nright into our switch.\n\n83\n00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.730\nSo we have a switch on our network,\nand the NAS plugs right into it.\n\n84\n00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.830\nNow the NAS will have direct\nattached storage of its own, right?\n\n85\n00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.390\nSo a NAS box is really just a box,\nusually.\n\n86\n00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.840\nWestern Digital makes them, Buffalo,\nDrobo, there's all sorts of vendors out\n\n87\n00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.030\nthere, QNAP, that makes these\nnetwork attached storage devices.\n\n88\n00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.200\nAnd you pop all your\nhard drives into the NAS.\n\n89\n00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.510\nAnd then you can load something\nlike the hard drive for\n\n90\n00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.040\nWEB01, this Virtual Machine.\n\n91\n00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.130\nI can load it on those drives.\n\n92\n00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.950\nAll of my servers can see that storage,\n\n93\n00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.910\nbecause they're connected to a switch,\nand this switch is connected to the NAS.\n\n94\n00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:03.570\nAnd it's done over a traditional network,\nso a TCP/IP or IPv4 network.\n\n95\n00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.087\nNow on a positive side,\nall my servers can see the storage.\n\n96\n00:05:07.087 --> 00:05:08.596\nThat's great.\n\n97\n00:05:08.596 --> 00:05:11.851\nOn a negative side, my regular network,\n\n98\n00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:15.950\nit's gonna be slow even if\nI have a gigabit network.\n\n99\n00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.950\nSo every system has a gigabit NIC.\n\n100\n00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.680\nWell, if I'm using SATA drives,\n\n101\n00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.950\nyou get six gigabit SATA drives\non a one gigabit network.\n\n102\n00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.560\nThat math doesn't add up.\n\n103\n00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.370\nIf I have serial attached SCSI drives,\nI might even have more, right?\n\n104\n00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.560\nMy throughput is going to exceed\nwhat my network can carry;.\n\n105\n00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.420\nSo NAS boxes are not designed for\nthings like running virtual machines.\n\n106\n00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.080\nThey're designed to be file servers.\n\n107\n00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.490\nIf I have a NAS and I start putting\ndocuments on there, images,\n\n108\n00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.160\nwhatever, now my work stations\ncan connect and access it.\n\n109\n00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.230\nNAS boxes are designed to eliminate\nservers, not to support servers.\n\n110\n00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.560\nSo that's why you see NAS servers\ndeployed mostly in homes and\n\n111\n00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.100\nsmall offices where they\nact as a file server.\n\n112\n00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.770\nAnd it really is just a server with\ndirect attached storage that plugs\n\n113\n00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:02.350\ninto the network.\n\n114\n00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.470\nSo if that's not suitable for\nthings like clusters, and\n\n115\n00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.500\nvirtual machine hosting,\nand so on, what is?\n\n116\n00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.340\nWell, that's where we get\ninto a storage area network.\n\n117\n00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.940\nNetwork attached storage, NAS,\nassumes there's already a network and\n\n118\n00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.550\nwe're attaching storage to it, right,\nwe're reusing an existing network.\n\n119\n00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.640\nBut a storage area network, a SAN,\nthat assumes we have storage.\n\n120\n00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.500\nAnd we're building a network\naround the storage, right.\n\n121\n00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.460\nSo we're actually building\na network that is dedicated\n\n122\n00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.810\njust to carrying storage traffic.\n\n123\n00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.590\nAnd when we do that,\nthere's two routes we can follow.\n\n124\n00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.910\nThere's a cheap route and\nthere's an expensive route.\n\n125\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.290\nAnd you've probably already guessed it,\nthe cheap route, not terribly fast.\n\n126\n00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.550\nThe expensive route,\nblazingly fast and amazing and\n\n127\n00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.810\nit's exactly what you want if\nyou can get the budget for it.\n\n128\n00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.680\nBut it really does come down to budget.\n\n129\n00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.020\nSo on the SAN side of things,\nthe storage area network.\n\n130\n00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.740\nLet's talk about the cheap one first.\n\n131\n00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.345\nOn the cheap side,\nyou have what's called an iSCSI SAN.\n\n132\n00:07:04.345 --> 00:07:08.580\nAn iSCSI SAN is kind of like a NAS box.\n\n133\n00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.280\nIt plugs into a network and\n\n134\n00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.700\nall of your servers can plug\ninto that network also and\n\n135\n00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:19.010\nit's a traditional network so it will be\na gigabit or maybe a 10 gigabit network.\n\n136\n00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:24.740\nAnd what iSCSI does,\nis it takes regular SCSI traffic and\n\n137\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.560\nencapsulates it in TCP/IP to send\nacross our regular switches.\n\n138\n00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.610\nSo far this doesn't sound very\ndifferent than a NAS, does it?\n\n139\n00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.440\nWell, with a NAS,\n\n140\n00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.420\nwhen you see storage on the network,\nyou see it as like a shared folder.\n\n141\n00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.650\nYou know the NAS is there.\n\n142\n00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.000\nBut when you see an iSCSI\nSAN on a network,\n\n143\n00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.090\nyou actually see them as\nlocally attached hard drives.\n\n144\n00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.660\nYou see them as hard\ndrives in your system.\n\n145\n00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.689\nAnd you talk to them as if they were SCSI\ndrives that were internal to your server.\n\n146\n00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:56.376\nBut in reality they're\nstored out here in the SAN.\n\n147\n00:07:56.376 --> 00:08:01.351\nSo if I have Web01's hardrive\nlocated out here on the SAN All of\n\n148\n00:08:01.351 --> 00:08:03.112\nmy servers could see.\n\n149\n00:08:03.112 --> 00:08:07.933\nAnd if one of my servers failed, another\nserver could grab WEB01s virtual machine's\n\n150\n00:08:07.933 --> 00:08:12.125\nhard drive and boot it up, and now I'm\nup and running to get shared storage.\n\n151\n00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:15.780\nBut it is a network which I just\ngot done saying it was slow,\n\n152\n00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.740\nthis doesn't make it any faster.\n\n153\n00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.760\nAlthough, you could do\na dedicated network for it.\n\n154\n00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.590\nA dedicated traditional\nswitch with dedicated links.\n\n155\n00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.200\nMy servers might all have\ntwo network adaptors.\n\n156\n00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.262\nOne that focuses on my LAN and\nregular communications.\n\n157\n00:08:31.262 --> 00:08:34.094\nAnd another one that just\nconnects to the storage network,\n\n158\n00:08:34.094 --> 00:08:35.460\na dedicated network for it.\n\n159\n00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.390\nBut performance is not great.\n\n160\n00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.370\nIf we want great performance,\n\n161\n00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:45.810\nthat's when we need to move to what's\ncalled a fiber optic network, right?\n\n162\n00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.220\nWith a fiber optic network you set\nup what's called a switch fabric.\n\n163\n00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.498\nAnd a switch fabric is what interconnects\nall of your servers with the storage area\n\n164\n00:08:52.498 --> 00:08:53.056\nnetwork.\n\n165\n00:08:53.056 --> 00:08:56.635\nAnd when you do that, it looks very\nsimilar to what I just showed you,\n\n166\n00:08:56.635 --> 00:08:59.599\nexcept this is not a traditional\nTCPIP based switch, and\n\n167\n00:08:59.599 --> 00:09:02.020\nyou're not running IPV4 over it.\n\n168\n00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.480\nYou're running SCSI over it.\n\n169\n00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.580\nNot encapsulated,\n\n170\n00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.690\nyou're running actual SCSI being\nsent over the fiber channel network.\n\n171\n00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.900\nAnd the switch is designed to be able\nto route those SCSI commands to get\n\n172\n00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.160\nto the storage area network.\n\n173\n00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.000\nSo these are fiber optic links, and\nyour storage is available on them, and\n\n174\n00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.280\nit runs at very, very high speeds.\n\n175\n00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.418\n&gt;&gt; Don, we know fiber optics\nspeeds up everything, but\n\n176\n00:09:24.418 --> 00:09:27.459\nthe lack of the encapsulation that has\nto be done on a fiber channel network,\n\n177\n00:09:27.459 --> 00:09:30.692\nis that one of the things that helps to\nspeed up performance because it's sending\n\n178\n00:09:30.692 --> 00:09:33.827\nit and you're receiving it, and there's\nnot a lot of chopping and slicing and\n\n179\n00:09:33.827 --> 00:09:34.953\ndicing that has to happen?\n\n180\n00:09:34.953 --> 00:09:37.744\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah, you don't have\nto manipulate that data at all, so\n\n181\n00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:38.590\nit goes in real time.\n\n182\n00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:42.430\nIt kinda, like, goes back to the type\n1 versus type 2 hypervisor talk where\n\n183\n00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.420\na type 2 hypervisor's having to emulate\nstuff and then it slows it down.\n\n184\n00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.230\nISCSI is emulating, it's taking\nthat SCSI and encapsulating it,\n\n185\n00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:51.350\nthrowing it on the network.\n\n186\n00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:55.240\nHere, we don't, we just talk like we\nnormally would talk to a hard drive.\n\n187\n00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.870\n&gt;&gt; You know over the past couple\nof years in working with you,\n\n188\n00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.670\nI know that you guys have spent\nsome money on some NAS devices.\n\n189\n00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.670\nAnd I know they can range from anywhere\nfrom a couple hundred dollars to even up\n\n190\n00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.440\nto a couple thousand, really.\n\n191\n00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.520\nGive our viewers an idea,\nwhen you say throwing money at it and\n\n192\n00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.000\nyou're talking about a SAN I know you've\nseen and worked with some of these\n\n193\n00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.880\ntechnologies, how much money am I throwing\nout of my pocket at a device like this?\n\n194\n00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:21.060\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna come down to how many\nservers you have connected and\n\n195\n00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.550\nhow much storage.\n\n196\n00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.120\nA small SAN deployment,\nwhere we're talking four or\n\n197\n00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.610\nfive servers and maybe 10 or\n12 terabytes of data.\n\n198\n00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.040\nIf you're doing fiber channel,\n\n199\n00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.330\nit's usually gonna put you in\nthe 30 to $40,000 range, right?\n\n200\n00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.780\nAnd we're just talking storage,\nnot servers.\n\n201\n00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.720\nSo it gets expensive, right?\n\n202\n00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.840\nThe SAN switches, the fiber optic switches\nthat you have to use to move this stuff,\n\n203\n00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.190\nyou can get cheap ones for 2 to $3,000,\nbut they're usually 5 to $6,000 just for\n\n204\n00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.840\nthe switch, and you normally want two,\ncuz this is your storage.\n\n205\n00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.030\nIf you have a switch failure,\nyou want to be able to flip over.\n\n206\n00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.200\nIn my diagram,\nI have a redundant switch fabric, right?\n\n207\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.980\nSo I've got more,\nwhen they talk about fiber optics,\n\n208\n00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.190\nthey talk about it like silk and\nfabric and all that is weird terminology.\n\n209\n00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.700\nBut I've got a redundant switch fabric.\n\n210\n00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.880\nI've got two switches, and I've got the\norange lines and the blue lines, right?\n\n211\n00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.088\nSo every server has two\nlines connecting it?\n\n212\n00:11:11.088 --> 00:11:13.950\nI could loose a switch, or\nan interface, or whatever, and\n\n213\n00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.270\nstill be able to get to it.\n\n214\n00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.480\nAlthough, I did leave out\nsomething important here.\n\n215\n00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.830\nI didn't draw a blue line doubling\nback to my SAN like that, there.\n\n216\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.870\nThat would be redundant fabric, right?\n\n217\n00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.395\nWhat I've got here though is\na different line running out to my LAN.\n\n218\n00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:30.616\nThat's what we'd see if the blue ones\nwere, say, like, our traditional network,\n\n219\n00:11:30.616 --> 00:11:31.702\nthat's our TCPIP network.\n\n220\n00:11:31.702 --> 00:11:34.815\nAnd the orange ones,\nThat becomes our storage network.\n\n221\n00:11:34.815 --> 00:11:37.635\nThe orange to be our fiber\nthis running to a dedicate\n\n222\n00:11:37.635 --> 00:11:39.925\nSANs switch versus a traditional switch.\n\n223\n00:11:39.925 --> 00:11:43.526\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, going to those servers, that's\nnot gonna be a traditional like ethernet\n\n224\n00:11:43.526 --> 00:11:45.985\nbase network adapter,\nwhat do we find in our servers?\n\n225\n00:11:45.985 --> 00:11:50.285\n&gt;&gt; Right, so on the server side it's gonna\nsee these as locally attached hard drives.\n\n226\n00:11:50.285 --> 00:11:55.480\nAnd the way it does that is by using an\nadapter called the host bus adapter, HBA.\n\n227\n00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.630\nAnd host bus adapters,\nthey look like fiber optic network cards.\n\n228\n00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.080\nThey look just like a NIC that\nhas a fiber optic port on it.\n\n229\n00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.042\nSo it's not really any different.\n\n230\n00:12:02.042 --> 00:12:05.016\nIn fact, if you go on and buy a fiber\noptic NIC they'll look really the same,\n\n231\n00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:07.100\nexcept the chips on them are different.\n\n232\n00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.020\nBecause a network card looks like\na network card to our operating system.\n\n233\n00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.800\nBut a host bus adapter looks\nlike a hard drive controller.\n\n234\n00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.860\nIt thinks that it's talking to a locally\nattached hard drive controller and\n\n235\n00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.000\nit's looking at a SCSI bus.\n\n236\n00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.016\nAnd he's saying what's\nSCUZI drives are out there.\n\n237\n00:12:22.016 --> 00:12:26.110\nWell SCUZI drives are identified\nwith logical unit numbers or LUNS.\n\n238\n00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.570\nAnd so it's expecting actual\nhard drives to respond back and\n\n239\n00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.850\nsay, I'm LUN number 3, I'm here.\n\n240\n00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.200\nI'm LUN 5, I'm here.\n\n241\n00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.725\nI'm LUN 1, you got me, right?\n\n242\n00:12:34.725 --> 00:12:36.840\nAnd so it sees the three drives and\noff it goes.\n\n243\n00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.010\nWell the host bus adaptor\ntakes those queries and\n\n244\n00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.520\nthrows them across the switch fabric.\n\n245\n00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.440\nAnd it makes it over to the SAN, and\n\n246\n00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.580\nthe SAN has logical containers,\nslices of all the drives.\n\n247\n00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.720\nIt might have 200 hard drives in it.\n\n248\n00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.653\nAnd it will have five drives sliced\nout as a five array or array zero or\n\n249\n00:12:54.653 --> 00:12:56.793\nwhatever to hand off to this server.\n\n250\n00:12:56.793 --> 00:13:01.060\nAnd it gives it a fake LUN,\nit generates its own LUN number.\n\n251\n00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.570\nAnd it sends a message back and\nsays, yep, I'm LUN 1, here I am.\n\n252\n00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.890\nAnd the server thinks\nit's an internal drive.\n\n253\n00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:07.550\nSo host boss adapters\n\n254\n00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:12.200\nare specifically designed to look\nlike hard drive controllers.\n\n255\n00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.000\nAnd on the SAN, it's gonna be managing\nLANs for all the different servers.\n\n256\n00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.350\nAnd so\nyou do something called LAN masking.\n\n257\n00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:24.990\nLAN masking is where you say\nVMHOST01,can see these three LUNs,\n\n258\n00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.740\nthese three virtual drives.\n\n259\n00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.490\nVM host 02,\ncan see these other three drives.\n\n260\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.410\nAnd VM host 03 can see yet\nagain other ones, right.\n\n261\n00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.360\nWe don't want them to be able\nto see each other's drives.\n\n262\n00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.630\nIn real life lane, if I had a physical\ndrive, and I hook two systems up to it,\n\n263\n00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.250\nI would get almost\ninstantaneous data corruption.\n\n264\n00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.399\nYou can't have two systems write to\nthe same drive at the same time.\n\n265\n00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.210\nYou can have two systems read from\nthe same drive, but not write.\n\n266\n00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.080\nThe moment they try and write together,\nit's gonna be corrupted.\n\n267\n00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.488\nSo, when we have logical\ndisks on a shared network,\n\n268\n00:13:55.488 --> 00:13:57.200\nwe have to maintain that integrity.\n\n269\n00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.770\nAnd LUN masking is the easy way\nto do that, you isolate them out.\n\n270\n00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.819\nBut there is a scenario\nwhere we don't want that.\n\n271\n00:14:02.819 --> 00:14:05.764\nFor example,\nif I want these to be a cluster,\n\n272\n00:14:05.764 --> 00:14:09.750\nif I'm clustering all of\nthese virtual machine hosts.\n\n273\n00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:13.853\nBecause I want it so that Web 01,\nthis virtual machine,\n\n274\n00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:18.312\ncan bounce from server to server\nto server based on resources.\n\n275\n00:14:18.312 --> 00:14:20.426\nOr if one fails, I want it to be\nable to bounce to the other one,\n\n276\n00:14:20.426 --> 00:14:22.330\nI want it to happen instantaneously.\n\n277\n00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:27.200\nThey all need to see the storage\nthat's holding that VM.\n\n278\n00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.950\nAnd they can all see it,\nas long as they're only reading.\n\n279\n00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.950\nAnd only one of them is allowed to write.\n\n280\n00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:37.290\nAnd if the one that's writing fails,\nsomebody else can take over that role.\n\n281\n00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.200\nAnd that's really what\na cluster is all about.\n\n282\n00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.239\nCluster software ss really just\ndictating access to the storage.\n\n283\n00:14:43.239 --> 00:14:43.867\nIt's saying,\n\n284\n00:14:43.867 --> 00:14:47.166\nall right, there's five servers, only\nserver number two is allowed to write.\n\n285\n00:14:47.166 --> 00:14:50.320\nWhoops, server two is gone,\nnow server three is allowed to write.\n\n286\n00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.195\nThat's the secret sauce behind a cluster.\n\n287\n00:14:52.195 --> 00:14:54.949\nThere's shared storage, and\ncontrolled write access, so\n\n288\n00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:56.247\nit's a key principle of it.\n\n289\n00:14:56.247 --> 00:15:00.237\n&gt;&gt; In your fiber channel technology there\nDon, when you're using clustering like\n\n290\n00:15:00.237 --> 00:15:03.993\nthat, does it use some of the traditional\nclustering techniques, like for\n\n291\n00:15:03.993 --> 00:15:08.170\ninstance Heart Beat, to keep aware of\nwhat's going on across the network?\n\n292\n00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.140\n&gt;&gt; Not the storage.\n\n293\n00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.960\nThat's up to the cluster to do that.\n\n294\n00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.040\nThe storage is just storage.\n\n295\n00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:13.940\nIt just does it's job.\n\n296\n00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.694\nIt says I have hard drives,\nI will present them to you.\n\n297\n00:15:15.694 --> 00:15:18.820\nIf you want to screw up and let two people\nwrite to the same one you can do it,\n\n298\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.710\ngood luck, right?\n\n299\n00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.270\nSo it's up to your operating systems.\n\n300\n00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:25.629\nIf I'm running Windows and I'm running\nthe Microsoft Windows failover cluster\n\n301\n00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:28.587\nservice, it dictates who\ngets access to those disks.\n\n302\n00:15:28.587 --> 00:15:33.010\nThe SAN would be saying, everybody's\nallowed to write, have at it, right?\n\n303\n00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:37.500\nSo let the storage unit focus on storage,\nlet the cluster focus on clustering.\n\n304\n00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.750\nThat's the approach,\nbecause you may not be running Windows.\n\n305\n00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:42.730\nMaybe you've got a Linux Beowulf cluster.\n\n306\n00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.538\nAnd so now you've got a different\nsystem that's managing that.\n\n307\n00:15:44.538 --> 00:15:47.826\nMaybe you have multiple paths,\nand so you're leveraging MPIO,\n\n308\n00:15:47.826 --> 00:15:49.260\nMulti Path Input Output, so\n\n309\n00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.109\nthat you can load balance across the two\ndifferent switch fabrics, right?\n\n310\n00:15:53.109 --> 00:15:55.927\nNow the storage unit definitely doesn't\nknow what the heck's going on, so\n\n311\n00:15:55.927 --> 00:15:57.963\nyou gotta have a way to communicate and\ntalk with that.\n\n312\n00:15:57.963 --> 00:16:00.406\nThe storage unit doesn't\nget too involved in that.\n\n313\n00:16:00.406 --> 00:16:01.957\nIt's just presenting drives.\n\n314\n00:16:01.957 --> 00:16:05.190\nWith LUN masking, we can restrict\nthat drive presentation, but\n\n315\n00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.890\notherwise it's just doing it.\n\n316\n00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.970\nSo, that kind of the key principle\nbehind a Fibre Channel SAN.\n\n317\n00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:14.442\nIt's expensive, but if you go and\nbuy a Fibre Channel SAN right now,\n\n318\n00:16:14.442 --> 00:16:17.307\nI've kinda standardized on 16 gigabit.\n\n319\n00:16:17.307 --> 00:16:20.290\nSo we have one gigabit and\n10 gigabit network.\n\n320\n00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.045\nSometimes 40 gigabit networks.\n\n321\n00:16:22.045 --> 00:16:26.530\nSANs, they're 16 gigabit\nright out of the box.\n\n322\n00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.752\nAnd if you've got SAS drives or\nwhatever that are six gigabit drives,\n\n323\n00:16:29.752 --> 00:16:32.228\nthey've got plenty of room\nto be able to handle that.\n\n324\n00:16:32.228 --> 00:16:35.480\nAnd with Fibre, you can be sending on\nmore than one frequency at the same time,\n\n325\n00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.080\nwhich can give you\nsimultaneous drive access, and\n\n326\n00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.820\nthat really creates a level of\nperformance that's pretty amazing.\n\n327\n00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.320\nSo, this is the solution that you're gonna\nsee in larger data centers where you have\n\n328\n00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.500\nclustered systems that\nneed shared storage.\n\n329\n00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.912\nNow, going all the way back to direct\nattached storage, when you plug disks in,\n\n330\n00:16:52.912 --> 00:16:57.305\nwe might build arrays on them, and so\nyou have RAID on Fibre Channel SANs and\n\n331\n00:16:57.305 --> 00:17:01.242\nshared storage like NAS and SAN,\nyou'll build arrays there too.\n\n332\n00:17:01.242 --> 00:17:02.512\nYou don't have to though.\n\n333\n00:17:02.512 --> 00:17:04.880\nYou can leave them as independent disks,\nright?\n\n334\n00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.040\nAnd they call that JBOD,\nor just a bunch of disks.\n\n335\n00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.410\nWhen you present the disks to a system,\n\n336\n00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:15.280\nif we've applied a RAID array to\nit then you see the container.\n\n337\n00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.920\nYou see the single drive.\n\n338\n00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.660\nIt might be five drives under the hood,\nbut you only see one.\n\n339\n00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.500\nWith JBOD, you see each individual disk.\n\n340\n00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.770\nAnd that frees it up so the operating\nsystem can use the drives individually or\n\n341\n00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.500\nthey can build a software\nRAID across them if need be.\n\n342\n00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:33.360\nBut JBOD, that's not typically used on\nservers, cuz we want redundancy and\n\n343\n00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.600\nJBOD doesn't do it.\n\n344\n00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.930\nAnd we're not gonna use software\nRAID if we can avoid it.\n\n345\n00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.800\nBut on workstations and stuff,\nyou're technically dealing with JBOD.\n\n346\n00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.700\nEach disk is an independent disk\nthat functions without the others.\n\n347\n00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.970\nNow, as far as storage is concerned,\n\n348\n00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:49.650\nthese are the primary storage types that\nwe're gonna be seeing in a data center.\n\n349\n00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:52.720\nBut there are a few other kind of\none offs that I wanna mention.\n\n350\n00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.640\nI don't have pretty diagrams for\nbut that we should think about.\n\n351\n00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.819\nAnd that is for example,\nI had a pretty picture for one masking,\n\n352\n00:17:59.819 --> 00:18:02.579\nI didn't even use it,\nbut any how [LAUGH], so\n\n353\n00:18:02.579 --> 00:18:06.750\nhere I've got my different drives and\nthey kind of colored.\n\n354\n00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:11.015\nSo on the SAN, we can say like,\nWEB01 is allowed to see this green drive.\n\n355\n00:18:11.015 --> 00:18:12.585\nOr WEB02, you can see the purple drive.\n\n356\n00:18:12.585 --> 00:18:14.835\nDatabase 01,\nyou can see two of these red drives.\n\n357\n00:18:14.835 --> 00:18:16.065\nAnd they're all isolated out.\n\n358\n00:18:16.065 --> 00:18:19.345\nThat's what LUN masking is all about.\n\n359\n00:18:19.345 --> 00:18:22.735\nBut those are some of the things that\nwe're gonna see in a data center.\n\n360\n00:18:22.735 --> 00:18:26.430\nOther types of one off storage will\nbe things like if I have tape backup.\n\n361\n00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:30.200\nIf I have tape backup, I might have\na dedicated network just for the tape or\n\n362\n00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.020\nthe tape drives might be\ndirectly attached to the servers.\n\n363\n00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.910\nThat's a little more common cuz\nit's cheaper to do it that way.\n\n364\n00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:40.870\nWhen you have tapes, they plug in\nusually to a SATA port on the server,\n\n365\n00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:41.910\neven if your server is all SCSI though,\n\n366\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.920\nusually there'll be at least one SATA\nport for a CD drive, or the tape backup.\n\n367\n00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.890\nSometimes they'll even have traditional\nolder SCSI ports on there for\n\n368\n00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.190\nthe tape backup, you can backup to it.\n\n369\n00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:54.370\nTape backup doesn't need a huge amount of\nspeed, cuz you can write over hours and\n\n370\n00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.900\nhours and hours, and it just doesn't\nimpact the performance of your server.\n\n371\n00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.110\nBut it is available, it's there.\n\n372\n00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:02.114\nYou can access that data if you need it.\n\n373\n00:19:02.114 --> 00:19:06.206\nMost people moved away from tape though\ncuz it's faster to back up to SAN or\n\n374\n00:19:06.206 --> 00:19:07.800\nnetwork storage like that.\n\n375\n00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.260\nWe also have optical drives,\n\n376\n00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.320\nI mentioned CD drives,\na lot of servers still have a CD drive so\n\n377\n00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.730\nyou can install your operating system\non them or run diagnostic utilities.\n\n378\n00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:19.550\nBut even that's going away, and\na lot of the newer servers just have USB.\n\n379\n00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:23.740\nThat we can have flash drives and thumb\ndrives that we pop in to boot the system\n\n380\n00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:27.970\noff of, maybe to install the OS or\nrun maintenance.\n\n381\n00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.310\nMaybe you boot the OS\noff a flash drive and\n\n382\n00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:31.890\nthen all the data is accessed on the SAN.\n\n383\n00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:35.000\nSo you don't have any moving hard\ndrives in the system at all.\n\n384\n00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.210\nThose are all different solution,\n\n385\n00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.306\ndifferent types of storage\nyou might find in a server.\n\n386\n00:19:38.306 --> 00:19:40.970\nBut predominately,\nyou're gonna be dealing with\n\n387\n00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:45.950\ndirect attached storage of hard drives,\nor SAN, storage area network.\n\n388\n00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:46.620\nNAS?\n\n389\n00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.120\nThat's more of a replacement for a server.\n\n390\n00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.123\nThat's more of small environment.\n\n391\n00:19:50.123 --> 00:19:54.250\nIn a large environment, it's gonna\nbe all direct attached storage and\n\n392\n00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.711\nstorage area networks.\n\n393\n00:19:55.711 --> 00:19:58.620\nAll right, I think that's about all\nI've got on storage technologies.\n\n394\n00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.840\nWes, can you think of\nanything I've forgot?\n\n395\n00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.405\n&gt;&gt; No,\nI think you've hit everyone of them.\n\n396\n00:20:01.405 --> 00:20:03.020\nLooking by at our objectives.\n\n397\n00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.540\nI've been marking them off\nas you've been going on.\n\n398\n00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.130\n&gt;&gt; There is one I didn't really\nmention though which is FCoE.\n\n399\n00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:10.810\nFCoE is Fibre Channel over Ethernet.\n\n400\n00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:12.755\nWe were talking about Fibre Channel SANs,\nright?\n\n401\n00:20:12.755 --> 00:20:14.221\nAnd Fibre Channel SANs are grey.\n\n402\n00:20:14.221 --> 00:20:15.685\nLet me go back to my diagram.\n\n403\n00:20:15.685 --> 00:20:19.449\nFibre Channel SANs are grey, if all\nthe servers are in the same building and\n\n404\n00:20:19.449 --> 00:20:23.250\nI can just run the fiber right to the\nfiber switch and plug in the SAN to that.\n\n405\n00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:25.150\nAnd now everybody gets access.\n\n406\n00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.929\nBut what if I wanna go to\na model with redundant SANs?\n\n407\n00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.310\nIf I wanted redundant SANs and they're in\nthe same building, that's not a big deal.\n\n408\n00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:36.620\nBut what if they're in\ncompletely different locations?\n\n409\n00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:40.690\nWhat if I had a headquarters, right\nhere in Gainesville with San Juan, and\n\n410\n00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:44.390\nthen I want a failover to Atlanta,\nso I have another SAN up there?\n\n411\n00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:48.120\nHow do I replicate data between the two,\nthese are Fibre Channel SANs.\n\n412\n00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.920\nI can't pay for fiber to run from\nhere all the way to Atlanta.\n\n413\n00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.820\nEven if I could pay for,\nI don't know that I can get it cleared\n\n414\n00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.580\npermit wise to run a cable\nfrom here to Atlanta.\n\n415\n00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:04.140\nSo instead, I can take Fibre Channel and\nencapsulate it and\n\n416\n00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:08.640\nthrow it over Ethernet, and send it across\na VPN tunnel or the Internet or whatever.\n\n417\n00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:12.546\nNow, when I mentioned iSCSI, Wes made\nthe comment that hey, iSCSI encapsulates,\n\n418\n00:21:12.546 --> 00:21:15.421\nthat slows it down, right,\nFibre Channel doesn't do that.\n\n419\n00:21:15.421 --> 00:21:19.310\nHere I'm encapsulating Fibre Channel,\nso it kills performance,\n\n420\n00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:22.960\nit's not suitable for\nrunning as far as production use.\n\n421\n00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.250\nBut for backups and\nreplication, it works out well.\n\n422\n00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.970\nSo you'll see FCoE,\nFibre Channel Over Ethernet,\n\n423\n00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:32.400\nwhere we take our Fibre Channel\ncommunications here and we send them over\n\n424\n00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.790\nan Ethernet network to be able to dump\noff onto another SAN somewhere else.\n\n425\n00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.250\nIf the SANs are in the same building,\n\n426\n00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.620\nyou actually get pretty\ndecent performance out of it.\n\n427\n00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.840\nBut if they're in different geographical\nlocations, it's gonna be slow.\n\n428\n00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.140\nAnd that's why it's only used for\nreplication and failover.\n\n429\n00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.130\nSo just another technology with neat\nobjectives I didn't really mention.\n\n430\n00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:53.662\nThey count that as network-attached\nstorage, because you're using an existing\n\n431\n00:21:53.662 --> 00:21:56.040\nnetwork and\nyou're pushing your storage data over it.\n\n432\n00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.900\nSo a little different than\nwhat we consider a normal SAN.\n\n433\n00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.600\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say I thought we had\na lot of options when it comes to server\n\n434\n00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.140\nenvironments.\n\n435\n00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:07.060\nBut it looks like, for performance wise,\nwe really only have a couple there.\n\n436\n00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.090\nDon, it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n437\n00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.900\nBut before we do,\ndo you have any parting words?\n\n438\n00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.520\nAnd maybe you'd like to let our\nviewers know when it comes to\n\n439\n00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.980\ndifferent storage technologies\nin our server environments.\n\n440\n00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.850\n&gt;&gt; Don't be daunted by the price of a SAN.\n\n441\n00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.320\nThey're expensive, but\nthey're a necessity.\n\n442\n00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.240\nAnd so it needs to be worked into your\nIT budget and part of that process.\n\n443\n00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.980\nWhen you have large amounts of storage,\nif you're juggling around iSCSI devices,\n\n444\n00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.650\nthe performance is terrible.\n\n445\n00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.565\nYour servers are gonna be running\nway better if you just made\n\n446\n00:22:31.565 --> 00:22:32.690\nthe investment in it.\n\n447\n00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:34.660\nThe nice part about SANs\nis that they're expandable.\n\n448\n00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.500\nThey can grow with your company.\n\n449\n00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.370\nSo once you get them deployed,\n\n450\n00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.760\nit's not like you're having to\nreplace it every two years.\n\n451\n00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.130\nYou'll usually be able to run the SAN for\na good five years, and\n\n452\n00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:46.580\njust continually add storage to it,\nbefore it needs replacing.\n\n453\n00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.480\nIt's an investment that's worthwhile.\n\n454\n00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.940\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, great information,\n\n455\n00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.210\nwe appreciate you being here\nin the studios with

00:00:07.121\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:08.220\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.893\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.893 --> 00:00:14.890\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.160\nThank you for joining us.\n\n8\n00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.020\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\n\n9\n00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.860\nand in today's episode we're continuing\nthrough our series in CompTIA Server+.\n\n10\n00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.810\nJoining us back in the studios again\nis none other that Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.860\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.680\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n13\n00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.587\nReady to dive right back into Server+.\n\n14\n00:00:28.587 --> 00:00:30.592\nAnd as we've been doing\nthe last couple of episodes,\n\n15\n00:00:30.592 --> 00:00:32.660\nwe're gonna be focusing on storage.\n\n16\n00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.590\nBut in this episode, we are going to take\na step back from some of the hardware for\n\n17\n00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.350\na moment and\n\n18\n00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.790\ntake look at a little more of the software\nside of storage on our servers.\n\n19\n00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.400\nAnd just kinda look at a few things\nthat we need to be aware of that\n\n20\n00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.270\nare going on in the background and\nthings that you'll see pretty frequently.\n\n21\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.920\nWhat I wanna start with is one of the\ngreat big storage mysteries of the ages,\n\n22\n00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.950\nwhich is, you go to the store or online or\nwherever and you buy a hard drive.\n\n23\n00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.390\nAnd it's a terabyte hard drive.\n\n24\n00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.880\nAnd you plug it into your server and\nyou fire it up.\n\n25\n00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.260\nAnd you go to access it.\n\n26\n00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.000\nAnd all of a sudden, that terabyte hard\ndrive becomes a 940 gig hard drive.\n\n27\n00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.780\nAnd you're wondering,\nlike where'd my 60 gigabytes of data go?\n\n28\n00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.280\nI remember my first computer\nthat had a hard drive.\n\n29\n00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.800\nMy first computer didn't have hard drives,\nbut\n\n30\n00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.590\nmy first one that did had\na 40 megabyte hard drive.\n\n31\n00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.090\nAnd 40 megabyte, that sounded like a lot.\n\n32\n00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.110\nI mean, that was, I don't know, 20 to 25\nfloppy disks all stored on one hard drive.\n\n33\n00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.370\nThat was awesome.\n\n34\n00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.300\nAnd the thought of wasting 60 gigabytes\n\n35\n00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.590\nof data would have just\nblown my mind back then.\n\n36\n00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.970\nAnd even having one gigabyte of\ndata would have blown my mind,\n\n37\n00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.920\nwhen 40 megabytes was all that I had.\n\n38\n00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.630\nBut here we are today and\nwe lose storage like that all the time.\n\n39\n00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.530\nWell, what the heck is happening, right?\n\n40\n00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.900\nWhere is that storage going?\n\n41\n00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.480\nWhy is it that I throw these large\nhard drives into my servers,\n\n42\n00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.370\nI pay extra money for them, and they\nshow up smaller than they actually are?\n\n43\n00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.740\nAnd the reality is they're not any\nsmaller than they actually are.\n\n44\n00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.810\nThere's two different ways to\nmeasure the size of a hard drive,\n\n45\n00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.690\nto measure the amount of\ndata that a drive can store.\n\n46\n00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.330\nAnd unfortunately, the hard drive\nmanufacturers do it one way and\n\n47\n00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.540\neveryone else does it a different way.\n\n48\n00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.590\nNow I know what you're thinking.\n\n49\n00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.660\nThose sleazy hard drive manufacturers\nmeasuring things the wrong way,\n\n50\n00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.130\nso it makes drives look bigger,\nhow dare they?\n\n51\n00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.355\nBut the reality is hard drive\nmanufacturers actually measure it\n\n52\n00:02:32.355 --> 00:02:35.795\nthe right way, and everywhere\nelse we measure it the wrong way.\n\n53\n00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:37.765\nNow let me explain what I'm talking about.\n\n54\n00:02:37.765 --> 00:02:41.248\nAnd I'm gonna have to throw some numbers\nup here, do a little bit of early morning\n\n55\n00:02:41.248 --> 00:02:45.425\nmath, which is always tough, but it's\nimportant to understand the concept here.\n\n56\n00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:50.388\nWhat's going on is that as human beings\nwe normally count things using what's\n\n57\n00:02:50.388 --> 00:02:52.945\ncalled Base10 mathematics, right,\n\n58\n00:02:52.945 --> 00:02:57.547\nwhere each digit represents ten\npotential values, zero through nine.\n\n59\n00:02:57.547 --> 00:03:00.483\nSo when we think about a one-digit number,\nit's zero through nine,\n\n60\n00:03:00.483 --> 00:03:01.670\nthere's ten values.\n\n61\n00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.045\nIf I have a two-digit number,\nit's 00 all the way through 99.\n\n62\n00:03:06.045 --> 00:03:10.110\nThere's 100 different values, and\neach digit is increasing that.\n\n63\n00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.877\nSo you go from tens to hundreds to\nthousands, ten thousands and so on.\n\n64\n00:03:14.877 --> 00:03:19.935\nWell, in computers,\nwe're normally thinking Base2 mathematics.\n\n65\n00:03:19.935 --> 00:03:24.480\nBase2 mathematics uses binary bits,\nzeros and ones and that's it.\n\n66\n00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.230\nThere is no two, or three,\nor four, just zero or one.\n\n67\n00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.520\nSo when we write numbers they\nhave to be represented in binary.\n\n68\n00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.157\nAnd in binary you're effectively\ndoubling the number each time so\n\n69\n00:03:36.157 --> 00:03:40.870\nyou have a one place holder and\nthen a two and then a four and an eight,\n\n70\n00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.056\na 16, 32, 64 and so on.\n\n71\n00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.760\nIt starts going up like that,\ndoubling each time.\n\n72\n00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.902\nAnd when we go to measure something, you\ncan't measure something in an even 1,000.\n\n73\n00:03:50.902 --> 00:03:54.740\nInstead that 1,000 becomes 1,024.\n\n74\n00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.870\nSo when we go to measure a hard drive,\n\n75\n00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.110\nif we're measuring a hard drive using\nBase10 mathematics, things are a little\n\n76\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.040\nbit different than when we measure\nthem using Base2 mathematics.\n\n77\n00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.010\nAnd that's really the root\nof our problem here.\n\n78\n00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.630\nSo let me just kind of\nillustrate here on my notepad.\n\n79\n00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.980\nI'll kinda write some stuff out.\n\n80\n00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.520\nWhen we talk about Base10 mathematics,\nright?\n\n81\n00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.020\nFollowing that kind of Base10 world,\nif I said I had a gigabyte drive, right?\n\n82\n00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:29.710\nOne gigabyte, then that would\nequal 1,000 megabytes, right?\n\n83\n00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.970\nSo one gigabyte equals 1,000 megabytes.\n\n84\n00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.940\nIf I were to do this in Base2\nmathematics though, that one gigabyte\n\n85\n00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.730\nwould equal 1024 megabyte, or\nmegavites, we're going crazy here.\n\n86\n00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.120\nMegabytes, all right?\n\n87\n00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.400\nSo there's my difference, right?\n\n88\n00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.817\nWhen I go into Base2, a gigabyte\nactually consumes more space than when\n\n89\n00:04:52.817 --> 00:04:59.830\nI'm in Base10, when a gigabyte consumes\neffectively 24 megabytes less, all right.\n\n90\n00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.120\nSo the hard drives that we buy,\n\n91\n00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.270\nwhen we look at the measurement on them,\nthey may look like one size, and\n\n92\n00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.210\nthen when the operating system gets a hold\nof it, they look a little bit smaller.\n\n93\n00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.020\nNow let's double back to my statement of\n\n94\n00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.650\nhow hard drive manufacturers\nare doing this the right way.\n\n95\n00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.081\nWhen you talk about one gigabyte\nequaling 1,024 megabytes, well,\n\n96\n00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:22.443\nI just wrote GB to abbreviate, right?\n\n97\n00:05:22.443 --> 00:05:23.740\nBut let's write that out.\n\n98\n00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.282\nWhen I say gigabyte, we're normally\ntalking about this right here, right?\n\n99\n00:05:27.282 --> 00:05:34.250\nG-I-G-A-B-Y-T-E, a gigabyte, right?\n\n100\n00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.380\nBut if you really wanna get technical\nabout this and dive in, when we're\n\n101\n00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.140\ntalking about the Base2 measurement and\nwe're talking about a gigabyte,\n\n102\n00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.500\nit's actually not a gigabyte,\nit's a gigibyte, right.\n\n103\n00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.738\n1 gigibyte is 1024 megabytes, right, but\n\n104\n00:05:51.738 --> 00:05:56.730\none gigabyte is 1000 megabytes, right?\n\n105\n00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.559\nAnd actually that should probably\nmegabytes too, but either way.\n\n106\n00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:05.240\nSo that unit of measure we\nuniversally say gigabyte.\n\n107\n00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.860\nI always say gigabyte, megabyte, kilobyte.\n\n108\n00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.020\nThat's what we say.\n\n109\n00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.210\nBut in reality,\nthere's a gigabyte and a gigibyte.\n\n110\n00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.220\nAnd in this scenario,\nthe hardware manufacturers,\n\n111\n00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.560\nthe hard drive guys,\nthey're doing it right.\n\n112\n00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.940\nThey're doing it the right way.\n\n113\n00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.830\nIt's on the operating system side that\nwe're doing it wrong because Base2\n\n114\n00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.050\nmathematics is so pervasive\nthroughout our operating systems.\n\n115\n00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.060\n&gt;&gt; So Don,\nit was the IEC that started this gigi with\n\n116\n00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.560\nthe I in those measurements.\n\n117\n00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.750\nAnd it's been around,\napparently, since 1998.\n\n118\n00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.989\nWhy haven't many people tried\nto jump on that bandwagon and\n\n119\n00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:40.152\nbringing us into Base2 more like,\nwell, our computer technologies are?\n\n120\n00:06:40.152 --> 00:06:41.785\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why do we still use the standard\n\n121\n00:06:41.785 --> 00:06:44.360\nimperial measurement system\nin the United States, right?\n\n122\n00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.860\nPeople like their feet and inches and they\ndon't wanna go to centimeters and meters.\n\n123\n00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.060\nIt's just that's kind of how it is.\n\n124\n00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.850\nPeople don't like change\nis what it boils down to.\n\n125\n00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.780\nAnd the reality is as long\nas storage prices are cheap,\n\n126\n00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.280\npeople don't care enough to change, right?\n\n127\n00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.070\nThere's not really a motivating reason.\n\n128\n00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.950\nHey, I just got a terabyte hard drive.\n\n129\n00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.710\nAnd it shows up as 940 gigs.\n\n130\n00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.557\nI lost 60 gigs.\n\n131\n00:07:06.557 --> 00:07:11.280\nBut the terabyte drive is only $100,\nor even on a $1,500 PM SCSI one,\n\n132\n00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.054\nall right so it was $300.\n\n133\n00:07:13.054 --> 00:07:18.310\nBut I only lost a small portion of it,\nand I didn't really lose it, it's there.\n\n134\n00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.470\nThat storage is there,\nI didn't lose anything.\n\n135\n00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.550\nIt's just being measured differently.\n\n136\n00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.110\nSo again, there's not enough of a reason\nfor people to care to change it, so\n\n137\n00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.700\nthat's why we have this difference.\n\n138\n00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.610\nBut don't be surprised when\nyou go to work with this.\n\n139\n00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.870\nNow where it gets really super mega\nconfusing or megi confusing, if we wanna\n\n140\n00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.960\ngo a little crazy with this one, is when\nyou're dealing with virtual machines.\n\n141\n00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.000\nBecause when you create a virtual hard\ndrive, you're doing it in software.\n\n142\n00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.574\nAnd so you create a virtual hard\ndrive that's 500 gigs in size, and\n\n143\n00:07:45.574 --> 00:07:47.633\nthen you fire up your virtual machine and\n\n144\n00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:51.529\nit sees an exactly 500 gig hard drive\nbecause it was all done in software.\n\n145\n00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:54.077\nI make that mistake all the time\ncuz I'll say, all right,\n\n146\n00:07:54.077 --> 00:07:56.995\nI'm gonna make a 500 gig drive and\nI actually need 500 gigs.\n\n147\n00:07:56.995 --> 00:07:59.880\nSo let me make it 512 gigs.\n\n148\n00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.264\nAnd stick a little extra padding on the\nend there to get it bumped up to be able\n\n149\n00:08:03.264 --> 00:08:06.170\nto cover what I'm gonna\nlose in the conversion.\n\n150\n00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.640\nAnd then I fire it up, and\nI've got a 512-Gig drive.\n\n151\n00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.750\nOr sometimes, you see the reverse.\n\n152\n00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.740\nWhere I'm putting it in, and\nit assumes that I'm doing it in gigabytes.\n\n153\n00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.759\nAnd converts it to giga,\nor the other way around.\n\n154\n00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:19.648\nAnd you end up with a drive\nthat's bigger than you intended.\n\n155\n00:08:19.648 --> 00:08:22.190\nAll sorts of mysterious\nthings can happen there.\n\n156\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.650\nSo just be aware there are two different\nunits of measure that come into play.\n\n157\n00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.090\nAnd that's where we see that difference.\n\n158\n00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.820\n&gt;&gt; Don, have you ever seen these\nmeasurements cause problems like in\n\n159\n00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:30.800\ndatabases?\n\n160\n00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.025\nOr we've talked in other episodes,\nlike block size for your striping and\n\n161\n00:08:34.025 --> 00:08:37.615\nstuff, the mismatch between the hardware\nand what the operating system's seen.\n\n162\n00:08:37.615 --> 00:08:40.405\nHave you ever seen that this\nhas maybe caused a problem?\n\n163\n00:08:40.405 --> 00:08:45.295\n&gt;&gt; The only place where it's really caused\nme a problem is, I think, two examples.\n\n164\n00:08:45.295 --> 00:08:47.090\nOne is cloning servers, right?\n\n165\n00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:50.136\nWhen you clone a server,\nit expects you to be able to,\n\n166\n00:08:50.136 --> 00:08:54.474\nif you're using something like\nAcronis True Image, or Symantec Ghost, or\n\n167\n00:08:54.474 --> 00:08:59.180\nwhatever, that takes a bit-for-bit copy\nof a system, even DD in Unix, right?\n\n168\n00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.050\nI'm cloning a hard drive.\n\n169\n00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.610\nI might have two 1-terabyte drives\nsitting right next to each other.\n\n170\n00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.620\nAnd I clone a single terabyte drive.\n\n171\n00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.572\nAnd then I go to apply the image\nto another terabyte drive.\n\n172\n00:09:08.572 --> 00:09:09.789\nAnd it tells me the drive\nisn't big enough.\n\n173\n00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.770\nAnd it turns out that they were off\njust a little bit because of the units\n\n174\n00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:14.310\nof measure.\n\n175\n00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.370\nAnd now it doesn't apply,\nso I've run into that.\n\n176\n00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.320\nI've also run into it where\nyou have a RAID array,\n\n177\n00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.816\nand I've got 15 1-terabyte drives.\n\n178\n00:09:21.816 --> 00:09:25.027\n1 drive goes bad, and\nI can't get that exact same drive.\n\n179\n00:09:25.027 --> 00:09:28.136\nAnd so I grab a drive from another\nmanufacturer, I pop it in there, and\n\n180\n00:09:28.136 --> 00:09:29.850\nit's off, storage-wise, right?\n\n181\n00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:30.719\nIt's not an exact match.\n\n182\n00:09:30.719 --> 00:09:33.420\nIt doesn't have the exact same\nnumber of clusters or something.\n\n183\n00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.010\nAnd now it doesn't work.\n\n184\n00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.270\nSometimes, the hard drive manufacturers\nwill put a number on there for\n\n185\n00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.260\nthe storage that's lower\nthan what you actually get.\n\n186\n00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.500\nSo they guarantee you get a little more.\n\n187\n00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.523\nAnd so you might think you have\na bunch of terabyte drives.\n\n188\n00:09:44.523 --> 00:09:48.490\nWhen you actually have a bunch of\n1.02-terabyte drives or whatever.\n\n189\n00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:50.620\nAnd that's where things\nreally start to get messy.\n\n190\n00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.500\nSo be aware that it does kinda\nchange these things are sized.\n\n191\n00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.780\nAnd will make the drive show up\ndifferently inside of your servers.\n\n192\n00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.811\nIt's something that\nhappens pretty frequently.\n\n193\n00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:03.412\nSSDs are kinda correcting\nthat a little bit, and\n\n194\n00:10:03.412 --> 00:10:05.580\nyou'll see a bunch of weird SSDs sizes.\n\n195\n00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.453\nWith hard drives, it was always these\ncertain numbers they were hit, right?\n\n196\n00:10:08.453 --> 00:10:11.620\nSo there were 500-Gig drives and\nterabyte drives.\n\n197\n00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.365\nThere are 2-terabyte and 4-terabyte.\n\n198\n00:10:14.365 --> 00:10:19.730\nYou saw 1.5, but\nyou didn't see a lot of 2.5 or 3.5s.\n\n199\n00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:23.470\nEven back in the sub-terabyte days,\nthe sub-gigabyte days,\n\n200\n00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.764\nyou'd see like an 850-Meg drive.\n\n201\n00:10:25.764 --> 00:10:29.710\nAnd then they skipped all\nthe way up to a gigabyte.\n\n202\n00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.360\nThere's certain ranges\nthat work out better for\n\n203\n00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.910\nthe way they manufacture hard drives.\n\n204\n00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.820\nThey normally kinda skip\nthese little intervals.\n\n205\n00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.780\nWith SSDs, they don't have to do that.\n\n206\n00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:43.583\nAnd so you're seeing 200-Gig SSDs and\n256-Gig SSDs, which 256 makes sense.\n\n207\n00:10:43.583 --> 00:10:49.830\nThat's kind of a binary number, or a\nnumber that easily calculable with binary.\n\n208\n00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.967\nBut then you'll see a 240-Gig SSD, and\n\n209\n00:10:51.967 --> 00:10:54.290\nthat's kinda an odd number\nto throw out there.\n\n210\n00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.700\nBut they can kinda do whatever they\nwant with SSDs cuz it's memory sizes.\n\n211\n00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.360\nThey can choose the size.\n\n212\n00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.110\nSo that all does come into play,\nand it impacts things.\n\n213\n00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:06.250\nNow I mentioned, we don't care about this\nin a lot of cases cuz storage is cheap.\n\n214\n00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.560\nAnd we can get a lot of it.\n\n215\n00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.421\nIt's not always like that.\n\n216\n00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:13.762\nIf you're trying to move your data center\ninto the SSD world, SSD is more expensive,\n\n217\n00:11:13.762 --> 00:11:17.560\nso you're gonna be a little\nmore strict about that storage.\n\n218\n00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.460\nAnd you're not gonna say,\nI can just add more.\n\n219\n00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.740\nFor example, you might have a server that\nonly has room for 2 hard drives in it.\n\n220\n00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.140\nAnd if you've got the two biggest\ndrives you can get in there,\n\n221\n00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.650\nyou can't add more without\ngoing to external arrays.\n\n222\n00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.290\nAnd so that may not be an option.\n\n223\n00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:35.290\nSo now you wanna trim back on\nthe amount of space people consume.\n\n224\n00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.460\nUsually, we don't worry about it, but back\nin the day, we worried about it a lot.\n\n225\n00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.960\nBack when you just didn't\nhave a lot of storage.\n\n226\n00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.710\nAnd so there are a number of techniques\nbuilt into pretty much every server\n\n227\n00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:50.000\noperating system that help you control\nthe amount of growth on your hard drives.\n\n228\n00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.230\nNow even if money is no object, and\nwe've got a ton of storage where\n\n229\n00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:59.940\nwe're not worried about hitting our limit,\nwe can accidentally hit our limit, too.\n\n230\n00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.327\nThere's things that can occur inside\nof a system that over time will fill up\n\n231\n00:12:03.327 --> 00:12:04.092\nthe hard drive.\n\n232\n00:12:04.092 --> 00:12:07.900\nAnd when a hard drive gets full,\nwhat happens?\n\n233\n00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.700\nWell, it depends on what drive it is.\n\n234\n00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.860\nIf the drive is just a data drive,\nthen I just can't add any more data to it.\n\n235\n00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.160\nIt's not a big deal.\n\n236\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.918\nBut if it's the operating system drive, or\n\n237\n00:12:16.918 --> 00:12:20.010\nmore importantly,\nif it's the drive where my page file is.\n\n238\n00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:25.370\nIf my page file can't grow to\nthe appropriate size, the system freezes.\n\n239\n00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.880\nAnd if the system freezes,\nit's now offline, we've created an outage.\n\n240\n00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.480\nSo we've always gotta monitor hard drive\nutilization, even if we don't care.\n\n241\n00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.530\nEven if we have a ton of storage and\nwe know we're never gonna run out.\n\n242\n00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.013\nYou still need to monitor it\nbecause if something goes wrong and\n\n243\n00:12:39.013 --> 00:12:42.967\nyou do run out of storage, it's gonna\ncause your server to go offline.\n\n244\n00:12:42.967 --> 00:12:44.021\nAnd we definitely don't want that.\n\n245\n00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:45.109\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, or\n\n246\n00:12:45.109 --> 00:12:49.680\nif you have an employee that decides to\nload up a bunch of ISOs on shared storage.\n\n247\n00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.002\nOf course,\nI wouldn't know anything about that.\n\n248\n00:12:51.002 --> 00:12:54.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the employee,\nyou tell them they have a home folder.\n\n249\n00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:55.353\nAnd so they say, well, it's my folder.\n\n250\n00:12:55.353 --> 00:12:57.716\nI'm gonna put my MP3 collection in there.\n\n251\n00:12:57.716 --> 00:12:59.260\nI don't want to use up\nthe Internet bandwidth.\n\n252\n00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.370\nSo I'm gonna put all the files right here,\nso I can just listen to them locally.\n\n253\n00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.080\nPeople do stuff like that,\nand they can fill up a drive.\n\n254\n00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.940\nAgain, if you have a ton of storage,\nmaybe you don't care.\n\n255\n00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.917\nFine, whatever,\nlet them use it how they want.\n\n256\n00:13:08.917 --> 00:13:12.381\nBut in reality, if enough employees do\nthat, you're gonna run out of storage.\n\n257\n00:13:12.381 --> 00:13:16.030\nAnd if it's expensive storage, like SSD,\nyou don't want that to happen.\n\n258\n00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.280\nSo let's talk about some\nways we could prevent this.\n\n259\n00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:25.160\nFirst off, back in the olden days, 10,\n15 years ago, really not that long ago.\n\n260\n00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.170\nWe used to always implement\nwhat were called disk quotas.\n\n261\n00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.340\nAnd a disk quota was where you simply\nlimited the amount of storage that each\n\n262\n00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.480\nemployee had.\n\n263\n00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.940\nI might have 1 shared folder that\nall of my employees can put data in.\n\n264\n00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.560\nBut I assign a 2-gigabyte\nquota to every employee.\n\n265\n00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.990\nAnd now the employees can put\nwhatever they want in there.\n\n266\n00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.772\nBut the moment they hit 2 Gigs,\nthey can´t add anymore.\n\n267\n00:13:46.772 --> 00:13:49.225\nI might have plenty of space\navailable on the drive, but\n\n268\n00:13:49.225 --> 00:13:52.530\nI'm not allowing any 1\nemployee to exceed that limit.\n\n269\n00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.385\nThat's how services like Dropbox work.\n\n270\n00:13:54.385 --> 00:13:58.115\nWhere Dropbox have tons of storage on\nthe back end, they're back by Amazon S3s.\n\n271\n00:13:58.115 --> 00:13:59.560\nThey have tons of storage.\n\n272\n00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.330\nBut, as a customer,\nwhen you sign up you get 5 Gigs, or\n\n273\n00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.810\na 100 Gigs, a terabyte,\nwhatever it is that you pay for.\n\n274\n00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.089\nThat's a quota that's\nbeing applied to you.\n\n275\n00:14:09.089 --> 00:14:11.970\nWell, we can create quotas, ourselves,\nand they're actually pretty easy.\n\n276\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.560\nPretty much every operating system you're\ngonna deal with has quota support, but\n\n277\n00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.490\nit's disabled.\n\n278\n00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:21.770\nI can't think of an operating system right\nnow that has quotas enabled by default.\n\n279\n00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.830\nThere's probably one out there,\nbut I don't know it.\n\n280\n00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.110\nSo if we wanna turn a quota on,\nit's not a hard thing to do.\n\n281\n00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.000\nFor example, in Windows,\nI'll use in Windows.\n\n282\n00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.640\nI'll do Linux here in just a moment.\n\n283\n00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.502\nOn a Windows server,\nif you browse to your computer, and\n\n284\n00:14:34.502 --> 00:14:37.485\nyou pull up all of your hard drives,\nright?\n\n285\n00:14:37.485 --> 00:14:43.710\nSo here I've got a C, D, an E,\nmy D drive is 1.8 terabytes.\n\n286\n00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.730\nHere's another example, where it's\na stripe across 2 1-terabyte drives.\n\n287\n00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:52.771\nI should have 2 terabytes of storage,\nbut I get 1.8 terabytes, right?\n\n288\n00:14:52.771 --> 00:14:57.262\nCuz of the way it's being measured, it\nshows up as smaller than it actually is.\n\n289\n00:14:57.262 --> 00:15:01.310\nBut if I want to apply a quota to this,\nI can pull up the Properties of that disk.\n\n290\n00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.650\nAnd in the Properties for the disk,\nyou'll see a Quota tab right here.\n\n291\n00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.090\nAnd I can come in and\n\n292\n00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:09.920\nEnable quota management, and\nthen I can start to limit it.\n\n293\n00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.790\nI can say limit disk space\nto a particular size.\n\n294\n00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:17.140\nI can say that I don't want\nemployees to have more than,\n\n295\n00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.650\nmaybe I'll go a little bigger than that.\n\n296\n00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.678\n100 gigabytes of storage, right?\n\n297\n00:15:21.678 --> 00:15:23.200\nSo I'm gonna limit them to 100 Gigs.\n\n298\n00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.590\nAnd I'm gonna set\na warning level to 80 Gigs.\n\n299\n00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.800\nThat way,\nwhen somebody hits 80% of their quota,\n\n300\n00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.900\nI'll get an event log message\nthat lets me know about it.\n\n301\n00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.600\nAnd so\nI can reach out to that employee, or\n\n302\n00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.990\nI can automate it where it gets an email.\n\n303\n00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.740\nThey hit 80 Gigs, and\nthey get a message saying, hey,\n\n304\n00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.740\nby the way,\nyou've only got 20% of your storage left.\n\n305\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.780\nI might want to bump that to 90% or\nsomething, right?\n\n306\n00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.880\nAnd we can log the event when\nthey exceed their quota.\n\n307\n00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:53.251\nWe can log an event when they exceed\ntheir warning level, and so on.\n\n308\n00:15:53.251 --> 00:15:57.245\nNow configuring a quota is usually\na little more than just turning it on.\n\n309\n00:15:57.245 --> 00:15:59.590\nBecause you'll have people\nyou wanna override.\n\n310\n00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:03.415\nIf your CEO hits the two gig\nlimit what's gonna happen?\n\n311\n00:16:03.415 --> 00:16:06.590\nThey're just gonna call you and\ntell you to override ride it, that's it.\n\n312\n00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.790\nI'm the CEO I need more\nstorage make it happen.\n\n313\n00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.770\nSo there's some employees that you're\nnot going to want that to apply to.\n\n314\n00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.440\nAnd you might even have\na mixture where yeah some\n\n315\n00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:20.380\nemployees I want to have two gigs but\nsome employees only need 200 megs.\n\n316\n00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.690\nAnd this is just a general\nquota right here.\n\n317\n00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.550\nThis is the default quota limit for\nnew users.\n\n318\n00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:30.350\nBut if I go to quota entries I can pull\nup users that are storing data and\n\n319\n00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.310\nI can override them right?\n\n320\n00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:35.390\nSo here I've got a user that's trying\nto retrieve their name right now.\n\n321\n00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.070\nYeah so retrieving name.\n\n322\n00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:41.380\nSo it will get their name in a minute but\nthis particular user has no limit.\n\n323\n00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.650\nSo I might want to override that.\n\n324\n00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.400\nAnd we can pull up the properties for\nthat user and override it so\n\n325\n00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.940\nthey get something different\nthan what the default is, right?\n\n326\n00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.700\nThis one's actually\nthe administrators group,\n\n327\n00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.090\nI probably don't want to limit\nthe administrators group.\n\n328\n00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:57.380\nBut if I have other employees that get\nadded in here I can come in and change and\n\n329\n00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.310\noverride those.\n\n330\n00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.500\nSo that's basic quota\nmanagement right there.\n\n331\n00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.785\nAll right, now other show hosts use this\ndrive, so I'm gonna turn that quota off.\n\n332\n00:17:05.785 --> 00:17:08.690\n[LAUGH] I don't wanna mess up their\nvirtual machines or anything.\n\n333\n00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.780\nBut that's how it's done in Windows.\n\n334\n00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.950\nIn Linux it's really the same thing.\n\n335\n00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:15.600\nIn Linux you can figure via text files, or\n\n336\n00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.450\nyou can use the various management\nsoftware that's out there.\n\n337\n00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:23.160\nIf you have like, C Panel or Plask,\nor something, I'm using Webmin.\n\n338\n00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.750\nThey make it really easy to go in and\nconfigure those quotas.\n\n339\n00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.320\nIf I go under System, and\n\n340\n00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.860\nDisk Quotas, in here I'll see\nwhere I can set my Disk Quotas.\n\n341\n00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.990\nAnd actually I'm getting a little\nmessage here telling me that none\n\n342\n00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.860\nof my file systems support quotas.\n\n343\n00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:40.520\nIn Linux, when you mount a partition,\nyou have to tell it whether that partition\n\n344\n00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.880\nsupports quotas or not, and apparently\nI haven't turned it on on any of mine.\n\n345\n00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.760\nSo I need to go in and\nfix that real quick.\n\n346\n00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.320\nSo I'm gonna go in and\nI'll pick the Home directory.\n\n347\n00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.360\nThe Home directory is\na great one to limit.\n\n348\n00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.070\nCuz that's where your users on your Linux\nsystem will have folders themselves,\n\n349\n00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.600\nwhere they put their personal data.\n\n350\n00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.030\nAnd so I can go in there, and\nI can turn on quota support for it.\n\n351\n00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.700\nIt's down here in\nthe bottom somewhere here.\n\n352\n00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:05.430\nI can enable user quotas, or\nI can enable group quotas.\n\n353\n00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.560\nGroup quotas are neat,\nbecause I might have a sales team, and\n\n354\n00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.690\nI could have a shared quota\nthat applies to the whole team.\n\n355\n00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.190\nThat whole team gets ten gigs of storage.\n\n356\n00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.500\nI don't care if one user\nuses all ten gigs or\n\n357\n00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.430\nif ten users use one gig each, who cares.\n\n358\n00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.000\nBut the sales team has that limit.\n\n359\n00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.830\nNormally we do it by individual user,\nthough.\n\n360\n00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.910\nSo I'm gonna say this as a user limit and\nI'll save it, we can list the users and\n\n361\n00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.538\ngo in and start to deal with that but\nI'm just gonna turn it on.\n\n362\n00:18:27.538 --> 00:18:32.760\nAll right, and\nwe're gonna make that permanent.\n\n363\n00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:36.780\nIn Linux, you can always make changes that\nare temporary and then you reboot and\n\n364\n00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:37.470\nthey're off.\n\n365\n00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.840\nI chose to make it permanent which\njust writes it to the config file so\n\n366\n00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.530\nit will be there when I reboot.\n\n367\n00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.750\nNow I can go back to my disk quotas and\nthere's my home folder showing up.\n\n368\n00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.240\nAnd it's showing that\nuser quotas are inactive.\n\n369\n00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.720\nSo they're not actually turned on yet.\n\n370\n00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.990\nAnd I can come in and start to\ncustomize that and get those set so\n\n371\n00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:55.830\nthey are up and working.\n\n372\n00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:00.130\nWe can see as we jump in here,\nthis is just the sort options.\n\n373\n00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.660\nBut here's where we can set the email\nmessages for users that go over quota.\n\n374\n00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.950\nWe can set grace times.\n\n375\n00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:09.750\nMaybe I don't wanna worn them during the\nday, it's okay if they go over the limit,\n\n376\n00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.150\nbut at night they'll get the emails or\nwhatever.\n\n377\n00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:16.100\nAnd all the various other\ncommands we use that control\n\n378\n00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.100\nthe quota settings all kind of spread\nthroughout here you can customize and\n\n379\n00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.960\nmanipulate that database on what you want.\n\n380\n00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:27.580\nOne thing that we don't see on here,\nit's configured a different way, is that\n\n381\n00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:32.160\na lot of systems have two different types\nof quotas hard quotas and soft quotas.\n\n382\n00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.950\nA hard quota says if I\ngive you a 2 gig limit and\n\n383\n00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.100\nyou hit 2 gigs you can't write\nanymore data, that's it right?\n\n384\n00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.210\nYou're stuck until you delete something.\n\n385\n00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:45.480\nIf you have a soft quota, you can actually\nexceed the limit, if you exceed the limit\n\n386\n00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.600\nyou're getting warnings, you're getting\nalerts, but you're allowed to exceed it.\n\n387\n00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.090\nAnd sometimes that's a little more useful\ncuz your warning the employees but\n\n388\n00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.330\nyou're not stopping them from\nbeing able to do that at work.\n\n389\n00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.450\nSo, you kinda have to choose\nwhich one you wanna go on.\n\n390\n00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:00.200\nAnother optional feature that we can\nturn on if you're really worried\n\n391\n00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.340\nabout storage is compression.\n\n392\n00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.330\nNow, most of us have work with\ncompression in a form of archives.\n\n393\n00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.940\nLike zip files and RAR and\n\n394\n00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.380\nall those different way we can compress\nthings state and zip whatever.\n\n395\n00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.410\nThose are great for individual files.\n\n396\n00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:17.840\nBut most file systems support\ncompression for the entire hard drive.\n\n397\n00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.510\nNow, I say most of them support it.\n\n398\n00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.830\nA lot of them are actually\ndeprecating it and getting rid of it.\n\n399\n00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.370\nYou see that in the Linux world.\n\n400\n00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:27.620\nBecause storage is cheap these days and\ncompression hurts performance.\n\n401\n00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.370\nPeople are usually more concern about\nperformance than they are about\n\n402\n00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:31.430\nanything else.\n\n403\n00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:36.960\nSo we want to make sure that we only use\nthis type of technology responsibly.\n\n404\n00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.780\nIf I have data storage where performance\nis not a concern, I can compress it and\n\n405\n00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.200\nsave space.\n\n406\n00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.500\nIf I have a folder that's\nstoring backups or\n\n407\n00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:49.200\narchive data, data that I don't go to\nvery often, I can compress the drive.\n\n408\n00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.260\nNot the individual files but\nthe entire drive.\n\n409\n00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:56.000\nIn Windows,\nit's just an option right on the drive.\n\n410\n00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.800\nSo, when I come in to this particular\ncomputer I can take a drive\n\n411\n00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.300\nlike this E drive and\nI can pull up its properties.\n\n412\n00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:09.160\nAnd when I go into its\nsettings we can jump in and\n\n413\n00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:14.600\nyou'll see the option down here where I\ncan compress the drive to save space.\n\n414\n00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.500\nAnd that'll compress everything.\n\n415\n00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.910\nAnd it does it transparently to the users.\n\n416\n00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.160\nThe users,\nthey copy files to the hard drive and\n\n417\n00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.900\nthey get compressed in the background.\n\n418\n00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.560\nAnd then they restore files, or\nwhatever, they open them and\n\n419\n00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.030\nthey're decompressed\nall in the background.\n\n420\n00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:27.510\nThey don't see that.\n\n421\n00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:29.180\nYou can do the whole drive.\n\n422\n00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:33.050\nOr you can do individual folders and\nthat's usually better because\n\n423\n00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:35.080\ndifferent folders might have\ndifferent types of data.\n\n424\n00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.140\nIf you've got folders with applications\nin them you don't want to compress that.\n\n425\n00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.810\nOr if you have a folder\nwith a bunch of images,\n\n426\n00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:41.630\nmost images are all ready compressed.\n\n427\n00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:45.410\nIf you apply compression a second time\nthey actually get bigger because you can't\n\n428\n00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.300\ncompact it anymore and you're adding\na compression header on to it.\n\n429\n00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.760\nSo the file actually grows.\n\n430\n00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.250\nSo there some data that you\ndon't want to compress and\n\n431\n00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:56.220\nthat's where disk space compression\nis not always a great idea.\n\n432\n00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.790\nAnd storage is cheap.\n\n433\n00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.980\nIf I have data that's\ninfrequently accessed,\n\n434\n00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:03.990\ninstead of compressing the drive,\nI could buy a bunch of cheap drives.\n\n435\n00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:07.931\nI might have 15,000 rpm serial\nattached SCSI drives for\n\n436\n00:22:07.931 --> 00:22:11.250\nmy normal stuff or\nSSD for my normal stuff.\n\n437\n00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:11.930\nBut for my archive data?\n\n438\n00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:15.780\nI might have a bunch of SATA drives,\ncheap consumer level SATA drives,\n\n439\n00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:19.440\na bunch of them so\nI get a ton of storage but they're slower.\n\n440\n00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.530\nThey fail more often, but this is data\nthat is not accessed very frequently,\n\n441\n00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:23.550\nso what do I care?\n\n442\n00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:26.680\nThat's how technologies\nlike Amazon's Glacier work.\n\n443\n00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.960\nIs Amazon's Glacier to them,\nreally cheap old storage.\n\n444\n00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.590\nAll the storage they phazed\nout from they're servers.\n\n445\n00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.330\nStorage is more likely to fail,\nthat's why they promised you\n\n446\n00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:38.620\nthat if you wanna get a file out of\nGlacier it will take three hours.\n\n447\n00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.770\nBecause if they have a drive that's\nfailed they've got to wait for\n\n448\n00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:41.960\na rebuild and all that stuff.\n\n449\n00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.230\nThey build all that into the product and\nsome if its coming off tape too and\n\n450\n00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.080\ntape just takes a long time to read.\n\n451\n00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.780\nSo that's a way that they're\nleveraging that older storage and\n\n452\n00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.390\nit's way you can do it too.\n\n453\n00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.820\nLet's see what else do we have?\n\n454\n00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.430\nWe can always be smarter\nabout our storage.\n\n455\n00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:02.540\nThere's actually plenty of spots where\nour system will consume storage if\n\n456\n00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.900\nwe don't pay attention to it.\n\n457\n00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:08.420\nSo if I neglect a server,\nit might have a ton of storage today, and\n\n458\n00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.870\na year from now, the drive is running out.\n\n459\n00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:14.520\nAnd there's a couple of ways that happens,\nin the Linux world, log files.\n\n460\n00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:19.650\nWhen you fire up a Linux box,\nit immediately starts up syslog.\n\n461\n00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:23.490\nI mean if you're on a system desystem\nit's also firing up journal d and\n\n462\n00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:26.150\nboth of those are logging\nevents on the system.\n\n463\n00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.870\nWell if you have a problem on the system\nit's going to generate a log of\n\n464\n00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:29.880\nlog messages.\n\n465\n00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.370\nIt might not affect performance, it might\nnot affect the operation of the server but\n\n466\n00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.220\nit's gonna generate a lot of log messages.\n\n467\n00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:39.150\nAnd over time those logs grow and\nthey grow and they grow.\n\n468\n00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:43.090\nAnd eventually they can fill your hard\ndrive up, and you don't notice, right?\n\n469\n00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.910\nThese log files, just growing and growing.\n\n470\n00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.972\nOn my Red Hat box here,\nif I get into a terminal,\n\n471\n00:23:48.972 --> 00:23:54.064\nthose logs are in /var/log in that folder,\nright there.\n\n472\n00:23:54.064 --> 00:23:57.429\nAnd if you take a look in there\nyou'll see some various things and\n\n473\n00:23:57.429 --> 00:24:00.563\nthe one that's our syslog is\nthis guy right here messages.\n\n474\n00:24:00.563 --> 00:24:04.601\nAnd messages can grow and grow and\ngrow until it fills your drive.\n\n475\n00:24:04.601 --> 00:24:07.578\nNow notice some of these,\nthere's more than one copy.\n\n476\n00:24:07.578 --> 00:24:12.754\nSo messages,\nI've also got messages-20170112.\n\n477\n00:24:12.754 --> 00:24:14.838\nAll right, well, today is January 13th.\n\n478\n00:24:14.838 --> 00:24:17.570\nThat's yesterday's date.\n\n479\n00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.630\nSo what it's doing is\nwhat's called log rotation.\n\n480\n00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.950\nIt took all of yesterday's logs and\nput them in a separate file.\n\n481\n00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.900\nAnd today it's an all new file,\nand it's gonna do that.\n\n482\n00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:31.470\nAnd every so often, every 7 days or\n20 days, it's gonna delete the old stuff.\n\n483\n00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:35.340\nAnd we'll have just the last,\nlet's say, 10 days worth of logs.\n\n484\n00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.350\nLog rotation is a way of preventing that.\n\n485\n00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.516\nBut some systems, like Microsoft Windows,\n\n486\n00:24:39.516 --> 00:24:41.918\nare configured not to do\nlog rotation by default.\n\n487\n00:24:41.918 --> 00:24:46.324\nAnd there's many Linux distributions that\nare not configured to do log rotation.\n\n488\n00:24:46.324 --> 00:24:50.800\nMost BSD systems don't do log rotation,\nbecause they want you to have the logs.\n\n489\n00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.860\nSo you need to know to go in and\ncheck, and\n\n490\n00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:56.060\nmake sure that those aren't filling up and\nconsuming your drive.\n\n491\n00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:59.410\nIf you have antivirus software,\nthose are the same way.\n\n492\n00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.585\nThey'll fill up your drive with logs,\nif you're not careful.\n\n493\n00:25:02.585 --> 00:25:04.235\nI've seen Symantec Antivirus do it.\n\n494\n00:25:04.235 --> 00:25:07.305\nOr Symantec Endpoint Security,\nI've seen it do it numerous times.\n\n495\n00:25:07.305 --> 00:25:09.395\n&gt;&gt; There was one situation\nthat I ran into, and\n\n496\n00:25:09.395 --> 00:25:11.935\nit's kinda interesting that\nit's timing is perfect.\n\n497\n00:25:11.935 --> 00:25:15.115\nI've got an older Windows\n8.1 machine on my network,\n\n498\n00:25:15.115 --> 00:25:19.740\nand I didn't realize I had\nturned off the automatic update.\n\n499\n00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.040\nIt's on an older drive,\nolder solid state drive.\n\n500\n00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.739\nI've only got 80 gigs and I tell you,\nnext time, I have to pay attention.\n\n501\n00:25:24.739 --> 00:25:26.699\nBecause the moment I\nturned on Windows Update,\n\n502\n00:25:26.699 --> 00:25:29.346\nwe're talking about the last time\nI updated was over a year ago.\n\n503\n00:25:29.346 --> 00:25:30.542\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Nice.\n\n504\n00:25:30.542 --> 00:25:33.820\nGood to practice proper\nsecurity procedures.\n\n505\n00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.470\nNot a critical production system, right.\n\n506\n00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:41.015\nBut speaking of Windows updates, did you\nknow that the Windows operating system\n\n507\n00:25:41.015 --> 00:25:43.840\ncaches every single\nupdate it ever applies?\n\n508\n00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.816\nYou keep a copy of it.\nEven though you've already applied\n\n509\n00:25:45.816 --> 00:25:47.324\nthe update, you keep a copy of it.\n\n510\n00:25:47.324 --> 00:25:49.440\nAnd that'll fill up your hard drive.\n\n511\n00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.560\nLet's take a look at this Windows server.\n\n512\n00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.339\nSo this is a Windows Server 2012 R2\nmachine, no, Windows Server 2016.\n\n513\n00:25:55.339 --> 00:25:56.213\nThis is the latest and greatest.\n\n514\n00:25:56.213 --> 00:26:02.350\nIt's been up and running probably for\na year now, this particular machine.\n\n515\n00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:05.380\nAnd so it's up and it's going,\nand it's doing updates.\n\n516\n00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.200\nIt was actually annoying me with\nan update right before this show, so\n\n517\n00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.040\nit's doing its updates.\n\n518\n00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.310\nAnd as it does those updates,\nit's saving them on the hard drive.\n\n519\n00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:18.510\nIf I browse into this,\nI'm gonna go to C and then into Windows.\n\n520\n00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:21.300\nInside of your Windows folder,\nthere's a folder called WinSxS.\n\n521\n00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:27.770\nThis guy right here, SxS, all right.\n\n522\n00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:32.240\nIt is caching every single update\nthat this system has ever applied.\n\n523\n00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.318\nIf you browse into it,\nlook at all these files.\n\n524\n00:26:35.318 --> 00:26:37.942\nThese are all folders\nthat contain the updates.\n\n525\n00:26:37.942 --> 00:26:42.273\nSo here's a bunch of ACPI updates,\nand dashboard updates and so on,\n\n526\n00:26:42.273 --> 00:26:44.520\nthat this system has taken.\n\n527\n00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:51.120\nAnd if I highlight them all here,\n17,573 updates.\n\n528\n00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.697\nThat's a lot of updates.\n\n529\n00:26:52.697 --> 00:26:56.423\nAnd if I take a look at the size\nof that folder as a whole,\n\n530\n00:26:56.423 --> 00:26:58.368\nI think I saw it a second ago.\n\n531\n00:26:58.368 --> 00:27:02.930\nIt was about 6.5 gigs, so\nlet's let that tally up.\n\n532\n00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:08.720\nSo that's gonna add up here, and it's\ngonna be about 6.5 gigabytes of updates.\n\n533\n00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:13.890\nNow, if I've got a 128 gig SSD for\nmy operating system, which is usually\n\n534\n00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:17.790\nplenty for an OS, and then I've got a\nbunch of other drives for my data, right.\n\n535\n00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:23.010\n128 gig drive for my OS, and\nI'm consuming 6.5 gigs here.\n\n536\n00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:26.520\nThat's a decent chunk of that storage,\nand it's only gonna grow.\n\n537\n00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.820\nIt's gonna get bigger, and bigger, and\nbigger, the longer we run the system.\n\n538\n00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.350\nSo we've got to be sure\nthat we monitor that.\n\n539\n00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.463\nMicrosoft will tell you,\nhey when you install Windows,\n\n540\n00:27:33.463 --> 00:27:35.102\nyou only need 20 gigs of hard drive space.\n\n541\n00:27:35.102 --> 00:27:37.100\nAnd that's true, on day one.\n\n542\n00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:41.580\nBut over time, you're gonna get patches,\nyou're gonna get updates.\n\n543\n00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.350\nYou're gonna install software,\nlog files are gonna grow.\n\n544\n00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:46.170\nAll these things are gonna happen.\n\n545\n00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:49.954\nAnd that operating system that used\nto take 20 gigs on the hard drive,\n\n546\n00:27:49.954 --> 00:27:52.113\nnow takes 36 or 40 gigs, 50 gigs.\n\n547\n00:27:52.113 --> 00:27:54.044\nIt starts growing, and\ngrowing, and growing.\n\n548\n00:27:54.044 --> 00:27:55.986\nSo that's why we have to monitor.\n\n549\n00:27:55.986 --> 00:28:01.187\nYou might have spec-ed it perfectly for\nday 1, but not day 100 or day 1000.\n\n550\n00:28:01.187 --> 00:28:03.767\n&gt;&gt; Don, I know you've had a lot of work,\n\n551\n00:28:03.767 --> 00:28:07.004\nyou've done a lot of\nwork inside of databases.\n\n552\n00:28:07.004 --> 00:28:10.024\nIs there anything that we might have to\nworry about when it comes to a database\n\n553\n00:28:10.024 --> 00:28:11.245\nand the storage capacities?\n\n554\n00:28:11.245 --> 00:28:15.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, databases, just by nature,\nand same thing for file servers.\n\n555\n00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.240\nWhen you bring them up, yeah,\nyou've created a database or\n\n556\n00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.220\nyou've populated your file server.\n\n557\n00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.380\nAnd now you open it to the end users.\n\n558\n00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.080\nWell, what do the users do?\n\n559\n00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.530\nThey add data, right?\n\n560\n00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:29.440\nAnd if we're adding some records\nto the system, then it grows.\n\n561\n00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.840\nAnd if we're adding tons of records\nto the systems, it grows really fast.\n\n562\n00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.340\nSo for example, we'll use WordPress.\n\n563\n00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:42.050\nThe ITProTV website used\nto be entirely WordPress.\n\n564\n00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:44.560\nI think there's only two or three\npages now that are part of WordPress.\n\n565\n00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.800\nBut it used to be entirely WordPress.\n\n566\n00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.440\nAnd we had a database for users.\n\n567\n00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.260\nWell, when we first opened for\n\n568\n00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.350\nbusiness, we were adding a handful\nof users every single day.\n\n569\n00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.800\nAnd so the user database\nstarted to grow a little bit.\n\n570\n00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.246\nWell, then when our service\nstarted to catch on,\n\n571\n00:28:58.246 --> 00:29:01.373\nwe started adding hundreds\nof users per day.\n\n572\n00:29:01.373 --> 00:29:05.277\nAnd now we're in the tens of thousands or\nwhatever.\n\n573\n00:29:05.277 --> 00:29:06.913\nWhere it's this giant user database,\n\n574\n00:29:06.913 --> 00:29:09.157\nwhere there's tons of users\nthat are going in there.\n\n575\n00:29:09.157 --> 00:29:11.327\nAnd that database is growing even faster.\n\n576\n00:29:11.327 --> 00:29:14.977\nAnd databases are tricky because,\nremember, you never write to a database,\n\n577\n00:29:14.977 --> 00:29:17.640\nYou always write to\ntheir transaction logs.\n\n578\n00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:21.320\nSo the transaction logs grow, and\nthen they write to the database and\n\n579\n00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:21.880\nthe database grows.\n\n580\n00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:22.639\nSo you're really writing everything twice.\n\n581\n00:29:22.639 --> 00:29:26.401\nIt takes twice the space, and\nyou can run out of hard drive space.\n\n582\n00:29:26.401 --> 00:29:29.130\nAnd that's why we divide things up so\nmuch.\n\n583\n00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:33.467\nOn a file server, on a database server,\nyour operating system is on one partition,\n\n584\n00:29:33.467 --> 00:29:35.310\nyour data is on another partition.\n\n585\n00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.620\nAnd if you have transaction logs,\nthey're on a third partition.\n\n586\n00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.300\nYou might move your page file or\nyour swap to a separate partition, so\n\n587\n00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.630\nthat they can't bump into each other's and\nimpact each other.\n\n588\n00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:48.270\nAnd if you're running application servers,\nright, any miscellaneous type application,\n\n589\n00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:50.870\nyou need to understand the storage\nthat application uses and\n\n590\n00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:53.240\nmake sure you account for\nit just like anything else.\n\n591\n00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.180\nIt's all part of the solution.\n\n592\n00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:00.580\nAnd then lastly, remember that just\nbecause hard drive space is cheap,\n\n593\n00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.500\ndoesn't mean you should keep\nall of your data online and\n\n594\n00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.170\navailable at every single moment.\n\n595\n00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:08.790\nYou're going to have data that nobody\nuses anymore, that's really old stuff.\n\n596\n00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:11.120\nWe have that,\nwe have all our video footage here.\n\n597\n00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.956\nAnd we have episodes that\nwe filmed four years ago,\n\n598\n00:30:12.956 --> 00:30:15.916\nepisodes that aren't even on the website\nanymore because the material is dated.\n\n599\n00:30:15.916 --> 00:30:17.557\nAnd it has been re-filmed and replaced.\n\n600\n00:30:17.557 --> 00:30:21.810\nBut we keep it,\nthat's part of our archive.\n\n601\n00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:23.570\nWe don't need that on our fast storage.\n\n602\n00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:24.900\nWe don't need that\navailable on the network.\n\n603\n00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.930\nIt's a rare day when somebody says,\n\n604\n00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:29.470\ncan I get that video footage that\nyou guys shot four years ago?\n\n605\n00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:34.500\nI really need to learn something about\nWindows Vista or something ancient.\n\n606\n00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.614\nWell, we don't need that very often.\n\n607\n00:30:36.614 --> 00:30:39.902\nSo it doesn't matter if it's burned on\na DVD and stuck on a shelf somewhere.\n\n608\n00:30:39.902 --> 00:30:40.910\nWe can go and get it.\n\n609\n00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:44.450\nIt doesn't have to be on our SAN and\nthen available at this very moment.\n\n610\n00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:49.655\nSo archival data is data that\nwe don't need immediately.\n\n611\n00:30:49.655 --> 00:30:53.425\nAnd we can afford to put it on cheaper\nstorage, lower redundancy storage,\n\n612\n00:30:53.425 --> 00:30:57.675\neven slow or a remote storage it\ntakes a while for us to get to.\n\n613\n00:30:57.675 --> 00:31:01.692\nThat helps to take a lot of pressure\noff of your server storage.\n\n614\n00:31:01.692 --> 00:31:04.371\nAll right, I think as far as\nstorage capacity is concerned,\n\n615\n00:31:04.371 --> 00:31:06.273\nthat's the basics of what we need to know.\n\n616\n00:31:06.273 --> 00:31:10.480\nDo understand that in the world of SANs,\nstorage area networks,\n\n617\n00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.400\nyou can have so much storage.\n\n618\n00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.100\nAnd it's so easy to slice it and apply it,\n\n619\n00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.570\nthat we really don't worry about a lot\nof the stuff that we talked about here.\n\n620\n00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:20.530\nBut when you're dealing with cloud\ntype solutions where you're paying for\n\n621\n00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:24.350\nevery single gigabyte, you really start\npaying attention to that storage.\n\n622\n00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:28.690\nIf I'm paying $0.10 per gigabyte, and\nthe Microsoft updates are consuming 8\n\n623\n00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:33.660\ngigs on my hard drive, then it's\ngonna be costing me $0.80 a month.\n\n624\n00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.380\nNow, that doesn't sound like a big deal.\n\n625\n00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.060\n$0.80 a month, who cares?\n\n626\n00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:41.180\nWhat if I have 100 servers,\nnow it becomes $8 a month.\n\n627\n00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.700\nAnd if you do that over the course of\nyears, it adds up to a substantial amount.\n\n628\n00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.930\nSo those are things that we need\nto be paying attention to and\n\n629\n00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:49.020\ntrying to keep under control.\n\n630\n00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.160\n&gt;&gt; Don, a lot of great information.\n\n631\n00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.500\nI know that's always been confusing.\n\n632\n00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:56.635\nIs it a giga or gigy bite,\nis it 1,000 megs is it 1,024?\n\n633\n00:31:56.635 --> 00:31:59.410\nSo I appreciate you telling us\nall that great information.\n\n634\n00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:01.743\nIt does look like we're running to\nthe end of another great episode.\n\n635\n00:32:01.743 --> 00:32:05.291\nBut before we do, Don, do you have any\nparting words when it comes to storage\n\n636\n00:32:05.291 --> 00:32:07.850\ncapacities inside of our\nserver environments today?\n\n637\n00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:11.100\n&gt;&gt; The main lesson I want you to take away\nhere is monitor, monitor your storage.\n\n638\n00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.336\nIt's super easy to monitor, right?\n\n639\n00:32:12.336 --> 00:32:15.170\nWe can use SNMP, CIM, WMI,\n\n640\n00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:17.470\nthere's all sorts of different\ntechnologies we can use.\n\n641\n00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:21.375\nIn the Linux world, there's some amazing\nopen source stuff like Zabbix and\n\n642\n00:32:21.375 --> 00:32:24.440\nNagios that let you easily monitor\nthe storage on your servers.\n\n643\n00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.110\nIt not something that should\never sneak up on you.\n\n644\n00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.810\nYou should see it slowly growing and\n\n645\n00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:31.240\nbe able to trend out in the future,\nwhen am I gonna run out of storage?\n\n646\n00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.180\nI can see right here on my current pace,\n\n647\n00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.100\nsix months from now I'm\ngonna run out of storage.\n\n648\n00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.240\nPlenty of time to put more storage\nin the budget, or troubleshoot and\n\n649\n00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.000\nfree up storage, and resolve the issue.\n\n650\n00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.010\nYou should never be blindsided\nby a storage issue.\n\n651\n00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:45.920\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, great information,\nthanks for joining us in the studio.\n\n652\n00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.317\nIt's been a pleasure having\nyou out there with us.\n\n653\n00:32:47.317 --> 00:32:50.229\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes

00:00:11.735\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.735 --> 00:00:14.929\nWelcome to another exciting\nepisode here here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.590\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.782\nAnd in today's episode we are continuing\nthrough our CompTia Server+ SK0-004.\n\n7\n00:00:21.782 --> 00:00:24.370\nAnd we're gonna be looking\nat physical security today.\n\n8\n00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.000\nJoining us in the studios,\nit's non other than Mr. Don Bizet.\n\n9\n00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.170\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.190\n&gt;&gt; I'm ready, Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.920\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n12\n00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.462\n&gt;&gt; Let's get physical.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:31.462 --> 00:00:33.630\n&gt;&gt; We need some Olivia Newton-John music.\n\n14\n00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.409\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because we're gonna get\n\n15\n00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:35.112\nphysical in this episode.\n\n16\n00:00:35.112 --> 00:00:36.942\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n17\n00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:39.210\nin this episode we're talking\nabout physical security.\n\n18\n00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.360\nAnd it is super important.\n\n19\n00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.050\nIt's super important and it's super easy.\n\n20\n00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.200\nSo really, it's something we\nshould all be implementing.\n\n21\n00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.560\nBut so many people don't\nthat it's almost painful.\n\n22\n00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.130\nWhen you talk about servers,\nand you talk about security,\n\n23\n00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.560\nyou'll hear people talk about full disk\nencryption, and firewalls, and deep\n\n24\n00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.540\npacket inspection, and intrusion detection\ndevices, and all this crazy stuff.\n\n25\n00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.412\nAnd then it's just super simple to shut\ntheir data center down because they\n\n26\n00:01:03.412 --> 00:01:05.451\ndidn't take the precautions for\nphysical security.\n\n27\n00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:10.140\nThere are steps we can take to ensure\nthat our data centers are safe.\n\n28\n00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.450\nAnd they should start with keeping\npeople out of the data center.\n\n29\n00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.940\nBecause if somebody can\nget into the data center,\n\n30\n00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.520\na lot of the fancy technical jargon we\nthrow around really doesn't do any good.\n\n31\n00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.620\nSo for example,\nthe servers right behind me.\n\n32\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.570\nIf somebody were to get into that room and\n\n33\n00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.500\nthey didn't know the first\nthing about a computer,\n\n34\n00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.610\nthey don't know how to do a man in\nthe middle attack, or anything like that.\n\n35\n00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.640\nThey can just walk around and\nunplug power cables.\n\n36\n00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.800\nIt's that simple, and\nnow my servers are offline,\n\n37\n00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.120\nthey just created an outage because\nthey unplugged power cables.\n\n38\n00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.584\nThey could pour water on a server.\n\n39\n00:01:42.584 --> 00:01:45.190\nIt's not like a plant,\nwhere it's gonna be happy about that.\n\n40\n00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.820\nYou just pour water on the server and\nit'll short out and\n\n41\n00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.370\nshut down, problem solved, right.\n\n42\n00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.610\nSo those are challenges we\nhave to be able to overcome.\n\n43\n00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.590\nAnd it even extends beyond just that room.\n\n44\n00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.390\nFor example, there's an air conditioning\nunit that powers just that room.\n\n45\n00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.080\nThat air conditioning unit has\nan external fan outside of our building.\n\n46\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.820\nSomebody could walk up to that exterior\nunit and just take a big stick or\n\n47\n00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.630\na metal meter stick or whatever, and\nstick it right down in there and\n\n48\n00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.170\nstop the fan from spinning.\n\n49\n00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.210\nWell, now the hot air is\nnot leaving the building.\n\n50\n00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.090\nWhere's the hot air going?\n\n51\n00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.783\nRight there, and staying in that room.\n\n52\n00:02:19.783 --> 00:02:22.332\nThe temperature builds up,\nyou get a thermal shutdown,\n\n53\n00:02:22.332 --> 00:02:24.600\nyour data center's offline.\n\n54\n00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.020\nAs simple as that.\n\n55\n00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.520\nPhysical security should\nnot be overlooked.\n\n56\n00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.917\nIt's harder because somebody has\nto be here to use it, right?\n\n57\n00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:36.891\nSo a hacker in a foreign country is not\ngoing to pull off a physical security\n\n58\n00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:38.900\nattack on your data center.\n\n59\n00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.630\nIt's usually going to be an employee or\na former employee or\n\n60\n00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.520\na business rival that happens\nto be in that same area.\n\n61\n00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.250\nCuz then it's easy for\nthem to gain physical access or\n\n62\n00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.900\nto at least be within\nproximity of your location.\n\n63\n00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.891\n&gt;&gt; So Don what you're saying is we always\nthink technical when we think of denial of\n\n64\n00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:54.838\nservice attacks right?\n\n65\n00:02:54.838 --> 00:02:55.849\nA SYN flood attack,\n\n66\n00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.550\na buffer overflow attack, or just ping\nthe server until it goes offline.\n\n67\n00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.250\nAnd you're saying that a denial of service\nattack could be as simple as taking\n\n68\n00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.130\na blanket and throwing it over\nan exhaust port on the roof,\n\n69\n00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.440\ncreating thermal temperature shut downs.\n\n70\n00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.970\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n71\n00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.986\nAnd there's countless stories, where\npeople have shut down really advanced data\n\n72\n00:03:10.986 --> 00:03:12.591\ncenters through simple tactics like that.\n\n73\n00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:15.070\nAnd it's a reality.\n\n74\n00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.580\nSo we've gotta make sure\nwe take precautions\n\n75\n00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.410\nto secure our environment, right?\n\n76\n00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.180\nSo let's talk about physical security.\n\n77\n00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.230\nPhysical security takes\nmany different forms.\n\n78\n00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.070\nAny type of security, really,\ntakes many different forms.\n\n79\n00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.690\nBut it starts with making sure that\n\n80\n00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.040\nonly authorized people have\naccess to your servers.\n\n81\n00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.720\nWell, how do you know if\nsomebody's authorized or not?\n\n82\n00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.240\nYou need some kind of\ncredentialing system.\n\n83\n00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.540\nA credentialing system is where\npeople have to prove they are who\n\n84\n00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.580\nthey say they are.\n\n85\n00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.850\nSo if there's a data center out there and\nI just walk right up to the door and\n\n86\n00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:47.920\nI say hi I'm Don.\n\n87\n00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.000\nI'm going to use my real name.\n\n88\n00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.880\nI'm Don Bizet, I'm with Dell.\n\n89\n00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.660\nI'm here to do a warranty\nrepair on one of your servers.\n\n90\n00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.530\nCan you take me to your server room?\n\n91\n00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.530\nAnd they'll say well,\nI'll need to see some credentials.\n\n92\n00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.300\nAnd I'll say,\nI've got my Dell t-shirt on or whatever.\n\n93\n00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.920\nAnybody can get a Dell shirt.\n\n94\n00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.150\nAnd as long as you've got a tool kit and\na little rolling cart,\n\n95\n00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.320\npeople will believe you're a technician.\n\n96\n00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.190\nThat's all it takes.\n\n97\n00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.300\nAnd now you're socially\nengineering your way in.\n\n98\n00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.240\nAnd they walk you into the server room and\noff you go, right?\n\n99\n00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.780\nSo If I had a better way to prove\nthat yeah, I work for Dell, or\n\n100\n00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.230\nI work for HPE, or\n\n101\n00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.410\nwhoever, then they would be able to tell\nwhether I was telling the truth or not.\n\n102\n00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.033\nAnd if I obviously didn't work for that\nvendor they could just turn me away, and\n\n103\n00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:26.966\nthey were now safe.\n\n104\n00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:29.870\nSo that's credentialing\non a physical side.\n\n105\n00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.880\nWe do credentialing on\na virtual side every day.\n\n106\n00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.820\nYou log into your email, you provide\na username and a password, right?\n\n107\n00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.860\nUsername and a password.\n\n108\n00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.920\nThe username is public.\n\n109\n00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.570\nEverybody knows that.\n\n110\n00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.760\nThat doesn't count for anything.\n\n111\n00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.300\nSo, it's really just the password.\n\n112\n00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.840\nYou know a password.\n\n113\n00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.120\nAnd because you know it,\nyou must be you, right?\n\n114\n00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.980\nThat's how we're validating.\n\n115\n00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.460\nWhich we all know,\nis not necessarily true.\n\n116\n00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.300\nI can tell my password to Wes.\n\n117\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.260\nAnd now Wes can log in to\nthe computer as me, and\n\n118\n00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.360\nthe computer would think that he was me.\n\n119\n00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.010\nCuz he knows the password, he must be Don.\n\n120\n00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.520\nThat's as smart as your\ncomputer's gonna get.\n\n121\n00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.690\nYour computer is only as\nsmart as you make it and\n\n122\n00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.610\nwe haven't made them terribly smart.\n\n123\n00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.520\nSo, what we just saw\nthere with passwords or\n\n124\n00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.630\nwhat we just heard is what's\ncalled something you know.\n\n125\n00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.160\nIn authentication,\nthere's really three methods.\n\n126\n00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.050\nSomething you know,\nsomething you have or something you are.\n\n127\n00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.410\nSomething you know is the most\ncommon password, right?\n\n128\n00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.000\nI know a password.\n\n129\n00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.030\nIf I go to an ATM machine,\nI put my ATM card in and\n\n130\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.560\nI tell it to give me 100 bucks,\nit's gonna ask me for a PIN number.\n\n131\n00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.510\nThe PIN number is something I know.\n\n132\n00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.920\nIt's a personal identification number,\nPIN.\n\n133\n00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.850\nI know it, if somebody else knows my pin,\nthey're now me too.\n\n134\n00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.978\nAnd that's the weakness of something you\nknow, somebody else can figure it out.\n\n135\n00:05:36.978 --> 00:05:39.844\nBut passwords, pins,\nthat's something you know.\n\n136\n00:05:39.844 --> 00:05:41.760\nThen there's something you have.\n\n137\n00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.199\nSomething you have could be as\nsimple as an ID badge, right?\n\n138\n00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.360\nID badge, so I've got my ID badge here for\nthe ITProTV building.\n\n139\n00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.890\nBecause I have this,\nI'm supposed to be here, right?\n\n140\n00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.180\nWell, ID badges can be forged, can't they?\n\n141\n00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.890\nAnybody can fire up a printer,\nand put an ID on here, and\n\n142\n00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.950\nthey're able to get in the building.\n\n143\n00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.510\nWell, sometimes the something you have\ngets a little more advanced than that.\n\n144\n00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.990\nThis one has an RFID chip in it.\n\n145\n00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.010\nAnd so, when I walk into the building,\nI am able to hold this up to a scanner and\n\n146\n00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.420\nit reads the RFID chip.\n\n147\n00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.310\nSo, just printing a card like\nthis might be good enough for\n\n148\n00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.090\nwalking through the hallway.\n\n149\n00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.820\nBut it won't get you through a door unless\nthey can match that RFID chip, right?\n\n150\n00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:18.890\nSomething you have.\n\n151\n00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.291\nThey can even be more advanced, for\n\n152\n00:06:20.291 --> 00:06:23.060\nexample, I'm just gonna dig through\nmy pockets this whole episode.\n\n153\n00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.520\nMy very, very beaten YubiKey.\n\n154\n00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.890\nSo when I log in to my computer and\nI go to log in to my email or\n\n155\n00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.260\nmy file server or several other\ndifferent things that I have.\n\n156\n00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.790\nI have a Google Chromebook.\n\n157\n00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.580\nAny time I turn the Google Chromebook on,\nit says insert your security key.\n\n158\n00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.870\nAnd I take this little key,\nand I plug it in the side.\n\n159\n00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.980\nAnd I tap the button right there,\nso it can transmit my key, and\n\n160\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.260\nit lets me into the system.\n\n161\n00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.606\nIt's something I have.\n\n162\n00:06:49.606 --> 00:06:53.410\nNow if you were to beat me up and\ntake this key, now you have what I had.\n\n163\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:54.959\nNow it's something I had,\nnot something I have.\n\n164\n00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.890\nSo when you take this key you\ncan now pretend to be me.\n\n165\n00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.220\nYou plug it in, touch a button and\nnow you're me, congratulations, right?\n\n166\n00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.940\nNow you get to work [LAUGH].\nSo that's something I have.\n\n167\n00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.940\nAnd then there's something you are.\n\n168\n00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.850\nSomething you are is your physical being.\n\n169\n00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.310\nAnd that's normally going to be things\nlike your fingerprint, your thumbprint.\n\n170\n00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:20.060\nRetinal scan, blood sample, hair sample,\nvoice recognition, facial recognition.\n\n171\n00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.610\nThat's something you are.\n\n172\n00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.740\nThere's companies like Microsoft that's\nmaking a big push with Windows Hello to\n\n173\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:25.476\nidentify people.\n\n174\n00:07:25.476 --> 00:07:27.700\nAnd we've had fingerprint for a while.\n\n175\n00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.570\nMost laptops have a fingerprint\nreader built into them.\n\n176\n00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.520\nBut now they're getting\ninto facial recognition.\n\n177\n00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.290\nThe problem with facial recognition\nis it's easy to fake, right?\n\n178\n00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.460\nSo you could hold a picture up\nof somebody and you'll pass it.\n\n179\n00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.780\nAnd that's why the new ones use\ninfrared cameras, where they can tell,\n\n180\n00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.130\nis there body heat?\n\n181\n00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.290\nIs it three dimensional?\n\n182\n00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.810\nThey can actually tell that stuff and\n\n183\n00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.192\nit defeats the old hold\nup a picture type thing.\n\n184\n00:07:48.192 --> 00:07:50.900\nSo there's different technologies\nthat are available there, but\n\n185\n00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.560\nit's something you are,\nit's your physical being.\n\n186\n00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.810\nI can't share my fingerprints with Wes.\n\n187\n00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.750\nI can't say, hey Wes when you get bored\ncan you log in as me and do some work,\n\n188\n00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:59.345\nhere's my face.\n\n189\n00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:01.502\n[SOUND] Well,\nit was that stupid John Travolta movie I\n\n190\n00:08:01.502 --> 00:08:02.500\nguess-\n&gt;&gt; Face Off.\n\n191\n00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.656\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, all right,\nwell maybe you can do that.\n\n192\n00:08:04.656 --> 00:08:06.168\nAll right,\ncuz everything in movies is true.\n\n193\n00:08:06.168 --> 00:08:10.697\nBut I can't share my fingerprint, well we\ncould get more of it, I guess you could,\n\n194\n00:08:10.697 --> 00:08:11.690\nwell never mind.\n\n195\n00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.670\nAll right, so there's ways, right?\n\n196\n00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.800\nMy voice, that would be a little harder,\nsomebody could record that, but\n\n197\n00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.780\nthere's ways of detecting a recording.\n\n198\n00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.700\nThe point is,\nall three of these have weaknesses.\n\n199\n00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.290\nSomething you are, something you have,\nsomething you know.\n\n200\n00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.630\nThere's a weakness to each one.\n\n201\n00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.990\nBut if we use more than one,\nif we go multi-factor,\n\n202\n00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.270\nnow we can really start\nto shore things up.\n\n203\n00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.470\nSo when I wave my little YubiKey around,\nand I said hey,\n\n204\n00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:44.740\nyou can just beat me up and take this key,\nor actually this is another RFID fob.\n\n205\n00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.790\nI probably have a radiation\nfootprint that's pretty big.\n\n206\n00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.990\nBut I've got another RFID fob here.\n\n207\n00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.410\nSame idea, you can beat me up and\ntake this fob and now you've got it.\n\n208\n00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.740\nYou're now me.\n\n209\n00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.170\nBut, what if I use this in\nconjunction with a pin number?\n\n210\n00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.880\nI mentioned my\nGoogle Chromebook in my office.\n\n211\n00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.970\nThat if I fire that thing up,\nit's gonna ask me for my key.\n\n212\n00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.410\nBut it actually doesn't ask for\nthe key right away.\n\n213\n00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.550\nIt asks for my username and password.\n\n214\n00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.390\nI have to provide my username and password\nfirst, and then it asks for my key.\n\n215\n00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:17.990\nThis is a second form of authentication,\nor 2FA.\n\n216\n00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.130\nWe used to call it\ndual-factor authentication.\n\n217\n00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.940\nNow they call it\nmulti-factor authentication,\n\n218\n00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.290\ncuz you might have more than two, right?\n\n219\n00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.980\nIf I ever forget this key fob I can say,\nyou know,\n\n220\n00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:33.380\ninstead, let me present\na code from my authenticator.\n\n221\n00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.720\nAnd so, I have an authenticator, which,\nI'm not checking my text messages on\n\n222\n00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.570\nthe show here, I'm actually trying to\nfire up my authenticator real quick, so\n\n223\n00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:44.450\nthat when I go to log in\nI can take my phone and\n\n224\n00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.220\nit'll have a six-digit number on it\nthat's changing every 30 seconds.\n\n225\n00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.180\nAnd so, when I go to log into that laptop,\nif I don't have my key, I can switch and\n\n226\n00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:51.800\nuse this instead.\n\n227\n00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.150\nAgain, something I have.\n\n228\n00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.890\nI have my phone.\n\n229\n00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.500\nIf you were to beat me up and\ntake my phone, you got my authenticator,\n\n230\n00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.970\nyou got my code, but\nyou don't have my password.\n\n231\n00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:05.130\nOr, if you watch over my shoulder and you\nsee my password, you don't have my phone.\n\n232\n00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.322\nSo you don't have my authenticator,\nmy code.\n\n233\n00:10:07.322 --> 00:10:10.260\nYou'd have to have both\nforms of authentication\n\n234\n00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.690\nto be able to access my account and\ngain access to the records.\n\n235\n00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.530\nNow, on a server that becomes a little\nmore challenging to do, right?\n\n236\n00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.640\nOn a server,\nif somebody walks up to it and\n\n237\n00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.060\ngoes to login, do I want them to be able\nto plugin USB keys and all that stuff?\n\n238\n00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.310\nWell, we don't normally let users\naccess our servers directly.\n\n239\n00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.540\nThey're going through a website or\nother service, and\n\n240\n00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.060\nwe can require a multi-factor\nauthentication there pretty easily.\n\n241\n00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.590\nBut for your admins, your admins,\n\n242\n00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.720\nthe ones who need to be able to walk into\nthat server room and check the status,\n\n243\n00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.180\ncheck the temperature, replace\nfailed hard drives, all that stuff.\n\n244\n00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.820\nHow do we know they\nare who they say they are,\n\n245\n00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.010\nwhen they're going into the data center?\n\n246\n00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.000\nAnd, don't think of a little data center,\nlike mine.\n\n247\n00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.380\nWe, what do we have?\n\n248\n00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.380\n30 employees here.\n\n249\n00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.960\nI know every employee by name, so\n\n250\n00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.660\nif there's somebody in the hallway I\ndon't recognize, they're not an employee.\n\n251\n00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.100\nIt's a small company.\n\n252\n00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.000\nBut, if you work for IBM, and\nyou have thousands of technicians and\n\n253\n00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.840\ndata centers that are massive in size,\nthere's no way you know every employee.\n\n254\n00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.470\nAnd you're hiring new employees\neveryday probably, a company that size.\n\n255\n00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.900\nSo, you're constantly\ngoing to see new faces.\n\n256\n00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.710\nHow do you know they should be there?\n\n257\n00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.610\nYou need forms of authentication.\n\n258\n00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:13.680\nThey need to have an ID badge.\n\n259\n00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.200\nThey need to have a fingerprint\nscan to open the door.\n\n260\n00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.750\nYou need to prevent things\nlike tailgating, all right?\n\n261\n00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.660\nLet's talk about tailgating.\n\n262\n00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.700\nIn a lot of data centers,\nwe'll leverage what is called a man trap.\n\n263\n00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.060\nA man trap is where you don't just\ngo through one door to get in,\n\n264\n00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.600\nyou go through two doors, right?\n\n265\n00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.860\nHere's the problem with one door.\n\n266\n00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.960\nWhen I walk up to a door, the front of\nour building here, I scan my card and\n\n267\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.000\nit unlocks the door for\nabout 15 seconds, so long enough for\n\n268\n00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.890\nme to get through the door.\n\n269\n00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.930\nSo I can open it and walk in.\n\n270\n00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.390\nWell 15 seconds is long enough for\nthree or four people to get in.\n\n271\n00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.210\nSo I might open the door with my badge and\nthen three or\n\n272\n00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.840\nfour more people walk right behind me and\ngo through the door cuz I just opened it.\n\n273\n00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.283\nI might even hold the door for\nthem because I'm being nice.\n\n274\n00:11:54.283 --> 00:11:56.128\nHey, here, let me get the door for\nya, right?\n\n275\n00:11:56.128 --> 00:12:00.610\nMeanwhile I'm letting unauthorized\npeople right there into the studios.\n\n276\n00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.410\nRight, so that's not good.\n\n277\n00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.960\nSo it's supposed to be up to the employees\nto know, hey, don't let anybody else in.\n\n278\n00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.310\nBut are they gonna pull that door, and\nhold it, and wait for that 15 seconds?\n\n279\n00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:10.150\nI'm not gonna let you in.\n\n280\n00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.680\nThey're not gonna do that, right?\n\n281\n00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.020\nSo what a man trap does,\nis it puts somebody else in charge.\n\n282\n00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.130\nYou have two sets of door.\n\n283\n00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.150\nThink of it like\nan airlock on a spaceship.\n\n284\n00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.530\nSo, you have an external door and\nan internal door.\n\n285\n00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.620\nThe external door opens and you step in.\n\n286\n00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.620\nThe external door closes and locks.\n\n287\n00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.570\nFor a brief moment,\nboth doors are closed and locked.\n\n288\n00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.830\nThen the interior door opens and\nyou're able to walk in.\n\n289\n00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:40.260\nAnd then it closes and locks and\nthe exterior door opens again.\n\n290\n00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.130\nOne person at a time can come in.\n\n291\n00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.369\nAnd typically, it's a manual operation.\n\n292\n00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:49.160\nThat you have an operator,\nsomebody who's watching that room, so\n\n293\n00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.160\nif two people come in,\nthey don't unlock the interior door.\n\n294\n00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.570\nNo, two people, one of you has to get\nout and just one at a time comes in.\n\n295\n00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:00.220\nIn the big data centers,\nif you were to go to AWS,\n\n296\n00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:04.520\nlike Amazon's, or IBM's, or one of the big\nmission critical ones, they do that.\n\n297\n00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.850\nAnd even their own employees that they\nrecognize, that they know every day\n\n298\n00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:11.610\nit's still limited to one person at\na time coming through that door.\n\n299\n00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.570\nThey might even go bigger than that.\n\n300\n00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.610\nYou'll see it in jails.\n\n301\n00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.030\nI've got a little picture here\nof the exterior of a jail,\n\n302\n00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.040\nwhere they have a vehicle man trap.\n\n303\n00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.400\nWell, it's not really\na man trap at that point.\n\n304\n00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.760\nThey call it a sally port.\n\n305\n00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.900\nSo a sally port is the same thing.\n\n306\n00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.440\nYou have an interior and external door.\n\n307\n00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.500\nSo it's hard to see here, but\nthere's actually two chain-link gates.\n\n308\n00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:35.470\nThe vehicles will come in\nthrough a primary gate and park.\n\n309\n00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:39.910\nAnd the gate closes behind them, and then\nthe secondary gate in front of them opens\n\n310\n00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.450\nup and they're able to drive\nthe rest of the way in.\n\n311\n00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.870\nEvery jail has this, right?\n\n312\n00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:49.030\nA lot of mission critical\ninfrastructure has this.\n\n313\n00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.880\nPower plants have this.\n\n314\n00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.830\nBecause they wanna make sure that\nyou have to come to a complete stop\n\n315\n00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:57.990\nbefore you're allowed in and\nonly one vehicle at a time is getting in.\n\n316\n00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.220\nSo, those technologies can apply to\nserver rooms too and often times do.\n\n317\n00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.850\nIt's very much like an air lock.\n\n318\n00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.340\nAnd sometimes it's done not just for\n\n319\n00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:09.490\nsecurity, but for\nmaintenance reasons also.\n\n320\n00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.830\nIf you have a clean room, you've gotta\nmake sure it's a dust-free environment.\n\n321\n00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:15.290\nDust is really bad on servers.\n\n322\n00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.870\nAnd so that little middle\nroom when you go into it and\n\n323\n00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.300\nit closes you off, might have fans\nthat are designed to capture and\n\n324\n00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.810\nremove dust before you\nmove into the main room.\n\n325\n00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:27.689\nI've seen that in a few places also.\n\n326\n00:14:27.689 --> 00:14:30.313\nAll right, other things, RFID chips.\n\n327\n00:14:30.313 --> 00:14:31.571\nI mentioned RFID chips.\n\n328\n00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:34.900\nI held up my little card,\nwhich doesn't really tell you guys much.\n\n329\n00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.050\nBut here's a picture of what\nan RFID chip looks like.\n\n330\n00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.750\nAnd when I hold up a card like this,\n\n331\n00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:45.220\nthat chip only makes up maybe about\na quarter of the size of this card.\n\n332\n00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.720\nIt's a decent size.\n\n333\n00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.140\nThe chip itself is really, really small.\n\n334\n00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.950\nRight?\nIt's a tiny little chip.\n\n335\n00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:57.330\nMost of this is simply an antenna, because\nthe chip isn't really powering itself.\n\n336\n00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.360\nWhen it comes up to a transmitter the\ntramistter is actually emitting the power\n\n337\n00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.580\nto wake up the chip.\n\n338\n00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:06.190\nSo the RFID chip sitting my pocket,\nI made a joke about radiation footprint,\n\n339\n00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.570\nthe RFID chip in my pocket\nis completely idle.\n\n340\n00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:09.300\nIt's doing nothing.\n\n341\n00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.250\nIt's not generating waves at all.\n\n342\n00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:15.730\nBut when I walk near a sensor, the sensor\nis outputting power and it wakes my chip\n\n343\n00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:20.250\nup, and then it's able to read the ID\noff of it and get the information.\n\n344\n00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.590\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, you've shown us\nthe ones that we use for work.\n\n345\n00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.050\nIn fact, I've got one of those too.\n\n346\n00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.400\nIt's kind of interesting.\n\n347\n00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.310\nHelp me out if it's the same technology.\n\n348\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.540\nI live in an apartment complex, it's a\ngated community, and I use the same thing.\n\n349\n00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.690\nYou have to touch one\nof those little cards.\n\n350\n00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:37.190\nWrite to a pad that opens the gates and\nallows me to go through.\n\n351\n00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:40.445\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and most of them are RFID, some\nof them are still the old magnet cards.\n\n352\n00:15:40.445 --> 00:15:41.733\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; You see those in hotels,\n\n353\n00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:42.390\nlike with doors.\n\n354\n00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.430\nThe problem with magnet cards\nis they get demagnetized,\n\n355\n00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.050\nespecially when they're\nnext to cell phones.\n\n356\n00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:49.770\nAnd, if you're like me, I keep my cell\nphone in my pocket, put my hotel room\n\n357\n00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.950\nkey in my pocket, and all of a sudden\nyour card doesn't work anymore.\n\n358\n00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.980\nSo that's why most of\nthem have moved to RFIDs.\n\n359\n00:15:54.980 --> 00:16:00.790\nRFIDs can hold more data, also,\nthan a standard magnet strip can.\n\n360\n00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.550\nSo, for example, my passport.\n\n361\n00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:06.152\nI have an electronic passport now,\nwhere it's got an RFID chip in it.\n\n362\n00:16:06.152 --> 00:16:10.376\nWhen I walk up to a customs station\nThey can scan my RFID card and\n\n363\n00:16:10.376 --> 00:16:15.088\nthey get my picture, my full\nidentification details, my history,\n\n364\n00:16:15.088 --> 00:16:19.660\nall the black ops stuff they track\non regular citizens these days.\n\n365\n00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.440\nThey can get all that information,\n\n366\n00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.560\na lot of which is stored right\nthere in that RFID chip.\n\n367\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.620\nObviously, the criminal\nhistory isn't stored on there.\n\n368\n00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.670\nBut the picture and\nthose other things are,\n\n369\n00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.530\nbecause you have that room in a RFID chip.\n\n370\n00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.190\nLet's see, what else do we have?\n\n371\n00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.500\nBiometrics.\n\n372\n00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.690\nIt is very common for\na data center to have a biometric scanner.\n\n373\n00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.760\nAnd there's several different kinds.\n\n374\n00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.490\nThere's kinds like this which\ngot a fingerprint scanner or\n\n375\n00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.900\nits got a keypad where you can punch\nin a code or maybe you do both.\n\n376\n00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.380\nNotice this one actually has\na proximity card right here too so\n\n377\n00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.690\nI can hold my card up to it for\nthe RFID scan.\n\n378\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.390\nThis is one scanner that does all three.\n\n379\n00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:58.350\nThis actually looks a lot like the time\nclocks we use here in the building which\n\n380\n00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:01.760\nhave fingerprint,\nkeypad and proximity card.\n\n381\n00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.250\nSo, by doing this though,\n\n382\n00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:07.110\nchecking a fingerprint, I know people\naren't gonna share a fingerprint.\n\n383\n00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:08.190\nIt's too hard.\n\n384\n00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:11.390\nIt's a great way to validate that somebody\nactually is who they say they are,\n\n385\n00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:12.970\nthey have their fingerprint.\n\n386\n00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.210\nAlthough there are weaknesses there, so\n\n387\n00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:19.870\nwe might want fingerprint In combination\nwith a touch pad for a PIN number.\n\n388\n00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:23.040\nYou see palm prints used\nin server rooms a lot.\n\n389\n00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.010\nYou'll see a plate with a couple of\nlittle posts sticking out of it,\n\n390\n00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:28.190\nand the posts are designed to\nfit between your fingers, so\n\n391\n00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.730\nthat you get your palm in the right spot.\n\n392\n00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:33.630\nAnd it'll scan your entire palm,\nthat's even better than a finger print\n\n393\n00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:38.270\nbecause now you're getting far more\nidentity points off of that palm.\n\n394\n00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:41.980\nAnd it's harder to fake an entire\npalm than it is a single print.\n\n395\n00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.750\nSomebody could find an old soda\ncan that I drank off of and\n\n396\n00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.780\npossibly lift a finger\nprint off of that soda can.\n\n397\n00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:51.110\nAnd then they could take that\nfingerprint and make a false finger and\n\n398\n00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.500\nuse it to clear through a checkpoint.\n\n399\n00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.970\nBut to find an entire palm print?\n\n400\n00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:01.030\nThat's a lot harder, they'd have to really\nlook to find that, it's probably rare that\n\n401\n00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:05.120\nI leave a full palm print anywhere,\nso it makes it much more difficult.\n\n402\n00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.170\n&gt;&gt; Don, in some of these technologies\nas you increase their complexity,\n\n403\n00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.700\nit seems like it would\nincrease their cost.\n\n404\n00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.640\nLet me give you an example.\n\n405\n00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:18.020\nSo just well actually, the example you're\ngiving us here with a fingerprint.\n\n406\n00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:21.680\nIf I was to say compare that to a retina\nscanner, that would be a lot more logic,\n\n407\n00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.600\na lot more technology.\n\n408\n00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.720\nThat could potentially be a a bigger cost.\n\n409\n00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.940\nDoes that seem like that it's\na trend that the more secure,\n\n410\n00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.780\nthe potential for more expense as well?\n\n411\n00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of the cost of\nthis stuff is coming down.\n\n412\n00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.540\nFingerprint scanners used to be expensive.\n\n413\n00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.580\nNow they're a commodity item.\n\n414\n00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.980\nYou can pick them up and\nthrow them away whenever you want.\n\n415\n00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.330\nYou can get one for ten bucks.\n\n416\n00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.440\nBut retinal scanners\nare still pretty expensive.\n\n417\n00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.090\nYou are shooting a laser\ninto somebody's eye,\n\n418\n00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:48.130\nwhich is a little invasive but\nthey're pretty darned effective.\n\n419\n00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.720\nThe retinal scan is supposed far more\naccurate than a finger print scan,\n\n420\n00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.570\nbut we haven't had general\nacceptance on that yet.\n\n421\n00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:59.650\nThere's other types of scans\nthat are perfected, but\n\n422\n00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:00.900\njust too expensive to implement.\n\n423\n00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.680\nSo you'll see more and more of those\nthings coming out in the future,\n\n424\n00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.600\nbut usually it's just if your\ndata is sensitive enough,\n\n425\n00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.430\nthen the expense is negligible, right?\n\n426\n00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:15.320\nThat if you think about what it would\ncost you if your data was compromised,\n\n427\n00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.540\nthat's how you should be coming up\nwith your budget for security, right?\n\n428\n00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.850\nA lot of people come up with\nan arbitrary budget for security.\n\n429\n00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:24.110\nI want security to be 10% of\nour bottom line, and that's it.\n\n430\n00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.610\nThat's not how you should look at it.\n\n431\n00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:26.640\nYou should look at it as,\n\n432\n00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.350\nif my servers get compromised,\nhow much is that gonna cost me?\n\n433\n00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.150\nHow big of a public relations\nhit am I gonna take?\n\n434\n00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.180\nHow much of my customer\nbase am I gonna lose?\n\n435\n00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.220\nHow many penalties and fines am I\ngonna have to pay the government for\n\n436\n00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.970\nme not following guidelines?\n\n437\n00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.730\nHow many employees am I gonna\nhave to reeducate or replace?\n\n438\n00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.600\nAll of that stuff factors into a cost.\n\n439\n00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:51.770\nHow much money are we gonna spend just in\ncontract hours to get everything put back\n\n440\n00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:53.960\nto pre-hack status?\n\n441\n00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.170\nThat's all I gotta cost.\n\n442\n00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.450\nAnd that's what your security\nbudget should be based on,\n\n443\n00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.020\nis your preventing that ultimate cost.\n\n444\n00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.630\nAll right, what else do we have?\n\n445\n00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:03.580\nAccess lists.\n\n446\n00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.700\nAccess lists,\nin the sense of physical security,\n\n447\n00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.120\nis a little different than in logical.\n\n448\n00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.330\nWe'll do logical access\nlists in another episode.\n\n449\n00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:15.020\nBut a physical exercise,\nit's a list of names, right?\n\n450\n00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.460\nWhen you walk up to a building.\n\n451\n00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.390\nSo, I used to support a disaster\nrecovery center that was\n\n452\n00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:21.370\nlocated in a co-location facility.\n\n453\n00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:25.570\nSo, we did DR, and our DR facility,\nwe didn't want to pay for\n\n454\n00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.410\na whole data center, so\nwe just rented space in somebody else's.\n\n455\n00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.690\nAnd that's what they did,\nthey were a co-location facility, and\n\n456\n00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.720\nthey rented out space\nto all sorts of people.\n\n457\n00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.320\nWell, we couldn't just walk in and\nsee our servers whenever we wanted.\n\n458\n00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.760\nWe had to call in advance, schedule\na time, and say, we're sending these two\n\n459\n00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:45.200\nrepresentatives Tuesday at 10 AM to come\nand look at the data centers, right.\n\n460\n00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.620\nAnd this is their\nidentification information.\n\n461\n00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.400\nAnd when those two people\nshowed up at 10 AM,\n\n462\n00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.910\nthe security guard,\nyou had to have somebody checking you.\n\n463\n00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:56.570\nSo there'd be a security guard,\nwould look for their name on the list.\n\n464\n00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.360\nIf they weren't on the list,\nthey were turned away.\n\n465\n00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.350\nSorry, can't get in.\n\n466\n00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.350\nYou're not on the list.\n\n467\n00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.920\nIf you were a legitimate customer,\nyou'd be on this list.\n\n468\n00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.410\nYou're not on the list.\n\n469\n00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:09.600\nAnd if they were on the list, they'd say\nokay, I need to see some identification.\n\n470\n00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.750\nShow me your credentials so I know that\nyou're actually this person on the list.\n\n471\n00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.470\nSo access lists like that are old school,\nlow tech,\n\n472\n00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:18.440\na piece of paper with names on it, right?\n\n473\n00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.440\nBut it's really important to make sure\nthat only authorized personnel are getting\n\n474\n00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.330\ninto that building.\n\n475\n00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.450\nSo, access lists are almost always\ncombined with security guards.\n\n476\n00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:27.900\nSecurity guards are really important.\n\n477\n00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:33.190\nIf you have fancy biometrics and\nautomatic door locks and\n\n478\n00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.470\nall these crazy things, motion sensors.\n\n479\n00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.970\nYou might think,\nI don't need a security guard.\n\n480\n00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:42.470\nBut there's way to overcome\njust about any security device.\n\n481\n00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.820\nPeople come up with all\nsorts of creative things.\n\n482\n00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.360\nAnd so\nwe need to have somebody on the ground.\n\n483\n00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.760\nWe need to have feet on the ground,\na person who is just walking around and\n\n484\n00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.670\nchecking things out.\n\n485\n00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:56.160\nI'll never forget one of the first times\nI recognized how important security\n\n486\n00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.120\nofficers were.\n\n487\n00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.600\nI worked in a data center\nthat was underground.\n\n488\n00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:06.850\nWhat are the odds of some random outsider\ngetting into an underground data center?\n\n489\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:08.930\nIt's pretty unlikely, right.\n\n490\n00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.930\nBut I got a call at 3 AM one day,\n\n491\n00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:16.000\nfrom the security officer that was on\nsite that they had done a security check,\n\n492\n00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.690\nand it wasn't a person that had broken in,\nor anything like what I was thinking.\n\n493\n00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.700\nIt was that one of the air\nconditioning units had failed and\n\n494\n00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.670\nthe temperature was starting\nto rise in the server room.\n\n495\n00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:29.690\nNow that's the key part there as he told\nme the temperature was starting to rise.\n\n496\n00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:33.116\nHe was able to notify me about that\ntemperature cuz he was there and\n\n497\n00:22:33.116 --> 00:22:35.919\nit hadn't gotten warm enough\nto set off an alarm, but\n\n498\n00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:39.868\nit had gotten warm enough that he noticed,\nand was able to call and tell me.\n\n499\n00:22:39.868 --> 00:22:43.434\nAnd I was able to mobilize it, and\nget the repair technicians out there,\n\n500\n00:22:43.434 --> 00:22:45.832\nto get the alternate AC units up and\nrunning, and\n\n501\n00:22:45.832 --> 00:22:49.670\ntake care of that before an alarm even\nwent off, we were able to resolve that.\n\n502\n00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.290\nZero down time,\nfull maintenance performed, and\n\n503\n00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:55.470\neverything ran smooth because\nsomebody was there watching.\n\n504\n00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.700\nNow our automated systems would've\nkicked in eventually when\n\n505\n00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.080\nthings hit the danger mark, right?\n\n506\n00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:05.050\nBut that would've given me less\ntime to resolve the problem.\n\n507\n00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.210\nSo having a person on\nthe ground is really helpful.\n\n508\n00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:12.680\n&gt;&gt; So Don, would you say that one of the\nmain benefits of a security guard is just\n\n509\n00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.170\nthat you have some kinda reactionary\n\n510\n00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:18.290\nmeasure that can be implemented whether\nthere's alarm, whether there's something.\n\n511\n00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:21.800\nHey, I seen somebody that looked\na little suspicious in the back lot or\n\n512\n00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.700\nsomething but even to your own\nenvironmental system just to have\n\n513\n00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.840\nsomebody that's there and\nthey can react to an alarm or\n\n514\n00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.720\na situation in real time\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n515\n00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:34.030\nabsolutely and they don't even have to be\nan IT person, like a heavy tech person.\n\n516\n00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.420\nIt's really the physical side, there's so\n\n517\n00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.160\nmany vulnerabilities on the physical side\nthat if you've got somebody prowling\n\n518\n00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.540\naround the outside of the building\nyou need to be aware of that.\n\n519\n00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.950\nThat's something that\na security officer can perform,\n\n520\n00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:47.800\nnow you might have somebody who's cross\ntrained where they are technical and\n\n521\n00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.470\nable to do physical security.\n\n522\n00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:54.150\nBut usually we separate those out\nbecause the hours are pretty tough.\n\n523\n00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:55.320\nAnd people get distracted.\n\n524\n00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.570\nIf you're an IT guy you're\nmonitoring servers,\n\n525\n00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:00.440\nyou might not be paying attention\nto the video cameras and stuff.\n\n526\n00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:04.587\nSo it's better to have dedicated personnel\nthat's handling that and you'll have to do\n\n527\n00:24:04.587 --> 00:24:08.524\nshift rotations to make sure you get 24\nhour coverage, and all the other things.\n\n528\n00:24:08.524 --> 00:24:11.516\nBut you can't You can't\noverstate important it is to\n\n529\n00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:14.720\nhave a physical person there\nmonitoring that security.\n\n530\n00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:19.600\nAll right continue to physical,\nkeys and locks.\n\n531\n00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.880\nKeys and locks are a traditional\nways of locking systems and\n\n532\n00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.650\nprotecting, and\nkeeping unauthorized people out.\n\n533\n00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:29.031\nWe have physical locks on our building\ndoors, on our interior doors, but\n\n534\n00:24:29.031 --> 00:24:32.460\nyou also have locks on\nyour server racks well.\n\n535\n00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:35.200\nThat co-location facility I mentioned,\nthey had racks for\n\n536\n00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.820\ntons of different customers\nall laid out there.\n\n537\n00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.750\nIf I went into work on my servers what\nwould stop me from walking over and\n\n538\n00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.330\nmessing with somebody else's?\n\n539\n00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:44.020\nWell, usually the racks were locked.\n\n540\n00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.220\nI couldn't open their rack.\n\n541\n00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.990\nAnd there were cameras, it would've\nrecorded me doing it anyways, so\n\n542\n00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:49.010\nI would've got in trouble.\n\n543\n00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:52.140\nBut having the rack locked will\nstop people from being able to\n\n544\n00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.230\nget to your equipment.\n\n545\n00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:55.700\nHere, we only have our stuff.\n\n546\n00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.050\nEvery server you see in\nthe background is an ITProTV server.\n\n547\n00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:00.020\nIt's powering something that we do.\n\n548\n00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.900\nSo, we keep the room locked,\nand that's the end of it.\n\n549\n00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:07.460\nBut, there were doors with all these,\nor there are, back behind the racks.\n\n550\n00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.090\nWe don't use the doors because\nthey just get in the way.\n\n551\n00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.780\nBut if we had multiple tenants,\n\n552\n00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:15.580\nmultiple people sharing this little data\ncenter, then we would put the doors up.\n\n553\n00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.210\nWe'd put them up and\n\n554\n00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.320\nwe'd lock them to be able to make sure\nthat only we had that access, all right?\n\n555\n00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.540\nSo, having locks on the rack is one thing.\n\n556\n00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.260\nAlso having locks on your servers.\n\n557\n00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.020\nIf you have encrypted hard drives you\ndon't really care if somebody steals\n\n558\n00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.110\nthe drives.\n\n559\n00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.870\nBut if you have unencrypted hard drives\ncuz you're trying to get the best\n\n560\n00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:35.080\nperformance, somebody could take\nthe hard drives right out of the server.\n\n561\n00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.000\nAnd if they do that,\nnow they've got your data.\n\n562\n00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.660\nThey can run home and\nhook it up and gain access to it.\n\n563\n00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.600\nWell, maybe your drives aren't\naccessible from the front.\n\n564\n00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.240\nMaybe they gotta slide the server out and\nopen the case.\n\n565\n00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:50.280\nWell, most servers have a physical lock on\ntheir case so that you can't open them up.\n\n566\n00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.950\nIt's nothing a high-powered\ndrill couldn't overcome, but\n\n567\n00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:56.030\nit'll stop somebody from quickly\ngrabbing components out.\n\n568\n00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:58.860\nI've heard of that, where data centers,\nsomebody went in and\n\n569\n00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.360\nstole memory out of a server and\nthen fired it back up.\n\n570\n00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.960\nSo the server was up and\nrunning, it was just slow, and\n\n571\n00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.360\npeople didn't know why right away.\n\n572\n00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.660\nAnd it took a few days before they\nrealized it was missing memory,\n\n573\n00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:09.830\nand they were able to go back and\n\n574\n00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:12.350\ncheck the cameras and\nfind footage to show what had happened.\n\n575\n00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:14.670\nBut that type of attack could\nbe difficult to track down,\n\n576\n00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:16.030\nphysical locks can impede that.\n\n577\n00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.490\nSome systems go even further and you\nhave locks on individual components like\n\n578\n00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:24.320\nlocks on each individual hard drive to\nstop them from accidentally being removed.\n\n579\n00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.760\nIt's not as common but\nit is something that is done.\n\n580\n00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.780\nI've seen some Dell servers where\nthey would have locks that would\n\n581\n00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.188\nlock four drives or four at a time out of,\n\n582\n00:26:33.188 --> 00:26:37.240\nI think this one I remember had 16\ninstead of four individual locks.\n\n583\n00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.980\nBut vendors have kind of\nmoved away from that because\n\n584\n00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.210\npeople are a lot better about\nphysically securing their equipment.\n\n585\n00:26:43.862 --> 00:26:48.690\nAll right, the last thing that I have to\nmention, it's on the exam objectives.\n\n586\n00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.400\nI had a little picture\nof server x with doors,\n\n587\n00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.740\nwhich we can just look at real quick.\n\n588\n00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.490\nHere's an example of a bunch\nof APC server racks.\n\n589\n00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:01.350\nAnd you'll see on each handle, let's\nsee if I can zoom in that a little bit,\n\n590\n00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.770\non each handle,\nyou've got a locking mechanism.\n\n591\n00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:06.550\nSo that's what's locking it and\nholding it closed, and\n\n592\n00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:11.070\nmaking sure that people can't just\nopen the door and get in there.\n\n593\n00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:13.770\nAnd then on the individual servers,\nthere's usually locks also,\n\n594\n00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.180\nwhich we can't really see these\nthey are a little too small.\n\n595\n00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.630\nBut there'll be locks that are making sure\nthat people can't just pop a face plate\n\n596\n00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:21.790\noff and grab a hard drive out of it.\n\n597\n00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:26.770\nAll right, but now let's go super\nlow-tech and talk about safes, right?\n\n598\n00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.490\nGood, old-fashioned combination safes.\n\n599\n00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:33.440\nHard metal that you can't get\ninto with a blowtorch, safes.\n\n600\n00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:37.620\nWhat role do safes have\nin the server world?\n\n601\n00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.720\nSafes are really important and\nevery data center should have a safe,\n\n602\n00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:45.850\nusually a much larger one than this I just\nfound this picture because it was easy\n\n603\n00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.160\nto use and it looks funny.\n\n604\n00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.960\nBut, safes do play an important role even\nin today's IT world because there's some\n\n605\n00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:58.828\ndata that we need to keep protected and\nwe need to keep it offline, all right?\n\n606\n00:27:58.828 --> 00:28:03.150\nExamples, private keys,\nwhen you have private keys used for\n\n607\n00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:05.730\nencryption and you need to back up\nthose keys you don't want those\n\n608\n00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.400\nsitting on a hard drive somewhere\nwhere somebody can get access to it.\n\n609\n00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.710\nYou don't want them on a USB key laying on\nyour desk where somebody can pick it up.\n\n610\n00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:16.960\nYou want it burned to a disc and\nlocked in a vault.\n\n611\n00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.000\nYour backup tapes, you don't want them\nsitting on a shelf where somebody could\n\n612\n00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.040\ngrab them and\nrestore it to another machine.\n\n613\n00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.490\nYou want them locked up in a vault for\nphysical security,\n\n614\n00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:29.120\nas well as, what if a fire breaks out?\n\n615\n00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.070\nMost safes are fire rated to protect\nthe contents of the safe from the fire.\n\n616\n00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:35.650\nSo now your backup tapes could\nsurvive a fire in your building.\n\n617\n00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:36.910\nYou really want them off site, but\n\n618\n00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:40.470\nif you're going to keep some on site\nyou want them locked in a vault.\n\n619\n00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.560\nAny kind of password recovery keys,\n\n620\n00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:48.060\nany kind of really secret information\nlike that, backups of your\n\n621\n00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:52.750\ncertificate authorities that kind of\nstuff you want locked in a vault.\n\n622\n00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:56.550\nA vault that only the highest\nlevel people have access level to.\n\n623\n00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:59.710\nTypically it is the CIO and\nthe CSO, right?\n\n624\n00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:01.990\nYour Chief Information Officer and\nyour Chief Security Officer.\n\n625\n00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.780\nAnd, you might have a CISO,\n\n626\n00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.590\na Chief Information Security Officer\nthen that would be the person.\n\n627\n00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:10.390\nAnd, anytime something goes in or\nout of that safe, that person's involved.\n\n628\n00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:13.800\nThey go and open the safe,\nthey log what's being taken out or\n\n629\n00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.560\nthey log what's being put back in and\nthey lock the safe.\n\n630\n00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.230\nYou keep a log, a record,\nof everything that goes in and out.\n\n631\n00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.760\nA safe like that,\nis really an essential thing.\n\n632\n00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:26.030\nYour company likely already has one,\nbecause of all the financial data,\n\n633\n00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.510\nand accounting, and stuff.\n\n634\n00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:29.940\nSo you've probably already got\none that could be used, or\n\n635\n00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.560\nyou might have a dedicated one just for\nIT.\n\n636\n00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.790\nIf you're putting backups in there,\nyou probably have a dedicated one for\n\n637\n00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:37.580\nIT, cuz you're gonna need a big one,\nversus your company,\n\n638\n00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.530\nwhich probably just needs a small one for\ntheir records.\n\n639\n00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:43.100\nBut definitely,\nmake sure that you've got one.\n\n640\n00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.650\nThat's where you need to\nbe storing that stuff.\n\n641\n00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.720\nAnd it doesn't need to be hidden behind\na picture on the wall or anything.\n\n642\n00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.520\nIt can be sitting in plain sight.\n\n643\n00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.900\nBut, it just needs to exist, so you've got\na place to lock up those things that is\n\n644\n00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.780\noffline and you don't have to\nworry about hackers getting to it.\n\n645\n00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.160\nYou can even have it\nthere in the server room.\n\n646\n00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.020\nI've seen that plenty of times, where\nthe safe is right there by the servers.\n\n647\n00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.750\nSo that we remember about it.\n\n648\n00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:04.360\nAnd we remember,\nI just generated some private keys.\n\n649\n00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.960\nLet me go and move these over,\nstick them in that safe.\n\n650\n00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.346\nI can it right there, so I remember to\ndo it, but it is an important item.\n\n651\n00:30:09.346 --> 00:30:14.330\n&gt;&gt; A non-high-tech solution that,\nwe talk about high-tech gadgets and\n\n652\n00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:15.810\nnow we're going old It's cool for sure.\n\n653\n00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.920\nDon does look like we're coming to the end\nof another episode and I tell ya',\n\n654\n00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:22.610\nwe probably should wrap this one\nup because Don has pulled out\n\n655\n00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:27.150\nmore security techniques on his person\nthan any one person should ever have, so\n\n656\n00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:30.090\nwe'll probably have to bring this one\nto an end before the fallout happens.\n\n657\n00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.122\n&gt;&gt; I know,\nmy pockets aren't even empty yet.\n\n658\n00:30:32.122 --> 00:30:33.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n659\n00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.350\nSo, Don do you have any final words that\nyou might want to put in this episode when\n\n660\n00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:39.430\nit comes to physical security for\nour viewers?\n\n661\n00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:42.250\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nphysical security is often overlooked.\n\n662\n00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:46.330\nDon't be the person that does that,\nbecause there are very simple commonsense\n\n663\n00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:50.130\ntechniques that can make millions and\nmillions of dollars in IT infrastructure\n\n664\n00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:52.430\nfor security just go right out the window,\nright?\n\n665\n00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:55.950\nSo no matter how great your VPN is and\nhow great your firewall is,\n\n666\n00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.790\nphysical security is gonna be what\nbacks that up to make sure somebody\n\n667\n00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:03.360\ncan't overcome it through easy, simple\nmethods, just by physically being there.\n\n668\n00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.590\n&gt;&gt; All right Don well thank you.\n\n669\n00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.360\nWe're gonna wrap this one up\nbefore both of our hairs fall out.\n\n670\n00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.270\nThank you for you the viewer watching.\n\n671\n00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:12.450\nSigning off for\nITProTV I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n672\n00:31:12.450

00:00:12.195\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:15.351\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome back to another\ngreat episode here at ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:18.252\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\nin today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:22.885\nwe're continuing through our series\nin Server+ CompTIA's SK0-004 and\n\n7\n00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:26.221\njoining us in the studio is\nnon other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:27.305\nDon, how are you doing sir?\n\n9\n00:00:27.305 --> 00:00:30.482\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing swell, Wes,\nready to dive right back into Server + and\n\n10\n00:00:30.482 --> 00:00:34.535\nwe're gonna be tackling security, and\nspecifically, hardening servers today.\n\n11\n00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:38.620\nSo let's start off real quick with just,\nwhat that even means, right?\n\n12\n00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.730\nWhen we install a server operating system,\nwhether you do it manually, or\n\n13\n00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.920\nautomated or whatever,\nthere's a certain level of defaults and\n\n14\n00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.800\nassumptions that are being made.\n\n15\n00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.350\nIf I pop in that Windows DVD and I install\nWindows Server 2012, when it's done\n\n16\n00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.470\nit pops up in a base configuration that\nMicrosoft assumes is okay for most people.\n\n17\n00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.889\nAnd then I can add the features I need.\n\n18\n00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.730\nWhen I install Linux,\nwhether it's RedHat or Ubuntu or\n\n19\n00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.040\nwhatever, I start the install, and\nI might have choices where I can pick and\n\n20\n00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.080\nchoose between packages, but\n\n21\n00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.370\notherwise there's still some default\nassumptions being made under the hood\n\n22\n00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.270\nthat then get rolled out on that machine\nand they assume it's okay for everybody.\n\n23\n00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.070\nBut it's not always okay.\n\n24\n00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.540\nSometimes there's features and\n\n25\n00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.710\nfunctionality that's enabled on\na server that we're not gonna use.\n\n26\n00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.560\nAnd if we're not gonna use it,\nwe're not going to think about it.\n\n27\n00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.460\nAnd if we don't think about it that\nmeans that it might be configured in\n\n28\n00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.400\na nonsecure way and\nattackers can take advantage of that.\n\n29\n00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.320\nWhen you have a server, you wanna do\nwhat's called minimizing your security\n\n30\n00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.350\nfootprint, and\nyou're minimizing your attack surface.\n\n31\n00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.500\nWhen somebody attacks you,\nthey look at a server and\n\n32\n00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.780\nthey say, how can I get into that?\n\n33\n00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.080\nAnd they start looking at all\nthe different possibilities.\n\n34\n00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.810\nIt's kind of like a house.\n\n35\n00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.310\nIf you want to break into a house,\nthe front door might be locked.\n\n36\n00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.302\nIt might have some really\nbig locks on the front door.\n\n37\n00:01:52.302 --> 00:01:53.300\nYou know, like, all right well that's out.\n\n38\n00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.550\nBut let's go take a look at the windows\nover here, or the back door.\n\n39\n00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.490\nMaybe there's a screen door somewhere.\n\n40\n00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.900\nFinding alternate ways to\nget in might not be so hard.\n\n41\n00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.210\nSo they look at your server and you might\nhave a web server configure that is\n\n42\n00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.900\nrock solid,\nlocked down as best as you can.\n\n43\n00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.730\nAnd you start looking like,\nooh, he's running FTP also,\n\n44\n00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.590\nlet me take a look at that FTP server.\n\n45\n00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.500\nIt's plain text,\nit will tell me the version number and\n\n46\n00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.850\nonce I know that I can find bugs.\n\n47\n00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.170\nAnd yup, there we go, I'm in.\n\n48\n00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.690\nIf I wasn't using that FTP server\nI should have turned it off.\n\n49\n00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.000\nI should have disabled it.\n\n50\n00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.470\nAnd that is what hardening is all about.\n\n51\n00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.860\nHardening is looking at a server and\nsaying,\n\n52\n00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.890\nwhat are areas that default install\nthat don't match up with what I need?\n\n53\n00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.340\nStuff that I can turn off and\n\n54\n00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.500\nshrink the footprint of that server,\nreduce the attack surface.\n\n55\n00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.390\nSo when an attacker looks they\nsee my highly secured web server,\n\n56\n00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.380\nand they look for another way in,\nand there is no other way in.\n\n57\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.620\nIt's a web server and that's\nthe only way they can connect to it.\n\n58\n00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.190\nNow we can use firewalls to help\nprovide this functionality and\n\n59\n00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.880\nnot mess with the servers too much.\n\n60\n00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.270\nBut, if somebody manages to get through,\nor\n\n61\n00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.190\nif somebody is inside\nyour company already, now\n\n62\n00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.300\nthey would have access to the servers that\nare in a weaker state than they should be.\n\n63\n00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.040\nSo regardless of whether\nyou have firewalls or\n\n64\n00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.480\nnot you should still harden your servers.\n\n65\n00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.330\nAnd it does vary from operating\nsystem to operating system, and\n\n66\n00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.010\nit varies based on the application\nyou're running, but there's a few\n\n67\n00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.550\nbasic steps that are kind of generic that\nreally apply to just about everything.\n\n68\n00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.790\nSo let me run through the common steps,\nand\n\n69\n00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.150\nthen I'll show you some better examples\nthat are a little more specific.\n\n70\n00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.130\nFirst off, you need to look for\n\n71\n00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.880\nany services that are running\nthat you don't need.\n\n72\n00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.810\nIf you're setting up a web server,\ndo you need FTP?\n\n73\n00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.810\nDo you need a database server?\n\n74\n00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.220\nWhat are these other services that\nmight be installed by default that\n\n75\n00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.480\nyou can turn off?\n\n76\n00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.990\nNow in the Linux world, almost all Linux\ndistributions have sendmail installed and\n\n77\n00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.200\nenabled by default, because they use it to\nsend little email alerts for the system.\n\n78\n00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.340\nWell, if you're bringing up a web server,\nyou don't need that stuff.\n\n79\n00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.180\nAnd so you can turn it off.\n\n80\n00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.330\nYou can stop those services.\n\n81\n00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.590\nOr you can uninstall them,\nin some cases you can remove it.\n\n82\n00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.290\nSometimes you can't remove them, so\njust disabling it has to be enough.\n\n83\n00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.280\nSame thing goes for Windows.\n\n84\n00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.570\nThere's a lot of services in\nthere that you may not be using.\n\n85\n00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.710\nAnd you can turn those off too and\nshrink the footprint.\n\n86\n00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.310\nUnneeded ports, that's another one.\n\n87\n00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.160\nIf I can't turn the service off,\nI can at least block the port.\n\n88\n00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.030\nI've probably got a physical firewall.\n\n89\n00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.670\nI definitely have a software firewall.\n\n90\n00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.230\nEvery operating system has\na software firewall these days.\n\n91\n00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.750\nIn Linux, it might be firewalld,\nor Iptables.\n\n92\n00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.040\nYeah, in BSD you might have PF,\nthe packet filter.\n\n93\n00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.690\nIn Windows, you have the Windows Firewall.\n\n94\n00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.610\nEasy enough to go in there and configure\nthose to say, allow this port through,\n\n95\n00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.270\nblock these other ports\ncuz I'm not using them.\n\n96\n00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.980\nAnd usually we're focused\non traffic coming in.\n\n97\n00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.530\nBut you can address traffic going out,\nalso.\n\n98\n00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.320\nIf I'm a web server,\n\n99\n00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.680\nI should be responding to people with\na source port of 80, not with other ports.\n\n100\n00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.160\nBut you have to be careful\nwith outbound traffic,\n\n101\n00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.420\ncuz you need to be able to do your\nupdates and other communications, too.\n\n102\n00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.019\nSo you've really got to pay\nattention to all those settings.\n\n103\n00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.080\nDefault usernames and passwords.\n\n104\n00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.790\nMost operating systems\nhave a default username.\n\n105\n00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.400\nIn Windows,\nyou have an account called administrator.\n\n106\n00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.440\nIn Linux, you have an account called root.\n\n107\n00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.670\nThe attackers know that.\n\n108\n00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.680\nSo you should either change that\nuser's name, or disable the user.\n\n109\n00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.090\nIn Windows, it's really easy to rename the\nadministrator account, or to disable it.\n\n110\n00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.970\nDone.\n\n111\n00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.280\nIn Linux, you actually can't\nmess with the root account.\n\n112\n00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.640\nIt has to stay that way, you can't\nchange its name and you can't delete it.\n\n113\n00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.160\nBut what you can do is you can change SSH\n\n114\n00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.610\nto not allow connections that\nare authenticated as root.\n\n115\n00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.770\nAnd now, somebody can't remotely\ncreate a shell as the root user.\n\n116\n00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.560\nSo you can stop remote\naccess under that account.\n\n117\n00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.340\nAn attack would have to physically get to\nthe machine to exploit it using the root\n\n118\n00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.040\naccount at that point.\n\n119\n00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.230\nSo, there's steps you\ncan take to secure it.\n\n120\n00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.289\nHost-based Firewalls.\n\n121\n00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.810\nYour system has a Host-based Firewall,\nthey all do.\n\n122\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.860\nIt might not be good.\n\n123\n00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.070\nYou might not like it.\n\n124\n00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.730\nSo, if you don't want to use\nit you can turn it off and\n\n125\n00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:40.980\nput a different one in place.\n\n126\n00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.740\nRight?\nThere is plenty of them out there.\n\n127\n00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.730\nBut if you have Windows,\nit's got Windows Firewall.\n\n128\n00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.076\nIf you have Linux,\nthat whole ton of them from Linux.\n\n129\n00:05:47.076 --> 00:05:49.470\nBut Iptables, and\nfirewalld are the two most common.\n\n130\n00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.790\nThey all work great.\n\n131\n00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:51.550\nConfigure them.\n\n132\n00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.195\nUse them, right?\n\n133\n00:05:52.195 --> 00:05:53.738\nTake advantage of those software firewall.\n\n134\n00:05:53.738 --> 00:05:56.310\nDon't assume that because you have\na physical firewall that's good enough.\n\n135\n00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.400\nBecause that's not going to protect\nyou from people inside the network.\n\n136\n00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.500\nAnd if somebody breaks into one server,\nthey can then leapfrog from that\n\n137\n00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.490\nserver to get to all of your\nother ones behind the firewall.\n\n138\n00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.729\nAnd now, you're weakened.\n\n139\n00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.900\nInstalling antivirus.\n\n140\n00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.360\nNow this is one of those where there's\na little bit of contention, right?\n\n141\n00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.410\nIn the Windows world,\nwe just do it out of hand.\n\n142\n00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.140\nWe were like, all right, well,\ninstall the antivirus, great.\n\n143\n00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.160\nMicrosoft Windows does\ninclude Windows Defender now.\n\n144\n00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.910\nWindows Defender has got a mediocre\ntrack record for stopping threats.\n\n145\n00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.150\nSo you might have third\nparty software you load.\n\n146\n00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.980\nThings like Symantec Endpoint Security,\nor Sophos Anitvirus, or\n\n147\n00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.620\nwhatever to protect your system.\n\n148\n00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.775\nLot of times they have their own\nfirewall built-in as well as\n\n149\n00:06:33.775 --> 00:06:35.480\nanti-malware, you can do that.\n\n150\n00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.640\nIn the Linux world,\na lot of people don't deploy anti-virus.\n\n151\n00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.145\nAnd, there are a lot of compromised\nLinux servers out there.\n\n152\n00:06:44.145 --> 00:06:46.995\nAnd it's not that the problem is,\npeople say,\n\n153\n00:06:46.995 --> 00:06:49.195\nthere's no viruses that affect Linux or\nmacOS.\n\n154\n00:06:49.195 --> 00:06:51.215\nThere's no viruses that affect macOS.\n\n155\n00:06:51.215 --> 00:06:52.660\nAnd to an extent, that's true.\n\n156\n00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.025\nThere's not a lot of in the wild\nactivity because of the lower user base.\n\n157\n00:06:57.025 --> 00:06:58.325\nBut there are a lot of exploits.\n\n158\n00:06:58.325 --> 00:06:59.965\nThere's a lot of vulnerabilities.\n\n159\n00:06:59.965 --> 00:07:01.975\nAnd so\nthose are things that we need to patch.\n\n160\n00:07:01.975 --> 00:07:03.755\nBecause people will\nmanually exploit those.\n\n161\n00:07:03.755 --> 00:07:07.120\nIt's like a manual virus as opposed\nto some kind of automated thing.\n\n162\n00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.730\nSo we still need to take steps.\n\n163\n00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.160\nAnd there is third party\nanti-virus software, like Sophos,\n\n164\n00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.300\nthat you can run right on a Linux or\nUnix machine.\n\n165\n00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.860\nBut there's also appliances that\ncan constantly scan your servers.\n\n166\n00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.940\nYou can have one appliance that scans\nhundreds of servers looking for\n\n167\n00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.740\nvulnerabilities and compliance.\n\n168\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.020\nSo you need to have some\nkind of solution like that.\n\n169\n00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.920\nThere are tons of compromised\nLinux servers on the Internet.\n\n170\n00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.070\nSo, just because you're running\nLinux doesn't mean you're safe.\n\n171\n00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.380\nOn the workstation side\nit's the same thing.\n\n172\n00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.030\nPatching the system, this one's\nprobably the most important one.\n\n173\n00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.570\nThat when you install an operating\nsystem it's already out of date.\n\n174\n00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.280\nRight, if you bought a DVD,\nwhen was that DVD printed?\n\n175\n00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.890\nMonths before.\n\n176\n00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.110\nIf you burned it yourself,\nyou downloaded an ISO image.\n\n177\n00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.392\nBut how often do they\nupdate those ISO images?\n\n178\n00:07:53.392 --> 00:07:54.610\nThey're already out of date.\n\n179\n00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.172\nWhen you do a fresh install your first\nthing you need to do once you get\n\n180\n00:07:58.172 --> 00:08:01.061\nthe network adapter configured\nIs do an update right?\n\n181\n00:08:01.061 --> 00:08:02.359\nPull all the updates down.\n\n182\n00:08:02.359 --> 00:08:04.958\nCuz there's so\nmany servers out there they comprise, and\n\n183\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.410\nit turns out that they just\nhadn't applied an update.\n\n184\n00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.860\nThe Heartbleed SSL vulnerability\nthat popped up two years ago,\n\n185\n00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.760\nit was a big vulnerability.\n\n186\n00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.380\nYou could steal the private keys off\nof the server that's pretty bad right.\n\n187\n00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.270\nWell, there are still servers that\nhave not been patched for it.\n\n188\n00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.080\nAll you have to do is do an update.\n\n189\n00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.480\nIf it's like a CentOS box or\nwhatever you type yum update, press Enter.\n\n190\n00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.320\nMaybe hit Y for yes.\n\n191\n00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.370\nIt's that easy to fix and\npeople haven't done it.\n\n192\n00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.390\nAnd these servers get compromised, right?\n\n193\n00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.400\nJust do the updates.\n\n194\n00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.600\nThe reason people don't do updates so\n\n195\n00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.040\nreliably is that sometimes updates\nbreak our software, don't they?\n\n196\n00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.390\nThey break things and\nthings don't work like they should.\n\n197\n00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.080\nYou're supposed to test them.\n\n198\n00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.100\nAnd if you say you know I don't\nhave the time to test them.\n\n199\n00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.150\nWell do you have time\nto fix a hacked server?\n\n200\n00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.320\nDo you have time to reach out\nto all your customers and\n\n201\n00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.990\ntell them, hey sorry guys well\nlet your data out, right?\n\n202\n00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.882\nIt's better to spend time to test\nthe updates, make sure everything's clear,\n\n203\n00:08:57.882 --> 00:08:58.500\nand push them in.\n\n204\n00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.672\nSo get the updates pushed out.\n\n205\n00:09:00.672 --> 00:09:04.684\nMany OSs now have the option to just do\nsecurity updates and not feature updates,\n\n206\n00:09:04.684 --> 00:09:08.100\nand that helps to make sure\nthings don't get broken.\n\n207\n00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.850\nRed Hat just rolled that out, CentOS is\nimplementing it too, where you can push\n\n208\n00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.239\njust the security updates instead of\nall the feature and function updates.\n\n209\n00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.080\nAnd then lastly deactivating default\naccounts I kind of already mentioned.\n\n210\n00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.130\nIf you can't rename a default\naccount you can deactivate it.\n\n211\n00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.330\nI mentioned root and administrative.\n\n212\n00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.620\nThere are a few others that\npop up like in macOS even on\n\n213\n00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.610\na server you have a guest account\nyou might want to disable.\n\n214\n00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.930\nSo there's a few different things that\nyou might want to look for there.\n\n215\n00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:39.090\nBut those are the basic steps,\nfor hardening a server.\n\n216\n00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.320\nBut it does vary from OS to OS.\n\n217\n00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.630\nSo most operating system vendors\nactually put out hardening guides.\n\n218\n00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.225\nThey call them different things, but\nit It's really at the end of the day\n\n219\n00:09:48.225 --> 00:09:50.385\na hardening guide for\ntheir operating system.\n\n220\n00:09:50.385 --> 00:09:51.693\nSo let me just show you\na few examples of that.\n\n221\n00:09:51.693 --> 00:09:57.455\nI've got VMware's pulled up here and you\nhave the VMware Security Hardening Guides.\n\n222\n00:09:57.455 --> 00:10:00.845\nAnd I'll put the link to this in the show\nnotes if you guys want to browse to it.\n\n223\n00:10:00.845 --> 00:10:05.171\nIf I deploy a VMware server a lot of\npeople don't think about hardening it.\n\n224\n00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:08.109\nHey, it's ESXi, it's a hypervisor,\nI never see it,\n\n225\n00:10:08.109 --> 00:10:11.070\nI just run my guest VMs I'll harden those.\n\n226\n00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.970\nWell, you've got to harden the host OS,\ntoo.\n\n227\n00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:13.870\nThere's features and\n\n228\n00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:18.780\nfunctionality turned on on those VMware\nservers that you may not be using.\n\n229\n00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.510\nAnd that makes the host vulnerable.\n\n230\n00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:24.920\nAnd if somebody compromises the host,\nwhat happens to all your guests?\n\n231\n00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:25.940\nThey're all compromised.\n\n232\n00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.610\nIf somebody can compromise the host they\nnow have console access to all the guests.\n\n233\n00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.620\nAnd that's about as bad a situation\nas you can get right there.\n\n234\n00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:33.915\nThey also have access to the storage,\n\n235\n00:10:33.915 --> 00:10:35.740\nthe virtual hard drives that\nare being used on those.\n\n236\n00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.860\nSo always be aware of that.\n\n237\n00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.546\nBut they've got a vSphere 6,\nvSphere 5.5 and so on.\n\n238\n00:10:41.546 --> 00:10:44.390\nSee how they've been putting these out for\na long time.\n\n239\n00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.500\nAnd they go back even further, but they\nonly list the supported versions here.\n\n240\n00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.330\nBut they've got hardening guides for\neach of these different products, and\n\n241\n00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.370\nthey've got a little blog\nyou can read if you want.\n\n242\n00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:58.270\nBut each one of these is containing\ninformation on how we can make sure that\n\n243\n00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:03.910\neverything in there is safe and configured\nin a secure manner to match what I need.\n\n244\n00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.140\nAll right, Microsoft does the same thing.\n\n245\n00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.845\nHere's Microsoft's security guide for\nHyper-V in Windows Server 2012.\n\n246\n00:11:08.845 --> 00:11:11.832\nThey have security guides for\nall sort of stuff.\n\n247\n00:11:11.832 --> 00:11:17.430\nHyper-V and IIS and so\non if you search around on their site.\n\n248\n00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:21.180\nThe Hyper-V one has information on\nhardening the host as well as roles,\n\n249\n00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.190\nprotecting the virtual machines,\nand best practices.\n\n250\n00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.960\nAnd they walk you through\neach of these different steps\n\n251\n00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.300\nto make sure that your system is\nconfigured as securely as possible.\n\n252\n00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Don, I've seen in the Windows\nservers where they baseline security\n\n253\n00:11:36.325 --> 00:11:36.910\nanalyzers.\n\n254\n00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:40.780\nThat's something that we might be using or\ntie into this as well.\n\n255\n00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a really neat utility.\n\n256\n00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.510\nAnd then some of the vendors have\nutilities like these, where they say look,\n\n257\n00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.950\nwe're putting out these hardening guides.\n\n258\n00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.800\nThese guides have all these steps for\nwhat you need to do.\n\n259\n00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.930\nCouldn't we just automate that?\n\n260\n00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.270\nIf we know the steps,\ncan't we make it easy?\n\n261\n00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:53.940\nAnd the baseline security\nanalyzer does that.\n\n262\n00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.350\nIt lets you scan servers and\n\n263\n00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.100\nsee if they're configured to\nthe best practices, right?\n\n264\n00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.000\nIf you look at chapter five\nof this hardening list,\n\n265\n00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.070\nit's Best Practices Checklist.\n\n266\n00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.420\nSo here's this checklist of all\nthe stuff that I should be doing.\n\n267\n00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:11.130\nAnd the baseline security analyzer can\nscan and see if you're doing this stuff.\n\n268\n00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.220\nAnd if you aren't, it can red flag it so\nyou know to deal with it.\n\n269\n00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.980\nAnd then, a lot of times,\nit can even remediate it.\n\n270\n00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.460\nIt can go and make the change and\nput it the way that we want.\n\n271\n00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.770\nAnd it automates that.\n\n272\n00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.650\nMicrosoft makes a tool for it.\n\n273\n00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.860\nThere's third party\ncompanies like Tenable.\n\n274\n00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.660\nTenable makes one that will reach out and\nscan multiple operating systems.\n\n275\n00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.570\nNot just Windows but Linux and\nvarious distros and so on.\n\n276\n00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.590\nSo we can automate some of the guides.\n\n277\n00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:37.990\nBut If you really wanna customize it\nto match your environment, you kind of\n\n278\n00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.000\nneed to at least read through the guides\nyourself and understand what works.\n\n279\n00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.580\nHere's Red Hat's security guide, they've\ngot a virtualization security guide\n\n280\n00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.525\nas well as a regular security guide\nthat applies to the entire system.\n\n281\n00:12:47.525 --> 00:12:50.725\nI pulled the security ones cuz I\nhad to use them the other day.\n\n282\n00:12:50.725 --> 00:12:53.215\nSo, you can go through and\nkind of read and\n\n283\n00:12:53.215 --> 00:12:55.665\nsee what they're saying on\nhow to harden all that.\n\n284\n00:12:55.665 --> 00:12:57.665\nAnd it's all posted\nright on their website,\n\n285\n00:12:57.665 --> 00:12:59.817\nthey make it all available for free.\n\n286\n00:12:59.817 --> 00:13:04.160\nAnd then the last example\nI have is from well,\n\n287\n00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.780\nreally from the NSA\nthe National Security Agency.\n\n288\n00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.610\nWhich not everybody is on\ngood terms with right now.\n\n289\n00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:14.592\nBut the NSA they put out security guides\ntoo on how to harden your environment.\n\n290\n00:13:14.592 --> 00:13:16.810\nAnd how to make sure your\ndata center is protected.\n\n291\n00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.450\nBecause while they do\na lot of crazy stuff,\n\n292\n00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.370\nthe NSA's actual job is to protect us,\nthat's kind of the point.\n\n293\n00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.560\nAnd so these guides are how\nthey're supposed to protect us.\n\n294\n00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.683\nThe part where they steal\nall your information or\n\n295\n00:13:27.683 --> 00:13:30.959\ninvasive with the inspection and\nall that, that's like a bonus, right?\n\n296\n00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:33.570\nBut this is the thing that\nthey're actually paid to do.\n\n297\n00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.190\nSo, these guides,\nthey've got great information in here.\n\n298\n00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:41.350\nAnd as you look at some of the stuff they\nhave, Security Configuration Guide for\n\n299\n00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:42.850\nBrowser Updates,\n\n300\n00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.270\nImplementing A Secure Administrator\nWorkstation Using Device Guard,\n\n301\n00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.740\nGuidelines For\nApplication Whitelisting and so on.\n\n302\n00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.330\nThis is all really good information.\n\n303\n00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.320\nAnd it's free.\n\n304\n00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.910\nYour taxpayer dollars pay for it.\n\n305\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.040\nIf you're outside of the US,\nyou get it for\n\n306\n00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.980\nfree and even if you don't trust the NSA,\nit's just a guide.\n\n307\n00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.870\nYou read through it and you take\nthe steps that you feel are appropriate.\n\n308\n00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.100\nIt is a great resource,\nespecially for the price point.\n\n309\n00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.920\nSo take advantage of that.\n\n310\n00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.360\nAll right, I'll post all these\nlinks in the show notes too so\n\n311\n00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.730\nyou guys can get to them and\nkind of see what it is.\n\n312\n00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.600\nThere's a couple of others things\nthat I just want to tackle that\n\n313\n00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.420\nmaybe go a little bit\nbeyond the exam objectives.\n\n314\n00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.330\nBut the exam, I think they really just\ncall out like one or two more things.\n\n315\n00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.820\nBut, just to show you as\nan example if I had a Linux host.\n\n316\n00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.070\nSo, I've got here, this guy.\n\n317\n00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.180\nHere's a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server.\n\n318\n00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.320\nI installed Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nversion 7 and during the install,\n\n319\n00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.550\nI chose to do Server with GUI.\n\n320\n00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.020\nThat was the option that I chose and\nit installed.\n\n321\n00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.070\nSo here it is, it's up.\n\n322\n00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.660\nI've got a server and it's got a GUI.\n\n323\n00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.010\nNow in real life land,\nI wouldn't have done a GUI,\n\n324\n00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.600\nI would have just done a base server.\n\n325\n00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.230\nBut I did a GUI because it\nlooks prettier on the show and\n\n326\n00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:48.610\nI can zoom the font in a lot better.\n\n327\n00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.180\nThat's really what's important.\n\n328\n00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:55.033\nNow, when it installed it, it installed\nit with a default configuration that\n\n329\n00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:59.752\nthe guys at Red Hat felt was the most\nacceptable for the most people, right?\n\n330\n00:14:59.752 --> 00:15:01.590\nThe common denominator that's out there.\n\n331\n00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.640\nSo that might be great, but\n\n332\n00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.820\nit might be running things\nthat I don't want it to run.\n\n333\n00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.040\nNow how can I figure\nout what it's running?\n\n334\n00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:08.960\nThere's a few things.\n\n335\n00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.310\nWe can take a port scanner like\nan NMAP and I can scan the server and\n\n336\n00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:14.980\nsee what ports are open.\n\n337\n00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.670\nOr you can even use netstat.\n\n338\n00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:20.920\nNetstat is a command line utility\nthat if we run netstat on the system\n\n339\n00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.520\nit'll show us all the ports\nthat we're listening on.\n\n340\n00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.730\nAnd some of these are gonna\nbe outbound connections.\n\n341\n00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.750\nSo I really need to get up\nhere towards the top, here.\n\n342\n00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.730\nAnd here's where I can see\nthe ones I'm listening on.\n\n343\n00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.260\nI should have grabbed that for\nthe word listen.\n\n344\n00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:38.880\nWhen I listen on a port, these are ports\nthat people can connect to me on.\n\n345\n00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.270\nAnd if I look, I've got 139.\n\n346\n00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.460\nWhat is 139?\n\n347\n00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.341\nWell, that's Samba, SMB.\n\n348\n00:15:44.341 --> 00:15:47.340\nIt's for file share,\nsharing files with a Windows system.\n\n349\n00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.070\nAm I sharing files with a Windows system?\n\n350\n00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.370\nMaybe it's a web server.\n\n351\n00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.509\nI'm not using that.\n\n352\n00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:55.289\nSo that's a hint that I'm running\nsomething that I don't need and\n\n353\n00:15:55.289 --> 00:15:56.443\nI can turn that off.\n\n354\n00:15:56.443 --> 00:15:58.595\n111, I don't know what 111 is.\n\n355\n00:15:58.595 --> 00:16:00.062\nDo you know what 111 is?\n\n356\n00:16:00.062 --> 00:16:02.447\nNo, I don't got a clue\n&gt;&gt; I have no clue.\n\n357\n00:16:02.447 --> 00:16:03.799\nThat's when we need to research, right?\n\n358\n00:16:03.799 --> 00:16:04.358\nI need to look it up.\n\n359\n00:16:04.358 --> 00:16:07.167\nWhat the heck is using port 11 and\nwhy am I is listening on it?\n\n360\n00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:09.500\nI've got port 10000, that's webmin.\n\n361\n00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.157\nThat's the little web interface that\nI'm running and we got a couple others.\n\n362\n00:16:13.157 --> 00:16:15.200\n53, right, that's DNS.\n\n363\n00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.759\nApparently I'm in DNS server.\n\n364\n00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:19.470\nI didn't think I was but\napparently I am, right?\n\n365\n00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.030\nSo maybe I don't need that.\n\n366\n00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:25.865\nAs you look down the list, you'll find\nthose type of things, port 25 SMTP,\n\n367\n00:16:25.865 --> 00:16:26.834\nport 22 SSH.\n\n368\n00:16:26.834 --> 00:16:30.070\nI need to look at these and\ndetermine whether I need them or not.\n\n369\n00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.000\nIf I don't know what 111 is,\nI need to find out.\n\n370\n00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.550\nAnd if I don't find out,\nat a minimum I can go into firewall d and\n\n371\n00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.460\nI can block that port.\n\n372\n00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.460\nIt's probably being blocked already.\n\n373\n00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.390\nBut I can block it and\nsee if anything breaks.\n\n374\n00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.280\nThen, [LAUGH] if something does,\nnow I know what it was.\n\n375\n00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.460\nBut at a minimum,\nI can control who can get to it.\n\n376\n00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.060\nSo, that's one way to spot it.\n\n377\n00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.700\nAn easier way is to look at your services.\n\n378\n00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:57.560\nIf I were on a sys v system,\nI would run service --status-all, and\n\n379\n00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.070\nit would give me a list of all\nthe services that I was running.\n\n380\n00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.900\nAnd I could see which ones I\nneeded to stop that I didn't need.\n\n381\n00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.687\nBut I'm on system d system, and so\nthe command's a little different.\n\n382\n00:17:06.687 --> 00:17:09.010\nAnd I need to sudo it because\nI'm not administrator.\n\n383\n00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:14.700\nSo I'm gonna sudo this, and\nI'm gonna say system ctl status and\n\n384\n00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.080\nthat's gonna list all of the units.\n\n385\n00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.050\nThe services and endpoints and stuff that\nI have in system d, it's way too much.\n\n386\n00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:26.289\nSo I'm gonna filter that with\na little grep and I'm gonna look for\n\n387\n00:17:26.289 --> 00:17:28.560\nanything that ends in .service.\n\n388\n00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.715\nRight, so anything that ends in\n.service is a program that I'm running.\n\n389\n00:17:31.715 --> 00:17:35.390\nAnd it's gonna give me a list of\nall the services that I'm running.\n\n390\n00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.440\nAnd I can go down this list and\nI can say, hey,\n\n391\n00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.330\nwhat am I actually using on this system?\n\n392\n00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:41.820\nSo when we start looking at it,\n\n393\n00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.070\nsome of these are system services that I\ncan't mess with, I need to leave them be.\n\n394\n00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:49.340\nOther ones, I might be more worried about,\nhere's the WPA supplicant.\n\n395\n00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.530\nAll right,\ndo I have a wireless adapter on my server?\n\n396\n00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.650\nNo, I don't in this one.\n\n397\n00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.128\nBut here I've got the WPS applicant.\n\n398\n00:17:56.128 --> 00:17:56.978\nIt's running.\n\n399\n00:17:56.978 --> 00:17:57.712\nIt's actually there.\n\n400\n00:17:57.712 --> 00:17:59.450\nIt's waiting for\nme to plug in a wireless adapter.\n\n401\n00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:00.660\nI'm never going to.\n\n402\n00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.710\nSo it's safe for me to turn that one off.\n\n403\n00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.730\nUpower, if I'm connected to a UPS and\ndoing the data reporting,\n\n404\n00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.680\nwhich a lot of times we aren't and\nso I might not need that.\n\n405\n00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.220\nWhat else do we have in here?\n\n406\n00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.700\nLib vert d.\n\n407\n00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:18.039\nIf I'm running a virtualization server,\nI'm not, I can turn that one off.\n\n408\n00:18:18.039 --> 00:18:20.940\nWe're seeing a whole list of\nthings that we can turn off here.\n\n409\n00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.459\nWebmin and HTTPBD, I need those,\nthat's how I'm managing this one.\n\n410\n00:18:24.459 --> 00:18:26.934\nThere's SMB, I don't need SMB.\n\n411\n00:18:26.934 --> 00:18:28.790\nSo I wanna get rid of that one,\nI wanna turn it off.\n\n412\n00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.010\nSo you identify the ones\nthat you don't need, right?\n\n413\n00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:34.020\nI see even more, postfix,\nI'm not running a mail server.\n\n414\n00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.928\nCups, I'm not printing off of this thing.\n\n415\n00:18:35.928 --> 00:18:38.792\nEach of these are different ones that\nif you've memorized the services,\n\n416\n00:18:38.792 --> 00:18:39.770\nit's easy to spot them.\n\n417\n00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.246\nIf you haven't memorized them,\nthat's where the hardening guides come in.\n\n418\n00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:44.610\nCuz they help you to identify\nwhat all these services are.\n\n419\n00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.298\nAnd so now I can come in and I can say,\n\n420\n00:18:47.298 --> 00:18:51.000\nlike systemctl stop smb.service,\nall right?\n\n421\n00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.380\nSo I'm gonna stop that service.\n\n422\n00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.890\nI forgot to sudo it.\n\n423\n00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:54.798\nThere we go.\n\n424\n00:18:54.798 --> 00:18:56.130\nSo I'm gonna stop that service.\n\n425\n00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.296\nI should've done it with a sudo.\n\n426\n00:18:58.296 --> 00:19:03.130\nAnd then if I just stop it, when I reboot\nthe server, it's gonna start again, right?\n\n427\n00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:09.048\nSo I need to come in and\nsay systemctl disable smb.service.\n\n428\n00:19:09.048 --> 00:19:11.948\nAnd now it's gonna remove it from\nsystem d and when my system reboots,\n\n429\n00:19:11.948 --> 00:19:13.830\nI'm not running SMB anymore.\n\n430\n00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.280\nI just reduced my attack surface.\n\n431\n00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.720\nIf I'm not using SMB,\nI'm not gonna think about it.\n\n432\n00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.340\nI'm not gonna spend time securing it.\n\n433\n00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.720\nIt's gonna be in its\ndefault configuration, and\n\n434\n00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.710\nthe attackers know\nthe default configuration.\n\n435\n00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:28.160\nAnd if there's a weakness anywhere in\nthere, they'll already know it, and\n\n436\n00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.200\nI'm vulnerable.\n\n437\n00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.160\nAnd here I am with a server that\nI was setting up to do NFS, or\n\n438\n00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.780\nsomething completely different, and\nI was vulnerable that whole time.\n\n439\n00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.200\nSo that's some of the stuff that we\ncan do to help to secure the systems.\n\n440\n00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:44.060\nOther things we can do,\npatching our applications, right?\n\n441\n00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.060\nWe know we have operating system updates.\n\n442\n00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.490\nWe have application updates also.\n\n443\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:51.586\nAnd on a system like this, we'll have yum,\n\n444\n00:19:51.586 --> 00:19:58.180\nwhich updates most of my applications\nas well as my system too.\n\n445\n00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.030\nSo it's kind of doing all of them.\n\n446\n00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:04.470\nOther systems like Windows, you have\nto update the applications separately.\n\n447\n00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.787\nAlmost, they're Microsoft applications,\nbut\n\n448\n00:20:05.787 --> 00:20:07.370\nnormally you have to\nupdate them separately.\n\n449\n00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.650\nSo you have to do two\ndifferent sets of updates.\n\n450\n00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:10.835\nSometimes it's easy, sometimes it's hard.\n\n451\n00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:14.069\nBut we need to make sure we update our\napplications too cuz they're just as\n\n452\n00:20:14.069 --> 00:20:17.320\nvulnerable, if not more, than what's\nin our actual operating system.\n\n453\n00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.245\nOther things, I mentioned antivirus,\n\n454\n00:20:22.245 --> 00:20:25.580\nanti-malware gets grouped\ninto that same thing.\n\n455\n00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.165\nAnd in the objectives they call it HIDS,\nwhich is HIDS,\n\n456\n00:20:29.165 --> 00:20:32.810\nhost-based intrusion detection software.\n\n457\n00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:37.430\nAnd really, antivirus is host-based\nintrusion detection software.\n\n458\n00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:40.480\nIt detects when a virus is\ntrying to do activities.\n\n459\n00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.230\nBut intrusion usually implies we're\nalso paying attention to the behavior of\n\n460\n00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:45.005\nconnections.\n\n461\n00:20:45.005 --> 00:20:47.125\nThese might be regular\nusers connecting and\n\n462\n00:20:47.125 --> 00:20:49.660\nthey're doing things\nthat aren't quite normal.\n\n463\n00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.480\nAnd so there is software like\nanti-malware that can do that and\n\n464\n00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.550\nusually we combine them all\ntogether in one product.\n\n465\n00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.010\nSo when you have endpoint security,\nit normally includes all those.\n\n466\n00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.415\nYou can deploy that on your system.\n\n467\n00:20:59.415 --> 00:21:00.850\nThere's many different\ncompanies that make it.\n\n468\n00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:04.754\nThere's even free solutions\nthat are out there.\n\n469\n00:21:04.754 --> 00:21:07.470\nLet's see, what else do I wanna mention?\n\n470\n00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:10.680\nI think I've kind of covered it\non the operating system side.\n\n471\n00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.312\nDon't forget to harden your hardware also.\n\n472\n00:21:14.312 --> 00:21:15.166\nI know that sounds silly.\n\n473\n00:21:15.166 --> 00:21:16.872\nLike, hey, it's hardware,\nit's already hard.\n\n474\n00:21:16.872 --> 00:21:21.116\nBut we need to harden that with\nhardware you have firmware.\n\n475\n00:21:21.116 --> 00:21:22.253\nThere's your BIOS.\n\n476\n00:21:22.253 --> 00:21:26.040\nThere's the other firmware for all of the\ndifferent subsystems in your equipment.\n\n477\n00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.880\nThey get updates too and\nthey need to be updated.\n\n478\n00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.530\nAnd they have security settings.\n\n479\n00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:31.730\nFor example, BIOS.\n\n480\n00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.090\nIf somebody physically gets to your\nserver, they could boot it and\n\n481\n00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:35.980\ngo into the BIOS and\nstart changing things.\n\n482\n00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.080\nSo do you have a BIOS password set on it?\n\n483\n00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.990\nI know most of us think BIOS passwords are\nsilly because you can reset them if you\n\n484\n00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.700\nhave access to the motherboard,\nso it doesn't really protect you.\n\n485\n00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.984\nWell, most servers have a lock on\nthem to stop them from being opened.\n\n486\n00:21:47.984 --> 00:21:50.830\nSo now somebody would have to have\nphysical access to the server.\n\n487\n00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.795\nAnd they'd have to be able to\ntake the server out of the rack,\n\n488\n00:21:53.795 --> 00:21:57.769\nbreak the lock, open it, and do all this\nextra stuff that's gonna take longer.\n\n489\n00:21:57.769 --> 00:22:00.510\nAnd hopefully,\nwe have time to catch them in the act.\n\n490\n00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:05.520\nBut if they can gain access\nto an IP KVM remotely,\n\n491\n00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.165\nnow they can reboot the server even\nthough they're in a different country.\n\n492\n00:22:09.165 --> 00:22:11.559\nAnd they could go into BIOS and\nthey could start doing things.\n\n493\n00:22:11.559 --> 00:22:13.279\nHaving a BIOS password\nwould help there and\n\n494\n00:22:13.279 --> 00:22:15.405\nthey wouldn't be able to reset it, right?\n\n495\n00:22:15.405 --> 00:22:16.915\nSo technologies like that.\n\n496\n00:22:16.915 --> 00:22:20.917\nEncryption passwords, when you do full\ndisk encryption and you reboot a server,\n\n497\n00:22:20.917 --> 00:22:23.828\nit's typically going to prompt for\nwhat that password is.\n\n498\n00:22:23.828 --> 00:22:26.173\nThat's all about hardening our hardware,\n\n499\n00:22:26.173 --> 00:22:28.650\nmaking sure that it's\nas secure as possible.\n\n500\n00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.840\nSo definitely don't forget that.\n\n501\n00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.970\nOther things that you might wanna mess\nwith, the boot order on a system.\n\n502\n00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.990\nWhen we boot a system up,\nit'll normally try to boot from USB or\n\n503\n00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:42.410\nboot from removable media like CD first\nand then boot from the hard drives.\n\n504\n00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:44.310\nAn attacker can take advantage of that.\n\n505\n00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.410\nAnd they can boot it off of their own\nmedia, and then start to try and gain\n\n506\n00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:51.980\naccess to the hard drives, or use your\nfiber HBAs to then gain access to the SAN.\n\n507\n00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.770\nThat would be bad.\n\n508\n00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:57.930\nIf you make it where the boot order forces\nit to boot from the hard drives first,\n\n509\n00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:58.820\nnow they can't do that.\n\n510\n00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.120\nThey can't boot from a USB key or\na CD, right?\n\n511\n00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:06.232\nSo, putting that in a BIOS, locking the\nBIOS down, stopping people from being able\n\n512\n00:23:06.232 --> 00:23:08.710\nto get it, that helps to\nsecure that system even more.\n\n513\n00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.021\nWe also have things like chassis locks,\n\n514\n00:23:12.021 --> 00:23:14.842\nwhere I kinda mention it as\nfar as the server itself, but\n\n515\n00:23:14.842 --> 00:23:17.860\nyou can even lock it where\nthe entire server rack has a lock.\n\n516\n00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.580\nYou can't even open the rack, better yet\nget to the individual server.\n\n517\n00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.800\nThese are all part of hardening\nthe actual server hardware.\n\n518\n00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.509\n&gt;&gt; You know, Don, while you were explain\nthis, I actually took your advice and\n\n519\n00:23:28.509 --> 00:23:31.725\ndid a little bit of research on\nthe port 111 that was open there.\n\n520\n00:23:31.725 --> 00:23:34.980\nAnd turns out that is a port that\nthey recommend closing down.\n\n521\n00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.130\nIt's a port mapper.\n\n522\n00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:41.745\nAnd you could do OS fingerprinting,\nyou can do resource exhaustion,\n\n523\n00:23:41.745 --> 00:23:46.234\nso they tell you to close it\ndown if you aren't using it.\n\n524\n00:23:46.234 --> 00:23:47.076\nSo you can see right there\nwhat you were talking about.\n\n525\n00:23:47.076 --> 00:23:48.740\n&gt;&gt; Well, there we go.\n\n526\n00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.080\nYou mentioned OS fingerprinting, right?\n\n527\n00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.560\nWhen an attacker targets a system.\n\n528\n00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.180\nLet me give you the basic rundown so\nyou understand the process.\n\n529\n00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.217\nLets say I wanna hack into Wes' laptop,\nright?\n\n530\n00:23:57.217 --> 00:23:58.863\nWell, first I have to\nfind it on the network.\n\n531\n00:23:58.863 --> 00:23:59.799\nThat's not normally hard.\n\n532\n00:23:59.799 --> 00:24:02.301\nIf we're talking about a server,\nit's got a DNS name.\n\n533\n00:24:02.301 --> 00:24:07.668\nAnd so I want to attack that DNS,\nthat system.\n\n534\n00:24:07.668 --> 00:24:11.740\nwww.wesslaptop.com, so\nI find it very easy.\n\n535\n00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:15.014\nThen I run a scan on it to look for\nports that are open.\n\n536\n00:24:15.014 --> 00:24:17.734\nAnd if I can find a port that's open\nI know it's running a service and\n\n537\n00:24:17.734 --> 00:24:20.190\nI can usually identify\nthe service based on the port.\n\n538\n00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:22.470\nSo if I see port 25 open I know it's mail.\n\n539\n00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:23.770\nPort 22 it's SSH.\n\n540\n00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:27.310\nPort 21 it's FTP,\nyou kind of identify based on that.\n\n541\n00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:32.072\nThe next step is to figure out what\noperating system it's running,\n\n542\n00:24:32.072 --> 00:24:33.970\nwhat software it's running, and\n\n543\n00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.870\nmore importantly what versions\nof all of that, right?\n\n544\n00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.720\nBecause if I see it's\nrunning an FTP server and\n\n545\n00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.450\nI connect to it, even if I don't log in\nyou will get a little header message.\n\n546\n00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:47.200\nIn the header message it might\nsay you're running Vsftp,\n\n547\n00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.474\nor FTPPro, or whatever, version 1.7.\n\n548\n00:24:51.474 --> 00:24:56.540\nI can just go to the website for\nvsftp and version 1.8 is out.\n\n549\n00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:58.600\nLet me check the release notes.\n\n550\n00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.910\nRight here in the release notes, fixed\nsecurity advisory, see the blah blah blah.\n\n551\n00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:06.920\nAll right, well if they fix that\nin 1.8 and Wes is running 1.7,\n\n552\n00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.229\nyou just told me how to\nbreak into that system.\n\n553\n00:25:09.229 --> 00:25:11.310\nHere's a way.\nI didn't even have to figure it out.\n\n554\n00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:14.130\nIt's already just right here,\nyou told me what to do.\n\n555\n00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:19.020\nSo by hiding that, by obscuring that,\nby making it where they can't\n\n556\n00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.720\nwhat operating system I'm running,\nwhat versions of software I'm running,\n\n557\n00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.580\nwhat ports I've opened,\nif I can do that all the better, right?\n\n558\n00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.580\nAnd so that's part of making sure\nthat our systems are secure,\n\n559\n00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:29.930\nand updated, and patched.\n\n560\n00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.870\nBecause if you're not patching,\n\n561\n00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:35.350\nthen the answer to how to hack\nyour server is already out there.\n\n562\n00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.650\nIt's already on the vendor websites.\n\n563\n00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:38.010\nIt's public knowledge.\n\n564\n00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.480\nSo it's just a matter of time\nbefore somebody uses it.\n\n565\n00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.080\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\nlot of great information.\n\n566\n00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:48.010\nI even learned today about the involuntary\nNSA bonus program for sure.\n\n567\n00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:50.010\nIt does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n568\n00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:50.590\nBut before we do,\n\n569\n00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.360\ndo you have any parting words that you\nmight like to in part to our viewers?\n\n570\n00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.390\n&gt;&gt; The only objective I didn't\nmention was disabling wake on LAN.\n\n571\n00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:59.890\nIf you have network adapters and\nyou power a server down\n\n572\n00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:03.580\nit's possible to send a Wake On Lan\nmagic bullet to wake the server back up.\n\n573\n00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.090\nSo you might have a server\nthat's turned off.\n\n574\n00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:08.300\nMaybe it wasn't secure, you haven't\nhad a chance to harden it yet so\n\n575\n00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.980\nyou shut it down and you go home.\n\n576\n00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.660\nAnd somebody sends a Wake On Lan\nmagic bullet to it.\n\n577\n00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.670\nWake On Lan doesn't do any authentication.\n\n578\n00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.480\nSo if somebody sends a message to wake\nit up, the server's going to wake up and\n\n579\n00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.840\ncome back online.\n\n580\n00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:24.240\nYou turned it off thinking it was secure,\nor more secure to have it off than on.\n\n581\n00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.780\nAnd now it's up and running and\nit's actually targeted.\n\n582\n00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.360\nSo they recommend turning\noff Wake-on-LAN on servers.\n\n583\n00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.040\nWe don't normally use Wake-on-LAN\non servers anyway, so\n\n584\n00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.000\nyou can go into your network\nadapter settings or into your BIOS,\n\n585\n00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.190\neither one, and disable that\nfunctionality and help to prevent that.\n\n586\n00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:41.700\nThat's one more thing that\nyou might need to disable.\n\n587\n00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:45.485\n&gt;&gt; All right Don as always we appreciate\nhaving you here in the studios with us and\n\n588\n00:26:45.485 --> 00:26:47.490\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n589\n00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:50.082\nSigning up for\nITProTV I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n590\n00:26:50.082 --> 00:26:51.010\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don

for\n\n3\n00:00:15.918 --> 00:00:18.976\njoining us, I'm your host Wes Bryan and\nin today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:22.500\nwe're continuing through our series and\ncome see us server plus.\n\n5\n00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.230\nJoining us in the studios is\nnone other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.320\nDon, how are you doing, sir?\n\n7\n00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.270\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n8\n00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.310\nReady to continue on with our Server+\nadventure and in this episode,\n\n9\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.220\nwe're going to be talking about network\nsecurity because the easiest way\n\n10\n00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.130\nto make sure our servers are secure is\nto ask somebody else to do it for us.\n\n11\n00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.030\nRight?\nAnd so if you're a sys admin,\n\n12\n00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.470\nyou don't want to deal with\nthe whole security thing\n\n13\n00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.690\nMake the network guys do it.\n\n14\n00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.635\nReach over their admin team and say hey,\ncan you guys, you know, secure my stuff.\n\n15\n00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:52.180\n[LAUGH] And a lot of times they can.\n\n16\n00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.270\nIn a perfect world, you're both doing it.\n\n17\n00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.220\nRight.\nWhere you're taking all sorts of security\n\n18\n00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.170\nprecautions on the server side.\n\n19\n00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.290\nMeanwhile, the net admins are taking\nprecautions on the network side.\n\n20\n00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.730\nThe problem is,\nthe network guys can't solve every issue.\n\n21\n00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.940\nBecause your server provides\na service thus the name and\n\n22\n00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.380\npeople need to be able to\nconnect to that service.\n\n23\n00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.890\nAnd if we block that off\nthen that's easy right?\n\n24\n00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.300\nIf you want to truly secure your\nserver just unplug the network cable.\n\n25\n00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.120\nBut then your server can't do\nthe job that it needs to do.\n\n26\n00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.240\nSo the network guys can implement\nas much security as they can and\n\n27\n00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.360\nstill allow you to provide your service.\n\n28\n00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.550\nAnd then it's up to you to do the rest and\n\n29\n00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.610\nmake sure that you've secured\nthe services on that server.\n\n30\n00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.460\nSo let's talk about what\nthe network guys can do for you and\n\n31\n00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.250\nwhat they can't do,\nwhat are our limitations.\n\n32\n00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.990\nThe first thing I wanna talk\nabout are firewalls and\n\n33\n00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.950\nwhat firewalls do is they allow us to\nfilter traffic Between two networks,\n\n34\n00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.930\nand I used to always say and\nbetween between the internet and\n\n35\n00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.420\nour network, but\nyou can use firewalls internally too.\n\n36\n00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.380\nAnd I've done that numerous times where\nyou had research and development networks\n\n37\n00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.850\nthat you didn't want to have access\nto your production networks.\n\n38\n00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.370\nAnd so you could use an internal\nfirewall to filter that access.\n\n39\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.410\nBut the most common solution is to\nuse it between your network And\n\n40\n00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.540\nthe Internet, when you connect to\nthe Internet it's the wild west out there.\n\n41\n00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.060\nYou've got the entire world.\n\n42\n00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.930\nAnd the hackers and the bad guys,\na lot of them are out there.\n\n43\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.560\nNow just as many attacks happen\nfrom the inside as the outside but\n\n44\n00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.490\nbecause the outsiders have to pass\nthrough your Internet connection,\n\n45\n00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.940\nit gives you a single point\nwhere you can easily catch and\n\n46\n00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.400\nstop that traffic which means\nwe really need to address that.\n\n47\n00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.860\nNow Don, when it comes to firewalls,\nis the firewalls that I have, let's say on\n\n48\n00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.130\nmy Windows machine, is that gonna be the\nsame type of firewall that you're gonna\n\n49\n00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.840\ndeploy like you were mentioning, between\nyour internal LAN and the internet?\n\n50\n00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.060\nOr are they gonna be\ndifferent types of firewalls?\n\n51\n00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.670\n&gt;&gt; They're actually pretty\nsimilar in how they work.\n\n52\n00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.710\nWhat a firewall does, it just looks at\npackets, and it lets some of them through\n\n53\n00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.930\nand it doesn't let others\nthrough based on a set of rules.\n\n54\n00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.130\nThat's how they work.\n\n55\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.290\nAnd so\nfrom that perspective they're the same.\n\n56\n00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.590\nBut what Wes is talking about are host\nbased firewalls versus network firewalls.\n\n57\n00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.270\nAnd a host based firewall is software\nthat runs on your server like IP tables,\n\n58\n00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.880\nFirewall D, Windows Firewall.\n\n59\n00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.530\nA network firewall is an appliance that's\non your network that sits in between\n\n60\n00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.620\ntwo different networks.\n\n61\n00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.770\nThat'll be something like a Cisco ASA,\na Juniper SSG, PF Sense,\n\n62\n00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.170\nwhatever it is you use, CheckPoint\nFirewall One, those kind of things.\n\n63\n00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.030\nSonic Wall, the list goes on and on.\n\n64\n00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.440\nThe main difference is that a firewall\non the network, a main firewall,\n\n65\n00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.030\ncan stop an attack before it\ngets to your server Versus\n\n66\n00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.520\na software firewall where the attack\nhas already made it to your server and\n\n67\n00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.990\nyou're trying to stop\nit at the last moment.\n\n68\n00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.890\nThe best solution is to have both, right?\n\n69\n00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.610\nSo let me show you a diagram here.\n\n70\n00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.360\nI might have a file server, and\nI want that file server protected, or\n\n71\n00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.680\neven better a web server.\n\n72\n00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.470\nI have a web server and\nI want that web server protected.\n\n73\n00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.810\nSo I can place it in a special network.\n\n74\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.070\nThese are called zones.\n\n75\n00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.290\nWhen you have a network you don't\nnormally just have one network,\n\n76\n00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.910\nyou normally divide it up in\ndifferent security zones.\n\n77\n00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.570\nYou may have high security zones and\nlow security zones.\n\n78\n00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.360\nYour LAN, your local area network,\nthat's gonna be a high security zone.\n\n79\n00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.160\nI don't want people on the internet\ngetting to my LAN that's where I have my\n\n80\n00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.980\ndomain controller, my files and so on.\n\n81\n00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.470\nBut if I have a web server,\nI want the public to get to my web server.\n\n82\n00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.030\nSo I might move that off to a DMZ,\na demilitarized zone.\n\n83\n00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.500\nThis is one where I allow people to\nget to it, but I just take care,\n\n84\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.430\nI take caution to make sure\nthat my network stays safe.\n\n85\n00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.760\nI want to make sure that if\nsomebody hacks my web server,\n\n86\n00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.040\nthat they can't just leapfrog and\njump right over into my internal servers.\n\n87\n00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.000\nThey would have to pass\nback through the firewall\n\n88\n00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.150\nwhere we've got protections in place.\n\n89\n00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.740\nNow if somebody is\nattacking my web server,\n\n90\n00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.060\nthat attack is gonna come from\nthe Internet typically, it's gonna pass\n\n91\n00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.070\nthrough the firewall on it's way down\nto the DMZ and to the web server.\n\n92\n00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.450\nAnd so if I can detect that attack\nat the firewall I can stop it\n\n93\n00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.850\nBefore it even gets to the web server.\n\n94\n00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.040\nIf I was just relying on a software\nfirewall, you know, one running on the web\n\n95\n00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.810\nserver, the attack would actually make\nit all the way to the web server.\n\n96\n00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.800\nAnd if I failed to block it,\nthen I'm now gonna get compromised, right?\n\n97\n00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.420\nIf I have both, that's even better.\n\n98\n00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.090\nI'm filtering here at\nthe hardware firewall and\n\n99\n00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.970\nagain at the software firewall.\n\n100\n00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.100\nTwo layers of defense right?\n\n101\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.880\nDefense in depth, that's what we really\nwant to have in a solution like this.\n\n102\n00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.480\nNow one of the bigger\nchallenges that we have though\n\n103\n00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.480\nis that outside attackers are easy.\n\n104\n00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.650\nCuz we know where they're coming from.\n\n105\n00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.920\nWe know they're gonna come\nacross our internet link.\n\n106\n00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.720\nBut, what about internal attackers?\n\n107\n00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.670\nWhat if you have a disgruntled employee?\n\n108\n00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.270\nOr, what if you're supporting\nthe network at a school?\n\n109\n00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.040\nEvery student is disgruntled at a school,\nright, but especially at a highschool,\n\n110\n00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.350\nwhere you've got teenagers that are just\nlearning About computers and the things\n\n111\n00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.550\nthey can do, and haven't necessarily\nlearned restraints, or legal liability,\n\n112\n00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.770\nand all that stuff yet, that you\nlearn when you get a little older.\n\n113\n00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.580\nSo they start doing things like trying to\nbreak into your servers, and poking and\n\n114\n00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.810\nprodding on the servers to\nsee what they can get at.\n\n115\n00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.190\nWell, they've got a lot more\ntime on your hands than you do.\n\n116\n00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.130\nThat's for sure.\n\n117\n00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.300\nAnd so they will find ways\nto get into those systems.\n\n118\n00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.630\nAnd so, we gotta have ways\nto stop that from happening.\n\n119\n00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.720\nOne way we can do that is by\npreventing them from running\n\n120\n00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.180\nunauthorized software on your equipment.\n\n121\n00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.810\nIf you have work computers, you shouldn't\nbe allowing users to install software.\n\n122\n00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.180\nAnd you shouldn't be allowing them to do\nactions beyond what they needed from work.\n\n123\n00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.950\nBut the way they get around that is\nthey bring their own stuff, right.\n\n124\n00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.120\nWe had this whole bring your own device,\nBYOD movement right now where people bring\n\n125\n00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.370\ntheir smart phones,\ntheir tablets, their laptops.\n\n126\n00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.050\nThey bring their own equipment in.\n\n127\n00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.000\nHow do I stop them from installing\nsoftware on their own equipment?\n\n128\n00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.150\nYou can't, you don't.\n\n129\n00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.510\nInstead, what you do is you control what\nequipment is allowed on your network.\n\n130\n00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.430\nNetwork admins can set up what's\ncalled Network Access Control, or NAC.\n\n131\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.220\nAnd what Network Access Control does is\nit allows us to restrict the machines\n\n132\n00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.670\nthat can plug in.\n\n133\n00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.480\nSo if somebody connects to\nour wireless network, or\n\n134\n00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.090\ntries to physically plug into a port,\nwe can see if they're authorized.\n\n135\n00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.620\nOn the switch we call it port security.\n\n136\n00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.740\nAnd it can look for approved MAC\naddresses on the network adapters.\n\n137\n00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.220\nIf it's an approved MAC, it allows it on.\n\n138\n00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.550\nIf it's not an approved MAC,\nit doesn't allow it on.\n\n139\n00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.360\nBut MAC addresses can be spoofed.\n\n140\n00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.830\nSo port security isn't enough.\n\n141\n00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.180\nWe can move beyond that though and\nwe can do network access control NAC.\n\n142\n00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.600\nOr we can do 802.1X, authentication.\n\n143\n00:07:18.708 --> 00:07:21.830\nNAC and 802.1X are actually, very similar.\n\n144\n00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:28.110\nWhen you plug in you have to present\na certificate that validates who you are.\n\n145\n00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.750\nAnd the switch of the wireless access\npoint will look at that certificate and\n\n146\n00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.000\ndetermine, if it's valid.\n\n147\n00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.800\nIf it's valid you're allowed to talk.\n\n148\n00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.050\nIf it's not valid you're\nnot allowed to talk.\n\n149\n00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.880\nYou cannot spoof the certificate.\n\n150\n00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.400\nYou would have to compromise\nthe private key and\n\n151\n00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.150\nif that happens you got bigger problems\nthan somebody plugging in on the network.\n\n152\n00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.210\nSo, this gives us a very\nhigh level of security.\n\n153\n00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.170\nNow you can control exactly,\nwhich devices on our the network and\n\n154\n00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.255\nno more unauthorized devices.\n\n155\n00:07:53.255 --> 00:07:55.690\n802.1 x focuses on\nthe authentication side.\n\n156\n00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.257\nKnack, does the same thing.\n\n157\n00:07:57.257 --> 00:08:01.019\nAnd then it goes one step further and\nit says all right you just validated and\n\n158\n00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:02.759\nshowed you are who you say you are.\n\n159\n00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:05.328\nBut do you have antivirus installed?\n\n160\n00:08:05.328 --> 00:08:06.472\nWhen's the last time you did an update?\n\n161\n00:08:06.472 --> 00:08:08.024\nHave you updated in the last three days?\n\n162\n00:08:08.024 --> 00:08:10.651\nHave you done your Windows updates?\n\n163\n00:08:10.651 --> 00:08:12.112\nHave you done those in\nthe last three days?\n\n164\n00:08:12.112 --> 00:08:13.190\nYou haven't?\n\n165\n00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.990\nI'm gonna isolate you on the network.\n\n166\n00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.589\nAnd if you have somebody who's not\nupdated, who's machine could potentially\n\n167\n00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:22.095\nbe infected with a virus, or whatever\nit isolates them in a quarantine zone.\n\n168\n00:08:22.095 --> 00:08:25.497\nAnd you can remediate, let them do\nupdates, let them do scans, and\n\n169\n00:08:25.497 --> 00:08:29.439\nwhen they're clean, then it transitions\nthem into the regular network, but\n\n170\n00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:32.930\notherwise, it isolates them and\nholds them off.\n\n171\n00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:34.700\nJust does the authentication.\n\n172\n00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.650\nNAC goes that step further, and\ndoes a lot more on top of that, so.\n\n173\n00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.950\nNAC is actually a product from Cisco, so\n\n174\n00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:46.150\nCisco network access control, Microsoft\nhas something similar called NAP,\n\n175\n00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.540\nright, network access-\n&gt;&gt; Protection.\n\n176\n00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.340\n&gt;&gt; Protection, thank you Wes.\n\n177\n00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.510\nSo, there's various vendors\nthat make the same thing.\n\n178\n00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.202\nAnd it actually leverages 802.1X for\n\n179\n00:08:54.202 --> 00:08:56.559\nthe authentication,\ncuz that's a consistent standard.\n\n180\n00:08:56.559 --> 00:08:59.320\nAnd then it just adds all\nthe extra features on top of that.\n\n181\n00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.050\nWhat are some of the other things that\nnetwork admin can do to help us out?\n\n182\n00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.370\nIdeally, we have firewalls for\nfiltering things.\n\n183\n00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.740\nBut in lieu of firewalls or\n\n184\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.240\nin addition to firewalls, you might have\nrouters that can also be doing filtering.\n\n185\n00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.490\nRouters support access control lists,\nACLs, and\n\n186\n00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.770\nACLs are like the poor man's firewall.\n\n187\n00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.220\nThey let you put in rules\nthat specifically block or\n\n188\n00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.890\nallow certain types of traffic.\n\n189\n00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:31.940\nThe problem with ACLs on a router is that\nan access control list is one direction.\n\n190\n00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.930\nSo, I am filtering traffic on the way\nin or filtering traffic on the way out.\n\n191\n00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.690\nThe problem is communications are two way.\n\n192\n00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.470\nI send a message to a server,\nthe server has to respond to me.\n\n193\n00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.260\nSo, anytime I close a router\nusing rules like these,\n\n194\n00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.050\nI have to add rules for\nboth directions, which gets annoying.\n\n195\n00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:53.610\nFirewalls do stateful packet inspection.\n\n196\n00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.750\nSo, when they see a communication come in,\nif it's allowed,\n\n197\n00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.530\nit assumes that I want the reply to be\nallowed also, and it takes care of that.\n\n198\n00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.380\nIt's a more bidirectional nature.\n\n199\n00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.070\nSo, you can certainly do access\ncontrol lists on a router but,\n\n200\n00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.800\nthey're not as optimal.\n\n201\n00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.090\nThe other thing is, that on a router,\nit's not really designed for\n\n202\n00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:13.010\npacket filtering,\nit's designed for packet routing.\n\n203\n00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.310\nFirewalls have hardware built into\nthem specifically designed for\n\n204\n00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.260\nfiltering, routers don't.\n\n205\n00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.500\nSo, routers do that work in\ntheir general purpose CPU,\n\n206\n00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.910\nwhich means they're slower,\nthey're not as good at it with a firewall.\n\n207\n00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.390\nBut one of the things that I do,\nI like to access control list for\n\n208\n00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.020\na router is anti-spoofing.\n\n209\n00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.230\nI know that their certain IP ranges\nshould not be getting traffic on\n\n210\n00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.580\nfrom the Internet.\n\n211\n00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.473\nI should never receive RFC1918\ntraffic from the Internet,\n\n212\n00:10:38.473 --> 00:10:42.366\ntraffic that has a source IP of 192.168,\nsomething, or\n\n213\n00:10:42.366 --> 00:10:47.516\n172.16 all the way through\n172.31.something, or 10.anything.\n\n214\n00:10:47.516 --> 00:10:53.852\nI shouldn't get traffic like that,\nI shouldn't get traffic on 127.anything or\n\n215\n00:10:53.852 --> 00:10:57.550\n0.anything 22, no, 2, what is it 240?\n\n216\n00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:01.266\nWhat is the multicast ends, it's 224, 240?\n\n217\n00:11:01.266 --> 00:11:02.012\n&gt;&gt; That's 240.\n\n218\n00:11:02.012 --> 00:11:05.784\n&gt;&gt; So 241.anything,\nI should be getting broadcasts.\n\n219\n00:11:05.784 --> 00:11:08.200\nI should be getting\nbroadcast from the Internet.\n\n220\n00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.570\nThose are all things that we\ncan filter out really easily\n\n221\n00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.410\non an access list on a router.\n\n222\n00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.620\nAnd there, it's just looking at source IP,\nwhich a router does anyway.\n\n223\n00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:17.542\nIt's a layer three device.\n\n224\n00:11:17.542 --> 00:11:20.820\nIt's gonna look at the layer three header,\nso that doesn't impact performance at all.\n\n225\n00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.780\nSo, access control on a router can be\nused to filter out cheesy traffic that we\n\n226\n00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.950\nshouldn't be getting anyway, and then the\nfirewall can do the real inspection and\n\n227\n00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.470\nthe real filtering and stuff beyond that,\nso routers can be used for this stuff.\n\n228\n00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.790\nAnother device that network admins can\nimplement for us is what you call an IDS,\n\n229\n00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.770\nan intrusion detection system.\n\n230\n00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:45.250\nAnd I've kind of mentioned this before\nit HIDS, host space intrusion detection,\n\n231\n00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:49.020\nwell, you have network based\nintrusion detection systems or NIDS.\n\n232\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.220\nNow, there's two different devices here\nthat create a little bit of confusion.\n\n233\n00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.830\nAnd I know Wes and\nI have talked about this in other shows.\n\n234\n00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:03.710\nYou have intrusion prevention systems and\nintrusion detection systems, IDS and IPS.\n\n235\n00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:07.480\nAn intrusion detection\nsystem will detect and\n\n236\n00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.659\nattack alert us, but\nnot do anything about it.\n\n237\n00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:16.340\nAn intrusion prevention system will\ndetect the attack and then stop it.\n\n238\n00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:21.070\nIt'll prevent the attack, IPS and\nIDS, they're two different things.\n\n239\n00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:26.280\nWhere the confusion comes in is that if\nyou go to whoever it is that you're buying\n\n240\n00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:33.390\nyour hardware from, Cisco or Juniper,\nthey don't sell IDS, or IPS.\n\n241\n00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.820\nThey sell one appliance that does both.\n\n242\n00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.352\nIt's one appliance that does IDS and IPS.\n\n243\n00:12:37.352 --> 00:12:40.095\nIt's essentially the same hardware,\nthe same software, the same configuration,\n\n244\n00:12:40.095 --> 00:12:41.570\nthe same everything.\n\n245\n00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.190\nThe only difference between an IDS and\n\n246\n00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.590\nan IPS is where we install it,\nwhere we put it, all right?\n\n247\n00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.940\nAn IPS, an intrusion prevention system,\nworks like this.\n\n248\n00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.840\nI have a device,\nthis green device, that's my IPS.\n\n249\n00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:59.560\nAnd I put it between the firewall and\nthe network that I'm protecting.\n\n250\n00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.295\nOkay, so here I've got two IPSs,\none between the firewall and my LAN, and\n\n251\n00:13:03.295 --> 00:13:05.566\nanother one between the firewall and\nmy DMZ.\n\n252\n00:13:05.566 --> 00:13:10.750\nI could just have one IPS and stick it\nbetween the firewall and the Internet.\n\n253\n00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.000\nBit IPSs are normally ethernet only, so\nwe don't normally stick them outside of\n\n254\n00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.830\nthe firewall, unless we happen to\nhave Metro-E or something like that.\n\n255\n00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.137\nBut it's usually gonna be on the inside.\n\n256\n00:13:19.137 --> 00:13:22.299\nSo here I've got my IPSs and\nif you look how to cabling is run,\n\n257\n00:13:22.299 --> 00:13:26.640\nthe cable from the firewall doesn't\nrun straight to the switch anymore.\n\n258\n00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.691\nThe cable from the firewall\nruns to the IPS, and\n\n259\n00:13:28.691 --> 00:13:31.059\nthe IPS is another cable that\nruns through the switch.\n\n260\n00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:36.019\nSo, that 100% of the traffic from\nthis firewall going to the switch has\n\n261\n00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:37.290\nto pass to the IPS.\n\n262\n00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:42.650\nAnd as the traffic goes through it,\nit can inspect it, look at it and\n\n263\n00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.290\ndetermine if there's\na TAC traffic in there.\n\n264\n00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:47.260\nAnd if there is, it can block it.\n\n265\n00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.340\nIt can block it, and that attack\ntraffic never makes it to the switch,\n\n266\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.700\nwhich means it never\ngets down to my servers.\n\n267\n00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.560\nThat's perfect, that's what we want.\n\n268\n00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.990\nOkay, that's what an IPS does.\n\n269\n00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.160\nAn IDS is where I take that\nexact same hardware and\n\n270\n00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.800\ninstead of putting it in line, I just\nstick it off of the switch somewhere.\n\n271\n00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.210\nSo here, I've got an IDS, that same\nhardware, plugged into the switch.\n\n272\n00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:16.510\nAnd the traffic from the firewall goes\nright to the switch and to the server.\n\n273\n00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.330\nBut on the switch,\nI configure port mirroring.\n\n274\n00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.690\nPort mirroring is where I say any traffic\non this port, copy it to this other port.\n\n275\n00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:28.770\nSo, a copy of all the traffic is set\nover to that box where it's inspected,\n\n276\n00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.448\nand there's attack traffic\nfound it can't stop it.\n\n277\n00:14:31.448 --> 00:14:35.049\nIt can't stop it, it can't stop it because\nthe traffic is already gone through,\n\n278\n00:14:35.049 --> 00:14:37.390\nit's already made it to that server.\n\n279\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.660\nBut it can detect, it can see the attack,\nand it can alert me and let me know and\n\n280\n00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.000\nnow I've got a record of it.\n\n281\n00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.410\nIt's the same hardware,\nthe same piece of equipment,\n\n282\n00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.340\nit's just where I install it\nthat makes the difference.\n\n283\n00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:53.460\nNow, the question I always get\nis if it's the same hardware and\n\n284\n00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.300\nan IPS can stop the attack,\nwhy wouldn't I do that?\n\n285\n00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.050\nThat's a no-brainer.\n\n286\n00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.918\nIt's crazy,\nwhy wouldn't I use it that way?\n\n287\n00:14:59.918 --> 00:15:03.300\nAnd there's really just one reason,\nperformance.\n\n288\n00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:10.240\nWhen we have it inline, everything that\npasses through that IPS has get inspected,\n\n289\n00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.050\nand that takes a moment.\n\n290\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.870\nNow, when I say a moment,\n\n291\n00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.650\nwe're talking about nano seconds,\nreally small window of time.\n\n292\n00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:19.400\nBut if this is voice over IP traffic,\nor streaming video, or\n\n293\n00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.820\nwhatever, it introduces a delay.\n\n294\n00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:26.210\nAnd if I'm dealing with time sensitive\ntraffic, I don't want that delay.\n\n295\n00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:31.070\nIf this is a storage network, I need my\nstorage to be as fast as possible, so\n\n296\n00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.790\nI don't want that delay.\n\n297\n00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:38.100\nAnd so, in those scenarios, an IDS is\nbetter, because I can inspect the traffic,\n\n298\n00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.950\nI'll know if there's an attack,\nbut I don't impact performance.\n\n299\n00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.876\nNow, an IDS,\nit can't stop the initial attack, but\n\n300\n00:15:45.876 --> 00:15:48.240\nit can stop it from continuing.\n\n301\n00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.229\nYou can have scripts that are written\non it, so if it sees an attack on it,\n\n302\n00:15:51.229 --> 00:15:54.561\nit can reach out to the switch and tell\nthe switch, hey, block out this traffic,\n\n303\n00:15:54.561 --> 00:15:57.907\nor reach out the the firewall, hey, create\na firewall rule to block that stuff.\n\n304\n00:15:57.907 --> 00:16:01.536\nThen it stops it,\nit gets somebody else to stop it.\n\n305\n00:16:01.536 --> 00:16:04.275\nBut by itself, it can only detect, right?\n\n306\n00:16:04.275 --> 00:16:06.210\nThat's what it does.\n\n307\n00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.420\nSo IDS and IPS,\nwe have our host based stuff.\n\n308\n00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.100\nBut by that point the attacker\nis already all the way to us.\n\n309\n00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.490\nIf we can stop it at the network,\nthat's even better.\n\n310\n00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:21.310\nAll right, other things that we can do on\nthe network to help secure our systems,\n\n311\n00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:22.670\nauthentication.\n\n312\n00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.750\nWhen somebody connects to our network\nwe don't normally authenticate them.\n\n313\n00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.710\nIf you fire up a web browser and\n\n314\n00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.280\nyou go to www.google.com,\nyou're gonna get their search engine.\n\n315\n00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.140\nAnd you can do searches and\nthey're not gonna ask you for a username.\n\n316\n00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.900\nIf you go to www.amazon.com\nyou can shop all you want,\n\n317\n00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.420\nthey'll never ask you for a username.\n\n318\n00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.310\nUntil you want to buy something,\nthen you've got to authenticate it, right?\n\n319\n00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.700\nSo most of the users on\nthe side are anonymous.\n\n320\n00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.750\nHow do I filter people\nif they're anonymous?\n\n321\n00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:49.860\nYou can't.\n\n322\n00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.070\nSo we can turn on authentication.\n\n323\n00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.470\nNow we might have authentication\nbuilt into our system.\n\n324\n00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.860\nBut there's plenty of protocols out there,\nthat really don't have authentication.\n\n325\n00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.010\nSo, we can force authentication\nthrough a few different means.\n\n326\n00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:05.950\nYou might have things like a active\ndirectory in place, or open directory,\n\n327\n00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.840\nopen LDAP, whatever.\n\n328\n00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.000\nBut when somebody is connected to a TFTP\nserver, TFTP doesn't ask for user and\n\n329\n00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.090\npassword, it doesn't have that.\n\n330\n00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:16.910\nSo we can control access\nto the network instead.\n\n331\n00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.525\nWe can say, in order for you to connect to\nthe network, you've got to authenticate.\n\n332\n00:17:20.525 --> 00:17:23.820\n802.1X is one example of that\nwhere you use a certificate.\n\n333\n00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.740\nBut there's other technologies that can\nbe used too, like RADIUS and TACACS.\n\n334\n00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.390\nRADIUS and\nTACACS are two very old protocols.\n\n335\n00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.180\nThey were designed back\nin the dial-up days,\n\n336\n00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.600\nwhen you dial-up to\nan internet service provider.\n\n337\n00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.990\nYou had to set up a username and password.\n\n338\n00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.280\nAnd you would do that through\neither RADIUS or TACACS,\n\n339\n00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.460\nyou would authenticate, and\nthen based on that authentication,\n\n340\n00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.960\nthey could then authorize you\nto perform certain actions.\n\n341\n00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.310\nYou are authorized to do tasks X, Y,\nand Z, but not tasks A, B, and C.\n\n342\n00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:53.080\nYou could kind of pick and choose.\n\n343\n00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.820\nAnd then they would do accounting.\n\n344\n00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.110\nThen we keep track of how\nlong you're connected.\n\n345\n00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.820\nWhat you did while you're connected.\n\n346\n00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.430\nWhen you disconnected then and so on.\n\n347\n00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:03.210\nThey keep records of all of that.\n\n348\n00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.330\nSo, these are wanted call AAA protocols.\n\n349\n00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.590\nAuthentication, authorisation,\nand accounting, AAA.\n\n350\n00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.010\nAnd that's what their function was.\n\n351\n00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:16.650\nThe neat part about them is\nTACACS has pretty much died off,\n\n352\n00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:21.720\nbut RADIUS is an open standard and\ndarn near everybody supports it.\n\n353\n00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.680\nWindows, Linux, Mac OS,\nCisco, Juniper, HP,\n\n354\n00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.060\nall these different vendors support it.\n\n355\n00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.220\nSo it's a common element I can use\nto authenticate across all devices.\n\n356\n00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.560\nYou know, Don, you said TACACS.\n\n357\n00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.420\nIt's an old protocol and\nwe really don't use it.\n\n358\n00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:40.930\nBut I do see one out there and really\nthe only variation is the fact that at\n\n359\n00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.380\nthe end of the name it has a plus on it.\n\n360\n00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.660\nSo it's TACACS +.\n\n361\n00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.060\nCould you tell us a little bit about that?\n\n362\n00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.815\nAnd what would the difference be?\n\n363\n00:18:46.815 --> 00:18:47.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n364\n00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.440\nWhat happened is TACACS\nbasically got abandoned.\n\n365\n00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.050\nAnd nobody really worked with it anymore,\nbut Cisco really liked it and so\n\n366\n00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:57.000\nCisco kept working with it and\nthey kept changing it.\n\n367\n00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.880\nAnd they would change it and it would\nsubmit it to be put into the standard, but\n\n368\n00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.530\nthe standards weren't being approved\nbecause nobody used the protocol anymore\n\n369\n00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.140\nso why bother updating the standard?\n\n370\n00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.140\nSo Cisco just said screw it,\nwe're gonna make it better.\n\n371\n00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.060\nWe're the only ones using it anyway,\nwe're just gonna make it better.\n\n372\n00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.864\nSo that's what they've done,\nand they've changed it so\n\n373\n00:19:11.864 --> 00:19:14.736\nmuch that it's not compatible\nanymore with the standard.\n\n374\n00:19:14.736 --> 00:19:18.780\nAnd so they renamed it TACACS+, which\nmeans this is Cisco's implementation.\n\n375\n00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:19.880\nIt's not a standard anymore.\n\n376\n00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.620\nNow it's kind of Cisco proprietary.\n\n377\n00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:26.120\nSo Cisco devices still use TACACS+, and\nremember I mentioned the AAA thing,\n\n378\n00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.100\nAuthentication, authorization,\nand accounting.\n\n379\n00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:34.940\nWell RADIUS is really good at\nauthentication and accounting.\n\n380\n00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.230\nIt's not very good at authorization.\n\n381\n00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.550\nIt's not able to get really granular.\n\n382\n00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:42.090\nIt basically says yeah you're allowed\nto connect or no you're not allowed to\n\n383\n00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.700\nconnect, yes you're an administrator or\nno you're not an administrator.\n\n384\n00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.020\nAnd that's it.\n\n385\n00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:50.510\nBut TACACS, boy TACACS,\nyou could get super granular.\n\n386\n00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:55.390\nYou could say, Wes is an administrator and\nhe's allowed to run these three commands.\n\n387\n00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:58.620\nAnd he's allowed to run this command\nwith just these command line arguments.\n\n388\n00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.170\nYou can get super specific about\nwhat you're allowed to do.\n\n389\n00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.530\nBut it stinks at accounting, right?\n\n390\n00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.010\nIt keeps bad records.\n\n391\n00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:11.690\nSo what Cisco said was, man, RADIUS is\ngood at accounting, bad at authorization.\n\n392\n00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.651\nTACACS is good at authorization,\nbad at accounting.\n\n393\n00:20:14.651 --> 00:20:16.478\nWhat if we combined the two?\n\n394\n00:20:16.478 --> 00:20:21.360\nWhat if we used RADIUS for authentication,\ncuz everybody supports it.\n\n395\n00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.660\nAnd we use RADIUS for accounting,\ncuz it's really good at it.\n\n396\n00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.140\nAnd we use TACACS for authorization,\ncuz it's really good at it.\n\n397\n00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:29.920\nAnd that's what they've done.\n\n398\n00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.880\nCisco has a product called ACS,\nthe Access Control Server and\n\n399\n00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.930\nit bonds those two protocols\ntogether to create one solution.\n\n400\n00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.650\nAnd that's because they wanted to\nhave the best features possible.\n\n401\n00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.320\nSo that's why Cisco still supports it.\n\n402\n00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.040\nNobody else does.\n\n403\n00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.616\nEverybody else just says forget it and\nthey do RADIUS and that's that, but\n\n404\n00:20:46.616 --> 00:20:47.593\nthey are out there.\n\n405\n00:20:47.593 --> 00:20:49.197\nSo definitely be aware of those.\n\n406\n00:20:49.197 --> 00:20:52.288\n&gt;&gt; One of the things you mentioned\nwhen you were talking about 8021.X\n\n407\n00:20:52.288 --> 00:20:54.000\nis the certificate based side of that.\n\n408\n00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.860\nNow, Don, with these certificates\ncan you tell us a little bit\n\n409\n00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.330\nabout the infrastructure or\nthe technologies behind it?\n\n410\n00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.730\nIf we are going to go and\n\n411\n00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:06.340\nmaybe implement something like that where\nwe get the best and the highest security?\n\n412\n00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; When we talk about certificates, right?\n\n413\n00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.930\nWhat a certificate really is is\njust a jumbled mess of hexadecimal\n\n414\n00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:14.720\ncharacters, right?\n\n415\n00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.630\nLetters and numbers kind of jumbled\ntogether that work as a, like a password.\n\n416\n00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.300\nSo that I can take data, encrypt it,\n\n417\n00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.850\nand if you know my password,\nyou can decrypt that data.\n\n418\n00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.480\nIt's a way of keeping data safe.\n\n419\n00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.840\nIf you're authenticating\nover a network and\n\n420\n00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.720\nyou're sending traffic across a network,\nyou want it to be encrypted.\n\n421\n00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.280\nThe challenge is,\nsetting up that password, right?\n\n422\n00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.510\nSo Wes is standing right here besides me,\nand if I say Wes,\n\n423\n00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.890\nI'm gonna send you some data tonight and\nit's gonna be encrypted and\n\n424\n00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.760\nif you want to get it,\nhere's the password, right?\n\n425\n00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.260\nPassword 123,\nsame password I use on my luggage, so\n\n426\n00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.620\nI send it to him,\nwell I just told him in person.\n\n427\n00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.030\nSo he goes home, he sits down, he gets\nthe data and he's able to decrypt it,\n\n428\n00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:56.080\nno big deal, nice and safe If anybody else\ngot that data it doesn't do them any good.\n\n429\n00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.750\nThey didn't get the password.\n\n430\n00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:02.650\nBut what if I go and talk to somebody and\nI need it to be encrypted right away and\n\n431\n00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:04.490\nI've never met them before?\n\n432\n00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:05.860\nLet's go back to Amazon as an example.\n\n433\n00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:09.480\nI go to Amazon's webpage and\nI want to start communicating securely,\n\n434\n00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.910\nbecause I'm about to buy something from\nthem, I've never talked to them before.\n\n435\n00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.848\nSo if I've never talked to them before,\nhow do they get me that password?\n\n436\n00:22:15.848 --> 00:22:17.580\nThey gonna email it to me?\n\n437\n00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:18.370\nEmail is not secure.\n\n438\n00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.210\nAre they gonna call me on the phone?\n\n439\n00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.900\nImagine that, imagine every time you went\nto a web page if you wanted to secure your\n\n440\n00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.670\nconnection they had to call you on\nthe phone and tell you a password, right?\n\n441\n00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.830\nIt would just be so inconvenient.\n\n442\n00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:32.280\nSo what we have is a certificate\nsystem that's designed to work for\n\n443\n00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.630\nspontaneous communications.\n\n444\n00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:38.410\nI just met you, this is the first\ntime we've ever talked, but\n\n445\n00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:41.780\nhere is a secure communications pathway\nyou can use to talk to each other,\n\n446\n00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.120\nand it's encrypted and\nnobody can mess with it right.\n\n447\n00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.810\nThat is kind of the secret\nbehind what certificates do.\n\n448\n00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.510\nAnd, the certificates themselves\naren't the real secret.\n\n449\n00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:54.750\nThe real secret is TLS,\nTransport Layer Security,\n\n450\n00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.640\nor what was originally SSL,\nSecure Socket Layer.\n\n451\n00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.430\nSecure Socket Layer was a way for\ntwo devices to communicate and\n\n452\n00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.330\nexchange passwords and\nthen start communicating securely.\n\n453\n00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:06.920\nThere were some vulnerabilities,\nit got compromised a few times,\n\n454\n00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.450\ndifferent versions came out, and\nso now it's been replaced by TLS.\n\n455\n00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.750\nSSL was designed for web traffic HTTP.\n\n456\n00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.970\nTLS takes the same technology and\ncan apply it to anything.\n\n457\n00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:21.500\nSo now we can use those same certificates\nto secure not just web traffic, but FTP,\n\n458\n00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:26.820\nnetwork time servers,\nfile servers, darn near anything.\n\n459\n00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.820\nStuff that we couldn't secure\nbefore now we can using TLS.\n\n460\n00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:31.840\nSo the way it works.\n\n461\n00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.360\nLet me go over the way that it works.\n\n462\n00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.770\nI actually still have VPNs that\nI need to talk about, too.\n\n463\n00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.650\nSo we'll probably put\nthat off to a part two.\n\n464\n00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:39.730\nBut the way the certificates work,\n\n465\n00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:44.300\nis if I were doing what's\ncalled symmetric encryption.\n\n466\n00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.660\nAnd that's the example\nI gave with WestonEye.\n\n467\n00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:51.970\nThat I have some data, and\nI create a symmetric key.\n\n468\n00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.058\nAnd that symmetric key is a password.\n\n469\n00:23:54.058 --> 00:23:58.379\nAnd I encrypt my data,\nand I send it over to Wes.\n\n470\n00:23:58.379 --> 00:24:02.254\nAnd as long as Wes has that same password,\nhe can decrypt it.\n\n471\n00:24:02.254 --> 00:24:05.489\nNow, that password, that's private,\nI don't want anybody to get that.\n\n472\n00:24:05.489 --> 00:24:08.340\nSo, I'm calling that my private key.\n\n473\n00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:12.270\nIf I have to send that private\nkey to him over the network,\n\n474\n00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.060\nover the same network that I'm\ngonna be sending the data,\n\n475\n00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.940\nsomebody could just intercept it, and\nthis whole thing's a waste of time.\n\n476\n00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:23.260\nSo, I really need to send that private\nkey over a separate pathway via mail,\n\n477\n00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.230\nphysical mail, or call him on the phone,\nor fax it to him, or\n\n478\n00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.700\nsomething crazy like that, and\nthat's just not convenient.\n\n479\n00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:35.910\nSo, this type of authentication, or\ndecryption doesn't really work very well.\n\n480\n00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:38.370\nBut man, is it efficient, this is\nreally an efficient way to do things,\n\n481\n00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:42.369\nyou have one key that encrypts the same\nkey decrypts, it moves very, very fast.\n\n482\n00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:48.320\nWell, to try and\nsolve the problem of hitting off this key,\n\n483\n00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.250\nwe have a different system,\nwhich is called asymmetric encryption.\n\n484\n00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:57.410\nAnd what asymmetric encryption you\nactually have a mixture of public and\n\n485\n00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.250\nprivate keys, all right?\n\n486\n00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:04.760\nA private key,\nthat's a key that is your super secret\n\n487\n00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.800\npassword, it allows you to encrypt and\ndecrypt data.\n\n488\n00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.470\nIf somebody gets all of your private key,\nyou're in real trouble.\n\n489\n00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:18.980\nBut you can take that private key, and\nyou can use it to generate a public key.\n\n490\n00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.122\nA public key is tied to your private key.\n\n491\n00:25:22.122 --> 00:25:27.767\nAnd when you generate a public key, a\npublic key does not let you decrypt data.\n\n492\n00:25:27.767 --> 00:25:30.830\nIt only lets you encrypt data.\n\n493\n00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:37.854\nSomebody could take some data, encrypt it\nusing my public key and send it to me.\n\n494\n00:25:37.854 --> 00:25:39.990\nI've already got the private key,\ncuz I'm the one who made.\n\n495\n00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:43.000\nAnd so,\nI can now decrypt that information.\n\n496\n00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.890\nWhen you reach out and talk to Amazon, and\nthey flip you over to a secure page, or\n\n497\n00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:50.810\nif you just go to our site,\ngo to ITPro.TV, it'll default to secure.\n\n498\n00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:53.300\nThere's a moment you go there,\nit'll flip over to secure.\n\n499\n00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.460\nAnd what's happening is we're giving\nyou a copy of our public key.\n\n500\n00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.160\nWe're saying here,\ntake a copy of the public key.\n\n501\n00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:05.780\nAnd once you've got that, you can encrypt\nanything you want using our public key,\n\n502\n00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.740\nand send it to us, and\nwe'll be able to read it, right?\n\n503\n00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:12.500\nSo now, you've got a secure\nmethod to send stuff to us.\n\n504\n00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.760\n&gt;&gt; Don, now, why would this be safer?\n\n505\n00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:19.110\nIt looks like we still a key that is being\ntransferred publicly across the wire.\n\n506\n00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.350\nSo with Semetric,\nwhere we got to securely transfer it.\n\n507\n00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:26.260\nWhy is this secure when I still\nhave a key that is gonna be,\n\n508\n00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.520\nis going to be transferred\nover a public connection?\n\n509\n00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.730\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, think about what\nhappens if somebody intercepts this.\n\n510\n00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.630\nSo, if there's a hacker, a man in the\nmiddle, right, somebody in the middle, and\n\n511\n00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:37.070\nthey intercept this public key\nwhen it transits the network.\n\n512\n00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.680\nWhen they get that key, what can they do?\n\n513\n00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.320\nThey can't decrypt anything,\n\n514\n00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.680\nthey can't read the data that's\nbeing sent, they can just encrypt.\n\n515\n00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.240\nSo, they can encrypt data and\nthrow it in our tunnel, and it's not gonna\n\n516\n00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.980\nmake any sense, because it's gonna\nhave the wrong sequence numbers.\n\n517\n00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:55.210\nIt's not gonna know what's going on, and\nwe're just gonna discard it as garbage.\n\n518\n00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:56.590\nSo, it doesn't hurt anything.\n\n519\n00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.610\nSo this key,\nI don't care who gets the public key, and\n\n520\n00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:00.370\nthat's why we make them\npublicly available.\n\n521\n00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:03.350\nWhen you go to Amazon,\nthey send you a public key.\n\n522\n00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.860\nWhen you go to our website,\nwe send you a public key.\n\n523\n00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:09.620\nNow, most of the time, we're generating\na unique public key for every person that\n\n524\n00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:14.500\nconnects, a session key, but there is\na common public key that is right there,\n\n525\n00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.870\nas the certificate on that site that\nis publicly available to anybody.\n\n526\n00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.610\nThat's why they call it a public key.\n\n527\n00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:24.480\nBut it was built from a private key, it is\nnot publicly available, that you can't, or\n\n528\n00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.560\nyou shouldn't be able to download.\n\n529\n00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.460\nThat's why the heartbleed exploit was so\n\n530\n00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.720\ndangerous, because you\nget the private key.\n\n531\n00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:34.040\nBut that private key should be super safe,\nand never transmitted over the network.\n\n532\n00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.930\n&gt;&gt; So Don, let me see if I understand\nthis, If I had a box right here, and it\n\n533\n00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:41.360\nhad to keys on it, will that be a saying\nwell, if I put a message in that box,\n\n534\n00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.830\nand that one public key is only gonna\nlock the box, and I send it to you,\n\n535\n00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:50.146\nyou're gonna have the only other key\nthat I can take actually open a box.\n\n536\n00:27:50.146 --> 00:27:51.920\n&gt;&gt; Right, yep,\nthen it'll be able to unlock it,\n\n537\n00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.080\nand this whole time we're\ntalking about one direction,\n\n538\n00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.910\nwe still have the other direction\nthat think about, right?\n\n539\n00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:01.480\nSo, using my example here,\nlet me get some of this off the screen,\n\n540\n00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.730\nthis private key,\nI'll talk about here in just a minute.\n\n541\n00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:05.530\nOops, and we have no cloud now.\n\n542\n00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:12.558\nBut [LAUGH] I got a little aggressive\nin my key deletion there, but [LAUGH].\n\n543\n00:28:12.558 --> 00:28:13.950\n&gt;&gt; Great,\nyou've brought the Internet down.\n\n544\n00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:15.100\n&gt;&gt; Well, so,\n\n545\n00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:19.950\nbasically what we've got is that private\nkey doesn't change hands, right?\n\n546\n00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:20.910\nIt stays on my server.\n\n547\n00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.900\nThe public key does change hands,\nit get sent across.\n\n548\n00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:30.680\nAnd when that happens, now, this client\ncan encrypt data using the public key and\n\n549\n00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.900\nsend it to the server, and\nthe server can decrypt it, right?\n\n550\n00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.462\nBut what if the server wants to reply?\n\n551\n00:28:37.462 --> 00:28:41.101\nWe need to reply, we need to be able\nto reach back to people and say hey,\n\n552\n00:28:41.101 --> 00:28:43.650\nI got your data,\nhere's something new for you.\n\n553\n00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:48.910\nWe need to reply back, well what\nhappens is your client can generate\n\n554\n00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:54.400\na private key just for this session,\na temporary private key.\n\n555\n00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.430\nAnd they can generate a public key\nbased on that, and they can take\n\n556\n00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:03.132\ntheir public key and they can encrypt it\nusing my public key and send it to me.\n\n557\n00:29:03.132 --> 00:29:09.120\nAnd then I can decrypt it, and now I've\ngot a public key to respond back to them.\n\n558\n00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:15.060\nAnd so, the server can encrypt using\nthe public key it got to send back to us,\n\n559\n00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.850\nand we'll be able to decrypt\nthis as a client and read it.\n\n560\n00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.600\nAnd so now,\nI've got two way communications.\n\n561\n00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:26.100\nAnd it's asymmetric,\nbecause I'm using one key to send and\n\n562\n00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:30.330\na different key to receive,\nto create this two way communication.\n\n563\n00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:34.770\nNow, that is not a sufficient, as when\nyou just have one key that has both.\n\n564\n00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.340\nSo a little slower,\nit takes more CPU resources.\n\n565\n00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:41.330\nBut it's a lot more secure when it's\nthe first time you've met somebody.\n\n566\n00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:44.640\nCuz we didn't have to\npre-agree on a password.\n\n567\n00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.990\nWe've created the password\nright here in the session, and\n\n568\n00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.600\neverything that crossed\nthe network was encrypted.\n\n569\n00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:54.090\nAt no point did unencrypted data\npass the network, except for\n\n570\n00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:56.650\nwhen we initially sent our\npublic key over to the client.\n\n571\n00:29:56.650 --> 00:30:00.870\nAnd that's public data anyway, so\nwe don't care if someone intercepts that.\n\n572\n00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:03.550\nEverything else was encrypted and safe.\n\n573\n00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:06.790\n&gt;&gt; Don, you've been talking about\nwe generate these certificates.\n\n574\n00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:10.040\nAnd we present these certificates,\nwhat technology,\n\n575\n00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.970\nis it really me that is\ngenerating these keys?\n\n576\n00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.640\nWhat body or technology is it that\nactually controls those keys?\n\n577\n00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.930\nOr I should say Issues those keys?\n\n578\n00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.260\n&gt;&gt; All right, the assurance we\nneed is that anybody can do it.\n\n579\n00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.430\nAnybody can make a certificate.\n\n580\n00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:24.650\nI can make a certificate\nright here in my laptop.\n\n581\n00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:29.410\nThe problem is, how do you know\nthat you can trust my certificate?\n\n582\n00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:32.170\nYou don't, maybe you've never met me.\n\n583\n00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:34.430\nYou don't know my last name, or whatever.\n\n584\n00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:35.580\nHow do you know you can trust me?\n\n585\n00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.509\nI might be a really bad person.\n\n586\n00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.250\nMaybe, but\n\n587\n00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.960\nwe need some kind of way to know\nwhether we can trust the certificates.\n\n588\n00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.830\nIf Wes sends me a certificate,\nI know Wes, we go way back, I trust him,\n\n589\n00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:47.790\nI'll trust the certificate he sends me.\n\n590\n00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:50.880\nBut if I go to Amazon, and\nthey've never met me before,\n\n591\n00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.620\nhow do they know they can trust me?\n\n592\n00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:53.730\nThey don't.\n\n593\n00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:58.010\nSo, what we need is some\nthird-party to get involved,\n\n594\n00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:00.570\nsomebody who can validate our identity.\n\n595\n00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:04.440\nAnd that's where PKIs come in,\na Public Key Infrastructure.\n\n596\n00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.280\nYou can create your own PKI,\nbut nobody's gonna trust you.\n\n597\n00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:12.866\nBut there's companies on the Internet,\nlike Verisign, and Thought,\n\n598\n00:31:12.866 --> 00:31:16.100\nand DigiCert, where, that's their job.\n\n599\n00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:19.450\nTheir job is they come out and\nsay look, you can trust us.\n\n600\n00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:23.480\nWhen somebody buys a certificate from us,\nwe make them prove who they are.\n\n601\n00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.390\nThey send us their identity,\nwe ask for some financial records or\n\n602\n00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.550\nwhatever to verify they are,\nthat they are who they say they are.\n\n603\n00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.300\nAnd only when they've gone\nthrough our verification process,\n\n604\n00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.430\nwill we sign off on their certificate.\n\n605\n00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:40.650\nSo, when you go to a website\nlike Amazon or ITPro.TV,\n\n606\n00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:43.510\nthat certificate was issued by somebody,\nright?\n\n607\n00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:47.040\nSo, if I go to, here,\nI'll fire up a browser, and\n\n608\n00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.880\nI'll go to the ITPro.TV website.\n\n609\n00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.230\nWhen I go to the ITPro.TV website,\nit's gonna flip over and\n\n610\n00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.088\ndo a secure communication.\n\n611\n00:31:54.088 --> 00:31:57.949\nAnd so mine's secure, I see the lower\nlock and it turn green up top, okay.\n\n612\n00:31:57.949 --> 00:32:02.188\nAnd it did that because we've got\na certificate, right, so it says here,\n\n613\n00:32:02.188 --> 00:32:06.565\nif URL is using an encrypted connection\nITPro.TV And it says DigiCert Inc has\n\n614\n00:32:06.565 --> 00:32:11.212\nidentified ITPro TV as being owned by\nITPro.TV, Edutainment Live, that's our\n\n615\n00:32:11.212 --> 00:32:16.440\ncompany, in Gainesville Florida,\nthat's where I'm standing right now.\n\n616\n00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.130\nDigiCert verified all that.\n\n617\n00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:22.960\nWhen we bought that certificate they\nmade us provide information that\n\n618\n00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.470\nprove we were who we said we were.\n\n619\n00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:29.660\nIf I go to a website and\nits a certificate that I don't trust,\n\n620\n00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:33.700\nthen it's a different story then\nI don't know anymore, right?\n\n621\n00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:37.360\nIs it somebody that I actually\ntrust that I can use it or not?\n\n622\n00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.890\nIt's gonna be for me to figure that out,\nso that's what they do.\n\n623\n00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:45.080\nAnd a public infrastructure is really\nall the little pieces that make up\n\n624\n00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.760\na certificate solution,\nthere's really several different parts.\n\n625\n00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.860\nYou've got the client, and\nthe server,that you connect to, right?\n\n626\n00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:56.760\nYou've got the signed certificate, that's\nthe public key that's being handed out.\n\n627\n00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.050\nWell, who is it that\nsigns that certificate?\n\n628\n00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:00.840\nIt's a certificate authority.\n\n629\n00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.640\nSo, DigiCert is our certificate\nauthority that we use on our site.\n\n630\n00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.550\nWe went to them to buy a certificate.\n\n631\n00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:10.730\nWell, when you buy a certificate, the\ncertificate is stored in the database and\n\n632\n00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:14.140\nyou have what's called the Certificate\nAuthority that issues that cert and\n\n633\n00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.770\nstores in the database.\n\n634\n00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:19.920\nWell, if somebody were to break into that\ncertificate authority, they can generate\n\n635\n00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.180\nall sorts of certificates pretending\nto be all sorts of people and\n\n636\n00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.180\nthat would be really, really bad.\n\n637\n00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:30.720\nSo most of the providers like DigiCert\nkeep their CA what's called air-gapped.\n\n638\n00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.970\nIt's not plugged in to a network.\n\n639\n00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:35.540\nIt's not connected to the Internet,\nit's not connected usually to any network.\n\n640\n00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.140\nThey typically don't have\na network adapter in them.\n\n641\n00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:42.680\nAnd that CA is kept offline so that\nnobody could remotely gain access to it.\n\n642\n00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.930\nAnd that CA will generate certificates for\nwhat are called subordinate CA's and\n\n643\n00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:50.820\nthe subordinate CA's are online and\n\n644\n00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.680\nthey're the ones that are issuing\nout the certificates for us.\n\n645\n00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:57.310\nAnd any time they need to update\na CA they take a usb key and\n\n646\n00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:02.120\nthey generate an update, they carry it\nover to the other server, sign the cert,\n\n647\n00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.940\ncarry it back over to the subordinate CA,\nand reissue it right?\n\n648\n00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.850\nBut that would be for\nthe subordinate CA cert itself.\n\n649\n00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:11.330\nThe subordinate CA has the authority to\nissue out all the other certs without\n\n650\n00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.580\ngetting the primary involved so we're\nnot having to carry everything back and\n\n651\n00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.790\nforth just when we do an update.\n\n652\n00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:21.280\nNow over time a certificate\nmight get revoked.\n\n653\n00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.020\nAnd so, they're maintaining\na certificate revocation list.\n\n654\n00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.570\nSo, anytime I see a cert,\nI might trust who issued it and\n\n655\n00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:30.360\nit might not have expired and all that,\nbut it might have been revoked.\n\n656\n00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.790\nSo, I'm gonna reach out to them and ask\nthem, hey, has this cert been revoked and\n\n657\n00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:35.280\nlook at the list and find out.\n\n658\n00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.865\nThat's what that CRL does.\n\n659\n00:34:36.865 --> 00:34:37.917\nAll right.\n\n660\n00:34:37.917 --> 00:34:38.900\nThe CSR I didn't talk about.\n\n661\n00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.110\nThat's the Certificate Signing Request.\n\n662\n00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:43.350\nWhen I ask for a certificate,\nI create a Certificate Signing Request.\n\n663\n00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.270\nThat's part of the buying process\nwhen you go to buy a cert.\n\n664\n00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:50.170\nSo all this infrastructure is what's\ngoing on behind the scenes for\n\n665\n00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:51.190\nthese certificates.\n\n666\n00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:52.050\nWhen you go to Amazon and\n\n667\n00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:55.100\nyou get that secure page,\nthey went through this process.\n\n668\n00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.790\nThey had to go out and buy a cert and\nget that signed off on.\n\n669\n00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:00.340\nAnd for many years they used Verisign.\n\n670\n00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:05.850\nNow, Amazon actually is a CA, and\nso they issue their own cert now.\n\n671\n00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:09.320\nBut not everybody trusted Amazon back in\nthe day, and so they had to use Verisign,\n\n672\n00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.650\nthey had to use somebody else.\n\n673\n00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:14.330\nThat's how it works until a company\ngets really big and really trusted.\n\n674\n00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:17.960\nThey've got to rely on someone\nelse to issue those certificates.\n\n675\n00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.090\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\nthat is a lot of great information.\n\n676\n00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:21.775\nHowever looking at our list.\n\n677\n00:35:21.775 --> 00:35:22.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know you've got more,\n\n678\n00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.100\nI mean I love to consider\nhere with network security.\n\n679\n00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:25.800\nSo, how about this?\n\n680\n00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.890\nHow about we go ahead and\nstop this episode and\n\n681\n00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:32.080\nwe'll go into a part two and\nI'll give you a chance to come back and\n\n682\n00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:36.070\nmaybe finish up the additional topics\nthat you have for network security.\n\n683\n00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:37.890\nBut, before we sign out on this one,\n\n684\n00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:41.440\nyou have any additional advice you'd\nlike to maybe tell our viewers?\n\n685\n00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.560\n&gt;&gt; Key thing to remember that I didn't\nreally talk too much about on certificates\n\n686\n00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.830\nis that they do expire.\n\n687\n00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:48.030\nAnd so they have to be renewed over time.\n\n688\n00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:51.340\nThey usually only last one or two years,\nso you're constantly having to renew them.\n\n689\n00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.440\nAnd you'll need that to be\npart of your process here,\n\n690\n00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.740\npart of your server maintenance.\n\n691\n00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.080\nCuz if the certificate expires,\nall of a sudden,\n\n692\n00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.710\nyour server goes down, you have an outage.\n\n693\n00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:00.680\nAnd it takes a little while to\nget certificates reissued, so\n\n694\n00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.640\nyou don't want to get caught\nby surprise on that one.\n\n695\n00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.030\nBut we're going to talk more about\ncertificates in part two because we also\n\n696\n00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.800\nneed to talk about VPN tunnels, which\nleverage certificate technologies as well.\n\n697\n00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.710\nSo we're gonna see a lot\nmore of that coming up.\n\n698\n00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:13.290\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\na wealth of great information.\n\n699\n00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:14.660\nLook forward to seeing it in part two.\n\n700\n00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.760\nWe look forward to seeing\nyou there as well.\n\n701\n00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.900\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n702\n00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:20.632\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n703\n00:36:20.632 --> 00:36:22.552\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n704\n00:36:22.552 --> 00:36:28.580\n[MUSIC]\n\n705\n00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.758\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.430\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.811\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:14.145\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:15.559\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.861\nAnd in today's episode we're continuing\nthrough our CompTIA Server Plus series and\n\n8\n00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:23.160\nwe're actually coming back with\na part two in Network Security.\n\n9\n00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.360\nSo to help us with the topics we missed\nin the first part of this is Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.500\nDon, how are you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.130\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes,\nready to jump back in and\n\n12\n00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.960\ntidy up some of the stuff that we didn't\nget to in part one and we're gonna\n\n13\n00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.240\ntalk about some technologies here that\nare really focusing on the network, right?\n\n14\n00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.820\nThis objective is called\nNetwork Security so it makes sense.\n\n15\n00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.810\nAnd usually we're talking\nabout securing the network\n\n16\n00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.660\nthat our server is connected to.\n\n17\n00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.410\nSo all the devices in part one\nthe firewalls that we talk about, and\n\n18\n00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.900\ncertificates and\n\n19\n00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.230\nstuff like that is all designed to secure\nthe network that the server is on.\n\n20\n00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.360\nBut increasingly, we're gonna see\nwhere our servers are connected\n\n21\n00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.700\nnot just to a little old network\nsomewhere but to the Internet.\n\n22\n00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.780\nAnd via the Internet to networks all\nover the world, a massive environment.\n\n23\n00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.090\nAnd so how do we secure that?\n\n24\n00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.070\nHow do we make sure our\ndata access is secure\n\n25\n00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.900\neven when it crosses\nsomething like the Internet?\n\n26\n00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.240\nWell, in the last episode we talked\na little bit about certificates.\n\n27\n00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.640\nWe talked about SSL and how they work.\n\n28\n00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.730\nHow we have a private key and public key.\n\n29\n00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.980\nWe build an encrypted session in\nbetween a server and a client.\n\n30\n00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.250\nAnd it works great for web servers.\n\n31\n00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.860\nBut what about all\nthe other stuff that we do?\n\n32\n00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.050\nWhat about things like file servers and\nother stuff?\n\n33\n00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.560\nWell, SSL, and I don't want to go too deep\nbecause I know I mentioned it in the last\n\n34\n00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.880\nepisode that SSL's kind\nof been replaced by TLS.\n\n35\n00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.190\nAnd TLS allows us to apply SSL\nCertificates to all sorts of crazy things.\n\n36\n00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.710\nTo things, like, file servers,\nand email servers, and stuff,\n\n37\n00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.800\nwhere it really wasn't intended for it.\n\n38\n00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.920\nBut, you're still going to have\nother services on your network\n\n39\n00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.380\nthat don't support that,\nthat may not be secure, but\n\n40\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.870\nyou need to make them secure somehow, and\nso, there's another great technology that\n\n41\n00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.340\nwe use in conjunction with our service\nto provide that and it's called a VPN.\n\n42\n00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.420\nA VPN is a virtual private network.\n\n43\n00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.758\nAnd virtual private networks came about\nas a result of two different things.\n\n44\n00:02:08.758 --> 00:02:12.185\nOne, people working remotely a lot more,\nright?\n\n45\n00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:15.286\nSo people aren't always in your office,\nor in their office,\n\n46\n00:02:15.286 --> 00:02:18.910\nthey might be in temporary\nlocations all over the place.\n\n47\n00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.280\nAnd then, two,\nthe proliferation of the Internet.\n\n48\n00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.480\nWe have Internet access everywhere,\nso no matter where somebody goes,\n\n49\n00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.280\nthey're might be at their office,\nthey might be in a hotel room, but\n\n50\n00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.110\nthey'll have Internet access, and they'll\nneed access to their work materials.\n\n51\n00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.080\nDon before the show started I'm\nthinking if I've got a remote\n\n52\n00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.860\nuser why don't I just get one\nof these dedicated lease lines?\n\n53\n00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.660\nWhy don't I use that?\n\n54\n00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.370\nWhy do I need any other technology if\nI've already got something like that\n\n55\n00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.600\nthat was in place?\n\n56\n00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.385\n&gt;&gt; Well that's the old way to do it,\nright?\n\n57\n00:02:46.385 --> 00:02:51.395\nWas if I had a headquarters, let's see\nthat we work for a grocery store, right?\n\n58\n00:02:51.395 --> 00:02:53.695\nAnd you had a headquarters\nlocated in one city and\n\n59\n00:02:53.695 --> 00:02:58.515\nyou had 50 stores located out across\nthe country or state or whatever.\n\n60\n00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:01.865\nWell, how do all of those stores\nconnect back to your headquarters?\n\n61\n00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:04.875\nI mean, you probably have a centralized\ndatabase, email servers, stuff like that.\n\n62\n00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:07.310\nSo how do they get back to that Data?\n\n63\n00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.400\nWell the older days you'd\nbuy point to point line.\n\n64\n00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.630\nYou'd buy T1 lines or\nfiber optic lines and get them run.\n\n65\n00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.190\nThat is expensive.\n\n66\n00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.640\nIt's costly and it's not very flexible,\n\n67\n00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.890\nit assumes that all your employers\nare going to be at those locations.\n\n68\n00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.850\nWhat happens if we have\nsales people that travel,\n\n69\n00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.060\nor a great example I use to work for\nan insurance company, and so\n\n70\n00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.920\nyes we had insurance offices\nall over the state of Florida.\n\n71\n00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.100\nAnd all of those offices were\nwired up with point-to-point\n\n72\n00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.910\nlines that you could get to.\n\n73\n00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.410\nSo it was a stable very\nconsistent network.\n\n74\n00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.620\nBut when a hurricane would hit,\nwe had adjusters and\n\n75\n00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.500\nthe adjusters would go out into the field.\n\n76\n00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.043\nAnd they wouldn't be doing\nwork in their office,\n\n77\n00:03:47.043 --> 00:03:48.623\nthey wouldn't be doing\nwork at the headquarters,\n\n78\n00:03:48.623 --> 00:03:50.330\nthey wouldn't even be\ndoing work at the hotel.\n\n79\n00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.120\nThey would be in the middle of nowhere\nwith a cellular card stuck on their laptop\n\n80\n00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.930\ntrying to be able to file a claim and\n\n81\n00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.270\nissue a check to be able to\nget people's' stuff repaired.\n\n82\n00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.340\nHow do you provide secure\naccess to somebody like that?\n\n83\n00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.520\nWhen it's not even your network?\n\n84\n00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.360\nThey're on a cellular network.\n\n85\n00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.680\nWell, that's where VPNs come in.\n\n86\n00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.270\nWith a VPN, you can take your laptop and\ngo anywhere and\n\n87\n00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.970\nbuild a secure connection\nacross a public network.\n\n88\n00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.960\nLet me show you a little\ndiagram that I've got here.\n\n89\n00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.210\nSo, we typically have\na headquarters network and\n\n90\n00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.830\nthat's where our servers are going to be.\n\n91\n00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.770\nThings like if we have file servers and\ncertificate authorities and\n\n92\n00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.480\nall those other things that we\ntypically have at a headquarters.\n\n93\n00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.200\nThey're all gonna be right\nup here at our headquarters.\n\n94\n00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.900\nAnd we've got a firewall that\nconnects to the Internet via\n\n95\n00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.300\nwhatever connection it is we have.\n\n96\n00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.130\nMaybe we've got a OC12 or cable modem or\n\n97\n00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.800\nwho knows what bandwidth it is, we have\na metro Ethernet connection, right.\n\n98\n00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.080\nAnd we have branch offices and\nat those branch offices\n\n99\n00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.510\nthey probably have a firewall and\na connection to the Internet also.\n\n100\n00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.800\nMaybe broadband, cable, DSL,\nmaybe fiber, who knows.\n\n101\n00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.460\nAnd then you have people\nthat are at home or\n\n102\n00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.550\nremote, wandering the Earth as they\nsee like in the Kung-Fu shows.\n\n103\n00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.830\nSo they're wandering from village\nto village helping people and\n\n104\n00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.860\nthey need access to the domain controller,\nor to the file server,\n\n105\n00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.710\nto the other resources\nback at headquarters.\n\n106\n00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.790\nWell, if they communicate using a common\nnetwork like the Internet, that works.\n\n107\n00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.970\nI can go anywhere in the world,\nand get on the Internet,\n\n108\n00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.860\nand if my home office is connected to\nthe Internet also we can see each other.\n\n109\n00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.410\nThat's awesome,\nI don't even have to go to,\n\n110\n00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.150\nI can just go to a coffee shop in any\ncity and connect back to my headquarters.\n\n111\n00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.380\nThe problem is,\nwe don't control the Internet.\n\n112\n00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.480\nThe Internet is the wild west, right?\n\n113\n00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.690\nThere's all sorts of bad\nstuff going on out there.\n\n114\n00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.760\nAnd you don't want to send sensitive\ncorporate data over that Internet link if\n\n115\n00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.280\nyou can avoid it.\n\n116\n00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.900\nSo what we do is we build a tunnel.\n\n117\n00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.310\nAnd a tunnel is an encrypted session\nyou can build between a laptop\n\n118\n00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.810\nand a remote access server\nback at your headquarters.\n\n119\n00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.530\nAnd these days, a remote access\nserver is often times your firewall.\n\n120\n00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.350\nA larger organization will have\na dedicated VPN concentrator or\n\n121\n00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.360\na server that acts as that\nremote access server.\n\n122\n00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.520\nSmaller companies, like ours,\nwe use our firewall, so\n\n123\n00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.990\nwe just VPN right into\nthe firewall to gain access.\n\n124\n00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.110\nAnd when somebody VPNs in like this\nall of their data is encrypted\n\n125\n00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.580\non their laptop and sent across\nthe Internet in an encrypted form.\n\n126\n00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.020\nAnd at the other end of the remote\naccess server it's decrypted and\n\n127\n00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.220\ndumped on the network here, right?\n\n128\n00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.710\nSo now they have access to all\nthe headquarters resources\n\n129\n00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.820\nas if they were there.\n\n130\n00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.160\nAs if their laptop was physically\nin the headquarters building.\n\n131\n00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.320\nAnd they can access everything whether\nthe protocols support encryption or not.\n\n132\n00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.790\nThey can reach out and connect and\ngain access to those resources.\n\n133\n00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.910\nAnd that's a key and important thing.\n\n134\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.630\nI don't have to be in the office\nto have access to my resources.\n\n135\n00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.340\nAnd it's still secure,\nit's virtually private.\n\n136\n00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.520\nThat's the name virtual private network.\n\n137\n00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.970\nOur data is safe and secure.\n\n138\n00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.970\nNow when you build up a connection like\nthis there's several different protocols\n\n139\n00:06:58.970 --> 00:06:59.930\nthat are out there.\n\n140\n00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:05.220\nIf it's laptop dialing into a server,\nyou're gonna use L2TP or\n\n141\n00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.190\nPPTP, SSTP, all these different protocols\nthat are out there that you can use.\n\n142\n00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.680\nBut a lot of times, we're doing firewall\nto firewall, like in my example of\n\n143\n00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.250\nthe branch office connecting to the\nheadquarters, they both had a firewall.\n\n144\n00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.700\nAnd the advantage of doing that is we can\nbuild the tunnel between the firewalls and\n\n145\n00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.310\nthe end units don't even know about,\nright?\n\n146\n00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.310\nLet me just go back to my diagram for\na second.\n\n147\n00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.140\nWhen we take this tunnel, If we were to\nmove it up here to the branch office, and\n\n148\n00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.470\nin the branch office I've got\nthree computers and a server.\n\n149\n00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.620\nI would have to install VPN software\non each one of these four machines and\n\n150\n00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.170\nhave them build four tunnels back\nto headquarters to get it to work.\n\n151\n00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:45.120\nBut in a site like that,\nwhat I can do is I can move my tunnel so\n\n152\n00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.450\nthat it terminates on the firewall.\n\n153\n00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.670\nAnd by terminating on the firewall,\nwhat's gonna happen\n\n154\n00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:54.890\nis that the firewall knows that any data\nthat needs to go to the headquarters,\n\n155\n00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.160\ncan be sent right across this tunnel.\n\n156\n00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.780\nThese machines,\nthese three work stations and\n\n157\n00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.940\nthis server, they don't even\nknow the VPN tunnel exists.\n\n158\n00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.350\nThey hit the firewall,\nthey cross the tunnel,\n\n159\n00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.400\nand they get dumped off into\nthe headquarters network.\n\n160\n00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.150\nI now have a secure connection.\n\n161\n00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.270\nAnd that's great for\n\n162\n00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.360\nsetting up branch offices where you\nhave replicated servers, right?\n\n163\n00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.710\nIf I'm running the Active Directory\ndomain controller, right, I've got an AD,\n\n164\n00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.400\nI need people to authenticate,\n\n165\n00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.930\nI probably want a domain controller\nout here at the branch also.\n\n166\n00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.117\nOr, if I have a file server,\n\n167\n00:08:24.117 --> 00:08:27.086\nI might be replicating files, so\nthat people can access them locally,\n\n168\n00:08:27.086 --> 00:08:29.823\nwhich is gonna be much faster than\naccessing it via the Internet.\n\n169\n00:08:29.823 --> 00:08:34.132\nAnd, at the headquarters,\nI might choose to move that VPN tunnel so\n\n170\n00:08:34.132 --> 00:08:36.936\nthat it terminates on\nthe firewall as well.\n\n171\n00:08:36.936 --> 00:08:40.851\nAnd now even the headquarters machines\ndon't know that there is a VPN tunnel in\n\n172\n00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:44.473\nplace that instead they're communicating\nright across the network and\n\n173\n00:08:44.473 --> 00:08:47.441\nthey just think that's it's\nhappening automatically but\n\n174\n00:08:47.441 --> 00:08:50.726\nin the background it's actually\nbeing encrypted inside along.\n\n175\n00:08:50.726 --> 00:08:54.235\nAnd in these scenarios you don't use L2TP,\nPPTP,\n\n176\n00:08:54.235 --> 00:08:57.810\nSSTP those all are work\nstation types things.\n\n177\n00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.900\nHere you're gonna use IPSec.\n\n178\n00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.020\nIPSec is Internet Protocol Security.\n\n179\n00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.984\nAnd it is a framework of protocols\nthat allows you to encrypt every\n\n180\n00:09:07.984 --> 00:09:12.601\nsingle packet that you send as\npart of a TCP/IP or a UDP/IP.\n\n181\n00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:16.442\nYou can encrypt the whole darn thing and\nsend it along.\n\n182\n00:09:16.442 --> 00:09:18.490\nIt can secure any protocol.\n\n183\n00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.050\nAs a result, not only does it get\nused on wide area networks like this\n\n184\n00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.670\nyou can use it on internal networks, too.\n\n185\n00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.500\nImagine you're the hospital and\nyou've got servers and\n\n186\n00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.460\nyou're moving patient medical\nrecords between servers.\n\n187\n00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.420\nWell, there's a lot of people on that\nnetwork and potentially somebody could\n\n188\n00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.920\nbe doing a eavesdropping attack and\nrecording packets.\n\n189\n00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.090\nI might want to encrypt traffic\nbetween servers right here on my own\n\n190\n00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:46.460\nnetwork to guarantee that data\nis maintained safe and intact.\n\n191\n00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.570\nSo if I want that I can run\nIPSec on my own network, right.\n\n192\n00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.750\nBetween my machines and secure everything.\n\n193\n00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:57.490\nSo it's a very flexible protocol and\nit is a whole suite of protocols.\n\n194\n00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.660\nI call it a protocol,\nI shouldn't have done that.\n\n195\n00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.170\nIPSec is a framework.\n\n196\n00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.630\nIt's made up of an encryption protocol,\n\n197\n00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:07.330\na hashing algorithm,\na key exchange protocol.\n\n198\n00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.822\nYou stack all these in together and\nthat creates an IPSec section.\n\n199\n00:10:11.822 --> 00:10:14.800\nIPSec is really a method of\nnegotiating out that security.\n\n200\n00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.600\nEvery firewall supports it.\n\n201\n00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.740\nMost server operating systems support\nit so, Windows, Linux, Mac OS,\n\n202\n00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.970\nthey all support IP Where they can encrypt\nevery single thing that moves in and\n\n203\n00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:25.830\nout of those servers.\n\n204\n00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:26.720\nA great way to protect your data.\n\n205\n00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:29.560\nAll right.\n\n206\n00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.090\nSome of the other things that\nwe have available to us.\n\n207\n00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.990\nVLANs.\n\n208\n00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.660\nVLANs are virtual local area networks.\n\n209\n00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.670\nI know we can't really see here, but if\nyou were to look at the ITProTV network,\n\n210\n00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:44.460\nwe actually have one really big HP\npro curve switch over here, and\n\n211\n00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:48.500\nit's got I can't even remember,\n180 ports on it, I think.\n\n212\n00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.450\nIt's got 180 ports on it and\nit handles all the network jacks for\n\n213\n00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:53.070\nthe entire building.\n\n214\n00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.920\nAll the network jacks are run\nright back into that switch.\n\n215\n00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.150\nNot the entire, half the building.\n\n216\n00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.340\nHalf of the building is on this switch,\nthe other half is on a different switch.\n\n217\n00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.490\nSo, we get 180 ports over here though,\nthat are fully populated.\n\n218\n00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.560\nNow, does that mean that every network\njack is connected to every other one.\n\n219\n00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.190\nIf I plug a laptop into\none do I see them all?\n\n220\n00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:13.690\nNormally yes,\nnormally you have big flat Layer2 network.\n\n221\n00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:18.720\nBut with VLANs, Virtual Local Area\nNetworks, you can divide up the switch and\n\n222\n00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.220\nyou can say here is 24 port blade.\n\n223\n00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.760\nI'm gonna set the first\n12 Ports on one VLAN and\n\n224\n00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.020\nthe second 12 Ports on another VLAN.\n\n225\n00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.918\nWhen you do that now they are separate,\nthey are isolated.\n\n226\n00:11:30.918 --> 00:11:34.700\nWhen you plug machines in, don't think\nthat they are in two completely different\n\n227\n00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:40.960\nswitches, and we leverage VLANs a lot\nespecially when it comes to servers,\n\n228\n00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.460\nbecause you want to enforce\nsecurity on your network.\n\n229\n00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:50.160\nAnd if your servers are on the same\nnetwork as your workstations,\n\n230\n00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.190\nthe workstations can talk\ndirectly to the server.\n\n231\n00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:56.060\nSo, the only place you can\nenforce security at that point\n\n232\n00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.060\nis on the server, itself.\n\n233\n00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.370\nThe client can sit there and\n\n234\n00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:04.890\nattack the server all day long because\nthey have direct access to the server.\n\n235\n00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.910\nBut if I use VLANs,\nI can divide my network up.\n\n236\n00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:13.170\nI can have my servers on one network, and\nall my workstations on another network.\n\n237\n00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.130\nNow in order to cross between the\nnetworks, we gotta go through a router.\n\n238\n00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:19.460\nNow that might be a physical router,\nor it might a Layer 3 switch,\n\n239\n00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.722\nwhich is what we have.\n\n240\n00:12:20.722 --> 00:12:23.570\nA Layer3 switch is a switch that\nhas a router built into it.\n\n241\n00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.280\nAnd so it can route between the VLANs.\n\n242\n00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.580\nBy doing that, we now have a filter point.\n\n243\n00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:34.400\nYou can filter traffic as it's being\nrouted, and we're gonna talk about access\n\n244\n00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.620\ncontrol lists later on, but,\nto keep it kind of short,\n\n245\n00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.900\nan ACL is really just a list of who's\nallowed through, and who isn't.\n\n246\n00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.240\nIf I have a file server set up that's\ndoing FTP, I wanna allow people to connect\n\n247\n00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.670\nto it on ports 20 and 21, should people\nbe able to connect to it on port 80?\n\n248\n00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:51.530\nNo.\n\n249\n00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.230\nIt's a file server not a web server so\n\n250\n00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:57.930\nat that routing point I can\nblock access to port 80.\n\n251\n00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:01.050\nI can put a ACL,\nAccess Control List in this and\n\n252\n00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:06.260\nsays allow traffic on port 2021,\nblock traffic on every other port.\n\n253\n00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.670\nNow if I'm a lazy sysadmin and\nI use a default install of Centas and\n\n254\n00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:14.540\nit's got a web server up and\nrunning on it and I've set it for FTP and\n\n255\n00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.740\nFTP is working fine, I don't have to worry\nabout people attacking the web server\n\n256\n00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.070\ncuz they can't even get to it.\n\n257\n00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.960\nWe've set filtration point.\n\n258\n00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.340\n&gt;&gt; Don is it safe to assume that\nif you need Layer3 technologies to\n\n259\n00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.100\nallow the two VLANs to communicate,\n\n260\n00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.470\nthen just like a router too, broadcast\ncommunication is gonna be isolated to\n\n261\n00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:34.930\neach VLAN Broadcast communications aren't\ngonna traverse the interfaces, either?\n\n262\n00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly right,\nyou're just gonna have unicast.\n\n263\n00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.680\nAnd we usually worry about that in terms\nof performance, we're reducing the amount\n\n264\n00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.940\nof broadcast that the server sees,\nso that's gonna improve performance.\n\n265\n00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.530\nBut here it's more like\nprotecting from attacks.\n\n266\n00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.704\nWhen you at exploration attack, I see the\nnetwork I'm, on, I need to explore it and\n\n267\n00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:52.050\nfind out what's out there,\nand do a reconnaissance.\n\n268\n00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.230\nAnd so I might send a broad\nping just to see who responds.\n\n269\n00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.020\nWhen other servers are on\na different network.\n\n270\n00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.965\nSo I can't send a broadcast based\nping to that other networks,\n\n271\n00:13:59.965 --> 00:14:01.810\nthe router won't forward it.\n\n272\n00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.835\nSo that helps to protect and\nsecure our systems.\n\n273\n00:14:04.835 --> 00:14:08.410\nVLANs are another great technologt that's\navailable just dividing up your physical\n\n274\n00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.010\nswitch into virtual switches.\n\n275\n00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:13.410\nYou can achieve the same thing if you\njust bought a bunch of physical switches.\n\n276\n00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.700\nBut it gets expensive fast.\n\n277\n00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.800\nFor us, we have that one big switch, and\nit's got, what do we have, 11 VLANs now?\n\n278\n00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.050\n11 or 12 VLANs in that thing,\nwhere we've created these partitions\n\n279\n00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.060\nhere inside of the studios to\nseparate out the various traffic.\n\n280\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.850\nSo definitely another technology.\n\n281\n00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.800\nAnd following that same idea with VLANs,\n\n282\n00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.390\nthere's other things that we\nmight want to separate also.\n\n283\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:39.080\nFor example, if I have servers that\nI'm gonna be exposing to the Internet.\n\n284\n00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.310\nWhen you look at my diagram you'll notice\nthat I got some servers kind of cordoned\n\n285\n00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.130\noff over here, right.\n\n286\n00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:45.680\nI've got stuff like my domain controller,\n\n287\n00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.260\nmy certificate of authority on\nthe regular headquarters network.\n\n288\n00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.826\nBut, then I've got the DMZ and there's\nthese dash lines kind of running around\n\n289\n00:14:52.826 --> 00:14:57.120\nthe edge here and the server for\nwhere the RAS are in that, okay.\n\n290\n00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.080\nWhat that is, is a demilitarized zone.\n\n291\n00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.220\nAnd I know I talked a little bit\nabout that in the last episode, but\n\n292\n00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:08.570\nyou can take systems and split them off\ninto a separate network, usually a VLAN.\n\n293\n00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.250\nBecause you might wanna\nhave higher security, or\n\n294\n00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.420\nlower security on these\nthan your other devices.\n\n295\n00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.300\nI don't want anyone on\nthe Internet being able to get\n\n296\n00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.790\nto my domain controller, right?\n\n297\n00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.290\nIf they can get at the domain controller,\nthey can start to do brute force attacks,\n\n298\n00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:22.610\nand try to figure out passwords, and\n\n299\n00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.960\nget access to data I don't\nwant them to have access to.\n\n300\n00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.100\nBut I do want them to be able\nto get to the web server.\n\n301\n00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.290\nI need them to view our website so they\ncan come and buy stuff, right, otherwise,\n\n302\n00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:32.660\nthe company goes out of business.\n\n303\n00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.620\nSo, the web server needs to\nbe exposed to the Internet,\n\n304\n00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.420\nThe domain controller doesn't.\n\n305\n00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:41.860\nSo by isolating the web server into a DMZ,\n\n306\n00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:46.150\nI can provide the Internet\naccess to that web server.\n\n307\n00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.750\nAnd I can block the Internet\naccess to the rest of my network.\n\n308\n00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:53.210\nThe DMZ is probably the most\ncommon example of that but\n\n309\n00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:55.600\nit doesn't just have to be a DMZ,\nit can be any number of things.\n\n310\n00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.210\nYou'll hear about companies that\nhave intranets and extranets, right.\n\n311\n00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.670\nIntranet, that's just your internal\nnetwork, it's your own systems, right,\n\n312\n00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:06.110\nyou probably have a web server setup for\nyour internal people only.\n\n313\n00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.850\nAn extranet is like a website that's not\n\n314\n00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:15.240\navailable to the public but\nis available to certain external people.\n\n315\n00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.250\nAnd we normally see this when we have\nbusinesses that we've partnered with.\n\n316\n00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:22.030\nSo maybe you've teamed up with some\nother business in whatever your\n\n317\n00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.190\nmarket is that you're in.\n\n318\n00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.150\nSo maybe you're an insurance company, and\n\n319\n00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.230\nyou've teamed up with\nanother insurance company.\n\n320\n00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:32.020\nAnd so you might have a special website\navailable with resources just for\n\n321\n00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.500\nthat other company.\n\n322\n00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.980\nSo now they can come in and access\nthat site and view the information but\n\n323\n00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:38.360\nthe general public can't.\n\n324\n00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.520\nYou'll probably want to isolate that so\nyou can apply restrictions and\n\n325\n00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.290\nsay only the IP addresses of my business\npartner are allowed to come in and\n\n326\n00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.960\naccess this site and\nnot the rest of the world.\n\n327\n00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.040\nWe restrict And\nreduce the exposure on that so\n\n328\n00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.920\nwe get it to where we just have\nthe information on there that we need.\n\n329\n00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.235\nAll right, those are all different\nsecurity concepts that we need to be aware\n\n330\n00:16:58.235 --> 00:16:59.826\nof and it's all on the network side.\n\n331\n00:16:59.826 --> 00:17:03.582\nAnd so If you're a sys install of Centas\nsysadmin and I know what you are thinking,\n\n332\n00:17:03.582 --> 00:17:04.791\nwhy do I need to know this?\n\n333\n00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:08.196\nIt all goes back to something I\nmentioned in one of the first episodes,\n\n334\n00:17:08.196 --> 00:17:10.530\nyou might not be the one\nthat's applying this.\n\n335\n00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.700\nBut you need to know to ask for\nit, to say, hey,\n\n336\n00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.890\nI'm about to publish a web server and\nwe're gonna expose it to the network.\n\n337\n00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:17.860\nDo we have a DMZ?\n\n338\n00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.050\nTalk to the network admins and say hey,\nif we don't, we need to create one.\n\n339\n00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:24.180\nOr can I get this server put int he DMZ,\nand here's the ports that I\n\n340\n00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:28.050\nneed the public to get to, and here's\nwhat I want internal people to get to.\n\n341\n00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.240\nWe need to know enough to\nhave those conversations, and\n\n342\n00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.630\nunderstanding what technology\nis available is how we do that.\n\n343\n00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.490\nSo that's why it's important that we know\nwhen it's why CompTIA wants to make sure\n\n344\n00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:36.930\nthat you know it also.\n\n345\n00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.710\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, a lot of great\ninformation on network security,\n\n346\n00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:43.410\ndefinitely quite a few considerations,\nwhether it's in the real world or\n\n347\n00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.110\non the exam.\n\n348\n00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.600\nNow, it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode, Don.\n\n349\n00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.160\nBut before we do, do you have\nany parting words when it comes\n\n350\n00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.460\nto network security and\nany additional considerations?\n\n351\n00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.240\n&gt;&gt; Network security is kind\nof a pain in the butt.\n\n352\n00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.150\nIt makes your work harder, it really does.\n\n353\n00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:58.590\nIt makes things take longer\nthan they should, but\n\n354\n00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.180\nyou don't want to be one of those\ncompanies that has to send out a letter to\n\n355\n00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.390\nall of your customers saying hey\nour database got compromised.\n\n356\n00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.370\nSo all that extra work you put in now\n\n357\n00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.000\nis saving you from that debacle\nlater on down the road.\n\n358\n00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.840\nSo take the time, make sure you do it\nright And always check, verify that you're\n\n359\n00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.670\nmaintaining those security practices\nmonth after month, year after year.\n\n360\n00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:23.290\nCuz it's easy for people to let things\nslip, right to weaken security while their\n\n361\n00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:24.870\ntroubleshooting it and\nforget to put it back.\n\n362\n00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.710\nSo that's all staff that we\nneed to keep our eyes on.\n\n363\n00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:31.000\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, as always we appreciate\nyou being here in the studio with us and\n\n364\n00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.040\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching,\nsigning up for

00:00:12.044\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:14.660\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another exciting\nepisode here at IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.470\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.370\nAnd in today's episode, we're continuing\nthrough our CompTIA Server+ SK0004\n\n7\n00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.090\ncertification, if I can get all that out.\n\n8\n00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.580\nAnd here to join us in the studios\ntoday is none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.740\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.720\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing just well, Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.490\nReady to dive right back into Server+.\n\n12\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.870\nIn this episode, we are talking\nabout secure storage disposal.\n\n13\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.630\nThat's right,\nwe're chucking storage in the trash today.\n\n14\n00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.520\nAnd that's probably a good way to start.\n\n15\n00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.460\nAll right, because throwing storage in\nthe trash is something we all have to\n\n16\n00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.460\ndo eventually.\n\n17\n00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.700\nHard drives get old or whatever storage\nmedia does get old, it gets aged.\n\n18\n00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.610\nIt has to be replaced.\n\n19\n00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.140\nAnd what do you do with the old\nstuff after you've replaced it?\n\n20\n00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.550\nGenerally you throw it away.\n\n21\n00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.600\nProblem is, we've got data on it.\n\n22\n00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.460\nIf you have data that's still on that\ndisk and you throw it away, well,\n\n23\n00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.318\nthe odds are it's going to go to\nthe landfill, it's gonna get buried,\n\n24\n00:01:04.318 --> 00:01:07.740\nit's never going to get seen again and\nthat's that, right?\n\n25\n00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.490\nBut, there's always the possibility\nthat someone could intercept that drive,\n\n26\n00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.370\ntake it, hook it up to their own system,\nand recover your data off of it.\n\n27\n00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.760\nAnd you've potentially leaked out\ninformation from your company and\n\n28\n00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.820\nyou don't even know it because\nyou've thrown the disk away.\n\n29\n00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.690\nIf somebody broke into\nyour data center and\n\n30\n00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.920\nstole a hard drive right out of\nthe server, you'd know it, right?\n\n31\n00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.790\nThat server's not booting up, or it's\nservices aren't working, you would know.\n\n32\n00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.150\nBut if somebody steals a hard drive\nyou threw away, you'd have no idea.\n\n33\n00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.260\nAnd so we've got to be really\nprotective of how that data is handled\n\n34\n00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.640\nto make sure that when we dispose of our\nstorage it's done in a secure manner\n\n35\n00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.390\nwhere somebody else can't\nretrieve our information.\n\n36\n00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.910\nNow, the key thing about\nsecure storage disposal,\n\n37\n00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.880\nis that in your planning for it you should\nalways assume that your storage is going\n\n38\n00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.070\nto be disposed of improperly, right?\n\n39\n00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.190\nJust assume that it's\nnot gonna happen right.\n\n40\n00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.880\nBecause you're setting it up today.\n\n41\n00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.250\nIt might be somebody\nelse that disposes of it.\n\n42\n00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.280\nOr it might be a scenario where you have\nto trust somebody else to dispose of it.\n\n43\n00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.080\nLet me give you an example of that.\n\n44\n00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.680\nAmazon web services,\nMicrosoft Azure or Google Cloud.\n\n45\n00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.180\nAll these cloud services.\n\n46\n00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.460\nI could go to any one of them and\nI can spin up a server right now.\n\n47\n00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.470\nI can spin up an Oracle database and\n\n48\n00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.370\nI can load all of my financial data\nright into that Oracle database.\n\n49\n00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.960\nAnd when I'm done with it,\nI can delete the virtual machine.\n\n50\n00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.660\nAnd Google, or Amazon, or Microsoft\nwill say, okay, we deleted your data,\n\n51\n00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.250\nit's all good.\n\n52\n00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.130\nDid they?\n\n53\n00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.310\nI don't know.\n\n54\n00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.280\nWho's the person who was responsible for\nerasing your VM?\n\n55\n00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.580\nDid they do it securely?\n\n56\n00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.180\nI don't know.\n\n57\n00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.900\nI hope they did.\n\n58\n00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.570\nThey say they did, it said right there\non the webpage, but I don't know.\n\n59\n00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.270\nAnd that's not a good way to secure your\ndata, to not know, you need to know.\n\n60\n00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.160\nSo the best way to plan for\ndisposal is to just plan for\n\n61\n00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.790\nthe disposal to be done wrong.\n\n62\n00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.810\nSo assuming it's done wrong,\nlet's just assume the worst.\n\n63\n00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.910\nThe worst case scenario is I have\na server I don't need anymore, and so\n\n64\n00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.100\nsomebody takes it and sells it on Ebay.\n\n65\n00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.880\nAnd if somebody buys it on Ebay,\nthey're gonna use it.\n\n66\n00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.950\nThey're gonna take that server and use it.\n\n67\n00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.240\nSo they're gonna fire it up,\nand there's my data.\n\n68\n00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.100\nThat's the worst case scenario.\n\n69\n00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.270\nSo how can I make it so\n\n70\n00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.630\nthat when they fire that server up,\nthat they're not going to have my data.\n\n71\n00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.100\nThat they're not gonna be\nable to see that information.\n\n72\n00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.840\nThe number one best way to do\nit is to encrypt your data.\n\n73\n00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.290\nWell, I guess the best way would be to\nnot have data in the first place, but\n\n74\n00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.820\nthat's not really an option for\nmost of us.\n\n75\n00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.440\nSo, encrypting the data.\n\n76\n00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.160\nNow, when it comes to encrypting the data,\nthere's a few different choices we've got.\n\n77\n00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.820\nFor example,\n\n78\n00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.650\nwe can encrypt individual files or\nwe can encrypt entire hard drives.\n\n79\n00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.400\nEncrypting individual files is\nnice cuz it's a little bit faster.\n\n80\n00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.450\nAnd you just encrypt what's sensitive,\nright.\n\n81\n00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.330\nThe negative side of encrypting individual\nfiles is it's easy to forget that yeah,\n\n82\n00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.500\nI might have secured 10 or\n20 of my secure files, and\n\n83\n00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.790\nthen I add another one a year later and\nI forget about it.\n\n84\n00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.060\nAnd so I don't encrypt it.\n\n85\n00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.330\nOr sometimes it's hard to tell\nwhat's encrypted and what isn't.\n\n86\n00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.190\nThings get mixed up, right.\n\n87\n00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.130\nSo that's kind of the challenge\nin doing individual files.\n\n88\n00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.950\nIf you do the whole disk, now,\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n89\n00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.080\nI've encrypted the entire hard drive.\n\n90\n00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.810\nSo, if I put a file on there, it's\nencrypted, if I take a file off, it's not.\n\n91\n00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.770\nThere we go.\n\n92\n00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.780\nI don't have to remember that at all.\n\n93\n00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.540\nBut, we take a little bit\nof a performance hit.\n\n94\n00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.880\nBecause every time we write to the hard\ndrive we've got to encrypt the data.\n\n95\n00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.400\nAnd every time we read from the hard\ndrive, we have to decrypt the data.\n\n96\n00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.490\nSo, we're trading performance for\nsecurity.\n\n97\n00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.320\nOr vice versa, we're trading security for\n\n98\n00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.120\nperformance by choosing\none over the other.\n\n99\n00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.650\nNow most modern operating systems\nsupport full disk encryption.\n\n100\n00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.250\nSo you've got the ability to turn it on.\n\n101\n00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.490\nMost modern operating systems support\nindividual file encryption also, but\n\n102\n00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.040\nyou've got to turn it on.\n\n103\n00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.410\nThere's only a few operating systems\nthat actually encrypt by default.\n\n104\n00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.950\nMost of them don't,\nincluding Windows Server.\n\n105\n00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.420\nLike Windows Server doesn't\nencrypt by default.\n\n106\n00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.790\nYou can turn it on if you want,\nbut it doesn't encrypt by default.\n\n107\n00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.660\nLinux distros?\n\n108\n00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.910\nI don't know a single Linux\ndistro that encrypts by default.\n\n109\n00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.040\nThey've all got the option, right,\nI'm not saying they're bad.\n\n110\n00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.850\nI'm saying they give you the option,\nright.\n\n111\n00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:08.940\nBut they don't by default.\n\n112\n00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.910\nAnd the reason they don't is they know\nthat everybody wants performance.\n\n113\n00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.090\nAnd as long as you're doing your\nphysical security, right, and\n\n114\n00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.900\nyou're disposing of your drives properly,\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n115\n00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.850\nYou don't need full-disk encryption.\n\n116\n00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.710\nSo that's why it's off by default.\n\n117\n00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.830\nBut if you know you can't\ntrust your environment,\n\n118\n00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.820\nif you know you can't trust these\ndrives will be disposed properly,\n\n119\n00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.860\nthen you need to make sure\nyou can encrypt, all right?\n\n120\n00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.270\nSo let's take a look at some of\nthe different ways we can do this.\n\n121\n00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.270\nI'm just gonna show you a few here.\n\n122\n00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.756\nOn the exam, they don't really nickle and\n\n123\n00:05:35.756 --> 00:05:37.334\ndime you on actually\nconfiguring the stuff.\n\n124\n00:05:37.334 --> 00:05:41.170\nBut just to show you, like here on my Mac.\n\n125\n00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.920\nOn a Mac you can do full disk encryption.\n\n126\n00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.660\nIt has what's called FileVault, but\n\n127\n00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.870\nI can encrypt individual files\nusing third party software.\n\n128\n00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.570\nAnd this is true on Linux and\nWindows also.\n\n129\n00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.490\nOne of the most popular ways to encrypt\nindividual files is through using\n\n130\n00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.340\na software called PGP.\n\n131\n00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.930\nPGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy.\n\n132\n00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.720\nAnd it's an open sourced suite of software\nthat lets you encrypt and decrypt files.\n\n133\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.550\nSo, I have a little document sitting here,\nthis test document.\n\n134\n00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:14.130\nAnd if I want to encrypt it, I can fire\nup Open PGP and I can encrypt the file.\n\n135\n00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.630\nSee where I can digitally sign it?\n\n136\n00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.300\nSigning a file is nice if I just want\npeople to know whether it's been\n\n137\n00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.570\ntampered with or not, but\nit doesn't actually encrypt it.\n\n138\n00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.950\nSo I can come in here and\nI can encrypt the file.\n\n139\n00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.710\nAnd when I do that, it's gonna launch\nOpen PGP, which is what I'm using or\n\n140\n00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.840\nGPG services.\n\n141\n00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.140\nAnd I can pick what key I\nwant to encrypt it with.\n\n142\n00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.840\nI'm gonna encrypt it with my key, right?\n\n143\n00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.640\nSo here's the Don Pezet key, I'm gonna\nchoose it, and I'm gonna encrypt it.\n\n144\n00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.855\nNow, I can encrypt it with a password or\nI can encrypt it with my key and\n\n145\n00:06:43.855 --> 00:06:45.780\nthat's' what I'm gonna do,\nis encrypt it with my key.\n\n146\n00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.160\nNow, when I do that,\nI'm encrypting it with a particular key.\n\n147\n00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.970\nAnd anybody who receives this\nneeds to be able to decrypt it.\n\n148\n00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.020\nWell, when you encrypt something,\nyou encrypt with a public key.\n\n149\n00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.310\nAnd then they decrypt using a private key.\n\n150\n00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.420\nIf I encrypt this with my private key,\nonly I can decrypt it and\n\n151\n00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.390\nthat's what I want, okay.\n\n152\n00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.670\nIf I were to encrypt this with my key and\n\n153\n00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.450\nsend it to Wes,\nWes couldn't open it my key.\n\n154\n00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.380\nI would need Wes to\nsend me his public key.\n\n155\n00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.200\nAnd then I can encrypt it with Wes'\npublic key and send him the file.\n\n156\n00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.390\nAnd he could decrypt it\nusing his private key.\n\n157\n00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.550\nSo if I'm transmitting it to somebody\nelse I need to encrypt it with their key.\n\n158\n00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.310\nBut if I'm just encrypting it for me, I\ndon't want anybody else to get into this.\n\n159\n00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.320\nI can choose my key and I can come\nin here and tell it to encrypt it.\n\n160\n00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.670\nAnd so now it's going to encrypt it,\nit's finished, and\n\n161\n00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.880\nnow over here I can see I've\ngot two different files.\n\n162\n00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.490\nI've got my test document which is an RTF.\n\n163\n00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:51.913\nAnd now I've got Test Document.rtf.gpg,\nthe encrypted version of that file.\n\n164\n00:07:51.913 --> 00:07:55.859\nNow the negative is, any time I open this,\nI've got to decrypt it first.\n\n165\n00:07:55.859 --> 00:07:57.865\nThen I can work with it, and\nthen I have to re-encrypt it.\n\n166\n00:07:57.865 --> 00:08:00.489\nIt's a manual process,\nthat's the biggest negative.\n\n167\n00:08:00.489 --> 00:08:04.030\nOf using individual file\nencryption like this.\n\n168\n00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.450\nThere are some vendors like Microsoft\nthat have tried to make it easier.\n\n169\n00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.890\nBut they don't support\nsharing it with other people,\n\n170\n00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.457\nbecause then you've gotta use their key,\nand they don't have a key exchange.\n\n171\n00:08:13.457 --> 00:08:16.882\nGPG does, it's got a little key exchange\nwe can do to get somebody else's key to\n\n172\n00:08:16.882 --> 00:08:18.570\nencrypt and send to them.\n\n173\n00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:23.438\nBut for example, if was in\nMicrosoft Windows, I could create,\n\n174\n00:08:23.438 --> 00:08:25.977\nhere I'll create Don's Stuff.\n\n175\n00:08:25.977 --> 00:08:30.905\nSo I'm going to create a folder,\nand in that folder I will create\n\n176\n00:08:30.905 --> 00:08:35.590\na text document which I'll call\nMy Test Document all right.\n\n177\n00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.230\nAnd if I pull up\nthe properties on that file.\n\n178\n00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.860\nIt can be read only, it can be hidden.\n\n179\n00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.760\nIf I go to advance I can encrypt\nthe contents of the file.\n\n180\n00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.850\nJust a little check mark, right?\n\n181\n00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.790\nSo I hit the check mark, it's asking\nif I wanna encrypt just the file or\n\n182\n00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:51.710\nthe entire folder.\n\n183\n00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.872\nI'm just gonna do the file.\n\n184\n00:08:53.872 --> 00:08:57.600\nAnd now that that's done, it's encrypted.\n\n185\n00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.390\nNow as end user,\nhow do I know it's encrypted?\n\n186\n00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.600\nWell It doesn't look much different,\ndoes it?\n\n187\n00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.490\nIf I zoom way in,\nthe little lock on that icon.\n\n188\n00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.030\nBut it's so stinking small, and\n\n189\n00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.680\nit's yellow on white, that you\ndon't even notice most of the time.\n\n190\n00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.382\nWhen I hear full resolution,\nI can barely read the filename, better yet\n\n191\n00:09:15.382 --> 00:09:16.180\nsee that icon.\n\n192\n00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.390\nBut the cool part here\nis it's all automated.\n\n193\n00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.390\nIf I open that file,\nI didn't have to decrypt it.\n\n194\n00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.090\nI just type in it, right?\n\n195\n00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.270\nAnd there it is, and when I close\nit I didn't have to re-encrypt it,\n\n196\n00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.290\nit just does it for me,\nit's all automated, so that's nice.\n\n197\n00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:35.040\nIndividual file encryption and I didn't\nhave to get involved with it, right?\n\n198\n00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.340\nSo that's a solution that works in\nthe Microsoft world, in the Linux and\n\n199\n00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.910\nMac world you have GPG,\nwhich is a little more manual.\n\n200\n00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.780\nGPG works in Windows also, so\nyou can use it everywhere.\n\n201\n00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:49.030\nAnd on those guys they would rather\nyou did full disk encryption\n\n202\n00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.550\nbecause full disk encryption you\nalso don't have to worry about but\n\n203\n00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.680\nit's only encrypted right\nthere on your drive.\n\n204\n00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.440\nIf I attach a file to an email and email\nit to somebody it's not encrypted anymore,\n\n205\n00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.738\nit was only encrypted\nwhile it was on my drive.\n\n206\n00:10:00.738 --> 00:10:03.030\nVersus GPG where I encrypt it, and\n\n207\n00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.580\nnow it's encrypted forever\nuntil somebody decrypts it.\n\n208\n00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.730\nThat GPG file is gonna be encrypted.\n\n209\n00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.340\n&gt;&gt; Don,\nwhen you mention Full Disk Encryption,\n\n210\n00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.120\nyou said File Vault\nthere in the Mac world.\n\n211\n00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.740\nIs that akin to something like for\ninstance Bit Locker in Windows?\n\n212\n00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.632\nWould they be comparative\nto the technologies even\n\n213\n00:10:16.632 --> 00:10:17.292\nthough\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n214\n00:10:17.292 --> 00:10:18.048\n&gt;&gt; Different flavors?\n\n215\n00:10:18.048 --> 00:10:20.680\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah, absolutely, and\non the Macs, you have File Vault.\n\n216\n00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.150\nOn Windows, you have Bit Locker.\n\n217\n00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.586\nIn Linux, you have LUKS, L-U-K-S.\n\n218\n00:10:24.586 --> 00:10:27.185\nEach of them are full\ndisk encryption models.\n\n219\n00:10:27.185 --> 00:10:32.604\nAnd then there's third parties out\nthere like and a few other people.\n\n220\n00:10:32.604 --> 00:10:34.980\nWhat's the Truecrypt?\n\n221\n00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.260\n&gt;&gt; Truecrypt.\n&gt;&gt; They changed their name?\n\n222\n00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:36.811\nWhat's the new name?\n\n223\n00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:37.439\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure.\n\n224\n00:10:37.439 --> 00:10:40.970\n&gt;&gt; Veracrypt, so you have VeraCrypt,\nwhich is a open source,\n\n225\n00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.040\nfull disk encryption suite.\n\n226\n00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.830\nSo there's plenty of ways to do\nfull disk encryption on a system.\n\n227\n00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.500\nAnd some of it's real easy,\nhit a check mark.\n\n228\n00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.720\nIn Windows,\nyou just launch the BitLocker wizard, and\n\n229\n00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.470\nit'll run through and encrypt it.\n\n230\n00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.644\nOther systems,\nthey just ask you during the install.\n\n231\n00:10:54.644 --> 00:10:57.546\nSo LUX,\nif any of you've watched my Red Hat shows,\n\n232\n00:10:57.546 --> 00:10:59.920\nI show how to configure LUX under Red Hat.\n\n233\n00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.399\nIt's actually quite a few steps you\nhave to go through, it's kind of a pain.\n\n234\n00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.360\nOr when you're installing your server,\n\n235\n00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.040\nit's one check mark if you do\nit during the installation.\n\n236\n00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.860\nSo for example,\nhere I've got a CentOS machine.\n\n237\n00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.540\nI know I said Red Hat, but\nCentOS is basically the same thing.\n\n238\n00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.070\nI'll start this CentOS install, and\n\n239\n00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:20.590\nas I move forward, it's gonna ask me what\nhard drive I wanna install on, right?\n\n240\n00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.940\nSo right down here,\nI've got my installation destination.\n\n241\n00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.090\nAnd when I choose that I can pick\nthe hard drive I want to install on and\n\n242\n00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.250\nmy partitioning.\n\n243\n00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:32.340\nAnd if I keep scrolling down right\noff the bottom of my screen.\n\n244\n00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.800\nEncrypt my data.\n\n245\n00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.550\nYou'll set a passphrase later.\n\n246\n00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.440\nIt's gonna encrypt the entire\nhard drive using Lux.\n\n247\n00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.370\nSo it's gonna configure all that stuff.\n\n248\n00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:44.290\nIt's like a 12-step configuration\nprocess if I do it by hand.\n\n249\n00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:45.790\nHere's just a check mark.\n\n250\n00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:49.030\nAnd so now, it's going to encrypt\nthat entire hard drive for me.\n\n251\n00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.980\nI need to remember that as\nI add more hard drives,\n\n252\n00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.130\nlike this other one over here,\nis it going to get encrypted also?\n\n253\n00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.140\nNot necessarily.\n\n254\n00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.394\nI need to double check after the install\nis done to make sure that one got\n\n255\n00:12:00.394 --> 00:12:01.175\nencrypted too.\n\n256\n00:12:01.175 --> 00:12:05.900\nSo when you pick your drives and so\non, you'll need to double check that.\n\n257\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.828\nBut I'm going to choose the encrypt and\nso now as I move forward with my\n\n258\n00:12:09.828 --> 00:12:13.419\ninstallation, it's going to ask\nme to set that pass phrase and\n\n259\n00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:16.914\nI'll need to establish some\nkind of super secure password.\n\n260\n00:12:16.914 --> 00:12:21.230\nThat [LAUGH] didn't even get the to\nbump up even one little bit.\n\n261\n00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.822\nWell, all right.\n\n262\n00:12:21.822 --> 00:12:25.448\nSo if you add enough exclamation points to\nanything, it'll eventually become secure.\n\n263\n00:12:25.448 --> 00:12:27.600\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna go weak on this one.\n\n264\n00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.699\nBut it's warning me here, you won't be\nable to switch between keyboard layouts\n\n265\n00:12:31.699 --> 00:12:33.942\nwhen you decrypt your disks after install.\n\n266\n00:12:33.942 --> 00:12:37.205\nAnd it's just telling you that that's\npart of the boot system that has be\n\n267\n00:12:37.205 --> 00:12:40.940\nunencrypted and so it secures\nthe unencrypted part so you could boot.\n\n268\n00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.890\nAnd then the rest of it will\nget encrypted and protected.\n\n269\n00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.270\nSo I'll save that passphrase.\n\n270\n00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.815\nAnd now when it does the install, it's\njust gonna go through and encrypt that for\n\n271\n00:12:49.815 --> 00:12:52.021\nme and now I don't have to worry about it,\nright?\n\n272\n00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:54.850\nIt is simple as that and\nwe'll be in business.\n\n273\n00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.820\nSo, punch in the rest of this\ndata to finish this installer.\n\n274\n00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.728\nAnd it's going to complain\nabout that being too weak.\n\n275\n00:13:04.728 --> 00:13:06.640\nWell anyhow, it's churning along.\n\n276\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.170\nNow your install may take a little longer\nbecause it's trying to encrypt the disk.\n\n277\n00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.980\nSometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.\n\n278\n00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.160\nBut once it's done it'll come up.\n\n279\n00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.900\nAnd usually once the initial\nencryption is done.\n\n280\n00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.740\nEverything else runs at regular speed and\n\n281\n00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.990\nyou can even encrypt the disk\nwhile you're using it.\n\n282\n00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.410\nIt's like with BitLocker, you can have\nthe BitLocker encryption running in\n\n283\n00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.790\nthe background while you're still using\nthe computer and making use of it.\n\n284\n00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:34.365\nSo it's pretty neat to have this and\nthe cool part here is once the entire hard\n\n285\n00:13:34.365 --> 00:13:38.671\ndrive is encrypted If somebody steals\nthis laptop and sells it on eBay.\n\n286\n00:13:38.671 --> 00:13:41.993\nOr they get the hard drives that I threw\nout from my server from the trash and\n\n287\n00:13:41.993 --> 00:13:44.730\nthey plug them in,\nthey just see encrypted data.\n\n288\n00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.850\nAnd unless they know my pass phrase,\nthey're not gonna be able to decrypt it.\n\n289\n00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.490\nAnd I can take that pass phrase and\nI can write it on a piece of paper and\n\n290\n00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:55.120\nI can lock it in a safe,\nput it in a vault, somewhere off line.\n\n291\n00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.700\nDon't save it in a text file and stick it\non a file share, that's pointless, right?\n\n292\n00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.920\nPut in a safe, and then if you ever\nneed it, if you ever have to do trouble\n\n293\n00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.011\nshooting to recover that server,\nif it won't boot up or whatever.\n\n294\n00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:08.720\nYou can go to the safe and get that\npassword, and come in here and decrypt it.\n\n295\n00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.930\nYou shouldn't need that pass phrase again.\n\n296\n00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.910\nMost servers have a TPM in them.\n\n297\n00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.081\nA trusted platform module.\n\n298\n00:14:16.081 --> 00:14:18.770\nIn one of the episodes I showed\ngoing to Dell's website, and\n\n299\n00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.010\nwe were like shopping for\nserver, buying parts.\n\n300\n00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.950\nAnd the TPM was an optional component,\nyou want it.\n\n301\n00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.200\nJust get the TPM.\n\n302\n00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.600\nThey're a pain to add later,\nyou usually can't.\n\n303\n00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.778\nSo you might as well add\nit at purchase time.\n\n304\n00:14:28.778 --> 00:14:31.350\nAnd it usually doesn't add\nmuch to the cost, if anything.\n\n305\n00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.211\nBut what the Trusted Platform Module is,\n\n306\n00:14:33.211 --> 00:14:36.575\nis a place where this key can be stored\nencrypted right on the motherboard.\n\n307\n00:14:36.575 --> 00:14:39.825\nSo that when the system boots up,\nthe key is already there and\n\n308\n00:14:39.825 --> 00:14:43.100\nyou just boot like normal and\nyou don't even notice.\n\n309\n00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.880\nBut if somebody were to\ntake those hard drives out,\n\n310\n00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.960\nthat modules not there anymore.\n\n311\n00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.050\nAnd so now they'd have to present\nthe password which they don't have, and\n\n312\n00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:52.780\nnow they can't get in.\n\n313\n00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:59.140\nOr if they stole the whole server\nthey can't boot off of a CD because\n\n314\n00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.040\nit won't see the TPM,\nthey would have to have the pass phrase.\n\n315\n00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.576\nThey would have to boot\nfrom the hard drives,\n\n316\n00:15:04.576 --> 00:15:08.595\nwhich would load my OS which would\nrequire them to have the pass phrase.\n\n317\n00:15:08.595 --> 00:15:09.595\nOr to have a user name and\n\n318\n00:15:09.595 --> 00:15:12.300\npassword to be able to log into\nmy OS which they shouldn't have.\n\n319\n00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.222\nIf they do then they don't\nneed to steal the server,\n\n320\n00:15:14.222 --> 00:15:16.420\nthey could have gotten in anyway\nwithout even stealing it.\n\n321\n00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.260\nSo that's how we kind of make\nsure that we're set up for that.\n\n322\n00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.590\nBy having the disks encrypted,\n\n323\n00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.580\nI don't have to worry about\nhow they're disposed anymore.\n\n324\n00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.620\nI still want them to be disposed right.\n\n325\n00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:26.930\nBut I don't have to worry about it so\nmuch.\n\n326\n00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.240\nIf they're disposed improperly,\nI know my data is safe.\n\n327\n00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.010\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, as well you've talked about\nin another episode where we were talking\n\n328\n00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:34.100\nabout physical security.\n\n329\n00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.486\nYou mentioned the keys and passwords could\nbe born in the disk and stored in a safe.\n\n330\n00:15:37.486 --> 00:15:40.853\nAnother thing that you said that can be\nstored in the safe in that episode, too,\n\n331\n00:15:40.853 --> 00:15:42.426\nwas our backup, our backup medium.\n\n332\n00:15:42.426 --> 00:15:44.953\nDo we have an added layer\nof protection before they\n\n333\n00:15:44.953 --> 00:15:47.310\nget to the safe when it\ncomes to backup medium?\n\n334\n00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:48.965\nCuz we know that that's critical data, and\n\n335\n00:15:48.965 --> 00:15:51.483\nwe certainly don't want that to\nfall into just anybody's hands.\n\n336\n00:15:51.483 --> 00:15:55.416\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and one thing about backing\nup to tape, If you still back up to tape,\n\n337\n00:15:55.416 --> 00:15:58.779\nis there's no real mechanism in there for\nsetting file permissions.\n\n338\n00:15:58.779 --> 00:16:00.964\nSo if somebody gets a hold\nof your back up tape,\n\n339\n00:16:00.964 --> 00:16:02.939\nThey can read every single file on there.\n\n340\n00:16:02.939 --> 00:16:04.379\nThey don't have to have a username and\npassword.\n\n341\n00:16:04.379 --> 00:16:05.790\nIt's all right there.\n\n342\n00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.210\nSo tapes are targeted by physical\nattackers, by social engineers.\n\n343\n00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.679\nThey want to get those tapes,\ncuz it's easy for\n\n344\n00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:14.100\nthem to get all of your\ndata on their own terms.\n\n345\n00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.849\nJust at their leisure, they could be\nsitting at home running through the tapes.\n\n346\n00:16:17.849 --> 00:16:20.970\nSo we need to make sure that\ntapes are encrypted also.\n\n347\n00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:24.690\nEvery backup software these days\nthat's worth its salt has encryption\n\n348\n00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:25.872\nfunctionality in it.\n\n349\n00:16:25.872 --> 00:16:30.220\nSo there's like Symantec or\nVeritas Backup Exec, Commvault,\n\n350\n00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.176\nArcserve, they've got the option\nto encrypt the tapes.\n\n351\n00:16:34.176 --> 00:16:36.572\nSo now if somebody were to steal those\ntapes the data would be encrypted, and\n\n352\n00:16:36.572 --> 00:16:38.310\nthey wouldn't be able to recover it.\n\n353\n00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.940\nIf your software doesn't support it,\n\n354\n00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.200\nthere's physical tape drives\nthat support encryption too.\n\n355\n00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.745\nThe problem with those is if somebody\ncan get into your data center to steal\n\n356\n00:16:45.745 --> 00:16:47.483\nthe tapes,\nthey can steal the tape drive, also.\n\n357\n00:16:47.483 --> 00:16:49.750\nAnd so that kinda negates that a bit.\n\n358\n00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.480\nBut at that point [LAUGH] you've\nprobably got bigger problems,\n\n359\n00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.325\nif people are stealing tape drives\nright out of your data center.\n\n360\n00:16:55.325 --> 00:16:59.050\nBut these are things\nthat we need to secure.\n\n361\n00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:03.067\nThere's these horror stories of where\na technician, for whatever reason,\n\n362\n00:17:03.067 --> 00:17:07.471\nthe backups weren't ready when the offsite\nbackup people came to pick up the tapes.\n\n363\n00:17:07.471 --> 00:17:09.679\nAnd so they decided, well,\nwe need an offsite backup, so\n\n364\n00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:11.356\nI'll just stick them in\nthe trunk of my car.\n\n365\n00:17:11.356 --> 00:17:14.808\nAnd then their car got stolen and\nthey don't know what happened.\n\n366\n00:17:14.808 --> 00:17:17.875\nNow whoever stole the car probably\ndidn't know the tapes were there.\n\n367\n00:17:17.875 --> 00:17:21.078\nDidn't intend to read them,\nprobably had no way to read those tapes.\n\n368\n00:17:21.078 --> 00:17:25.879\nBut now, a fully unencrypted collection of\nall of that company's data was out there\n\n369\n00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:30.150\nin the wild and they had no idea where\nit was, and so what did they have to do?\n\n370\n00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:34.310\nThey had to contact all their\ncustomers and say, sorry guys,\n\n371\n00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:38.900\nwe had a data breach and it was\nan accident, it was unintentional, but\n\n372\n00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.070\nall your data's out there and\nwe don't really know where it is, sorry.\n\n373\n00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.890\nThat's not good, right?\n\n374\n00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:45.412\nSo we need to make sure\nthose tapes get encrypted.\n\n375\n00:17:45.412 --> 00:17:50.354\nNow, we wouldn't have to worry about any\nof this if we were able to guarantee that\n\n376\n00:17:50.354 --> 00:17:53.480\nour data was being properly disposed of.\n\n377\n00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.850\nSo let's talk about what I mean\nwhen I say properly disposed of.\n\n378\n00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:59.650\nWhen you take a look at something,\nlike this Windows machine, so I created\n\n379\n00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:04.410\na folder right here and I encrypted\na file in it, this Test Document.\n\n380\n00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.740\nWell, it's encrypted, so\n\n381\n00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:08.170\nI know that somebody would have\nto have my key to read it.\n\n382\n00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:13.030\nIf it wasn't encrypted, so I'm just gonna\ndecrypted it really quick, there, right?\n\n383\n00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.170\nAnd I was done with the file.\n\n384\n00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.660\nI'm not using the file any more.\n\n385\n00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.653\nSo I'm gonna delete it.\n\n386\n00:18:17.653 --> 00:18:21.999\nI'm just gonna do the old right click and\ndelete and it's gone.\n\n387\n00:18:21.999 --> 00:18:25.282\n[SOUND] I don't have that data any more,\nsafe.\n\n388\n00:18:25.282 --> 00:18:26.150\nNot really, right?\n\n389\n00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.760\nWhere did it go?\n\n390\n00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.710\nWent to my recycle bin,\nthat data is still there,\n\n391\n00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:31.640\nfully intact right on my hard drive.\n\n392\n00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.800\nIf somebody were to steal this hard drive,\n\n393\n00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.581\nthey could browse in into the recycle\nbin and they could go in and find that.\n\n394\n00:18:37.581 --> 00:18:39.981\nAnd recover that data and\nit would be trivial for\n\n395\n00:18:39.981 --> 00:18:41.727\nthem to be able to get to that data.\n\n396\n00:18:41.727 --> 00:18:47.310\nIn fact, it's harder to find the\nRecycle Bin icon than it is to recover.\n\n397\n00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:48.820\nWes, where the heck is\nthe Recycle Bin icon?\n\n398\n00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.296\n&gt;&gt; Upper left-hand corner.\n\n399\n00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:51.220\n&gt;&gt; Upper left-hand corner.\n\n400\n00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.173\n&gt;&gt; On your desktop.\n\n401\n00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:53.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right there on my giant screen.\n\n402\n00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:57.234\nAll right, so you can go right\ninto that Recycle Bin and,\n\n403\n00:18:57.234 --> 00:18:58.986\n[LAUGH] Brain freeze I guess.\n\n404\n00:18:58.986 --> 00:19:02.427\nAnd there's my Test Document right there,\nand we can recover that and\n\n405\n00:19:02.427 --> 00:19:04.170\nwe can restore it, okay?\n\n406\n00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:07.220\nSo, how do I prevent something like that?\n\n407\n00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.610\nWell, I could permanently delete it.\n\n408\n00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.346\nWhen I right clicked on it and\nwent to delete,\n\n409\n00:19:13.346 --> 00:19:17.962\nif I hold shift when I hit delete it's\ngonna permanently delete it, right?\n\n410\n00:19:17.962 --> 00:19:20.707\nAnd so then I can say, yes, and\nit's gonna permanently delete it.\n\n411\n00:19:20.707 --> 00:19:22.332\nI'm safe now, aren't I?\n\n412\n00:19:22.332 --> 00:19:24.270\n&gt;&gt; Don, help me out here.\n\n413\n00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:27.664\nDidn't that just eliminate the pointer\nin the operating system, right?\n\n414\n00:19:27.664 --> 00:19:29.460\nThe file is still technically there.\n\n415\n00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:33.101\nDidn't we just basically put the blinders\nonto the operating system and\n\n416\n00:19:33.101 --> 00:19:36.960\nnow it can't see it, it's not that\nthe drive physically can't see it.\n\n417\n00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.695\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n418\n00:19:37.695 --> 00:19:39.580\nThe data is still there.\n\n419\n00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.191\nThe file name might have\ngotten mangled a little bit.\n\n420\n00:19:41.191 --> 00:19:44.067\nCuz like what Wes said what's\nstored in the file table is gone.\n\n421\n00:19:44.067 --> 00:19:46.137\nBut the actual data, the 1s and 0s,\n\n422\n00:19:46.137 --> 00:19:50.557\nthat's still written to the physical\nmedia until it gets overwritten, right.\n\n423\n00:19:50.557 --> 00:19:53.295\nIf I start writing new data,\nthat might get overwritten.\n\n424\n00:19:53.295 --> 00:19:55.800\nBut at this very moment,\nthat file's still there.\n\n425\n00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:00.580\nAnd somebody could run undelete or\nforensic software, and recover that,\n\n426\n00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.070\nand pull that data back.\n\n427\n00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.300\nAnd that's a problem right?\n\n428\n00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.360\nThat's where somebody could recover\ndata that I think has been destroyed,\n\n429\n00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.680\nand it's not properly destroyed.\n\n430\n00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.940\nNow think about my example\nof cloud services.\n\n431\n00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.658\nSo I'm running a cloud web server,\nand I delete that server.\n\n432\n00:20:15.658 --> 00:20:19.770\nWell, Amazon is gonna go and destroy\nthe hard drives that it was running on.\n\n433\n00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.400\nThey're gonna erase them and\ngive them to another customer.\n\n434\n00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.399\nSo who is that other customer?\n\n435\n00:20:24.399 --> 00:20:25.945\nI don't know.\n\n436\n00:20:25.945 --> 00:20:26.850\nThey don't tell me.\n\n437\n00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.280\nThat's none of my business.\n\n438\n00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.110\nBut it is my business cuz\nthat's where my data was.\n\n439\n00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:34.280\nHow do I know that it was properly erased?\n\n440\n00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.984\nBecause somebody could be out\nthere spinning up VMs and\n\n441\n00:20:36.984 --> 00:20:40.580\nthen just loading up forensic software\non there and scanning the drive.\n\n442\n00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.960\nTo see if they can find\nother customer data, right.\n\n443\n00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.018\nSo if that data was encrypted,\nI wouldn't have to worry about it.\n\n444\n00:20:46.018 --> 00:20:47.728\nThe data is gone, I'm safe.\n\n445\n00:20:47.728 --> 00:20:49.387\nIf the data wasn't encrypted,\n\n446\n00:20:49.387 --> 00:20:52.587\npotentially somebody could be\nrecovering my data right now.\n\n447\n00:20:52.587 --> 00:20:59.129\nSo to get around that, we need to make\nsure our drives are properly disposed of.\n\n448\n00:20:59.129 --> 00:21:03.275\nWhat I just showed you, that delete,\nthat's what's called a soft wipe.\n\n449\n00:21:03.275 --> 00:21:06.463\nA soft wipe means, I think it's gone.\n\n450\n00:21:06.463 --> 00:21:10.063\nAnd it's gone enough if I'm\ngonna keep using the server.\n\n451\n00:21:10.063 --> 00:21:13.129\nBut it's not gone enough if I'm\ngonna give it to somebody else.\n\n452\n00:21:13.129 --> 00:21:16.406\nIf I'm gonna give it to somebody else,\nI need to do a hard wipe.\n\n453\n00:21:16.406 --> 00:21:19.683\nA hard wipe is where I delete\nit just like that, but\n\n454\n00:21:19.683 --> 00:21:25.180\nthen I overwrite the file to guarantee\nthat the bits are no longer there.\n\n455\n00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.640\nNow the challenge is that it is a magnetic\nmedium, if it's a spinning disk.\n\n456\n00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.609\nIf it's a flash media, there it's\ntechnically still magnetic one way or\n\n457\n00:21:32.609 --> 00:21:36.065\nanother, but the 1s and\n0s are being burned into memory in a way\n\n458\n00:21:36.065 --> 00:21:39.923\nthat stays there even when it loses\npower so that data can be retrieved.\n\n459\n00:21:39.923 --> 00:21:42.060\nSo I need to make sure\nit gets overwritten.\n\n460\n00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.472\nI can't just weigh it and say, well I\nthink I've written enough to the drive\n\n461\n00:21:44.472 --> 00:21:45.805\nthat it's probably overwritten by now.\n\n462\n00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:47.400\nCuz you can't guarantee that.\n\n463\n00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.180\nSo I need to guarantee\nit gets overwritten.\n\n464\n00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.800\nAnd just deleting it that way,\nthat's not good enough.\n\n465\n00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.000\nAll right, so\nwe need to go a step further.\n\n466\n00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.780\nAnd there's plenty of people out\nthere that are releasing software\n\n467\n00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.840\nthat lets you do a manual\noverwrite of the sectors.\n\n468\n00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.296\nSome operating systems have it built in.\n\n469\n00:22:03.296 --> 00:22:08.325\nIf you have a Mac OS server, when you\nfire up your disk utility to erase\n\n470\n00:22:08.325 --> 00:22:14.180\na hard drive which, it's not gonna let me\nerase my Main OS is it [LAUGH], no, no.\n\n471\n00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:18.040\nBut anyhow, when you go to erase it,\nthey have a secure erase where it will\n\n472\n00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.780\noverwrite the drive more than once to make\nsure that it gets through everything.\n\n473\n00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.310\nBy default it does it once.\n\n474\n00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.450\nIf you don't have something like that,\n\n475\n00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:25.990\nlike if I was gonna do\nthis Windows machine or\n\n476\n00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:29.250\nwhatever, I could use software like DBAN.\n\n477\n00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.760\nDBAN is Darik's Boot and Nuke,\nit's been around for a long, long time.\n\n478\n00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:36.410\nIt's an ISO image that you boot up and\nit takes you into this software.\n\n479\n00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:38.600\nIt's not too flashy, text based,\n\n480\n00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.810\ncuz they didn't want to fuss\naround with drivers too much.\n\n481\n00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:44.950\nIt'll boot up and find your hard drives\nand it'll allow you to erase them.\n\n482\n00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.390\nAnd to do a secure erase, and\nthis is really important.\n\n483\n00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.020\nA lot of software will\noffer to erase your drive.\n\n484\n00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:57.170\nAnd if it writes all 0s or all 1s across\nthe entire drive, it's erased, right?\n\n485\n00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:58.690\nSort of.\n\n486\n00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:02.730\nWhen you write magnetically to a drive,\nyou're basically writing at a certain\n\n487\n00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:06.090\nfrequency, setting a certain\ncharge on each part of the drive.\n\n488\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:08.490\nAnd it could be stronger or weaker.\n\n489\n00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:13.450\nIt's not a 0 or a 1,\nit's a certain amount of charge\n\n490\n00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:18.560\nthat crosses a threshold to become a 1 or\ndips below a threshold to become a 0.\n\n491\n00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.620\nWell, where it's at up and down can kind\nof show not only what's there now but\n\n492\n00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.350\nwhat was there previously.\n\n493\n00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:28.050\nAnd so people can even recover things\nthat have been overwritten a few times\n\n494\n00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:28.920\nin some scenarios.\n\n495\n00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.338\nThe CIA and\nthe NSA have this down to a science.\n\n496\n00:23:31.338 --> 00:23:35.150\nThey can really get data that's been\noverwritten numerous times, very old data.\n\n497\n00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:39.020\nSo to really help protect,\nthere's different levels.\n\n498\n00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:42.485\nAnd if you look at the default\none that I've got here,\n\n499\n00:23:42.485 --> 00:23:46.191\nwhat it's doing is a Department\nof Defense short erase.\n\n500\n00:23:46.191 --> 00:23:49.830\nAnd it's going to be running through and\ndoing one round.\n\n501\n00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.861\nOne round of writing\nrandom data to the disk.\n\n502\n00:23:52.861 --> 00:23:57.669\nAnd it's using a random number generator,\nthe Mersenne Twister,\n\n503\n00:23:57.669 --> 00:24:02.407\nmt19937ar-cok, to be able to\ngo in there and do the arrays.\n\n504\n00:24:02.407 --> 00:24:04.487\nNow that might not be strong enough for\nme.\n\n505\n00:24:04.487 --> 00:24:06.663\nThis is a short erase.\n\n506\n00:24:06.663 --> 00:24:09.500\nThat might just be suitable if I'm gonna\nreuse the equipment in my own company.\n\n507\n00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.420\nBut if I'm about to sell it on eBay, I\ndon't know who's gonna have it after this.\n\n508\n00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.480\nSo I need to make sure that\nit's absolutely secure.\n\n509\n00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:22.010\nSo I can come in and change to a different\nrandom number generator if I want.\n\n510\n00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.890\nIf I want to switch to ISAAC,\nI can, right.\n\n511\n00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:26.550\nThose are the two that are supported.\n\n512\n00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:29.190\nWhatever software you use might have\neven more that you can choose from.\n\n513\n00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.980\nI'll stick with Mersenne.\n\n514\n00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.850\nAnd then I can change\nthe method that I wanna use.\n\n515\n00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:39.100\nI had DoD short, I could do DoD 5220.22,\n\n516\n00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.900\nthe Gutmann Wipe, PRNG Stream,\nRCMP, Quick Erase.\n\n517\n00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.340\nThere's several different\nmodels that I can choose from.\n\n518\n00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.260\nAnd again, your software may have\neven more options than these,\n\n519\n00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.190\ndepending on what you choose, all right.\n\n520\n00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:53.110\nI'm gonna switch to the DoD 5220.\n\n521\n00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:56.900\nAnd then you can customize your rounds.\n\n522\n00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.580\nAnd the rounds are how many times\nit's gonna overwrite the data.\n\n523\n00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.190\nIf you just do once.\n\n524\n00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:03.640\nit's hard but\n\n525\n00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.850\npeople could still recover data if\nthey had the proper forensic software.\n\n526\n00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.440\nThey'd have to really know\nwhat they were doing.\n\n527\n00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.630\nAnd those are the dangerous people, right?\n\n528\n00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.540\nSo you really want it to go five or\neven seven times.\n\n529\n00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.640\nSo I might choose to run seven rounds,\nokay?\n\n530\n00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.680\nNow even one round could take\nseveral hours to complete.\n\n531\n00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.670\nAt seven rounds this could\ntake days to complete.\n\n532\n00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:27.040\nBut by the time it's done,\n\n533\n00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.340\nI can guarantee that you will not be able\nto recover the data from that drive.\n\n534\n00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:31.840\nAll right?\n\n535\n00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.290\nAs long as I have the time to do that.\n\n536\n00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:37.959\nSo for two or three days, this thing's\ngonna churn through erasing that disc.\n\n537\n00:25:39.592 --> 00:25:41.516\nWhat if I don't have that kind of time?\n\n538\n00:25:41.516 --> 00:25:46.520\nWhat if my security is more important\nthan making a little money on eBay?\n\n539\n00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.090\nRight?\n\n540\n00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.360\nI had this server, and\nit had patient medical records on it.\n\n541\n00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.270\nAnd I have now replaced\nit with a new server and\n\n542\n00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.240\nI don't wanna keep this one anymore.\n\n543\n00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.250\nWell, forget the software.\n\n544\n00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.410\nForget wasting your time\non stuff like this.\n\n545\n00:25:58.410 --> 00:25:59.810\nIt takes a long time.\n\n546\n00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:03.670\nInstead, just destroy the drive,\ndestroy the drive.\n\n547\n00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:08.600\nIf you go on eBay you will find tons\nof servers on sale with no hard drives.\n\n548\n00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.890\nAnd the reason is whoever had them,\njust said forget it.\n\n549\n00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.030\nI'm going to physically\ndestroy the hard drives.\n\n550\n00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:15.260\nThe rest of the server is perfectly fine.\n\n551\n00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.950\nWe'll sell it on eBay, great.\n\n552\n00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:18.830\nBut we destroyed the drives.\n\n553\n00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.760\nWhat's the line from the movie Aliens?\n\n554\n00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.533\nThey take off from space,\nnuke the site from orbit.\n\n555\n00:26:23.533 --> 00:26:24.970\nIt's the only the way to be sure.\n\n556\n00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:25.580\nThat how this is.\n\n557\n00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.270\nIf you destroy the drive,\nit's the only way to be sure.\n\n558\n00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.110\nWe don't have plasma rifles,\nbut it's good enough.\n\n559\n00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.760\nRight?\nYou just destroy the drives.\n\n560\n00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.610\nIt's the only way to be sure.\n\n561\n00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:34.880\nIt's a great tactic, right?\n\n562\n00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.710\nAs far as destroying the drive,\nthere's several different ways to do it.\n\n563\n00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:39.880\nI've seen people where\nthey take a drill and\n\n564\n00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.330\nthey just drill a couple of holes in them.\n\n565\n00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:43.380\nThat works but\n\n566\n00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.710\nit's not 100% effective because you're not\ngetting every cluster when you do that.\n\n567\n00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:50.120\nSome files can be recovered\neven with holes drilled in it.\n\n568\n00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.440\nSo while it's hard,\nyou can still get data off of there.\n\n569\n00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:58.130\n&gt;&gt; Don, I know that in this day and\nage we have just an exponential\n\n570\n00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:02.250\nincrease of the BYOD, bring your own\ndevice, mobile devices out there.\n\n571\n00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.420\nI've got one, you know Don's got one.\n\n572\n00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.680\nWe've got tablets out there and\n\n573\n00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.160\nthey've all got storage as well that could\npotentially have sensitive information.\n\n574\n00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:13.800\nIf I've got a tablet that maybe is\nconnected to like a database for\n\n575\n00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.340\nHIPAA records and stuff.\n\n576\n00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:21.180\nHow is it that, if maybe one of these\ndevices grows legs and is stolen.\n\n577\n00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.730\nOr I'm gonna sell it,\nI'm gonna re-purpose it.\n\n578\n00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:27.400\nIs there a way that we can eradicate\nthe data that's on these devices?\n\n579\n00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a great point, right?\n\n580\n00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.890\nBecause if we physically have the drive,\nyeah, we can drill holes in it, right?\n\n581\n00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:33.090\nWe can run it through a shredder.\n\n582\n00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.680\nThey have the commercial shredders that,\nlike you shred paper.\n\n583\n00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.220\nThey have ones that shred\nentire hard drives.\n\n584\n00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.780\nAnd these things are awesome.\n\n585\n00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.910\nIf you ever got bored go on YouTube and\ndo a search for hard drive shredder.\n\n586\n00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.810\nTheir awesome videos on it,\nif you physically have it.\n\n587\n00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:48.790\nBut if you're talking about a phone\nI can't talk about a D band CD and\n\n588\n00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.390\nerase a phone, right?\n\n589\n00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:53.690\nAnd if the phone is five states\naway I definitely can't do that.\n\n590\n00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:58.420\nSo a lot of mobile device vendors\nare starting to build in remote wipe.\n\n591\n00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:02.095\nAnd the remote wipe is where the phone\nwill have a secure section of data.\n\n592\n00:28:02.095 --> 00:28:04.560\nIt is normally encrypted,\nand they erase it.\n\n593\n00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.350\nMore importantly, they ditch the\nencryption keys, so it can't be decrypted.\n\n594\n00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.200\nAnd it doesn't erase the whole phone.\n\n595\n00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.350\nCuz this might be\nsomebody's personal phone.\n\n596\n00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:15.486\nIn the bring your own device age where\npeople will have their phones and\n\n597\n00:28:15.486 --> 00:28:16.295\nstuff from home.\n\n598\n00:28:16.295 --> 00:28:18.860\nYou can't go and destroy their home phone.\n\n599\n00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.860\nBut you can erase your\ncorporate data that's on it.\n\n600\n00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.250\nSo be aware that there's just a number\nof different options out there for\n\n601\n00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:24.680\ncontrolling that data.\n\n602\n00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:28.790\nOn our server's it's normally gonna\ncome down to whole disk encryption and\n\n603\n00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.760\nphysical destruction of the drives\nwhen we're ready to get rid of them.\n\n604\n00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.490\nSo just be aware of those options and\n\n605\n00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:36.270\nthere are other options\nthat are out there.\n\n606\n00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:37.350\nYou know, Don, one more question.\n\n607\n00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:40.980\nI know you've been mentioning this\nthroughout this episode here about\n\n608\n00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.740\nstorage in the Cloud.\n\n609\n00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.250\nNow, this will probably\ntwo questions in one here.\n\n610\n00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:47.840\nWe'll really throw some questions out-\n&gt;&gt; Is this a beauty pageant?\n\n611\n00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.750\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\nSo does the technology exist, and\n\n612\n00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:54.260\nif it does do you use it inside\nof the Cloud for making sure that\n\n613\n00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:58.530\nif you are bringing one of these servers\noffline that you truly eradicate the data.\n\n614\n00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:00.850\nOr is that something that's\ngoing to be part of the SLA for\n\n615\n00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:02.120\nthe Cloud service provider?\n\n616\n00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nSo it is part of the SLA.\n\n617\n00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:05.110\nLike if you go to Amazon web services,\n\n618\n00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:09.740\nthey tell you in there that they do a\nseven pass wipe process on any storage you\n\n619\n00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.980\nuse before they turn it over\nto another customer, right.\n\n620\n00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.890\nSo it's in the SLA, they do it.\n\n621\n00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:17.960\nAnd I've got no reason not to trust them,\nbut I also have no reason to trust them.\n\n622\n00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.240\nRight.\nI don't know they do it,\n\n623\n00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.160\nthey tell me and I have no way to verify.\n\n624\n00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.520\nHow do you verify that?\n\n625\n00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.640\nI can't say, I need you to\nshow me those drives again so\n\n626\n00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.130\nI can make sure you wiped them.\n\n627\n00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:28.090\nThere's no way,\nit's gone into a giant pool.\n\n628\n00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:32.960\nSo it is in the SLA but\nyou need to do your own.\n\n629\n00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:38.320\nAnd you can do whole disk encryption\non Cloud deployed servers, absolutely.\n\n630\n00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.330\nSo even though they're gonna wipe it.\n\n631\n00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.100\nYou should still do your own encryption.\n\n632\n00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.970\nAnd if you're deploying a Cloud server and\n\n633\n00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.340\nit's got a little check mark\nthat says encrypt the drives.\n\n634\n00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:50.350\nMake sure it's using your key and\nyou have to provide it.\n\n635\n00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:51.800\nA lot of times they generate a key for\nyou.\n\n636\n00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:52.590\nWell, you know what that means?\n\n637\n00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:53.600\nIt means they've got your key!\n\n638\n00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.020\nAnd if they have your key,\nthen you might as well not have it.\n\n639\n00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.130\nBecause they're the people you're\ntrying to protect against.\n\n640\n00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:02.700\nSo make sure you use your own key, your\nown technology, and encrypt those drives.\n\n641\n00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.380\nIt may mean that you have to build\nthe VMs in your own data center, and\n\n642\n00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.580\nthen move them up into the Cloud\nwhich all of them support.\n\n643\n00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.850\nThey don't necessarily call that out\nbecause it's much easier to hit launch\n\n644\n00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.150\nserver than it is import VM template.\n\n645\n00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:16.840\nBut you can create an encrypted\nVM template and bring it in and\n\n646\n00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.080\nhave it fire right up and\naccess your systems.\n\n647\n00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.205\nAnd now you know that data is safe.\n\n648\n00:30:20.205 --> 00:30:21.001\nAll right.\n\n649\n00:30:21.001 --> 00:30:23.700\nWell man,\nthere is a lot of great information here.\n\n650\n00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:27.290\nAnd I tell you what, you definitely gotta\nconsider it when it comes to security.\n\n651\n00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:29.450\nDon, it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n652\n00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:32.590\nBut before we do, do you have any\ndeparting words that you might want to let\n\n653\n00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:35.770\nour viewers know when it comes\nto secure storage disposal?\n\n654\n00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:39.340\n&gt;&gt; It might sound paranoid but\nyou can't be too safe.\n\n655\n00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:42.290\nOne last thing is if you do choose\nto do full disk encryption,\n\n656\n00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:44.810\nyou might have the choice\nof picking algorithms.\n\n657\n00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:50.200\nMost processors, Intel and AMD processors,\nhave acceleration built into them for AES.\n\n658\n00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.710\nSo if you can do AES-256, it's one of\nthe best protocols you could pick.\n\n659\n00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:56.860\nIf you start picking some of the weirder\nalgorithms, you probably don't have\n\n660\n00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.150\nhardware acceleration for that and\nit's gonna start hurting performance.\n\n661\n00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.870\nIf you have an array controller, check\nthe array controller's documentation.\n\n662\n00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:04.750\nIt may have the ability to\ndo hardware encryption and\n\n663\n00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.372\nnow it's even less load on your systems.\n\n664\n00:31:06.372 --> 00:31:09.260\nAll stuff to check on in\nthe documentation for your equipment.\n\n665\n00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.690\n&gt;&gt; All right, great episode there.\n\n666\n00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:14.460\nLooks like we're gonna have some tin\nfoil origami after this episode ends.\n\n667\n00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:17.885\nSigning out for IT Pro TV,\nI've been

to dive right back into\nthe world of access controls.\n\n14\n00:00:30.026 --> 00:00:33.838\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be taking\na look at logical access controls.\n\n15\n00:00:33.838 --> 00:00:35.510\nNow we have kind of two\ndifferent divisions so\n\n16\n00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.108\nlet's kind of lay that out right here\nat the beginning of the episode.\n\n17\n00:00:38.108 --> 00:00:43.966\nFirst off an access control is simply us,\nwell, controlling access, right?\n\n18\n00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:48.777\nRestricting or\nallowing people to access resources.\n\n19\n00:00:48.777 --> 00:00:50.616\nAnd those resources could be anything.\n\n20\n00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:54.870\nIt could be a file, it could be a folder,\nit could be a printer.\n\n21\n00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.197\nIt could be a room, it could be a building\nor a vehicle, it could be anything.\n\n22\n00:00:59.197 --> 00:01:02.825\nAnd if we wanna restrict who's\nallowed to use that resource,\n\n23\n00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:04.445\nwe need an access control.\n\n24\n00:01:04.445 --> 00:01:08.589\nIn the world of physical access control,\nyou have things like door locks, right?\n\n25\n00:01:08.589 --> 00:01:11.645\nYou can't get into the room so you\ncan't use the computer that's in there.\n\n26\n00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:13.772\nBut once somebody's on a computer,\n\n27\n00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:17.487\nwe can further restrict them by\nusing logical access controls.\n\n28\n00:01:17.487 --> 00:01:20.831\nAnd logical access controls\nare much more detailed,\n\n29\n00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:24.926\nmuch more fine-grained than\nphysical access control, right?\n\n30\n00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:28.706\nFor example, if physical access\ncontrols have a challenge,\n\n31\n00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:31.105\nif I have 20 computers in this room and\n\n32\n00:01:31.105 --> 00:01:35.772\nI want to allow Wes to get to one of\nthose computers, I can't use a door lock.\n\n33\n00:01:35.772 --> 00:01:38.716\nBecause once he unlocks the door,\nhe can get to all 20 computers.\n\n34\n00:01:38.716 --> 00:01:40.170\nI just want to limited him to one.\n\n35\n00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.325\nSo now I've gotta come up with some\nkind of physical locking mechanism on\n\n36\n00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:46.028\nthe individual computers, so\nhe'd only have access to one.\n\n37\n00:01:46.028 --> 00:01:48.379\nThat gets to be pretty difficult, right?\n\n38\n00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:51.589\nBut in the world of logical access\ncontrol, I can do that pretty easy.\n\n39\n00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:54.233\nWes might be able to get\nto the physical computer.\n\n40\n00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:58.945\nBut I can set a rule that says his user\naccount only works on computer number\n\n41\n00:01:58.945 --> 00:02:03.818\nseven, and it doesn't work on one\nthrough 20 or the rest of them, right?\n\n42\n00:02:03.818 --> 00:02:06.468\nI can do that logically very easily.\n\n43\n00:02:06.468 --> 00:02:09.802\nNow we have to be careful because\nwhile logical access control works,\n\n44\n00:02:09.802 --> 00:02:12.182\nthere's still ways\nphysically to get around it.\n\n45\n00:02:12.182 --> 00:02:16.324\nSo Wes could walk in there and say well,\nI have access to computer seven, but\n\n46\n00:02:16.324 --> 00:02:18.869\nI really wanna see what's\non computer eight.\n\n47\n00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:22.559\nSo since I'm in here, let me just crack\nopen the case to computer eight and\n\n48\n00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.191\nrip the hard drive out and\nlet me take it home with me.\n\n49\n00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:28.491\nOr even right there, he could take\nthe hard drive out of the computer and\n\n50\n00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:31.027\nhe stick it onto computer\nseven as a second hard drive.\n\n51\n00:02:31.027 --> 00:02:32.863\nHe's allowed to use computer seven.\n\n52\n00:02:32.863 --> 00:02:34.750\nAnd now he can browse\ninto that hard drive and\n\n53\n00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.658\naccess the data on a computer he\nwouldn't normally have access to.\n\n54\n00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:43.763\nSo physical access usually gives you\nthe ability to overcome any logical access\n\n55\n00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:49.518\ncontrols that we might have in place,\nso we've got to remember to do both.\n\n56\n00:02:49.518 --> 00:02:52.697\nYou need to have logical and\nphysical access controls in places.\n\n57\n00:02:52.697 --> 00:02:55.907\nSo we're doing episodes on both,\none on physical, one on logical.\n\n58\n00:02:55.907 --> 00:02:58.554\nIn this episode we're gonna take\na look at the logical side of things.\n\n59\n00:02:58.554 --> 00:03:01.979\nSo we're gonna assume, and\nyou know what happens when you assume, but\n\n60\n00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:05.292\nwe're gonna assume that whoever it\nis that we're trying to restrict\n\n61\n00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:06.852\nalready has access to a system.\n\n62\n00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:11.343\nAnd from there, we need to basically\nrestrict what they're allowed to do,\n\n63\n00:03:11.343 --> 00:03:14.864\nwhether they're capable of\nperforming once they're in.\n\n64\n00:03:14.864 --> 00:03:19.326\nNow, one of the easiest ways to do\nthat is to require a user account.\n\n65\n00:03:19.326 --> 00:03:21.597\nAnd most operator systems do this.\n\n66\n00:03:21.597 --> 00:03:25.349\nUnix, Linux, Windows, Mac OS,\nthey all have user accounts.\n\n67\n00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.190\nAnd user accounts are a great way to\nrestrict things because you have to\n\n68\n00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.692\nauthenticate to use a user account.\n\n69\n00:03:29.692 --> 00:03:31.448\nYou've got to have a username and\na password.\n\n70\n00:03:31.448 --> 00:03:34.437\nAnd once you've presented\nthat username and a password,\n\n71\n00:03:34.437 --> 00:03:36.821\nnow you gain access to resources,\nall right?\n\n72\n00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:40.560\nSo let's just take an example, and\nwe'll use Microsoft Windows here.\n\n73\n00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.013\nIf I have a Windows system setup, so\nI'm running Windows Server 2012 R2.\n\n74\n00:03:45.013 --> 00:03:49.304\nAnd I wanna give Wes access to\nsomething on this computer, right?\n\n75\n00:03:49.304 --> 00:03:52.214\nSo maybe I've got a folder in here,\n\n76\n00:03:52.214 --> 00:03:57.461\nI'll just whip up a folder real\nquick called Shared Documents.\n\n77\n00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:00.572\nSo I'm creating this\nShared Documents folder, and\n\n78\n00:04:00.572 --> 00:04:03.550\nin there maybe I've got\na folder called Reports.\n\n79\n00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.879\nAnd, maybe an employee manual,\nor an Employee Handbook.\n\n80\n00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.234\nAnd I sort of know how to spell employee,\nthere we go.\n\n81\n00:04:13.234 --> 00:04:17.026\nAnd so I start creating\na couple of things in here, and\n\n82\n00:04:17.026 --> 00:04:19.062\nmaybe Wes is an IT guy for us.\n\n83\n00:04:19.062 --> 00:04:23.462\nAnd so we come in here and we create\nanother folder for Network Documentation,\n\n84\n00:04:23.462 --> 00:04:26.339\ncuz we always have to have documentation,\nright?\n\n85\n00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:31.319\nNow, when I start creating these folders,\nI might want Wes to be able to\n\n86\n00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:35.229\nwrite documents in\nthe Network Documentation folder.\n\n87\n00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:39.005\nBecause he works in the IT department,\nI want him to create documentation.\n\n88\n00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:45.464\nBut he's an IT guy, I don't want\nhim editing the employee handbook.\n\n89\n00:04:45.464 --> 00:04:48.083\nAs an employee I want him to be able\nto read the employee handbook, but\n\n90\n00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:49.678\nI don't want him to edit it and change it.\n\n91\n00:04:49.678 --> 00:04:51.530\nI'm gonna have Human Resources people.\n\n92\n00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.762\nI want them to be able to\nedit the employee handbook.\n\n93\n00:04:53.762 --> 00:04:57.849\nBut I don't want Wes to say it says\nhere employees get two weeks of vacation\n\n94\n00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:58.528\nevery year.\n\n95\n00:04:58.528 --> 00:05:01.442\nLet's just change that to a three,\nnow we get three weeks of vacation.\n\n96\n00:05:01.442 --> 00:05:03.119\nSo I have different things\nthat I want to allow.\n\n97\n00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:05.392\nI might want Wes to be able to read that,\nbut\n\n98\n00:05:05.392 --> 00:05:07.864\nthe HR department to be able to read and\nwrite.\n\n99\n00:05:07.864 --> 00:05:10.925\nI can't do that, if everybody\nlogs in with the same account.\n\n100\n00:05:10.925 --> 00:05:13.081\nIf everybody logs in with\nthe same user account,\n\n101\n00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:15.828\nI have no way of discriminating\nbetween one user and another.\n\n102\n00:05:15.828 --> 00:05:18.101\nSo I need to create separate accounts.\n\n103\n00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:21.063\nAnd again, most systems have that support.\n\n104\n00:05:21.063 --> 00:05:25.299\nHere inside of Windows Server,\nI can go into my local users and\n\n105\n00:05:25.299 --> 00:05:28.568\ngroups and\nI can start to create user accounts.\n\n106\n00:05:28.568 --> 00:05:32.520\nAnd so I can create a user for Wes Bryan.\n\n107\n00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.668\nAnd, or actually that would be\nthe username there and the full name.\n\n108\n00:05:36.668 --> 00:05:40.648\nIf I was on a Linux or Unix machine,\nI would use the User Add command and\n\n109\n00:05:40.648 --> 00:05:44.029\nthen you go through and\nbasically set these same options.\n\n110\n00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:48.822\nBut I'm gonna give him a password,\nwhatever that's gonna be,\n\n111\n00:05:48.822 --> 00:05:53.100\nand then it says User must\nchange password at next log on.\n\n112\n00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.830\nNow, if I uncheck that I know what\nhis password is, because I set it.\n\n113\n00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.679\nSo am I able to prove beyond a doubt\nthat somebody logging in with his\n\n114\n00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:02.652\naccount is him?\n\n115\n00:06:02.652 --> 00:06:05.126\nNo, because he knows the password and\nI know the password.\n\n116\n00:06:05.126 --> 00:06:08.949\nSo if somebody logs in as Wes and does\nsome damage, it could have been Wes or\n\n117\n00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:10.131\nit could have been me.\n\n118\n00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:14.667\nSo when I check this off and say user\nmust change the password at next log in,\n\n119\n00:06:14.667 --> 00:06:18.627\nwhen Wes logs on, it's gonna prompt\nhim to change the password so\n\n120\n00:06:18.627 --> 00:06:20.643\nthat only he knows the password.\n\n121\n00:06:20.643 --> 00:06:24.830\nSo now if somebody logs in as Wes and\ndoes some damage, I know it was him.\n\n122\n00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.276\nOr I know he gave his password out,\nwhich people do it.\n\n123\n00:06:28.276 --> 00:06:29.913\nWes wouldn't do that,\nI'm wronging Wes here.\n\n124\n00:06:29.913 --> 00:06:32.429\nWes wouldn't do that but\nother people would, right?\n\n125\n00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:35.665\nEverybody's seen that, that employee who\nhas their password on a Post-it note stuck\n\n126\n00:06:35.665 --> 00:06:36.828\nto their monitor or whatever.\n\n127\n00:06:36.828 --> 00:06:38.915\nAnd that's where this kind of\nidentity goes out the window.\n\n128\n00:06:38.915 --> 00:06:41.907\nAnd in another episode we'll talk about\nmulti-factor authentication that helps to\n\n129\n00:06:41.907 --> 00:06:42.453\nprevent that.\n\n130\n00:06:42.453 --> 00:06:45.107\nBut from this side it's\njust a password so,\n\n131\n00:06:45.107 --> 00:06:47.851\nit's not the most secure method available.\n\n132\n00:06:47.851 --> 00:06:48.669\nAll right.\n\n133\n00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:50.707\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate that account for him.\n\n134\n00:06:50.707 --> 00:06:53.957\nAnd maybe I've got Jane Smith, and\n\n135\n00:06:53.957 --> 00:06:59.058\nJane is the Vice President\nof Human Resources, right?\n\n136\n00:06:59.058 --> 00:07:05.261\nSo, I might put in here,\nVP of Human Resources.\n\n137\n00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:09.473\nAnd so, she's a bigwig in the company,\nshe's important.\n\n138\n00:07:09.473 --> 00:07:11.509\nAnd so she's over at Human Resources,\n\n139\n00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:15.035\nso I want her to be able to modify\nthings like the employee handbook.\n\n140\n00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:18.273\nAnd so I'm gonna create her\naccount just like I did Wes's.\n\n141\n00:07:18.273 --> 00:07:22.191\nAnd normally I'd leave that\npassword bit checked there but\n\n142\n00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:23.923\nI'm gonna just let it go.\n\n143\n00:07:23.923 --> 00:07:27.567\nAnd apparently I didn't type\nthe same password twice, so\n\n144\n00:07:27.567 --> 00:07:30.613\nlet me try that again, and\nwe'll get that created.\n\n145\n00:07:30.613 --> 00:07:31.487\nAll right.\n\n146\n00:07:31.487 --> 00:07:34.466\nSo now that I've Jane and Wes created,\n\n147\n00:07:34.466 --> 00:07:38.268\nI can give them access based\non what their role is.\n\n148\n00:07:38.268 --> 00:07:42.135\nAnd this is kind of the heart and\nsoul of logical access control,\n\n149\n00:07:42.135 --> 00:07:45.356\nis that I can go to a folder,\nlike the Reports folder or\n\n150\n00:07:45.356 --> 00:07:49.317\nthe Network Documentation folder,\nEmployee Handbook folder.\n\n151\n00:07:49.317 --> 00:07:54.277\nThat's my resource, and then I can\ndictate who has access to it by using\n\n152\n00:07:54.277 --> 00:07:58.740\nan access control list,\nan ACL An access control is just a list,\n\n153\n00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:03.380\nthat's the name,\nof who's allowed to use that resource.\n\n154\n00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.500\nAnd not only who's allowed to use it but\nwhat are they allowed to do?\n\n155\n00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.370\nWhat are authorized to perform with it?\n\n156\n00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.510\nAre they only allowed to read?\n\n157\n00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.210\nOr are they allowed to write also, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.500\nSo the employee handbook folder that one,\n\n159\n00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.290\nI might want where Jane can read and\nwrite, but Wes can only read.\n\n160\n00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.950\nSo I can pull up\nthe properties of that folder.\n\n161\n00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:29.228\nI can go to the Security tab and\nI can see who has access right now, okay?\n\n162\n00:08:29.228 --> 00:08:34.700\nNow I'm gonna edit that list and\nyou'll see things like creator owner.\n\n163\n00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.780\nCreator owner is me I made it,\n\n164\n00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.800\nand system, that's the operating\nsystem that it's running on.\n\n165\n00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.460\nAdministrators, well I was\nan administrator when I made it so\n\n166\n00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.750\nI got access, but\nthen Users, everybody else.\n\n167\n00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.550\nI can see Windows have given an default\nset of permissions on this folder.\n\n168\n00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:55.080\nAnd I know their default, cuz see how\nthese little checkmarks are grayed out?\n\n169\n00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.737\nIf I check something,\nit's a bold black check mark.\n\n170\n00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.700\nBut these are grayed out, and\nif check something I can uncheck it but\n\n171\n00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.310\nI can't uncheck these.\n\n172\n00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.720\nThese are defaults that\nare being inherited.\n\n173\n00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.310\nWith file systems, if you don't\nset permissions on a folder, or\n\n174\n00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.650\non a file, they inherit\nthe permissions of the parent item.\n\n175\n00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.970\nI made this folder and\nI made it on my C drive.\n\n176\n00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:23.150\nWell, my C drive has permission,\ndefault once that Microsoft set and so\n\n177\n00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:27.110\nthose are trickled down and\nbeen inherited by this folder.\n\n178\n00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.180\nAnd then they maybe what I want and\nthen may not.\n\n179\n00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.950\nIn this case, they're not what I want.\n\n180\n00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:36.550\nI don't want just any old user\nto have access to this folder.\n\n181\n00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.670\nI wanna restrict it to certain employees.\n\n182\n00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.085\nI might have contractors, and\nI don't want the contractors to get our\n\n183\n00:09:42.085 --> 00:09:44.510\nemployee handbook,\nthey're not our employees, right?\n\n184\n00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.860\nSo I may want to change\nthis from what we've got.\n\n185\n00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.900\nAnd if you wanna do that,\nin Linux and Unix it's real easy,\n\n186\n00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.330\nyou just override it right\nthere at the folder.\n\n187\n00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.480\nBut in Windows we actually have to\nactually disable that inheritance.\n\n188\n00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.661\nWe have to tell it not to inherit those\npermissions from up above, all right?\n\n189\n00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:05.850\nSo if I were to go in here and start\nto modify these, well I can add to it.\n\n190\n00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.530\nBut the permissions that are here\nalready aren't gonna go away,\n\n191\n00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.110\nthose ones that are grayed out.\n\n192\n00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:15.720\nAnd if I cancel that and I go down here\nto advanced, inside of the advance\n\n193\n00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.400\nscreen I can look at permissions and right\nhere I've got that disable inheritance.\n\n194\n00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.010\nAnd when I disable\nthe inheritance on this folder,\n\n195\n00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.630\nsay what says convert the inherited\npermissions into explicit permissions.\n\n196\n00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.870\nIn other words it's gonna copy\nthose permissions down so\n\n197\n00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.980\nthat they're just right here,\nso there's something.\n\n198\n00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.250\nOr I can say remove everything and\ngive me a blank slate.\n\n199\n00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.090\nWell, I want a blank slate so\nthat's what I'm gonna do but you can go\n\n200\n00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.960\neither route depending on whether you\nwant to have a starting point or not.\n\n201\n00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.840\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, this might be an obvious\nanswer to a question here, but\n\n202\n00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.900\nam I right to assume that if it says\nconvert these into explicit permissions,\n\n203\n00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.210\nthan the inherited permissions\nmust be an implicit permission\n\n204\n00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.890\nbecause of the fact that you\ndidn't manually set them yourself.\n\n205\n00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I probably should have used\nthat word cuz it's one of the official\n\n206\n00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.280\nsecurity words is implicit permissions.\n\n207\n00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.990\nWhen we inherit permissions,\n\n208\n00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:07.300\nit's implied that we're following the\npermissions from up above versus explicit,\n\n209\n00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.470\nwhere I've explicitly stated\nthese are the permissions, right?\n\n210\n00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.900\nThat's the difference between implicit and\nexplicit.\n\n211\n00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.530\nSo in this scenario, I'm converting\nfrom the implicit to explicit.\n\n212\n00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.160\nOr I'm removing all of them altogether,\nI'm gonna remove it.\n\n213\n00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.960\nSo I'm gonna remove everything,\nand now there's no permissions.\n\n214\n00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.630\nNow you've gotta be careful here,\n\n215\n00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.530\nbecause what happens if you have\nno permissions on the folder?\n\n216\n00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.400\nNobody has access, even me.\n\n217\n00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.070\nSo most operating systems\nleverage what's called an owner.\n\n218\n00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:36.110\nWhen you create a folder,\nyou create a file, there's an owner.\n\n219\n00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.030\nAnd even if no permissions are assigned,\n\n220\n00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:42.110\nthe owner is still able\nto access the resource.\n\n221\n00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.410\nAnd so if you look up here at the top,\n\n222\n00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.410\nyou'll see Owner is\nthe Administrators group.\n\n223\n00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:47.810\nBecause I made it, right?\n\n224\n00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.630\nAnd I was an administrator, so\nthe administrators been given that access.\n\n225\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:55.360\nIn Unix and Linux and even Mac OS the\nowner is usually root, the root account.\n\n226\n00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.000\nSo I can always switch over to\nthe context of the root account and\n\n227\n00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.520\nstill access that folder and\nfix the permissions.\n\n228\n00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.140\nBut it is possible to lock yourself out,\nnot permanently though.\n\n229\n00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.890\nYou can't permanently lock yourself\nout of access to a file or\n\n230\n00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.860\nfolder you can always gain\naccess back in again.\n\n231\n00:12:10.258 --> 00:12:13.680\nAll right, so\nI wanna add permissions back in here and\n\n232\n00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.720\nthe permissions that I wanna add are gonna\nbe based on what I want this folder to be.\n\n233\n00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.070\nNow I probably do want\nadministrators to have access.\n\n234\n00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:25.470\nAnd so when I come in here and add those\npermissions, let me switch back to the,\n\n235\n00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.110\nI'm still in the advanced view,\nwhich makes it overly difficult.\n\n236\n00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.940\nSo let me go back to the normal view.\n\n237\n00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.910\nIt's gonna complain that I\ndidn't give anybody permission,\n\n238\n00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.110\nbut that's okay, I'm just trying\nto switch back to the easier view.\n\n239\n00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.280\nSo I'm gonna add in a few people here,\nall right?\n\n240\n00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.160\nI'm going to add administrators back in.\n\n241\n00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.810\nAs an administrator, I need access\nbecause I need to verify files and\n\n242\n00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:51.120\nhelp people when they problems, so\nI'm gonna put that one back in, all right?\n\n243\n00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.000\nBut I'm also going to add in\nthe system account, all right?\n\n244\n00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.180\nWe saw system a minute ago and\nI removed it and\n\n245\n00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.180\nI said the system actually\nrefers to the computer itself.\n\n246\n00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:03.010\nNow why would I add\nthe system account back in?\n\n247\n00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:08.700\nYou don't have to but if you're running\nautomated backups on this computer,\n\n248\n00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.770\nthe back up software needs to be able\nto access this folder to back it up.\n\n249\n00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.750\nIf the back up software doesn't have\npermission to access the folder,\n\n250\n00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:15.880\nit's not gonna be able to do it.\n\n251\n00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.710\nWhile most back up software\nruns as the system account.\n\n252\n00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.270\nAll right, some backup software\nruns with a network account,\n\n253\n00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.340\nyou shouldn't use the network account\nbecause all sorts of stuff uses it.\n\n254\n00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.080\nSo if you have software like that,\n\n255\n00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.270\nit's better to create what's\ncalled a service account.\n\n256\n00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.560\nA user account that's specifically for\nthat service.\n\n257\n00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.150\nAnd you could add that in here.\n\n258\n00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.670\nI'm gonna talk about groups in a minute,\nand\n\n259\n00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:39.000\nwe can leverage groups to achieve\nthat same goal and fix it.\n\n260\n00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.990\nBut for right now I'm gonna\nuse the system account.\n\n261\n00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.360\nSome of you might be thinking\nthat's inefficient, and\n\n262\n00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.150\nI'll explain the right\nway here in a minute.\n\n263\n00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.780\nAll right, so I'm gonna punch that one in.\n\n264\n00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.340\nThen I'm gonna add Jane Smith\n\n265\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.270\nbecause she's the Vice President\nof Human Resources, and\n\n266\n00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:57.240\nI thought her name was Jane Smith but\nmaybe we'll type it in as jsmith.\n\n267\n00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.090\nThere we go.\n\n268\n00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:01.640\nSo I'm gonna add Jane and\nI'm gonna add Wes.\n\n269\n00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.240\nNow each of them are going to\nhave different permissions.\n\n270\n00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.600\nI want Wes to be able to read.\n\n271\n00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.410\nAnd if you look at the permissions\nthat are down here what do we see?\n\n272\n00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.680\nFull control, modify, read and\n\n273\n00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.570\nexecute, list folder contents,\nread, write, special permission.\n\n274\n00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:19.100\nAll right, so what do we choose?\n\n275\n00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.990\nFull control, you can do whatever the heck\nyou want with the files in this folder.\n\n276\n00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:27.720\nYou can delete files, create files,\nedit them, change them, rename them.\n\n277\n00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.800\nYou can change permissions on\nthe files if you want to, right?\n\n278\n00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.420\nSo you could actually move people's\naccess or add people's access.\n\n279\n00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.980\nYou can do whatever you want.\n\n280\n00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:41.220\nModify, modify says I can open the file,\n\n281\n00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.890\nI can change the file and\nI can save it again.\n\n282\n00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.460\nI can create new files and\nI can delete files.\n\n283\n00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.410\nBut I can't change permissions.\n\n284\n00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:49.660\nI can't give people access.\n\n285\n00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.340\nI can't take away access.\n\n286\n00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.850\nBut I can change the files.\n\n287\n00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.856\nI can change them as well as deleting and\nI agree.\n\n288\n00:14:57.856 --> 00:15:02.390\nRead &amp; execute, I can open the file and\n\n289\n00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:05.420\nlook at it and if it's a program,\nI can open the file to run it.\n\n290\n00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.000\nWrite or script, same thing.\n\n291\n00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000\nSo this is being able to open the file and\nlook at it, but I can modify it.\n\n292\n00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.220\nAnd that's important if you have protected\ndata, you want people to see it but\n\n293\n00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.550\nnot be able to change it.\n\n294\n00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.670\nModify is sometimes called write, and\n\n295\n00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:21.160\nwe'll see it a lit bit later\nwhere it shows write permissions.\n\n296\n00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.080\nI'm modifying the permissions on a folder.\n\n297\n00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.130\nAnd on a folder it's listed as modify.\n\n298\n00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:29.400\nIf I were modifying the permissions on an\nindividual file it would show it as write.\n\n299\n00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.890\nIt just different terms that technically\nmean the same thing at this level.\n\n300\n00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.940\nAnd when I get down here a little\nbit lower I'll see read and\n\n301\n00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.890\nwrite and that's because we're\nseeing different context\n\n302\n00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:41.460\nhere based on whether it's a folder or\na file.\n\n303\n00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.989\nList folder contents is the same as read.\n\n304\n00:15:44.989 --> 00:15:46.901\nRead means I can open a file and\nlook at it,\n\n305\n00:15:46.901 --> 00:15:50.577\nlist folder contents means I can open\na folder and look at what's in it, right?\n\n306\n00:15:50.577 --> 00:15:54.029\nThey're both effectively read,\njust different names for\n\n307\n00:15:54.029 --> 00:15:58.388\nthe different resource context And\nthen write which I already explained.\n\n308\n00:15:58.388 --> 00:15:59.744\nAnd then we get special permissions.\n\n309\n00:15:59.744 --> 00:16:02.460\nThese are weird ones, weird permissions\nthat you might wanna hand out.\n\n310\n00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.200\nThere's all sorts of crazy permissions\nin different operating systems that\n\n311\n00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.600\ndictate things like whether you can\n\n312\n00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.590\nrun a file under the identity of\nanother user or things like that.\n\n313\n00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.260\nThose are special permissions and\nit can get really crazy.\n\n314\n00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.180\nThey're not on the exam cuz they're\nreally very specific to each OS.\n\n315\n00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.430\nBut there are things that\ngo beyond the normal realm.\n\n316\n00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.200\nNow for Wes I want him to be able to\naccess the employee handbook folder.\n\n317\n00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.788\nAnd I want him to be able to read but not\nchange anything and that's the default.\n\n318\n00:16:29.788 --> 00:16:30.690\nThat's what I've got, read and\n\n319\n00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:34.050\nexecute this folder contents,\nread the files that are inside there.\n\n320\n00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:35.920\nThat's perfect, okay?\n\n321\n00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.380\nIf I take a look at Jane though Jane,\nI want her to be able to modify,\n\n322\n00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.240\nshe is the Vice President of\nHuman Resources, she's allowed,\n\n323\n00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.280\nshe can go in there and modify those so\nI'll give her that access and\n\n324\n00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:51.460\nas I scroll down you'll see she gets read\nand write she gets all those permissions\n\n325\n00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.710\nbecause they are all\nunder the helm of modify.\n\n326\n00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:57.510\nI can't give somebody modify\npermissions and not give them read.\n\n327\n00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.560\nThey have to be able to open and read\nthe file in order to modify it, right?\n\n328\n00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:05.050\nSo when I check some of these, you'll see\nwhere it will automatically check others.\n\n329\n00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:09.810\nSo if I uncheck everything and\nI click Modify, see how it automatically\n\n330\n00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:12.309\nadded the others cuz they're really\nwrapped together at that point.\n\n331\n00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:17.310\nNow, you might be asking yourself, well,\nDon, she's the Vice President of HR.\n\n332\n00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.930\nShouldn't we give her full control, too?\n\n333\n00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:24.990\nWell, you could, but Jane,\nI'm sure she's very good at her job\n\n334\n00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:29.850\nas running Human Resources and that\nshe's got numerous HR certifications and\n\n335\n00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:34.670\ndegrees, but does she know how\nto set NTFS file permissions?\n\n336\n00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:35.450\nProbably not.\n\n337\n00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.430\nIt's probably not something that's\nreally been under her realm or\n\n338\n00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:39.980\nher responsibilities and duties.\n\n339\n00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.990\nThat's the IT department's duties.\n\n340\n00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.820\nAnd by giving her full control,\n\n341\n00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:48.700\nI'm giving her access to things\nthat she doesn't need access to.\n\n342\n00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.890\nShe can do everything\nshe needs with modify.\n\n343\n00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:55.800\nShe has full control of all\nthe document,s as far as she knows,\n\n344\n00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.790\ninside of that folder.\n\n345\n00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.790\nShe doesn't need to mess with permissions.\n\n346\n00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.930\nIf she needs to mess with permissions,\nshe can do a support ticket to the IT\n\n347\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.850\ndepartment and we can go in and\nmodify them for her, right.\n\n348\n00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:09.990\nBut you gotta understand what people's\nrequirements are to do their job.\n\n349\n00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.290\nMicrosoft has this principle,\nbut it really applies everywhere,\n\n350\n00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.530\ncalled the Principle of Least Privileged.\n\n351\n00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:18.150\nWhen you give somebody access,\nwhen you use logical access controls,\n\n352\n00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:24.550\nyou should be giving them the bare minimum\naccess necessary for them to do their job.\n\n353\n00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.730\nAnything that you give them extra,\nopens just at the risk.\n\n354\n00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:31.100\nThey can go and make a mistake.\n\n355\n00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.250\nThey can do some damage And\nnow you gotta go in and fix it.\n\n356\n00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:39.260\nIf I gave her full control, she might\nlook at it and say, what is system?\n\n357\n00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.320\nI don't know what system is,\nlet me remove that or\n\n358\n00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.330\nwhose this back-up operator account,\nlet me remove that.\n\n359\n00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.440\nAnd she can do it.\n\n360\n00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.940\nAnd now the back-ups start failing on\nthat folder and it doesn't get backed up.\n\n361\n00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.110\nAnd if we don't notice it a month goes by,\na document gets deleted and\n\n362\n00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.630\nshe calls up and says hey I need you\nguys to restore this file from back-up.\n\n363\n00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.809\nWhen we go and look and it's not there.\n\n364\n00:18:56.809 --> 00:19:01.720\nAnd it's not there because of something\nshe did, but it's not her fault.\n\n365\n00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.580\nIt's our fault.\n\n366\n00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.970\nWe gave her access that\nshe shouldn't of had.\n\n367\n00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.340\nSo you've gotta make sure you do\nthat principle of least privilege.\n\n368\n00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.650\nDon't give out more permissions\nthan you absolutely need.\n\n369\n00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:11.820\nAll right.\n\n370\n00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.360\nThat being said,\nI do need to go up here to administrators.\n\n371\n00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.440\nAnd I am gonna give administrators full\ncontrol so we can do whatever we need.\n\n372\n00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.210\nNow I threw SYSTEM in the mix, and\n\n373\n00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:25.130\nif I'm using SYSTEM as a backup account,\nit really just needs the ability to read.\n\n374\n00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.510\nWell, sort of.\n\n375\n00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:32.080\nWhen you run a backup, there's a couple\nof different things that happen, right?\n\n376\n00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.460\nYou read the file,\nobviously you gotta read it to back it up.\n\n377\n00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.950\nBut then there's a file\nattribute on the file\n\n378\n00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.220\nthat identifies whether\nit's been backed up or not.\n\n379\n00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.810\nA lot of us never mess with these things,\nright, but they are there.\n\n380\n00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.930\nIf I go into a command prompt.\n\n381\n00:19:48.602 --> 00:19:55.920\nAnd I go into this folder, and\nI go into my employee handbook.\n\n382\n00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.990\nOr I guess I don't really\nhave any files in here yet.\n\n383\n00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.640\nI got access denied because I\ndon't have permissions yet.\n\n384\n00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.850\nI've been setting permissions but\nI haven't hit the apply button yet.\n\n385\n00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:05.050\nSo I got access denied.\n\n386\n00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.720\nBut when I start creating files,\nwe can just any file on this hard drive,\n\n387\n00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.230\nit'll work.\n\n388\n00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:14.330\nSo we'll take the boot manager,\nsure why not.\n\n389\n00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.350\nWhen we take a look at a file like this,\n\n390\n00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.610\nI can see there's a file\nhere called bootmgr.\n\n391\n00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:23.950\nAnd I can see that it's 398\nkilobytes in size or whatever.\n\n392\n00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:25.950\nIt's not a very big file,\nbut it's sitting there.\n\n393\n00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.640\nWell, there's additional attributes\nthat don't show up by default.\n\n394\n00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.240\nAnd if I just run A-T-T-R-I-B,\n\n395\n00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:37.660\nattrib, right, that's gonna show me\nthe files with their attributes.\n\n396\n00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.570\nAnd here's that boot manager, and\nit's got four attributes, A SHR.\n\n397\n00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:45.790\nOkay, the A is the important one\nthat I'm talking about here.\n\n398\n00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.380\nThat's the Archive bit.\n\n399\n00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:53.110\nAnd what this tells me is, was this\nfile backed up in the last full back up.\n\n400\n00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.559\nWhen you run a full back up or\n\n401\n00:20:54.559 --> 00:20:57.650\nwhen you run an incremental\nback up it will reset this bit.\n\n402\n00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:00.400\nIt will take it away and a disappears.\n\n403\n00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.150\nAnd then the next time the file\ngets changed the A gets put back.\n\n404\n00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.240\nIt gets put back which lets the system\nknow it needs to back this file up.\n\n405\n00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.370\nIt's been changed.\n\n406\n00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.340\nOkay, well, your backup software,\n\n407\n00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:14.610\nif it's doing a full backup it needs to be\nable to change that bit and take it away.\n\n408\n00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:15.240\nHey, I just did a backup.\n\n409\n00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.430\nLet me take that bit away.\n\n410\n00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:19.450\nIf we only have read access to the file,\ncan we do that?\n\n411\n00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:21.130\nNo, you can't.\n\n412\n00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.400\nBut I don't want the backup software\nto be able to edit the files.\n\n413\n00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.090\nThat's not the purpose.\n\n414\n00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:27.120\nI just want it to be able\nto edit an attribute and\n\n415\n00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.060\nthat's one of those special\npermissions I mentioned,\n\n416\n00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.790\nthe ones that are kind of tucked\naway by the operating system.\n\n417\n00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.430\nI don't think there's an easy way for\nme to get at it from this screen.\n\n418\n00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:39.600\nIf I go back to my advanced screen,\nthough, and we go into our permissions and\n\n419\n00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:45.810\nI take system, for example, and I edit and\nwe go in here, I see full control,\n\n420\n00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:50.770\nmodify, read, write, just like before, but\nI've got this show advanced permissions.\n\n421\n00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:55.290\nAnd now we get write attributes, write\nextended attributes to lead sub folders to\n\n422\n00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.450\nreally get additional things\nwe might wanna mess with.\n\n423\n00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.540\nAnd write attributes is what I would\nneed that backup software to have.\n\n424\n00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.310\nSo you've always got to be careful\nit kinda what those permissions are.\n\n425\n00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.160\nWhat your software actually needs.\n\n426\n00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when I'm teaching\nstudents in A+ I always say,\n\n427\n00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.300\nif you wanna remember the attributes,\na little saying there every file can get\n\n428\n00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:16.800\nrush Read Only Archive System Unhidden\n&gt;&gt; Good easy way to\n\n429\n00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.070\nremember those archive attributes.\n\n430\n00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:21.030\nNow about the attributes Don,\nI noticed that the Rs in there and\n\n431\n00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.586\nwe know that that stands for, or\nI know that that stands for read only.\n\n432\n00:22:23.586 --> 00:22:24.910\nCan that archive or\n\n433\n00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.030\nthat read only attribute can that\ntrump a permission on an ACL?\n\n434\n00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:29.060\n&gt;&gt; It can.\n&gt;&gt; Can cause problems?\n\n435\n00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd we're gonna talk about shared\n\n436\n00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.840\npermissions a little bit later.\n\n437\n00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.910\nYou can have permissions set at multiple\nlevels and then you get in a whole mess.\n\n438\n00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:39.410\nWhich one takes priority, which one\napplies first, how do you get access?\n\n439\n00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:42.690\nSo we'll talk about that a little later\nafter I introduce a few more of these\n\n440\n00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.320\nkinda complexities into the mix.\n\n441\n00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.100\nBut do be aware that just because\nI say somebody has write access\n\n442\n00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.420\ndoesn't guarantee they have write access.\n\n443\n00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.970\nThere can always be other things.\n\n444\n00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:54.300\nIt might be an Excel document\nthat they have write access to,\n\n445\n00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.540\nbut it's got a password on it.\n\n446\n00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.840\nSo now they open the Excel document,\nit prompts them for a password.\n\n447\n00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.190\nAnd if they can't provide the password,\nthey're not gonna open it.\n\n448\n00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.630\nAnd so it doesn't matter\nthat they have write access.\n\n449\n00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:04.420\nWell they'd get pissed off and\njust delete it I guess.\n\n450\n00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.890\nBut otherwise,\nthere's not much they can do.\n\n451\n00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:10.260\nSo there's an extra level of\nsecurity that you can implement.\n\n452\n00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.220\nAnd you've gotta be aware\nof each of those levels.\n\n453\n00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you know one of the things\nI was more specifically thinking of is\n\n454\n00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.600\nwhat if you give me full\ncontrol over that document?\n\n455\n00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.310\nBut then turn around in\nthe attribute you set to read only.\n\n456\n00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:23.160\nDoes that trump,\ndo I still have access there?\n\n457\n00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.300\nOr would that cause problems?\n\n458\n00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.660\nThinking well Don you gave me full control\nbut I can't do anything to the document.\n\n459\n00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.660\n&gt;&gt; Well that one comes down\nto the ingenuity of the user.\n\n460\n00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.570\nSo technically you wouldn't\nbe able to change it.\n\n461\n00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:33.820\nIt's read only.\n\n462\n00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.920\nBut because you have full control,\nyou can go and\n\n463\n00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.380\nremove the read-only attribute, right?\n\n464\n00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.639\nWhich isn't hard for a user,\nthat attribute's easy, right?\n\n465\n00:23:40.639 --> 00:23:45.328\nCuz you can just browse right to the file,\nand you pull up its properties, and shoot,\n\n466\n00:23:45.328 --> 00:23:49.464\nI'm already in my properties, but it's\njust a little check mark in a little box\n\n467\n00:23:49.464 --> 00:23:53.479\nright there to remove the read-only\nattribute itself, easy enough to do but\n\n468\n00:23:53.479 --> 00:23:55.493\nthe user would have to know to do that.\n\n469\n00:23:55.493 --> 00:23:58.626\nSo that's more like security through\nannoyance than actual security through\n\n470\n00:23:58.626 --> 00:23:59.249\nenforcement.\n\n471\n00:23:59.249 --> 00:24:02.633\nJust be aware that there are multiple\nlevels that we have to deal with this\n\n472\n00:24:02.633 --> 00:24:03.137\nstuff on.\n\n473\n00:24:03.137 --> 00:24:05.470\nSo as we get out permissions kinda set,\n\n474\n00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.310\nwe finally get it to the way\nthat we want it to be.\n\n475\n00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:12.210\nNow I've got system has read access,\nWes has read access,\n\n476\n00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:15.692\nJane has modify,\nadministrators have full control.\n\n477\n00:24:15.692 --> 00:24:17.780\nThat's kinda the way\nthat I want this to be.\n\n478\n00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.720\nI've been setting this on\nthe Employee Handbook folder, right?\n\n479\n00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.780\nSo on the folder itself.\n\n480\n00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:27.990\nSo when I go into the Employee Handbook\nfolder and I start to create something.\n\n481\n00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:33.090\nLike if I come in, I create a text\ndocument, and I'll this Handbook, and\n\n482\n00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:37.160\nthen we maybe stick a day on it,\nI wanna say the 18th.\n\n483\n00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.550\nSo I'll just give it a date and\nwe get that set, right.\n\n484\n00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:44.660\nSo here's my first\naddition to this handbook.\n\n485\n00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.600\nWell, I didn't set\npermissions on this file, but\n\n486\n00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.764\nit inherited what came from the parent.\n\n487\n00:24:49.764 --> 00:24:54.620\nSo if I go into my properties and security\nI'll see in here where system has read\n\n488\n00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:58.570\naccess, Wes has read access, Jane has\nmodify administrators have full control.\n\n489\n00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:00.870\nIt brought those permissions with it.\n\n490\n00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:01.750\nEverybody got what they needed.\n\n491\n00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:07.330\nOkay, now that's just one folder.\n\n492\n00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:08.620\nThen I've got my other folders, right?\n\n493\n00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:09.750\nNetwork documentation.\n\n494\n00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.170\nThis one's kind of the opposite, right?\n\n495\n00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.710\nOn network documentation,\n\n496\n00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:18.370\nI probably want Wes to have full control,\nor at least modify.\n\n497\n00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:20.870\nAnd Jane,\nmaybe I just give her read access or\n\n498\n00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:22.710\nmaybe I don't give Jane access at all.\n\n499\n00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.250\nDoes Jane really need access\nto the network documentation?\n\n500\n00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:30.210\nShe works in HR, she needs access to\npayroll and vacation calendars and\n\n501\n00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.220\nall the things that HR deals with.\n\n502\n00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.650\nHR's not dealing with IP\naddress assignments and\n\n503\n00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:37.750\nrouter backup configurations and\nstuff like that.\n\n504\n00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:40.140\nSo she may not need access to this at all.\n\n505\n00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:44.450\nSo I'm gonna go in here and I'm gonna\nremove the permissions that are on there.\n\n506\n00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:49.850\nAnd then I'll go back and assign who\nit is that I want to have access.\n\n507\n00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:54.660\nAnd so I'm gonna give Wes access and\nso on, right?\n\n508\n00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:59.090\nSo I'll just add administrators and\nkeep this kind of short.\n\n509\n00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.340\nI'm running low on time.\n\n510\n00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.800\nSo I'm gonna add that one in.\n\n511\n00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.600\nAnd there we go, all right?\n\n512\n00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.120\nNow once that's in place\nnow I can come through and\n\n513\n00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.640\nsay, Wes gets modify,\nadministrators get full control.\n\n514\n00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.840\nWes is probably an administrator so he'll\nprobably end up with full control anyway.\n\n515\n00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.570\nBut just because you're in\nthe IT department doesn't mean\n\n516\n00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.080\nyou're an administrator, right?\n\n517\n00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.920\nYou might be at the help desk and\nyou need to read the documentation but\n\n518\n00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.920\nyou're not the one who writes it.\n\n519\n00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.340\nSo you get different levels of access.\n\n520\n00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.170\nSo I can come in and I can set that up.\n\n521\n00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.530\nAnd now those permissions\nare assigned too, okay?\n\n522\n00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.040\nOnce that's done, I'm good to go.\n\n523\n00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.440\nI've got my permissions set, everybody\ncan access what they need to access.\n\n524\n00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.470\nBut the way I've done it here\nis not really the best way.\n\n525\n00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.600\nThe biggest challenge that I'm gonna\nhave here is when I add a new employee.\n\n526\n00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.300\nSo let's say I go and\nhire another IT person.\n\n527\n00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.140\nSo Wes is just getting overburdened,\nso we hire somebody else, right?\n\n528\n00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.020\nI create an account for\nmyself, right, I need access.\n\n529\n00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.030\nSo I'm gonna create a dpezet account,\nright?\n\n530\n00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:56.270\nWell, I can go over here into my users,\nand I can create a new users,\n\n531\n00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:01.460\nwhich I'll create as dpezet,\nand if I can spell my own name.\n\n532\n00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:07.830\nAnd I'll give myself a password,\nand get that set.\n\n533\n00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.730\nThere we go and so now I've got a user\naccount, and I'm gonna be working along\n\n534\n00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.580\nside Wes and so I need to get\nthe same permissions that Wes has.\n\n535\n00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:17.990\nHow do I get the same\npermissions that Wes has?\n\n536\n00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.900\nWell, I've got to go to every folder.\n\n537\n00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.740\nI've got to pull up the properties,\nI've got to go to security,\n\n538\n00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.160\nI've got to look at what Wes has.\n\n539\n00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:31.520\nAnd then I've got to add my self in,\nso I'm gonna add Don Pezet.\n\n540\n00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:37.320\nAnd I need to give myself\nthe same permissions that he had,\n\n541\n00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.780\nwhich I've already screwed up there.\n\n542\n00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:42.590\nSo I'll set that and then I need to go to\nthe next folder, and the next folder, and\n\n543\n00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:44.980\nthe next folder and assign all of this.\n\n544\n00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.490\nAnd I keep talking about folders.\n\n545\n00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.990\nWe can assign permissions not\njust on folders, but on files.\n\n546\n00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:52.550\nIt can be done on printers,\nso who's allowed to print,\n\n547\n00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:56.770\nwho's not allowed to print, who can cut\nto the front of the print queue line.\n\n548\n00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:59.060\nAnd some of those are all\nthings that we can protect.\n\n549\n00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.500\nYou can even do things\nlike peripheral devices.\n\n550\n00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:07.590\nYou might have external hard drives or\nUSB ports that you wanna restrict.\n\n551\n00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:12.950\nWe can do things that are not an item but\n\n552\n00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:17.300\nan action like who's allowed\nto shut down the computer?\n\n553\n00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.550\nWho's allowed to change the clock?\n\n554\n00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:21.640\nWe can set permissions on items like that.\n\n555\n00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:26.810\nThat's all part of creating access control\nis defining who has access to what.\n\n556\n00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:31.140\nBut now that I've kind of defined it here,\nit's kind of a pain to work with.\n\n557\n00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.320\nEvery time I hire an IT person,\n\n558\n00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.960\nI've gotta go to all these different\nplaces, these printers, these folders,\n\n559\n00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:41.510\nthese files, these actions and set those\npermissions and that becomes a nightmare.\n\n560\n00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:47.900\nSo instead of doing it per person,\nyou should always do it based on a role.\n\n561\n00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.950\nA role, what role does that\nperson perform in the company?\n\n562\n00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:52.700\nSo are they an accountant?\n\n563\n00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.002\nAre they an HR?\n\n564\n00:28:55.002 --> 00:28:56.360\nAre they an IT?\n\n565\n00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.510\nNot who are they, what's their name,\nbut what do they do.\n\n566\n00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.030\nWhat's their job?\n\n567\n00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:06.190\nAnd when we know jobs you can start\nassigning permissions based on that and\n\n568\n00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:07.770\nit makes life so much easier.\n\n569\n00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:10.090\nSo for example, I was in the user section.\n\n570\n00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:16.480\nI can go under groups and I'm gonna\ncreate a group called IT Department.\n\n571\n00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.510\nAnd any time I hire somebody in the IT\nDepartment I will put them in this group.\n\n572\n00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:25.840\nRight now it's empty so\nI'm gonna add Wes, and myself, okay?\n\n573\n00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.180\nSo we're just gonna get\nourselves put in here.\n\n574\n00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:32.750\nAnd then I'll create another\ngroup called Human Resources.\n\n575\n00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:36.510\nAnd anytime I hire somebody in\nHuman Resources, I can put them in here.\n\n576\n00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:40.860\nSo I'll add Jane, and\nnow she's in here, okay?\n\n577\n00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.360\nAnd so I've created these groups.\n\n578\n00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.750\nAnd you'll see where Microsoft has\ncreated a bunch of groups already\n\n579\n00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:49.340\nlike the Backup Operator's group,\nthe Administrator's group,\n\n580\n00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.550\nthe Event Log Readers and so on.\n\n581\n00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:55.040\nThese are roles that people perform.\n\n582\n00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.740\nWhat is your job responsibility?\n\n583\n00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:58.980\nI work in the IT department.\n\n584\n00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:02.028\nOr I'm an accountant, I'm in HR.\n\n585\n00:30:02.028 --> 00:30:07.790\nAnd now when I create folders like this I\ncan go to that employee handbook folder\n\n586\n00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:12.020\nand instead of giving permissions\nto an individual person.\n\n587\n00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.000\nI can take Jane out, so\nI'm just gonna remove Jane.\n\n588\n00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.890\nSo we'll pull her right out of there and\nI'm gonna add the Human Resources group.\n\n589\n00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.880\nAnd when I add the human resources\ngroup I can give the entire group\n\n590\n00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.850\nmodified permissions.\n\n591\n00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:31.620\nAnd then I can go down to\nnetwork documentation or\n\n592\n00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:35.990\nwherever and\nI can assign that entire group.\n\n593\n00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:40.660\nBy doing that anytime I hire\na human resources person\n\n594\n00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:43.450\nI can just put them in the HR group.\n\n595\n00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:47.720\nAnd once they're in the HR group, they get\naccess to all the stuff that's out there.\n\n596\n00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:51.070\nAnd I didn't have to go and modify each\nindividual folder or each printer,\n\n597\n00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:54.110\neach action, each file,\neach external device.\n\n598\n00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:56.580\nI don't have to do that,\nthey're in the group.\n\n599\n00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.530\nAnd if somebody gets a transfer,\nmaybe Jane really loves IT.\n\n600\n00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:03.590\nAnd she gets tired of the HR circus and\nsays, hey I'm getting out and\n\n601\n00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:04.790\nI'm gonna go take over the IT department.\n\n602\n00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:06.560\nSo now she's vice president of IT.\n\n603\n00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.980\nWell she needs to get\naccess to all the IT stuff.\n\n604\n00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:12.550\nI just move her from the HR group,\nover to the IT group, and\n\n605\n00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:15.430\nnow she's our CIO or\nwhatever her title is.\n\n606\n00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:17.980\nAnd she gets all that access, and\nall I had to do was change her group.\n\n607\n00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.230\nIt makes management so much easier.\n\n608\n00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:21.760\n&gt;&gt; Don, I've heard this term before.\n\n609\n00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.660\nMaybe this is exactly what\nyou're explaining here,\n\n610\n00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:27.340\nanother acronym that I'll throw at you,\nRBAC, role-based access control.\n\n611\n00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:28.330\nIs that what this is?\n\n612\n00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:30.730\nIs this a form of\nrole-based access control?\n\n613\n00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:32.930\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah,\nand we're doing groups.\n\n614\n00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:37.200\nThere's ways to do role-based access\ncontrol without using groups, and so\n\n615\n00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.590\nthat's why they had\nthe two different terms.\n\n616\n00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:41.450\nYou'll hear some people, like me,\nwhere they'll say roles and\n\n617\n00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:43.050\ngroups interchangeably.\n\n618\n00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:46.490\nBut sometimes you have software\nthat defines a role and\n\n619\n00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:48.370\nit's not an actual group\nin the operating system.\n\n620\n00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:49.880\nSo that's where that separation is.\n\n621\n00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.100\nThe way I'm using it here, it's the same.\n\n622\n00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.420\nRoles and groups are the same.\n\n623\n00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:56.580\nI have a role for an employee,\nyou work in IT, and\n\n624\n00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:00.840\nI have a group that corresponds to that\nrole, and so I'm using them the same.\n\n625\n00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.000\nBut they could be different,\nI could have a role that was\n\n626\n00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:10.100\nable to read the employee hand book.\n\n627\n00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.270\nSo I might create a group called\nable to read the employee handbook.\n\n628\n00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.060\nAnd I give that permissions.\n\n629\n00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.080\nWhat's my role in the company,\nwhat's my job.\n\n630\n00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.780\nMy job is not able to read\nthe employee handbook but\n\n631\n00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.970\nI have a group called able to\ncreate the employee handbook so\n\n632\n00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.040\nthat's where roles and groups start\nto separate but I use them together.\n\n633\n00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:31.480\nI might have ten different roles that are\nall able to read the employee handbook,\n\n634\n00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.680\nand at that point you're creating\nwhat are called nested groups.\n\n635\n00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:39.080\nA user will go into a group that\ncorresponds to their role, their role will\n\n636\n00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.850\ngo into another group that corresponds\nto the permission that I'm giving them.\n\n637\n00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:46.440\nAnd then that final group will get\npermissions on the resource they're\n\n638\n00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.030\ntrying to access.\n\n639\n00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.290\nSo it's getting a little complex, right?\n\n640\n00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:52.690\nBut when you build it out that way,\nit makes expandability and\n\n641\n00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:55.280\ngrowth become trivial and easy.\n\n642\n00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.160\nManaging permissions on a per\nuser basis is a nightmare.\n\n643\n00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.710\nAnd if your company has more\nthan ten employees it gets to be\n\n644\n00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.940\nreally challenging and really frustrating.\n\n645\n00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:07.430\nBut if you're using groups and rolls\nproperly you could have tens of thousands\n\n646\n00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:11.160\nof employees and be hiring and firing on\na daily basis and it's not a big deal.\n\n647\n00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.560\nIt's just really easy to move people in.\n\n648\n00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.120\nAll right, now I still have more\nto talk about on permissions.\n\n649\n00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.830\nWe've been kind of focused on permissions\nassigned right to a resource.\n\n650\n00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:24.210\nI wanna talk about share permissions,\nand permissions conflict\n\n651\n00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.840\nwhich what Wes was asking about earlier,\nbut in a lot of time so\n\n652\n00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.840\nwhat will do is we'll tackle those in\na part two, get a chance to see them.\n\n653\n00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:35.070\nBut what we seen right here in\npart one is core fundamental\n\n654\n00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:39.750\nprocess assigning permission, and\nI did it Windows the same in Linux and\n\n655\n00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:43.680\nUnix, same over Mac OS that\nothers process for doing this.\n\n656\n00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.008\nBut the steps might be little different,\nbut\n\n657\n00:33:46.008 --> 00:33:49.070\nthe theory of what you're\napplying is the same.\n\n658\n00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.094\n&gt;&gt; All right,\na lot of great information there, Don.\n\n659\n00:33:51.094 --> 00:33:53.460\nLook forward to seeing you\nback in there part two.\n\n660\n00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.260\nHowever, as you've already mentioned,\ntime to wrap this one up.\n\n661\n00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.469\nBut before we do, got any final words that\nyou might like to impart to our viewers?\n\n662\n00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.080\n&gt;&gt; It's usually gonna be faster to\nassign permissions to a person if\n\n663\n00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:03.960\nyou're in a hurry.\n\n664\n00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.760\nDon't make that mistake.\n\n665\n00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.870\nTake the extra time, create the groups,\nput the users in the groups.\n\n666\n00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:11.120\nIt'll save you a ton of time down\nthe road, it makes life so much easier.\n\n667\n00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.470\nDefinitely take the time to do it right.\n\n668\n00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:15.150\n&gt;&gt; All right,\ngreat words of wisdom from Don Pezet.\n\n669\n00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.942\nThanks for\nbeing here in the studios with us Don, and\n\n670\n00:34:16.942 --> 00:34:18.460\nthank you to the viewer\nwatching out there.\n\n671\n00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.900\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n672\n00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:22.570\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n673\n00:34:22.570 -->

00:00:08.017\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.017 --> 00:00:11.247\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.247 --> 00:00:14.630\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.240\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're continuing through our\n\n7\n00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.950\nseries in CompTIA's Server Plus SK0-004,\n\n8\n00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.390\ncoming back with a part two\non logical access control.\n\n9\n00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.340\nAnd here to help us wrap up these topics\nis none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.300\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.500\n&gt;&gt; I am doing just swell, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.580\nReady to dive right back in and\nwrap up just a few little loose\n\n13\n00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.280\nends that I had from last\nepisode that we didn't get to.\n\n14\n00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.490\nIn the last episode we focused\non logical access control.\n\n15\n00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.350\nWe talked about user accounts and\ngroups and how they kind of worked.\n\n16\n00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.600\nAnd we talked about how we can apply\npermissions to, I did files and folders,\n\n17\n00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.780\nbut again, we could have done printers or\nother resources.\n\n18\n00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.370\nI'll show you some other\nexamples later in the episode.\n\n19\n00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.500\nSo that's one loose end\nthat I need to get to.\n\n20\n00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.280\nBut the other thing that\nwe didn't quite get to was,\n\n21\n00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.310\nwhen permissions stack together.\n\n22\n00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.280\nAnd this happens a lot,\nwhere permissions stack together and\n\n23\n00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.020\ncause weird things to happen.\n\n24\n00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.890\nSo we need to understand\nhow permissions kind of mix\n\n25\n00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.980\nto create the final resultant set.\n\n26\n00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:18.880\nSo in the last episode, the permissions\nI were doing were NTFS File Permissions.\n\n27\n00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.190\nWhen I set these, so we'll just go\njump right back into those folders.\n\n28\n00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.810\nI had a folder like\nthe Employee Handbook Folder.\n\n29\n00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.780\nAnd in the Employee Handbook Folder,\n\n30\n00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.470\nI gave Wes read-only access\nto the Employee Handbook, and\n\n31\n00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.070\nI gave the human resources department,\nwrite access to it.\n\n32\n00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.160\nAnd I was doing that.\n\n33\n00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.060\nAnd those permissions are being stored\nas part of the NTFS file system.\n\n34\n00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.070\nThe file systems are what's\ncontrolling the permissions.\n\n35\n00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.290\nIt's important to understand that\nbecause not every file system supports\n\n36\n00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.420\npermissions.\n\n37\n00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.370\nFor example, if you have FAT32,\ndoesn't support file permissions.\n\n38\n00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.150\nSo you can't set folder permissions,\nyou can pull up the properties on a folder\n\n39\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.670\nthat's on a fat 32 drive,\nit doesn't even have a permissions tab.\n\n40\n00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.580\nAnd in the Linux and Unix, same thing.\n\n41\n00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.210\nIf you're doing UFS, or EXT two,\nthree, four, they support permissions.\n\n42\n00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.190\nBut if you're using some of the fringe\nfile systems that are available,\n\n43\n00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.760\nthey might not, and now you can't\nset those file level permissions,\n\n44\n00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.760\njust everybody has full control.\n\n45\n00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.700\nThat's the default when it's like that.\n\n46\n00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.800\nSo there's other systems of permissions\nthat we can lay on top that you can use\n\n47\n00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.380\nwhen you don't have permissions, or\n\n48\n00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.650\nyou can use in addition to\npermissions that you've already got.\n\n49\n00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.600\nIn the Windows world, the best\nexample of that are share permissions.\n\n50\n00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.250\nWhen I share a folder on the network,\n\n51\n00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.220\nI get an entirely separate\nset of permissions.\n\n52\n00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.230\nLet me show you.\n\n53\n00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.240\nSo if I take my\nEmployee Handbook folder here.\n\n54\n00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.500\nIn the last episode,\nI was pulling up its properties and\n\n55\n00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.310\nI was going in the security tab and\nI was setting permissions.\n\n56\n00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.340\nHere you can see where Wes and\nI have permissions.\n\n57\n00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.020\nAnd the human resources\ndepartment I had added in.\n\n58\n00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.390\nSo this is where we were\ngetting our permissions.\n\n59\n00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.490\nAnd I was in the process of\nremoving individual users.\n\n60\n00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.730\nSo getting Wes Nye out of there and\n\n61\n00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.430\nadding in the, oops,\ndidn't I call it IT Department?\n\n62\n00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.300\nWell whatever it was.\n\n63\n00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.510\nSo adding in the different groups\nthat I wanted to have access\n\n64\n00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.330\nto be able to do that.\n\n65\n00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.110\nSo I guess I'll just put Wes Nye back\nin and create the IT Department group.\n\n66\n00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.221\nBut once we set these permissions,\nthese are part of file systems and\n\n67\n00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:25.770\nthey're always going take effect.\n\n68\n00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.450\nBut if I don't have file system\npermissions, this is not an option for\n\n69\n00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.720\nme, in which case I can\ngo to the sharing tab.\n\n70\n00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.080\nUnder the sharing tab notice how this\nnetwork path right now is not shared.\n\n71\n00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.930\nI'm not sharing this file on the network.\n\n72\n00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.980\nSo that means that somebody would\nhave to physically come and\n\n73\n00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.490\nsit down in front of the server.\n\n74\n00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.839\nThey'll have to log in as themselves and\nbrowse to the C drive and\n\n75\n00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:49.080\nbrowse to the folder that I created.\n\n76\n00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.990\nRight there C:/sharedocuments.\n\n77\n00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.890\nAnd they'll be able to\nget to the document.\n\n78\n00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.130\nWell, if I had 10,000 employees and\nthis is the file server in my data center,\n\n79\n00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.290\nhow many employees are gonna walk\nup to it and sit down and log in?\n\n80\n00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.810\nNone, they don't have access to it.\n\n81\n00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.580\nThey don't have physical\naccess to that server.\n\n82\n00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.390\nIt's locked away in the data center.\n\n83\n00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.690\nSo they're gonna access\nit via the network.\n\n84\n00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.310\nAnd in Windows,\n\n85\n00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.780\nyou can do share permissions that apply\nwhen somebody comes in over the network.\n\n86\n00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.424\nAnd these were introduced way back\nin Windows 3.1 as part of the whole\n\n87\n00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:21.430\nLAN manager solution that Intel created,\nMicrosoft bought.\n\n88\n00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.460\nSo this is really old-school technology,\n\n89\n00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.410\nbecause you didn't have file\nsystem permissions back then.\n\n90\n00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.790\nToday we use NTFS for\nmost of our file systems in Windows.\n\n91\n00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.360\nIn Linux use EXT4 or\nXFS or BTRFS one of those.\n\n92\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.260\nAnd they all support permissions.\n\n93\n00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.850\nAnd so\nwe don't need shared permissions anymore.\n\n94\n00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.310\nBut they still exist.\n\n95\n00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.940\nIn the Linux and Unix world, you have NFS.\n\n96\n00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.460\nThe network file system.\n\n97\n00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.820\nAnd in NFS you can define permissions,\n\n98\n00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.150\nregardless of what your\nfile system actually is.\n\n99\n00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.410\nIn Windows, you have share permissions.\n\n100\n00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.340\nIn Mac OS you have share permissions,\nsame thing.\n\n101\n00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.240\nIt's using Apple file protocol,\nbut it's the same thing.\n\n102\n00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.990\nSo you have these extra-level permissions\nthat are independent of the file system.\n\n103\n00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.250\nSo I can come in here and\nI can say I wanna share this.\n\n104\n00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.900\nSo I'll tell it I'm gonna share it.\n\n105\n00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.070\nAnd when I share it,\nhere's who I can share it with.\n\n106\n00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.650\nAnd look, it's got me, and\nWes, and Human Resources.\n\n107\n00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.610\nWe're already in the list.\n\n108\n00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.530\nBut if I cancel that and\nI go to advanced sharing, and\n\n109\n00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.800\nI say I wanna share the folder,\nthe Employee Handbook folder, and\n\n110\n00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.490\nI go to permissions,\nlook who has permissions.\n\n111\n00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.450\nEveryone has read.\n\n112\n00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.000\nBut that's not what we said.\n\n113\n00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.820\nWe said so\nthat human resources had modify.\n\n114\n00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.340\nAnd Wes and I had read,\nand there was no everyone.\n\n115\n00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.330\nEveryone, that's everyone,\neven users that haven't logged in.\n\n116\n00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.000\nUnauthenticated users, that's not good.\n\n117\n00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.180\nWell, I think they changed that\nin Windows Server 2012 r2.\n\n118\n00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.550\nWhere everyone now does\nstill require a login.\n\n119\n00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.330\nBut if the guest account is active,\n\n120\n00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.270\nthen everyone does include\nunauthenticated users.\n\n121\n00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.470\nWhen I was in the user panel, you probably\nnoticed the guest account was disabled\n\n122\n00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.890\nby default so it's necessarily everyone.\n\n123\n00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.670\nBut either way, this is different than\nthe permissions I saw a moment ago.\n\n124\n00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.410\nAnd the reason is, the permissions I saw\na moment ago were the NTFS permissions,\n\n125\n00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.150\nthe ones that were attached to the file.\n\n126\n00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.800\nAnd when I share it out on the network,\nI have share permissions.\n\n127\n00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.840\nAnd they may not be the same,\nthey may be different.\n\n128\n00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.820\nIf I were to share this out like it is\nright now, everyone is allowed to read.\n\n129\n00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.620\nAnd I just hit okay.\n\n130\n00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.140\nAll right, that's now a shared folder.\n\n131\n00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.940\nSo it's shared out.\n\n132\n00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.090\nAnd I shouldn't have closed that so fast\nbecause if I pull the properties back up,\n\n133\n00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.968\nand I go into sharing I can\nsee there is a network path.\n\n134\n00:06:34.968 --> 00:06:39.331\nThis is VM-DON is the name of the server,\n\\Employee Handbook.\n\n135\n00:06:39.331 --> 00:06:40.840\nAll right, so there it is.\n\n136\n00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.340\nIt's shared out.\n\n137\n00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.650\nIf somebody accesses it via the network,\n\n138\n00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.480\nI don't care who they are because\neveryone has read access.\n\n139\n00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.190\nSo everyone will get in there and\nbe able to read.\n\n140\n00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.880\nNow for Wes and I, that works out great,\nwe had read access anyway.\n\n141\n00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.050\nBut for Jane, it's not so great.\n\n142\n00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.840\nIf Jane comes in over the network, she's\nsupposed to have modified permissions.\n\n143\n00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.460\nShe is the vice president\nof human resources,\n\n144\n00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.800\nshe should be able to modify this.\n\n145\n00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.490\nAnd on the file it says that.\n\n146\n00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.590\nIf I go to my security here and\nI find Jane,\n\n147\n00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.230\nJane is in the human resources group and\nit's taking a moment to populate.\n\n148\n00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:22.360\nWindows does this thing where every user\naccount and every group has a Security ID,\n\n149\n00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.830\nor a SID, it's that long number you just\nsaw on the screen for a moment there.\n\n150\n00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.840\nAnd then it maps a name to it, so\nthe name was Human Resources, but\n\n151\n00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.830\nit had to look that up real quick in\nthe background, and it took it a moment.\n\n152\n00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.250\nThe reason it does that\nSecurity Identifier\n\n153\n00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.180\nis because I might need\nto change the name.\n\n154\n00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.620\nLet's say, here in the United States\nit's pretty common that\n\n155\n00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.500\nwhen a couple gets married the woman\nassumes the last name of the man.\n\n156\n00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.314\nNot always, but\nit's a pretty common thing.\n\n157\n00:07:49.314 --> 00:07:53.378\nWell, if you have an employee and\ntheir last name changes,\n\n158\n00:07:53.378 --> 00:07:57.848\nI have this user account and\nif I have to create a new user account,\n\n159\n00:07:57.848 --> 00:08:00.394\nI have to reset all the permissions.\n\n160\n00:08:00.394 --> 00:08:02.057\nIt's gonna be a nightmare.\n\n161\n00:08:02.057 --> 00:08:03.348\nWell, Windows doesn't care.\n\n162\n00:08:03.348 --> 00:08:05.117\nWindows is a security identifier.\n\n163\n00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:09.140\nI can change the name to whatever I want,\nand all the permissions stay the same.\n\n164\n00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.160\nAll the file access stays the same,\nit's no big deal.\n\n165\n00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.660\nA name is just a name, it's what we see.\n\n166\n00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.480\nAnd in the background there's a SID.\n\n167\n00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.480\nIn Unix and in Linux,\nyou have a UID, a user id.\n\n168\n00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.080\nSame idea, you have this number.\n\n169\n00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.380\nThat's what's important.\n\n170\n00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.650\nThe name, it's just a name, it's there.\n\n171\n00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.420\nBut the UID is what's really important.\n\n172\n00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.940\nSo we can rename and change it.\n\n173\n00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.030\nSo that's why we had that long number for\na moment.\n\n174\n00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.503\nBut when I look here I can see Human\nResources has Modify permissions on this\n\n175\n00:08:35.503 --> 00:08:36.076\nfolder.\n\n176\n00:08:36.076 --> 00:08:40.154\nBut if Jane logs in and comes in over\nthe network to get to this folder.\n\n177\n00:08:40.154 --> 00:08:43.139\nShe's only gonna have read access,\nall right.\n\n178\n00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:48.780\nBecause the sharing permissions\nstated that everyone has read access,\n\n179\n00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:52.510\nand there's no exceptions there, right?\n\n180\n00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.460\nSo that's gonna be a problem.\n\n181\n00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.560\nIf she walks into the server room and\nlogs in locally on that server,\n\n182\n00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.870\nshe'll be able to modify it,\nb ut not via the network.\n\n183\n00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.120\n&gt;&gt; Don in the first part here,\n\n184\n00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:07.190\nwhen you were showing us the ACL and\nyou added modified to a user account.\n\n185\n00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.420\nI noticed that it, and you mentioned this.\n\n186\n00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.920\nIt gives you all of\nthe permissions below it, right.\n\n187\n00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So they accumulate.\n\n188\n00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.760\nHowever, it seems now when you're\ncomparing share permissions to\n\n189\n00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.760\nthose file permissions it seems like\nit's the polar opposite of that.\n\n190\n00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.090\nThat you don't get all\nof those permissions,\n\n191\n00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.710\nyou actually only get\nthe lowest permission.\n\n192\n00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.280\n&gt;&gt; Well you have to remember,\nthese are two completely separate systems.\n\n193\n00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.750\nThat one system might not exist.\n\n194\n00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:33.540\nI might be running on FAT32 drives and\nI don't even have file permissions, right?\n\n195\n00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.180\nAnd so these share permissions\nbecome the only thing I have.\n\n196\n00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.414\nOr I might have files permissions and\nI'm not sharing the folder, so\n\n197\n00:09:39.414 --> 00:09:41.324\nI don't have these share permissions.\n\n198\n00:09:41.324 --> 00:09:44.150\nThey're two completely separate things.\n\n199\n00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:50.630\nBut if I do have them both, they can\nconflict like I'm seeing right here.\n\n200\n00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:51.870\nI'm seeing a conflict.\n\n201\n00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:56.290\nIf Jane comes in over the network the file\nsystem says she should have modify.\n\n202\n00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.960\nThe share says she only has read.\n\n203\n00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.730\nWhat does she actually get?\n\n204\n00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.430\nWell that's up to\nthe operating system vendor.\n\n205\n00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.150\nWhoever wrote your operating\nsystem makes a decision.\n\n206\n00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.390\nAnd so in this Microsoft made a decision.\n\n207\n00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:11.540\nAnd they said well if there's a conflict,\nshame on you.\n\n208\n00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.410\nShould have done it right [LAUGH].\n\n209\n00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:18.948\nBut if there is a conflict we're gonna\ngive this most restrictive permissions.\n\n210\n00:10:18.948 --> 00:10:21.850\nWhichever one is the most restrictive,\nwe'll assume that one's correct.\n\n211\n00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:26.288\nBecause we'd rather give out too little\ninformation than give out too much\n\n212\n00:10:26.288 --> 00:10:27.210\ninformation.\n\n213\n00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.290\nAnd that's a great decision on their part.\n\n214\n00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.040\n&gt;&gt; Now when, Don,\nwhen you say restrictive,\n\n215\n00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.039\ndoes that matter which\nside of the tracks I'm on?\n\n216\n00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:37.019\nWhether the more restrictive permission\nis a file permission or, in this case,\n\n217\n00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:37.787\nyour example.\n\n218\n00:10:37.787 --> 00:10:40.149\nThe more restrictive\npermission at least for Jane,\n\n219\n00:10:40.149 --> 00:10:43.230\n[LAUGH] is the fact that the shared\npermissions are more restricted.\n\n220\n00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.810\nIt doesn't matter what side of the tracks\nI'm at when it comes to the restrictive\n\n221\n00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:47.790\nnature of these permissions?\n\n222\n00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.770\n&gt;&gt; No, it's just whichever is tighter,\nthat's the one which is gonna do it.\n\n223\n00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.230\nAnd so like you said it, in my example for\n\n224\n00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.930\nshared permissions that\nare more restrictive,\n\n225\n00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.230\nthat's the one that's gonna win.\n\n226\n00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.180\nBut it could have been\nthe other way around.\n\n227\n00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.990\nMy share might be set to full control.\n\n228\n00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.990\nAnd then on the file system\nit's set to read only.\n\n229\n00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.470\nAnd then the file system would win.\n\n230\n00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.560\nAnd you would enable ready only.\n\n231\n00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.850\nYou're gonna get whichever\none is more restrictive.\n\n232\n00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.800\nIn fact, let me tell you guys my secret.\n\n233\n00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.710\nIf you're battling multiple different\nlogical axis controls like this\n\n234\n00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.020\nit's frustrating, it's hard to\ndeal with a conflict like that.\n\n235\n00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:24.170\nAnd you don't necessarily want to disable\none set, I don't wanna not use NTFS.\n\n236\n00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.700\nBecause NTFS is really handy, has a lot of\nextra features that go beyond permissions.\n\n237\n00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.250\nBut at the same time, I have to use share\npermissions if I'm gonna share it on\n\n238\n00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.610\nthe network I've gotta have them.\n\n239\n00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.190\nSo how do I avoid conflicts like these,\nand make it where when I go to\n\n240\n00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.380\ntroubleshoot them,\nI'm gonna go to two different places?\n\n241\n00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.150\nWhen I assign permissions, I don't wanna\nhave to go to two different places.\n\n242\n00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:46.250\nWell, my solution is whenever I share\na folder, I always take the folder and\n\n243\n00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.860\ngive everyone full control.\n\n244\n00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.340\nAnd I know that sounds crazy, you're like,\n\n245\n00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.960\nwait a minute Don, you're gonna give\neverybody full control over the share?\n\n246\n00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.290\nYes, yes I am.\n\n247\n00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:59.790\nBecause I know that the final permissions\nthey get are gonna be whatever's the most\n\n248\n00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.600\nrestrictive, right?\n\n249\n00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:07.350\nSo if Wes comes along and\nhits the share, he gets full control.\n\n250\n00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:11.410\nIf Jane comes along, she hits the share,\nshe gets full control.\n\n251\n00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.960\nBut then,\nunder the share are the file permissions.\n\n252\n00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.350\nAnd at the final level\nJane has only modify and\n\n253\n00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:21.270\nat the final level Wes only has read.\n\n254\n00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.810\nAnd so Wes ends up with read and\nJane ends up with modify.\n\n255\n00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.730\nThat they get the most restrictive\npermission was assigned to them\n\n256\n00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.840\nbetween the two.\n\n257\n00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.960\nAnd so\nnow I get the end result that I wanted.\n\n258\n00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.640\nAnd I didn't have to mess around with\npermissions here at the share level.\n\n259\n00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.770\nIt was all pulled from the file.\n\n260\n00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.965\n&gt;&gt; Don, and from a troubleshooting\nperspective, that almost seems like too.\n\n261\n00:12:39.965 --> 00:12:42.890\nNow, when you're troubleshooting,\nwhy a permission isn't applying.\n\n262\n00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:44.967\nOr the level of access is\na little bit more or less,\n\n263\n00:12:44.967 --> 00:12:46.560\nmaybe a little bit more restrictive.\n\n264\n00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.148\nYou only have one set of\npermissions to troubleshoot.\n\n265\n00:12:49.148 --> 00:12:51.320\nYou don't have to figure\nout this interaction.\n\n266\n00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.370\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so you might ask yourself.\n\n267\n00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.200\nWell Don, that sounds like a great idea.\n\n268\n00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.362\nWhy does Microsoft even\nbother with the two, right?\n\n269\n00:12:57.362 --> 00:13:00.811\nAnd just remember,\nMicrosoft still supports FAT32.\n\n270\n00:13:00.811 --> 00:13:01.741\nAnd they support XFAT,\n\n271\n00:13:01.741 --> 00:13:05.470\nthey support some of these different file\nsystems that don't have permissions.\n\n272\n00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:09.500\nSo they've got to be able to support that,\nthey need to have the two different sets.\n\n273\n00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.410\nBut Microsoft knows what I know,\n\n274\n00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.040\nthey're the ones that wrote the stuff,\nthey know way more than I do.\n\n275\n00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:19.830\nSo when I initially shared this out,\nI did Advanced Sharing.\n\n276\n00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.917\nHad I done the Simple Sharing,\nif I'd just gone to this regular Share,\n\n277\n00:13:22.917 --> 00:13:24.984\nsee how it already\npopulated out permissions?\n\n278\n00:13:24.984 --> 00:13:29.106\nAnd that was because it was\ngoing to do what I did.\n\n279\n00:13:29.106 --> 00:13:31.350\nIt was going to say,\nforget the share permissions,\n\n280\n00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.580\nI'm just gonna use the file permissions,\nbecause they exist.\n\n281\n00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.740\nAnd so it was going to do that for\nme if I'd go on the easy route.\n\n282\n00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.448\nBut I showed you guys the harder route to\nmake sure that I could show you exactly\n\n283\n00:13:40.448 --> 00:13:41.124\nwhat was going on.\n\n284\n00:13:41.124 --> 00:13:43.980\nIn production environments,\nwhen I go in here and\n\n285\n00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.024\nI set up shared folders like these.\n\n286\n00:13:46.024 --> 00:13:51.666\nI'll just run right down the list and\nI will go into the sharing.\n\n287\n00:13:51.666 --> 00:13:54.700\nI'll go into advanced sharing,\nI'll share it out.\n\n288\n00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.270\nAnd I'll give everyone full control.\n\n289\n00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.660\nAnd I'll do that for\nevery folder that I share out.\n\n290\n00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.270\nAnd it sounds really bad.\n\n291\n00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.880\nIt sounds like,\nhey I'm giving permissions out like\n\n292\n00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:10.320\ncrazy in giving people way more access,\neveryone full control, that's nuts.\n\n293\n00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:17.710\nBut then in the file itself, I'll come in\nand I'll pull the properties back up and\n\n294\n00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.320\ngo to the Security tab, and\nI'll set the permissions here.\n\n295\n00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.740\nTwo reasons for that, right?\n\n296\n00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.390\nOne is the troubleshooting\nwe've already talked about.\n\n297\n00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:26.920\nIf I ever have a problem with permissions,\n\n298\n00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.310\nI have one place to go,\nthe file permissions.\n\n299\n00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.760\nI don't have to worry about the share\npermissions cuz they're wide open and\n\n300\n00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:32.360\nthat's that, right?\n\n301\n00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.920\nSo I don't have to worry there,\nthat makes it easy.\n\n302\n00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.470\nThe second thing is we have to remember\nwhere these permissions are applied.\n\n303\n00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:46.300\nShare permissions are only applied when\nsomebody comes in via the network.\n\n304\n00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:51.420\nThey're not applied when somebody sits\ndown and logs in locally on the machine.\n\n305\n00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:55.650\nSo if I have a server that I\ndon't have physical security on,\n\n306\n00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.310\nan employee can walk up to that server and\nlogin.\n\n307\n00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.490\nAnd all the shared permissions\ndon't apply anymore.\n\n308\n00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:01.760\nThen I go in the network.\n\n309\n00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.810\nThey're local, and\nI know what you're saying,\n\n310\n00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.670\nmaybe I've got the server\nlocked away in a closet.\n\n311\n00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.770\nWell you might have VMC or\nRemote Desktop, SSH.\n\n312\n00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:14.450\nAny kind of remote shell or\nremote console software\n\n313\n00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.600\nwhere they're able to connect to\nthe server and run actions locally.\n\n314\n00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.900\nEven scripts that they can run locally.\n\n315\n00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.600\nIf they can get a script to run locally\n\n316\n00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.450\nthe shared permissions\ndon't apply anymore.\n\n317\n00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:24.790\nSo, if I had done the opposite.\n\n318\n00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.650\nIf I said, on the file system,\nI'll set it to everybody full control and\n\n319\n00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.530\nthen in the share, I'll restrict things.\n\n320\n00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.580\nIf somebody can find a way to access\nfiles with out going over the network,\n\n321\n00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.920\nthey would now have full control.\n\n322\n00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.610\nThat's why that's not a good solution.\n\n323\n00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.540\nInstead, we do the share permissions.\n\n324\n00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.150\nWe make them wide open and off they go.\n\n325\n00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.330\nAll right, so that's kind of a run\ndown on how a lot of these work.\n\n326\n00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:52.389\nAs far as permissions are concerned\nwe saw read, write, modify,\n\n327\n00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:54.845\nexecute, delete is another one.\n\n328\n00:15:54.845 --> 00:15:57.630\nI talked about full control and\nsuper user type access and\n\n329\n00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:59.148\nfile over share permissions.\n\n330\n00:15:59.148 --> 00:16:03.408\nThere are a few other things like\ndenies That we didn't talk about,\n\n331\n00:16:03.408 --> 00:16:06.420\na user might be in more than one group.\n\n332\n00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.110\nSo maybe I'm in HR and IT.\n\n333\n00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:14.170\nAnd if HR gets write access, and\nIT gets read access, what do I get?\n\n334\n00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.710\nI'm in both, right?\n\n335\n00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:21.094\nWell when you're in both, you usually\nget the best of what is available.\n\n336\n00:16:21.094 --> 00:16:24.887\nSo if I'm in HR and I get write access,\nand I'm in IT and I only get read,\n\n337\n00:16:24.887 --> 00:16:26.808\nI'll get the write access from HR.\n\n338\n00:16:26.808 --> 00:16:29.940\nThey combine together at the same level.\n\n339\n00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.510\nThat's where it gets confusing, is if you\nget different things at the share level\n\n340\n00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.050\nand different things at the file level,\nit starts to become a mess.\n\n341\n00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:38.945\nBut at the same level, all within\nthe file system or all within the share,\n\n342\n00:16:38.945 --> 00:16:41.550\nthe permissions combine and\nyou'll get the best of what's available.\n\n343\n00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.940\nThe other thing is that the permissions\nI've shown you here have really all\n\n344\n00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.790\nbeen file and folder, right?\n\n345\n00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.840\nPermissions are different when\nwe have things like printers.\n\n346\n00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.280\nSo if I have a printer set up, which I\ndon't think I have one on this server,\n\n347\n00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.670\nbut if you set up a printer, well I guess\nwe've got a little fake XPS writer,\n\n348\n00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.640\nI can use that one.\n\n349\n00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.680\nSo if you have a printer set up,\nthey have permissions too.\n\n350\n00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:08.170\nAnd you can go into your printer\nproperties, and you can go into Security.\n\n351\n00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.693\nAnd you can define who has what access,\nright?\n\n352\n00:17:09.693 --> 00:17:12.080\nIt looks just like files and folders.\n\n353\n00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.540\nBut look at the permissions down here.\n\n354\n00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.130\nIt's not read, write, full control.\n\n355\n00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:20.610\nIt's print, manage the printer,\nmanage documents, and special permissions.\n\n356\n00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:22.202\nPrint, am I allowed to print?\n\n357\n00:17:22.202 --> 00:17:25.538\nThat's kind of your key thing,\nthat's your typical use of a printer.\n\n358\n00:17:25.538 --> 00:17:32.560\nManage the printer, can I pause\nthe printer, or can I unpause it?\n\n359\n00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.760\nCan I view the queue and\nsee who's printing what?\n\n360\n00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.740\nManage documents, can I get in there and\n\n361\n00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:44.070\nactually stop somebody from printing or\nprioritize my printer?\n\n362\n00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.290\nCan I change what's going on there?\n\n363\n00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.553\nI've got that functionality if I\nhave that manage documents, right?\n\n364\n00:17:48.553 --> 00:17:51.100\nSo this kind of would be what you'd\ngive an administrator, right?\n\n365\n00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.015\nSo, it's different types of permissions\nbecause of the different resource, right?\n\n366\n00:17:55.015 --> 00:17:58.260\nIt's a different type of\nthing that we're controlling.\n\n367\n00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.890\nThat's even more so\ntrue when you look at a network adapter.\n\n368\n00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.897\nMost operating systems have some\nkind of firewall in place, and\n\n369\n00:18:05.897 --> 00:18:08.653\na firewall maintains access control list.\n\n370\n00:18:08.653 --> 00:18:11.381\nIt's a logical access control list,\na logical ACL,\n\n371\n00:18:11.381 --> 00:18:15.250\nwhere you define what network\ncommunications are allowed through.\n\n372\n00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:19.670\nSo for example, in Linux,\nI might have iptables, or\n\n373\n00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:23.990\nI might have FirewallD is another one.\n\n374\n00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.904\nIn Windows, you have the Windows Firewall.\n\n375\n00:18:26.904 --> 00:18:32.855\nAnd if I launch the Windows Firewall, I\ncan see inbound rules and outbound rules.\n\n376\n00:18:32.855 --> 00:18:36.370\nWhat traffic is allowed to\ncome into the server and\n\n377\n00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.430\nwhat traffic's allowed\nto go out of the server.\n\n378\n00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.400\nAnd we don't normally restrict\noutbound traffic, but\n\n379\n00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.690\nthere are times where you need that.\n\n380\n00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:43.395\nWe're normally focused on inbound.\n\n381\n00:18:43.395 --> 00:18:47.927\nIf this is a web server,\nI might only want people to be able to\n\n382\n00:18:47.927 --> 00:18:52.295\nconnect to my server on TCP port 80 and\nTCP port 443.\n\n383\n00:18:52.295 --> 00:18:55.530\nCuz that's what HTTP and HTTPS use, right?\n\n384\n00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.490\nBut if I'm a file server,\n\n385\n00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:02.140\nFTP server, I need to tell 20 and\n21, different needs, right?\n\n386\n00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.090\nAnd we can restrict\nwhat's allowed to access.\n\n387\n00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:09.390\nNow, at the network level, things\nare a little different than at the file or\n\n388\n00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:10.530\nprinter or whatever.\n\n389\n00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.360\nI started mentioning ports and\nIP addresses.\n\n390\n00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.500\nSo if I create a rule,\nI'm gonna create a new rule here.\n\n391\n00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:19.920\nI can allow a program,\n\n392\n00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.550\nsome particular program that launches\nthat has various ports its uses.\n\n393\n00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.060\nI can do specific ports, or\n\n394\n00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.780\nI could do custom rules based\non any number of things.\n\n395\n00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.190\nLet's just kind of run\nthrough a custom rule, so\n\n396\n00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.550\nI can show you some of\nthe options that are out there.\n\n397\n00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:36.570\nYou can base it on a program, and this\nsays, hey, if I launched a program and\n\n398\n00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.690\nthe program is using five different ports,\n\n399\n00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:41.120\nI'll allow connections on\nthose five different ports.\n\n400\n00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.040\nThat's useful if you don't\nunderstand your software.\n\n401\n00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.810\nRead that as,\n\n402\n00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.560\nI never use this option because you\nshould always understand your software.\n\n403\n00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.360\nYou should know what your software's\nexpecting connections to be on.\n\n404\n00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.850\nIf you just say I'll let the program\ndo it, what you're doing is saying,\n\n405\n00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:57.270\nI sure hope the developer of\nthe software knows better than me and\n\n406\n00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.690\nthat they're not opening ports\nthat aren't needed and so on.\n\n407\n00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.430\nAnd the truth is,\n\n408\n00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.610\nthe developers are opening ports\nthat aren't needed, they do that.\n\n409\n00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.930\nThey do whatever it takes to\nmake their software function\n\n410\n00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.010\nunder the assumption that\nyou're gonna secure it.\n\n411\n00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.677\nSo if you make the assumption that they're\ngonna secure it, you've both assumed.\n\n412\n00:20:13.677 --> 00:20:17.363\nAnd you know what happens when you assume,\nyou end up getting hit.\n\n413\n00:20:17.363 --> 00:20:21.103\n[LAUGH] So anyhow, we don't wanna do that,\nso this is an option, but\n\n414\n00:20:21.103 --> 00:20:22.940\nI'm not gonna use it.\n\n415\n00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.830\nProtocols and ports, though,\nI am gonna use that.\n\n416\n00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:31.586\nIf I know I'm bringing up a mail server,\nand it needs SMTP port 25,\n\n417\n00:20:31.586 --> 00:20:38.260\nTCP port 25 for SMTP, if I need TCP\nport 110 for POP3, or 143 for IMAP.\n\n418\n00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.950\nIf I need UDP port 69 for TFTP or\n\n419\n00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:45.990\nsomething like that, I need to understand\nthe protocols that software needs.\n\n420\n00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:50.810\nAnd I can come in, and I can punch them\nin based on what type of protocol it was.\n\n421\n00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:55.947\nUsually we're doing IPv4 or TCP and UDP.\n\n422\n00:20:55.947 --> 00:20:57.440\nYou can come through and specify those.\n\n423\n00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.230\nAnd then the actual ports, if you're gonna\ndo them, All Ports is the default, but\n\n424\n00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:03.690\nwe can go Specific Ports if we want.\n\n425\n00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:06.300\nAnd I can say, hey,\nthis is gonna be a mail server, right?\n\n426\n00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:11.788\nSo it needs TCP port 25 and\nport 110 and 143,\n\n427\n00:21:11.788 --> 00:21:16.902\nmaybe I wanna be able to\nremote into this server,\n\n428\n00:21:16.902 --> 00:21:21.414\nso I allow 3389 for RDP or 22 for SSH.\n\n429\n00:21:21.414 --> 00:21:24.520\nYou start adding in those ports, okay?\n\n430\n00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.390\nNow when I do this,\n\n431\n00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.520\nI'm specifying the port that they're gonna\nbe connecting onto when they get to here.\n\n432\n00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.630\nI can specify the remote port,\nthe port they're using.\n\n433\n00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.470\nBut the remote port is\nnormally randomly generated.\n\n434\n00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.270\nSo I don't know what that is, and\nso we don't normally specify that.\n\n435\n00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:41.760\nBut the destination, I can be very\nspecific about what I'm allowing.\n\n436\n00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.530\nThen I can restrict it to IPs.\n\n437\n00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.290\nMaybe this is an email server for\ninternal clients.\n\n438\n00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.772\nI don't want just anybody on\nthe Internet connecting in.\n\n439\n00:21:51.772 --> 00:21:57.820\nSo, I can say, just these IP addresses,\nand I can specify who that's gonna be.\n\n440\n00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.410\nFor us,\nwe use the 10.0.0.0 network here as a /16.\n\n441\n00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:05.300\nSo, I can punch that in, and\nnow that's being approved.\n\n442\n00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:11.110\nOr if I had an admin station, maybe at\nhome, I have a static IP on my house.\n\n443\n00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.950\nAnd I wanna allow my\n\n444\n00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.380\nhouse to be able to connect to this in\ncase I need to troubleshoot from home.\n\n445\n00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.558\nSo I might come in and\nadd whatever my home is, right?\n\n446\n00:22:18.558 --> 00:22:22.790\nSo I can punch in a single IP address and\nget that added to the list.\n\n447\n00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:27.110\nEntire networks or individual IPs,\nbut I'm picking and choosing.\n\n448\n00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:31.190\nAnd I'm saying, you can only connect\nto the server if you're coming from\n\n449\n00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:33.670\nthis particular IP range.\n\n450\n00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:35.460\nAll right, that's my access control.\n\n451\n00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:40.160\nI'm creating an entry that restricts that.\n\n452\n00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.250\nShoot, and I did it in the wrong place.\n\n453\n00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.275\nI should have done it down here.\n\n454\n00:22:42.275 --> 00:22:45.360\nI did it under the local IP of the server,\nI should have done the remote.\n\n455\n00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.248\nSo we gotta pay attention to that,\nright, these rules are directional.\n\n456\n00:22:49.248 --> 00:22:50.820\nThey have a source and a destination.\n\n457\n00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.680\nThe destination is this server, and\n\n458\n00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.020\nthat would be the local\nIPs that I just specified.\n\n459\n00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.520\nSo let me put this in the right way.\n\n460\n00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.580\nOtherwise, we just have a bad rule.\n\n461\n00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.570\nIf you put the rule in backwards,\ntypically it just doesn't work.\n\n462\n00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:04.240\nAnd now you're allowing\n\n463\n00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.880\ncommunications into your server\nthat you don't actually expect.\n\n464\n00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.764\nSo you've always gotta make sure you take\nthe time to get the rule correct and\n\n465\n00:23:12.764 --> 00:23:15.640\nhave all that set, all right.\n\n466\n00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.010\nThen I can specify my action,\nwhat do I do?\n\n467\n00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:19.130\nDo I allow them?\n\n468\n00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:20.280\nDo I block them?\n\n469\n00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.160\nOr do I only allow them if\nthe connection is secure?\n\n470\n00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.880\nIn this case, it's talking about IP sec.\n\n471\n00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.410\nDo I wanna make sure that\nthey're doing an encrypted IP\n\n472\n00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:30.130\nsec connection with us before\nI allow this connection in?\n\n473\n00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:31.570\nAnd if they're not, do I block it?\n\n474\n00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.259\nBecause there might be\nprotocols like POP3.\n\n475\n00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.913\nPOP3 is not encrypted.\n\n476\n00:23:35.913 --> 00:23:40.686\nWhen it's running on port 110,\nit's unencrypted, and maybe we use POPS,\n\n477\n00:23:40.686 --> 00:23:44.340\nwhere you're stuck on SSL,\nright, or TLS on top of it.\n\n478\n00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.932\nBut it's not widely supported.\n\n479\n00:23:45.932 --> 00:23:48.439\nIt's kind of a clog that's just\nbeen added after the fact, so\n\n480\n00:23:48.439 --> 00:23:51.400\nmaybe I say, you know what,\nwe're gonna run regular POP unencrypted.\n\n481\n00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.790\nBut we're gonna use IP sec to secure it,\nand\n\n482\n00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:59.560\nif the IP sec tunnel is up,\nI'll allow you to connect via POP.\n\n483\n00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.074\nBut if the IPsec tunnel is down,\nI won't allow you to connect,\n\n484\n00:24:02.074 --> 00:24:04.310\ncuz I'm not gonna allow you\nto send email unencrypted.\n\n485\n00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:07.070\nIt's a great way to secure protocols\nthat don't necessarily have encryption\n\n486\n00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.690\nbuilt into them.\n\n487\n00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.340\nIPsec is wonderful for that.\n\n488\n00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.580\nI'm gonna leave mine be, though.\n\n489\n00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:15.810\nAnd then, we can specify in\nWindows they have those domains in\n\n490\n00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:20.280\nlike Red Hat you have zones where you\nspecify different network adapters or\n\n491\n00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.310\nin different networks that may\nhave different security profiles.\n\n492\n00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.008\nSo here we have Domain,\nPrivate and Public.\n\n493\n00:24:27.008 --> 00:24:31.070\nIn Red Hat, you have pretty much the same\nbut you can create even more if you want\n\n494\n00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.790\nand dictate when you're allowing\nthis on which interface.\n\n495\n00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:35.790\nIf I have a multi-home server,\n\n496\n00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:39.010\nI might want to allow pop\nconnections on my LAN interface.\n\n497\n00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.560\nBut not on my WAN interface.\n\n498\n00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.120\nAnd so, we can specify that here.\n\n499\n00:24:43.324 --> 00:24:44.650\nAnd I can finish that up.\n\n500\n00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:48.940\nThis will be my Mail Server Rule or\nwhatever it is you wanna call it.\n\n501\n00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:53.550\nNow, what I'm looking at\nhere is my Mail Server Rule,\n\n502\n00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:58.590\nwhich is one access control entry, an ACE.\n\n503\n00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:02.980\nIn my access control list,\nthis huge list of all these\n\n504\n00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:08.350\ndifferent things that I'm allowing\nthrough my server or blocking.\n\n505\n00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:11.326\nMost of these are allowing, the gray ones\nare rules that are actually turned off.\n\n506\n00:25:11.326 --> 00:25:13.530\nAnd then, I didn't see any red circles.\n\n507\n00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:15.690\nA red would be something\nwe're specifically blocking.\n\n508\n00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:19.440\nSo we can come through and punch these in\nand we're securing our network access.\n\n509\n00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.550\nNot a file, not a folder,\n\n510\n00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:24.170\nnot a printer, but network access\nwith this access control list.\n\n511\n00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:26.950\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, I got another acronym\nfloating around in my head here.\n\n512\n00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:29.940\nAnd I'm gonna say RBAC, R-B-A-C, and\nyou're gonna say, well, wait Wes,\n\n513\n00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.820\nin the first part part of this,\nweren't you there?\n\n514\n00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.080\nI thought I explained what\nRole Based Access Control is.\n\n515\n00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.390\nBut fortunately we've got an acronym\nthat has more than one meaning.\n\n516\n00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:41.143\nIs this an example of\nRule Based Access Control?\n\n517\n00:25:41.143 --> 00:25:42.631\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, technically, it is.\n\n518\n00:25:42.631 --> 00:25:46.430\nYes, because we're defining a rule.\n\n519\n00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:50.350\nA rule that states various\ncriteria that have to be met.\n\n520\n00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.930\nThere is a way we can configure this where\nI don't use some of the advanced features,\n\n521\n00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.510\nwhere it's not truly a rule anymore.\n\n522\n00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.140\nWhere it is really just\na particular match, and that's it.\n\n523\n00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.110\nBut if we use the various options and\nwe use it the way I just did it, and\n\n524\n00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.290\nthen yes, it is a rule.\n\n525\n00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:08.700\nSo we're creating a rule-based\naccess control list, and it's done.\n\n526\n00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:14.694\nThe big differentiator when we deal\nwith a typical ACLs or role-based access\n\n527\n00:26:14.694 --> 00:26:19.950\ncontrol and rule-based, is that\nrule-based, the entire list applies.\n\n528\n00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.710\nWith role based, you kinda pick and\nchoose through the roles and\n\n529\n00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:25.490\ncombine them to create the best.\n\n530\n00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.792\nYou don't create the best with rule-based.\n\n531\n00:26:27.792 --> 00:26:31.970\nWith rule-based, you start at the top and\nyou work your way down to the bottom.\n\n532\n00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:36.290\nSo when a connection comes in to my\nserver, it looks at rule number one.\n\n533\n00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.970\nAnd if rule number one matches,\nit does whatever rule number one says, and\n\n534\n00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:42.660\nthen it stops.\n\n535\n00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.750\nBut if rule number one doesn't match, it\ngoes to rule two, and then rule three, and\n\n536\n00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.260\nthen rule four, and five, and\n\n537\n00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:52.380\ncontinues down the list hitting each of\nthe other ones until it hits a match.\n\n538\n00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.490\nThe first match it finds is\nthe one that takes effect.\n\n539\n00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:56.450\nAnd I gotta be careful with that,\n\n540\n00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:00.580\nbecause if I put a rule in here,\nthat is a block rule.\n\n541\n00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.544\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\nI'm gonna block a port and\n\n542\n00:27:04.544 --> 00:27:06.707\nit's gonna be TCP Port 25.\n\n543\n00:27:06.707 --> 00:27:09.520\nAnd I'm gonna tell it to\nblock the connection.\n\n544\n00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.860\nSo I've just defined that, Block SMTP.\n\n545\n00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:16.492\nNow, I've got a rule here\nthat says Block SMTP, and\n\n546\n00:27:16.492 --> 00:27:21.142\nright after it I've got\na rule that says allow SMTP.\n\n547\n00:27:21.142 --> 00:27:24.110\nIf you're from these IPs.\n\n548\n00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:30.771\nWell, if it applies from the top down,\nit hits the first rule and blocks SMTP.\n\n549\n00:27:30.771 --> 00:27:34.760\nAnd that's it,\nSMTP is not allowed no matter who you are.\n\n550\n00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.430\nIt's gonna be blocked.\n\n551\n00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:38.670\nIf it didn't match,\nit would go to the second rule.\n\n552\n00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:41.210\nSo if it was POP3, it's coming in on 110,\nit doesn't match the first rule,\n\n553\n00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:42.810\nit goes to the second one.\n\n554\n00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.740\nIt's permitted, and it stops there.\n\n555\n00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:45.660\nAnd it permits the traffic.\n\n556\n00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.550\nIt never gets to anything after.\n\n557\n00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:52.130\nSo with rule-based, we've really got to\npay attention to the order of our entries.\n\n558\n00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:56.150\nWith regular ACLs that are just role\nbased like what we saw in the finals.\n\n559\n00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:57.070\nBut order doesn't matter.\n\n560\n00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:59.690\nI don't care if Wes is first on\nthe list or last on the list.\n\n561\n00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:02.060\nWhen it checks his permission,\nit looks for Wes.\n\n562\n00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.690\nAnd it finds him anywhere on the list.\n\n563\n00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:06.040\nAnd then, it looks for the groups that\nhe's in, and it finds those two and\n\n564\n00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.100\ncombines them all together.\n\n565\n00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:07.970\nAll that magic.\n\n566\n00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:08.720\nThat doesn't happen here.\n\n567\n00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.550\nThese are much more simple.\n\n568\n00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.400\nAnd implied very, very literally.\n\n569\n00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.670\nSo you do have to pay attention to\nthe order these things are in and\n\n570\n00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:19.250\nthat you've created them in\na method that makes sense.\n\n571\n00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.850\nAnd when I talk about the order,\nI'm on a Windows Server,\n\n572\n00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.420\nwhich is a really bad\nplace to show this cuz you\n\n573\n00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.400\ncan change the order sort of\nalphabetically by name and stuff.\n\n574\n00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:31.440\nBut on a CISCO router or on a Juniper\nrouter, we would actually be able to move\n\n575\n00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:35.520\nthe rules up, and\ndown to change that order and apply it.\n\n576\n00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.680\nOn a Windows Server, the best place is\nthat it would be in a policy module which\n\n577\n00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.580\nI don't think I have\ninstalled on this server.\n\n578\n00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.271\nYeah, I don't.\n\n579\n00:28:42.271 --> 00:28:45.760\nI've got a little security too,\nthat's not what I want.\n\n580\n00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:46.880\nBut you can actually go in there and\n\n581\n00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.620\nyou can change like if you\nhave a remote access server,\n\n582\n00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.890\nyou can change the order of the rules.\n\n583\n00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:54.680\nAnd that's why I hesitated to say that\nthis is role-based, is that it can be when\n\n584\n00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:59.090\nit's applied properly but\nthe way it is here, it can also not be.\n\n585\n00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.210\nIt's a bit of a mix.\n\n586\n00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:04.043\nBut that's kinda the difference\nwith role-based access control.\n\n587\n00:29:04.043 --> 00:29:07.490\nI think that pretty much wraps\nup our access control list.\n\n588\n00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:09.620\nKey thing to remember on this is,\n\n589\n00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.640\nwe've gotta be careful to\nkeep these things maintained.\n\n590\n00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.340\nThat you might have it setup perfectly\non day 1 and then on day 500,\n\n591\n00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.590\nthings are just completely holds up.\n\n592\n00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:21.780\nAnd permission has been thrown\nabout it and messed up.\n\n593\n00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.640\nSo you gotta constantly\nmaintain a stand up.\n\n594\n00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.780\nYou got to do audits and\nmake sure everything is in place.\n\n595\n00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:31.420\nThe other thing is you can confuse\nwhat we've done here with some other\n\n596\n00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.890\ntechnologies that are don't\nactually provide security.\n\n597\n00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:37.620\nSo for example, the groups that I've been\ncreating, those are security groups.\n\n598\n00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.770\nSecurity groups are designed for\npermissions.\n\n599\n00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:41.580\nThere's also distribution groups.\n\n600\n00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.770\nAnd I don't think it gave me\nthat option when I made it.\n\n601\n00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:45.420\nLet's see if I even had that option.\n\n602\n00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.840\nWhen you make a group here,\nit's just creating a group.\n\n603\n00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.850\nBut if I was in the Microsoft Active\nDirectory, when you create a group,\n\n604\n00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:53.470\nyou can create a security group or\na distribution group.\n\n605\n00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:54.660\nThey both hold user accounts.\n\n606\n00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.480\nYou put user accounts in.\n\n607\n00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.500\nIt's great.\n\n608\n00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:00.290\nBut a distribution group can't be used for\npermissions.\n\n609\n00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:03.750\nYou can't assign permissions to\none of those, their designed for\n\n610\n00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.388\nemail or things like that.\n\n611\n00:30:05.388 --> 00:30:07.960\nIf I wanna communicate to a group of\npeople, I put them in a distribution\n\n612\n00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.590\ngroup, and I can send an email to that\ngroup and the email goes to all of them.\n\n613\n00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.750\nIs that access control?\n\n614\n00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:15.430\nNo, I sort of.\n\n615\n00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.200\nIt's who's gonna get that email.\n\n616\n00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.070\nBut you can just add somebody to\nthe CC line, and that solves that.\n\n617\n00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:21.450\nAnd then, they get the email.\n\n618\n00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:26.200\nSo distribution groups and groups of\nthat nature, don't provide security.\n\n619\n00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.350\nSecurity groups,\nones that you can assign permissions to.\n\n620\n00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:32.610\nThose are ones that provide security and\ncan be used in access control lists.\n\n621\n00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:34.030\nSo don't get confused on that.\n\n622\n00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:36.168\nIt is easy to mix them up.\n\n623\n00:30:36.168 --> 00:30:39.560\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, well, thank you for\nrounding up our topics here, does look\n\n624\n00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:43.732\nlike we're coming to the end of another\nepisode, but are we truly done here?\n\n625\n00:30:43.732 --> 00:30:46.420\nWe gotta give you a chance, Don,\nyou have any additional words,\n\n626\n00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:50.750\nmaybe you like to give our viewers when\nit comes to logical access control.\n\n627\n00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:54.790\n&gt;&gt; I focus on Windows in these last two\nepisodes because that was on the exam, but\n\n628\n00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:59.090\nin real life you gonna have far more\nservice running Linux than Windows and so\n\n629\n00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:00.720\nmake sure you're familiar with it there.\n\n630\n00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.300\nIn the Unix environment, permissions are\ndone a little bit different because you\n\n631\n00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.980\nhave one user, one group, and\nthen everyone else who has access.\n\n632\n00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:11.230\nSo to manage it because you only have\none group tied to a file folder,\n\n633\n00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.288\nyou're going to have to do nesting.\n\n634\n00:31:13.288 --> 00:31:16.140\nYou gonna have the nest groups together to\nget permission set that the way you want\n\n635\n00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.290\nin the Unix world.\n\n636\n00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:18.170\nSame goes for Mac OS,\n\n637\n00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:20.720\nalthough they do have some extended\npermissions to help with that.\n\n638\n00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.680\nSo pay attention to your operating system,\nunderstand\n\n639\n00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.720\nthat it might be a little different, but\nthe fundamentals in theory, identical.\n\n640\n00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:31.630\nIt's the same rule that you wanna make\nsure you do the principle of least\n\n641\n00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:35.450\nprivilege, give people as minimum access\nas they need to get their job done, and\n\n642\n00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:37.880\nmake sure that you maintain and\ndocument it.\n\n643\n00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.460\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, it's been\na pleasure having you in the studios.\n\n644\n00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.590\nAnd it's been a pleasure having\nyou the viewer watching.\n\n645\n00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:45.610\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n646\n00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:46.290\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n647\n00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:47.567\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n648\n00:31:47.567 --> 00:31:54.812\n[MUSIC]\n\n649\n00:31:54.812 -->

00:00:13.124\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\n\n4\n00:00:13.124 --> 00:00:14.403\nepisode here at IT ProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.403 --> 00:00:17.895\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and in today's\nepisode, what do we got for you?\n\n6\n00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:20.495\nWell more of that Comp TS Server\nplus S Gate 004 and\n\n7\n00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:23.595\njoining us in the studios is Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:24.625\nDon how you doing sir?\n\n9\n00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:25.615\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:25.615 --> 00:00:29.673\nReady to talk about the environment that's\nright we're gonna save some trees today,\n\n11\n00:00:29.673 --> 00:00:30.737\nwell no, not really.\n\n12\n00:00:30.737 --> 00:00:31.881\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're actually gonna talk\n\n13\n00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:34.450\nabout environmental control, which is a\nlittle bit different than the environment.\n\n14\n00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.410\nAlthough, it does come into play.\n\n15\n00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.651\nWe'll talk about that when we\nget to the section on halon.\n\n16\n00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:40.265\nBut we're gonna talk\nabout the environment,\n\n17\n00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:44.689\nthe atmospherics and conditioning that\ngoes on in a data center that are really\n\n18\n00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:47.972\nimportant because if they get\nout of whack, you can well,\n\n19\n00:00:47.972 --> 00:00:51.944\nbest case scenario just have\na shortened lifetime on your equipment.\n\n20\n00:00:51.944 --> 00:00:54.410\nWorst case scenario have\na data center that shuts down,\n\n21\n00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.623\nwhich we don't want to do.\n\n22\n00:00:55.623 --> 00:00:58.003\nSo we're gonna reach in and\ntalk about electricity.\n\n23\n00:00:58.003 --> 00:00:59.489\nWe're gonna talk about air conditioning.\n\n24\n00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.834\nWe're gonna talk about backups and\nredundancy and\n\n25\n00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:07.510\nall the different things that aren't\nserver and technology focused.\n\n26\n00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.460\nIt's not our product, but\nit's stuff that supports our product and\n\n27\n00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.550\nis just as important.\n\n28\n00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.980\nAll right, so let's get this\nthing started with electricity.\n\n29\n00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.565\nI wanna talk about UPS's.\n\n30\n00:01:18.565 --> 00:01:20.952\nUPS's are uninterruptible power supplies,\n\n31\n00:01:20.952 --> 00:01:24.326\nand most of us should be familiar\nwith what a UPS's by this point.\n\n32\n00:01:24.326 --> 00:01:28.116\nAt a minimum, you've seen the desktop\nversion of a UPS, which is far more common\n\n33\n00:01:28.116 --> 00:01:31.096\nout there in the real world,\ncuz there's a lot more desktops.\n\n34\n00:01:31.096 --> 00:01:34.350\nBut in a data center UPS's\nare a lot different.\n\n35\n00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.230\nAnd I wanna make sure that you\nguys have a clear understanding of\n\n36\n00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.730\nwhat a UPS is actually intended to do.\n\n37\n00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.590\nBecause there's some confusion here,\nespecially for\n\n38\n00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.240\nthose of you just getting\nstarted in the server world.\n\n39\n00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.480\nA lot of us think of a UPS as a way for\nus to work while the power is out.\n\n40\n00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.790\nAnd that's not what is intended to do.\n\n41\n00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.780\nFor example,\nat home I might have a computer and\n\n42\n00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.290\nI might have something very, very\nimportant to do like play a video game.\n\n43\n00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.550\nAnd if the power goes out,\nnow I can't play the video game.\n\n44\n00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.090\nBut if I have a UPS hooked up,\nI could take the UPS and\n\n45\n00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.770\nplug it into the wall, and it's usually\njust got a bank of batteries in it.\n\n46\n00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.260\nThey typically have like four\nbatteries inside of them.\n\n47\n00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.170\nAnd those batteries will charge up\nover time, and when the power goes out\n\n48\n00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.740\nanything plugged into that\nbattery is going to stay running.\n\n49\n00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.870\nSo if I have my PC tower and\n\n50\n00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.920\nmy monitor plugged into that ups,\npower goes out, I keep running.\n\n51\n00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.450\nI keep shooting aliens or whatever\nit is I'm doing for half an hour or\n\n52\n00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.200\nmaybe even an hour.\n\n53\n00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.950\nMost power outages are pretty short.\n\n54\n00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.100\nSo power is gonna come back and\n\n55\n00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.150\nthen I continue on uninterrupted\nsaving the universe.\n\n56\n00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.350\nHowever in a data center that's\nnot what a UPS is intended to do.\n\n57\n00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.680\nThe reality of things is that servers\ndraw a lot of power, a ton of power.\n\n58\n00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.390\nAnd just keeping the server\nonline isn't enough.\n\n59\n00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.140\nThe server is gonna be plugged\ninto a switch for networking, so\n\n60\n00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.210\nthat switch has to stay online.\n\n61\n00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.240\nThat server is gonna be plugged into\na storage area network, a SAN, so\n\n62\n00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.530\nthat's got to stay online.\n\n63\n00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.160\nThe server by itself probably\nisn't my entire server.\n\n64\n00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.970\nI probably have tons of servers,\nand they all need to stay online.\n\n65\n00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.780\nAnd to expect a battery to be able\nto do that is pretty unrealistic.\n\n66\n00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.850\nNow you can get some massive battery\nsolutions that are out there.\n\n67\n00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.970\nThere are some solutions that are just\ninsanely crazy that can actually power\n\n68\n00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.830\ndata centers for a long time.\n\n69\n00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.487\nBut what a UPS is really\ndesigned to do in a data center,\n\n70\n00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:40.842\nIs simply to keep your\nservers online long enough so\n\n71\n00:03:40.842 --> 00:03:44.922\nthat your generators can kick in and\ntake over.\n\n72\n00:03:44.922 --> 00:03:48.971\nA power generator creates electricity or\nhave a motor inside of it,\n\n73\n00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:52.959\ntypically a diesel motor that will run and\ngenerate electricity.\n\n74\n00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.948\nAnd it can generate electricity for\n\n75\n00:03:54.948 --> 00:03:59.540\nas long there is diesel fuel which\nmeans we keep adding fuel to it.\n\n76\n00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.010\nA UPS can't do that,\na UPS has a battery in it.\n\n77\n00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.920\nAnd as the battery starts to run down,\ncan we fill it back up?\n\n78\n00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.480\nNo, I mean if power comes back,\nyou can fill it back up.\n\n79\n00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.880\nBut if power comes back,\nyou don't need the UPS anymore.\n\n80\n00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.580\nSo there's no way to refill a UPS.\n\n81\n00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.010\nIt's not a longterm solution.\n\n82\n00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.259\nAnd when I say longterm,\nI'm talking about 15 minutes.\n\n83\n00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:24.890\nThat as a big a UPS as you get,\nservers draw a ton of power.\n\n84\n00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.510\nSwitches draw a ton of power, especially\nif you have POE, power over Ethernet.\n\n85\n00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.820\nNow you're providing even\nmore power over your links.\n\n86\n00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.000\nIt's crazy.\n\n87\n00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.560\nIt's not going to be enough.\n\n88\n00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.490\nBut in the server world,\n\n89\n00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.580\nif I can get 15 minutes out of a UPS,\nthat's a good UPS to me.\n\n90\n00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.760\nIf I can get 5 minutes out of it,\nit's a good UPS to me.\n\n91\n00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.960\nI need to keep my infrastructure\non just long enough,\n\n92\n00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.920\nso that the generators can fire up.\n\n93\n00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.160\nBecause a generator's a motor, and\nthink about your car in the morning,\n\n94\n00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.330\nyou start your car up, right?\n\n95\n00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.520\nYou crank the engine and\nthe car's running.\n\n96\n00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.970\nBut you don't turn your car on and just\nimmediately throw it into drive, right?\n\n97\n00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.040\nYou turn the car on, and\nit's kind of warming up.\n\n98\n00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.520\nIt takes a moment and you're not at\n\n99\n00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.770\nfull performance right when you first\ncrank that engine, it takes a moment.\n\n100\n00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.430\nGenerators are the same way.\n\n101\n00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.960\nYou crank that engine and it starts\ngenerating electricity, it takes a moment\n\n102\n00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.980\nto fill up its buffers and the capacitors\nand things that it uses to store and\n\n103\n00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.610\nthen deploy that energy to you\nin a fairly stable manner.\n\n104\n00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.370\nSo it takes a moment for that to happen.\n\n105\n00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.170\nAnd it could take three to five minutes.\n\n106\n00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.070\nIt could take ten minutes.\n\n107\n00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.480\nIt depends on the generator that you buy.\n\n108\n00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.430\nIt could take a certain period of time.\n\n109\n00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.440\nAnd so when you pick your UPS's,\nthat's what you're really thinking about,\n\n110\n00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.401\nis how much battery power do I need\nto keep my servers running for\n\n111\n00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:43.935\nhowever long it takes my\ngenerators to fire up, right?\n\n112\n00:05:43.935 --> 00:05:47.128\nAnd that's a different way of thinking\nthan desktop UPS's and that's why I wanna\n\n113\n00:05:47.128 --> 00:05:49.588\nstress that so much right here\nin the beginning of the episode.\n\n114\n00:05:49.588 --> 00:05:54.262\n&gt;&gt; Don, is that protecting essentially\nfrom things like a critical power failure,\n\n115\n00:05:54.262 --> 00:05:58.800\nmaybe I have a database server and they're\ndoing writes to a transaction log and\n\n116\n00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.120\nwhere we want that generator to come on.\n\n117\n00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.755\nWe're not trying to,\nobviously stay on for 8 hours or so, but\n\n118\n00:06:03.755 --> 00:06:06.668\nare we protecting from things like\ncritical kernel power failures?\n\n119\n00:06:06.668 --> 00:06:07.584\nis that what we're saying?\n\n120\n00:06:07.584 --> 00:06:11.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI think about to the old days, right.\n\n121\n00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.355\nI had a computer that I bought in 1993 or\n1994 and it ran Windows\n\n122\n00:06:17.355 --> 00:06:23.130\n3.1.And you'd fire up DOS 6.2 and\nWindows 3.1, and you'd use them.\n\n123\n00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.150\nAnd when you were done with the computer,\nyou just pushed the power button and\n\n124\n00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.620\nthe whole thing went off.\n\n125\n00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.250\nOr I had an OS 2 machine\naround the same time,\n\n126\n00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.860\nand when you were done you push\nthe power button and it went off.\n\n127\n00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.450\nWell, starting in Windows 95 and OS 2\nWarp and in some of the newer versions of\n\n128\n00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.640\nthe OS's, they introduced this idea\nof shutting down your computer.\n\n129\n00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.150\nAnd a lot of people didn't understand,\nlike I used to just flip this switch and\n\n130\n00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.060\nthe computer went off.\n\n131\n00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.120\nWhat's up with that?\n\n132\n00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.970\nWell, What happens is your computer\nis constantly performing actions,\n\n133\n00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.910\nconstantly doing things,\nespecially on a server.\n\n134\n00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.020\nServers are always doing stuff, so\nyou have clients that are connected.\n\n135\n00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.310\nNow if it's just a web server and\nit's serving up a static web page and\n\n136\n00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.220\nit doesn't change, and I cut the power to\nit it's actually not that big of a deal.\n\n137\n00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.610\nNothing was going on.\n\n138\n00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.950\nBut if it's a database server like\nWes described, you could have been\n\n139\n00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.190\nwriting data to the database at\nthat moment and you lose power.\n\n140\n00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.320\nWell, okay, so what happens then?\n\n141\n00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.880\nI power the server back on and there's\nhalf of my data written to the database.\n\n142\n00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.010\nWhere is the other half?\n\n143\n00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.910\nWell, it was in RAM, and we lost power.\n\n144\n00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.130\nAnd when you lose power, RAM gets erased.\n\n145\n00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.670\nThat's it, a RAM resets itself\nevery time you lose power.\n\n146\n00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.200\nIt doesn't reset itself, what happens\nis RAM needs a constant charge.\n\n147\n00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.080\nBecause the moment you write a 1 or\na 0 to RAM,\n\n148\n00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.830\nthe electrical impulse that's stored\nto store that 1 or 0 starts to degrade.\n\n149\n00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.530\nIt degrades immediately, and so\nRAM is constantly being refreshed.\n\n150\n00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:52.360\nWhen you write a 1 into a column,\nor row, or whatever into RAM.\n\n151\n00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.192\nYou just don't write it once.\n\n152\n00:07:53.192 --> 00:07:55.875\nYou are constantly rewriting it over and\nover and over again.\n\n153\n00:07:55.875 --> 00:08:00.802\nThat's the megahertz speed of RAM, is how\noften it's having to refresh that number.\n\n154\n00:08:00.802 --> 00:08:03.290\nAnd how quickly it can do it.\n\n155\n00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.581\nSo it's rewriting that.\n\n156\n00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:06.680\nWell, the instant you lose power,\nit's not rewriting that.\n\n157\n00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.986\nAnd that one degrades very, very quickly,\nand with a matter of milliseconds,\n\n158\n00:08:10.986 --> 00:08:12.480\nthe data is gone.\n\n159\n00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.331\nIt's milliseconds, very, very short.\n\n160\n00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:17.026\nSo when you power off your computer,\neverything in RAM is gone, but\n\n161\n00:08:17.026 --> 00:08:19.980\nwhat was written to the hard\ndrive is still there.\n\n162\n00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.698\nOnly it's half of what you've written.\n\n163\n00:08:22.698 --> 00:08:25.890\nSo when you powered the system back on,\nit goes to load the databases.\n\n164\n00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.059\nOnly half the data there,\nthat's corruption.\n\n165\n00:08:28.059 --> 00:08:31.150\nNow, we have a corrupt file,\ndatabase doesn't mount.\n\n166\n00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.497\nNow a lot of databases have protection for\nthat.\n\n167\n00:08:32.497 --> 00:08:33.972\nWes mentioned transaction logs, right.\n\n168\n00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:38.435\nTransaction logs are a technology used\nin databases to protect from that exact\n\n169\n00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:39.610\nscenario.\n\n170\n00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:40.870\nBut not everything has that.\n\n171\n00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.162\nIf I was working on a Microsoft Word\ndocument and I was halfway through\n\n172\n00:08:44.162 --> 00:08:47.860\na write and I shut it down,\nWord doesn't use transaction logs.\n\n173\n00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.490\nAnd so I'm gonna have a corrupt file.\n\n174\n00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:55.160\nSo we need to gracefully shut\ndown our system on a UPS.\n\n175\n00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.254\nIf you have a UPS without a generator,\n\n176\n00:08:57.254 --> 00:09:01.520\nthen the purpose of a UPS at that point\nIs to allow you to gracefully shut down.\n\n177\n00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.160\nSo you have two different kinds of UPSs.\n\n178\n00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.917\nYou have regular UPSs and\nsmart UPSs, all right.\n\n179\n00:09:06.917 --> 00:09:10.896\nA smart UPS is one that will have a USB or\nserial port on the back of it, or\n\n180\n00:09:10.896 --> 00:09:14.620\npotentially a network jack,\nthat will let it connect to your PC.\n\n181\n00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.981\nAnd it will communicate over that line.\n\n182\n00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:20.949\nSo when the power goes out,\nthe UPS can tell the PC hey,\n\n183\n00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:24.330\npower's out, but I'm at 100% charged.\n\n184\n00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.957\nSo you've got 20 minutes remaining.\n\n185\n00:09:25.957 --> 00:09:29.633\nAnd then as the battery runs down,\nyou get to ten minutes remaining, and\n\n186\n00:09:29.633 --> 00:09:33.491\nfive minutes remaining, and at a certain\nthreshold it tells the computer,\n\n187\n00:09:33.491 --> 00:09:37.000\nhey I'm running out of battery\nyou need to gracefully shut down.\n\n188\n00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.102\nAnd now, the computer can\ngracefully shut down, save.\n\n189\n00:09:39.102 --> 00:09:43.026\nIt’s not gonna stop writing to\nthe disk and close down properly.\n\n190\n00:09:43.026 --> 00:09:43.770\nThat’s what we want.\n\n191\n00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.023\nNow, the example I just gave\nyou was in a desktop world.\n\n192\n00:09:47.023 --> 00:09:49.451\nDesktop UPSs,\nthey'll have a little serial port or\n\n193\n00:09:49.451 --> 00:09:51.500\nwhatever, plug right into your computer.\n\n194\n00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.390\nBut what if I have 1,000 servers?\n\n195\n00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:56.370\nAm I gonna buy 1,000 UPSs?\n\n196\n00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.952\nNo, am I gonna get one giant UPS\nwith just 1,000 serial cables?\n\n197\n00:09:59.952 --> 00:10:04.830\nNo, commercial data center\nUPSs will use network.\n\n198\n00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.180\nThey'll have network connectivity on them\nso they can plug right into your switch.\n\n199\n00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.260\nThey'll need to keep the switch online,\ntoo, during this whole process.\n\n200\n00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.390\nAnd you'll run a little software\nagent on each of your servers.\n\n201\n00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.035\nThey have Linux agents,\nWindows agents, whatever.\n\n202\n00:10:18.035 --> 00:10:20.170\nAnd that way, they can just\ncommunicate over the network.\n\n203\n00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.444\nThey can send out one broadcast\nmessage to all the servers,\n\n204\n00:10:23.444 --> 00:10:25.810\nsaying hey we're now on battery just fyi.\n\n205\n00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:30.585\nAnd then, as power starts to go down,\nwe can have rules defined that say\n\n206\n00:10:30.585 --> 00:10:35.280\nhere's the critical servers,\nkeep them up till the last moment.\n\n207\n00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:35.880\nBut here's non critical servers.\n\n208\n00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.600\nGo ahead and\ngracefully shut them down right away.\n\n209\n00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.109\nAnd it can gracefully shut them down and\n\n210\n00:10:40.109 --> 00:10:41.900\nextend that timeout as far as you can,\nright?\n\n211\n00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.351\nThat's what the commercial\ngrade UPS's are.\n\n212\n00:10:44.351 --> 00:10:47.194\nNow, many of you probably haven't\nseen commercial grade UPS's, so\n\n213\n00:10:47.194 --> 00:10:48.651\nI brought a few up here on my laptop.\n\n214\n00:10:48.651 --> 00:10:51.455\nLet me show you some from APC and III.\n\n215\n00:10:51.455 --> 00:10:55.463\nThere’s several different vendors that\nare out there that manufacture these.\n\n216\n00:10:55.463 --> 00:10:58.508\nAnd I just wanna kinda\nshow you some examples so\n\n217\n00:10:58.508 --> 00:11:02.210\nyou understand the size\nthat I'm talking about.\n\n218\n00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:07.025\nBehind me are server racks, and the server\nracks behind me are 42 U in height.\n\n219\n00:11:07.025 --> 00:11:11.070\nThese UPSs are 42 U in height, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.040\nThese are full size rack UPSs.\n\n221\n00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.483\nAnd they're designed to provide\ntons of power for systems and\n\n222\n00:11:18.483 --> 00:11:24.230\nthese are like desktop UPS that you plug\ninto a regular 120 volt wall socket.\n\n223\n00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.889\nNotice these are 3 Phase UPS\npower protections systems.\n\n224\n00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:33.850\nMost of these are gonna be 208 volt or\nI'm sorry, 208 watt?\n\n225\n00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:34.575\nWait, volt, I was right.\n\n226\n00:11:34.575 --> 00:11:37.056\n[INAUDIBLE] doubt myself here.\n\n227\n00:11:37.056 --> 00:11:40.300\n208 volt,\nwhich means they're taking 3 phase power.\n\n228\n00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.412\nAnd they take 3 phase power\nbecause we can then take that and\n\n229\n00:11:43.412 --> 00:11:47.643\nsplit that out into multiple 120 volt or\n240 or whatever it is that we need to\n\n230\n00:11:47.643 --> 00:11:50.777\nprovide that to the clients and\ngive them the power we need.\n\n231\n00:11:50.777 --> 00:11:54.170\nSo, here they show the smaller version,\nwhich is one rack.\n\n232\n00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.850\nOr we get to larger with two or\neven larger here.\n\n233\n00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.414\nIt's kind of hard to see all the fans that\nare kind of tucked away in this because\n\n234\n00:12:01.414 --> 00:12:03.520\nbatteries, when they charge, they get hot.\n\n235\n00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.800\nSo you got to push that heat out.\n\n236\n00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.390\nSo there's a lot to them.\n\n237\n00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.573\nThere's a little LCD screen\non the front of this one so\n\n238\n00:12:10.573 --> 00:12:13.640\nyou can monitor its health and\nperformance.\n\n239\n00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.970\nBut this is the type of solution that\nI'm talking about in a data center.\n\n240\n00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.960\nThese things that are massive.\n\n241\n00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.530\n&gt;&gt; And Don, it really doesn't matter\nif I'm understanding this right.\n\n242\n00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.380\nIt doesn't matter the size of the UPS.\n\n243\n00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.523\nThe principle still stays the same.\n\n244\n00:12:23.523 --> 00:12:27.062\nI can have a UPS that's the size of\na truck and when it comes down to it,\n\n245\n00:12:27.062 --> 00:12:30.557\nit's still only there right,\nto provide that graceful shutdown.\n\n246\n00:12:30.557 --> 00:12:32.300\nIt doesn't matter what size it is.\n\n247\n00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.853\nThat's exactly right, yep.\n\n248\n00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:38.065\nAnd there's other solutions where instead\nof leveraging technology like this,\n\n249\n00:12:38.065 --> 00:12:41.990\nthey use a controller, and then they\nuse the big 12-volt car batteries.\n\n250\n00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:45.426\nAnd you can chain, you can daisy\nchain 100 of those car batteries and\n\n251\n00:12:45.426 --> 00:12:47.270\nactually get the same kind of result.\n\n252\n00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.689\nThe batteries don't last as long, but\n\n253\n00:12:48.689 --> 00:12:52.145\nthe maintenance is a little bit cheaper\ncuz they're just traditional batteries.\n\n254\n00:12:52.145 --> 00:12:54.482\nBut at the end of the day,\nyou're not gonna run for\n\n255\n00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:56.380\na huge period of time on that equipment.\n\n256\n00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:01.070\nIt's just buying you a little bit of time\nso yo can put a contingency in place.\n\n257\n00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.508\n&gt;&gt; Don, you mention batteries,\nwow, 12 volt car batteries,\n\n258\n00:13:03.508 --> 00:13:04.711\nthat's pretty insane there.\n\n259\n00:13:04.711 --> 00:13:08.622\nNow, speaking of batteries, I know that\nI've left a laptop plugged in for, well,\n\n260\n00:13:08.622 --> 00:13:12.113\nI probably shouldn't admit this on camera,\nbut six months or so, right?\n\n261\n00:13:12.113 --> 00:13:16.304\nAnd when they look fine with the laptop,\nat the moment I unplugged it though,\n\n262\n00:13:16.304 --> 00:13:17.090\nit shut down.\n\n263\n00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.378\nThe power's shut down.\nAnd it was only then that I realized\n\n264\n00:13:19.378 --> 00:13:21.977\nthe battery, it was toast, it was trash.\n\n265\n00:13:21.977 --> 00:13:26.504\nIf we're always on battery power, there's\ngotta be some kinda similarity that could\n\n266\n00:13:26.504 --> 00:13:28.810\nhappen I could only\nimagine inside of a UPS.\n\n267\n00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.641\nAnd are there ways,\nif it does happen, to prevent that?\n\n268\n00:13:30.641 --> 00:13:33.655\nAll right, so there's a few different\nthings that happen inside of the UPS.\n\n269\n00:13:33.655 --> 00:13:36.390\nAnd what Wes is really talking\nabout is battery lifetime.\n\n270\n00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.140\nBatteries don't last forever.\n\n271\n00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.662\nWell, these UPS's\nare incredibly expensive, and\n\n272\n00:13:40.662 --> 00:13:44.280\nthey've got some of the best logics\nbuilt inside of them possible.\n\n273\n00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.876\nSo, when you take a look at\nsomething like a laptop, and\n\n274\n00:13:46.876 --> 00:13:50.810\nyou plug it into a wall socket, it's got\na battery and it's charging that battery.\n\n275\n00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:54.331\nBut when you plug into the wall,\nit actually stops using the battery and\n\n276\n00:13:54.331 --> 00:13:56.600\nit starts using the wall directly.\n\n277\n00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.865\nAnd that means that the battery\nsits there and charges and\n\n278\n00:13:58.865 --> 00:14:01.190\nit just charges constantly,\ncharge, charge, charge.\n\n279\n00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.509\nBut on these UPSs what they'll\ndo is they'll cycle so\n\n280\n00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:09.085\nthat you're always running from\nthe battery even if you're plugged into\n\n281\n00:14:09.085 --> 00:14:11.320\nthe wall which a UPS would be.\n\n282\n00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.696\nThe UPS is charging the batteries, but\nyou're always running from the battery.\n\n283\n00:14:13.696 --> 00:14:15.280\nThey're always getting used.\n\n284\n00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.000\nAnd that means they don't develop\na memory, like you would on a cell phone.\n\n285\n00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.070\nYou're not running them down\nto zero every single day.\n\n286\n00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.730\nThe batteries are usually staying at 100%.\n\n287\n00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:26.535\nBut they're cycling through internally\nbetween the different batteries to\n\n288\n00:14:26.535 --> 00:14:29.010\nkeep them healthy and keep them running.\n\n289\n00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.129\nBut no matter what you do,\nthey have a lifetime and\n\n290\n00:14:31.129 --> 00:14:33.160\nthat lifetime is typically\ntwo to three years.\n\n291\n00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.410\nAnd so,\nwhen you have a UPS solution like this,\n\n292\n00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:37.560\nyou've got to have a maintenance schedule.\n\n293\n00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.850\nAnd it's going to vary\nbased on the vendor.\n\n294\n00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:42.190\nYou've got to talk to the vendor,\nread the documentation.\n\n295\n00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.100\nThey usually have training\nprograms you go through.\n\n296\n00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.610\nAnd they'll tell you, once a month\nyou need to cut wall power for\n\n297\n00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.064\nan hour to test out the systems and\nmake sure they're working.\n\n298\n00:14:51.064 --> 00:14:53.600\nThat's just part of your DR test.\n\n299\n00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.828\nAnd then every three years\nyou've gotta replace batteries.\n\n300\n00:14:55.828 --> 00:14:58.079\nAnd they'll try and\nwork it out in batches, so\n\n301\n00:14:58.079 --> 00:15:01.930\nyou replace a third of your batteries\neach year, so it's a constant cycle.\n\n302\n00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:05.793\nThat way, you've always got a couple\nof fresh batteries in the mix,\n\n303\n00:15:05.793 --> 00:15:08.723\nas opposed to on the 364th\nday of the second year,\n\n304\n00:15:08.723 --> 00:15:11.530\nall of your batteries\nare almost three years old.\n\n305\n00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.210\nYou don't want that, right?\n\n306\n00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.298\nSo normally, work out a rotation so\nthat it's being refreshed that way.\n\n307\n00:15:16.298 --> 00:15:17.800\nBut it is important to do it.\n\n308\n00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.333\nIt's routine maintenance,\nit's scheduled maintenance.\n\n309\n00:15:19.333 --> 00:15:23.170\nIt's expensive, but it's necessary to\nkeep the UPS running at peak performance.\n\n310\n00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:23.727\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n311\n00:15:23.727 --> 00:15:27.984\nnow I'm gonna be the one that's gonna use\nDon's credit card to purchase the UPS.\n\n312\n00:15:27.984 --> 00:15:31.707\nSo the question is, if I have a couple\nservers, if I've got 100 servers,\n\n313\n00:15:31.707 --> 00:15:35.088\nif I have 1,000 servers,\nhow can I tell whether I need one of those\n\n314\n00:15:35.088 --> 00:15:37.702\nbig\n&gt;&gt; Locker room, closet type [LAUGH] size\n\n315\n00:15:37.702 --> 00:15:42.254\nUPS's versus something smaller like\nwe have in the closet behind us.\n\n316\n00:15:42.254 --> 00:15:44.450\n&gt;&gt; It's all gonna come down\nto maximum load, right.\n\n317\n00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.502\nThe amount of power your\nserver's are drawing.\n\n318\n00:15:46.502 --> 00:15:49.361\nWhen you buy a server, it may have one or\n\n319\n00:15:49.361 --> 00:15:54.054\ntwo power supplies in it, and\nit will have a variable load on it.\n\n320\n00:15:54.054 --> 00:15:58.183\nWhen you're running normal, both power\nsupplies are probably running at 50% but\n\n321\n00:15:58.183 --> 00:16:00.202\nthey might even be going lower or higher.\n\n322\n00:16:00.202 --> 00:16:04.876\nThey might be 400 watt power supplies,\nbut they're typically averaging 200 or\n\n323\n00:16:04.876 --> 00:16:05.972\n150 watts each.\n\n324\n00:16:05.972 --> 00:16:08.000\nBecause your server's not under full load.\n\n325\n00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.890\nIf your server has 16 drive bays in it,\n\n326\n00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.620\nfull load would be all\n16 drive bays populated.\n\n327\n00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:18.140\nBut if you've only got two hard drives\nin there, there's 14 empty bays,\n\n328\n00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.285\nthat's power it's not drawing.\n\n329\n00:16:19.285 --> 00:16:21.370\nSo it's not going to be at maximum load.\n\n330\n00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.750\nSo you've gotta figure out\nwhat the maximum load is,\n\n331\n00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:27.190\nbecause you might only have two\nhard drives in it today, but\n\n332\n00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.230\na year from now you might fill\nout the rest those with drives.\n\n333\n00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:34.970\nSo anytime you bring equipment in,\nswitches, routers, fire walls, servers,\n\n334\n00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.910\nanything like that, monitors,\nif they're gonna be on the UPS also.\n\n335\n00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.780\nWe usually don't do monitors,\nbut you might.\n\n336\n00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.850\nYou need to find out what\ntheir maximum load is.\n\n337\n00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.450\nWhat's the maximum power\ndraw they're gonna generate?\n\n338\n00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.850\nAnd you've really gotta pay attention\nto the amps that they draw.\n\n339\n00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:51.000\nBecause the amps are kinda the hard part.\n\n340\n00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.040\nVoltage is important.\n\n341\n00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:52.840\nAnd voltage and amps,\n\n342\n00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:59.320\nwe multiply together to create what our\nactual power is going to be, or wattage.\n\n343\n00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.990\nBut the amps are usually what we pay\nattention to because we've got to make\n\n344\n00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:03.090\nsure we provide that.\n\n345\n00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.170\nSo, when you look at these UPSs like,\nthese are APC symmetras and\n\n346\n00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:10.254\nyou'll see where some of them\nare listed at 400,000 V A or\n\n347\n00:17:10.254 --> 00:17:13.850\n10,000 V A or kilo-V A.\n\n348\n00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:18.050\nSo, we're getting that information here as\nfar as how much it can actually provide.\n\n349\n00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:19.440\nAnd so is that gonna be enough?\n\n350\n00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.380\nThat may be way over what I need, I might\nbe able to use just two or three desktop\n\n351\n00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:29.990\nUPSs, which are usually only 1500 volt or\nso, they're not really all that high.\n\n352\n00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:32.850\nVersus these that are,\nwe're talking about kilovoltage.\n\n353\n00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.930\nWe're really really up there.\n\n354\n00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.600\nAnd APC is probably one of the biggest\nleaders in this market, but\n\n355\n00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.360\nthere's plenty of others.\n\n356\n00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.640\nMitsubishi is one that I've used at\nseveral locations where they make\n\n357\n00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.290\nthe MegaPods and Diamonds and stuff.\n\n358\n00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.420\nAnd it's the same thing, if you look at\nsome of these when you go through and\n\n359\n00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.540\nspec one out.\n\n360\n00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:56.010\nSo like if I were to do a DiamondPlus\nyou'll see that it's got\n\n361\n00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.430\na 10- to 50- kVA rating.\n\n362\n00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:02.000\nI can step up to the 1100B and\nget to 10- to 80- kVA.\n\n363\n00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.750\nSo it's all based on how much load\nI'm actually gonna be drawing,\n\n364\n00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.830\nthat's how I pick.\n\n365\n00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.880\nAnd you always wanna make sure you've\ngot some kind of expandable solution.\n\n366\n00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.480\nOne where you can add more boxes to it\nto grow it, like the 9000s down here.\n\n367\n00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.990\nSee how we can kinda grow it,\nadding more and more batteries to it,\n\n368\n00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:17.460\nto make that sure you can expand.\n\n369\n00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.550\nBecause you will expand,\nyou will add more equipment.\n\n370\n00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.380\nUnless you're going to the Cloud,\nin which case you might start reducing.\n\n371\n00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.290\nAnd if you're reducing\nthere may come a time\n\n372\n00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:26.600\nwhere you can take\nbatteries out of the mix.\n\n373\n00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.880\nAnd that will save you money over the long\nrun cuz you're not charging those\n\n374\n00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.060\nbatteries and you're not having to\ndo maintenance on those batteries.\n\n375\n00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.330\nYou take them out of the mix.\n\n376\n00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.090\nSome people will start to shrink their\ndata center and they will keep these\n\n377\n00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:40.500\nmassive batteries arrays, thinking I\ncould run that much longer on battery.\n\n378\n00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.640\nI say the same thing I\nalways say which is,\n\n379\n00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.330\nyou shouldn't be running on\na long time on the battery,\n\n380\n00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.080\nyou should only be be running on\na few minutes on the battery and\n\n381\n00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.400\nthen your generators do the work,\nso always keep that in mind.\n\n382\n00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.870\nAnd you know,\nI keep mentioning generators,\n\n383\n00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.220\nwhich isn't specifically\ncalled out in the objectives,\n\n384\n00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.970\nlet me just give you guys some examples\nof common generators that are out there.\n\n385\n00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:05.165\nThe two big names in power\ngenerators right now are Cummins and\n\n386\n00:19:05.165 --> 00:19:06.947\nCAT, Caterpillar.\n\n387\n00:19:06.947 --> 00:19:12.045\nYou also have like Generac and\na few others that are out there, but\n\n388\n00:19:12.045 --> 00:19:18.660\nCummins and CAT are the main ones, and\ntheir generators are massive structures.\n\n389\n00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.560\nIt's hard to tell scale from this picture,\nbut\n\n390\n00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.360\nif I was standing next to this, my head\nwould actually come up to about here.\n\n391\n00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.920\nSo it's about seven feet tall,\nI would say.\n\n392\n00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.430\nIt's a very tall structure,\nthis fan is gigantic.\n\n393\n00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.280\nI could step through this fan,\nthat's the size of this.\n\n394\n00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.590\nWell, I would die if I did that, but\nassuming the fan wasn't running,\n\n395\n00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:42.060\nI could step through it and\nthat's the size of it.\n\n396\n00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:47.180\nBut these generators are designed\nto have fuel placed into them\n\n397\n00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:52.100\nwhere they can run for days on end\nproviding power for your entire building.\n\n398\n00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:56.040\nAnd these things come down to\nthe same thing we have with UPSs,\n\n399\n00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.460\nhow much power can they generate?\n\n400\n00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.510\nAnd so you'll see right here,\n\n401\n00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:04.760\nall the different models, what's\nthe continuous kVas that I can provide?\n\n402\n00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.450\nAnd as you look down here,\nyou'll see the list of numbers,\n\n403\n00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:11.450\nwhat can we provide continuously\nover a period of time?\n\n404\n00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.150\nAnd that's gonna determine\nhow many of these we need.\n\n405\n00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.110\nNow at a minimum you need two generators,\ncuz if one fails,\n\n406\n00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.870\nyou want the other to take over.\n\n407\n00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:21.760\nBut which two do you get,\nwhich level do you get?\n\n408\n00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.670\nAnd then do you need three or\nfour or five or six of them?\n\n409\n00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:28.340\nMaybe two, even the maximum model is\njust not providing enough power for\n\n410\n00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.070\nyour data center, and so\nyou've got to switch there.\n\n411\n00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.240\nYou'll see where CAT,\nthey've got a lot of different models.\n\n412\n00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.820\nThey have the big self-contained ones and\n\n413\n00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.040\nthen they have the larger ones\nlike what I just showed you.\n\n414\n00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.390\nHere, so this one looks almost identical\nto what we saw a moment ago, or actually\n\n415\n00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.430\nthis one over here looks almost identical\nto that Cummins one that I showed you.\n\n416\n00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:51.160\nThe same principle, big diesel motored,\na bunch of copper coils inside of it.\n\n417\n00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.670\nIt's generating electricity and\nfeeding in your building.\n\n418\n00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:57.070\nTypically it's gonna feed in\nthe building as 208 or as 480,\n\n419\n00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:00.750\nand when it feeds that in it's\ngoing to be three-phase power.\n\n420\n00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.430\nThey're not actually calling\nit out on here, which,\n\n421\n00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:08.040\nI mean I'd be surprised if any\nof these weren't three-phase.\n\n422\n00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.010\nBut they're not listing whether it's 480.\n\n423\n00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:12.920\nI probably have to go into\nthe tech details to find out.\n\n424\n00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.940\nDid they list it over here?\n\n425\n00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.610\nThey didn't list it here either, did they.\n\n426\n00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:20.800\nBut it'll usually be 208 or 480 and it'll\nnormally be more than one leg of it too.\n\n427\n00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.670\nThat it can provide that power,\nespecially on the larger ones.\n\n428\n00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.990\nSo this is kind of the back-up\nto the battery back-up.\n\n429\n00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:29.180\nAnd this is what we're really trying\nto get to with the data center.\n\n430\n00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.640\nNow when we start to run these into\nour building, a lot of these devices,\n\n431\n00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.110\nespecially the UPSs,\nwill have remote management functionality.\n\n432\n00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:39.360\nWe're able to remotely connect in.\n\n433\n00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.740\nMost of them do have a screen on them,\nwhich is kind of hard to see,\n\n434\n00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.580\nlet me see if I have\na bigger picture of this.\n\n435\n00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:48.800\nThere will be an LCD or LED that'll be up\nat the top, so you can actually look at\n\n436\n00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:53.690\nwhat the current load is on it, as well\nas the health of the battery and so on.\n\n437\n00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.840\nBut they've always got software that you\ncan use to connect in to monitor them too.\n\n438\n00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.780\nAnd get alerts, so that you can get\nan email when certain things happen.\n\n439\n00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:03.606\nOr text, it can do paging, so\non to keep you up-to-date.\n\n440\n00:22:03.606 --> 00:22:05.660\nSo mostly this is gonna\nhave remote management.\n\n441\n00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.450\nThat's part of what you're paying for,\nthat's why these things are so\n\n442\n00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:10.000\nincredibly expensive.\n\n443\n00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.970\nAnd then we always need to have\nbypass procedures in place.\n\n444\n00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:16.655\nBecause when you do battery maintenance on\nthese you'll typically need to take them\n\n445\n00:22:16.655 --> 00:22:17.490\noffline.\n\n446\n00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:20.180\nWell if all of your power is\nbeing fed through the UPS and\n\n447\n00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.040\nyou take it offline, what's gonna happen?\n\n448\n00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.040\nAll your stuff's gonna lose power.\n\n449\n00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.630\nSo typically you'll have,\nI mean I shouldn't say typically,\n\n450\n00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.990\nalways you will have a certified\nelectrician come in to install these.\n\n451\n00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.630\nThese are way too powerful for\njust a regular person to plug in,\n\n452\n00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:35.750\nyou will kill yourself.\n\n453\n00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:40.120\nIt's this is far beyond hurt yourself,\nthis is kill yourself power.\n\n454\n00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.920\nSo you need to have a certified\nelectrician to install it.\n\n455\n00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:47.041\nAnd they can put in a bypass lever,\nit's a big lever you crank down, and\n\n456\n00:22:47.041 --> 00:22:49.670\nit will cut you over\nto regular wall power.\n\n457\n00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:53.650\nAnd when you do that, you might choose\nto already fire up your generators\n\n458\n00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:58.500\nahead of time and be running on\ngenerator while you bypass the UPSs\n\n459\n00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.515\njust in case there is an actual\npower outage at the same time.\n\n460\n00:23:01.515 --> 00:23:04.595\nCuz otherwise there's nothing providing\nthat buffer time for you to failover.\n\n461\n00:23:04.595 --> 00:23:07.305\nIt should be part of your\nmaintenance procedure as you flip.\n\n462\n00:23:07.305 --> 00:23:11.955\nSo that's a key concern as you\ntest out your UPSs and so on.\n\n463\n00:23:11.955 --> 00:23:15.135\nSo the world of UPSs,\nwhen it comes to data centers,\n\n464\n00:23:15.135 --> 00:23:19.305\nis a lot of different than that box\nthat you stick under your desk to\n\n465\n00:23:19.305 --> 00:23:22.320\nkeep your computer going\nwhile the power is out.\n\n466\n00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.550\nFor a data center, it's just so\nmuch power that you're drawing.\n\n467\n00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.070\nSo much coming out of the servers,\nout of the switches,\n\n468\n00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.840\nout of the firewalls and routers.\n\n469\n00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:34.660\nIt's a lot, and they're expecting\na constant level of power, and\n\n470\n00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:40.120\na lot of times they're expecting 240,\nor 220, not 110 or 120.\n\n471\n00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.860\nThey're expecting a higher\nfrequency to be coming in.\n\n472\n00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.440\nAnd that's not what our normal home\nUPSs or whatever are gonna provide.\n\n473\n00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.900\nSo you gotta make sure that you're\noperating at the right level for\n\n474\n00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.380\nthe equipment that you're\ntrying to maintain.\n\n475\n00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.140\nAnd that's another big selling\npoint of going to the Cloud,\n\n476\n00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.010\nis pick a small data center like ours.\n\n477\n00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:00.255\nWe're not gonna have giant\ngenerators outside the building.\n\n478\n00:24:00.255 --> 00:24:03.097\nWe actually have giant cement pads\nout there for the generators, but\n\n479\n00:24:03.097 --> 00:24:04.574\nwe don't have generators in them.\n\n480\n00:24:04.574 --> 00:24:06.121\nSo they don't work without the generators.\n\n481\n00:24:06.121 --> 00:24:11.007\nSo we're just not going to have that,\nbecause we don't have the need.\n\n482\n00:24:11.007 --> 00:24:13.640\nWe are not on\na mission-critical environment.\n\n483\n00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.500\nBut if we were a hospital or\na financial institution,\n\n484\n00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:21.730\nwhere they had a critical service level\nagreement that they had to maintain.\n\n485\n00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:23.880\nYou are going to have those generators.\n\n486\n00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.600\nIt's going to be a necessary\npart of your solution and\n\n487\n00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:32.150\nyou just need to make sure that you've got\nit specked out right for your environment.\n\n488\n00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:34.750\n&gt;&gt; And Don, I know it's not\non the objectives here too.\n\n489\n00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.660\nWouldn't they have potentially even go\nfarther than that, and even have things\n\n490\n00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.560\nlike redundant electrical grids and stuff\nas well too, if it gets real critical?\n\n491\n00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Wes.\nI\n\n492\n00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:45.060\nknow we talked about redundant\npower grids in another episode and\n\n493\n00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:48.890\nIf you've got a critical infrastructure\nyou absolutely want that.\n\n494\n00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.660\nYou more than likely, pretty much anywhere\nthat you can get power you can get\n\n495\n00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.290\nmultiple legs to the same power grid.\n\n496\n00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:57.730\nBut getting multiple power grids,\nthat's not available everywhere.\n\n497\n00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:01.530\nRight here, if we wanted multiple power\ngrids to this building, tough luck.\n\n498\n00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:02.120\nWe can't have it.\n\n499\n00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.770\nNow we have nine different\nlegs to the same power grid,\n\n500\n00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.890\nwe've got really good coverage there.\n\n501\n00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:10.290\nBut we're only connected to one grid.\n\n502\n00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.170\nSo it's not even an option for us.\n\n503\n00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:14.780\nThere's no way for\nus to get a second grid here.\n\n504\n00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.580\nAnd that's where generators and\nUPSs become that much more\n\n505\n00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.810\nimportant if you don't have the option for\na second grid.\n\n506\n00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:24.350\nIf you have a second grid and\none goes down, the second one's still up.\n\n507\n00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:28.070\nAnd you might not even need generators and\nUPSs.\n\n508\n00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.360\nYou probably need UPSs though,\n\n509\n00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.480\njust to handle the flip over to the other\ngrid because that does take a moment.\n\n510\n00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.260\nBut there's ways around that.\n\n511\n00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:36.960\nWe're gonna talk about PDUs.\n\n512\n00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.970\nAnd you can actually have PDUs where they\nwere running the two separate grids and\n\n513\n00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.086\nreally get rid there.\n\n514\n00:25:41.086 --> 00:25:43.180\nAnd you wouldn't even need to\nworry about UPSs at that point.\n\n515\n00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.960\nBut we're talking about costs that\nare really skyrocketing here.\n\n516\n00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:50.880\nSo we're really at military levels\nwhen you start talking about\n\n517\n00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.480\nthat level of redundancy.\n\n518\n00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.450\nIt's just not something\navailable to most people, and\n\n519\n00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:58.060\nthat's where UPS's combined with\ngenerators become that proper solution.\n\n520\n00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\nwell I'm looking at our objectives here.\n\n521\n00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:01.780\nI know that we do have more.\n\n522\n00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.830\nYou've already heard Don mention it,\nbut looks like we're gonna go ahead and\n\n523\n00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:05.860\ngo into a part two.\n\n524\n00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.450\nDon, before we do, do you have any\nadditional words of caution, maybe?\n\n525\n00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.490\nI know we've been talking\nabout electricity.\n\n526\n00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:14.220\nOr any additional words you\nmight like to tell our viewers.\n\n527\n00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.640\n&gt;&gt; All right, the maintenance.\n\n528\n00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.320\nI mentioned maintenance on batteries,\n\n529\n00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.560\nthat you've got to properly test\nthe batteries every so often.\n\n530\n00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.210\nYou've got to do the same\nthing with generators.\n\n531\n00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:23.510\nEven more important with generators,\n\n532\n00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:26.970\nbecause if they're diesel,\nthe diesel fuel can gel in the tanks and\n\n533\n00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:30.580\nit can actually clog the engine and stop\nit from working right when you need it.\n\n534\n00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.000\nSo you don't want that to happen.\n\n535\n00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.720\nDefinitely make sure you\ngot maintenance there.\n\n536\n00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.590\nAlso you need to be tracking the power\nconsumption of your servers.\n\n537\n00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.620\nAs you add more servers, as you add\nmore equipment into the servers,\n\n538\n00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.990\nthat's gonna increase their\nload that they generate.\n\n539\n00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:46.950\nAnd you've gotta make\nsure that your ups' and\n\n540\n00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:48.730\nyour generator's are able to handle that.\n\n541\n00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:53.070\nSo over time, you might have a project\nwhere you need to deploy ten more servers.\n\n542\n00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:55.690\nAnd you find their maximum load and\nyou run it against your system, and\n\n543\n00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:59.100\nyou find out where ooh,\nwe don't have enough power for that.\n\n544\n00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:03.770\nSo now it's not a matter of just buying\nten servers, you've gotta buy additional\n\n545\n00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:08.070\ngenerators or additional UPS units,\nbatteries or whatever, to power that.\n\n546\n00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:11.180\nAnd so it needs to become part of your\ncost calculation for every project.\n\n547\n00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:15.880\nI've seen many projects go over budget\nbecause they didn't take power and\n\n548\n00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.230\ncooling into consideration.\n\n549\n00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:18.890\nBecause you've gotta have AC units,\n\n550\n00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.910\nthey're cooling the heat\nthese systems generate.\n\n551\n00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.880\nSo paying attention to the BTUs,\nthe heat they generate,\n\n552\n00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:29.510\nas well as the power consumption\nare gonna be key and critical things.\n\n553\n00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.140\nAllright, Don.\n\n554\n00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.660\nWell, we appreciate you being\nhere in the studios with us and\n\n555\n00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.640\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n556\n00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.640\nWe're going to go ahead and\nsign of for IT ProTV.\n\n557\n00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.150\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n558\n00:27:39.150 -->

00:00:08.249\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:11.058\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.058 --> 00:00:14.460\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.330\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and\nin today's episode we are continuing\n\n7\n00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.070\nthrough our CompTIA Server+\nSK0004 Certification course.\n\n8\n00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.430\nAnd we're coming back with a part\ntwo on environmental controls.\n\n9\n00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.428\nAnd Don's here to lend his expertise\non hugging the environment.\n\n10\n00:00:30.428 --> 00:00:32.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n11\n00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.980\nIn this episode, we're gonna be\ntalking a little bit more about power.\n\n12\n00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.210\nAnd in part one, we talked about UPSs, all\nright, uninterruptible power supplies and\n\n13\n00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.750\nbatteries.\n\n14\n00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.340\nWe talked a little bit about\ngenerators and how they work.\n\n15\n00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.540\nWell, that was getting\npower into our building.\n\n16\n00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.430\nNow we actually need to\nget power to the servers.\n\n17\n00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.530\nAnd what we need to do that\nis what's called a PDU,\n\n18\n00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.840\nor a Power Distribution Unit.\n\n19\n00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.005\nNow Power Distribution Units, I mean\nit sounds like a technical term, and\n\n20\n00:00:58.005 --> 00:00:59.315\nit's all advanced and stuff, a PDU.\n\n21\n00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:02.465\nBut what we're really talking\nabout are power strips.\n\n22\n00:01:02.465 --> 00:01:05.735\nAnd most of us have power strips\nunder our desk, in our homes,\n\n23\n00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:07.235\nunder our dressers, whatever.\n\n24\n00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:11.015\nWhere we take one outlet on the wall and\nwe run it to a power strip,\n\n25\n00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:14.305\nwhere it now becomes six outlets, or eight\noutlets, and you can provide power for\n\n26\n00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:16.290\nall your little gadgets and devices.\n\n27\n00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.200\nWell, we use the same things in server\nrooms, except it's not exactly the same.\n\n28\n00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.860\nA regular power strip like what you'd buy\nat the store is not really very powerful.\n\n29\n00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.135\nI mean it might say it's\na surge suppressor and\n\n30\n00:01:29.135 --> 00:01:31.130\nhas all this crazy magic and stuff in it.\n\n31\n00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.670\nBut at the end of the day,\nit's taking the power from one outlet.\n\n32\n00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.960\nAnd then, evenly distributing it across\nthe other outlets, so that one device\n\n33\n00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.590\ncould draw too much power and effect\nother devices that are on the same link.\n\n34\n00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.180\nAnd they're not really designed\nto push too much power at all.\n\n35\n00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.500\nHere in the United States, when you\ngo to the store to buy a power strip,\n\n36\n00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.630\nthey're all going to be 120 volt, right.\n\n37\n00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.580\nYou're not gonna find ones\nthat are 240 at the store.\n\n38\n00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.760\nThey just, they don't sell those.\n\n39\n00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.730\nSo when we get into a server room,\nand I have a bunch of servers that\n\n40\n00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.650\nare all expecting 240, I can't just\nuse a regular all power strip.\n\n41\n00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.890\nI wouldn't want to anyway, right.\n\n42\n00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.590\nWe need stuff that designed for the data\ncenter, that is designed for higher levels\n\n43\n00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.610\nof power over longer periods of time,\nhigher levels of amperage or current.\n\n44\n00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.380\nSo that they can handle that\nwithout it catching on fire.\n\n45\n00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.110\nAnd that are better able to manage the\ndifferent workloads that we provide to it.\n\n46\n00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.790\nFor example, I might have 208\npower going into the strip.\n\n47\n00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.880\nAnd then the strip is providing 120 or\n\n48\n00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.040\n240 out to the nodes that\nare plugged into it, right?\n\n49\n00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.710\nSo the strip may actually be\nconverting the type of electricity.\n\n50\n00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.810\nAnd that means these power\nstrips that I'm talking about\n\n51\n00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.250\nare very different than\nwhat we're used to seeing.\n\n52\n00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.540\nSo let's start with some simple ones,\n\n53\n00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.710\nthen I'll get to some more advanced\nones as the episode goes on.\n\n54\n00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.690\nOn the simple side, at a minimum, we need\nour power strips to be rack mountable.\n\n55\n00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.290\nYou have racks in your data center.\n\n56\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.350\nAnd so these power strips, you don't\nwant them just laying on the floor.\n\n57\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.818\nThey need to be rack mounted.\n\n58\n00:02:59.818 --> 00:03:04.661\nNow, key thing to be aware of here with\npower strips is that usually you will have\n\n59\n00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:06.270\na fire code for your area.\n\n60\n00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.010\nAnd your fire code will dictate how many\nof these power strips you could have.\n\n61\n00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.690\nFor example, I've seen people\nwhere they daisy chain PDUs.\n\n62\n00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.100\nAnd you're not allowed to do that.\n\n63\n00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.130\nA PDU has to directly plug into an outlet.\n\n64\n00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.110\nWell if you have a data center\nwith hundreds of racks,\n\n65\n00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.180\nthat means you're going to\nneed hundreds of outlets.\n\n66\n00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.950\nYou're going to need a certified\nelectrician to put outlets by each rack.\n\n67\n00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.800\nWhen you look at the racks behind me,\n\n68\n00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.580\nthere is actually a set of outlets at the\nbottom on the ground underneath each rack.\n\n69\n00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.240\nAnd so the PDUs that are in that rack\nplug right into the outlets right there.\n\n70\n00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.210\nThey're not daisy chained or linked\nbecause that, well, first off, it further\n\n71\n00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.340\ndistributes out the power, and weakens\nthe amount of power that you can provide.\n\n72\n00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.570\nAnd then secondly, it's a fire hazard.\n\n73\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.360\nIt could potentially catch on fire.\n\n74\n00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.540\nAnd fires in a data center are really bad.\n\n75\n00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.620\nWe're gonna talk about fire control,\nmaybe in this episode,\n\n76\n00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.190\nprobably in part three, but\nwe'll get to fire control, too.\n\n77\n00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.277\nBut on the PDU side of things, these are\ngoing to need to plug into actual outlets.\n\n78\n00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:09.868\nAnd so when you buy PDUs for a server\nroom, unlike the little power strips you\n\n79\n00:04:09.868 --> 00:04:14.060\nget at home that might have a 3 foot or\na one meter cord on them.\n\n80\n00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.910\nThese are usually gonna have 25 or\n30 foot cords on them,\n\n81\n00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.930\nbecause they're designed to run to\noutlets that might be further away.\n\n82\n00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.240\nAnd some of them don't\neven come with cords.\n\n83\n00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.980\nThey expect an electrician to come in and\n\n84\n00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.210\ncustom cut the cord to fit\nthe environment that you need.\n\n85\n00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.050\nThat is very common also.\n\n86\n00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.850\nSo just be aware that there's different\nlevels of power distribution units\n\n87\n00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.780\nthat are out there.\n\n88\n00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.570\nAnd some of them have really impressive\ntechnology built right into them.\n\n89\n00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.560\nSome are very basic.\n\n90\n00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.950\nSo let's start with a basic one.\n\n91\n00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.880\nI've actually got a couple\nlaying on the floor here.\n\n92\n00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.909\nI'm gonna grab a small one.\n\n93\n00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.942\nAnd bring this one up.\n\n94\n00:04:45.942 --> 00:04:49.626\nNow, this small one as\nI dash off camera here,\n\n95\n00:04:49.626 --> 00:04:54.742\nthis small one is designed for\na standard 120 volt workload.\n\n96\n00:04:54.742 --> 00:04:59.372\nLike what you would see in a just\na regular office shop server or laptop,\n\n97\n00:04:59.372 --> 00:05:02.550\nany kind of electronic\ndevice router switches.\n\n98\n00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.970\nA lot of them are all designed\nto receive 110 or 120 outlet so\n\n99\n00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.630\nthat's what this provides.\n\n100\n00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.770\nAnd if you look across the front, what I'm\nseeing are a bunch of, these are standard\n\n101\n00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.990\ngrounded NEMA 15 outlets, which is what\nwe use here in the US or NEMA 5-15.\n\n102\n00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.406\nSo I see all those outlets.\n\n103\n00:05:19.406 --> 00:05:22.670\nI can see that it's providing some\nsurge suppression or whatever,\n\n104\n00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.462\nwhich we don't worry so much about surge\nsuppression inside of a data center.\n\n105\n00:05:26.462 --> 00:05:29.642\nBecause these PDUs are not normally\nplugged directly into wall power,\n\n106\n00:05:29.642 --> 00:05:31.790\nthey're normally plugged into UPS's.\n\n107\n00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.350\nAnd the UPS's do all the power\nconditioning for us so\n\n108\n00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.850\nwe don't get surges.\n\n109\n00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.360\nSo when you buy these,\n\n110\n00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.090\nyou might be thinking your home equipment\nwhere I need a surge suppressor.\n\n111\n00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.610\nBut in your data center, you really don't,\n\n112\n00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.590\nbecause your power conditioning should\nalready be happening at the UPSs.\n\n113\n00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.220\nThe UPSs act as the surge suppression for\nyou.\n\n114\n00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.720\nHas got a power switch,\nif I point to the right side over here.\n\n115\n00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.910\nAnd see how it's got\nthis plastic cover on it.\n\n116\n00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.350\nYou'll see that pretty often where there's\na plastic cover on the power switches.\n\n117\n00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.450\nBecause they want to prevent you from\naccidentally powering it off and\n\n118\n00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.630\nknocking the whole strip out.\n\n119\n00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.020\nSo we've got that.\n\n120\n00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.560\nIf we look on the back side,\nlet's switch over to our sky cam, so\n\n121\n00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.340\nwe can kind of see this a little better.\n\n122\n00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.623\nSo I was just showing you the front side.\n\n123\n00:06:09.623 --> 00:06:13.100\nWe saw all these outlets and\nthe power switch and so on.\n\n124\n00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.110\nOn the back side, I've got another\nset of outlets, all right?\n\n125\n00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.942\nNow why two sets of outlets on this thing?\n\n126\n00:06:18.942 --> 00:06:22.500\nWell, it's rack mountable,\nso it's got rack ears.\n\n127\n00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.920\nAnd when I mount it in the rack, this\nis gonna be pointing either forwards or\n\n128\n00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.800\nbackwards, depending on how I mount it.\n\n129\n00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.180\nSo anything that needs a power\noutlet on the front would have it.\n\n130\n00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.400\nBut what about the stuff that's behind it?\n\n131\n00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.700\nI would have to run the cable out and\nloop behind it, which is a pain.\n\n132\n00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.340\nSo this one actually has outlets on\nboth sides to be able to provide that.\n\n133\n00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.600\nNow this is a horizontal PDU,\na horizontal power distribution unit.\n\n134\n00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.910\nAnd so it goes into the rack sideways,\nhorizontally.\n\n135\n00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.054\nAnd we've said this before,\n\n136\n00:06:51.054 --> 00:06:53.720\nthat when you have something like\nthis it's measured in rack units.\n\n137\n00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.320\nSo this is one rack unit or\n1.75 inches tall.\n\n138\n00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.720\nAnd it's 19 inches wide because\nthat's the standard rack width\n\n139\n00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.780\nthat we see in computer racks.\n\n140\n00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.230\nYou can only get so\nmany outlets in 19 inches.\n\n141\n00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.730\nIf I needed more,\nit might have to go to 2U or\n\n142\n00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.760\neven 3U to provide the extra outlets.\n\n143\n00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.180\nOr, they stick the outlets on the back\nside, and that's what you see here.\n\n144\n00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.197\nNow, these are typical 3 prong outlets.\n\n145\n00:07:18.197 --> 00:07:20.829\nA lot of times,\nyou'll see a slightly different plug,\n\n146\n00:07:20.829 --> 00:07:23.242\nwhich I'll show some pictures\nof here in a moment.\n\n147\n00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:28.070\nWhere it is, instead of a female connector\nlike this, it's a male connector.\n\n148\n00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.160\nAnd it's the opposite end of a d plug,\n\n149\n00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.870\nwhat you'd see in the power\nsupply of a computer.\n\n150\n00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.240\nAnd you'll pop those in.\n\n151\n00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.460\nThey'll take a slightly different cable.\n\n152\n00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.333\nThose are a little more\nresistant to coming loose.\n\n153\n00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:42.347\nThree prong connections like these can\nwiggle, they can come loose and fall out,\n\n154\n00:07:42.347 --> 00:07:43.850\nand now you lose power.\n\n155\n00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.680\nThe other connectors they pop in and\nthey hold a little tighter.\n\n156\n00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.850\nThey have that big around the outside\nthat kind of locks them in place.\n\n157\n00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.720\nI'll show you guys\na picture in a little bit.\n\n158\n00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.957\nBut this is an example\nof a horizontal PDU.\n\n159\n00:07:55.957 --> 00:07:58.639\nThese are pretty cheap and\nnot particularly special.\n\n160\n00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:02.394\nThis is probably the lowest end of\na PDU that you'd see in a server rack.\n\n161\n00:08:02.394 --> 00:08:06.113\nCuz all it's really doing Is\ntaking that single connection,\n\n162\n00:08:06.113 --> 00:08:11.160\nusually 120 in this case and\nthen popping it out into multiple outlets.\n\n163\n00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.270\nWhatever amps I'm pulling in on this\n\n164\n00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.180\nis the maximum amount of amps that\nI can put out on all these ports.\n\n165\n00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:23.610\nSo even though I've got, what do I have\nhere, 10, 11, 12, 12 outlets, so even\n\n166\n00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.840\nthough I've got 12 outlets, that doesn't\nmean I can pull 20 amps on each outlet.\n\n167\n00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.490\nThat means that I might\nonly have 30 amps or\n\n168\n00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.750\n40 amps to divide across all 12 outlets.\n\n169\n00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.650\nAnd so, I've always gotta keep that in\nmind with any PDU, cheap or expensive,\n\n170\n00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:42.430\nthat you can only take out as much\npower as you put in on a lot of these.\n\n171\n00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:45.670\nAnd see,\nyou've got to make sure you track that.\n\n172\n00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:46.886\nLet's go a little more expensive.\n\n173\n00:08:46.886 --> 00:08:50.830\nSo that PDU right there,\nthat was pretty low end.\n\n174\n00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.500\nIf we go a little higher\nwe'll get ones like these.\n\n175\n00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.630\nNow, this is a vertical PDU.\n\n176\n00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.790\nAnd I'm gonna stand it\non the floor next to me.\n\n177\n00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.250\nSo it's actually on the ground.\n\n178\n00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:05.080\nI am 5 foot 11, I'm just shy of 6 feet.\n\n179\n00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:10.810\nThis thing is probably 5 feet 4 inches or\nso, it's pretty tall.\n\n180\n00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.860\nThis is a very tall unit.\n\n181\n00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.830\nIt's designed to mount vertically,\nnot horizontally.\n\n182\n00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.100\nHorizontally, you got 19 inches.\n\n183\n00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.630\nBut vertically, on a 42 U rack,\nyou have like 70 inches or something.\n\n184\n00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.140\nYou've got a huge amount of room.\n\n185\n00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.460\nSo this can mount vertically in the rack.\n\n186\n00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.636\nMost server racks have room for\ntwo of these, one on each side.\n\n187\n00:09:30.636 --> 00:09:32.470\nAnd you can mount them behind the rails.\n\n188\n00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.740\nSo a lot of times they'll\ncall these zero U PDUs.\n\n189\n00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.760\nThey take zero rack units.\n\n190\n00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.280\nI can mount this inside of the rack and\n\n191\n00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.540\nit doesn't take away any space\nfrom having servers in there.\n\n192\n00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.850\nAnd the idea is that I\ncan take two of these.\n\n193\n00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.250\nMount one of each side of the rack and\n\n194\n00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.710\nnow I've got a whole bank of power\noutlets that are available on both sides.\n\n195\n00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.700\nNow, you put my servers in there and\nplug in and\n\n196\n00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.240\nget everybody with the necessary power.\n\n197\n00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.700\nSo pretty easy to get that in there,\ngenerated and in place.\n\n198\n00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.407\nNow, if we take a closer look at this,\nwe'll notice some variations on it that\n\n199\n00:10:03.407 --> 00:10:05.952\nmake it different from what\nI showed you a moment ago.\n\n200\n00:10:05.952 --> 00:10:08.232\nAnd unfortunately,\nthis thing's really big so\n\n201\n00:10:08.232 --> 00:10:11.510\nI can't turn it around all that much for\nus to see everything.\n\n202\n00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.280\nBut when you look at it,\n\n203\n00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.120\nyou're gonna notice that there's\nthese two big switches up here,\n\n204\n00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:21.360\nthese two big on, off switches and there's\na number 20 written on both of them.\n\n205\n00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.620\nAnd that means that when\nI apply power to this,\n\n206\n00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:29.230\nit's actually going to give me\ntwo banks of power, two banks.\n\n207\n00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:32.930\nAnd that's what this B1 and\nB2 is written down here below.\n\n208\n00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.830\nSo the outlets that I've got across\nthis are divided up in those two banks.\n\n209\n00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.780\nAnd if you look at the little text\nnote that's kinda written on here,\n\n210\n00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:45.400\nit's telling me it's\noutputting 120 volts AC.\n\n211\n00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:53.290\nIt's at 50 or 60 or 24 amps max,\n16 amps max per outlet, 16 amps per bank.\n\n212\n00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:58.700\nSo that 24 amps max and\n16 amps per bank, kinda conflicts.\n\n213\n00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:03.530\nIf I have 2 banks, I might think\nthat I get 32 amps, but I don't.\n\n214\n00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.253\nI have a max of 24 amps.\n\n215\n00:11:05.253 --> 00:11:11.180\nOne bank could go up to 16 amps, but\nit couldn't go to 17 or 18 amps.\n\n216\n00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.370\nSo now when I start plugging things into\nthis strip, I need to make sure that I'm\n\n217\n00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:19.370\nspreading it out across the banks for\nan even distribution.\n\n218\n00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:23.130\nAnd so, if I look a little further down it\nif we kinda zoom out and take a look at\n\n219\n00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.630\nthe strip as a whole, I guess this\nis really been kinda hard to do.\n\n220\n00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.725\nThe first 12 outlets here, that's bank 1.\n\n221\n00:11:30.725 --> 00:11:34.370\nAnd then, I've got another 12 outlets on\nthe back side and that's gonna be bank 2.\n\n222\n00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:39.290\nAnd so, all of these outlets\nare designed to be low down the cross.\n\n223\n00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:43.500\nIf I have a server with two power\nsupplies, I can run one power supply each\n\n224\n00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.056\nbank, and get a little bit of redundancy\nthere or at least be able to distribute\n\n225\n00:11:48.056 --> 00:11:52.428\nthe amperage across it and get pull\nthe maximum amperage out of this strip.\n\n226\n00:11:52.428 --> 00:11:56.729\nNow, because it's pulling all these\noutlets and distributing all of that\n\n227\n00:11:56.729 --> 00:12:02.240\namperage, it's usually gonna be providing\nmore than a typical 120 outlet can do.\n\n228\n00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.870\nAnd so, it's bringing in multiphase power.\n\n229\n00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.370\nAnd it's pulling in, I don't remember\nif this is a 208 or a 240 strip.\n\n230\n00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.905\nIt'll be written on here somewhere,\n\n231\n00:12:10.905 --> 00:12:16.600\n[LAUGH] if I could find the little notes\non it it'll tell me on here what it is.\n\n232\n00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.070\nBut it'll pull in either 240 or\n208 and convert it.\n\n233\n00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:25.150\nAnd so, it's using not a standard\nMIMA 15 plug but a twist lock plug.\n\n234\n00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.950\nSee how the plug is arranged in a circle,\nand\n\n235\n00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:32.730\nif you look at it from the side you'll\nsee how there's kind of a little tooth on\n\n236\n00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:36.410\neach blade and\nsome of them are bigger than others.\n\n237\n00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.410\nLike this one actually has a really,\n\n238\n00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.280\nreally big curved kinda blade\non the side of it there.\n\n239\n00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.580\nSo that when you plug it in,\nyou turn it and it locks into place.\n\n240\n00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.680\nAnd now you can't unplug, it's not gonna\naccidentally come out of the wall,\n\n241\n00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.180\nit's gonna be locked in there.\n\n242\n00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.450\nThis is very common for\nhigh voltage lines,\n\n243\n00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:58.750\nwhen you're running something at 208 or\n240, even higher\n\n244\n00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:03.950\nif we go into the 460, 480 type ranges,\nyou'll use twist locks like these,\n\n245\n00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:07.590\ncuz it locks them in place, and it helps\nprevent injury and accidental unplug.\n\n246\n00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.540\nSo it is a giant plug to\nbe able to provide this.\n\n247\n00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.810\nThose outlets that I mentioned that\nwe'd get run to the bottom of our racks,\n\n248\n00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.470\nthey're typically gonna\nbe outlets like this.\n\n249\n00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.187\nThey're not gonna be your standard\nNEMA 5-15 outlets like what we see on\n\n250\n00:13:19.187 --> 00:13:20.013\na typical wall.\n\n251\n00:13:20.013 --> 00:13:23.600\nThey're gonna be special ones that may\nbe providing higher amounts of power.\n\n252\n00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.963\nYou've always gotta keep track of your\namperage or your amps that you need.\n\n253\n00:13:26.963 --> 00:13:30.147\nAnd make sure you get the appropriate\npower to provide that.\n\n254\n00:13:30.147 --> 00:13:35.390\nNow, even here where, I said this is\na more expensive, more advanced one.\n\n255\n00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.210\nThis still isn't as\nadvanced as you can get.\n\n256\n00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.990\nThis is what they call a basic PDU,\nin fact,\n\n257\n00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.650\nit's even written on here, basic rack PDU.\n\n258\n00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.680\nSo this is just your typical\npower distribution unit.\n\n259\n00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:52.920\nFor me, what I like to buy, I like\nto get what are called metered PDUs.\n\n260\n00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.530\nMetered PDUs are a lot more expensive,\nbut they have logic built into them.\n\n261\n00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:00.210\nThey usually have a network jack\nthat you can plug into, and\n\n262\n00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.510\nyou can talk to the metered\nPDU via the network.\n\n263\n00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.490\nBut even the cheapest ones at least\nhave a little screen on them,\n\n264\n00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:12.000\na little LCD typically, that will tell you\nhow many amps you're pulling right then.\n\n265\n00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.680\nSo as you plug servers in,\n\n266\n00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.720\nyou don't necessary have to go digging\nthrough engineering documents to find out\n\n267\n00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.980\nwhat the the maximum load is because look\nright at the screen is I plug stuff in and\n\n268\n00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.010\nif I hit the limit, I can unplug some\nsomething and move it to somewhere else.\n\n269\n00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.550\nSo we can start to to kinda\nbalance out like that.\n\n270\n00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.740\nLet me show you APC's webpage.\n\n271\n00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:33.170\nAPC is probably the biggest seller\nof PDUs that are out there.\n\n272\n00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:34.520\nAnd so, they have PDUs.\n\n273\n00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.110\nLike here's one of their vertical models.\n\n274\n00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.300\nIt's just like what I've\ngot laying here beside me.\n\n275\n00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:43.660\nAnd you'll see that they've\ngot a ton of different models.\n\n276\n00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:48.390\nAnd some of these are going\nto be 15 amp or 20 amp or\n\n277\n00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:52.720\n30 amp some of them are 100 to 120 volt,\nothers are 208 volt.\n\n278\n00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:58.750\nYou're having to choose based on\nwhat your power needs happen to be.\n\n279\n00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.110\nAnd everybody's power needs\nare a little different.\n\n280\n00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:04.343\nThat's why we got to pay attention to what\nour servers are when we purchase them\n\n281\n00:15:04.343 --> 00:15:05.640\nand so on.\n\n282\n00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:11.690\nBut they're metered PDUs\nactually look very, very similar.\n\n283\n00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:13.560\nBut the difference is they\nhad that screen on them and\n\n284\n00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.350\nAPC doesn't have great\npictures on their site.\n\n285\n00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.851\nSo I'm gonna switch over to Tripp-Lite.\n\n286\n00:15:16.851 --> 00:15:19.300\nTripp-Lite also makes PDUs.\n\n287\n00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.060\nThey're another company that's pretty\nwidely used and they make horizontal and\n\n288\n00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.110\nvertical ones.\n\n289\n00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:29.270\nAnd they've got some great metered PDUs,\n\n290\n00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:34.400\nand so when look at this one,\nthis is a 3 phase 208, and\n\n291\n00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.610\nif I take a look at it,\nyou can see that dark gray,\n\n292\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:45.190\nmiddle gray, and light gray marking, this\none has 208 3 phase that comes in to it.\n\n293\n00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.920\nAnd then, it divides it out into\n\n294\n00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.380\nthree separate phases that\nspread across the outlets.\n\n295\n00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:55.650\nAnd the outlets are all colored dark,\nmiddle, and light gray.\n\n296\n00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:59.819\nSo as I look at the outlets, see how you\ngot them dark middle and light gray?\n\n297\n00:15:59.819 --> 00:16:01.187\nThose are the three phases.\n\n298\n00:16:01.187 --> 00:16:06.065\nAnd so, when I plug my servers in, I can\nplug into two different phases To make\n\n299\n00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:08.704\nsure that I balance the load across them.\n\n300\n00:16:08.704 --> 00:16:13.630\nAnd these are those reverse outlets that\nI was talking about that were kinda like\n\n301\n00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.922\nwhat's on the back of power supply.\n\n302\n00:16:15.922 --> 00:16:17.714\nI think I said they were\nmale outlets earlier.\n\n303\n00:16:17.714 --> 00:16:20.982\nThey're actually female outlets,\nbut you're able to plug them in and\n\n304\n00:16:20.982 --> 00:16:24.357\nyou'll see where it's not your typical\nthree pronged wall type outlet,\n\n305\n00:16:24.357 --> 00:16:27.480\nit's more like what you would see\non a computer where you plug it in.\n\n306\n00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.560\nIt's almost like what you would use for\n\n307\n00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.580\nan extension cable if you were\ntrying to extend out a D plug.\n\n308\n00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.170\nBut you can plugin with those and\nthey stay in a little better.\n\n309\n00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:39.971\nAnd then, you'll see some of the other\nvariants of that, which some switches use.\n\n310\n00:16:39.971 --> 00:16:45.260\nLike the big Cisco 6500 Series switches\nuse this larger outlet you see at the top.\n\n311\n00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.720\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\nI'm gonna have some fun here.\n\n312\n00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.950\nI'm gonna grab your credit card.\n\n313\n00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.862\nYou showed us all these great PDUs but\nwhen it comes down to it, and\n\n314\n00:16:51.862 --> 00:16:55.347\nI've got my money,\nI've got my server closet behind me,\n\n315\n00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:58.283\nwhat am I gonna use to\ndetermine which one to buy?\n\n316\n00:16:58.283 --> 00:17:00.353\n&gt;&gt; So It's gonna be just your needs.\n\n317\n00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:02.540\nYou might need a fancy one like this.\n\n318\n00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.281\nIf I need the ability to see the amps,\nI didn't even show that screen.\n\n319\n00:17:06.281 --> 00:17:08.012\nLet me go back to the picture here for\na second.\n\n320\n00:17:08.012 --> 00:17:12.119\nYou'll see this little LED where it's\nshowing me the leg one, leg two,\n\n321\n00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:13.880\nleg three, the three phases.\n\n322\n00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.030\nAnd how many amps I'm pulling.\n\n323\n00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.940\nOn each right now it's pulling\nnine amps off of each one of them.\n\n324\n00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.070\nSo I can see that right here.\n\n325\n00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:21.470\nAnd there's a network jack.\n\n326\n00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.150\nIt's actually on the other\nside of this thing.\n\n327\n00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:26.250\nWhere I can remote in and talk to it,\nand some of them get even smarter.\n\n328\n00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.920\nAPC has ones where you can remote in and\n\n329\n00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.360\nyou can turn individual outlets on and\noff.\n\n330\n00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.780\nI can cut the power to a single outlet and\nI can put power back on.\n\n331\n00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.540\nSo if I have a machine lock up,\nI can reset it that way.\n\n332\n00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.240\nIf you need all that then that's gonna\nhelp you pick which one you want.\n\n333\n00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.760\nBut it gets expensive.\n\n334\n00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.918\nThose ones that you can remote into,\nthey're like $1,200.\n\n335\n00:17:44.918 --> 00:17:48.210\n$1,200 for a power strip,\nthat's not what you're using at home.\n\n336\n00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:51.190\nBut in your server rack,\nthat may well be worth it.\n\n337\n00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:56.930\nBut the key deciding factor is just\ngoing to be how many amps you pull.\n\n338\n00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:00.370\nAnd what type of power your servers or\nother equipment are needing.\n\n339\n00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.750\nCuz you might have switches and firewalls\nand they're all gonna need power, too.\n\n340\n00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.330\nSo you've gotta take\nall that into account.\n\n341\n00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:06.950\nAnd it's probably not a one-size-fits-all.\n\n342\n00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:09.700\nYou're probably not gonna have\none standard PDU used everywhere.\n\n343\n00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.470\nEach rack may have different types\nof PDUs that are implemented.\n\n344\n00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:18.350\nAnd so, when you buy them, that's where it\nbasically comes into play that we start\n\n345\n00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.440\npicking and choosing our models.\n\n346\n00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.230\nSo I've got a Visio document fired up here\nwhere I've got a rack, a standard 42 rack.\n\n347\n00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.600\nAnd a couple of different\nPDUs in my diagram.\n\n348\n00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.610\nSo when I go to build this rack up,\n\n349\n00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:36.110\nI have to think about the servers that\nI'm getting and how I wanna arrange this.\n\n350\n00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.430\nIf I'm gonna have some network gear, but\n\n351\n00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:41.200\nmostly patch panels in here,\npatch panels don't need power.\n\n352\n00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.990\nSo I probably don't need a big\nvertically stretched one.\n\n353\n00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.850\nI might just go with horizontal PDUs.\n\n354\n00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:49.220\nAnd throw those in.\n\n355\n00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.080\nAnd there's different\nmodels of horizontal ones.\n\n356\n00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.910\nSome, like this one, is not actually\nwide enough to stretch the entire way.\n\n357\n00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.410\nAnd so, they usually have a little\nexpansion wing that sticks on the side\n\n358\n00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:58.850\nthat fill it out the rest of the way.\n\n359\n00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:02.858\nBut depending on the outlooks that I want,\nI'll buy the appropriate one.\n\n360\n00:19:02.858 --> 00:19:06.374\nMaybe we've got blade servers where all\nthe power supplies are at the bottom of\n\n361\n00:19:06.374 --> 00:19:07.670\nthe blade chassis.\n\n362\n00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:11.460\nSo it doesn't make sense to have vertical\nPDUs if all of the power supplies are down\n\n363\n00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.480\nat the bottom,\nI can just use horizontal one.\n\n364\n00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.050\nAnd they'll have a front side and a back\nside with different outlets on each so\n\n365\n00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:18.990\nthat's gonna impact which model you buy.\n\n366\n00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:22.460\nAs well as how many phases\nthey provide and so on.\n\n367\n00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.920\nIf I go vertical, there's big ones.\n\n368\n00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.830\nLike what I've got here.\n\n369\n00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.460\nThe one here on the desk by me is\nprobably about as tall as you can get and\n\n370\n00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.210\nstill fit inside of a rack.\n\n371\n00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:34.480\nAfter that you can get smaller ones,\nones that are not the full size of\n\n372\n00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:40.290\na rack.\n\n373\n00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.170\nThe big ones will actually stretch\nthe length of the racks so\n\n374\n00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:47.210\nif we take a big one, I can come in\nhere and mount it on the railing and\n\n375\n00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.940\nit will sit on the back side and\nnot interfere with the servers at all.\n\n376\n00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.853\nBut it will span pretty much\nthe entire height of the rack and\n\n377\n00:19:54.853 --> 00:19:58.590\nthen you're able to plug servers in\nall along and that works out great.\n\n378\n00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.720\nOr you can do multiples.\n\n379\n00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.550\nMultiple PDUs comes in really handy.\n\n380\n00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:08.570\nIf I have a UPS, and\nI have generators, that's great.\n\n381\n00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:13.450\nBut I might wanna have multiple UPSs and\nmultiple generators.\n\n382\n00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:18.181\nIn which case, I could divide up circuits\nwhere I have more than one circuit\n\n383\n00:20:18.181 --> 00:20:19.768\nrunning into each rack.\n\n384\n00:20:19.768 --> 00:20:21.033\nHave you ever tripped a fuse?\n\n385\n00:20:21.033 --> 00:20:22.780\nYou trip a fuse on a circuit.\n\n386\n00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.230\nAnd maybe you drew a few too many amps and\nthat circuit goes offline.\n\n387\n00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.568\nWell, if I had two power\nsupplies in my server and\n\n388\n00:20:28.568 --> 00:20:32.331\nboth power supplies were plugged into\nthe same circuit and the circuit trips,\n\n389\n00:20:32.331 --> 00:20:33.944\nboth power supplies go offline.\n\n390\n00:20:33.944 --> 00:20:35.475\nIf I have a UPS they can power it, but\n\n391\n00:20:35.475 --> 00:20:37.940\nif the UPS goes offline I might\nhave my own problem there.\n\n392\n00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.073\nAnd if they run to a generator and\nthe generator fails to start,\n\n393\n00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:41.640\nI could have my own problem there.\n\n394\n00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:46.850\nSo if I want true full redundancy,\nwhat we'd probably do is have\n\n395\n00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:51.885\ntwo generators, run to two different UPSs,\nrun to two different sets of circuits,\n\n396\n00:20:51.885 --> 00:20:54.810\ncuz you have many, many circuits, that\nare then run throughout the data center.\n\n397\n00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:58.110\nAnd in each rack, instead of\nhaving one big PDU like this one,\n\n398\n00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:00.140\nlet me just take it back out.\n\n399\n00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.979\nInstead of having one big PDU,\nyou'll get multiple smaller PDUs.\n\n400\n00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:11.650\nAnd you'll come in and just rack those,\nright inside of the rack,\n\n401\n00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.170\none on each side.\n\n402\n00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:17.430\nAnd as you plug your servers in,\nyou can just take those servers and\n\n403\n00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:22.300\nrun one power supply to the left, and\nthe other power supply to the right.\n\n404\n00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.070\nAnd now they're on two different circuits,\ntwo different UPSs,\n\n405\n00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.900\ntwo different generators.\n\n406\n00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:29.110\nIf you've got two different power grids,\nthese could be two different power grids.\n\n407\n00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:33.022\nOne could be whoever your local power\nprovider is, Con Ed or whoever it is.\n\n408\n00:21:33.022 --> 00:21:37.310\nAnd then,\nsome other power providers in your area.\n\n409\n00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.940\nI don't know that many power\nproviders to choose from.\n\n410\n00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.266\nWe have GRU here and\nmaybe, Clay Cooperative or\n\n411\n00:21:43.266 --> 00:21:45.518\nwhatever and that's about it.\n\n412\n00:21:45.518 --> 00:21:49.825\nSo you could actually have that divided up\nand now your cost is obviously climbing as\n\n413\n00:21:49.825 --> 00:21:54.150\nyou install this infrastructure but that's\nhow you get that through redundancy.\n\n414\n00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:58.280\nHow you get the ability to balance\nthe higher workloads that your\n\n415\n00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.820\nservers may well need.\n\n416\n00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.507\nAnd by having this mounted in the racks\nbasically inside in the side panels,\n\n417\n00:22:03.507 --> 00:22:05.300\nthat'll take any space.\n\n418\n00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.800\nYou can still fill up all the server\nslots, all the rack units here are still\n\n419\n00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:16.120\navailable, and we can go in and really\nmaximize what we're capable of doing.\n\n420\n00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.280\nAnd here you'll see,\nstill have multiple phases.\n\n421\n00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:24.828\nSo we can get additional current provided\ninto them to power our servers and\n\n422\n00:22:24.828 --> 00:22:26.426\nreally power things out.\n\n423\n00:22:26.426 --> 00:22:29.884\nSo just understand that a lot goes\ninto the decision of PDUs and\n\n424\n00:22:29.884 --> 00:22:33.556\nwhich ones we're gonna use and\nhow we're gonna implement them.\n\n425\n00:22:33.556 --> 00:22:37.880\nI think I talked about most\nof what I wanted to go on.\n\n426\n00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.400\nI did call out APC and\n\n427\n00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.180\nTripp Lite specifically just cuz those\nare two really big names in power.\n\n428\n00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.570\nBut there's plenty of other\nvendors out there that make them.\n\n429\n00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:53.739\nJust be aware that PDUs when we buy them,\nwe typically expect them to last forever.\n\n430\n00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:57.950\nIt's not like they wear down\nlike a hard drive or whatever.\n\n431\n00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:01.990\nBut you do still need to do some basic\nmaintenance on them just as far as testing\n\n432\n00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.559\nthem out.\n\n433\n00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:05.782\nA lot of people will take a multi meter,\nhowever you wanna say it, and\n\n434\n00:23:05.782 --> 00:23:09.503\njust test the outlets from time to time\nto make sure that you're getting the full\n\n435\n00:23:09.503 --> 00:23:11.415\ncapabilities those outlets provided.\n\n436\n00:23:11.415 --> 00:23:14.560\nIt's a good idea to check but\ntypically they don't fail.\n\n437\n00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.817\nThere's not really all that\nmuch to a PDU that can fail.\n\n438\n00:23:17.817 --> 00:23:20.563\nSome have fuses built into them and\nthe fuses can blow and\n\n439\n00:23:20.563 --> 00:23:22.030\nyou might have to replace it.\n\n440\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.170\nThis one does have fuses beside me.\n\n441\n00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:25.840\nBut, again,\n\n442\n00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.640\nin a normal environment that's not\nreally gonna be a problem that we have.\n\n443\n00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Don, we've been talking a lot\nabout electricity and one thing that we\n\n444\n00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:34.750\nhaven't talked about and maybe you\ncan help me out on this is grounding.\n\n445\n00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.330\nI know it's important to keep\nall your circuits grounded,\n\n446\n00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:38.490\nthere's different considerations.\n\n447\n00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:39.780\nHow about grounding?\n\n448\n00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.330\n&gt;&gt; So grounding is kinda weird\nwhen we get into this stuff.\n\n449\n00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:45.810\nLike, with the giant PDU that I\nwas showing you guys earlier.\n\n450\n00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.340\nIt's three prongs so\none of those is gonna be a ground,\n\n451\n00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.580\nI actually have no idea which one.\n\n452\n00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.750\nBut one of them will be a ground.\n\n453\n00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.510\nAnd it's gonna ground out that strip.\n\n454\n00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:53.230\nThat's great, right?\n\n455\n00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:56.300\nI plug my power into there,\nI got good stable ground.\n\n456\n00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:01.160\nIt's bolted onto the rack and so\ndoes the rack benefit from that grounding?\n\n457\n00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:01.751\nIt actually doesn't.\n\n458\n00:24:01.751 --> 00:24:05.506\nAnd there's an important reason for that\nbecause if I have two power strips that\n\n459\n00:24:05.506 --> 00:24:09.262\nare run to two different circuits that\npotentially could be run to two different\n\n460\n00:24:09.262 --> 00:24:12.513\npower grids altogether, That would\nbe a strange situation to try and\n\n461\n00:24:12.513 --> 00:24:15.670\nground out both of them and\nto count on that being reliable.\n\n462\n00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.620\nSo what you're gonna find is that yes,\nyour power strip's ground and\n\n463\n00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.950\nanything that's got a three prong plug\nis typically gonna have a ground to it.\n\n464\n00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.640\nSo you've got a nice,\nsafe electrical system.\n\n465\n00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.610\nBut your racks will typically\nneed to be grounded, also.\n\n466\n00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:33.810\nIn a commercial data center, you can kinda\nwalk across the backside of the racks and\n\n467\n00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:38.340\nyou'll notice these little, I think are\ncopper bolts, they might be brass bolts,\n\n468\n00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:42.280\nbut these little bolts that'll be in there\nwith what is typically a green wire.\n\n469\n00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.160\nIt doesn't have to be green but\nthey almost always run green for\n\n470\n00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:45.982\nwhatever reason.\n\n471\n00:24:45.982 --> 00:24:49.530\nAnd itll be a solid copper wire that will\nrun through a grounding system somewhere.\n\n472\n00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.730\nSometimes they run up to the roof grid and\nthey ground the roof grid somewhere else.\n\n473\n00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:56.270\nOther times, that green wire will run\nall the way back to some giant block.\n\n474\n00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.662\nAnd I guess you can't really see on\ncamera cuz it's been painted black, but\n\n475\n00:24:59.662 --> 00:25:02.895\nbehind me we actually have a grounding\nblock on the wall that has a bunch of\n\n476\n00:25:02.895 --> 00:25:04.380\nthose green wires running to it.\n\n477\n00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.190\nIt's been painted black so\nyou can't see it.\n\n478\n00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:09.870\nBut it helps to ground\nall that into one place.\n\n479\n00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:13.060\nAnd that way, if there is some kind\nof electrical surge that happens,\n\n480\n00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.180\nit can get dissipated\nright into that ground.\n\n481\n00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.060\nNow, where does that\nelectrical surge come from?\n\n482\n00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.980\nIn theory, if you've got UPSs\nthey're conditioning the line and\n\n483\n00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.430\nit doesn't happen.\n\n484\n00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:25.290\nBut we can create that surge, too.\n\n485\n00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:29.174\nRemember way back in the server components\nepisode where we took that server apart,\n\n486\n00:25:29.174 --> 00:25:32.100\nI put on an ESD wristband.\n\n487\n00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:36.490\nAnd I clipped it to the case\nof that server while I was\n\n488\n00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:38.990\nworking on it to discharge\nany electricity I had in me.\n\n489\n00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:43.080\nWell, your server racks\nshould be grounded.\n\n490\n00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.770\nAnd if they're grounded, when you go to\nwork on a server, you can take your ESD\n\n491\n00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:48.640\nwristband and instead of attaching\nit to the server that you might be\n\n492\n00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.410\npulling out or removing, it might be\nplugged in, it might be unplugged,\n\n493\n00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.970\nit might not have a reliable ground,\nyou can clip right onto the rack.\n\n494\n00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:59.530\nAnd when you clip onto that rack, now\nyou're grounded regardless of the status\n\n495\n00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:03.650\nof the server and you can work on it and\nknow that it's being done safely.\n\n496\n00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:08.190\nNow, I'll tell you a funny story,\nwhich is one of my embarrassing moments,\n\n497\n00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:12.480\nis I used to do server warranty repair for\nCompact and HP DC.\n\n498\n00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.858\nThat's really all the same company.\n\n499\n00:26:14.858 --> 00:26:18.040\nAnd so, [LAUGH] I used to go and\ndo field warranty repair for it.\n\n500\n00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.730\nAnd when you do that,\nI had to work on the servers and\n\n501\n00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:24.090\nI had to have my hands free, and the wrist\nbands really get in the way sometimes when\n\n502\n00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.460\nyou're working with the larger\nmemory boards and stuff.\n\n503\n00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:30.040\nAnd so, I used to use an ankle band,\none that would attach to my ankle, and\n\n504\n00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.010\nthen that way I could clip it onto\nthe rack and I would have my hands free.\n\n505\n00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.680\nAnd it worked great.\n\n506\n00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.290\nAnd the story I tell people,\nthe reason I stopped doing that is,\n\n507\n00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:41.460\nI was working on a server one day and\nsomebody asked me a question.\n\n508\n00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:45.790\nAnd so I turned to answer their\nquestion and when I was done,\n\n509\n00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.740\nI continued turning the same direction.\n\n510\n00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.240\nSo then I then was looking\nat the server again, but\n\n511\n00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.990\nmy ESD band was now wrapped around my\nankles, both ankles, and I didn't know it.\n\n512\n00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:59.890\nAnd so when I was done, I went to\nwalk away and I tripped and fell.\n\n513\n00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:04.280\nI fell on my face, and in server rooms we\nhave metal floor, you usually a sub floor.\n\n514\n00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.610\nIt doesn't feel too good and you look\nreally, really stupid when you do it.\n\n515\n00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:10.649\nKind of hard to play off that I'm a\nprofessional when I'm laying on the ground\n\n516\n00:27:10.649 --> 00:27:11.741\nwith a rope around my legs.\n\n517\n00:27:11.741 --> 00:27:14.374\nBut is that a situation?\n\n518\n00:27:14.374 --> 00:27:17.552\nSomebody's going to edit this sound\nbite and its going to sound silly, but\n\n519\n00:27:17.552 --> 00:27:20.390\nit is something that happens, so\nyou need to be careful with that.\n\n520\n00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.060\nYou're gonna need to ground yourself.\n\n521\n00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.730\nYou can ground to the rack.\n\n522\n00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.650\nThe wristband, while it does get in\nthe way, is at least entirely obvious and\n\n523\n00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:27.410\nyou remember it's there.\n\n524\n00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:28.900\nThe ankle ones are little more dangerous.\n\n525\n00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.300\nI don't use those any more.\n\n526\n00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.420\nBut you can't round to that.\n\n527\n00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.180\nSo just be aware that even though\nyour PDUs are grounded and\n\n528\n00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.170\nthat they are providing high levels very,\n\n529\n00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:42.200\nvery safely, you don't wanna connect\nyour ESD wristband to a PDU.\n\n530\n00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.700\nThat's a recipe for disaster.\n\n531\n00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:44.630\nDon't do that.\n\n532\n00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:48.090\nAttach your wristband to the rack,\nthe rack should be grounded.\n\n533\n00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:51.010\nIf you're not sure if the rack\nis grounded, or if you know for\n\n534\n00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:55.480\na fact the rack is not grounded, then\nattach your ESD wristband to the server,\n\n535\n00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.430\nto the metal casing on the server,\nthe chassis.\n\n536\n00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:00.350\nThat's gonna be your best bet there.\n\n537\n00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:03.635\nBut if you know the rack is grounded,\ndefinitely attach that, it's easier and\n\n538\n00:28:03.635 --> 00:28:04.773\nit doesn't get in the way.\n\n539\n00:28:04.773 --> 00:28:06.668\n&gt;&gt; All right Don,\nwell that's a lot of great information.\n\n540\n00:28:06.668 --> 00:28:08.535\nNow, I know that we've\ngot some more to go,\n\n541\n00:28:08.535 --> 00:28:11.175\nwe've got more safety procedures\nthat you wanna let us know.\n\n542\n00:28:11.175 --> 00:28:13.385\nBut it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n543\n00:28:13.385 --> 00:28:13.985\nSo how about this?\n\n544\n00:28:13.985 --> 00:28:17.205\nHow about we go ahead, we'll stop it here,\nwe'll go into a part two.\n\n545\n00:28:17.205 --> 00:28:18.115\nAnd then you can come back and\n\n546\n00:28:18.115 --> 00:28:21.395\nyou can finish up some of the other topics\nI know that you still have to talk about.\n\n547\n00:28:21.395 --> 00:28:25.094\nBut before we do, do you have any\nadditional words that you maybe would like\n\n548\n00:28:25.094 --> 00:28:27.337\nto throw to our viewers\nas we wrap this one up?\n\n549\n00:28:27.337 --> 00:28:31.125\nI just had an idea pop into my head\nthat I really kinda wanna try PDU\n\n550\n00:28:31.125 --> 00:28:32.440\npole vaulting now.\n\n551\n00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.340\nWe got this one right here.\n\n552\n00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:34.685\nI bet I could get some height on this one.\n\n553\n00:28:34.685 --> 00:28:36.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Would you call that electrical limbo?\n\n554\n00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:37.474\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n555\n00:28:37.474 --> 00:28:39.437\n&gt;&gt; That's right..\n&gt;&gt; All right, well all the fun and\n\n556\n00:28:39.437 --> 00:28:42.010\ngames aside,\nPDU shopping is an important aspect.\n\n557\n00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:44.360\nYou do wanna make sure you understand\nthe maximum load of your servers,\n\n558\n00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.200\nwhich means read documentation.\n\n559\n00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.530\nYou gotta pull the engineering docs for\nany equipment that you've purchased to\n\n560\n00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:52.510\nmake sure you're provided the appropriate\npower and influence your decision.\n\n561\n00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:56.860\nDon't cheap out on PDUs, the cheaper\nthey are, the worst power they provide.\n\n562\n00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.560\nThe worse power your server gets,\nthe shorter the lifetime is.\n\n563\n00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:03.697\nSo it makes sense to invest in\na good power distribution system.\n\n564\n00:29:03.697 --> 00:29:05.119\n&gt;&gt; All right, words of wisdom, Don.\n\n565\n00:29:05.119 --> 00:29:08.461\nWe appreciate having you\nhere in the studio with us.\n\n566\n00:29:08.461 --> 00:29:10.720\nAnd we appreciate you\nthe viewers watching.\n\n567\n00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.490\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes

TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.850\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\nwhat do we got in store for you today?\n\n7\n00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.930\nWell more of that COMP TS Server Plus SK0\n004, if I could get that right.\n\n8\n00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And joining us in the studios\n\n9\n00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.300\ntoday is none other than Mr.\nDon Pezet, Don how you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.560\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing just well, Wes, ready to dive\nright back into environmental controls.\n\n11\n00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.090\nAnd, this is part three,\n\n12\n00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.110\nso in part one we had a chance to\ntalk a little bit about power.\n\n13\n00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.910\nWe talked about UPSs,\nmostly, power supplies.\n\n14\n00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.960\nIn part two we talked about PDUs,\nPower Distribution Units.\n\n15\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.680\nIn this episode we're going to\nswitch gears a little bit and\n\n16\n00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.130\nwe're going to talk about environment.\n\n17\n00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.780\nA little more of the atmospherics\nof a server room.\n\n18\n00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.160\nThat, power is really important,\n\n19\n00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.980\nthat’s a key aspect of keeping\nyour servers up and running.\n\n20\n00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.610\nBut, with power comes heat, right.\n\n21\n00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.000\nElectricity that’s used\ninefficiently generate heat and\n\n22\n00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.490\nservers make a lot of heat.\n\n23\n00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.400\nSo, we have to make sure that we've\ngot temperature controls or HVAC.\n\n24\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.750\nWe're going to talk about that.\n\n25\n00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.890\nAnd we have other just general safety\nprinciples that we always need to practice\n\n26\n00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.510\nwhen we're in a data center.\n\n27\n00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.940\nAnd that's all coming up\nright here in this episode.\n\n28\n00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.480\n&gt;&gt; I thought you were going to say,\nwith part three,\n\n29\n00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.154\nwe transition to the dark side.\n\n30\n00:01:20.154 --> 00:01:20.945\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that's right.\n\n31\n00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:23.660\nSo [LAUGH] when we look at safety,\nDon, what are the first things or\n\n32\n00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.110\nsome of the considerations\nthat we need to think about?\n\n33\n00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.290\nWe ended the last episode talking\nabout ESD, electrostatic discharge.\n\n34\n00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.160\nAnd how as humans, we can generate\npower surges in equipments and\n\n35\n00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.740\nwe've already covered that one.\n\n36\n00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.480\nBut there are other things like fire.\n\n37\n00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.800\nWhat if a fire breaks\nout in your data site?\n\n38\n00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.320\nWell, first off,\n\n39\n00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.540\nrule number one, there probably shouldn't\nbe wood anywhere in your data center.\n\n40\n00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.052\nMost data centers don't feature wood as\na material used in their construction.\n\n41\n00:01:52.052 --> 00:01:53.213\nIt's almost all metal.\n\n42\n00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:55.350\nMetal and electronic components.\n\n43\n00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.510\nSo, if there's a fire in your data center,\n\n44\n00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.300\nit's almost guaranteed to\nbe an electrical fire.\n\n45\n00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.160\nAnd electrical fires are special.\n\n46\n00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.409\nIf there's an electrical fire and\nyou throw water on it, what happens?\n\n47\n00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.350\nNothing, it continues to burn\nat the rate that it was burning.\n\n48\n00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.340\nIt's not as bad as a grease fire,\nyou throw water on it and\n\n49\n00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.170\nit gets worse, right.\n\n50\n00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.260\nBut an electrical fire, water is not\ntypically a great way to fight that.\n\n51\n00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.660\nUnless you've removed\nelectricity from the equation.\n\n52\n00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.020\nSo, if an electrical fire breaks\nout in your server room and\n\n53\n00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.590\nyou cut power to everything usually\nthe electrical fire will go away.\n\n54\n00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.150\nOr we can treat the fire with\nthe proper fire extinguisher.\n\n55\n00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.640\nWhen you buy a fire extinguisher\nit'll have a letter grade on it.\n\n56\n00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.300\nAn A, B, C, or D fire extinguisher.\n\n57\n00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.190\nAnd different letters\ncover different things.\n\n58\n00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.820\nYou need to make sure the fire\nextinguishers you have in your\n\n59\n00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.120\nserver's data center room are rated for\nelectrical fires.\n\n60\n00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.990\nThat is really important.\n\n61\n00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.610\nThey need to be rated for\nelectrical fires.\n\n62\n00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.870\nBut the number one thing is if a fire\nbreaks out, you need to cut electricity,\n\n63\n00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.240\nnow it's not an electrical fire anymore,\nand you can treat it however you want.\n\n64\n00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.840\nAnd the reason I mention that is that\nthe ones that treat electrical fires\n\n65\n00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.410\ndon't typically use a liquid,\nthey typically use a powder.\n\n66\n00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.138\nAnd so\nwhen you fire off that extinguisher,\n\n67\n00:03:03.138 --> 00:03:04.960\nit's a white powder that comes out.\n\n68\n00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.480\nAnd what it's doing is\nbonding to oxygen and\n\n69\n00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.260\npreventing the fire from\nbeing able to form.\n\n70\n00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.580\nWell that white powder is a mess.\n\n71\n00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.250\nAn absolute mess.\n\n72\n00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.280\nYes, it will stop the fire and\nit'll stop the fire fast.\n\n73\n00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.370\nBut what do you do after the fire?\n\n74\n00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.990\nYou spend a lot of time\nwith a vacuum cleaner.\n\n75\n00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.320\nIt takes forever.\n\n76\n00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.250\nIt gets in everything.\n\n77\n00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.880\nRemember your servers have fans,\nthey're sucking that power right in.\n\n78\n00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.570\nIt takes forever to clean up\nafter one of those things.\n\n79\n00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.750\nSo you don't want to use it\nunless you absolutely have to.\n\n80\n00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.980\n&gt;&gt; Don, why don't we do this, why don't\nwe take all the oxygen out of the room?\n\n81\n00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.740\nI know that has a tendency to kill fire.\n\n82\n00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n83\n00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.510\nIf you look at data centers from\nthe 1980s and even the early 1990s, well,\n\n84\n00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.240\nsome of the data centers I\nworked on even in the 2000s.\n\n85\n00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.490\nThat's the technique they used to follow.\n\n86\n00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.130\nNow, its not like what you're thinking,\nit's not like in space you open the air\n\n87\n00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.030\nlock and out goes the oxygen and\nout goes the fire.\n\n88\n00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.150\nThat works by the way, if you got a data\ncenter in space that's no problem,\n\n89\n00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.540\nain't cooling your data center\nis no problem in space either.\n\n90\n00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.100\nBut most of us are firmly\nplanted right here on Old Tera.\n\n91\n00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.120\nAnd as a result, we can't just vent\noxygen out, that doesn't work.\n\n92\n00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.520\nSo the solution in the past was to\nuse systems like halon systems.\n\n93\n00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.640\nSome of you've probably heard of halon.\n\n94\n00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.070\nAnd the way halon works,\nit's actually kind of scary.\n\n95\n00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.330\nI've worked in these\nenvironments several times and\n\n96\n00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.780\nthe training you have to go through\nto work in a halon environment,\n\n97\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.480\nit's terrifying because\nit's supposed to be.\n\n98\n00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.960\nThey way halon works is if\na fire breaks out, Halon gas,\n\n99\n00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.580\nit really looks like a powder,\nis entered into the room.\n\n100\n00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.070\nIt's basically sprayed into the room.\n\n101\n00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.820\nAnd what halon does is it bonds to oxygen.\n\n102\n00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.480\nAnd so it takes the oxygen\nbefore the fire can get it.\n\n103\n00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.930\nAnd it basically makes it where\nthere's no oxygen in the room,\n\n104\n00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.700\nthus stopping the fire.\n\n105\n00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.300\nOn a positive side,\nit doesn't damage the servers.\n\n106\n00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.340\nThink about sprinklers.\n\n107\n00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.810\nIf I had water sprinklers\nabove my server rack and\n\n108\n00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.410\nit goes off,\nwhat's going to happen to the servers?\n\n109\n00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.040\nThey're ruined.\n\n110\n00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.710\nYou can't get servers wet.\n\n111\n00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.390\nWell sometimes we have to add that here,\n\n112\n00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.810\nthe data servers behind us,\nwe have water sprinklers above those.\n\n113\n00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.590\nIf a fire breaks out in the room,\nwater sprinklers will go off,\n\n114\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.770\nthose servers will get doused,\nthey'll all be ruined.\n\n115\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.300\nNow for us, we have insurance.\n\n116\n00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.230\nAnd so if water douses those servers and\nthey're all ruined, insurance covers it.\n\n117\n00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.520\nWe'll buy some more,\nwe'll replace them, and it's fine.\n\n118\n00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.640\nWe're not mission critical If those\nservers go offline, nobody's going to die.\n\n119\n00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.640\nSomebody might not pass a test,\nbut they're not going to die.\n\n120\n00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.650\nIf we were a hospital though, and those\nservers go offline, somebody could die.\n\n121\n00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.150\nSo you would need a disaster recovery\ncenter somewhere else you could run from,\n\n122\n00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.146\nor a way of removing that oxygen\nthat doesn't damage the servers,\n\n123\n00:05:37.146 --> 00:05:39.740\nand is that solution, right?\n\n124\n00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.320\nWell, halon was that solution.\n\n125\n00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.500\nTwo problems with Halon, problem number\none, it's bad for the environment, okay?\n\n126\n00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.950\nIt actually attacks the ozone really,\nreally bad and so the EPA has banned it.\n\n127\n00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.880\nSo you're not allowed Halon anymore.\n\n128\n00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.610\nIn fact, the odds of any of you working\nin Halon environment is extremely slim.\n\n129\n00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.830\nYou just don't see it anymore,\nit's been banned.\n\n130\n00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.870\nThe other problem is, what happens when\nyou take the oxygen out of the air and\n\n131\n00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.430\nyou're still in there?\n\n132\n00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.750\nYou can't breathe.\n\n133\n00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.420\nSo having a Halon System,\n\n134\n00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.670\nyou actually have to have air\nmasks at various locations.\n\n135\n00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.990\nSo that any employees that are still\nin the room can go and grab a mask and\n\n136\n00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.110\nput it on so they can still breathe.\n\n137\n00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.730\nAnd that's the training that I had to go\nthrough to work in those environments,\n\n138\n00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.890\nwas that it was my responsibility\nto make sure everybody was out.\n\n139\n00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.220\nSo normally as soon as\nthe halon alarm would go off,\n\n140\n00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.830\nwhich it sounds like a stinking\ntrain engine when the things go off.\n\n141\n00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:37.560\nIt's insanely loud, and when that happens,\neveryone needs to know get the heck out.\n\n142\n00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.470\nGet out of that server room immediately\ncuz it's about to have no air.\n\n143\n00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.040\nBut there was always a safety officer.\n\n144\n00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.010\nSomebody had to be trained to grab a mask,\nchuck it on and\n\n145\n00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.220\nmake sure everybody got out.\n\n146\n00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.930\nAnd that was challenging because halon's\nother problem you couldn't see through it.\n\n147\n00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.370\nIt was a white cloud.\n\n148\n00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.410\nWhen it dispersed it was messy and\nyou couldn't see, you couldn't breathe.\n\n149\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.540\nJust really a bad situation all in all.\n\n150\n00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.100\nSo it's largely been\nreplaced by other solutions.\n\n151\n00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.750\nMost people just have DR centers now and\ndo water sprinklers.\n\n152\n00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.700\nYeah, the water sprinklers\nare gonna ruin your servers,\n\n153\n00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.640\nbut at least you can failover to DR.\n\n154\n00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.720\nIn the older days, it was harder to\nhave reliable DR because you didn't have\n\n155\n00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.830\nthe network infrastructure\nthat we have today.\n\n156\n00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.400\nBut the other solution is to use\nwhat's called a clean agent.\n\n157\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.170\nA clean agent is something that\nhas basically replaced Halon.\n\n158\n00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.290\nSo if you deploy today,\nyou're not allowed to do deploy Halon,\n\n159\n00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.295\nI think a air craft is one of the only\nexceptions was never talk in my earlier\n\n160\n00:07:28.295 --> 00:07:31.360\nbecause they discharge way up in\nthe atmosphere anyway i doesn't matter.\n\n161\n00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.920\nBut, in a server room you normally\ngoing to have something like energen\n\n162\n00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.410\nis one or FM.\n\n163\n00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:40.920\nShould FM 200, 300.\n\n164\n00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.700\nI'll ask you this one.\n\n165\n00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.410\nFM 200.\nFM 200 which is in\n\n166\n00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.730\nalternative to hell log.\n\n167\n00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.730\nAnd these are what\nare called clean agents.\n\n168\n00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.603\nClean agents are interesting because\nthey disperse into the atmosphere and\n\n169\n00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:53.216\nthey reduce the amount of\navailable oxygen right?\n\n170\n00:07:53.216 --> 00:07:56.170\nBut they do two things\nthat halon didn't do.\n\n171\n00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.450\nFirst off,\none it's clear you can see through it.\n\n172\n00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.140\nAnd you don't necessarily\nhave to clean it up.\n\n173\n00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.100\nIt gets all over the servers,\nbut that's okay.\n\n174\n00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.830\nFans will blow it out eventually,\nand it's not a big deal.\n\n175\n00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.490\nIt's clear, right?\n\n176\n00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:12.870\nAnd then second, it doesn't take\nall the oxygen out of the air.\n\n177\n00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.470\nIt takes some of the oxygen out, right?\n\n178\n00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.890\nThe normal air we breathe is\nabout 20% oxygen, roughly.\n\n179\n00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.570\nIf any of you guys are chemists and\nphysicists,\n\n180\n00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.340\nyou're probably laughing at me,\nbut it is roughly 20%.\n\n181\n00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.870\nAnd there's all sorts of other stuff\nin the air we breathe like nitrogen and\n\n182\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.850\ncarbon dioxide and\nwhatever, but roughly 20%.\n\n183\n00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.330\nFor fire to burn, it needs 15%.\n\n184\n00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.784\nFor us to survive,\nwe really only need 10%.\n\n185\n00:08:36.784 --> 00:08:43.638\nSo what FM200 tries to do is reduce\nthe oxygen to below 15% to stop fire.\n\n186\n00:08:43.638 --> 00:08:45.100\nBut above 10%, so we don't die.\n\n187\n00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:51.400\nAnd so you can actually be in the room\nwhen FM 200 disperses, and you'll survive.\n\n188\n00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.340\nIt smells pretty bad, so\nyou don't want to be in the room.\n\n189\n00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.320\nBut you can, and it's not gonna be the end\nof you, so that's a nice alternative.\n\n190\n00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.610\nAnd it doesn't damage the ozone,\nso the tree huggers are happy.\n\n191\n00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.080\nAnd everything works out, right?\n\n192\n00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.850\nThat we preserve the natural environment,\nwe preserve our own lives,\n\n193\n00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.100\nwe stop the fire in the server room.\n\n194\n00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.190\nAnd as soon as the fire's done,\n\n195\n00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.400\nthe servers that were\nunaffected continue running.\n\n196\n00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.450\nThey can run even when they're coded\nin FM 200, and they'll be fine, and\n\n197\n00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:19.510\ncontinue to work.\n\n198\n00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.560\nSo it's a great alternative.\n\n199\n00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.020\nThat's why we don't see halon anymore,\none it's banned, and\n\n200\n00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.825\ntwo, the new stuff is better.\n\n201\n00:09:24.825 --> 00:09:26.980\nBut the new stuff is harder to work with,\n\n202\n00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.820\ncuz there's a certain\nbalance they have to reach.\n\n203\n00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.080\nHow do they know that they're\ngetting oxygen down to 12%?\n\n204\n00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.920\nThey've gotta know\nthe dimensions of the room.\n\n205\n00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.490\nThey have to have the dispensers at\ncertain locations for even distribution,\n\n206\n00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.990\nand it takes a lot of work.\n\n207\n00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.051\nYou can't put these systems in yourself.\n\n208\n00:09:42.051 --> 00:09:45.445\nYou have to bring in fire control experts\nthat measure the room and the dimensions,\n\n209\n00:09:45.445 --> 00:09:48.220\nand then take all of that in account and\nplace these agents in there.\n\n210\n00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.240\nAnd then they have to be maintained.\n\n211\n00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.840\nThe odds are you're not\nhaving a fire every year.\n\n212\n00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.310\nYou'll probably go years,\nand years without a fire.\n\n213\n00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.700\nSo those dispensing nozzles just\nsit there, gathering dust and\n\n214\n00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.500\ngetting clogged up over the years.\n\n215\n00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.110\nSo, every six months they need\nto be tested and cleared.\n\n216\n00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.580\nA test discharge needs to be done, which\nis not something you wanna do yourself.\n\n217\n00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.670\nSo you gotta make sure that all\nthat stuff's being maintained, and\n\n218\n00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.410\nthat's all a part of virus suppression,\nall really important stuff there.\n\n219\n00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.360\n&gt;&gt; All right Don so we talked about\nthings like electrical safety, and\n\n220\n00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.110\nwe've also talked about\nnow fire suppression.\n\n221\n00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.500\nI know there are other things\nthat can really hurt us and\n\n222\n00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.760\nget us in trouble really quick\nif we're not paying attention.\n\n223\n00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.507\nWhat are some of those other\nthings Don that we might expect?\n\n224\n00:10:26.507 --> 00:10:29.740\n&gt;&gt; We spend so much time and\nmoney planning on fire.\n\n225\n00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.340\nAnd what are the odds\nof a fire breaking out?\n\n226\n00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.570\nIt's actually pretty low.\n\n227\n00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.220\nThere's things that are far more common\nthat can hurt you that we need to be\n\n228\n00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.350\nplanning for in any server.\n\n229\n00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:43.050\nThe most common injury in a sever\nroom is a lifting injury, right?\n\n230\n00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.170\nServers are heavy.\n\n231\n00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.155\nAnd racks are tall.\n\n232\n00:10:45.155 --> 00:10:48.850\nIf you have a 42 year rack and you need\nto get a server in the top of the rack.\n\n233\n00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:53.200\nYou're having to lift a heavy server\nabove your head and get it in there.\n\n234\n00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.020\nSo lifting injuries are the most\ncommon injury found in a server room.\n\n235\n00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.950\nIt's a common occurrence.\n\n236\n00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:04.270\nSo in a data center, you need to make\nsure you follow lifting procedures,\n\n237\n00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.070\nthat you wear a brace if you need to.\n\n238\n00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.610\nLifting braces are very inexpensive and\nactually, very effective.\n\n239\n00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.690\nEverything is a team lift.\n\n240\n00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.330\nAny time you put a server in, even a\none-use server, it should be a team lift.\n\n241\n00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.659\nI know you're thinking, hey,\nDon, it's a 40 pound server and\n\n242\n00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:21.515\nI can lift 40 pounds like nothing.\n\n243\n00:11:21.515 --> 00:11:23.230\nWell, I'm sure you can.\n\n244\n00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:27.810\nBut you're lifting 40 pounds above\nyour head in some cases, and having to\n\n245\n00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:32.040\npush vertically to insert it into, or\nhorizontally, to insert it into a rack.\n\n246\n00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.540\nThose are odd motions.\n\n247\n00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.070\nThis is not like a dead lift at the gym.\n\n248\n00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.680\nThis is a strange motion.\n\n249\n00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.180\nIt is very easy to pull a muscle or\nstrain a muscle, and injure yourself.\n\n250\n00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.679\nAnd you don't wanna do that, right?\n\n251\n00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:46.760\nThat's why we get into IT,\nwe don't wanna sweat and hurt ourselves.\n\n252\n00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.548\nWe wannna do easy office work.\n\n253\n00:11:48.548 --> 00:11:51.297\nSo we wanna make sure we\nfollow proper precautions, and\n\n254\n00:11:51.297 --> 00:11:52.767\ndo a team lift when possible.\n\n255\n00:11:52.767 --> 00:11:55.850\nAnd the whole lift with your legs,\nnot with you back rule.\n\n256\n00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:59.320\nAll of this stuff that you're used to,\nthat applies in the server room also.\n\n257\n00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.880\n&gt;&gt; You know, Don, with these server\nracks being six feet tall there,\n\n258\n00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.750\nI can only imagine that you've got so\nmuch weight in there.\n\n259\n00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.310\nMy first thought would be,\nand we've talked about this,\n\n260\n00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.235\nis should I put the heavy\nequipment at the top of the rack?\n\n261\n00:12:12.235 --> 00:12:15.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, it is funny,\nit depends on who you ask, right?\n\n262\n00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.280\nBecause,if you're talking to the CIO,\nthey want the data center to look nice.\n\n263\n00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.370\nAnd when you want a data\ncenter to look nice,\n\n264\n00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:25.680\nyou put all the stuff with blinking\nlights at the top of the rack.\n\n265\n00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.290\nBut that creates rack instability,\nracks can tip.\n\n266\n00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:32.030\nAnd if a rack tips and falls, you die.\n\n267\n00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.720\nIt's a lot of weight, it comes down like a\nhammer, and you don't survive that, right?\n\n268\n00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.975\nIt's very, very dangerous.\n\n269\n00:12:36.975 --> 00:12:41.200\nSo racks should always be\nloaded from the bottom, up.\n\n270\n00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.590\nAnd if you've got heavy equipment,\nthat should be in the absolute bottom.\n\n271\n00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:47.740\nSo SANs, SANs have a ton of hard drives\nin them, and hard drives are heavy.\n\n272\n00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.300\nThose should be in the bottom of the rack.\n\n273\n00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.027\nUPSs, if you've got rack mount UPSs,\nthose absolutely should be on the bottom,\n\n274\n00:12:52.027 --> 00:12:54.370\ncuz the batteries are the heaviest\nthing in your data center, right?\n\n275\n00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.330\nSo all of that needs to be at the bottom,\nand you build up towards the top.\n\n276\n00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.860\nIt doesn't look as pretty\nwhen you do that, but\n\n277\n00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.600\nthat's the way you need to do it.\n\n278\n00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.030\nAnd racks should be secured\nto the floor anyway.\n\n279\n00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.900\nSo that they can't tip even\nif you load it incorrectly.\n\n280\n00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.688\nAnd I think I've talked about\nthis in another episode, but\n\n281\n00:13:10.688 --> 00:13:14.143\nwhen you're working on a serving rack,\nyou need to slide it out on rails,\n\n282\n00:13:14.143 --> 00:13:16.130\nand that creates a lot of forward weight.\n\n283\n00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:20.171\nAnd if it's up high, and you're sliding it\nout, that makes it that much easier for\n\n284\n00:13:20.171 --> 00:13:21.370\nthe whole rack to tip.\n\n285\n00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.760\nSo if you're going to be working on\na server you might need to take it\n\n286\n00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.920\ncompletely out of the racks, so you can\ntake it to a workbench to work on it.\n\n287\n00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.110\nThe racks definitely can tip and\nthat is a bad situation.\n\n288\n00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:35.300\n&gt;&gt; You know Don, I look in our sever\ncloset behind us and I see four racks,\n\n289\n00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.470\nfive racks, I believe.\n\n290\n00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.060\nNow this is a concern that I\nwouldn't even think about.\n\n291\n00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.960\nWhat if I have a hundred of those racks?\n\n292\n00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.010\nWhat if I had 200 of those racks?\n\n293\n00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.496\nNow there are other concerns that we have\nto start instructional concerns that we\n\n294\n00:13:47.496 --> 00:13:49.405\nhave to start taking into account, right?\n\n295\n00:13:49.405 --> 00:13:52.006\n&gt;&gt; Right, and here in this building,\nwe're actually,\n\n296\n00:13:52.006 --> 00:13:53.823\nwe're right on a cement foundation.\n\n297\n00:13:53.823 --> 00:13:57.200\nAnd so we don't have to worry\nabout which called floor load.\n\n298\n00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.330\nFloor load is the maximum weight\nthat your floor can support.\n\n299\n00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.920\nBut, I used to work at an organization\nthat was in a skyscraper.\n\n300\n00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:08.108\nSo we had a data center that was\non the 19th floor of a skyscraper.\n\n301\n00:14:08.108 --> 00:14:11.570\nIt was a 65 story building,\nwe were on the 19th floor.\n\n302\n00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:15.910\nAnd, we had been told by the building\nsupervisor that we were at floor load.\n\n303\n00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.180\nWe were at maximum floor load.\n\n304\n00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:22.900\nWe had it was like 270 servers in 20,\nor 30 racks or something like that.\n\n305\n00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.580\nBut we're at the maximum floor load.\n\n306\n00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.800\nAnd so, any time we brought a new server\nin, we had to take an old server out.\n\n307\n00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.580\nAnd we had to weigh them to make sure\nthat the old server weighed the same or\n\n308\n00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.650\nmore than the new server.\n\n309\n00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:34.870\nWe couldn't bring new equipment in.\n\n310\n00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:38.060\nBecause what would happen is\nif you overload the floor,\n\n311\n00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.330\nall of a sudden the 19th\nfloor becomes the 18th floor.\n\n312\n00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.680\nYou drop through the floor.\n\n313\n00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.740\nAnd once structural integrity is broken\nlike that, you usually continue to drop.\n\n314\n00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.310\nSo you'll go down a couple of floors.\n\n315\n00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:50.950\nAnd a lot of people will\nget significantly hurt.\n\n316\n00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.760\nNow, that's where technologies like\nvirtualization and Cloud really come in.\n\n317\n00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.800\nWhen we started implementing VMWare there,\n\n318\n00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.650\nwe were able to cut those 270 physical\nservers down to a hair over a hundred\n\n319\n00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.880\nphysical servers that are running VMs for\nus.\n\n320\n00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.440\nAnd then we were way under floor load,\nright.\n\n321\n00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.350\nBut the floor load is something you\ndefinitely need to keep in mind\n\n322\n00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.946\nin a multi storied building when\nyou're not on the ground floor.\n\n323\n00:15:11.946 --> 00:15:14.140\nMost organizations these days\nhave wisened up to that,\n\n324\n00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.580\nand their data centers\nare on the ground floor.\n\n325\n00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.450\nBut, there's plenty out\nthere in skyscrapers that\n\n326\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.250\nhave elevated data centers and\nyou got floor load.\n\n327\n00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.190\nMany people use subfloor, right?\n\n328\n00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.700\nThis building actually used to\nhave subfloor before we filled it\n\n329\n00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:27.255\nin with concrete.\n\n330\n00:15:27.255 --> 00:15:31.790\n[LAUGH] And with that subfloor, you might\nhave a two foot gap between the floor and\n\n331\n00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.180\nthe foundation underneath.\n\n332\n00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.490\nAnd your subfloor will\nhave a weight rating,\n\n333\n00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.470\nthen you don't want your\nserver racks to exceed that.\n\n334\n00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.480\nSo you might have a 42 year rack,\nbut you can only fill it half way,\n\n335\n00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.750\nbecause the SAN you put in\nthere is too heavy, right?\n\n336\n00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.110\nThat happens, you can't always get\nfull utilization out of a rack.\n\n337\n00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:47.029\nSo definitely keep that in mind.\n\n338\n00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.880\nFloor load is a big part.\n\n339\n00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.502\nOther things, other little injuries\nwe can have are things like what\n\n340\n00:15:54.502 --> 00:15:56.930\ncalls our pinch points and sharp edges.\n\n341\n00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:00.020\nServers, I've mentioned this in\nthe server component episode.\n\n342\n00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.786\nThey don't spend a lot of the time\npolishing the edges on a server.\n\n343\n00:16:02.786 --> 00:16:05.084\nThe metal inside of them\nis usually very sharp, and\n\n344\n00:16:05.084 --> 00:16:08.650\nthat's why you'll typically wear\ngloves when you work on a server.\n\n345\n00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.720\nBecause you can cut yourself really easy.\n\n346\n00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.690\nPinch points,\nthe rack doors that swing open.\n\n347\n00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.060\nIf you have your finger on one of\nthose joints and the door opens,\n\n348\n00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.740\nit's going to crush your finger.\n\n349\n00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.890\nAnd it's not normally gonna break a bone\nor anything, but it hurts like heck.\n\n350\n00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.010\nAnd you don't want that to happen.\n\n351\n00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.043\nIt's like slamming your hand in the door.\n\n352\n00:16:23.043 --> 00:16:24.870\nYou don't wanna do that.\n\n353\n00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.450\nSubfloor is the same way.\n\n354\n00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:29.860\nSubfloor normally has fairly sharp edges,\nand it's heavy.\n\n355\n00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.010\nSo if you drop it on your hand or\nsomething, it's going to hurt.\n\n356\n00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:34.297\nThese are things that we\nneed to watch out for.\n\n357\n00:16:34.297 --> 00:16:37.940\nThey know that we're not gonna spend\nevery single day in the server room.\n\n358\n00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.518\nThat we're gonna stick the equipment and\nthen walk away.\n\n359\n00:16:39.518 --> 00:16:42.330\nThat's why they don't spend a lot\nof time polishing the edges.\n\n360\n00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:43.390\nLike they would on a laptop,\n\n361\n00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.610\nthat they know you're gonna\nbe touching every single day.\n\n362\n00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.620\nThey're nice and polished edges,\nbut not on a server.\n\n363\n00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.040\nSo always be aware of those\nthings in our server room.\n\n364\n00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:52.910\n&gt;&gt; Don we've been talking.\n\n365\n00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:57.230\nWe're in the part three here now\non environmental controls, right?\n\n366\n00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:00.120\nSo there are other controls\nthat we need to consider\n\n367\n00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.590\ninside of our server closets that\nare essentially a necessity, right?\n\n368\n00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:09.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the last one that we need to\ntalk about is H, V, A, C, HVAC, right.\n\n369\n00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:11.650\nWhich is heating, ventilation,\nand air conditioning.\n\n370\n00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.210\nWhen you have a data center set up.\n\n371\n00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:16.360\nYou've got servers, and\n\n372\n00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.600\nthey have a certain temperature\nrange they can operate in.\n\n373\n00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.270\nAnd if you pull up the engineering\ndocumentation for your hardware.\n\n374\n00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:27.850\nIt'll tell you, it needs to be\nabove 40 degrees Fahrenheit, and\n\n375\n00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:30.150\nbelow a 110 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n376\n00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:36.070\nOr above 10 degrees Celsius, and\n28 degrees Celsius, or whatever it is.\n\n377\n00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:38.340\nI don't think you say\ndegrees when you say Celsius.\n\n378\n00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.740\nBut anyhow, so it will tell you\nthe operating range of that equipment.\n\n379\n00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.330\nThe equipment will operate fine as\nlong as it's in those thresholds.\n\n380\n00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.790\nIf it gets outside of those thresholds,\n\n381\n00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:51.300\nif it gets too hot or too cold,\nit'll usually still run fine for awhile.\n\n382\n00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.750\nBut the lifetime will shorten,\n\n383\n00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.560\nthe equipment will fail\nsooner than you expect.\n\n384\n00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.850\nAnd, if it gets too hot or\n\n385\n00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:01.900\ntoo cold, the systems typically lock\nup and stop functioning, right.\n\n386\n00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.210\nSo that's a problem.\n\n387\n00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.190\nWe need to make sure that\nthe temperatures are maintained.\n\n388\n00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.970\nMost people keep their data\ncenters at 65 degrees.\n\n389\n00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:10.105\nThat's kind of an industry standard.\n\n390\n00:18:10.105 --> 00:18:13.127\nYou'll see people at 65 degrees cuz,\nit's very cool and\n\n391\n00:18:13.127 --> 00:18:15.490\nit keeps everything running nice and\nsmooth.\n\n392\n00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:19.550\nAnd it's right in the middle of what\nmost operating ranges are set at.\n\n393\n00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.310\nFor us as humans can be a little cold.\n\n394\n00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.467\nThat's why if you look at\npictures of data centers,\n\n395\n00:18:23.467 --> 00:18:26.720\nyou almost always see people\nin long sleeves or in jackets.\n\n396\n00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.040\nIt might be in Florida, and\nit's 110 degrees outside, but\n\n397\n00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.840\nyou're wearing your jacket at work,\nbecause the data center is cold.\n\n398\n00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.809\nThat's pretty common.\n\n399\n00:18:34.809 --> 00:18:36.618\nIt might be cold to you, but\n\n400\n00:18:36.618 --> 00:18:40.515\nremember that cold air is\ngetting sucked into the server.\n\n401\n00:18:40.515 --> 00:18:44.280\nAd the server has CPU, RAM,\n\n402\n00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.480\nhard drives that are all generating heat,\npower supply generating heat.\n\n403\n00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.880\nAnd that cool air,\nhas to bring their temperature down.\n\n404\n00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:55.780\nSo it's gotta be cold to draw off that\nheat, and then push it through the server.\n\n405\n00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:59.240\nSo air conditioning in a data\ncenter is normally pretty extreme.\n\n406\n00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:03.750\nYou've got some large quantity vents\nthat are moving a huge volume of air and\n\n407\n00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.520\nkeeping it a little on the cold side.\n\n408\n00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.430\nSo you might say, 65, I prefer 75.\n\n409\n00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.032\nLet's go ahead and set it to 75.\n\n410\n00:19:10.032 --> 00:19:13.180\nWell, you can get the room\nat 75 if you want, but\n\n411\n00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.040\ninside the servers it's gonna be 100, 110.\n\n412\n00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.490\nIf it was at 65, inside of the servers\nit would be 90 or a hundred degrees.\n\n413\n00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.880\nIt would be a little more reasonable.\n\n414\n00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.760\nSo you always want it to be nice and\ncool in that data center.\n\n415\n00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.920\nSo let's talk about how\nthat cooling works.\n\n416\n00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:33.000\nI whipped up a Vizio diagram here to kind\nof show a top down view of a data center.\n\n417\n00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.770\nI've got four rows of\nracks in this data center.\n\n418\n00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.561\nSo this is the top of a Dell 4220 rack,\nand\n\n419\n00:19:38.561 --> 00:19:41.210\nwhen you look at the top\nof rack of a server.\n\n420\n00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.780\nLet me kind of zoom in on one of these.\n\n421\n00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.090\nWhen you look at the top of a rack,\nthere's usually vents right on the top,\n\n422\n00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:48.100\nlittle grading area.\n\n423\n00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.000\nAnd these two holes are your cables.\n\n424\n00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.120\nThey're suppose to run down\nfrom the ceiling down into it.\n\n425\n00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.880\nMost of the time the cables\ncome up from the floor,\n\n426\n00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.060\nbut they can come down from the ceiling.\n\n427\n00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.380\nThat's what those holes are for.\n\n428\n00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:00.360\nBut these are just vents,\nbecause heat rises, right?\n\n429\n00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.310\nHeat goes up, cool goes down.\n\n430\n00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.690\nThat's the meteorologist principle,\nwhen you see cold fronts and\n\n431\n00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.210\nthings like that in weather.\n\n432\n00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:09.440\nThe same thing as in your server room,\nheat goes up.\n\n433\n00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.390\nAnd your servers generate heat,\nand the heat goes up.\n\n434\n00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:15.190\nThe problem is when I have a rack,\n\n435\n00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.330\nthe servers are all stacked\non top of each other.\n\n436\n00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:21.930\nSo if the heat goes up, the server at the\nbottom of the rack will be the coolest.\n\n437\n00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.070\nAnd then its heat will would go into the\nsecond server, which is gonna be warmer.\n\n438\n00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.347\nAnd then the third server\nwhich is even warmer.\n\n439\n00:20:26.347 --> 00:20:30.390\nBy the time you get all the way up\nto the top, the server's really hot.\n\n440\n00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:33.540\nAnd they're gonna go into thermal\nshut down, and lock down.\n\n441\n00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.470\nSo these vents, you don't wanna use them.\n\n442\n00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:42.180\nServers are designed to suck air in from\nthe front, and blow air out the back.\n\n443\n00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.010\nSo when you walk into a data center,\n\n444\n00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:48.120\nwhat you're normally going to see\nare two different types of floor tile.\n\n445\n00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.930\nOne type that's solid, like this one.\n\n446\n00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.370\nIt's just a solid square of metal.\n\n447\n00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:57.320\nAnd then another type that looks like\nthis, that is a perforated square.\n\n448\n00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.970\nIt will be a square with\na bunch of holes in it.\n\n449\n00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.580\nAnd those holes are effectively\nair conditioning vent.\n\n450\n00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.830\nYou've got air conditioning\nvents in the ground.\n\n451\n00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:10.590\nBecause hot air goes up,\ncold air sits down on the bottom.\n\n452\n00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.710\nSo we're pumping cold\nair in from the bottom.\n\n453\n00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:17.040\nAnd the hot air goes up, and if you\nlook at the ceiling in that data center,\n\n454\n00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.350\nyou'll see vents like these in the ceiling\nthat are taking the hot air out.\n\n455\n00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:25.340\nAnd as that hot air leaves, it's being\nreplaced by the cool air coming up from\n\n456\n00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.520\nthe ground, and\nit's cooling the data center.\n\n457\n00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.840\nSo in data centers,\ncool air comes from the ground,\n\n458\n00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.590\nhot air exits through the ceiling.\n\n459\n00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.082\nAll right, but there is a little\nmore involvement than that, but\n\n460\n00:21:36.082 --> 00:21:38.367\nthat's the basic principle to\nhow a data center is cooled.\n\n461\n00:21:38.367 --> 00:21:41.540\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, so\nwe've got all of this cool air rising.\n\n462\n00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.800\nAnd I know that you've showed us as\nyou've broken these servers open.\n\n463\n00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.290\nThey try to channel\nthe air with heat shrouds.\n\n464\n00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.540\nIs there a way on maybe\neven a larger scale,\n\n465\n00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.460\nthat we can do that inside\nof the data center?\n\n466\n00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.890\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and it's just taking\nadvantage of that technology.\n\n467\n00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.130\nInside of your server\nyou have air shrouds and\n\n468\n00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.800\nbaffles that are making sure the air\nmoves in a certain direction.\n\n469\n00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.590\nServers suck in air from the front and\nthey blow air out the back.\n\n470\n00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:07.420\nSo when we rack our servers up,\nall the fronts face the same direction and\n\n471\n00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.350\nall the backs face, well,\nthe opposite direction.\n\n472\n00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.830\nCuz that's how front and back works.\n\n473\n00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.710\nAnd so when they get racked up,\n\n474\n00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.720\nall of my servers are sucking\nair from one side of the rack.\n\n475\n00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.602\nAnd so, when you build out a data center,\nyou have what are called the hot and\n\n476\n00:22:21.602 --> 00:22:22.453\ncool isles.\n\n477\n00:22:22.453 --> 00:22:25.610\nEach isle is a different temperature.\n\n478\n00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:28.190\nAnd let me show you in a diagram,\nso I can show you what this means.\n\n479\n00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.188\nThat, when I talked\nabout those floor vents,\n\n480\n00:22:30.188 --> 00:22:33.050\nthe floor vents are in every other isle.\n\n481\n00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.120\nSo, see I've got floor\nvents here on the left.\n\n482\n00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.910\nNo floor vents here.\n\n483\n00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.580\nFloor vents in the next aisle,\nno floor vents here.\n\n484\n00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.530\nEvery other aisle is a cool aisle,\ncool air coming up.\n\n485\n00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.310\nIn the aisles that don't have cool air,\n\n486\n00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.920\nthere's the ones that\nhave the ceiling vents.\n\n487\n00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.210\nThese are the hot aisles.\n\n488\n00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.860\nThe hot air rises in that aisle, and\n\n489\n00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:58.640\ngoes into the air vents up above that\ntakes the hot air out of the building.\n\n490\n00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.200\nOkay, so I go cool aisle to hot aisle,\nto cool aisle, to hot aisle.\n\n491\n00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.860\nAnd when I place the racks,\n\n492\n00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.060\nyou probably noticed these racks\nare facing in different directions.\n\n493\n00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.420\nThese are face to face.\n\n494\n00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.515\nAnd over here Here, they're back to back.\n\n495\n00:23:13.555 --> 00:23:16.585\nWe go face to face,\nbecause this is a cool isle.\n\n496\n00:23:16.585 --> 00:23:20.175\nThe face of these servers\nshould be sucking in cool air.\n\n497\n00:23:20.175 --> 00:23:22.795\nAnd the face of these other servers\nshould also be sucking in cool air.\n\n498\n00:23:22.795 --> 00:23:26.860\nAnd they can do that because the cool\nair is coming right out of the ground.\n\n499\n00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.420\nAnd going right into the face\nplates of those servers.\n\n500\n00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.900\nThat's a cool aisle.\n\n501\n00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:35.638\nThey're both getting a nice fresh supply\nof cool air going right into those\n\n502\n00:23:35.638 --> 00:23:36.547\nface plates.\n\n503\n00:23:36.547 --> 00:23:40.450\nAnd they take that cool air and\nthey run it over their hard drives.\n\n504\n00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:45.250\nOver their CPU, over their memory,\nthrough their power supply and\n\n505\n00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:50.070\nthat cool air ejects out\nthe back as hot air now.\n\n506\n00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.680\nIt's been heated.\n\n507\n00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.710\nAnd if you look the next rack is\nfacing the opposite direction, so\n\n508\n00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:59.050\nit's ejecting its hot\nair in the same manner.\n\n509\n00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:01.270\nHot air to hot air.\n\n510\n00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:04.056\nAnd that's where the exit vent is,\nso that hot air raises up,\n\n511\n00:24:04.056 --> 00:24:06.630\nhits the exit vent and\nleaves the building.\n\n512\n00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:10.520\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, let's say maybe I haven't\ndone my planning in my data center so\n\n513\n00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.260\nwell and I've got a couple of racks\nin there that aren't fully populated.\n\n514\n00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.970\nIt looks like there were\nspace in between there,\n\n515\n00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:20.900\nthis system right here would be kind\nof degraded in its performance.\n\n516\n00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.450\nAre there things that we can do on the\nrack itself if they're not fully populated\n\n517\n00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:27.800\nto help maybe even this system,\nor an internal system?\n\n518\n00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you really shouldn't have\nblank space in a server rack.\n\n519\n00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.300\nSo if I have 42U rack and\n\n520\n00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.960\nI've only got 12U of servers in there,\nwhat about the other 30U?\n\n521\n00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.520\nI've got 30U of empty space.\n\n522\n00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.080\nWell that empty space is space that air\ncan move around in a different pattern.\n\n523\n00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:47.310\nSo for example, I could have hot air that\nis exiting the back of the rack, but\n\n524\n00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:50.300\njust leaks back and\ncomes back into the cool aisle or\n\n525\n00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.350\npotentially get suck back in by\nthe phase played by that server.\n\n526\n00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.698\nThat's a problem, and so\nwhen you have a rack with empty space,\n\n527\n00:24:56.698 --> 00:24:59.251\nyou need to put what you\ncall blanking panels in.\n\n528\n00:24:59.251 --> 00:25:02.977\nBlanking panels are just metal\nrectangles that bolt right on and\n\n529\n00:25:02.977 --> 00:25:06.229\nyou can get them in one U two,\nU three, U four, U sizes.\n\n530\n00:25:06.229 --> 00:25:09.562\nNormally, you just by one and two U, cuz\nthen you can kinda piece them together and\n\n531\n00:25:09.562 --> 00:25:13.290\nmeet whatever you need, and fill up\nthe gaps that you have inside of the rack.\n\n532\n00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:17.030\nBy putting that paneling in place,\nit stops hot air\n\n533\n00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.210\nfrom reintroducing itself to the face\nplates, to the front of the servers.\n\n534\n00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.460\nIt creates a wall on\nthe front of the rack.\n\n535\n00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.720\nAnd you're gonna need those.\n\n536\n00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.090\nYou should probably have just a supply of\nthem handy, because as you add servers,\n\n537\n00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.050\nyou'll take blanking panels out.\n\n538\n00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:33.050\nAnd then as you remove servers, you'll put\nblanking panels in to fill the gaps, and\n\n539\n00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.190\nthat controls that air flow.\n\n540\n00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:38.430\nIf you make a mistake in\nhow this stuff is arranged.\n\n541\n00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.170\nIf you have a server rack for\n\n542\n00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:45.590\nexample that is put in backwards,\nthen you're gonna bump into a situation.\n\n543\n00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:48.000\nWell, that's totally not\nwhat I was trying to do, but\n\n544\n00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.370\nyou can bump into a situation where it\nis moving air in the wrong direction.\n\n545\n00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:57.990\nAnd now we have where\nwe've got a hot aisle, and\n\n546\n00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:04.830\nthat hot air is unfortunately gonna end\nup going right into the face plates.\n\n547\n00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:09.780\nAnd so that server is now taking in\nthat hot air and spitting hot air out\n\n548\n00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.780\ninto the cold aisle where other\nthings are expecting to have it.\n\n549\n00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:13.810\nThat's a problem, right?\n\n550\n00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.370\nWe've gotta think about that air flow and\nhow this is gonna\n\n551\n00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.780\nresult inside of my data center and\nmake sure that we're stopping it.\n\n552\n00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.820\nYou never want hot air to enter\ninto a cold aisle because\n\n553\n00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:28.470\nyou feed hot air into a system and you're\ngonna start having thermal shutdowns and\n\n554\n00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:29.910\nother inconsistencies.\n\n555\n00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:33.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Don, you've mentioned how\nimportant this cooling system is and\n\n556\n00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:36.430\nI can only imagine that we don't want\nto be guessing at something like that\n\n557\n00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:39.950\nwhen it’s so detrimental or\nimportant to our environment.\n\n558\n00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.420\nHow can we take the guess work out and\n\n559\n00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.850\nmake sure that our HVAC\nsystem is working correctly?\n\n560\n00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:47.130\n&gt;&gt; A lot of servers will do their own\nmonitoring and they can email you and\n\n561\n00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:49.640\nnotify you, but usually by the time\nthe server notices a problem,\n\n562\n00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.090\nit’s too late, right?\n\n563\n00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.920\nSo we're typically gonna\nleverage a combination of\n\n564\n00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.040\nmanual monitoring where somebody is\nactually going into the rooms and\n\n565\n00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.658\nchecking the systems and\nautomated monitoring.\n\n566\n00:27:00.658 --> 00:27:03.193\nThere's plenty of organizations out there,\n\n567\n00:27:03.193 --> 00:27:06.965\ncompanies like APC that make\nenvironmental monitoring equipment.\n\n568\n00:27:06.965 --> 00:27:07.590\nI like open gear,\n\n569\n00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:09.979\nit's another one let me show you\nsome of their stuff that they make.\n\n570\n00:27:09.979 --> 00:27:11.744\nThey make these little sensors,\n\n571\n00:27:11.744 --> 00:27:16.010\nthese little kinda tan boxes that you\ncan wire up through your building.\n\n572\n00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:20.620\nAnd if you look, you'll see where it's got\na couple of connectors and a network jack.\n\n573\n00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.740\nAnd so it can monitor for\nthings like temperature, humidity, and\n\n574\n00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:28.780\nother things in the atmosphere,\nand report it back to you.\n\n575\n00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:32.030\nAnd more importantly,\nyou can log this and monitor for trends.\n\n576\n00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.820\nSo you can see if the temperature\nis slowly increasing or\n\n577\n00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.010\nif it's decreasing,\nif I'm having spikes at certain times.\n\n578\n00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:42.030\nYou can track a lot of that and\ncommunicate it back to central locations.\n\n579\n00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:45.091\nAnd they have bigger appliance solutions\ntoo, they have all sorts of stuff.\n\n580\n00:27:45.091 --> 00:27:48.515\nEven smoke detectors and alarms,\nthese are all different things we can use\n\n581\n00:27:48.515 --> 00:27:51.210\nto monitor so\nthat we don't actually have to be there.\n\n582\n00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:54.090\nThat this could be a DR center on the\nother side of the country that I've never\n\n583\n00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:55.330\neven set foot in.\n\n584\n00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:59.630\nBut I know at a moment's glance exactly\nwhat the status is in that data center.\n\n585\n00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.090\n&gt;&gt; Don,\nthe other thing I might ask you, and\n\n586\n00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:05.650\nthis one is you've mentioned that\nthe PDUs have remote management.\n\n587\n00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:08.600\nYou can turn a port on,\nor an outlet on or off.\n\n588\n00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:13.010\nIs there any kind of way that we can,\nshort of putting up an entire SCADA\n\n589\n00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:16.650\nsystem, that we can actually control\nthis from a remote location, or\n\n590\n00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.790\nis it more just going to\nbe about the monitoring?\n\n591\n00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:19.850\nSo yes and no.\n\n592\n00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:23.020\nYes, a lot of these can be remotely\ncontrolled, at the expensive ones.\n\n593\n00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.340\nIf you do the cheap ones,\nthey can't, right?\n\n594\n00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.310\nAir conditioning units, you expect to\nhave a thermostat you manually adjust.\n\n595\n00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:30.240\nBut there's plenty of remote control\nthermostats that are available.\n\n596\n00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.540\nBe very, very careful, because now, you're\n\n597\n00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:37.110\nbringing what would typically be offline\nequipment into an online environment.\n\n598\n00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.720\nIf a hacker were to get into your system,\nthey could turn off the AC.\n\n599\n00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.920\nThat would be fun, wouldn't it, right?\n\n600\n00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.780\nOr they could override your\ntemperature controls so\n\n601\n00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.500\nyou don't know that there's a problem.\n\n602\n00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:50.530\nYou need to have a dedicated management\nnetwork, a network that is solely used for\n\n603\n00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:54.290\nyour environmental controls that is\nseparate from your data network.\n\n604\n00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:57.280\nAnd I mean separate, separate switches,\nseparate everything.\n\n605\n00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.480\nNot even VLANs, right?\n\n606\n00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.760\nWe want this to be an isolated network\nthat is not connected to the internet.\n\n607\n00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.030\nI am shocked at the amount of,\n\n608\n00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:09.670\nyou mentioned SCADA systems,\nthe amount of just industrial\n\n609\n00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:12.530\ncomputers that are connected to the\ninternet when they shouldn't have been.\n\n610\n00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.270\nAnd what's happening is there's a company,\nwe assume that these\n\n611\n00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:19.260\nindustrial manufacturers take\nthe precautions to secure their equipment.\n\n612\n00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:23.030\nAnd they assume that you're taking the\nprecautions to protect the equipment and\n\n613\n00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:26.570\nwhat happens is nobody protects it,\nand you end up in a really bad spot.\n\n614\n00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:30.910\nSo a completely isolated\nenvironmental management network\n\n615\n00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:33.610\nis really essential if\nyou're going to do that.\n\n616\n00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:34.660\nMost organizations don't.\n\n617\n00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.278\nThey just have somebody go and\nmanually check.\n\n618\n00:29:36.278 --> 00:29:40.134\nLet's go check the temperature, let's go\nsee and report or they'll have monitors\n\n619\n00:29:40.134 --> 00:29:43.515\nlike these open gear ones that don't\nactually control the temperature.\n\n620\n00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:47.480\nThey can report on it, and yes that's on\nmy network, fine they can report on it.\n\n621\n00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.080\nBut they're not actually\nable to control it.\n\n622\n00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.880\nI would have to go in and\nmanually adjust that air conditioning.\n\n623\n00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.470\nSo you gotta pick and choose.\n\n624\n00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.130\nSecurity is important though.\n\n625\n00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:59.162\nDon't open yourself up to having somebody\nattack your environmental systems.\n\n626\n00:29:59.162 --> 00:30:02.243\n&gt;&gt; All right Don,\nwell we see a lot of things to consider\n\n627\n00:30:02.243 --> 00:30:05.054\nhere when it comes to\nenvironmental controls.\n\n628\n00:30:05.054 --> 00:30:08.460\nBut it does look like we're coming to the\nend of another episode, but before we do,\n\n629\n00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.496\ndo you have any additional words that\nyou might like to tell the audience?\n\n630\n00:30:11.496 --> 00:30:15.040\n&gt;&gt; A lot of this stuff falls under\nthe realm of security, right?\n\n631\n00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.320\nWe think of it as infrastructure or\nmaintenance, facilities.\n\n632\n00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.610\nBut it's security.\n\n633\n00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:23.190\nIf one of these systems fails,\nour servers go offline.\n\n634\n00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:24.500\nIf we have an outage or\n\n635\n00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.370\nremember the security is trying\nto provide three things.\n\n636\n00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:31.000\nWe have, I'm trying to remember,\nthe CIA tri-pod.\n\n637\n00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.420\nConfidentiality, Integrity,\nand availability, right?\n\n638\n00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.470\nHaving an air conditioning doesn't\nprovide me confidentiality.\n\n639\n00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.020\nIt doesn't provide the integrity.\n\n640\n00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.760\nIt provides availability.\n\n641\n00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.560\nAnd that falls under\nthe security umbrella.\n\n642\n00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.140\nSo coordinate this with your\nCISO if you have one or\n\n643\n00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:50.180\nyour two security officer if you\nhave an IT security department.\n\n644\n00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.310\nThey need to be involved\nin this process too.\n\n645\n00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:55.100\nAnd they're the one's who\nare particularly gonna be maintaining and\n\n646\n00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.140\nmonitoring the environmental systems\nto make sure it all falls under\n\n647\n00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:03.540\nthe right maintenance levels and so on.\n\n648\n00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:07.820\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, well we appreciate you\njoining us and lending us your expertise.\n\n649\n00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.180\nAnd we appreciate you,\nthe viewer watching.\n\n650\n00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.350\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign out here for ITProTV.\n\n651\n00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:14.390\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n652\n00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:15.070\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n653\n00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:16.132\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time\n\n654\n00:31:20.961 --> 00:31:24.049\n[MUSIC]\n\n655\n00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:26.070\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.264\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.264 --> 00:00:15.946\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another exciting episode\nhere at ITPROTV, I'm your host Wes Bryan\n\n5\n00:00:15.946 --> 00:00:18.920\nand in today's episode we've got\na real fun one coming at you.\n\n6\n00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.170\nThat's Server Plus and\n\n7\n00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.290\njoining us in the studios today,\nis none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.570\nDon, how are you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.370\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great Wes, ready to dive\nright back into the world of servers.\n\n10\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.920\nAnd in this episode we're gonna take a\nlook at the networking aspects of setting\n\n11\n00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.780\nup a new server.\n\n12\n00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.170\nAnd a big part of that is IP addressing.\n\n13\n00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.610\nAnd then just setting up an address for\nthe server in general so\n\n14\n00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.730\nthat we can talk to other systems\nout there on the network.\n\n15\n00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.920\nIt is a rare,\n\n16\n00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.390\nrare server that we set up that's not\nconnected to a network these days.\n\n17\n00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.260\nThere are going to be those situations,\nlike a certificate authority, the root\n\n18\n00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.950\nCA that you want to be air-gapped, you\nwant it to be separate from the network.\n\n19\n00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.220\nBut pretty much everything else\nis going to be plugged in there.\n\n20\n00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.790\nSo we're going to run\nthrough those settings.\n\n21\n00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.210\nFor most of you, you've already\nbeen through network plus or\n\n22\n00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.700\ncertifications like that, or\nyou've got the experience.\n\n23\n00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.130\nSo I'm probably not going to give you\nanything earth shattering or new here.\n\n24\n00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.650\nBut it's important that we understand it\ncuz it's all on the exam objectives and\n\n25\n00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.480\nthese are the things\nthat we need to study.\n\n26\n00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.970\nSo let's kick things off by\ntalking about IP addressing.\n\n27\n00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.735\nNow, the first thing I wanna mention\nbefore I dive too far into IP addressing,\n\n28\n00:01:16.735 --> 00:01:20.633\nis that it's not like the old days where\nthere was just one type of IP addressing.\n\n29\n00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:25.239\nNow we've got two, IPv4 and IPv6, right.\n\n30\n00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:28.115\nIP is the internet protocol,\nversion 4 is the old version, and\n\n31\n00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:30.250\nversion 6 is the new version.\n\n32\n00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.310\nWhen you configure a server, you may need\nto configure one or the other or both.\n\n33\n00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.000\nA lot of people run dual stack\nwhere they're both configured.\n\n34\n00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.360\nIn fact, if you're installing something\nlike a Microsoft Windows Server,\n\n35\n00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.420\nit'll have both, IPv4 and\nIPv6 running by default.\n\n36\n00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.750\nIf you're setting up a Red Hat server,\nit'll have both enabled for\n\n37\n00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.480\nautomatic addressing by default.\n\n38\n00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.050\nThere's other systems that still\njust default to IPv4 though, so\n\n39\n00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.980\nyou'll need to check with your\ndistribution, whatever operating system it\n\n40\n00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.210\nis you're running,\nto determine which one you've got.\n\n41\n00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.390\nBut after that, the rest of the settings\nare all pretty much the same.\n\n42\n00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.680\nSo, hey,\nhow do I choose which protocol I want?\n\n43\n00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.630\nWell, for most of us,\nit's not really much of a choice.\n\n44\n00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.790\nIPv4 is the current standard\nthat everybody supports,\n\n45\n00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.070\nIPv6 is the new standard.\n\n46\n00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.230\nI hate calling it new because it was,\nwhen was it,\n\n47\n00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.500\nit was RFC 20 years ago it seems like.\n\n48\n00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.210\nIt was a long time ago.\n\n49\n00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.440\n&gt;&gt; It's been around for a long time.\n\n50\n00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.240\n&gt;&gt; And so it's one of those things\nthat is just still catching on, right?\n\n51\n00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.060\nSo IPv6 is widely supported across\nthe Internet but not everyone runs it yet.\n\n52\n00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.870\nSo you're pretty much guaranteed to\nuse IPv4 versus IPv6 which you may or\n\n53\n00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.050\nmay not have.\n\n54\n00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.980\nNow, the big difference between\nthe two is simply address space.\n\n55\n00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.600\nUnder IPv4, you have a 32-bit\naddress which allows for up to, and\n\n56\n00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.760\nI always screw this number up,\nit's around 4.3 billion IP addresses.\n\n57\n00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.840\nAnd I know that sounds like a lot.\n\n58\n00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.727\nIt sounded like a lot when they\ncreated TCP/IP back in the late '70s,\n\n59\n00:02:54.727 --> 00:02:57.240\nearly '80s but it's just not enough.\n\n60\n00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.995\nIf you think about over 6\nbillion people on planet Earth,\n\n61\n00:02:59.995 --> 00:03:04.230\n4.3 billion IPs that's not enough for\neveryone to have one address.\n\n62\n00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.130\nSo there is a shortage and\n\n63\n00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.430\nthat shortage is the real thing it's going\non right now, IPv6 works to fix that.\n\n64\n00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.980\nIPv6 gives an address\nspace that is massive,\n\n65\n00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.388\nI don't even know how to say the number.\n\n66\n00:03:17.388 --> 00:03:19.212\nIt's a 128-bit address,\n\n67\n00:03:19.212 --> 00:03:23.918\nwhich is significantly larger than\nthe 32-bit address that we had in IPv4.\n\n68\n00:03:23.918 --> 00:03:28.359\nAnd we start to get into numbers that have\nnames like undecillions and all that mess.\n\n69\n00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.388\nSo I'll put the actual number in the show\nnotes for you guys if you wanna see it.\n\n70\n00:03:31.388 --> 00:03:36.605\nBut the way it boils out, the way I like\nto explain it is that if we took IPv4 with\n\n71\n00:03:36.605 --> 00:03:42.223\n4.3 billion IPs, under IPv6, you could\ngive 4.3 billion IPs to every single\n\n72\n00:03:42.223 --> 00:03:48.690\nperson on the planet Earth, all 6 billion\npeople could have 4.3 billion IPs each.\n\n73\n00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.668\nLike that's how big this address space is.\n\n74\n00:03:50.668 --> 00:03:51.940\nAnd so that's why we're moving to it,\nright?\n\n75\n00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.934\nThat's why we wanna get our servers,\nget our services over to it.\n\n76\n00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:57.934\nBut there's a lot of things that have\nto fall into place before you can\n\n77\n00:03:57.934 --> 00:03:58.617\nsupport that.\n\n78\n00:03:58.617 --> 00:04:02.597\nYour operating system has to support it,\nyour local network, your router switches,\n\n79\n00:04:02.597 --> 00:04:04.515\nyou firewalls, they need to support it.\n\n80\n00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:05.907\nYou need your ISP to support it,\n\n81\n00:04:05.907 --> 00:04:08.385\nwhoever who's providing your\nInternet connections and\n\n82\n00:04:08.385 --> 00:04:12.061\nthen whoever it is you're connecting to on\nthe other side, they need to support it.\n\n83\n00:04:12.061 --> 00:04:15.939\nAnd when all of you support it,\nnow you can communicate using IPv6.\n\n84\n00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.170\nAnd that's why it's been\nsuch a slow progression.\n\n85\n00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.130\n&gt;&gt; Don, one of the things you've mentioned\nis that operating systems have to support.\n\n86\n00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.940\nAnd I know going back as far, at least\nin the Windows world, going back to\n\n87\n00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.700\nthe days of Vista, it's been dual stack,\nso there's been support for a while.\n\n88\n00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.110\nAnd you could always add\nthe Service Pack 3 of XP.\n\n89\n00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.250\nHow about the Linux and the Unix realm,\nas far as operating support?\n\n90\n00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.440\nHave we seen that for a while now?\n\n91\n00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.380\n&gt;&gt; For a long time.\n\n92\n00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.400\nI mean, that's where a lot\nof this stuff originated.\n\n93\n00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.720\nI know I worked on Solaris boxes in\nthe late 90s that had IPv6 support\n\n94\n00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.160\nwell before Microsoft did.\n\n95\n00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.250\nSome people released it as an\nafterthought, something that was added on,\n\n96\n00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.290\nbut most of the Unix systems brought\nit right into the kernel and\n\n97\n00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.210\nyou had it up and running really shortly.\n\n98\n00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.010\nWe see it in Mac OS,\n\n99\n00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.860\nif you're running Mac servers,\nif you're running Linux distributions.\n\n100\n00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.340\nI can't think of a Linux distribution\nright now that doesn't support IPv6.\n\n101\n00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.680\nSame things for BSD as well as Windows.\n\n102\n00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.250\nIt's pretty much ubiquitous at this point.\n\n103\n00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.920\nAll right, now when I wanna\nget this setup on my system,\n\n104\n00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.300\nI need to know which address\nI'm gonna be setting up.\n\n105\n00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.740\nAnd then I just need to go in and do it.\n\n106\n00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.210\nNow the way you configure is different\ndepending on your operating system.\n\n107\n00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.240\nSome OS's make it really easy,\nsome make it a little more difficult but\n\n108\n00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.760\nthe settings are what I wanna focus\non here in this episode, not so\n\n109\n00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.120\nmuch the operating system.\n\n110\n00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.270\nSo I'm gonna take a Red Hat system.\n\n111\n00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.610\nSo I'm running Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nversion 7, and if you have the graphical\n\n112\n00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.380\nuser interface, you've got a nice little\nutility up here where you can go in and\n\n113\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.850\nmodify your network adapters.\n\n114\n00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.070\nAnd so I'm gonna modify my wired adapter.\n\n115\n00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.100\nI'll just jump into this settings here.\n\n116\n00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.090\nAnd what you're going to see\na summary of your system.\n\n117\n00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.720\nNow my system is set for defaults and\nmost systems are going to\n\n118\n00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.180\ndefault using DHCP,\nthe dynamic host configuration protocol.\n\n119\n00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.100\nWhich means, I turn this computer on, and\nit doesn't have an address and so it just\n\n120\n00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.690\nasks the network, hey, anybody out there,\nI need an address, can you give me one?\n\n121\n00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.870\nAnd hopefully there's a DHCP server on\nthe network listing and then answers back.\n\n122\n00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.700\nAll right, now,\nif you look at my addresses here,\n\n123\n00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.790\nI see I got an IPv4 address,\nand an IPv6 address, right?\n\n124\n00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.720\nI didn't configure that.\n\n125\n00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.103\nWhen I installed Red Hat,\nthat was its default,\n\n126\n00:06:16.103 --> 00:06:19.547\nthat it was going to dynamically\nget addresses for these interfaces.\n\n127\n00:06:19.547 --> 00:06:24.505\nNow, on our network here in the ITProTV\nstudios, we don't use IPv6 yet.\n\n128\n00:06:24.505 --> 00:06:28.378\nWe have it enabled on some devices,\nbut it's not enabled on our firewalls,\n\n129\n00:06:28.378 --> 00:06:32.431\nit's not enabled on our router and so\nwe're not handing out addresses with it,\n\n130\n00:06:32.431 --> 00:06:35.280\nmachines have to do\ntheir own configuration.\n\n131\n00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.200\nAnd I can see that that's what mine's done\nhere, it's done its' own configuration.\n\n132\n00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.400\nAnd I know that because of the very\nfirst part of that address.\n\n133\n00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.884\nWhen you look at these addresses,\n\n134\n00:06:44.884 --> 00:06:47.609\nthey're not just random numbers\nthey actually have meaning.\n\n135\n00:06:47.609 --> 00:06:51.770\nEach part tells us a little bit\nof story about that address.\n\n136\n00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.370\nSo when you assign an address\nyou can't just make one up,\n\n137\n00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.560\nyou've got to actually pick one with\npurpose and assign the right values.\n\n138\n00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.830\nWhen I look at this IPv6\naddress it starts with fe80 and\n\n139\n00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:07.060\nthat's an indicator right there\nthat this is a link local address.\n\n140\n00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.232\nIt's an address I can use to talk to other\nmachines right here on the same network as\n\n141\n00:07:11.232 --> 00:07:13.544\nme but\nI can't use it to talk to the Internet.\n\n142\n00:07:13.544 --> 00:07:18.259\nI mean the real IPv6 address,\nnot a link local address, right.\n\n143\n00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:23.746\nSame thing goes for IPv4,\nwith IPv4 my address starts with a 10 and\n\n144\n00:07:23.746 --> 00:07:26.930\na 10 that's a private IP.\n\n145\n00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.210\nUnder IPv4, you have private and\npublic addresses.\n\n146\n00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.030\nPrivate addresses are ones\nthat you can use internally,\n\n147\n00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.250\nyou can use without telling anybody,\nthey're just yours,\n\n148\n00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.350\nyou use them internally, you're not\nallowed to use them on the Internet.\n\n149\n00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.660\nBut if you wanna talk on the Internet,\nyou've got to use a public address.\n\n150\n00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.230\nA public IP address is one\nthat's registered with the IANA,\n\n151\n00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.990\nor one of those organizations, ARIN.\n\n152\n00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.484\nAnd you register that address so\n\n153\n00:07:51.484 --> 00:07:54.759\nthat you are the only person in\nthe entire world that has that address.\n\n154\n00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:56.461\nThat's what a public address is.\n\n155\n00:07:56.461 --> 00:07:59.477\nIf two people have the same address,\nthat would be a big problem, right, so\n\n156\n00:07:59.477 --> 00:08:00.337\nwe can't have that.\n\n157\n00:08:00.337 --> 00:08:04.932\nSo that's make it where we need\nuniqueness on a public address.\n\n158\n00:08:04.932 --> 00:08:08.790\nWell, if I've got 100\ncomputers here in the studios,\n\n159\n00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.426\nI don't wanna have to go out and\nbuy 100 public IPs.\n\n160\n00:08:12.426 --> 00:08:16.850\nWe've got an IP shortage as it is, right,\nfor IPv4, so I don't wanna do that.\n\n161\n00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.936\nInstead, I can use private IPs, fake IPs.\n\n162\n00:08:19.936 --> 00:08:21.221\nNo, they're not fake.\n\n163\n00:08:21.221 --> 00:08:23.370\nThey're real, but\nthey're just not allowed on the Internet.\n\n164\n00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.710\nAnd then I can use other technologies to\nget out to the Internet which I'll talk\n\n165\n00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.300\nabout a bit later,\nlike network address translation.\n\n166\n00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.420\nSo when we assign an IPv4 address,\n\n167\n00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.220\nwe need to pick whether we're assigning\na public or a private address.\n\n168\n00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.500\nAnd we do assign\nthe address appropriately.\n\n169\n00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.008\nAll right, in my case I see I\ngot a dynamic one, 10.0.14.240.\n\n170\n00:08:42.008 --> 00:08:45.575\nThat 10 is how I know\nit's a private address.\n\n171\n00:08:45.575 --> 00:08:52.510\nThere's an RFC 1918 that defines\nthe private IPs for IPv4.\n\n172\n00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:56.715\nAnd basically the way it works is\nthere's a Class A where the first octet,\n\n173\n00:08:56.715 --> 00:08:58.603\nthis first number,\nstarts with a 10, right?\n\n174\n00:08:58.603 --> 00:09:02.283\nSo if I've got a 10,\nI know it's a private IP.\n\n175\n00:09:02.283 --> 00:09:08.378\nIt started with 172.16 all\nthe way through 172.31,\n\n176\n00:09:08.378 --> 00:09:11.060\nthose are private IPs also.\n\n177\n00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:16.490\nAnd if it started with 192.168,\nthat's a private IP range also.\n\n178\n00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.098\nSo those three ranges I\ncan keep an eye out for.\n\n179\n00:09:18.098 --> 00:09:21.815\nAnd if I see those, I know I've got\na private address that's not allowed on\n\n180\n00:09:21.815 --> 00:09:23.650\nthe Internet without a little help.\n\n181\n00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:29.441\nIf it starts with something other than\n10.172.16 to 31, or 192.168, then I know\n\n182\n00:09:29.441 --> 00:09:34.370\nit's gonna be a public address, and it can\ntalk to the Internet without any help.\n\n183\n00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.720\nIt just needs to reach out to a router,\nand then off it goes, right?\n\n184\n00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.226\nIt doesn't have to be changed.\n\n185\n00:09:38.226 --> 00:09:43.270\nUnder IPv6,\nIPv6 is such a massive address space.\n\n186\n00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:48.140\nIt's so large that we don't need\nprivate and public any more.\n\n187\n00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:48.790\nThey do have them.\n\n188\n00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:52.270\nThere is a private range set aside for\nIPv6, but because there's so\n\n189\n00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:56.020\nmany addresses, we can give a truly unique\n\n190\n00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:00.000\npublic IP to every machine on our\nnetwork and there's no big deal.\n\n191\n00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.370\nSo under IPv6, we don't worry so\nmuch about public and private any more.\n\n192\n00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.820\nWe just use public IPs for\neverything and off we go.\n\n193\n00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.180\nBut you still need to be able to talk\nto people locally even if you don't\n\n194\n00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.030\nhave a connection to the Internet.\n\n195\n00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.447\nAnd that's where these link\nlocal addresses come in,\n\n196\n00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.346\nthat FEA that we're seeing here, right?\n\n197\n00:10:16.346 --> 00:10:19.749\nSo I know these are dynamic, but\nit doesn't actually come right out and\n\n198\n00:10:19.749 --> 00:10:20.270\nsay that.\n\n199\n00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.132\nI had to figure that out.\n\n200\n00:10:21.132 --> 00:10:23.970\nI just knew, I recognized those addresses.\n\n201\n00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:27.730\nBut if I jump into the configuration for\nthis, and I come in here and\n\n202\n00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:32.740\nI take a look at the IPv4 settings, I can\nsee where it's getting that IPv4 address.\n\n203\n00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.710\nAnd right now,\nmine is set to automatic, right, DHCP.\n\n204\n00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.400\nOn a workstation, DHCP is great.\n\n205\n00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.920\nOn a server, not so much.\n\n206\n00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.390\nWhen we're setting up a new server,\nwe usually want it to have an IP address.\n\n207\n00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.880\nLet's say, for example,\nthat I'm setting up a DNS server.\n\n208\n00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.850\nI want people to use my server for\nDNS, right?\n\n209\n00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.835\nSo this is gonna be the DNS server.\nMaybe I'm gonna throw a bind or\n\n210\n00:10:53.835 --> 00:10:58.510\nsomething else on there and I want people\nto do lookups against this system.\n\n211\n00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.350\nSo I got an address, right?\n\n212\n00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.720\nMy address is 10.0.14.240.\n\n213\n00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.320\nI can then go to all the other\ncomputers here in the studio and\n\n214\n00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.074\nset them to do a DNS lookup\nagainst 10.0.14.240.\n\n215\n00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.186\nBut when I get a dynamic address,\n\n216\n00:11:13.186 --> 00:11:17.880\nI have a lease, a certain period of time\nthat I'm gonna have that address for.\n\n217\n00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.724\nAnd if I don't renew that lease, then I\ngive up the address and I get a new one.\n\n218\n00:11:21.724 --> 00:11:25.280\nAnytime I reboot,\nI can potentially lose my address.\n\n219\n00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.660\nOr if the machine is off for\na long period of time, I could lose it.\n\n220\n00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.598\nServers aren't normally off for\na long time, so it's not a big deal.\n\n221\n00:11:31.598 --> 00:11:35.760\nBut the DHCP server might reset its\ndatabase, and now we get a new address.\n\n222\n00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.825\nAnd if I get a new address, all the people\nout there that are connecting to me to do\n\n223\n00:11:39.825 --> 00:11:43.770\nDNS lookups, I need to go and\nupdate them to point to a new DNS server.\n\n224\n00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:44.960\nThat's not ideal, right?\n\n225\n00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.610\nWe don't want that.\n\n226\n00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:49.460\nSo on a server, we're normally\ngonna do a static IP assignment.\n\n227\n00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.060\nStatic is where I manually\nset the address here and\n\n228\n00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.100\nthen I don't have to worry about it again.\n\n229\n00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.430\nIt's always gonna have that one address.\n\n230\n00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.860\nNow there's more than one reason for\nwhy we do this on a server, right?\n\n231\n00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.550\nCuz there are people out there that say,\nwell, Don, I really like using DHCP,\n\n232\n00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:07.490\nbecause I can set up a DHCP\nreservation that says,\n\n233\n00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:11.202\nwhen this server comes up,\nthe server always gets the same IP.\n\n234\n00:12:11.202 --> 00:12:13.230\nSo now it's gonna get that same IP, right?\n\n235\n00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:17.950\nAnd then I just get this dynamic\naddressing and it works great.\n\n236\n00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:22.825\nThe problem is what if my server\nreboots while the DHCP server is down?\n\n237\n00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:26.755\nYou see this in virtualization\nenvironments a lot, where the DHCP\n\n238\n00:12:26.755 --> 00:12:30.840\nserver's running in a VM and\nthe host underneath it needs to reboot.\n\n239\n00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.160\nAnd so maybe that VM goes offline for\na moment while that host is rebooting.\n\n240\n00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.710\nAnd now that host can't get a dynamic\naddress cuz the DHCP server isn't up yet.\n\n241\n00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:43.400\nSo we want to use static IPs on those\nservers so they can come up and\n\n242\n00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.730\nbe independent of a DHCP server.\n\n243\n00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.580\nWe don't want to be dependent on\nanything that we don't have to be.\n\n244\n00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.980\nAssigning a manual IP is the way to do it.\n\n245\n00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.180\nNow we don't like to do manuals on\nworkstations, because we have so\n\n246\n00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:53.960\nmany of them.\n\n247\n00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.120\nIt's hard to document the IPs we use and\nall of that.\n\n248\n00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.580\nYou might issue duplicate IPs by accident.\n\n249\n00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.630\nYou don't normally have\nthat many servers though.\n\n250\n00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.050\nEven a large organization's only\ngonna have a few hundred servers.\n\n251\n00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.760\nSo it's not that hard to\nkeep track of those IPs.\n\n252\n00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.790\nNow if you're a massive organization,\nmaybe\n\n253\n00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.020\nit's not the size of the organization,\nit's the technology that matters here.\n\n254\n00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.188\nThat's gonna be a slogan.\nBut if you're Netflix, right, I don't know\n\n255\n00:13:17.188 --> 00:13:22.260\nhow many employees Netflix has but they\nprobably have less than 2,000 employees.\n\n256\n00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.130\nIt's an all digital, online company.\n\n257\n00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.740\nThey don't have salespeople out there.\n\n258\n00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.730\nIt's all online marketing.\n\n259\n00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.040\nSo it's probably not a huge\norganization as far as people.\n\n260\n00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.930\nBut as far as servers,\nyou can bet they're huge.\n\n261\n00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.370\nThey probably have thousands of servers\nspread across the globe to be able to\n\n262\n00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.340\nprovide, if not tens of thousands,\n\n263\n00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.970\nservice to provide all the video\nstreaming that they do.\n\n264\n00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.557\nAre you gonna track IPs on 10,000 servers?\n\n265\n00:13:43.557 --> 00:13:46.170\nNo, that's a nightmare.\n\n266\n00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.100\nThere is third party software\nthat can help you manage and\n\n267\n00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.672\ntrack all that and keep keep all of it\nstraight, but you're gonna use DHTP.\n\n268\n00:13:52.672 --> 00:13:54.092\nAnd in those situations,\n\n269\n00:13:54.092 --> 00:13:57.776\nyou need to develop your solutions\nto use host names instead of IPs.\n\n270\n00:13:57.776 --> 00:14:00.424\nWe need to be able to connect to\na hostname so the IPs can change and\n\n271\n00:14:00.424 --> 00:14:02.250\nwe don't have to track them.\n\n272\n00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:07.150\nBut if I'm setting up a DNS server,\nDNS is doing the host name resolution.\n\n273\n00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.820\nSo I can't count on that,\nI can't count on that being available,\n\n274\n00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.220\nI need to use a static IP.\n\n275\n00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.730\nSo you need to make the decision for\nyour solution.\n\n276\n00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.230\nThere are gonna be times where even on\na server you might wanna do a dynamic\n\n277\n00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.370\naddress, but for\nthe most part we're gonna do statics.\n\n278\n00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.690\nSo when we do a static, what we do\nis we come into our settings, and\n\n279\n00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.190\ninstead of choosing Automatic,\nwe'll choose Manual.\n\n280\n00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:30.800\nAnd once we go manual, we can provide\nthe three core pieces of data.\n\n281\n00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.270\nFor a machine to communicate on\nthe network, there's really just,\n\n282\n00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:38.030\ntechnically there's just two things\nthat we need, an address and a netmask.\n\n283\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:39.200\nIf I have an address and a netmask,\n\n284\n00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.139\nI can talk to other machines\non my local network.\n\n285\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.820\nIf I wanna get out to the Internet,\nthough, or get up to other networks,\n\n286\n00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.240\nother subnets,\nI'm gonna need a gateway also.\n\n287\n00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.715\nThe router I go to when I can't talk\nto somebody that's on my network.\n\n288\n00:14:50.715 --> 00:14:52.269\nSo I'm gonna assign a static IP.\n\n289\n00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:58.275\nI'm gonna make this one,\n10.0.222., I don't know 101.\n\n290\n00:14:58.275 --> 00:15:01.900\nAll right, so I'm gonna punch that in.\n\n291\n00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.957\nHere in Red Hat it's actually doing\na little error checking for me.\n\n292\n00:15:04.957 --> 00:15:07.179\nSo if I type in a bad address,\nsee how it turns red?\n\n293\n00:15:07.179 --> 00:15:08.893\nNot every distribution does that.\n\n294\n00:15:08.893 --> 00:15:13.884\nSome won't even let you type\nin a bad number, some will.\n\n295\n00:15:13.884 --> 00:15:15.722\nBut they're just kind of\nchecking that number for me.\n\n296\n00:15:15.722 --> 00:15:16.469\nThat's why it turned red.\n\n297\n00:15:16.469 --> 00:15:18.239\nAnd I need to provide a netmask.\n\n298\n00:15:18.239 --> 00:15:21.329\nNow netmasks can be\nmisunderstood pretty easily.\n\n299\n00:15:21.329 --> 00:15:25.394\nWhen I look at my address,\npart of my address is a network ID and\n\n300\n00:15:25.394 --> 00:15:27.770\npart of it is a host ID.\n\n301\n00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.954\nThe network ID, if I have 20 computers and\nthey all have the same network ID,\n\n302\n00:15:30.954 --> 00:15:33.968\nthey'll all be able to talk to each\nother without going through a router.\n\n303\n00:15:33.968 --> 00:15:35.625\nIf they have different network IDs,\n\n304\n00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:38.790\nthey'll have to go through\na router to talk to each other.\n\n305\n00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:43.430\nThe subnet mask is what identifies\nwhat is our network ID.\n\n306\n00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:47.250\nAnd there are a ton of different\nsubnet masks that can be used.\n\n307\n00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:51.070\nAnd I don't wanna dive too deep into it\nhere cuz it's covered in Network Plus and\n\n308\n00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.830\nthings that you guys should\nalready be familiar with.\n\n309\n00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:55.004\nBut there's three primary\nnetwork masks that we use.\n\n310\n00:15:55.004 --> 00:15:59.073\nThere's the old class A,\nthe old class B, and the old class C.\n\n311\n00:15:59.073 --> 00:16:00.871\nI say the old,\nnobody uses classes anymore.\n\n312\n00:16:00.871 --> 00:16:01.733\nEverything's classless.\n\n313\n00:16:01.733 --> 00:16:05.693\nBut these net masks have kinda stayed\nbecause they're so easy to read.\n\n314\n00:16:05.693 --> 00:16:10.640\nThe class A subnet mask was 255.0.0.0.\n\n315\n00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:16.400\nAnd what that means is that when I look at\nan IP address, this 255 is the network ID.\n\n316\n00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.650\nSo the 10 is my network ID.\n\n317\n00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:22.760\nAnd everything else is the host ID.\n\n318\n00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.730\nWith this network mask I can talk to\nanybody who's IP starts with a 10 without\n\n319\n00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.260\ngoing through a router.\n\n320\n00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.510\nIf they start with an 11,\nI've gotta go through a router.\n\n321\n00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.875\nSo, that separation.\n\n322\n00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:37.077\nI can do a class B which\nwould be 255.255.0.0.\n\n323\n00:16:37.077 --> 00:16:40.640\nThis tells me that the first two\noctets are part of the network ID.\n\n324\n00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.232\nSo, anybody who starts with 10.0,\nI can talk to.\n\n325\n00:16:44.232 --> 00:16:48.968\nAnd then we go to the old class\nC which is 255.255.255.0.\n\n326\n00:16:48.968 --> 00:16:51.552\nNow, if somebody out there\nstarted with 10.0.222,\n\n327\n00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:53.747\nI could talk to them without\ngoing through a router.\n\n328\n00:16:53.747 --> 00:16:56.440\nSo having the right net mask is important.\n\n329\n00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.189\nAnd a lot of people learn at home and\nthey learn with like 192.168.0 or\n\n330\n00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:03.680\n192.168.1 which is a home\nrouter set up for.\n\n331\n00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:10.857\nAnd they use this subnet mask right\nhere which is a network of 254 machines.\n\n332\n00:17:10.857 --> 00:17:14.643\nFor a home, that's plenty, but for\nan office, for a data center, for\n\n333\n00:17:14.643 --> 00:17:16.610\nan enterprise, that's not a lot.\n\n334\n00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:20.180\nAnd so, it's pretty rare that we use the\nsubnet mask in a corporate environment.\n\n335\n00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.720\nWe're usually using larger networks.\n\n336\n00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.960\nAnd, when you do that,\n\n337\n00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.520\nyou use different subnet masks,\nyou gotta make sure you get this correct.\n\n338\n00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.410\nIf you get it wrong, you might be able to\ntalk to some hosts and not talk to others,\n\n339\n00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:34.020\nand that can really create\na problem on the network.\n\n340\n00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:39.470\nNow here in our studios, we use the 10.0\nnetwork and we use it as a class\n\n341\n00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:42.730\nB even though technically, to be a class\nA, everything is classless these days.\n\n342\n00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:46.220\nSo you can use whatever\nsubnet mask you want.\n\n343\n00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.210\nAll right, so\n\n344\n00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:52.800\nnow I can talk to anybody whose IP starts\nwith 10.0, but what about everybody else?\n\n345\n00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.420\nFor everybody else, I need to go\nthrough a router and your router,\n\n346\n00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.680\nit might be a dedicated device that is a\nrouter, it might be a layer three switch,\n\n347\n00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.740\nit might be a firewall.\n\n348\n00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.700\nHere in the studios, we actually\ndo those straight to a firewall.\n\n349\n00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.600\nWe have a router on the outside of the\nfirewall not the inside because firewalls\n\n350\n00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.460\ncan rout.\n\n351\n00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.340\nSo, I'm gonna punch in the IP address\nof our firewall in the network and\n\n352\n00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.110\nthat's who I'm gonna go to.\n\n353\n00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:18.788\nIf I ever wanna get to a network\nthat doesn't start with 10.0,\n\n354\n00:18:18.788 --> 00:18:21.980\nI'll go to the firewall, and\nit will help me the rest of the way out.\n\n355\n00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:25.990\nOnce that's set, I'm done.\n\n356\n00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.840\nI can now talk to the network.\n\n357\n00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.050\nI can get out to the internet,\nI can do all sorts of great stuff.\n\n358\n00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.160\nI can come down here and\n\n359\n00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:35.690\nhit the old Apply button and\nlet me reset that network adapter.\n\n360\n00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:36.550\nThere we go.\n\n361\n00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.390\nAnd I can see I got my address,\n10.0.222.101, I got my default route,\n\n362\n00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.800\nI'm good to go.\n\n363\n00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.930\nWell, to an extent, right?\n\n364\n00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.865\nIf I test this out, whoops.\n\n365\n00:18:47.865 --> 00:18:51.930\n[LAUGH] If I test it out by making\nmy screen go crazy, there we go.\n\n366\n00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:57.830\nI should be able to verify my address,\nif I do a ip addr,\n\n367\n00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:03.430\nI can see I've got 10.0.222.101,\nright, so there's my address.\n\n368\n00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:07.510\nAnd, if I try and ping somebody like\nour firewall, I can ping it, so\n\n369\n00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.420\nI'm able to talk to other hosts\nright here on the network with me.\n\n370\n00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.719\nAnd if I try and\nping out to the internet, right?\n\n371\n00:19:12.719 --> 00:19:16.165\nSo, somebody like that,\nI can get all the way up to the internet,\n\n372\n00:19:16.165 --> 00:19:18.063\nthings are working great, right?\n\n373\n00:19:18.063 --> 00:19:22.120\nBut I didn't set up name lookups.\n\n374\n00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.250\nSo if I try and access something by name,\nthat's not gonna work.\n\n375\n00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.270\nSo that's usually the next\nthing that we set up.\n\n376\n00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.480\nIt's not technically required.\n\n377\n00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.020\nIf everything you're doing is based\non IPs, you don't need name lookups.\n\n378\n00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.480\nBut it's usually the next step for\nus, right?\n\n379\n00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:39.425\nSo I'm gonna go back into my network\nsettings and we'll get that set up.\n\n380\n00:19:39.425 --> 00:19:43.250\nOops, I'm gonna click the wrong\nthing here, there we go.\n\n381\n00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.890\nAll right, so I was under IPv4 and\n\n382\n00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:50.420\nI set my address net mask gateway and\nif I keep scrolling down, you'll see DNS.\n\n383\n00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.350\nRight, which is the domain naming service.\n\n384\n00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:57.030\nThe domain name service,\nit's been around a long time.\n\n385\n00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:04.310\nIt was developed under BSD at the-\n&gt;&gt; Berkeley University of California?\n\n386\n00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was done in part by them and\na part by a few other organizations.\n\n387\n00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.760\nBerkeley's really known for BIND.\n\n388\n00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.930\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; The original DNS server that's kind\n\n389\n00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.340\nof the core of everything that we create.\n\n390\n00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.160\nSo, we kind of attribute it there, but\n\n391\n00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.080\nthere were several different people\nthat were involved in creating it.\n\n392\n00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.100\nBut, they recognize early on that hey,\nit's not easy to remember IP addresses.\n\n393\n00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.350\nSo, it's easier to remember names.\n\n394\n00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.710\nAnd we can map the names\nto the IP addresses, right?\n\n395\n00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:29.080\nAnd so, we need to point to a DNS\nserver to be able to connect to that.\n\n396\n00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.970\nSo I can just specify one and\nI'll use Google's.\n\n397\n00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:33.690\nGoogle has public DNS servers.\n\n398\n00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.900\nYou might have internal DNS\nservers that you want to use.\n\n399\n00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:36.888\nMost companies do.\n\n400\n00:20:36.888 --> 00:20:40.155\nIf you have things like Microsoft Active\nDirectory, you need to look at your own\n\n401\n00:20:40.155 --> 00:20:42.692\nDNS servers to find all your\ndirectory entries, otherwise,\n\n402\n00:20:42.692 --> 00:20:45.997\nthey're gonna be missing from your public\nones, but I'm gonna punch that in.\n\n403\n00:20:45.997 --> 00:20:48.749\nNow, when I populate the DNS server,\n\n404\n00:20:48.749 --> 00:20:54.570\nI can leave it just like it is here and\nI'm done or I can add more than one.\n\n405\n00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:58.380\nIt is a good idea to have two, right?\n\n406\n00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:02.119\nSo I'm gonna add maybe another Googles,\nright?\n\n407\n00:21:02.119 --> 00:21:03.210\n8.8.4.4.\n\n408\n00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:08.270\nNow, when I do that, I've got\na primary DNS server and a secondary.\n\n409\n00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.700\nMy machine is only gonna\nuse the first one.\n\n410\n00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:15.150\nI'm only gonna use 8.8.8.8,\nunless it goes down.\n\n411\n00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:19.236\nIf it fails, then I go to 8.8.4.4.\n\n412\n00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:21.672\nI've seen people get really hard core.\n\n413\n00:21:21.672 --> 00:21:22.410\nAnd like, you know what?\n\n414\n00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.640\nI'm gonna add a bunch because\nI want full redundancy.\n\n415\n00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.970\nHey, these are Google, let me add layer\nthree, level three communications and\n\n416\n00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:33.450\nwe'll come in here and punch them in,\nthey have three servers.\n\n417\n00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.440\nWe'll punch them in, so there.\n\n418\n00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.310\nNow I got five.\n\n419\n00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.950\nThis is super redundancy.\n\n420\n00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.980\nBut, it really is overkill\nbecause this last one, 4.2.2.3,\n\n421\n00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:46.650\nwe're not gonna get to that one unless\nall four of these others have failed.\n\n422\n00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:49.540\nWhat are the odds of all\nfour of these failing?\n\n423\n00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:53.620\nIf all four of these have failed, there's\nsomething really wrong with the internet,\n\n424\n00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.400\nand you've got bigger problems than\nname lookups to worry about, right?\n\n425\n00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.630\nSo, this is something that's\ngonna be catastrophic.\n\n426\n00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.300\nSo, typically, I don't go crazy on this.\n\n427\n00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.070\nJust do two.\n\n428\n00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:07.499\nI do recommend that you do two that\nare in different subnets, right?\n\n429\n00:22:07.499 --> 00:22:11.860\nNotice I've got 4.2.2.1,\n4.2.2.2, 4.2.2.3, all right?\n\n430\n00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.120\nI don't care how you're subnetting that.\n\n431\n00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.780\nThose are all gonna be\nin the same network.\n\n432\n00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.950\nNo matter how small you make that network,\n\n433\n00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:21.220\nthese three are all gonna\nbe in the same subnet.\n\n434\n00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.050\nWhat if I lose my route to that subnet?\n\n435\n00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.180\nI could lose all three, or\nthose three servers could be up and happy.\n\n436\n00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.070\nBut if I lose my route,\n\n437\n00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:33.300\nif I have a routing table problem,\nI just lost all three servers.\n\n438\n00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.190\nAnd that happens, right?\n\n439\n00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:38.220\nIt happened to Microsoft a few years ago\nwhere they had massive server clusters set\n\n440\n00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.280\nup for their DNS servers,\n\n441\n00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.990\nand they were all on the same subnet and\nthe route went down.\n\n442\n00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.710\nAnd they learned their lesson and\nnow they're spread out, right?\n\n443\n00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.300\nGoogle, if you look at theirs.\n\n444\n00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:53.148\nSure they both start with 8.8, but\nyou've got 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.\n\n445\n00:22:53.148 --> 00:22:57.355\nAnd they're in two completely different\nlocations using two completely different\n\n446\n00:22:57.355 --> 00:22:58.605\nroutes that get you there.\n\n447\n00:22:58.605 --> 00:23:01.945\nThis gives you more network redundancy\nto get to those destinations.\n\n448\n00:23:01.945 --> 00:23:04.555\nBut you might even wanna do\nvendor independence, right?\n\n449\n00:23:04.555 --> 00:23:08.790\nSo, instead of using it the way that\nI'm doing, you could come in and say,\n\n450\n00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:14.310\nI'm gonna do Google as my primary, and\nlevel three as my backup, or vice versa.\n\n451\n00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.710\nYou do have to be careful with this\nthough cuz sometimes you can get\n\n452\n00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.970\none response from Google and\na different response from level three,\n\n453\n00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.140\ndepending on whether DNS\nrecords are propagating out.\n\n454\n00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.190\nSo, I encourage you to make sure\nthat they're either at least two\n\n455\n00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.990\ndifferent networks.\n\n456\n00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.450\nWhen you start going multiple providers\njust make sure you test it out,\n\n457\n00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.240\nand then everything works out fine for\nyour use case scenario.\n\n458\n00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.370\nFor most people, it's perfectly fine.\n\n459\n00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.900\nAll right, so now I've got a little\nbit of redundancy there and\n\n460\n00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.830\ni'll be able to do my name lookups.\n\n461\n00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.970\nNow, DNS is not the only type of\nname lookup that's out there, right?\n\n462\n00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:47.054\nIf you've got Windows servers, Windows\nhas another type of lookup called WINS.\n\n463\n00:23:47.054 --> 00:23:52.500\nW-I-N-S which is\nthe Windows Internet Name Service.\n\n464\n00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.028\nIs that right?\nOkay.\n\n465\n00:23:53.028 --> 00:23:55.800\nSo [LAUGH] It's been a long\ntime since I've used it.\n\n466\n00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.032\nIt was created a long time ago, really,\n\n467\n00:23:58.032 --> 00:24:01.919\nby Intel because it was part of the old\nLAN manager suite that they had.\n\n468\n00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:05.127\nAnd, what it did was name resolution for\nlocal networks.\n\n469\n00:24:05.127 --> 00:24:08.610\nIt didn't use fully qualified\ndomain names, FQDNs.\n\n470\n00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:13.088\nWhen you look at a domain name like,\nwww.google.com,\n\n471\n00:24:13.088 --> 00:24:16.610\nright, www, that's the server.\n\n472\n00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.120\nAnd then, Google, that's the domain.\n\n473\n00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.890\nAnd com, that's the top-level domain.\n\n474\n00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:26.530\nSo, when Google bought their domain, they\nwent to a registrar that controlled .com.\n\n475\n00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.070\nAnd they bought Google.\n\n476\n00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.120\nAnd so then they had Google.com, and\nthen underneath it, they added www.\n\n477\n00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:37.040\nThere might be 100,000 servers across\nthis planet that are called www.\n\n478\n00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.370\nBut I know which one is Google's,\n\n479\n00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:43.000\nbecause of the fully qualified domain\nname, the FQDN, www.google.com.\n\n480\n00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.780\nWell, when the networking age\nkinda was just starting and we had\n\n481\n00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:54.050\nthe old netbios communications that were\njust local communications on a network.\n\n482\n00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:57.160\nI might have Windows 3.1 on my laptop.\n\n483\n00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.690\nProbably didn't have laptops then, so.\n\n484\n00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:02.460\nWindows 3.1 on my desktop and\nWes is over there running Windows 95.\n\n485\n00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:03.430\nYou just upgraded.\n\n486\n00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.440\nAnd we wanted to talk\nto each other by name.\n\n487\n00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:12.120\nWell, TCP/IP wasn't included in\nthose operating systems by default.\n\n488\n00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.840\nYou had to add it if you wanted it.\n\n489\n00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.900\nThat a lot of them still ran IPX/SPX or\n\n490\n00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:21.850\nNetBEUI or Banyan VINES or the crazy\nold protocols that are all gone now.\n\n491\n00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.840\nWell, when they wanted\nto do a name lookup,\n\n492\n00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.550\nthey didn't have a function for that.\n\n493\n00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:30.380\nAnd so, Microsoft created wins\nto be able to provide that and\n\n494\n00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:34.038\nit resolves single name to an IP.\n\n495\n00:25:34.038 --> 00:25:37.510\nSo I might have a name in\nthere called west laptop and\n\n496\n00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:41.570\nthen it maps to an IP or\nit maps to some other kind of address.\n\n497\n00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.560\nBut that's what Windows is\ntrying to do a single name,\n\n498\n00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.560\nit can give you qualified domains.\n\n499\n00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.840\nAnd that means it really wasn't\nsuitable for use on the Internet.\n\n500\n00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:53.150\nIt expected us to only have one\nmachine with a particular name.\n\n501\n00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:56.730\nIf there's a www, there's only one\nmachine called www, and that's it.\n\n502\n00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.820\nAnd that's not true of the whole world.\n\n503\n00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.470\nSo WINS was really just\nin the Microsoft world.\n\n504\n00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:04.720\nNow, you might ask yourself,\nwhy am I bothering to bring it up now?\n\n505\n00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.370\nThe problem is,\na lot of the old protocols are gone.\n\n506\n00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:09.610\nMost of us don't use NetBEUI at all.\n\n507\n00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:13.730\nAnd NetBIOS, even, is really reduced to\na very small portion about what we do.\n\n508\n00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:17.390\nBut there were a lot of software\napplications that were written that\n\n509\n00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:20.660\ndepended on it, and\nwe haven't moved away from those.\n\n510\n00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.560\nSo there are still some\npeople who need it.\n\n511\n00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.150\nSo if you install Windows Server today,\nyou can still add WINs to it.\n\n512\n00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:31.450\nEven though here we are in 2017,\nand you know, it's unconscionable.\n\n513\n00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:35.110\nI set up a WINs server for\nthe first time in 1998, I think.\n\n514\n00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:40.300\nAnd so here we are, almost 20 years\nlater and it's still out there, right?\n\n515\n00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.430\nBut just be aware, I'm on a Linux box, so\n\n516\n00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.220\nit doesn't have winds\nsupport baked into it.\n\n517\n00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:49.360\nIf I had Samba, it does, and I can do\nWINs lookups right from my Linux box.\n\n518\n00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.414\nBut for most of us,\nwe just have DNS, on a Windows box,\n\n519\n00:26:51.414 --> 00:26:54.307\nyou'll have another entry here for\nWINs which you may or may not need to use.\n\n520\n00:26:56.501 --> 00:27:00.165\nAll right, once I've got that setup\nI'm in pretty good shape here,\n\n521\n00:27:00.165 --> 00:27:02.258\nas far as getting my settings in place.\n\n522\n00:27:02.258 --> 00:27:07.080\nI've got my router, I've got my DNS,\nI've got my IP addresses set.\n\n523\n00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.890\nWe're pretty good to go on the IPv4 side.\n\n524\n00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:13.870\nOn the IPv6 side,\nit's not much different, right?\n\n525\n00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.920\nLet me just hit apply really quick,\nso the settings saved and\n\n526\n00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.950\nI'll go right back in and\nI'm gonna take a look at at the IPv6 side.\n\n527\n00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:25.420\nOn the IPv6 side, I've got right\nnow that my addresses is automatic.\n\n528\n00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.590\nAnd in IPv6, the addresses are so\n\n529\n00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:33.810\nlong that we really do rely on name\nlookups, more than we do on IPs.\n\n530\n00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:37.650\nAnd so, for most of our systems,\nwe may choose to leave them as automatic.\n\n531\n00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:41.122\nBut you can do a manual IP if you want.\n\n532\n00:27:41.122 --> 00:27:43.730\nAnd IPv6, you can set that, and\nyou can type it right in there.\n\n533\n00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.970\nYou can go link local only, so you're only\ntalking to people in the same network as\n\n534\n00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:51.300\nyou Or you can do automatic DHCP only or\nautomatic.\n\n535\n00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.130\nYou know, what's that about, right?\n\n536\n00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:55.170\nI thought automatic was DHCP.\n\n537\n00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:59.752\nWell IPv6 has ways of\ngenerating it's own address.\n\n538\n00:27:59.752 --> 00:28:04.420\nThere's a standard called Eli64,\nwhere it can use the Mac Address\n\n539\n00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:07.870\nassigned to the network adapter\nto call an IPv6 Address.\n\n540\n00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:12.600\nIt listens for a router on the network and\nit sees what subnet the router is in.\n\n541\n00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.540\nAnd it takes that subnet and\nthen it takes the MAC address,\n\n542\n00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.160\nthe network adapter,\npads it with a few extra values and\n\n543\n00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.650\npops that together to create a 128-bit\naddress that's unique to this machine.\n\n544\n00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:25.100\nYou don't get duplicates because you don't\nhave multiple machines with the same\n\n545\n00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.240\nMAC address.\n\n546\n00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.255\nAnd they're able to communicate,\nthat's automatic.\n\n547\n00:28:28.255 --> 00:28:31.991\nBut when you do automatic,\nwhere does it get its DNS servers from?\n\n548\n00:28:31.991 --> 00:28:33.917\nWhere does it get its\ndefault gateway from?\n\n549\n00:28:33.917 --> 00:28:37.546\nWell it can listen on the network\nto find those two, or,\n\n550\n00:28:37.546 --> 00:28:39.412\nyou can get those from DHCP.\n\n551\n00:28:39.412 --> 00:28:43.480\nAnd so there is DHCP for IPv6,\nit's just most people don't use it.\n\n552\n00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.861\nNormally we listen on the network and\nwe get it, or we do manual assignments.\n\n553\n00:28:46.861 --> 00:28:48.086\nIf I choose manual though,\n\n554\n00:28:48.086 --> 00:28:51.781\nyou'll notice everything here is pretty\nmuch the same as what we saw under IPV4.\n\n555\n00:28:51.781 --> 00:28:54.130\nThe address is gonna be really different.\n\n556\n00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:59.770\nSo if I come in and start to punch\nin whatever my address is gonna be,\n\n557\n00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:03.950\nI can punch that in and then my prefix.\n\n558\n00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:07.910\nWell the old subnet masks were\nreally denoting how many bits\n\n559\n00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:11.490\nof the address were part of\nthe network ID versus the host ID.\n\n560\n00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:15.160\nHere, you wouldn't want to write\n255.255.255.255.255, right, I mean\n\n561\n00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:20.540\nit would just go on and on and on,\nbecause the address is so long.\n\n562\n00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.450\nSo, instead,\nwe just write the prefix bits.\n\n563\n00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.853\nAnd most people just do a 64-bit prefix.\n\n564\n00:29:24.853 --> 00:29:26.000\nIt's 128-bit address.\n\n565\n00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.850\nSo the first half of\nthe address is the network ID,\n\n566\n00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.070\nthe second half is the host ID.\n\n567\n00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:34.050\nWe can afford to waste,\nbecause the address space is so big\n\n568\n00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:38.229\nthat this give us nice, huge networks to\nbe able to use inside of our environment.\n\n569\n00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.200\nAnd then your gateway is just\nthe router that you're gonna use.\n\n570\n00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.341\nMaybe it's the very first\ndevice in this network.\n\n571\n00:29:46.729 --> 00:29:48.189\nWhatever it is, you punch that in.\n\n572\n00:29:48.189 --> 00:29:51.510\nAnd then your name servers that you're\ngonna be doing lookups for, right?\n\n573\n00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:53.203\nSo whatever, whoops.\n\n574\n00:29:53.203 --> 00:29:56.000\n[LAUGH] Darn it.\n\n575\n00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.320\nWhatever network that happens to be\nif I can get my shortcut done here.\n\n576\n00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.480\nThere we go.\n\n577\n00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.830\nAll right, so I'll just punch that in.\n\n578\n00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.899\nAnd now I've got my name lookups,\nand I can provide multiples there.\n\n579\n00:30:09.899 --> 00:30:14.452\nGoogle, Level 3, those guys, they all\nhave IPv6 DNS servers that are out there.\n\n580\n00:30:14.452 --> 00:30:15.761\nYou might have your own,\nyou punch those in.\n\n581\n00:30:15.761 --> 00:30:18.630\nReally no different than IPv4.\n\n582\n00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.660\nYou get those configured,\nand they're in place.\n\n583\n00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.630\nNow, I do have to watch out, because\nRedHat does some interesting things.\n\n584\n00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:27.050\nSee how mine still says\nautomatic on here for DNS?\n\n585\n00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.490\nI'm manually entering DNS but\nit says automatic, and\n\n586\n00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:33.120\nthat means it's still going to try to\nlearn DNS servers from the network.\n\n587\n00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.120\nI'm overriding it, but\nit'll still learn those as backups.\n\n588\n00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.000\nI may or may not want that.\n\n589\n00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.150\nI can turn that off, and now it's only\ngoing to use the ones that I specify here.\n\n590\n00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:43.810\nOkay, so once we got that,\nnow we're good to go, I can apply that.\n\n591\n00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:48.610\nLet me reset that adapter, and\nonce it resets, I can see that\n\n592\n00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:53.020\nI've got my IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and\nI'm ready to rock and communicate on them.\n\n593\n00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.780\nNow I need to go update\nmy documentation to say,\n\n594\n00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.270\nDon just brought up this server,\nhere's the IP and so on.\n\n595\n00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:02.550\nAnd I need to verify on my DNS\nservers that I've got a proper mapping\n\n596\n00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:06.360\nin there that's mapping that host\nname to an IP so that, that's there.\n\n597\n00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.150\nAnd the reverse look up records,\nright, the PTRs.\n\n598\n00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.880\nYou need those for IPv4 and IPv6,\nso people can look at the address.\n\n599\n00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.240\nAnd figure out the name\nthat's attached to it.\n\n600\n00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.000\nThat's all an important\nstep of assigning an IP.\n\n601\n00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.580\nAll right, I've got a few more things\nthat I wanna talk about on here.\n\n602\n00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.200\nBut I know I'm short on time.\n\n603\n00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.375\nSo let's bump into a part two.\n\n604\n00:31:24.375 --> 00:31:26.640\nIt'll probably be a shorter one,\nbut we'll bump it to a part two.\n\n605\n00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.980\nAnd I just wanna wrap up a few more things\nwith setting up network adapters on\n\n606\n00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.470\nservers that we need to worry about.\n\n607\n00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:34.730\nBut we've kind of seen the bulk of what\nwe need to know for server plus and\n\n608\n00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:36.470\nwhat we need to know in real life.\n\n609\n00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:38.152\n&gt;&gt; A lot of great information there Don,\nand\n\n610\n00:31:38.152 --> 00:31:39.940\nwe definitely appreciate having you here.\n\n611\n00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.110\nAnd if any of this information that\nyou're looking at right now might seem\n\n612\n00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:46.770\nunfamiliar, keep in mind that we do have\nthe A plus and Net plus content that you\n\n613\n00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:49.730\ncan go back and watch and then join\nus back here in Server plus, Don.\n\n614\n00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:52.660\nBut before we sign out, do you have any\nadditional information you'd like to throw\n\n615\n00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.830\nin, we'll go ahead and\njust leave that for the part two.\n\n616\n00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:58.640\nThe most important part about IP\naddressing is good documentation, right?\n\n617\n00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.340\nYou don't wanna end up with duplicate IPs,\nso always keep track of that.\n\n618\n00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.890\nIf you're not good about keeping\na spreadsheet of IP addresses,\n\n619\n00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:06.020\nget third party software\nthat can track it.\n\n620\n00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:09.140\nYou just need to make sure you keep those\nstraight, it is an important piece.\n\n621\n00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.310\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, well as always,\nwe appreciate having you in the studios.\n\n622\n00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:14.030\nWe appreciate you, the viewer.\n\n623\n00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:16.860\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n624\n00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:17.804\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n625\n00:32:17.804 --> 00:32:19.953\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n626\n00:32:19.953 --> 00:32:26.120\n[MUSIC]\n\n627\n00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.000\nThank you for watching IT

00:00:12.290\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.904\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.904 --> 00:00:16.376\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:16.376 --> 00:00:19.340\nAnd in today's episode we're continuing\nthrough our series in Server+.\n\n7\n00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.220\nThat's right,\n\n8\n00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.020\nCompTIA Server+, coming back with a part\ntwo on IP addressing and services.\n\n9\n00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.780\nAnd joining us to help us round up this\ntopic is none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.820\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.910\nI'm doing just swell, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.820\nReady to dive right back in, and I rambled\non a little too long in the last episode.\n\n13\n00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.350\nI have a few more things to point out\nbefore we wrap up IP addressing and\n\n14\n00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.364\nthat's some of the services\nthat we need to focus on.\n\n15\n00:00:40.364 --> 00:00:42.963\nSo that's what we're gonna be picking\nup with right here in this episode.\n\n16\n00:00:42.963 --> 00:00:45.090\nIf you didn't watch part one,\nyou definitely wanna check it out.\n\n17\n00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.750\nBut when we set up a new server,\n\n18\n00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.802\none of the first things that we need to do\nis to get it communicating on the network.\n\n19\n00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:53.140\nIf you think about your\nstandard server setup, right,\n\n20\n00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.510\nyou gotta install the operating system and\nthen you need to do your updates.\n\n21\n00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.780\nUpdates are very,\nvery high up on the list of things to do.\n\n22\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.130\nWell, you usually need to be on\nthe network to do your updates,\n\n23\n00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.500\neven if you have a local update server.\n\n24\n00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.750\nSo that's why this is kind of a key and\ncritical step.\n\n25\n00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.501\nSo in the last episode,\nwe talked about assigning the addresses.\n\n26\n00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:12.006\nNow I wanna talk about some of the other\nthings we might need to configure on those\n\n27\n00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:15.530\nnetwork adapters to get them up and\nrunning and being happy.\n\n28\n00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.610\nNow, once we have an IP assigned, what\ndid we talk about in the last episode?\n\n29\n00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.989\nWe did IP address, we did subnet mask,\nwe did a default gateway or router, right.\n\n30\n00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:26.640\nDifferent operating systems\ncall it different things.\n\n31\n00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.360\nWe did a DNS server, potentially\na Win Server, although unlikely.\n\n32\n00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.630\nSo those are some of the components\nthat we've already seen.\n\n33\n00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.500\nNow I wanna talk about a few other\nthings we might need to worry about.\n\n34\n00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.360\nOne of the bigger ones is NAT and\nPAT, right, NAT and PAT.\n\n35\n00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.010\nNAT is network address translation.\n\n36\n00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.330\nWhen we assign an IP address to a server,\n\n37\n00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.160\nyour server might be connected\ndirectly to the Internet.\n\n38\n00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.260\nYou might have a full-blown public\nIP assigned to your server, and\n\n39\n00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.040\nit's exposed to the world, and off you go.\n\n40\n00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.630\nBut that's not terribly common.\n\n41\n00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.580\nIt's not common because of the security\nrisks that are just a part\n\n42\n00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.070\nof exposing a server like that.\n\n43\n00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.785\nSo, typically, you're gonna have a\nfirewall in-between you and the Internet.\n\n44\n00:02:08.785 --> 00:02:12.337\nIf that's the case, you might still\nhave a public IP on your server.\n\n45\n00:02:12.337 --> 00:02:16.523\nThe firewall is filtering and protecting\nyou as best it can, or an IDS box or\n\n46\n00:02:16.523 --> 00:02:19.719\nsomething like that,\nan intrusion detection service.\n\n47\n00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.684\nBut if you don't, what a lot of people\nwill do is they'll leverage a firewall\n\n48\n00:02:23.684 --> 00:02:28.263\nthat's connected to the Internet, and then\nthey'll use private IPs on their servers.\n\n49\n00:02:28.263 --> 00:02:31.826\nAnd if you have a private IP, you're\nnot allowed to talk to the Internet.\n\n50\n00:02:31.826 --> 00:02:35.321\nYour ISP is actually required to drop\ntraffic for private networks as soon as\n\n51\n00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.176\nthey hit the Internet, so\nyou're not even routed out there.\n\n52\n00:02:38.176 --> 00:02:40.570\nPrivate IPs aren't\nallowed to get out there.\n\n53\n00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.245\nSo we leverage a router, or\na firewall that's acting as a router,\n\n54\n00:02:44.245 --> 00:02:47.270\nto perform network address translation.\n\n55\n00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.850\nAnd with NAT,\n\n56\n00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.420\nnetwork address translation, we're\nchanging that private IP into a public IP.\n\n57\n00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.610\nNow, when you do that, it can be\na one-to-one mapping or a one-to-many.\n\n58\n00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.380\nIf you think about the home routers\nthat people use, you might have 10 or\n\n59\n00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.990\n15 devices in your house.\n\n60\n00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.240\nAnd they all share one public IP address\non their way out to the Internet.\n\n61\n00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.070\nAnd that's fine for a home.\n\n62\n00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.370\nBut if I have five web servers, and\nthey're all running on port 80,\n\n63\n00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.210\nand they all share one IP,\nhow is that gonna work out?\n\n64\n00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.880\nIt's not, right, I can't do that.\n\n65\n00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.890\nSo in that scenario,\nI need to have one IP for each device.\n\n66\n00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.991\nThat way, they each get their own and they\ncan all use the same port number if they\n\n67\n00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:31.220\nwant, I can have five\ndifferent web servers.\n\n68\n00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.770\nAnd we do a one-to-one mapping,\nwe map a public IP to a private IP.\n\n69\n00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.458\nWhen that happens, the server only\nknows about its private IP, so\n\n70\n00:03:39.458 --> 00:03:42.585\nwhen it browses out to the Internet or\nwhatever, it's getting translated.\n\n71\n00:03:42.585 --> 00:03:45.553\nAnd that's kind of what's happening\nto my Linux server that I stood up\n\n72\n00:03:45.553 --> 00:03:46.468\nin the last episode.\n\n73\n00:03:46.468 --> 00:03:49.584\nIf we take a look at my\nconfiguration on this one,\n\n74\n00:03:49.584 --> 00:03:53.081\nI gave mine an address of 10.0.222.101.\n\n75\n00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:54.425\nThat's my address.\n\n76\n00:03:54.425 --> 00:03:58.769\nWhen I go out to the Internet,\nI can't because I start with a 10, and\n\n77\n00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.270\nthat's an RFC 1918, or a private address.\n\n78\n00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.400\nSo I've gotta get translated.\n\n79\n00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.610\nIf you've got a firewall in place,\nor a router,\n\n80\n00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.437\nit's likely already doing this for you.\n\n81\n00:04:08.437 --> 00:04:13.806\nAnd if I go and\nbrowse to a site like showmemy.info,\n\n82\n00:04:13.806 --> 00:04:18.571\nI can see what the Internet\nsees as my address.\n\n83\n00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:23.189\nAnd my address is showing is 66.249.88.51.\n\n84\n00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:25.510\nBut that's not what's\nassigned to my server.\n\n85\n00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.548\nThat's because the firewall\nchanged my address on the way out.\n\n86\n00:04:28.548 --> 00:04:30.263\nThat's network address translation.\n\n87\n00:04:30.263 --> 00:04:32.520\nNow, why do I bring that up here?\n\n88\n00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.600\nI bring it up here because of two reasons.\n\n89\n00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.070\nOne, if I didn't have this, I wouldn't\nbe able to communicate to the Internet.\n\n90\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.920\nSo there's more than just\nassigning an IP to your server.\n\n91\n00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.816\nYou've gotta make sure that you've\ngot the infrastructure in place\n\n92\n00:04:42.816 --> 00:04:44.220\nto communicate out.\n\n93\n00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.330\nThe other reason is if I want to do\na one-to-one mapping, where I map\n\n94\n00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.000\na public IP to a private IP, that's got to\nbe done on the firewall or on the router.\n\n95\n00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.560\nThat's where it's got to be set up.\n\n96\n00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.230\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don, if you're doing,\nlike you're saying,\n\n97\n00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.660\na one-to-one mapping, and let's say I\nhave ten devices on my internal network,\n\n98\n00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.310\nthey're all using those non-routable\naddresses, does that mean I have to have\n\n99\n00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.090\nten public IP addresses if it's\na one-to-one mapping like that?\n\n100\n00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.615\nYes, yeah, you really do.\n\n101\n00:05:13.615 --> 00:05:17.635\nIf I'm gonna have ten servers, and\nI want them all to have a public IP,\n\n102\n00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:21.536\nI need to call up my ISP and\nI need to say, hey, I need ten public IPs.\n\n103\n00:05:21.536 --> 00:05:22.790\nAnd they'll give you the ten.\n\n104\n00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.840\nAnd you could opt to put those ten\nIPs right on your machines and\n\n105\n00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.370\nexpose them to Internet.\n\n106\n00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.401\nOr you could opt to do\nthe one-to-one mappings.\n\n107\n00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:32.150\nNow, what's the difference?\n\n108\n00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.773\nYou can have a firewall in-between in\neither model, so why not just go ahead and\n\n109\n00:05:34.773 --> 00:05:36.390\nassign them a public IP?\n\n110\n00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.660\nWell, sometimes it's beneficial to have\nthe private IP because you can always\n\n111\n00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.850\nchange the mapping to\npoint somewhere else.\n\n112\n00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.700\nWhen it comes to time\nto upgrade that server,\n\n113\n00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.610\nI can bring up a whole new server\nwith a different internal IP.\n\n114\n00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.360\nSo they can both be up and\nrunning at the same time.\n\n115\n00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.140\nAnd when I get the new server all set\nup just the way I want, I can go and\n\n116\n00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.930\nchange the mapping and\npoint it to the new server.\n\n117\n00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.870\nAnd now it's done, right.\n\n118\n00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.630\nSo it makes it very easy to move\nthe IP from one location to another.\n\n119\n00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.490\nWe can also have that IP\npoint to a load balancer.\n\n120\n00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.320\nI might have 50 servers and\njust one IP, and\n\n121\n00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.250\nI'm load balancing that traffic across\nthe 50 servers on the back end.\n\n122\n00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.380\nYou can do that, too.\n\n123\n00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.350\nNot if you assign the IP\ndirectly to the host, but\n\n124\n00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.660\nif you assign the IP to a one- to-one\nmapping and use private IPs on the inside.\n\n125\n00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.440\nSo it opens you up to a lot of options.\n\n126\n00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.700\nAnd so that's why I generally\nprefer to do it that way,\n\n127\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.270\nwhere you've got one-to-one mappings.\n\n128\n00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.645\nIt does mean you've gotta go and\nmanually enter them in.\n\n129\n00:06:26.645 --> 00:06:28.076\nBut if you were doing static assignments,\n\n130\n00:06:28.076 --> 00:06:29.834\nyou'd have to manually\nenter them in there anyway.\n\n131\n00:06:29.834 --> 00:06:32.128\nSo it's not really that much more work,\nand\n\n132\n00:06:32.128 --> 00:06:35.260\nthe benefit that you get from\nit is typically worth it.\n\n133\n00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.470\nSo that's the way that we\nnormally wanna run on that.\n\n134\n00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.890\nSo that's a key thing.\n\n135\n00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.870\nI do wanna talk a little\nbit more about PAT, though.\n\n136\n00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.180\nPAT is port address translation.\n\n137\n00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.590\nWhen you're doing a one-to-one mapping,\n\n138\n00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.640\nyou have one internal host\ntied to one public IP.\n\n139\n00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.800\nWe don't have to worry about\nthings like port numbers because\n\n140\n00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.330\nyou have exclusive access to that IP.\n\n141\n00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.880\nBut when you have multiple\nmachines sharing the same IP,\n\n142\n00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.450\nlike what you see on a home router,\n\n143\n00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.440\nyou don't have exclusive access to\nthe IP anymore, you gotta share it.\n\n144\n00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.790\nSo if Wes and I are being NATted behind\nthe same IP, and he brings up a web server\n\n145\n00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:16.080\non port 80 and I bring up a web server on\nport 80, we can't both work on port 80.\n\n146\n00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.336\nIncoming traffic on port 80\nis gonna go to either him or\n\n147\n00:07:19.336 --> 00:07:21.497\nme, it's not gonna go to both of us.\n\n148\n00:07:21.497 --> 00:07:24.356\nSo one of us might work now,\nthe other one might work later.\n\n149\n00:07:24.356 --> 00:07:26.038\nIt's gonna go back and forth,\nit's not gonna be consistent,\n\n150\n00:07:26.038 --> 00:07:27.580\nit's not gonna function.\n\n151\n00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.153\nSo in those scenarios,\n\n152\n00:07:29.153 --> 00:07:32.750\nyou'll have to leverage what's\ncalled port address translation.\n\n153\n00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.990\nAnd that's where,\nnot only do you change the address, but\n\n154\n00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.140\nyou change the port number also.\n\n155\n00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.250\nMost home routers do this automatically.\n\n156\n00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.460\nBut when you get to higher end devices,\nlike Cisco ASA firewalls and\n\n157\n00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.660\nstuff, they typically don't do port\naddress translation unless you\n\n158\n00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.420\ntell them to, right.\n\n159\n00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.062\nCisco calls it overload.\n\n160\n00:07:49.062 --> 00:07:52.620\nThey have this overload option you\ncan turn on that tells it to do that.\n\n161\n00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.382\nCisco assumes that you're doing one-to-one\nmappings, right, or that you're creating\n\n162\n00:07:56.382 --> 00:07:59.142\na pool that's available,\na dynamic pool, that you can draw from.\n\n163\n00:07:59.142 --> 00:08:01.139\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don,\nthat seems like in the home network,\n\n164\n00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:03.930\nthe port address translation would\nbe a little bit more efficient.\n\n165\n00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.909\nCuz I can think of my home network right\nnow and I I think the last time I checked\n\n166\n00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:09.299\nmy router's interface,\nI had like ten devices connected.\n\n167\n00:08:09.299 --> 00:08:12.212\nAnd I certainly wouldn't wanna\nhave to go to an ISP and\n\n168\n00:08:12.212 --> 00:08:15.125\nlease an IP address just to\nlet my cell phone connect,\n\n169\n00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:19.460\nmaybe not through the cellular network,\nbut through my Wi-Fi network.\n\n170\n00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.230\n&gt;&gt; Right, and when you're talking\nabout outbound connections,\n\n171\n00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:27.630\nwhen we connect to a system outbound,\nyou use any number of ports, right?\n\n172\n00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:32.071\nCuz the port numbers,\nthey run from 1 to 65,535.\n\n173\n00:08:32.071 --> 00:08:36.288\nAnd the upper block, it's like 49,000 and\nsomething all the way to 65,000 and\n\n174\n00:08:36.288 --> 00:08:40.396\nsomething, so it's a good chunk of 15,000\nport numbers, those are available for\n\n175\n00:08:40.396 --> 00:08:41.074\ndynamic use.\n\n176\n00:08:41.074 --> 00:08:42.970\nYou just grab one on your way out.\n\n177\n00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.940\nAnd so on the way out, people don't\nreally care what their port number is.\n\n178\n00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.370\nIt's the destination, the way in, right?\n\n179\n00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.548\nWhen you're coming to the server,\nit expects web traffic to be on port 80,\n\n180\n00:08:52.548 --> 00:08:56.173\nit expects FTP traffic to be on port 21,\nor SSH to be on port 22.\n\n181\n00:08:56.173 --> 00:08:58.521\nIt expects that, right,\nat the server side.\n\n182\n00:08:58.521 --> 00:09:02.125\nSo when you're on your cell phone or\nyour laptop or your desktop,\n\n183\n00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:03.901\nwe're fine with sharing an IP.\n\n184\n00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:06.416\nCuz we're going out,\nwe're connecting to other people.\n\n185\n00:09:06.416 --> 00:09:08.056\nBut when you're a server,\n\n186\n00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:12.063\nyou're expecting that traffic to\ncome in on one particular port.\n\n187\n00:09:12.063 --> 00:09:14.330\nAnd when that doesn't happen,\nit causes problems.\n\n188\n00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.850\nAnd so that's where you might\nneed to leverage something\n\n189\n00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.240\nlike a one-to-one mapping,\ncuz now you have access to those ports,\n\n190\n00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.260\nand you don't have to worry about\nconflicting with other people.\n\n191\n00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.789\nSo just be aware that that's not something\nthat you configure on the server itself,\n\n192\n00:09:25.789 --> 00:09:28.870\nit's something that you configure in your\nnetwork infrastructure that you can put in\n\n193\n00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:33.462\nplace and it affects the way you\ncommunicate out to the network, all right?\n\n194\n00:09:33.462 --> 00:09:36.330\nI see this a lot with Amazon Web Services,\nright?\n\n195\n00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.820\nSo of you go into AWS and\nyou spin up a server in EC2,\n\n196\n00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:44.730\nit used to be that you got a public\nIP right there on the server.\n\n197\n00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.200\nIt's not like that anymore.\n\n198\n00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.710\nNow you set up these\nVirtual Private Containers, these VPCs.\n\n199\n00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:54.692\nAnd inside of them, it'll use a 172.16 or\nall the way through 31,\n\n200\n00:09:54.692 --> 00:09:57.160\none of those private IP ranges.\n\n201\n00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.630\nAnd they do a one-to-one mapping right\nthere inside of that cloud infrastructure.\n\n202\n00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.799\nSo you see it all over the place now,\nand it's pretty common.\n\n203\n00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.554\nAll right, another thing to think\nabout is our MAC address, right?\n\n204\n00:10:08.554 --> 00:10:11.480\nWhen I say a MAC address,\nI'm not talking about Mac like Macintosh.\n\n205\n00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.340\nI'm talking about a media\naccess control address.\n\n206\n00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.530\nIf I take a look at my Linux box here,\nlet me just bring this one back up, and\n\n207\n00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:19.469\ngo into my settings.\n\n208\n00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.440\nAnd go under my Details.\n\n209\n00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:29.793\nYou can see this Hardware Address, right,\nmine's 00:0C:29:4A:03:AB, all right.\n\n210\n00:10:29.793 --> 00:10:37.010\nThat is a 48 bit hexadecimal number that's\nbeen burned into my network adapter.\n\n211\n00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.860\nWhen they manufacture network adapters,\nthey burn these addresses in.\n\n212\n00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.580\nAnd in theory they're globally unique.\n\n213\n00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.090\nIn other words, there shouldn't be a\nnetwork adapter anywhere else in the world\n\n214\n00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.250\nthat has this same address.\n\n215\n00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:53.542\nNow, the way they achieve that, is the\nfirst three values here, for me 00:0C:29,\n\n216\n00:10:53.542 --> 00:10:58.707\nthat's the OID, that identifies\nwhoever the manufacturer was, right?\n\n217\n00:10:58.707 --> 00:11:02.160\nI think I've got an Intel adapter here,\nso that'll map back to Intel.\n\n218\n00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.433\nAnd then the last three values,\nin my case,\n\n219\n00:11:05.433 --> 00:11:10.730\n4A:03:AB, identifies this\nparticular network adapter.\n\n220\n00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.770\nSo if I buy five Intel network adapters,\n\n221\n00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.230\nthey might all have the same\nfirst three values.\n\n222\n00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.730\nBut then they'll have different values for\nthe last three.\n\n223\n00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.074\nSo they're unique, right?\n\n224\n00:11:20.074 --> 00:11:23.462\nAnd if I buy cards from Intel and\ncards from Broadcom and\n\n225\n00:11:23.462 --> 00:11:27.270\ncards from whoever else,\nthey'll have different OIDs.\n\n226\n00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.352\nSo they won't match,\njust because of the different vendors.\n\n227\n00:11:30.352 --> 00:11:35.790\nSo these MAC addresses are how machines\ncommunicate to their next hop for\n\n228\n00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.200\ntheir local connections.\n\n229\n00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.140\nIf I wanna talk to Wes' laptop\nright here beside me on the table,\n\n230\n00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.480\nwe're gonna use these\nMAC addresses to talk.\n\n231\n00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.222\nThat's a layer two address.\n\n232\n00:11:44.222 --> 00:11:47.891\nWe have layer three addresses that helps\nus figure out whether we're on the same\n\n233\n00:11:47.891 --> 00:11:48.393\nnetwork.\n\n234\n00:11:48.393 --> 00:11:51.446\nBut we use the layer two\naddress to actually talk.\n\n235\n00:11:51.446 --> 00:11:54.896\nIf I'm talking to somebody out on the\nInternet, I need to go through a router,\n\n236\n00:11:54.896 --> 00:11:57.428\nand I'll use the layer two\naddress to talk to the router.\n\n237\n00:11:57.428 --> 00:11:59.958\nNow, the nice thing about these is\nthey're burned in your adapter, so\n\n238\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.278\nyou don't have to worry about them.\n\n239\n00:12:01.278 --> 00:12:04.450\nThey're just already set,\nit's not like I have to set them.\n\n240\n00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.510\nAnd they're not routable,\n\n241\n00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.540\nthey only let you talk to somebody\nright there on the same network as you.\n\n242\n00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.490\nSo there's no subnets to worry about,\nor route statements or\n\n243\n00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:14.240\nanything, it's just,\nyou see them on the same link as you.\n\n244\n00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.838\nWhen you configure a server,\n\n245\n00:12:16.838 --> 00:12:19.438\nit's not normally something\nyou have to worry about.\n\n246\n00:12:19.438 --> 00:12:21.718\nOne time, in my entire IT career,\n\n247\n00:12:21.718 --> 00:12:27.140\nhave I seen two physical adapters that\nactually had the same MAC address.\n\n248\n00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.400\nAnd what happens when you do that\nis that any traffic destined for\n\n249\n00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.600\nthat MAC address ends up being\ndelivered to both hosts.\n\n250\n00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.492\nAnd so you end up losing a lot\nof bandwidth on those hosts and\n\n251\n00:12:36.492 --> 00:12:39.100\nyou get some erratic behaviors,\nit's kind of an odd situation.\n\n252\n00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.370\nIt's extremely rare that it occurs,\nand it really shouldn't ever happen.\n\n253\n00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.665\nYou should never have two adapters\nwith the same MAC address.\n\n254\n00:12:45.665 --> 00:12:50.940\nUnfortunately, we don't use as many\nphysical adapters as we used to.\n\n255\n00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.180\nNow we virtualize everything.\n\n256\n00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.680\nAnd when you virtualize, yeah,\n\n257\n00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.055\nyou've got a physical adapter under\nthe hood that's tied to the host, but\n\n258\n00:12:58.055 --> 00:13:00.805\nyour virtual machines will\nhave virtual network adapters.\n\n259\n00:13:00.805 --> 00:13:05.240\nAnd those virtual network adapters\nhave to make up a MAC address.\n\n260\n00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.770\nAnd so when they do,\nthey've got on OID, right?\n\n261\n00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:15.120\nThey've got a vendor assigned to them\nthat we map to VMware or Parallels or\n\n262\n00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.980\nwhoever it is, Citrix, whoever is it\nthat made your virtualization software.\n\n263\n00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.182\nBut the remainder of that\naddress is being made up.\n\n264\n00:13:22.182 --> 00:13:27.950\nAnd it's not uncommon to get two virtual\nservers that have the same MAC address,\n\n265\n00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.510\nand that can really wreak havoc.\n\n266\n00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.240\nSo what I encourage most companies to do\n\n267\n00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.130\nis statically assign MAC\naddresses on virtual machines.\n\n268\n00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:35.940\nIt's not hard to do.\n\n269\n00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.600\nYou can come in and punch them in.\n\n270\n00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.520\nAnd keep track of,\nI usually use this value right here.\n\n271\n00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:46.030\nSo the first set of three here, that's\ngonna identify this as a virtual MAC\n\n272\n00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.450\naddress, it's tied to Microsoft or\nHyper-V, right?\n\n273\n00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:54.330\nAnd then I'll use the second one\nhere to identify the server, and\n\n274\n00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.700\nthen the other two to\nidentify the virtual machine.\n\n275\n00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.280\nAnd so\nthat way you can kinda keep track of it,\n\n276\n00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.024\nlike you keep track of IPs, and make sure\nthat you don't end up with duplicates\n\n277\n00:14:01.024 --> 00:14:02.450\nanywhere in your environment, right.\n\n278\n00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.180\nBut it can happen.\n\n279\n00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.320\nNow, most operating systems\nwon't allow you to change it.\n\n280\n00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.600\nSo as I'm in here,\nI'm in my Linux box, and\n\n281\n00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.240\nas far as it's concerned,\nthat address is set, right?\n\n282\n00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.398\nWell, if they have the virtualization\nfeatures installed,\n\n283\n00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:19.490\nthey'll allow you to override it.\n\n284\n00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:23.044\nAnd overriding a MAC address is a tool\nthat a lot of hackers use to perform man\n\n285\n00:14:23.044 --> 00:14:25.316\nin the middle attacks and\nmasquerade attacks.\n\n286\n00:14:25.316 --> 00:14:30.058\nSo it's not necessarily something that\na normal user's gonna make use of, but\n\n287\n00:14:30.058 --> 00:14:31.630\non virtual servers it is.\n\n288\n00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.096\nAnd you'll see right here,\nI know this is a virtual adapter,\n\n289\n00:14:35.096 --> 00:14:37.490\ncuz the eno number is way up there.\n\n290\n00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:42.150\nNormally, on a Red Hat box, if I had\na physical adapter, I would have eno1,\n\n291\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:46.830\neno2, eno3, right, for\nmy Ethernet adapters, and each number.\n\n292\n00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:52.016\nBut in this case, I've got eno16777736\nbecause it's a virtual adapter,\n\n293\n00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:54.324\nso it assigned a high number to it.\n\n294\n00:14:54.324 --> 00:14:58.356\nSo since it's a virtual adapter,\nI could override that address.\n\n295\n00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:01.168\nAnd here it's showing me the actual\naddress of this adapter, or\n\n296\n00:15:01.168 --> 00:15:02.060\nI could type one in.\n\n297\n00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.170\nNow, why would I wanna type one in\nhere if it was a physical server?\n\n298\n00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.875\nWell, I might be replacing a old\nserver with a new server, and\n\n299\n00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:11.125\nI might have a lot of stuff\ntied to that MAC address.\n\n300\n00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:14.064\nI might have DHCP reservations,\nor software licenses, or\n\n301\n00:15:14.064 --> 00:15:16.021\nother things tied to that MAC address.\n\n302\n00:15:16.021 --> 00:15:20.480\nSo I might want to preserve that MAC\naddress when I move it over here, right?\n\n303\n00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.182\nOr I might have a one-to-one NAT mapping\nwhere the public IP has a certain MAC tied\n\n304\n00:15:25.182 --> 00:15:27.512\nto it, and I wanna mirror that MAC here.\n\n305\n00:15:27.512 --> 00:15:30.514\nUsually it's the other way around, I\nwanna mirror this MAC on the net mapping.\n\n306\n00:15:30.514 --> 00:15:33.178\nBut you can go in and\nspecify that and override it.\n\n307\n00:15:33.178 --> 00:15:40.466\nSo I could type in an address if I wanted,\nwhatever that happens to be.\n\n308\n00:15:40.466 --> 00:15:45.006\nAnd now I know that MAC Address is set and\nit'll be a part of that adapter.\n\n309\n00:15:45.006 --> 00:15:48.589\nJust be careful with this,\non a physical adapter, it's burned in, so\n\n310\n00:15:48.589 --> 00:15:51.696\nit's still gonna function,\nit's still gonna be there, but\n\n311\n00:15:51.696 --> 00:15:55.602\nyou'll have this additional MAC address\ntied to the adapter tied to this IP.\n\n312\n00:15:55.602 --> 00:15:59.209\nIf you have more than one IP, potentially\nyou could have more than one MAC address\n\n313\n00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:01.240\ntied to the same adapter,\nthat is Possible.\n\n314\n00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.032\nEspecially if you're doing things\nlike load balancing across adapters.\n\n315\n00:16:04.032 --> 00:16:06.946\nThey'll create a virtual MAC Address\nthat's shared across the adapters.\n\n316\n00:16:06.946 --> 00:16:08.885\nThat is part of NIC teaming.\n\n317\n00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:11.964\nNIC teaming is network\ninterface card teaming.\n\n318\n00:16:11.964 --> 00:16:14.641\nI'm gonna have two adapters or\nthree or four adapters, right?\n\n319\n00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:19.042\nMost servers have at least two network\nadapters in them, some have four.\n\n320\n00:16:19.042 --> 00:16:21.990\nAnd you can take those and\nbond them together.\n\n321\n00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:25.250\nSo, instead of having two gigabit\nadapters, I can bond them and\n\n322\n00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:29.780\nnow I've got one two gigabit adapter,\nor one four gigabit adopter.\n\n323\n00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.590\nIf I’m bonding multiple bonds,\nmaybe I’ve got ten gigabit adapters.\n\n324\n00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:34.926\nAnd so, I take four of those and\nbond them.\n\n325\n00:16:34.926 --> 00:16:37.519\nAnd now I've got a 40 gigabit\nconnection coming out of my server.\n\n326\n00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:38.479\nAnd you can do it, right?\n\n327\n00:16:38.479 --> 00:16:42.559\nBut in order to load balance traffic\nacross all those interfaces they've\n\n328\n00:16:42.559 --> 00:16:44.417\ngotta have a common MAC address.\n\n329\n00:16:44.417 --> 00:16:48.446\nAnd so it will generate a MAC address like\nkind of what I'm doing here, typing one,\n\n330\n00:16:48.446 --> 00:16:50.760\nand share it across those interfaces.\n\n331\n00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.475\nSo now I've got five MAC addresses.\n\n332\n00:16:52.475 --> 00:16:53.865\nOne for each network adapter and\n\n333\n00:16:53.865 --> 00:16:57.325\nthen one virtual one that's shared\nacross the different interfaces, right?\n\n334\n00:16:57.325 --> 00:16:58.872\nSo that's a part of NIC teaming.\n\n335\n00:16:58.872 --> 00:17:02.087\nAnd a lot of operating\nsystems have that built in.\n\n336\n00:17:02.087 --> 00:17:04.131\nBut also your network drivers,\n\n337\n00:17:04.131 --> 00:17:08.910\nIntel has a teaming suite that you can\ninstall that lets you balance it too.\n\n338\n00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:11.279\nAll right, and you see I've got\na Cloned Address option here.\n\n339\n00:17:11.279 --> 00:17:14.542\nThis would be really if I was using\nthis Linux server as a router.\n\n340\n00:17:14.542 --> 00:17:16.178\nAnd I wanted to take\nsome internal host and\n\n341\n00:17:16.178 --> 00:17:18.012\nmirror its MAC address\nto another interface.\n\n342\n00:17:18.012 --> 00:17:20.192\nYou see that when you're\nusing cable modems.\n\n343\n00:17:20.192 --> 00:17:22.981\nIn an enterprise environment we\ndon't necessarily have to make\n\n344\n00:17:22.981 --> 00:17:23.866\nuse of that so much.\n\n345\n00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:32.512\nAll right, now, I'm looking at this\nhere on kind of a virtual machine side.\n\n346\n00:17:32.512 --> 00:17:34.055\nFrom the host you can do it too.\n\n347\n00:17:34.055 --> 00:17:39.630\nSo for example, I'm running this as\na virtual machine inside of VMware Fusion.\n\n348\n00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:45.640\nAnd if I go into VMware Fusion,\nI can go into my network adapter settings.\n\n349\n00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.520\nAnd see here where I've got\nkind of how it's being set?\n\n350\n00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.454\nIt's asking what adapter\nI wanna connect to.\n\n351\n00:17:50.454 --> 00:17:54.792\nBut if I scroll down,\nI can get to the MAC address settings.\n\n352\n00:17:54.792 --> 00:17:59.092\nIn VMWare, VSphere or ESX,\nin Microsoft HyperV, in Zen Server, KVM,\n\n353\n00:17:59.092 --> 00:18:03.058\nin all the different virtualization\nproducts that are out there.\n\n354\n00:18:03.058 --> 00:18:06.690\nThe network adapters are synthetic,\nthey're virtual network adapters.\n\n355\n00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.180\nThey're not physical network adapters.\n\n356\n00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.750\nAnd so, you can go in and\noverride that MAC address.\n\n357\n00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.038\nAnd the operating system will\njust see it as part of that.\n\n358\n00:18:13.038 --> 00:18:15.920\nSo, if you have an operating system that\nwon't let you change the MAC address.\n\n359\n00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.225\nJust change it in the virtualization\nlayer that you're using.\n\n360\n00:18:18.225 --> 00:18:20.608\nThe only place that doesn't work is\nwhen you're on a physical server,\n\n361\n00:18:20.608 --> 00:18:21.811\nif you're not on a virtual server.\n\n362\n00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:25.548\nIf you're on a physical server your\nnetwork adapter has to support having\n\n363\n00:18:25.548 --> 00:18:28.153\nthe MAC address changed,\nand a lot of them don't.\n\n364\n00:18:28.153 --> 00:18:30.401\nA lot of them don't support that.\n\n365\n00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:35.873\nSo the way to work around that is you can\ncreate a bridge on the network adapter.\n\n366\n00:18:35.873 --> 00:18:39.220\nAnd a bridge is a virtual interface\nthat's tied to a physical adapter.\n\n367\n00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.108\nAnd the bridge,\nyou can adjust the MAC address on.\n\n368\n00:18:41.108 --> 00:18:43.580\nSo there are ways to work around\nit on any system if you want.\n\n369\n00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.112\nAll right, so that's our MAC address,\n\n370\n00:18:47.112 --> 00:18:50.060\nkind of the situation where we\nmight need to mess with that.\n\n371\n00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.570\nLet's see, what else do I have mention?\n\n372\n00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.390\nI think we're kind of winding down.\n\n373\n00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:55.000\nAnother important concept.\n\n374\n00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.804\nWhen we set up a network adapter,\nnotice mine says that I'm Connected,\n\n375\n00:18:59.804 --> 00:19:03.365\nand it's 1000 Mb/s,\nit's a gigabit adapter.\n\n376\n00:19:03.365 --> 00:19:08.296\nMost adapters when you buy them,\nthey'll say 10, 100, 1000.\n\n377\n00:19:08.296 --> 00:19:12.287\nOr, 10,000, or whatever,\nthey'll tell you the speed of the adapter.\n\n378\n00:19:12.287 --> 00:19:15.784\nNow when they say something like 10,\n100, and 1000,\n\n379\n00:19:15.784 --> 00:19:18.522\nthat means they support\nauto negotiating speed.\n\n380\n00:19:18.522 --> 00:19:19.870\nWhen you plug a network cable in,\n\n381\n00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.900\nit's gonna figure out what\nspeed the network is.\n\n382\n00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.497\nIf it's a gigabit network,\nit'll run at a gigabit.\n\n383\n00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:27.310\nBut if it's a 10 megabit network,\nit'll drop down and run at 10 megabit.\n\n384\n00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.726\nUsually we don't have to worry about that.\n\n385\n00:19:29.726 --> 00:19:31.719\nIn a workstation we\nnever worry about that.\n\n386\n00:19:31.719 --> 00:19:34.263\nBut in a server,\nyou need to worry about it.\n\n387\n00:19:34.263 --> 00:19:37.668\nBecause sometimes that auto\nnegotiation doesn't work out so well.\n\n388\n00:19:37.668 --> 00:19:44.144\nThere are numerous cases where\nHP Procurve and Cisco Catalyst switches.\n\n389\n00:19:44.144 --> 00:19:47.579\nDon't properly auto negotiate with\nthe operating systems that are out there.\n\n390\n00:19:47.579 --> 00:19:51.989\nAnd so I might have a gigabit capable\nnetwork plugged into a gigabit capable\n\n391\n00:19:51.989 --> 00:19:52.559\nswitch.\n\n392\n00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:54.955\nAnd for some reason, I negotiate 100 Mb.\n\n393\n00:19:54.955 --> 00:19:58.420\nAgain on a workstation,\nI really wouldn't care.\n\n394\n00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.490\nBut on a server, I would.\n\n395\n00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.530\nAnd so\nyou may need to override those settings.\n\n396\n00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:03.770\nYou need to be aware of it.\n\n397\n00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.010\nSome operating systems expose it,\nsome systems don't.\n\n398\n00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:11.290\nYou'll notice here in Red Hat they don't\ngive me the option to override that speed.\n\n399\n00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.990\nEven if I jump into my\nsettings in here and\n\n400\n00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.440\nstart looking where we can\nset our hardware information.\n\n401\n00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.210\nI can adjust an MTU but\nI can't adjust a speed.\n\n402\n00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.330\nI'd have to drop down into the config\nfiles for the interface and\n\n403\n00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:23.730\noverride it there.\n\n404\n00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.760\nOther operating systems like Microsoft.\n\n405\n00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.720\nSo here I'm in Windows Server 2012.\n\n406\n00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.090\nIf I jump into my network\nadapter settings.\n\n407\n00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.940\nI'm gonna pull up Ethernet0.\n\n408\n00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.710\nAnd go into my settings.\n\n409\n00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:39.970\nIf I jump into TCP/IP,\nI'm only gonna see the IP stuff.\n\n410\n00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.870\nBut up top here,\nI've got the physical network adapter.\n\n411\n00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.080\nAnd I can hit Configure and\n\n412\n00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:50.590\nit'll take me into the physical\nnetwork adapter settings.\n\n413\n00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:53.510\nAnd here you'll see usually\ndriver information.\n\n414\n00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.270\nI mean, at first look, it doesn't\nlook like we can change anything.\n\n415\n00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:59.077\nBut as you move through you'll find\nwhere you can actually change quite\n\n416\n00:20:59.077 --> 00:20:59.743\na bit of things.\n\n417\n00:20:59.743 --> 00:21:03.175\nAnd when you look down this list,\nyou can spot in here\n\n418\n00:21:03.175 --> 00:21:07.951\nwhere it will give you the option to\nchange speeds or duplex or whatever.\n\n419\n00:21:07.951 --> 00:21:12.420\nOkay, now, as you look at it, some\nadapters support different settings, and\n\n420\n00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.740\nyou've gotta kind of pay attention.\n\n421\n00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.400\nI may have a feature here that you don't,\nand you may have features that I don't.\n\n422\n00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.900\nIt's up to the driver, whoever wrote\nthat driver for that particular adapter.\n\n423\n00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.101\nWhen we're talking about gigabit,\ngigabit is really nice.\n\n424\n00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:26.835\nBecause gigabit only runs in full duplex.\n\n425\n00:21:26.835 --> 00:21:30.083\nAnd I haven't really\nmentioned duplex too much.\n\n426\n00:21:30.083 --> 00:21:35.970\nNetwork adapters connect usually via\nCategory 5 or Category 6 cabling.\n\n427\n00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:39.010\nAnd that cabling has\neight wires inside of it.\n\n428\n00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:42.630\nWhen you're running in 100 megabit,\nyou only use four of the wires.\n\n429\n00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:46.570\nWhen you're running in gigabit you use\nall eight wires inside of that cable.\n\n430\n00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:50.738\nAnd when you're running either one\nyou can be sending traffic and\n\n431\n00:21:50.738 --> 00:21:52.715\nyou can be receiving traffic.\n\n432\n00:21:52.715 --> 00:21:56.643\nWhen you're in half duplex mode you can\nonly send or receive at any given time.\n\n433\n00:21:56.643 --> 00:21:57.804\nYou can't do both at the same time.\n\n434\n00:21:57.804 --> 00:21:59.233\nSo if I'm sending right now.\n\n435\n00:21:59.233 --> 00:22:02.317\nAnybody who's trying to\ncommunicate to me has to wait for\n\n436\n00:22:02.317 --> 00:22:06.140\nme to finish sending before I can\nreceive what they're sending.\n\n437\n00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.040\nSo it's slower just\nbecause we have to wait.\n\n438\n00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.280\nIn full duplex, we can be sending and\nreceiving at the same time.\n\n439\n00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.970\nEvery modern network adapter can do it.\n\n440\n00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.874\nEvery network adapter made in the last\nten years can absolutely do it.\n\n441\n00:22:17.874 --> 00:22:21.414\nBut, when you plug into that switch,\nyou auto-negotiate.\n\n442\n00:22:21.414 --> 00:22:25.330\nAnd the switch may not negotiate\nthe right settings for you.\n\n443\n00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:29.076\nYou might negotiate something that\nis half duplex instead of full.\n\n444\n00:22:29.076 --> 00:22:33.181\nAnd in those scenarios, it's best to\ngo into your network adapter settings.\n\n445\n00:22:33.181 --> 00:22:37.263\nAnd change that to manually assign\nwhat you want that speed to be.\n\n446\n00:22:37.263 --> 00:22:40.330\nTo manually assign what you\nwant that duplex to be.\n\n447\n00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.110\nDon't let auto detect do it for\nyou, manually set it.\n\n448\n00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.510\nI always recommend this on servers.\n\n449\n00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:45.280\nOn work stations?\n\n450\n00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.770\nNo, it's too much of a hassle.\n\n451\n00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.708\nBut on a server, manually set it.\n\n452\n00:22:48.708 --> 00:22:54.008\nAnd looking at this one kind\nof as I go down the list here.\n\n453\n00:22:54.008 --> 00:22:57.949\nWe've got a Gigabit Master Slave Mode\nis just set to Auto Detect.\n\n454\n00:22:57.949 --> 00:22:59.865\nWith gigabit you have\nto be in full duplex.\n\n455\n00:22:59.865 --> 00:23:02.188\nAnd it kind of creates a link.\n\n456\n00:23:02.188 --> 00:23:04.128\nAnd it's kind of defining\nwho's gonna be the master.\n\n457\n00:23:04.128 --> 00:23:06.070\nAnd we usually just let that be auto.\n\n458\n00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.580\nBut in here somewhere I'll find my speeds.\n\n459\n00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.570\nOr I might not, right?\n\n460\n00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.880\nIn some systems they don't let\nyou do it with the right driver.\n\n461\n00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.955\nSo I might need to go and get Intel's\nlatest driver to be able to set that.\n\n462\n00:23:14.955 --> 00:23:16.570\nBut-\n&gt;&gt; There it is, Speed &amp; Duplex.\n\n463\n00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:17.741\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Wes.\n\n464\n00:23:17.741 --> 00:23:19.780\nI was looking right at it,\nI was getting worried for a second there.\n\n465\n00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.886\nI thought shoot,\ndoes this adapter not have it?\n\n466\n00:23:21.886 --> 00:23:23.614\nSo I've got Speed &amp; Duplex, and\n\n467\n00:23:23.614 --> 00:23:26.463\nwhen I drop that down\nAuto Negotiation is the default.\n\n468\n00:23:26.463 --> 00:23:29.850\nBut notice how Gbps only has Full Duplex.\n\n469\n00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.664\nAnd then 10 and\n100 have Full and Half, right?\n\n470\n00:23:32.664 --> 00:23:33.674\nSo I can manually set it.\n\n471\n00:23:33.674 --> 00:23:34.277\nI can say, you know what?\n\n472\n00:23:34.277 --> 00:23:37.850\nNo, this is 100 Mbps Full Duplex.\n\n473\n00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:39.960\nYou can force that setting, all right?\n\n474\n00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:44.100\nNow sometimes we're doing this because\nauto detection isn't a guarantee.\n\n475\n00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.230\nSometimes we're doing it because for\nwhatever reason,\n\n476\n00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.140\nwe're just not negotiating\nthe right thing.\n\n477\n00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.014\nIt could be that you've\ngot the wrong cabling.\n\n478\n00:23:51.014 --> 00:23:54.776\nIf you've got CAT5 cabling and\nyou're trying to do gigabit over it,\n\n479\n00:23:54.776 --> 00:23:55.684\nit may not work.\n\n480\n00:23:55.684 --> 00:23:58.800\nIt'll work over a certain distance,\nmaybe 20 meters.\n\n481\n00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.190\nOnce you get over 20 meters\nThat Gigabit starts to break down.\n\n482\n00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:08.126\nIf you have Cat 5e or Cat 6,\nyou can do Gigabit up to 100 meters.\n\n483\n00:24:08.126 --> 00:24:10.090\nYou can go a huge distance.\n\n484\n00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:12.070\nBut on the wrong cable\nyou can't get this far.\n\n485\n00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:14.424\nSo you might not be negotiating because\nyou're on the wrong cable type.\n\n486\n00:24:14.424 --> 00:24:16.351\nMaybe you got Cat 3, right?\n\n487\n00:24:16.351 --> 00:24:19.556\nYou'd be surprised how many\nbuildings you run to install Cat 3.\n\n488\n00:24:19.556 --> 00:24:22.822\nAnd so, you're only getting ten\nMegabit and you don't know why.\n\n489\n00:24:22.822 --> 00:24:25.000\nAnd you're only getting half duplex, and\n\n490\n00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.580\nif you force it then you drop off\nthe network and you can't talk at all.\n\n491\n00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.190\nBecause, you're trying to do full\nduplex on link that won't do it, right?\n\n492\n00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:34.905\nSo, you gotta make sure you have the right\ncabling type to go along with it too.\n\n493\n00:24:34.905 --> 00:24:39.000\nBut you can manually set this to make sure\nthat, hey, I'm only gonna run at a Gig.\n\n494\n00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.140\nI don't want to auto negotiate,\nif I auto negotiate anything lower,\n\n495\n00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:42.710\nsomething's wrong.\n\n496\n00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.190\nAnd I need to know that\nsomething's wrong anyway.\n\n497\n00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.640\nSo, we don't wanna run on\na network that's damaged.\n\n498\n00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.730\nThis will make sure that it's hard set.\n\n499\n00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:53.520\nI recommend hard setting it,\nnot just on the host side, but\n\n500\n00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.860\non the switch side also.\n\n501\n00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.800\nGo to the switch, tell it to do\nGigabit and not on to negotiate also.\n\n502\n00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.652\nOr 10 Gigabit or 100 Megabit full duplex.\n\n503\n00:25:01.652 --> 00:25:03.490\nOr whatever it is you need to set.\n\n504\n00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:04.130\nJust know giga or\n\n505\n00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.820\nhigher we know some duplex anymore\nbecause they are all run in full duplex.\n\n506\n00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.620\n100 megabyte lower,\nyou can do duplex in two.\n\n507\n00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.890\nAll right, so those are a couple\nof things that we're gonna see.\n\n508\n00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.600\nBe aware that ten Gigabit\nis not an uncommon thing.\n\n509\n00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.427\nI know we've got it in\nthe systems right here behind me.\n\n510\n00:25:19.427 --> 00:25:22.910\n40 Gigabit is very common for\nuplinks these days.\n\n511\n00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:25.060\nAnd that means, we're gonna see it\nstart transitioning into the server\n\n512\n00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.410\nspace eventually.\n\n513\n00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:30.740\nWhen you have teamed NICs, when you have\nmultiple NICs that are bonded together.\n\n514\n00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.690\nMake sure they're running at\nthe same speed in the same duplex.\n\n515\n00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:36.772\nWhen you have team NICs and they have\ndifferent speeds and different duplexes,\n\n516\n00:25:36.772 --> 00:25:38.061\nit causes all sorts of problems.\n\n517\n00:25:38.061 --> 00:25:39.870\nSo you wanna make sure that's consistent.\n\n518\n00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.280\nIf they're just independent adapters,\nyou can have a mixture.\n\n519\n00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:42.980\nIt's not a big deal.\n\n520\n00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.370\nBut when you're teaming, they need to\nbe as a close to identical as possible.\n\n521\n00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:48.240\nThat's kind of a key concept.\n\n522\n00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.420\nAll right, but otherwise, as far as\nsetting up an adapter on the server,\n\n523\n00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.730\nthose are the key things\nwe need to remember.\n\n524\n00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.330\nGet that IP address assigned.\n\n525\n00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.320\nMake sure you document\neverything that you do.\n\n526\n00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.450\nAnd now, you're ready to\ncommunicate on the network.\n\n527\n00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:02.040\nAnd move on to the next step\nto configuring your server.\n\n528\n00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, well we appreciate you\ntaking us through the journey in these two\n\n529\n00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:07.600\nepisodes on IP addressing and servicing.\n\n530\n00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.960\nThe clock does say that we\nare running to the end.\n\n531\n00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.350\nAnd I know you did say\nthat's about all you have.\n\n532\n00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:17.150\nBut before we do sign out, you have any\nadditional considerations you might want\n\n533\n00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:20.340\nto throw our viewers there when it\ncomes to IP addressing and service?\n\n534\n00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.880\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\nBefore you start dumping IP's on\n\n535\n00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:22.780\nyour servers.\n\n536\n00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.098\nIf you're a system admin, and\nyou've got a networking team,\n\n537\n00:26:25.098 --> 00:26:27.869\nmake sure you co-ordinate with\na networking team, your network admins.\n\n538\n00:26:27.869 --> 00:26:29.886\nBecause they're gonna help you\nwith that one to one NAT mapping.\n\n539\n00:26:29.886 --> 00:26:33.320\nAnd if you need that or, ports,\nfirewall configurations, so, sysadmins and\n\n540\n00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.795\nnetwork admins need to work\ntogether on stuff like this.\n\n541\n00:26:35.795 --> 00:26:37.478\nTo make sure that everybody's\non the same page.\n\n542\n00:26:37.478 --> 00:26:40.215\nAlso, always remember to\nupdate your DNS records.\n\n543\n00:26:40.215 --> 00:26:42.679\nTo reflect the name mapping to the new IP.\n\n544\n00:26:42.679 --> 00:26:46.000\nSo you consistent look up\nall just things to remember.\n\n545\n00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.330\nAnd it should be part of your kind\nof server build documentation.\n\n546\n00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.200\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, documentation [LAUGH]\ndocumentation that's right.\n\n547\n00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.220\nWe're gonna go ahead and we'll take\nthis time to sign out for ITProTV.\n\n548\n00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.800\nWe do hope you've enjoyed it.\n\n549\n00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.350\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n550\n00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.920\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n551\n00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.671\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n552\n00:27:00.671 --> 00:27:07.426\n[MUSIC]\n\n553\n00:27:07.426 --> 00:27:10.143\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.290\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.958\n&gt;&gt; Your watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.136\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode here\nat ITProTV, I'm your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n6\n00:00:16.136 --> 00:00:20.500\nin todays episode we're continuing through\na very fun series that is the server plus\n\n7\n00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.030\nseries from Comptia.\n\n8\n00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.970\nAnd joining us in the studios for\nthis very endeavor is none other than Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.610\nDon Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.720\nDon, how are you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.680\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes,\n\n12\n00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.190\nready to continue our networking\nadventure inside of Server Plus.\n\n13\n00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.930\nIn these last couple of episodes,\nwhat we've been doing is tackling network\n\n14\n00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.150\nconcepts that we need to know as we deploy\nservers to get them ready on the network.\n\n15\n00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.920\nIn a previous episode we talked\nabout assigning IP addresses.\n\n16\n00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.830\nIn this episode we're gonna talk\na little bit about network ports.\n\n17\n00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.690\nAnd ports are really important on\na server, because when we set up a server,\n\n18\n00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.060\nwe typically want people to\nbe able to connect to it.\n\n19\n00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.890\nAnd that means the server has\nsome data that's important to\n\n20\n00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:54.660\nus that we want to share.\n\n21\n00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.280\nAnd if the data's important to us,\nwe wanna protect it.\n\n22\n00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.250\nAnd if you're gonna protect it,\nyou usually do that with a firewall.\n\n23\n00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.650\nWell, if there's a firewall\nin between our server and\n\n24\n00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.300\nour clients, we need to make sure\nthat we open up the appropriate\n\n25\n00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.840\nports on that firewall to allow people\nto connect to our services, and\n\n26\n00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.020\ndon't allow them to connect to any\nother ports that are available.\n\n27\n00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.760\nSo we do need to have a good\nunderstanding of how these ports work.\n\n28\n00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.430\nWhat they do and\nwhat some of the common port numbers are.\n\n29\n00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.970\nSo let's just start off right off the\nbeginning here with what ports are, right?\n\n30\n00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.070\nWhen I connect from my laptop to a server,\nright?\n\n31\n00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.970\nSo let's say I go to www.google.com.\n\n32\n00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.310\nI go to their website, right.\n\n33\n00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.150\nWell I take my traffic and\nI put it into a packet,\n\n34\n00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.240\nthat ultimately gets thrown into a frame,\nand thrown out across the internet.\n\n35\n00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.800\nAnd it makes all the way across the world\nto wherever Google's servers are.\n\n36\n00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.580\nAnd it lands on one of their servers.\n\n37\n00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.287\nWhen the server receives that packet,\nhow does it know what to do with it?\n\n38\n00:01:47.287 --> 00:01:49.270\nIt looks to the port number.\n\n39\n00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.812\nThat packet will have a destination port\nnumber, and the destination port number\n\n40\n00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:56.780\nhelps that server identify\nwhere that traffic needs to go.\n\n41\n00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.630\nSo, for example secure web traffic, HTTPS.\n\n42\n00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.670\nHTTPS uses port 443, so\n\n43\n00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.690\nany time a server receives traffic on port\n443 it knows that it's secure web traffic.\n\n44\n00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.770\nAnd it'll say okay,\nI need to hand this over to my web server.\n\n45\n00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.540\nVersus if it receives traffic\non something like port 25,\n\n46\n00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.030\nit says hey, that's email traffic.\n\n47\n00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.670\nI need to give that to my email server.\n\n48\n00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.900\nSo the port numbers help us to\nidentify what the traffic is.\n\n49\n00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.220\nAnd these are being done all the time\nin the background of your system and\n\n50\n00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.810\nyou don't really notice.\n\n51\n00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.520\nFor example, here,\nI'll take this Linux box, and\n\n52\n00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.890\nlet me get a terminal open and\na web browser.\n\n53\n00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.100\nSo I'm gonna browse to our\nfirewall here in the building.\n\n54\n00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.810\nSo if I go to 10.0.0.1,\n\n55\n00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.840\nhere's our firewall's web page right it's\na PF Sense firewall and it used HTTPS.\n\n56\n00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.030\nSo I made a secure\nconnection to that firewall.\n\n57\n00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.320\nWell, if I jump over to my terminal.\n\n58\n00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:00.460\nI can do a netstat -an, and\nI'm gonna search for 10.0.0.1, all right.\n\n59\n00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.340\nAnd what netstat -an does is it says,\nshow me all of my connections and\n\n60\n00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.790\ndo name trans or don't do name\ntranslations, it just shows me the IPs.\n\n61\n00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.360\nName translations take a long time,\nso let's skip those.\n\n62\n00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.708\nAnd what I can see is that I created\na TCP connection between my laptop,\n\n63\n00:03:17.708 --> 00:03:21.518\n10.0.222.101, and the firewall,\n\n64\n00:03:21.518 --> 00:03:25.978\n10.0.0.1, right, there's that connection.\n\n65\n00:03:25.978 --> 00:03:29.838\nAnd I've got a source port and\na destination port.\n\n66\n00:03:29.838 --> 00:03:32.276\nAnd that destination port,\nthat's what's really important right?\n\n67\n00:03:32.276 --> 00:03:39.160\n443, I wanted to connect to a secure\nweb server, and I did that on port 443.\n\n68\n00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.710\nOn the source port,\n\n69\n00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.110\nthis is really just a random port\nnumber that I picked myself, right?\n\n70\n00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.330\nYou picked it right out of the cloud and\nsaid hey, I'm gonna use this number.\n\n71\n00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.810\nI need a random number,\n\n72\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.470\nbecause what if I open up more than\none tab to that server, right?\n\n73\n00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.820\nSo if you think about it if I were\nto browse to CNN's web page and\n\n74\n00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.490\nI had three different tabs that\nwere all opened up to CNN, right?\n\n75\n00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.960\nSo let's do this.\n\n76\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.222\nSo if I go to cnn.com and then I'll do\nthe same thing in another tab here,\n\n77\n00:04:08.222 --> 00:04:12.644\nI'll go to cnn.com and\nI'll do one more cnn.com, right?\n\n78\n00:04:12.644 --> 00:04:17.170\nSo I've got three connections\nto CNN all from my laptop,\n\n79\n00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:23.930\nmy laptop 10:02.22.101,\nall connecting out here to this site.\n\n80\n00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.660\nWell when I go to one of these tabs,\nI've seen they're all identical.\n\n81\n00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.570\nIf I go to one of them and I click on\na link to read this article, right?\n\n82\n00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.140\nSee the other tabs didn't change pages,\nonly this one tab did.\n\n83\n00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.960\nHow did it know which tab it went to?\n\n84\n00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.170\nIf they all using the same\ndestination port,\n\n85\n00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.510\nthey're all going port,\nthis is not secure.\n\n86\n00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.860\nThis is all going on port 80, right.\n\n87\n00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.550\nWell, the reason it was able to do that,\nwas because,\n\n88\n00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.380\nback here, if I search for,\nI don't know the IP of that one.\n\n89\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.160\nSo let me just search for\nanything on port 80.\n\n90\n00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.330\nI can see all these connections\nthat I've established on port 80.\n\n91\n00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.000\nAnd as you look in here,\n\n92\n00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.060\nI'll find duplicates because I've\ngot more than one connection to CNN.\n\n93\n00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.782\nAnd, shoot,\nthey're behind a load balancer.\n\n94\n00:05:10.782 --> 00:05:13.932\nBut, all right, so here's one,\n52.204.201.112 and\n\n95\n00:05:13.932 --> 00:05:17.170\nright down here I've got\nanother one 52.204.201.112.\n\n96\n00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.520\nSo let me shrink down my\nsearch a little bit here.\n\n97\n00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.127\nAnd we'll search for just that IEP.\n\n98\n00:05:26.127 --> 00:05:31.588\nShoot, the connections do time out after a\nlittle bit, they don't stay open forever.\n\n99\n00:05:31.588 --> 00:05:32.812\nSo apparently I waited too long.\n\n100\n00:05:32.812 --> 00:05:34.200\nAll right, we can just look up here.\n\n101\n00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.306\nSo when I find those entries and I look at\nthem, here's one, and my source port was\n\n102\n00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:44.201\n52612 and if I scroll up to the other one,\nmy source port was 52610.\n\n103\n00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:46.573\nAnd there's probably\na 52611 somewhere in here,\n\n104\n00:05:46.573 --> 00:05:49.953\nit might have timed out by that point cuz\nit's just incrementing by one each time\n\n105\n00:05:49.953 --> 00:05:52.640\nand that's how we know that\nthese are two separate tabs.\n\n106\n00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.100\nAnd when I get the reply from the server,\nI know exactly which tab to send it to.\n\n107\n00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.870\nSo the source port is really just\nused to differentiate traffic.\n\n108\n00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.161\nBut the destination port,\n\n109\n00:06:00.161 --> 00:06:03.370\nthat's how I tell the server\nwhat I'm trying to connect to.\n\n110\n00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.910\nSo that destination port\nis pretty important and\n\n111\n00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.440\nthat's used every time we communicate.\n\n112\n00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.130\nThat's a part of our communications.\n\n113\n00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.860\nWe build a communication with a source and\n\n114\n00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.640\ndestination IP and a source and\na destination port number.\n\n115\n00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.150\nAnd the server receives that traffic and\nknows what to do with it.\n\n116\n00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.580\nAnd when they reply, it flips them around.\n\n117\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.080\nSo the source from the server is port 80.\n\n118\n00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.100\nBut the destination is that random port\nnumber that I chose when I reached out.\n\n119\n00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.580\nSo it can come back to me and connect.\n\n120\n00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.820\nSo port numbers are in constant\nuse in every communication you do\n\n121\n00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.920\nin the background, whether it's\nIPv4 like I'm showing here or IPv6.\n\n122\n00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.330\nThey all use port numbers to be\nable to uniquely identify traffic.\n\n123\n00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:50.170\nNow, when we reach out and connect,\nthere is more than one way to connect,\n\n124\n00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.450\nyou probably notice when I was looking\nat it here, see on the left side,\n\n125\n00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.430\nall these show tcp.\n\n126\n00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.490\nRight, these are all using\nTransmission Control Protocol.\n\n127\n00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:04.450\nWell, on IP based networks, there's really\ntwo main protocols we use, TCP and UDP.\n\n128\n00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.300\nTransmission Control Protocol and\nUser Datagram Protocol.\n\n129\n00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.790\nTCP and UDP really achieve the same goal.\n\n130\n00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.030\nThey allow us to talk to\nsomebody else on the network.\n\n131\n00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.660\nAnd for the most part,\nwe don't really care which one we use.\n\n132\n00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.792\nBut they do function differently,\nthe two of them.\n\n133\n00:07:19.792 --> 00:07:22.360\nTCP is what's called\nthe reliable protocol.\n\n134\n00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.790\nIn other words when I send a packet,\nif I send from me to CNN's web server,\n\n135\n00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.340\nI want to guarantee that traffic gets\nto CNN and if it doesn't get there,\n\n136\n00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.740\nI wanna retransmit,\nI wanna resend it, right?\n\n137\n00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.410\nBecause when I communicate I may\noften break up one packet into many,\n\n138\n00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.445\nmany segments to get it to\nfit on the network, right?\n\n139\n00:07:40.445 --> 00:07:43.110\nNetworks can only carry\npackets of a certain size.\n\n140\n00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.700\nYou have a maximum transmission\nunit you have to fall under.\n\n141\n00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.396\nAnd so, if we have to break something\nup into segments, I need to make sure I\n\n142\n00:07:49.396 --> 00:07:52.701\nget every single piece so\nI can put it back together again, right?\n\n143\n00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:56.277\nI don't want half of my email,\nI want all of my email, right?\n\n144\n00:07:56.277 --> 00:07:58.640\nI don't want half of an image,\nI want the whole image.\n\n145\n00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.043\nAnd we need a way to track that and\nkeep that straight, and TCP does that.\n\n146\n00:08:03.043 --> 00:08:07.501\nIt keeps track of each segment, so that it\ncan reassemble them and put them back in\n\n147\n00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:12.960\norder, and if any piece is missing, it can\nrequest a re-transmit to get those back.\n\n148\n00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.150\nSo, when you see TCP working on a network,\nit looks like this.\n\n149\n00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.580\nWhen you send data across, right?\n\n150\n00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.080\nAnd on the other side,\n\n151\n00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.170\nwhen it receives that data,\nit sends an acknowledgement back.\n\n152\n00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.890\nAn acknowledgement is saying yes,\nI got the data.\n\n153\n00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.600\nOr it sends a negative acknowledgement,\na NACK back saying, no,\n\n154\n00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.150\nI didn't get the data.\n\n155\n00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.260\nAnd then we can retransmit it.\n\n156\n00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.600\nWe can send it across.\n\n157\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.887\nSo anytime you communicate with TCP,\nthere is a handshake that happens,\n\n158\n00:08:39.887 --> 00:08:43.439\nwhere you synchronize your sequence\nnumbers, so that the other side knows what\n\n159\n00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:46.849\nnumbers to expect, and you know what\nnumbers to expect from the other side.\n\n160\n00:08:46.849 --> 00:08:49.991\nAnd that way, if anything gets missed,\nyou'll know, you'll spot it,\n\n161\n00:08:49.991 --> 00:08:54.180\nyou'll be able to recognize that that's\nmissing and request a retransmit.\n\n162\n00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.960\nThat's good for\nreliable transmission of data.\n\n163\n00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.220\nIt's not so good for speed though, right?\n\n164\n00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.748\nIf I have to request a retransmit,\nthat's a delay.\n\n165\n00:09:02.748 --> 00:09:06.440\nSo, I've gotta put this on hold, let\nme go get what I missed, get that back.\n\n166\n00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.870\nNow we can move forward again.\n\n167\n00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:08.530\nThat doesn't work so\n\n168\n00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:12.130\nwell with real time protocols,\nthings that need to go fast, right?\n\n169\n00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:13.500\nWhat needs to go fast?\n\n170\n00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.780\nVoice over IP.\n\n171\n00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.180\nIf I'm the phone with somebody,\nand a packet gets dropped,\n\n172\n00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.950\ndo I want the call to pause,\nhave it request that traffic over again?\n\n173\n00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.650\nAnd then inject that data and\nlet me hear it?\n\n174\n00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.520\nAnd then start moving forward again?\n\n175\n00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.350\nWell, it might only be a nanosecond or\ntwo.\n\n176\n00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.950\nIt could be a millisecond or two.\n\n177\n00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.670\nIt could, more realistically,\nbe like 40 or 50 milliseconds.\n\n178\n00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:37.720\nThat adds up after awhile.\n\n179\n00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.030\nAfter enough of these pauses,\n\n180\n00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.700\nthe call gets so out of sync,\nthat it's no longer able to function.\n\n181\n00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.188\nSo, for things like streaming video,\nstreaming audio,\n\n182\n00:09:46.188 --> 00:09:50.230\nvoice-over IP,\nwe don't normally want retransmits.\n\n183\n00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:53.040\nHey, if I miss a packet,\njust skip over it.\n\n184\n00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.400\nMost people won't even\nnotice a single one missing.\n\n185\n00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.730\nIf there's a series of them,\nyeah, they might hear it.\n\n186\n00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.120\nIt drops out for a second,\nbut just continue on.\n\n187\n00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.030\nDon't put me back.\n\n188\n00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.250\nAnything that's live,\nyou just want to skip what was missed.\n\n189\n00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.290\nAnd that's where UDP comes in.\n\n190\n00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.690\nUDP, the User Datagram Protocol,\nit just sends.\n\n191\n00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.820\nThere's no handshake,\nthere's no acknowledgement or\n\n192\n00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.280\nnegative acknowledgment,\nthere's just synchronization.\n\n193\n00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.120\nWe just start throwing data\nover at the other side.\n\n194\n00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.370\nRight, and the other side gets it.\n\n195\n00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.830\nAnd if it misses something,\nbig deal, it skips over it.\n\n196\n00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:25.990\nSo, this isn't a reliable transport,\nthis is called a best effort transport.\n\n197\n00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:29.080\nWe make our best effort to get\nthe data to the other side, but\n\n198\n00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.770\nif it doesn't get there,\nit just doesn't get there.\n\n199\n00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.931\nThat's not good for email, that's not good\nfor file transfers, but it is good for\n\n200\n00:10:37.931 --> 00:10:39.544\nlife things.Things like voice.\n\n201\n00:10:39.544 --> 00:10:43.743\n&gt;&gt; So, traditional traffic like things\nlike FTP, like you were talking about,\n\n202\n00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:45.152\nlike SMTP and these mail.\n\n203\n00:10:45.152 --> 00:10:49.795\nThey can handle like transmission control\nprotocol, almost needed, versus the more.\n\n204\n00:10:49.795 --> 00:10:53.385\nAnd high bandwidth, high priority,\nvery fast delivery,\n\n205\n00:10:53.385 --> 00:10:56.965\nwe're gonna use UDP, because we certainly\ndon't need things reconstructed,\n\n206\n00:10:56.965 --> 00:11:00.095\nput back in the right order,\nand then process that data.\n\n207\n00:11:00.095 --> 00:11:01.375\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n208\n00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:05.835\nAnd there's scenarios with video with hey,\nmaybe you want to stream 4k video, and you\n\n209\n00:11:05.835 --> 00:11:10.670\nwant to get the best experience possible,\nso you use TCP, you can do it, right?\n\n210\n00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.040\nBut, anytime packets drop,\n\n211\n00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.730\nyou would have to pause the video while\nit kind of got what was missing, right?\n\n212\n00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.230\nSo, that's why most video\nplayers will do buffering.\n\n213\n00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:24.580\nThey'll buffer 30 seconds,\nor a minute worth of video.\n\n214\n00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.360\nAnd that way, if packets drop,\n\n215\n00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.100\nit's got 30 seconds to be\nable to get what was missing.\n\n216\n00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.960\nAnd that's fine for\ndata that's already been created.\n\n217\n00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.010\nBut if you're on the phone with somebody,\n\n218\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.530\nyou can't buffer something\nsomebody hasn't even said yet.\n\n219\n00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.441\nYou wanna get that data as fast as\npossible, and that's where UDP comes in.\n\n220\n00:11:40.441 --> 00:11:43.175\nUDP is all about speed, not reliability.\n\n221\n00:11:43.175 --> 00:11:48.790\n&gt;&gt; Don, a question here for\nfrom your server side, how does TCP affect\n\n222\n00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:52.600\nthe performance of the network adapter\nin a server, versus something like UDP?\n\n223\n00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.260\nNow, we've talked about its\nreliability in moving data, or\n\n224\n00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.710\nthe unreliable nature\nconnectionless nature.\n\n225\n00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.920\nHow does it affect the performance inside\nof the server if you have a bunch of TCP,\n\n226\n00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.460\nversus something like UDP communications?\n\n227\n00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.260\n&gt;&gt; All right, so UDP is faster and\nrequires less resources.\n\n228\n00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.054\nJust doing less work, right, really,\nI'm doing a whole heck of a lot.\n\n229\n00:12:10.054 --> 00:12:12.808\nTCP on the other hand,\nnow we're having to track sections,\n\n230\n00:12:12.808 --> 00:12:15.459\nwe have to track sequence numbers and\nsynchronizations.\n\n231\n00:12:15.459 --> 00:12:18.800\nSo, we gotta do all this extra stuff,\nand it does create a burden, right?\n\n232\n00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.250\nAnd when it's done in software,\nthat burden can get sizable.\n\n233\n00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.040\nOn a laptop, on a desktop,\nit's not enough, it's not gonna happen.\n\n234\n00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.780\nBut, if I'm Google, and I have hundreds of\nthousands of people hitting my web server\n\n235\n00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.800\nevery single hour, that's a huge\namount of TCP sessions to track.\n\n236\n00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.920\nSo in a server, when you buy a server,\nthe network adapters that are in it,\n\n237\n00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.860\nusually have an option to get what's\ncalled a TOE, or a TCP Offload Engine.\n\n238\n00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.290\nThat TOE says I'm not gonna track\nsynchronizations and sessions and\n\n239\n00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:51.250\nall that in software,\nI'm gonna do it in hardware.\n\n240\n00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.030\nThere's actual circuitry right\non the network adapter that\n\n241\n00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.330\nhandles all the session tracking, and it\ntakes the burden off the operating system.\n\n242\n00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.130\nSo, if you have a TOE,\nyour system can handle a huge\n\n243\n00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.470\namount of connections without placing\na burden on the operating system.\n\n244\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.750\nIf you don't have a TOE, though,\nyour system's doing it in software.\n\n245\n00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.250\nRight, and that is gonna create a burden.\n\n246\n00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.880\nAnd you just have to track it, right?\n\n247\n00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.390\nYou may need to add more web servers, or\n\n248\n00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.300\nmore file servers to be able\nto compensate for that load.\n\n249\n00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:19.200\nAll right, now whether we use TCP or\nUDP, we still have port numbers.\n\n250\n00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.110\nThe port numbers are used for\nboth of them.\n\n251\n00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:25.345\nAnd so, when we connect, the port number\nidentifies the protocol that we're using.\n\n252\n00:13:25.345 --> 00:13:29.690\nAnd then based on the protocol, the\nprotocol determines whether it uses TCP or\n\n253\n00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:30.700\nUDP, right?\n\n254\n00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.110\nSo they kind of all fall into play.\n\n255\n00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:37.970\nAnd when I showed those port numbers\nearlier, I mentioned how secure web\n\n256\n00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:43.070\nis port 443, and when we connect our\noutgoing port is kind of randomly chosen.\n\n257\n00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.032\nWell, it's actually not so random.\n\n258\n00:13:46.032 --> 00:13:49.071\nPort numbers are divided\ninto three categories, and\n\n259\n00:13:49.071 --> 00:13:51.036\nthe three categories right here.\n\n260\n00:13:51.036 --> 00:13:55.320\nWe've got 0 through 1023, these are what\nare called well-known port numbers.\n\n261\n00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.520\nThese are registered with the INA,\nthey've been assigned to protocols, and\n\n262\n00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.750\nyou're not allowed to use them for\nanything,\n\n263\n00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.750\nother than their intended purpose,\nor you're not supposed to.\n\n264\n00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.297\nSo, it's not like there's a IP police out\nthere that are coming and get you, but\n\n265\n00:14:07.297 --> 00:14:09.489\nyou're not supposed to use them\noutside of their intended purpose.\n\n266\n00:14:09.489 --> 00:14:13.819\nSo, for example, I mentioned\nsecure web traffic is on port 443,\n\n267\n00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:17.943\nI know that because that's in this range,\n0 through 1023.\n\n268\n00:14:17.943 --> 00:14:21.156\nAnd if I go to the IANA's website,\nthey list all those ports, and\n\n269\n00:14:21.156 --> 00:14:24.676\nwhat's assigned to them, and\nit's assigned to 443, that's it.\n\n270\n00:14:24.676 --> 00:14:29.203\nWell, back in the day, they didn't fathom\nhaving more than 1000 protocols out there,\n\n271\n00:14:29.203 --> 00:14:31.072\nso they thought that would be enough.\n\n272\n00:14:31.072 --> 00:14:36.491\nIt wasn't [LAUGH] and so, they added more,\nand now it goes all the way up to 49,151.\n\n273\n00:14:36.491 --> 00:14:41.071\n49,000 ports that can be statically\nassigned, or reserved for\n\n274\n00:14:41.071 --> 00:14:42.630\ndifferent protocols.\n\n275\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:46.059\nNow, this range here, 1024 all the way\nto 49151, wasn't always reserved.\n\n276\n00:14:46.059 --> 00:14:48.939\nAnd so,\nyour operating system can use these for\n\n277\n00:14:48.939 --> 00:14:52.030\nthings, other than their intended purpose.\n\n278\n00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.378\nYou just need to know that a lot of\nthem are registered to other people now.\n\n279\n00:14:55.378 --> 00:15:03.270\nBut above 49,151,\nwe get to 49,152 all the way to 65,535.\n\n280\n00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.785\nIt's a 16 bit number,\nthat's why it ends at 65535.\n\n281\n00:15:06.785 --> 00:15:12.007\nSo, when we get all the way up here,\nthese are called dynamic port numbers.\n\n282\n00:15:12.007 --> 00:15:17.130\nThey're not registered with an IANA,\nthey're just available for you to use.\n\n283\n00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.831\nAnd so, with our outgoing communications,\n\n284\n00:15:19.831 --> 00:15:23.321\nyour operating system will\nselect a number in this range.\n\n285\n00:15:23.321 --> 00:15:26.361\nAnd as it communicates,\nit will either randomly jump around, or\n\n286\n00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:27.926\nit will slowly increment by one.\n\n287\n00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:33.360\nOn my Windows server, on my Red Hat server\nhere, they both just increment by one.\n\n288\n00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.300\nSo, they might start at 49152, the next\nconnection will be at 153, and then 154,\n\n289\n00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.557\nand so on all the way up.\n\n290\n00:15:39.557 --> 00:15:46.026\nUntil they get all the way to 65,535, then\nthey'd start back over again at 49,152.\n\n291\n00:15:46.026 --> 00:15:50.028\nOther operating systems like Solaris tried\nto minimize its fingerprint on the network\n\n292\n00:15:50.028 --> 00:15:52.232\nto make it harder for\nattackers to identify it.\n\n293\n00:15:52.232 --> 00:15:54.361\nAnd so, it would jump around\ndifferent port numbers.\n\n294\n00:15:54.361 --> 00:15:56.555\nAnd different operating systems\nhandle it different ways.\n\n295\n00:15:56.555 --> 00:15:59.464\nBut they stay in that range, typically.\n\n296\n00:15:59.464 --> 00:16:01.677\nFor outside of the range,\nit's not the end of the world, but\n\n297\n00:16:01.677 --> 00:16:03.210\nthis is is where you'll typically stay.\n\n298\n00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.730\nFor the exam,\n\n299\n00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:10.480\nwhat CompTIA wants you to have is\na familiarity with the common protocols.\n\n300\n00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.190\nThey don't want you to\nmemorize 1,023 protocols,\n\n301\n00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:18.060\nthat's crazy talk, but you need to\nbe familiar with the common ones.\n\n302\n00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.283\nBecause these little ones you're\ngonna be using in your servers and\n\n303\n00:16:20.283 --> 00:16:22.935\nthese are the ones that you're gonna have\nto talk to the network team and say hey,\n\n304\n00:16:22.935 --> 00:16:24.510\nguys, I'm standing up in the email server.\n\n305\n00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:26.640\nAnd so I need you to open up\nthese ports in the firewall and\n\n306\n00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.020\nput them in to my server.\n\n307\n00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.052\nOr, I need to troubleshoot,\nemails aren't getting through.\n\n308\n00:16:31.052 --> 00:16:33.860\nCan you tell me if traffic on\nthis port is being allowed, or\n\n309\n00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.630\nif you see traffic on this port?\n\n310\n00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.922\nThese are things that are really handy for\nus to use.\n\n311\n00:16:37.922 --> 00:16:41.942\nAnd if we're using a network scanner like\nNmap, you can scan the network to find\n\n312\n00:16:41.942 --> 00:16:46.142\nhosts that are running a certain service,\nlike, I wanna find all the web servers on\n\n313\n00:16:46.142 --> 00:16:50.260\nmy network, so let me run a port scan for\nport 80 across all my servers.\n\n314\n00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.350\nWell, we can do that, if we know the port\nnumbers and we know what to look for.\n\n315\n00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.145\nSo, that's why it's\nbeneficial to know these.\n\n316\n00:16:56.145 --> 00:16:59.690\nAnd this is probably not new to you,\nyou've probably seen all of these in\n\n317\n00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.970\nNetwork Plus, or A+, or\nother certifications that you've done.\n\n318\n00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:04.520\nBut they're for the exam so\n\n319\n00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.890\nwe need to cover them to make sure\nwe've got them and that we know them.\n\n320\n00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:08.540\nSo, this is a good idea to memorize these.\n\n321\n00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.647\nI'll put a table in the episode notes so\nthat you can see those, and\n\n322\n00:17:11.647 --> 00:17:14.380\nyou just have to memorize it,\nit's kinda tough.\n\n323\n00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.290\nBut the common ports,\nI've got laid out right here.\n\n324\n00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.740\nSo lets just run through these and\nI wish it was only one page.\n\n325\n00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:26.770\nWe actually got about 23 or 24 different\nports that you're expected to know.\n\n326\n00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.720\nA lot of are combined together though, and\n\n327\n00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.940\nmost of them you've seen enough that they\nshould come from memory pretty easy.\n\n328\n00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.420\nSo lets just run through\nthese real quick and\n\n329\n00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.560\nwe'll tackle each of these protocols and\nhow they work.\n\n330\n00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.870\nI'm also noting whether or\nnot they use TCP or UDP, okay?\n\n331\n00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.160\nTechnically that's not on the exam, but\n\n332\n00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.550\nin real life that's an important\nthing to understand.\n\n333\n00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:48.220\nBecause when you open up a firewall rule,\n\n334\n00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.050\nyou normally have to specify\nwhether it's TCP, or UDP, or both.\n\n335\n00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.630\nSo you need to make sure you've\ngot that information, and so\n\n336\n00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.809\nI'm including that here for completeness.\n\n337\n00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.700\nAll right, the first one is\nfile transfer protocol, FTP.\n\n338\n00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:05.310\nNow, FTP is a very old protocol that\nis supported by darn near everything.\n\n339\n00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.740\nIt makes it super easy to move\nfiles between servers, and\n\n340\n00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:08.710\nworks stations, and so on.\n\n341\n00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.490\nAnd you don't care if they're running\nMac OS, or Windows, or Linux,\n\n342\n00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.210\nthey all support it.\n\n343\n00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.970\nSo it uses two ports.\n\n344\n00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.510\nWe're gonna start off with a weird one.\n\n345\n00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:19.080\nIt uses ports 20 and 21.\n\n346\n00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.020\nWhen you build a connection with FTP,\nit connects on port 21.\n\n347\n00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.590\nThat's the control port,\nit's sending all the commands on port 21.\n\n348\n00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:29.470\nAnd then when you start copying a file,\nit copies the file on port 20.\n\n349\n00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.550\nIt uses a different port for that.\n\n350\n00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:34.800\nNow, there are passive FTP Servers,\nwhere it will generate a random port for\n\n351\n00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.290\nthe file transfer.\n\n352\n00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.160\nBut in the official standard,\nit's 20 and 21.\n\n353\n00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.110\nIt's on the exam,\nthat's what you're gonna see is 20 and 21.\n\n354\n00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.860\nAnd they use TCP exclusively.\n\n355\n00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.140\nNow, why TCP?\n\n356\n00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.040\nBecause if I miss a packet,\nif I miss a segment of my data,\n\n357\n00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:49.980\nthe file's gonna be corrupt.\n\n358\n00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:50.960\nI've gotta have the whole file.\n\n359\n00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.470\nI can't just have part of the file.\n\n360\n00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.070\nSo, we've gotta use TCP so\nit's reliable data.\n\n361\n00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.150\nAnd you'll see the majority\nof these are that way,\n\n362\n00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.630\nwe're you're using TCP,\ncuz we need reliable data.\n\n363\n00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.750\nSecure Shell.\n\n364\n00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:07.500\nSecure Shell, or SSH, that's an encrypted\nshell connection to a server,\n\n365\n00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.030\nso we can remotely manage it.\n\n366\n00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.920\nIf we're doing remote management,\nthat's sensitive data.\n\n367\n00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.900\nWe don't want somebody intercepting that\ninformation, so we need to encrypt it, and\n\n368\n00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.360\nwe do that via port 22.\n\n369\n00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:22.450\nNow, SSH is really cool because,\ntechnically, SSH is an update to Telnet.\n\n370\n00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:25.600\nTelnet, which runs on port 23,\nthis next one,\n\n371\n00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.110\nis a remote shell that lets me connect\nto servers and remotely manage it.\n\n372\n00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:33.050\nBut it sends everything in plain text,\nso that's not very good.\n\n373\n00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:35.680\nWe need to encrypt it,\nthat's where SSH comes in on port 22.\n\n374\n00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.940\nCool thing about SSH,\n\n375\n00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:42.300\nis you can throw darn near anything\nover an SSH tunnel to a server.\n\n376\n00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.840\nSo you can use SSH to secure other things.\n\n377\n00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.162\nAnd two great examples of that are CP,\nthe copy protocol,\n\n378\n00:19:50.162 --> 00:19:52.270\nwe have the secure copy protocol.\n\n379\n00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:58.230\nWhich is really just the bash copy\ncommand being run over an SSH shell,\n\n380\n00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.060\nso it's on port 22, cuz it's SSH.\n\n381\n00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.890\nAnd secure FTP.\n\n382\n00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.820\nFTP sends things in plain text also.\n\n383\n00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:10.590\nWell, I can throw it over an SSH\ntunnel and now it's secure.\n\n384\n00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:15.460\nSo SFTP is really just FTP running\non top of SSH so it uses port 22.\n\n385\n00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.250\nThey're all TCP, they're all port 22.\n\n386\n00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:23.424\nAnything thrown over SSH technically\nbecomes SSH, so it's a common port number.\n\n387\n00:20:25.636 --> 00:20:30.192\nYou'll see that a lot as we go down these\nprotocols, there's a lot of duplicates\n\n388\n00:20:30.192 --> 00:20:34.860\nin here, where there is the old non\nsecure one and the new secure one.\n\n389\n00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:38.442\nSMTP is another great example of that,\nwhere we got port 25 for SMTP,\n\n390\n00:20:38.442 --> 00:20:40.784\nthat's the simple mail transport protocol.\n\n391\n00:20:40.784 --> 00:20:43.360\nAnd when you have to mail servers,\nand they exchange email,\n\n392\n00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.840\nthis is what they use.\n\n393\n00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.538\nAs a client you might read your\nmail using something different,\n\n394\n00:20:48.538 --> 00:20:52.866\nbut as far as sending mail, SMTP is\nthe standard between all mail servers.\n\n395\n00:20:52.866 --> 00:20:56.769\nDoesn't matter if you're\nrunning Microsoft Exchange, or\n\n396\n00:20:56.769 --> 00:21:01.745\nLinux send mail, or QMail, SquirrelMail,\nif you're running group wise,\n\n397\n00:21:01.745 --> 00:21:07.590\n[LAUGH] whatever it is you're running,\nthey all use SMTP, that's the standard.\n\n398\n00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.420\nAnd, unfortunately, the standard\ndoesn't include encryption, and\n\n399\n00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:15.010\nso SMTP on port 25 is unencrypted SMTP.\n\n400\n00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:19.020\nNow, it can be combined with SSL or\nTLS to provide encryption.\n\n401\n00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.320\nAnd if you do that,\nthen it moves on the other ports,\n\n402\n00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:27.220\nlike port 587 is a pretty common one\nthat you can use to encrypt SMTP.\n\n403\n00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:31.760\nBut it's really SMTP run on top of TLS,\ntransport layer security.\n\n404\n00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:36.164\nSo, it's still SMTP under the hood, it's\njust being wrapped up or something else.\n\n405\n00:21:38.283 --> 00:21:41.490\nDNS is the first one we're\ngonna get to the uses UDP.\n\n406\n00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.750\nWith DNS, it runs on port 53.\n\n407\n00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:47.901\nSo if I do a DNS look up,\nI'm gonna have a connection on port 53.\n\n408\n00:21:47.901 --> 00:21:50.810\nBut it can use TCP or UDP.\n\n409\n00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:55.315\nAnd the reason it does that is because\nif I'm just doing a small look up,\n\n410\n00:21:55.315 --> 00:22:00.905\na quick here's a name, give me an IP,\nit can all fit inside of one packet.\n\n411\n00:22:00.905 --> 00:22:04.330\nIt'll fit within the MTU size\nof darn near any network.\n\n412\n00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.810\nSo I don't need to do handshakes and all\nthat, I can just send a quick lookup and\n\n413\n00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.410\nthe server can respond to me very,\nvery fast.\n\n414\n00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.990\nAnd if I don't get a response,\nI can just retry.\n\n415\n00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.850\nI can send the lookup again.\n\n416\n00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.280\nIt's not super time sensitive.\n\n417\n00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.640\nAnd so we can just do another lookup.\n\n418\n00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.410\nI don't need to worry\nabout doing a retransmit,\n\n419\n00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.650\nor even moving to a backup\nserver is available.\n\n420\n00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.740\nWe could always jump to a whole\nnew server if we wanted.\n\n421\n00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.360\nSo DNS will predominantly use UDP.\n\n422\n00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:34.350\nBut, occasionally, you might do a DNS\nlookup where the data that comes back is\n\n423\n00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.950\nso large that it won't fit in one packet.\n\n424\n00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:43.630\nAnd when that happens, now you\nmight need a segment, and you can't\n\n425\n00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:47.360\nreally segment with UDP, cuz you might\nget part of the data and not the rest.\n\n426\n00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:51.370\nAnd so, in that scenario, you can switch\nover to TCP, and it will do the look up\n\n427\n00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.870\nusing TCP, and you'll be insured\nto get the full lookup back.\n\n428\n00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:57.920\nSo most DNS servers will make that\ndecision for you and decided,\n\n429\n00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.940\nyou'll send your request as UDP almost\nalways, unless you force it somehow.\n\n430\n00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.800\nThen the server will respond either\nusing UDP or TCP based on the need.\n\n431\n00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.560\nNow, if it's gonna respond with TCP,\nit's gonna have to do a handshake with us.\n\n432\n00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:14.050\nSo it notifies us it's making that switch,\nand then it switches over and connects.\n\n433\n00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:16.780\nBut, otherwise, it will just respond\nwith UDP and you get that information.\n\n434\n00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.310\nSo it can use either one,\nit's a switch hitter.\n\n435\n00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.385\nAfter that we've got DHCP.\n\n436\n00:23:22.385 --> 00:23:25.255\nNow, DHCP is one that we don't\nnormally think about ports on,\n\n437\n00:23:25.255 --> 00:23:27.370\ncuz DHCP is a broadcast protocol.\n\n438\n00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:29.660\nWorkstation boots up and\ndoesn't have an IP so\n\n439\n00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.620\nit just broadcasts out, hey,\nI need a server, somebody help me.\n\n440\n00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.670\nAnd the server responds with a broadcast.\n\n441\n00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:37.590\nIt broadcasts out, hey,\nhere I am, I can help you.\n\n442\n00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:38.860\nWe don't think about ports.\n\n443\n00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:45.100\nBut a port is actually used, two ports,\n67 and 68, and they're both UDP.\n\n444\n00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:49.157\nThey're UDP because, again,\nI can just request a second time.\n\n445\n00:23:49.157 --> 00:23:49.814\nIt's not a big deal.\n\n446\n00:23:49.814 --> 00:23:50.840\nI don't have to do retransmits.\n\n447\n00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:55.575\nI can't really do sequencing and\nhandshakes without an IP address yet.\n\n448\n00:23:55.575 --> 00:23:57.677\nBut I can do UDP without an IP address.\n\n449\n00:23:57.677 --> 00:24:00.295\nI can broadcast out the UDP message.\n\n450\n00:24:00.295 --> 00:24:04.601\nI can't really broadcast a TCP message\nuntil I have a subnet assigned,\n\n451\n00:24:04.601 --> 00:24:06.266\nuntil I have an IP address.\n\n452\n00:24:06.266 --> 00:24:11.181\nNow 67 is used by the client,\n68 is used by the server.\n\n453\n00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:13.581\nIn the exam objectives\nthey only call out 68,\n\n454\n00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:17.150\nwhich is the server side because\nit's server plus, right?\n\n455\n00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:18.780\nBut it's a good idea to remember both.\n\n456\n00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.650\nSo the client is gonna use 67,\nthe server's gonna use 68 when they talk.\n\n457\n00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:27.788\nIt doesn't use a randomly generated source\nlike we see in other communications,\n\n458\n00:24:27.788 --> 00:24:29.208\nit uses 67 and 68.\n\n459\n00:24:31.376 --> 00:24:35.259\nAll right, we've got HTTP, hypertext\ntransfer protocol, this is web browsing,\n\n460\n00:24:35.259 --> 00:24:36.960\nright, we use it everyday.\n\n461\n00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.010\nUnencrypted web traffic uses port 80 and\n\n462\n00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:43.590\nit uses TCP because almost every webpage\nexceeds the MTU size of a network.\n\n463\n00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:47.110\nNow more and more websites\nare moving over to secure only, so\n\n464\n00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:49.660\nwe're seeing less and\nless traffic on port 80.\n\n465\n00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.140\nBut it is still one of the more\ncommon protocols that you'll see out\n\n466\n00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.490\nthere on the Internet.\n\n467\n00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:55.219\nWe'll see the secure version\nhere in a few moments.\n\n468\n00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.628\nNow I mentioned we talked about SMTP,\nthat when we send email we're gonna\n\n469\n00:25:01.628 --> 00:25:06.545\nsend it using SMTP, but when you receive\nemail that's a little different.\n\n470\n00:25:06.545 --> 00:25:10.980\nSMTP simply moves emails that's\nall it does it just moves email.\n\n471\n00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.736\nBut when you're reading an email,\n\n472\n00:25:12.736 --> 00:25:16.611\nyou wanna do things like track whether\nit's been read or not, mark it as read.\n\n473\n00:25:16.611 --> 00:25:19.136\nYou might wanna track whether\nit's high priority or not.\n\n474\n00:25:19.136 --> 00:25:22.810\nYou might want to have sub folders\nwhere you can put data in there and\n\n475\n00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:25.020\nSMTP can't do any of that.\n\n476\n00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:28.230\nSo we have alternate protocols we use for\nreading email.\n\n477\n00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:31.070\nIf you're setting up an email server\nyou'll choose what way you want your\n\n478\n00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.950\nend users to be able to check their email.\n\n479\n00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:36.838\nAnd one of the classic ways is\npost office protocol, right,\n\n480\n00:25:36.838 --> 00:25:42.420\nPOP3 version 3 is the most common\nversion of POP and it uses port 110.\n\n481\n00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.470\nIt's TCP because we need\nguarantee delivery of that email,\n\n482\n00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:48.950\nso TCP 110 is going to be used for POP3.\n\n483\n00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:52.610\nPOP3 doesn't support sub folders and\nso a lot of people really want that so\n\n484\n00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.470\nwe see people move away from POP3.\n\n485\n00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:59.340\nIt's very fast very efficient but\nit's plain text, so\n\n486\n00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.760\nyour email is at risk,\nSMTP is plain text too.\n\n487\n00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.070\nAll this stuff was created back\nwhen the Internet was a safe place,\n\n488\n00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.900\nwhere it was a little more trustworthy.\n\n489\n00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.120\nUnlike today,\nwhere it's completely untrustworthy and\n\n490\n00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.490\nyou want to use secure\nprotocols whenever you can.\n\n491\n00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:17.060\nSo there is a secure version of POP where\nthey stuck TLS on it to use encryption,\n\n492\n00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.190\nand encrypting the old protocol.\n\n493\n00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:21.501\nSo the old protocol is still the same,\nit's just being put on top of a tunnel to\n\n494\n00:26:21.501 --> 00:26:24.160\nsecure it and\nwe'll see that on the next page.\n\n495\n00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:28.820\nSeveral protocols that I just\nmentioned have a secure versions.\n\n496\n00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:35.290\nRight, so POP, so I've got port 995\nright here, that's POP over SSL/TLS.\n\n497\n00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:40.995\nRight now not all these SSL/TLS, they used\nto just say SSL, secure socket layer.\n\n498\n00:26:40.995 --> 00:26:45.551\nWe had secure socket layer\nversion 1,1.1 and 1.2 and\n\n499\n00:26:45.551 --> 00:26:48.595\nwhat happened was SSL got compromised.\n\n500\n00:26:48.595 --> 00:26:52.143\nIt's a compromised protocol,\nSSL is no longer safe to use.\n\n501\n00:26:52.143 --> 00:26:56.579\nSo it got replaced by new protocol TLS,\ntransport layer security.\n\n502\n00:26:56.579 --> 00:27:01.286\nTransport layer security supports a much\nstronger version of encryption it is much\n\n503\n00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:03.850\nsafer to use, so it's replaced SSL.\n\n504\n00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:08.600\nYou shouldn't be using SSL anywhere on\nyour network anymore, at all, period.\n\n505\n00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.660\nYou shouldn't be using it, right?\n\n506\n00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:11.760\nWhen you browse the Internet,\n\n507\n00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.210\nall the websites out there should\nhave already moved to TLS.\n\n508\n00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:17.740\nThe problem is, in the end user's eye,\n\n509\n00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.530\nthey've been using the term\nSSL all this time.\n\n510\n00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:24.840\nSecure socket layer, it's a secure\nconnection, TLS, what is that, right?\n\n511\n00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.370\nSo even though we moved to\nTLS they keep the SSL name\n\n512\n00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:31.280\naround cuz people recognize it,\npeople know what it means.\n\n513\n00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.670\nBut you shouldn't be running SSL anymore,\n\n514\n00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.140\nyou should be running TLS and\nmost everybody is.\n\n515\n00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:41.710\nSo when we look at these it's\ncalled HTTP over SSL or HTTPS.\n\n516\n00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.620\nBut it's actually HTTP over TLS now,\nright.\n\n517\n00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:48.560\nIt's just the implementation is\na little different on the back end.\n\n518\n00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.880\nIt uses port 443 for secure web traffic.\n\n519\n00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.700\n587 I mentioned for SMTP.\n\n520\n00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:58.270\nYou've also got 465, I should have\nlisted both here on the slide.\n\n521\n00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:00.586\nHere I'll add 587 there.\n\n522\n00:28:00.586 --> 00:28:04.693\nSo you've got both of those,\nwe've got 993 for iMAP.\n\n523\n00:28:04.693 --> 00:28:06.470\nActually, I never talked\nabout unencrypted iMAP.\n\n524\n00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:10.590\nUnencrypted iMAP I've got right here\nis 143 that's the Internet message\n\n525\n00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:15.560\naccess protocol, and it is just like\nPOP3 except it does support sub folders.\n\n526\n00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.358\nYou can synchronize individual folders you\ncan categorize things it's really nice.\n\n527\n00:28:18.358 --> 00:28:22.622\nIt's a lot more robust than POP3 is so\niMAP version 4 or\n\n528\n00:28:22.622 --> 00:28:28.457\niMAP4 is more common than POP these\ndays just because it's more powerful.\n\n529\n00:28:28.457 --> 00:28:32.313\nAll right, we've got\nNetwork News Transfer Protocol, NNTP.\n\n530\n00:28:32.313 --> 00:28:35.264\nI'm not sure why this one's on\nthe exam objectives because nobody\n\n531\n00:28:35.264 --> 00:28:36.378\nreally uses it anymore.\n\n532\n00:28:36.378 --> 00:28:40.370\nIt's what we used to use before\nyou had Internet forums and\n\n533\n00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:45.991\nbulletin boards on web pages, you had a\nseparate protocol for news and posting and\n\n534\n00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:51.232\nsharing things, it's all kind of\ngone away now, but it's on port 119.\n\n535\n00:28:51.232 --> 00:28:54.816\nNetwork time protocol, NTP,\nNTP is super important.\n\n536\n00:28:54.816 --> 00:28:58.120\nA lot of encryption uses time stamps\nto make sure your data hasn't been\n\n537\n00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:58.904\ntampered with.\n\n538\n00:28:58.904 --> 00:29:02.721\nAnd if you're using time stamps you gotta\nmake sure your systems have the same time.\n\n539\n00:29:02.721 --> 00:29:06.575\nAnd a network time server, using network\ntime protocol can help ensure that.\n\n540\n00:29:06.575 --> 00:29:10.804\nSo most operating systems come configured\nto use an network time server by default.\n\n541\n00:29:10.804 --> 00:29:13.283\nAnd you can set up your own or\nuse the ones on the Internet.\n\n542\n00:29:13.283 --> 00:29:18.771\nBut when you synchronize time, you need\nto synchronize time fast, so you use UDP.\n\n543\n00:29:18.771 --> 00:29:21.191\nIf you lose a message synchronizing time,\n\n544\n00:29:21.191 --> 00:29:25.300\nyou don't wanna get an old copy of\nthat message it's already obsolete.\n\n545\n00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.746\nSo you just throw it away and\nmove on and you bring the next one in.\n\n546\n00:29:27.746 --> 00:29:31.874\nSo NTP uses UDP by default\nbecause it's time sensitive,\n\n547\n00:29:31.874 --> 00:29:34.372\nit's the network time protocol.\n\n548\n00:29:34.372 --> 00:29:37.702\nAnd it's on port 123,\neasy to remember that one.\n\n549\n00:29:37.702 --> 00:29:42.349\nNetBIOS, NetBIOS, well,\nit was really used with NetBEUI and\n\n550\n00:29:42.349 --> 00:29:45.250\nold Intel-Microsoft protocol.\n\n551\n00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.490\nBut it's still used on modern networks.\n\n552\n00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:52.140\nIf you're using Samba on Linux and\nyou've got Windows file shares in place,\n\n553\n00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:55.590\nyou'll use NetBIOS to locate\nmachines on the network.\n\n554\n00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:59.288\nNetBIOS uses TCP and UDP and\nit runs on port 139.\n\n555\n00:30:01.656 --> 00:30:04.530\nAll right, SNMP,\nsimple network management protocol.\n\n556\n00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:07.720\nThis is one that is starting to go away.\n\n557\n00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.780\nIt is the defacto standard for gathering\ndata about your servers on the network.\n\n558\n00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:15.120\nDo you want to know how much bandwidth\nyour server's consuming right now?\n\n559\n00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.200\nHow much CPU utilization is getting?\n\n560\n00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.094\nWhat temperature your hard drives are?\n\n561\n00:30:20.094 --> 00:30:22.239\nYou can use SNMP to query all that data.\n\n562\n00:30:22.239 --> 00:30:26.200\nYou can also use SNMP to send alerts,\nright, sending messages out,\n\n563\n00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.068\nhey I got high CPU usage,\nso I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n564\n00:30:29.068 --> 00:30:32.580\npush that message out to warn\nyou about it, SNMP can do that.\n\n565\n00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.895\nThe problem is SNMP doesn't have\na lot of security built into it.\n\n566\n00:30:34.895 --> 00:30:38.691\nAnd so it's being replaced by\nother technologies like WMI and\n\n567\n00:30:38.691 --> 00:30:42.999\nother RPC type look-ups that are out\nthere and third-party agents.\n\n568\n00:30:42.999 --> 00:30:46.788\nSo while SNMP is out there and\nsupported by most operating systems,\n\n569\n00:30:46.788 --> 00:30:51.790\nit's kind of on the downward slope of its\nlife cycle, it's starting to go away.\n\n570\n00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:54.260\nBut it uses UDP on port 161.\n\n571\n00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:58.160\nAgain, if I don't get the data in\nthe first try, the data is now obsolete,\n\n572\n00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.920\nI might as well get a new set of data, so\nwe just repeat the request, it uses UDP.\n\n573\n00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:07.750\nLet's see, I already talked about HTTP,\nSMTP, IMAP and POP so\n\n574\n00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:09.280\nthat's kind of a secure versions.\n\n575\n00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.380\nAnd again all these ports\nare in the show notes,\n\n576\n00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.840\nso don't feel like you gonna jot\nthem down right here offhand.\n\n577\n00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:18.980\nLast grouping here, I know it's not\nthe most exciting thing on the planet.\n\n578\n00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:23.120\nThe last few are the interesting ones\nbecause they're higher numbers, right?\n\n579\n00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:27.690\nNumbers that get outside of that\n1023 limit that we saw earlier.\n\n580\n00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:31.300\nMicrosoft has a protocol called\nremote desktop protocol or RDP.\n\n581\n00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.340\nIt let's me remotely view the screen,\ntypically of a server.\n\n582\n00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.370\nI wanna be able to remotely\nconnect to a server.\n\n583\n00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:40.050\nI don't wanna get up and go into\nthe server room, it's noisy in there,\n\n584\n00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:41.030\nand it's cold.\n\n585\n00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:43.900\nI wanna sit at my desk where it's nice and\nquiet, and warm, right?\n\n586\n00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.860\nAnd I wanna remote in and not have\nto stand up, because I don't know,\n\n587\n00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:50.881\nI went to college so\nI wouldn't have to stand at work.\n\n588\n00:31:50.881 --> 00:31:52.911\nSo, [LAUGH] I say that, and\nthen here I am standing at work.\n\n589\n00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:57.012\nSo, anyhow, but the point is, I wanna be\nable to remotely connect in to manage\n\n590\n00:31:57.012 --> 00:31:59.019\nthese systems, and RDP lets me do it.\n\n591\n00:31:59.019 --> 00:32:05.210\nRDP uses TCP port 3389 so we can\nconnect right out and get on that one.\n\n592\n00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:07.370\nVNC is another one that we can use.\n\n593\n00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:08.850\nWe use that a lot more with Linux servers,\n\n594\n00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:11.410\nif you have a GUI that\nyou wanna connect to.\n\n595\n00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:16.017\nIt uses 5900, not on the exam objectives\nthough, so I didn't put it on the slides.\n\n596\n00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:20.790\nBut just for your own reference,\nVNC uses TCP port 5900.\n\n597\n00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.868\nNotice that they both use TCP, and\nthat's because as they stream,\n\n598\n00:32:23.868 --> 00:32:27.378\nyou're viewing the desktop and\nthey don't want you to miss things, right,\n\n599\n00:32:27.378 --> 00:32:28.962\ncuz you're managing the server.\n\n600\n00:32:28.962 --> 00:32:31.733\nNow, the reality is on Windows and\nLinux these days,\n\n601\n00:32:31.733 --> 00:32:34.100\nI don't normally remote with a GUI.\n\n602\n00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.430\nI usually remote with a shell.\n\n603\n00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.355\nSo on Linux, it's SSH.\n\n604\n00:32:37.355 --> 00:32:39.938\nOn Windows, it's PowerShell or\nWin RM, right?\n\n605\n00:32:39.938 --> 00:32:43.640\nThat's how you can connect and get a shell\nand work with those things and not a GUI.\n\n606\n00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.790\nOr you have management utilities\ninstalled on your client, and\n\n607\n00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:48.400\nyou use those utilities to connect.\n\n608\n00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.930\nSo pulling up a remote desktop like\nthis isn't something I use for\n\n609\n00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.690\nservers a whole lot anymore.\n\n610\n00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:54.660\nWe used to use it a ton,\nnot so much anymore.\n\n611\n00:32:56.682 --> 00:33:00.225\nAll right, I mentioned FTP, and\nnow FTP can be done over SSL.\n\n612\n00:33:00.225 --> 00:33:04.111\nWell, didn't we already talk about this,\nFTP over SSH?\n\n613\n00:33:04.111 --> 00:33:07.740\nIt's actually two different standards,\nand it's really easy to confuse these.\n\n614\n00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.416\nThere's SFTP and FTPS.\n\n615\n00:33:11.416 --> 00:33:16.895\nSFTP is secure file transfer protocol,\nFTP over SSH.\n\n616\n00:33:16.895 --> 00:33:21.384\nFTPS is FTP over SSL,\nSecure Socket Layer, right, or\n\n617\n00:33:21.384 --> 00:33:24.808\nreally,TLS, and that's called FTPS.\n\n618\n00:33:24.808 --> 00:33:28.285\nFTPS uses port 989 and 990, right?\n\n619\n00:33:28.285 --> 00:33:32.411\n990 for commands, 989 for transfers,\nand that's what it's using for\n\n620\n00:33:32.411 --> 00:33:33.611\nthat communication.\n\n621\n00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:36.581\nSFTP used port 22 cuz it was SSH.\n\n622\n00:33:36.581 --> 00:33:41.683\nNow, I'll tell you guys, SFTP, very,\nvery common, used all over the place.\n\n623\n00:33:41.683 --> 00:33:43.990\nFTPS, pretty rare, right?\n\n624\n00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:46.120\nThere's not a lot of\nFTPS servers out there.\n\n625\n00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:50.140\nThere's tons of FTPS clients,\nbut not a lot of FTPS servers.\n\n626\n00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.120\nSo this one is definitely\nthe least common of the two.\n\n627\n00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.452\nSFTP is far more common.\n\n628\n00:33:55.452 --> 00:34:00.386\nAnd the last one I have is LDAP,\nthe Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.\n\n629\n00:34:00.386 --> 00:34:01.835\nThis is another weird one.\n\n630\n00:34:01.835 --> 00:34:06.006\nIf you're running the Microsoft Active\nDirectory or if you're running Open LDAP\n\n631\n00:34:06.006 --> 00:34:09.816\nfor centralized user accounts,\nthen you're gonna have an LDAP server and\n\n632\n00:34:09.816 --> 00:34:12.129\nit's gonna be listening\non these two ports.\n\n633\n00:34:12.129 --> 00:34:14.543\nWell, it's definitely gonna\nbe listening on one of them,\n\n634\n00:34:14.543 --> 00:34:16.003\nit might be listening on the other.\n\n635\n00:34:16.003 --> 00:34:17.933\nThe first port is 389.\n\n636\n00:34:17.933 --> 00:34:20.430\n389 is where we do our LDAP lookups.\n\n637\n00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.430\nIf I'm querying for user account settings,\nquerying for permissions,\n\n638\n00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:28.040\nif I'm authenticating,\nI send all of that over\n\n639\n00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.890\nport 389 to communicate with\nthat directory server, right?\n\n640\n00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:34.653\nSo that's the most important one,\nbut directories can get big.\n\n641\n00:34:34.653 --> 00:34:36.027\nThey can get really big.\n\n642\n00:34:36.027 --> 00:34:38.377\nAnd in an enterprise environment,\nthe directory can get so\n\n643\n00:34:38.377 --> 00:34:40.870\nlarge that querying it\nbecomes a bit of a burden.\n\n644\n00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:45.700\nAnd so in those scenarios, we might break\nour directory up into multiple segments,\n\n645\n00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:47.110\nright, sections.\n\n646\n00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:50.180\nIn Microsoft's Active Directory,\nthey call it creating separate domains and\n\n647\n00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:54.140\neven separate forests, so you could start\ndividing that directory up quite a bit.\n\n648\n00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:58.930\nIn OpenLDAP, you can do the same thing as\nseparate Kerberos realms or domains and\n\n649\n00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.190\ndivide it that way.\n\n650\n00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:04.986\nWhen you do that, you can do a query\nagainst an individual piece of that\n\n651\n00:35:04.986 --> 00:35:07.602\nenvironment but not the whole thing.\n\n652\n00:35:07.602 --> 00:35:11.607\nAnd so to do a query against the whole\nthing, a summary is created,\n\n653\n00:35:11.607 --> 00:35:13.905\na summary of the entire environment.\n\n654\n00:35:13.905 --> 00:35:16.972\nAnd that summary's called\na global catalog, and\n\n655\n00:35:16.972 --> 00:35:20.121\nthe global catalog is\nlistening on port 3268.\n\n656\n00:35:20.121 --> 00:35:23.917\nSo if you have a directory server\nthat's also a global catalog server,\n\n657\n00:35:23.917 --> 00:35:25.949\nit'll listen on both of those ports.\n\n658\n00:35:25.949 --> 00:35:28.650\nBut if you have a directory server\nthat's not a global catalog,\n\n659\n00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:30.661\nit's only gonna listen on 389, all right?\n\n660\n00:35:30.661 --> 00:35:34.360\nSo there is two ports but\nyou may not always use both of them.\n\n661\n00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.270\nAnd both of them listen on TCP and UDP.\n\n662\n00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:38.507\nIt's kinda like DNS.\n\n663\n00:35:38.507 --> 00:35:45.555\nIf the query'll fit inside of UDP,\none packet, it'll use it.\n\n664\n00:35:45.555 --> 00:35:47.686\nIf it's too big, we'll switch to TCP.\n\n665\n00:35:47.686 --> 00:35:51.985\nA lot of systems just use TCP by default,\nbecause if I'm trying to authenticate,\n\n666\n00:35:51.985 --> 00:35:53.683\nit's not gonna get out of sync.\n\n667\n00:35:53.683 --> 00:35:56.771\nIf I just do a single retransmitter or\na couple of retransmits,\n\n668\n00:35:56.771 --> 00:36:00.970\nwe have to get more than five minutes out\nof the sync to really cause a problem.\n\n669\n00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:05.300\nAnd a TCP retransmit, if it's exceeding\nfive minutes, you got bigger problems.\n\n670\n00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.820\nYou've got a physical network issue there.\n\n671\n00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.150\nSo that's not too big of a deal there.\n\n672\n00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.910\nAll right, so\nI know that's not the most exciting thing.\n\n673\n00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:16.250\nBut what we did is we just ran through\nthe protocols that commT expects\n\n674\n00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.760\nyou to know, right?\n\n675\n00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.595\nThese are the common protocols, and we're\ngonna see more of these all throughout\n\n676\n00:36:19.595 --> 00:36:23.130\nthis series as we configure services and\nimplement things on the network.\n\n677\n00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:26.310\nThe reason we need to know them is that,\nfirst off,\n\n678\n00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:28.300\nwe gotta set up the server,\nso there's that.\n\n679\n00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:32.170\nSecondly, you probably have\na software firewall on your server.\n\n680\n00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:36.060\nSomething like firewall D or IP Tables,\nthe Windows firewall, whatever.\n\n681\n00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.590\nAnd you're gonna have to open ports there.\n\n682\n00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:40.900\nYou probably have a hardware firewall that\nyou need to be able to configure to open\n\n683\n00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.360\nup these ports and make them available.\n\n684\n00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.540\nYou probably have nat mappings that\nyou've gotta configure to forward these\n\n685\n00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.460\nports appropriately.\n\n686\n00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.280\nThese are all parts of implementing\na new server where you need\n\n687\n00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.060\nto understand what your\nservices are using.\n\n688\n00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.040\nIf you forget them,\nyou're just a search away from finding it.\n\n689\n00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.280\nAnd if you're using third-party software,\nthey typically have guides that give you\n\n690\n00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.380\nall the information you need for\nconfiguring it.\n\n691\n00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:02.050\nBut on the exam, they want you\nto have these memorized, right?\n\n692\n00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.910\nThe standard common ports,\n\n693\n00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:06.409\nall the ones that we just went through,\nyou should now those by heart.\n\n694\n00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:09.635\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Don,\nthere's nothing like a laundry list for\n\n695\n00:37:09.635 --> 00:37:11.105\nmemorization on any exam for sure.\n\n696\n00:37:11.105 --> 00:37:13.443\nBut boy,\ndo they keep coming up over and over.\n\n697\n00:37:13.443 --> 00:37:16.929\nJust about every exam I think I've taken\nhas had ports on it at least at one\n\n698\n00:37:16.929 --> 00:37:17.681\npoint or time.\n\n699\n00:37:17.681 --> 00:37:20.161\nNow Don, it does look like we're\ncoming to the end of another episode.\n\n700\n00:37:20.161 --> 00:37:22.710\nBut before we do, do you have any\nadditional piece of advice or\n\n701\n00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:24.780\nwords of wisdom you might\nwanna give our viewers?\n\n702\n00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] In the show notes, I've got\na table that lists all these ports.\n\n703\n00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:29.380\nIt really does come down to memorization.\n\n704\n00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:30.890\nJust look at them and memorize them.\n\n705\n00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:33.480\nOdds are, like Wes said, you've\nalready seen them in other exams, so\n\n706\n00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.510\nyou should be at least briefly familiar\nwith them, so it shouldn't be a big deal.\n\n707\n00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.970\nBut these are easy questions\nto get right on the exam, so\n\n708\n00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:41.550\njust memorize the table and\nyou'll be ready to rock.\n\n709\n00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:44.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, that looks like\nit's a good place to wrap this one up.\n\n710\n00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:46.670\nDon, we appreciate you being\nhere in the studios, and\n\n711\n00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:48.300\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n712\n00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.254\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n713\n00:37:51.254 --> 00:37:52.054\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n714\n00:37:52.054 -->

ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:16.147\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:16.147 --> 00:00:19.130\nAnd in today's episode we're continuing\nthrough our server plus series,\n\n8\n00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.345\nand we're gonna be talking about a topic\ntoday that really could be a nightmare for\n\n9\n00:00:22.345 --> 00:00:24.915\nsome if you don't get it right,\nand that's cable management.\n\n10\n00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:27.835\nThank goodness we have our super\nguru in the house today, Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:29.055\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:30.685\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great Wes,\nand I'm really excited for\n\n13\n00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:32.215\nthis show cuz it's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n14\n00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:33.056\nAnd the main reason is?\n\n15\n00:00:33.056 --> 00:00:33.884\nI brought toys.\n\n16\n00:00:33.884 --> 00:00:36.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I brought piles of stuff\n\n17\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.210\nbehind me here to show on this episode.\n\n18\n00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.662\nWe're gonna be taking a look\nat some of the cables and\n\n19\n00:00:40.662 --> 00:00:43.072\ncable types that are used\nin a typical data center.\n\n20\n00:00:43.072 --> 00:00:45.571\nAnd we're gonna talk a little bit\nabout how those cables are run and\n\n21\n00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:47.285\nmanaged in solani in that environment.\n\n22\n00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:51.145\nIt's a little bit different than how\nyou might do it in your office or home.\n\n23\n00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:54.735\nWhen you're in a data center there's a lot\nof things we have to be concerned with and\n\n24\n00:00:54.735 --> 00:00:56.435\nwe've gotta make sure that\nwe manage things properly.\n\n25\n00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:58.585\nSo, we're gonna get\na chance to see all that,\n\n26\n00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:02.415\nmake sure we've got a good grasp on all\nthe things that Comte expects us to know.\n\n27\n00:01:02.415 --> 00:01:05.185\nNow, where I wanna start is with\n\n28\n00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:07.770\nthe cabling types that\nare really the most common.\n\n29\n00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.770\nWhen you've got a server rack,\nlike the racks that are behind us here,\n\n30\n00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.710\nwe've got a number of\nservers that are hooked up.\n\n31\n00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.410\nThe most common type of cabling\nthat you're gonna be using is\n\n32\n00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.070\ncopper Ethernet cabling.\n\n33\n00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.350\nRight, and we refer to it as UTP or\n\n34\n00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.730\nunshielded twisted pair, which is kind\nof a descriptor of how that cable works.\n\n35\n00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.817\nBut really what it is at the end of\nthe day, is a plastic sheathing and\n\n36\n00:01:27.817 --> 00:01:30.424\ninside of it you have\neight a copper wires.\n\n37\n00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:33.030\nAnd then they're all insulated from\neach other so you don't get crosstalk.\n\n38\n00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.200\nAnd there's different\ntypes of that cabling.\n\n39\n00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.020\nAnd it all looks the same, but\n\n40\n00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.550\ninside it's actually manufactured\na little bit differently.\n\n41\n00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.210\nAnd so CompTIA wants to make sure that\nwe've got a good understanding of that\n\n42\n00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.230\ncopper cabling and\n\n43\n00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.950\nwe're using the right kind when\nwe're connecting servers together.\n\n44\n00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.950\nAnd wiring up a rack and\ngetting things hooked up, right?\n\n45\n00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.900\nSo the first kinda\ndifferentiation I wanna make is,\n\n46\n00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.640\nI mentioned there's eight\nwires inside of these cables.\n\n47\n00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.900\nWhen we plug in a server,\nyou can grab a cable that looks fine but\n\n48\n00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.190\nis actually different than\nwhat you expect it to be.\n\n49\n00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.570\nAnd let me show you guys an example\nto kind of drive this point home.\n\n50\n00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.020\nI've got a few different cables\nlaying around back here.\n\n51\n00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.660\nJust bring up a few examples.\n\n52\n00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.580\nSo, what I'm looking at right here,\nthis is a small link,\n\n53\n00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.340\na little bit more than a foot.\n\n54\n00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.686\nActually, what is this, category 6?\n\n55\n00:02:21.686 --> 00:02:25.240\nYeah, this is category 6 unshielded\ntwisted pair of cabling.\n\n56\n00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.710\nAll right,\nthat name unshielded twisted pair,\n\n57\n00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.120\nif you're not familiar with it,\ncomes from, well first, it's unshielded.\n\n58\n00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.460\nBack in the old days wherein coaxial\ncable, a lot of coaxial cable had a tin\n\n59\n00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.100\nfoil layer inside that wrapped around\nits core and that was the shielding.\n\n60\n00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.558\nWe don't have that anymore.\n\n61\n00:02:40.558 --> 00:02:44.264\nWe don't have that because with coaxial\ncable you have a single copper core that\n\n62\n00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:46.540\nruns through the middle of the cable.\n\n63\n00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.270\nBut when you've got\ntwisted pair like this,\n\n64\n00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.600\nwe've got a number of cables inside of it.\n\n65\n00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.100\nAnd here, I'm gonna take,\nwe're gonna go dangerous today.\n\n66\n00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.202\nI'm gonna take a razor blade and\ncut this open so\n\n67\n00:02:56.202 --> 00:02:58.420\nwe can kind of see what it\nlooks like on the inside.\n\n68\n00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.090\nAnd what we're gonna see here\nare the eight wires that are inside of it.\n\n69\n00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.402\nAnd they're twisted together and\nthey're twisted oddly enough into pairs.\n\n70\n00:03:09.402 --> 00:03:11.990\nRight, so\nthat's where the unshielded twisted pair,\n\n71\n00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.460\npart of that name, comes from.\n\n72\n00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.270\nSo, when you look at that,\nwe've got blue, green, orange,\n\n73\n00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.310\nand brown, twisted together.\n\n74\n00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.350\nAnd there's a white wire\ntwisted with each one, and\n\n75\n00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.880\nthe white actually has a little\nbit of color to it also.\n\n76\n00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.830\nSo, the one that's wrapped\naround green here,\n\n77\n00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.700\nis probably the easiest to see on camera.\n\n78\n00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.310\nIf we take a look at that one.\n\n79\n00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.730\nThe white cable isn't just white,\n\n80\n00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.440\nit's actually white with little splashes\nof green on it every here and there.\n\n81\n00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.480\nTo show you that that's the white\ncable that pairs up with the green.\n\n82\n00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.380\nAnd that twist keeps electrical\ninterference out of the cable.\n\n83\n00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.990\nWhen you have a cable run through a wall\nor a rack or near lighting or whatever,\n\n84\n00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.520\nyou can get a lot of electromagnetic\ninterference into the cable itself.\n\n85\n00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.920\nAnd so by having that twist,\nit prevents it.\n\n86\n00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.080\nAnd that twist also makes\nit where we don't need that\n\n87\n00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.800\nfoil wrapping around it\nlike we had with coax.\n\n88\n00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.430\nIf I were to take a coaxial cable and\n\n89\n00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.320\ncut it open, which I've got\na length of around here somewhere.\n\n90\n00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.190\nIf I were to cut that open you'd actually\nsee a little piece of tin foil that wraps\n\n91\n00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.010\naround the core that\nisolates that cable and\n\n92\n00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.650\nmakes sure that we don't get\ninterference that way, all right.\n\n93\n00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.320\nNow, as far as the wires,\nthere's eight wires in there.\n\n94\n00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.316\nAnd if I look at terminated cable, so\nhere is a terminated cable here is one\n\n95\n00:04:20.316 --> 00:04:24.520\nis ready to be used on a server is\ngot RJ-45 jacks that are stuck on it.\n\n96\n00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.770\nI can plug that right\ninto a network adapter,\n\n97\n00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.620\nI can plug this on into a switch or\na wall and I'm ready to go, right?\n\n98\n00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.894\nWell, I've gotta pay attention to\nwhat's going on inside of that cable.\n\n99\n00:04:35.894 --> 00:04:38.640\nThe wires are arranged in a certain order,\nand\n\n100\n00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.900\nthat order influences how\nthis cable functions.\n\n101\n00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.210\nNow when I look at this one,\nthe connector on the left and\n\n102\n00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.970\nthe connector on the right\nare in the same order.\n\n103\n00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.760\nSo I've got white orange orange,\nwhite green blue, white blue green,\n\n104\n00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.540\nwhite brown brown,\non both connectors in that same order.\n\n105\n00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.800\nSo this is what's considered\na straight-through cable, and\n\n106\n00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.650\nwith a cable like this,\nthis is what we use to connect a server or\n\n107\n00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.250\nworkstation or laptop to a switch, right?\n\n108\n00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.675\nThis is what we connect\na device to a switch.\n\n109\n00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:13.120\nNow, there are scenarios where the cables\nare in different orders on the two sides.\n\n110\n00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.540\nAnd when they're in a different order,\n\n111\n00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.690\nwhat you're normally looking at is\nwhat's called a crossover cable.\n\n112\n00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.250\nA crossover cable is designed to connect\na computer directly to another computer.\n\n113\n00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.290\nComputers don't expect to be\nplugged directly into each other.\n\n114\n00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.060\nThey expect there to be a switch or\na hub in between them.\n\n115\n00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.770\nBut if you're just running\nbetween two machines,\n\n116\n00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.790\na crossover cable is actually\nflipping two of the wires.\n\n117\n00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.310\nAnd let me show you\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n118\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.300\nWhen you look at a straight through cable,\nit looks like this,\n\n119\n00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.010\nsee how you've got white green green,\nwhite orange blue.\n\n120\n00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.073\nThis is a different standard and what I\nsaid a moment ago is the 568B standard,\n\n121\n00:05:48.073 --> 00:05:49.946\non the slide here I've got 568A.\n\n122\n00:05:49.946 --> 00:05:50.932\nIt's another standard,\n\n123\n00:05:50.932 --> 00:05:53.940\nthey've effectively work the same\nwhen it comes to patch cables.\n\n124\n00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:00.680\nBut the transmits on one side are supposed\nto be mapped to the receive on the other\n\n125\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.680\nside, and the receive on one side is\nmapped to the transmit from the other.\n\n126\n00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.430\nSo one side is transmitting to the others\nreceiver, that's what you would expect.\n\n127\n00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.850\nAnd one side is receiving what\nthe other is transmitting.\n\n128\n00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.290\nWell if you look at it here,\nit's not like that, is it?\n\n129\n00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.900\nMy cables run to the same\nplace on each side.\n\n130\n00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.255\nSo my transmit on one side would be\nrunning to the transmit on the other side.\n\n131\n00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:23.420\nWe'd both be transmitting with each\nother and we'd get a collision.\n\n132\n00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.540\nSo that doesn't work.\n\n133\n00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.955\nWell, switches expect that.\n\n134\n00:06:26.955 --> 00:06:29.940\nSwitches expecting you to be communicating\nthat way and they are ready to receive it.\n\n135\n00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:30.685\nSo are hubs.\n\n136\n00:06:30.685 --> 00:06:32.700\nBut another computer isn't.\n\n137\n00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.810\nSo if we're running a cable\ndirectly between computers,\n\n138\n00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.610\nwe'll have to do a crossover.\n\n139\n00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.080\nAnd with the crossover here\nyou can see where pins one and\n\n140\n00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.190\ntwo don't just run right to pin one and\ntwo over on the the other side.\n\n141\n00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.380\nInstead pin one and\ntwo run over here to pins three and six.\n\n142\n00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.470\nThe transmits on one side are mapped\nto the receive on the other.\n\n143\n00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.600\nNow if I just run into the server,\ninto the storage closet and\n\n144\n00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.830\ngrab a cable real quick, I'm like,\n\n145\n00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.310\nhere I got this, I can go plug it\ninto my servers, it might not work.\n\n146\n00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.660\nBecause it could be a straight through\ncable or it could be a crossover cable.\n\n147\n00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.550\nYou've gotta look at\nthe connector to verify.\n\n148\n00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.070\n&gt;&gt; Don with that crossover cable,\nessentially is it right to say that\n\n149\n00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.220\nthe crossover cable is essentially\ndoing what the switch would be doing?\n\n150\n00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.790\nWhen it comes to forwarding\ninformation from transmit and\n\n151\n00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.260\nreceive, it's crossing itself so it's\nkind of acting like the switch with out\n\n152\n00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.860\nactually doing any\ncommunications switching.\n\n153\n00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,\nyou don't get the buffering,\n\n154\n00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.810\nyou don't get the Mac\naddress table look ups.\n\n155\n00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.600\nBut you don't need that when it's a point\nto point cable between two nodes.\n\n156\n00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.520\nIt just gets them connected quick and\ndirty and off you go.\n\n157\n00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.010\nSo very simple, very easy to get up and\nrunning and off you go.\n\n158\n00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.910\nBut typically we're not gonna\nuse crossover cables, right?\n\n159\n00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.050\nWhen you're in a data center,\nyou've got switches.\n\n160\n00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.345\nWe usually have a switch at\nthe top of every rack and\n\n161\n00:07:46.345 --> 00:07:49.365\nthen those switches all aggregate\ninto a core switch somewhere.\n\n162\n00:07:49.365 --> 00:07:50.583\nWe don't usually use crossover cables.\n\n163\n00:07:50.583 --> 00:07:54.222\nNow, if you're running switch to switch,\nyou use a crossover cable then.\n\n164\n00:07:54.222 --> 00:07:57.246\nBut most switches these\ndays do what's called MDIX.\n\n165\n00:07:57.246 --> 00:07:59.740\nThey’ll detect when they\nshould do a crossover and\n\n166\n00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.227\nthey'll just automatically do it in\ntheir hardware, on the back end.\n\n167\n00:08:03.227 --> 00:08:05.054\nSo, you don't even have\nto worry about it there.\n\n168\n00:08:05.054 --> 00:08:06.908\nSo crossover cables are really\nkind of a dying thing.\n\n169\n00:08:06.908 --> 00:08:09.375\nWe just don't have that much of a need for\nthem anymore,\n\n170\n00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:12.650\nunless you're doing simple\nlaptop migration or something.\n\n171\n00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.813\n&gt;&gt; Don, we had a great question\nthat come across the chatroom.\n\n172\n00:08:14.813 --> 00:08:17.854\nYou mentioned that term 568A and B.\n\n173\n00:08:17.854 --> 00:08:20.636\nCould you see where maybe one\nwould be used over the other, and\n\n174\n00:08:20.636 --> 00:08:22.475\nmaybe explain a little bit about that?\n\n175\n00:08:22.475 --> 00:08:24.339\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.\nSo, when you make a crossover cable,\n\n176\n00:08:24.339 --> 00:08:27.980\nyou're making one end 568A, and\nyou're making the other end 568B.\n\n177\n00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.847\nBut when you're dealing with\na straight through cable,\n\n178\n00:08:31.847 --> 00:08:35.081\nboth ends are 568A or both ends are 568B.\n\n179\n00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:35.852\nDoesn't matter which one.\n\n180\n00:08:35.852 --> 00:08:37.553\nYou pick one and you're happy with it.\n\n181\n00:08:37.553 --> 00:08:40.440\nSo, when you do that,\nyou've got a straight through cable, but\n\n182\n00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.360\nwhy have the two standards?\n\n183\n00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.680\nIs one better than the other?\n\n184\n00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.897\nThe short answer is,\nas far as most people are concerned,\n\n185\n00:08:46.897 --> 00:08:49.560\nthere's not really much difference, right?\n\n186\n00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:54.044\nBut what you'll find out there in\nthe real world is that when people run\n\n187\n00:08:54.044 --> 00:08:57.920\ncabling through the wall,\nthey call it structured wiring or\n\n188\n00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.346\nthings that are built in,\nthey run 568A for that.\n\n189\n00:09:01.346 --> 00:09:05.517\nBecause it's a little bit better as far\nas getting the full distance reliably and\n\n190\n00:09:05.517 --> 00:09:09.565\ndefeating some of the interference that\nyou have in fluorescent lighting, so\n\n191\n00:09:09.565 --> 00:09:12.740\nyou'll see 560A run in\nwalls pretty commonly.\n\n192\n00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.254\nBut then standard patch cables\nthat we make or that we buy and\n\n193\n00:09:16.254 --> 00:09:20.141\nwe run from server to server,\nthese are typically done 568B.\n\n194\n00:09:20.141 --> 00:09:23.469\nAnd they're not normally run in a wall,\nthey are just run out in the open or\n\n195\n00:09:23.469 --> 00:09:26.950\nthrough a cable management arm,\nand 568B does great with that.\n\n196\n00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:31.890\nBut at the end of the day, if you're just\ntalking about a 12 or 25 foot cable,\n\n197\n00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.595\na couple of meters or whatever,\nit doesn't really matter,\n\n198\n00:09:35.595 --> 00:09:37.575\nyou could do either standards.\n\n199\n00:09:37.575 --> 00:09:39.162\nYou can do the same performance out of it.\n\n200\n00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:42.625\nBut we have the two standards really for\nthe crossover side of things,\n\n201\n00:09:42.625 --> 00:09:46.455\n568A on one side 568B on the other,\nthat gets to your cross over cable.\n\n202\n00:09:46.455 --> 00:09:49.150\n&gt;&gt; Now, you've also talked about,\nin past episodes, documentation.\n\n203\n00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.374\nWould it be a good thing that\nif you're gonna use one or\n\n204\n00:09:51.374 --> 00:09:54.638\nthe other that you document that so that\nif anybody else is coming in helping you\n\n205\n00:09:54.638 --> 00:09:58.170\nassist work on the network, somebody who's\naware of what standard you're using.\n\n206\n00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.896\nOr is it just as simple\nas looking at the cables?\n\n207\n00:10:00.896 --> 00:10:03.334\n&gt;&gt; You could,\nsome people are really picky about it.\n\n208\n00:10:03.334 --> 00:10:05.633\nBut, since it doesn't really matter,\n\n209\n00:10:05.633 --> 00:10:10.245\nI don't really care if somebody runs\n568A for a patch cable and I ran 568B.\n\n210\n00:10:10.245 --> 00:10:14.314\nAs long as it's right within that\ncable itself, that's all I care about.\n\n211\n00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:16.412\nSo, I don't normally\nworry about it that much.\n\n212\n00:10:16.412 --> 00:10:21.098\nBut you might be more of a stickler than\nI am, and then that's certainly fine so\n\n213\n00:10:21.098 --> 00:10:22.520\nyou can force that too.\n\n214\n00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.312\nThere is other things that we need to\nbe concerned with when we grab a cable.\n\n215\n00:10:26.312 --> 00:10:30.286\nWes grabbed this cable out of\nthe storage room this morning and\n\n216\n00:10:30.286 --> 00:10:34.120\nI don't think I've ever seen\nthis cable before in my life.\n\n217\n00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.577\nI just grabbed it and\nhere I am talking about it on the show.\n\n218\n00:10:36.577 --> 00:10:38.487\nI might go and plug this in my server and\n\n219\n00:10:38.487 --> 00:10:41.250\nfind that I don't get the right\nperformance out of it.\n\n220\n00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:46.196\nAnd that's because the unshielded twisted\npair comes in various grades, right?\n\n221\n00:10:46.196 --> 00:10:49.561\nSo, when you go to a cable\nstore to buy cable these days,\n\n222\n00:10:49.561 --> 00:10:52.368\nthere's three main grades that you'll see.\n\n223\n00:10:52.368 --> 00:10:57.406\nThere's Category 5, Category 5e,\nand Category 6 cabling.\n\n224\n00:10:57.406 --> 00:11:00.057\nYou'll see some people\nin market Category 7,\n\n225\n00:11:00.057 --> 00:11:04.566\nwhich is kind of this nebulous thing and\nyou might see Category 3 which is used for\n\n226\n00:11:04.566 --> 00:11:08.430\nphone lines these days,\nnot used for data networks anymore.\n\n227\n00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:12.039\nSo, you're normally gonna see Cat 5,\nCat 5e, and Cat 6.\n\n228\n00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:14.574\nThis cable in my hand could be\nany one of those, I don't know.\n\n229\n00:11:14.574 --> 00:11:18.771\nIf I go and plug this in, what do I care?\n\n230\n00:11:18.771 --> 00:11:24.890\nWell, I care because Category 5 cabling\nwas designed for 100 megabit networks.\n\n231\n00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:29.005\nIt can move 10 megabit and\n100 megabit ethernet up to 100 meters, and\n\n232\n00:11:29.005 --> 00:11:33.140\nit does it reliably and it does it fine,\nbut it wasn't designed for gigabit.\n\n233\n00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.233\nIf you try and push gigabit traffic\nover a Category 5 cable, it will work.\n\n234\n00:11:37.233 --> 00:11:39.513\nYou just won't get 100 meters.\n\n235\n00:11:39.513 --> 00:11:41.820\nYou might only get 20 meters.\n\n236\n00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.760\nAnd then, after about 20 meters,\nyour signal starts to degrade,\n\n237\n00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.360\nyou get too many package drops, you frame\ncorruptions, your CRCs are failing, and\n\n238\n00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.640\nyou don't get the performance out\nof it that you think you should.\n\n239\n00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:56.133\nBecause it's not designed to\nhandle the higher frequencies that\n\n240\n00:11:56.133 --> 00:12:00.796\ngigabit ethernet requires, and\nthat's where Cat 5e came about.\n\n241\n00:12:00.796 --> 00:12:05.121\nAt 5e improved the quality of materials\ninside of the cable, so that they\n\n242\n00:12:05.121 --> 00:12:09.656\nknow strengthen the copper wiring inside\nof it to make it where it could handle\n\n243\n00:12:09.656 --> 00:12:15.120\nthe higher frequencies and it can reliably\ncarry gigabit traffic up to a 100 meters.\n\n244\n00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.953\nSo, if we're doing a gig network,\n\n245\n00:12:16.953 --> 00:12:20.633\nyou've really gotta make sure\nyou're using Cat 5e cabling, right?\n\n246\n00:12:20.633 --> 00:12:24.676\nIf I got a server with gigabit mix in it,\nI need Cat 5e.\n\n247\n00:12:24.676 --> 00:12:27.926\nWell, the replacement\nwith Cat 5e was Cat 6.\n\n248\n00:12:27.926 --> 00:12:32.223\nCategory 6 cabling also can carry\ngigabit traffic up to 100 meters, but\n\n249\n00:12:32.223 --> 00:12:34.048\nit can even go a little further.\n\n250\n00:12:34.048 --> 00:12:35.783\nIt can do 10 gigabit traffic.\n\n251\n00:12:35.783 --> 00:12:38.194\nIt can't do10 gigabit\ntraffic up to a 100 meters.\n\n252\n00:12:38.194 --> 00:12:41.144\nIt does it, let me see,\nI think I've got a note here, 50 meters.\n\n253\n00:12:41.144 --> 00:12:43.216\nSo, it can do 10 gigabit\ntraffic up to 50 meters.\n\n254\n00:12:43.216 --> 00:12:47.780\nCat 5e and Cat 5, they can't\nreliably move 10 GB traffic at all.\n\n255\n00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.863\nYou might be able to get one meter out\nof it, but it's not anything reliable.\n\n256\n00:12:50.863 --> 00:12:56.559\nSo, in new buildings, when we run wiring,\nit's gonna be Category 6 cabling.\n\n257\n00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:57.690\nThat’s what you're gonna run.\n\n258\n00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.888\nEven though you might not have a 10\ngig network yet, you'll run Cat 6,\n\n259\n00:13:00.888 --> 00:13:02.610\ncuz it future proofs you.\n\n260\n00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.384\nBut if you've got an older building,\n\n261\n00:13:04.384 --> 00:13:08.160\ndon't be surprised if you just have\nstraight up Category 5 or even Category 3.\n\n262\n00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.804\nYou might rip some cabling\nout of the wall and\n\n263\n00:13:09.804 --> 00:13:11.638\nlook it only has got four\nwires instead of eight.\n\n264\n00:13:11.638 --> 00:13:14.660\nWell, you can't get 100\nmegabit on only 4 wires.\n\n265\n00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.040\nWell, actually you can, shoot.\n\n266\n00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:16.914\nI gotta take that back.\n\n267\n00:13:16.914 --> 00:13:19.271\nSo, you can't get a gigabit\nout of only four wires.\n\n268\n00:13:19.271 --> 00:13:21.005\nYou need eight wires for a gigabit.\n\n269\n00:13:21.005 --> 00:13:23.459\nSo, that's where you're gonna\nbottle neck yourself there and\n\n270\n00:13:23.459 --> 00:13:26.830\nyou'll have to replace that cabling\nto get to the higher speeds.\n\n271\n00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.773\nNow, if you're like me and\nyou don't know what the cable is,\n\n272\n00:13:29.773 --> 00:13:33.183\nfortunately they almost always write\nit on the outside of the cabling.\n\n273\n00:13:33.183 --> 00:13:36.278\nAnd so if I look at this,\nI'll find some writing on here.\n\n274\n00:13:36.278 --> 00:13:39.395\nLet me see if I can show this on\nactually this white cabling is probably\n\n275\n00:13:39.395 --> 00:13:40.050\neven easier.\n\n276\n00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.435\nYou see all these writing on the cable?\n\n277\n00:13:41.435 --> 00:13:46.424\nAnd if you look at that writing somewhere\nin here, let me hold it upside right,\n\n278\n00:13:46.424 --> 00:13:48.910\nso that you guys can kind of see it.\n\n279\n00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.722\nSomewhere in all of this mess,\n\n280\n00:13:50.722 --> 00:13:54.703\nyou'll find a little note like this\nright here where it says Cat 6.\n\n281\n00:13:54.703 --> 00:13:56.844\nSo, I know that this\nis Category 6 cabling.\n\n282\n00:13:56.844 --> 00:14:00.481\nBut this cable that Wes gave me,\nit's a bit older and junkier.\n\n283\n00:14:00.481 --> 00:14:03.334\nSo, let's see if I can't find that,\nit's twisted.\n\n284\n00:14:03.334 --> 00:14:07.420\nI hate when they do that,\nit's almost like a puzzle.\n\n285\n00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.034\nThere we go.\n\n286\n00:14:09.034 --> 00:14:12.803\nSays 568, it's written right here.\n\n287\n00:14:12.803 --> 00:14:15.710\nLet's see if I can twist that\nwhere we can all see it.\n\n288\n00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:20.273\n568 A Category 5, right, so\nthis is Category 5 cabling.\n\n289\n00:14:20.273 --> 00:14:24.702\nIt's got 8 wires inside of it just like\nthat Category 6 cabling, but if I try and\n\n290\n00:14:24.702 --> 00:14:27.760\npush gigabit over this,\nit may or may not work.\n\n291\n00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.155\nThis is a pretty short cable.\n\n292\n00:14:29.155 --> 00:14:31.271\nI could probably push gigabit\nover this and it would work.\n\n293\n00:14:31.271 --> 00:14:33.839\nBut if I tried to go longer distances,\nit's not gonna work out.\n\n294\n00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:35.558\nSo, when we're wiring up our server racks,\n\n295\n00:14:35.558 --> 00:14:38.018\nyou gotta make sure you have cables\nthat are the right standard.\n\n296\n00:14:38.018 --> 00:14:39.290\nThat’s really important.\n\n297\n00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:44.535\nNow, in today's modern networks,\nwe're starting to see 10 GB rolled out,\n\n298\n00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:49.800\nespecially on servers, and with 10 GB,\nyou can do it over copper.\n\n299\n00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.307\nBut the price points have equalized,\n\n300\n00:14:52.307 --> 00:14:56.943\nwhere it's actually a lot more common\nto just do fiber optic instead.\n\n301\n00:14:56.943 --> 00:14:59.733\nAnd in fact,\nif you look at the server room behind us,\n\n302\n00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:02.650\nwe have a 10 GB network here for\nour editing stations.\n\n303\n00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:06.882\nAll the editing machines that transfer the\nvideo and edit the episodes, and stuff,\n\n304\n00:15:06.882 --> 00:15:08.737\nthey use 10 GB and it's all fiber.\n\n305\n00:15:08.737 --> 00:15:11.817\nWe actually have fiber adaptors for\nthe editing work stations and\n\n306\n00:15:11.817 --> 00:15:15.737\nthey run here to the switch, and the SAN\nhas fiber, so it's all 10 GB from point to\n\n307\n00:15:15.737 --> 00:15:19.090\nfinish so they can move that\ndata much much more quickly.\n\n308\n00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:23.149\nYou can do 10 gig over\nCategory 6 copper cabling.\n\n309\n00:15:23.149 --> 00:15:24.447\nSo, you certainly can do that.\n\n310\n00:15:24.447 --> 00:15:30.041\nBut with fiber optics,\nyou can go way further with 10 gig data.\n\n311\n00:15:30.041 --> 00:15:33.957\nWhen you do fiber optics,\nit's just like copper cabling.\n\n312\n00:15:33.957 --> 00:15:36.665\nThere's a lot of different kinds\nthat we need to be aware of, and\n\n313\n00:15:36.665 --> 00:15:39.872\nso you can't just go and grab a fiber\ncable off the shelf and say, here it is,\n\n314\n00:15:39.872 --> 00:15:40.950\nI'm gonna use this one.\n\n315\n00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:45.210\nAnd, for those of you that were watching\nbefore the show started, I made a mistake,\n\n316\n00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.755\ncuz, when you look at fiber,\nit all really does kind of look the same.\n\n317\n00:15:48.755 --> 00:15:52.038\nMaybe it's a different color, or\nsomething, but fiber optic cabling usually\n\n318\n00:15:52.038 --> 00:15:54.684\nlooks something like this And\nthere's different connectors,\n\n319\n00:15:54.684 --> 00:15:57.391\nI'll talk about the different\nconnector types here in a minute.\n\n320\n00:15:57.391 --> 00:15:59.965\nBut the cabling itself\nusually looks like this,\n\n321\n00:15:59.965 --> 00:16:03.112\nwhere it's just two wires that\nare kind of stuck together.\n\n322\n00:16:03.112 --> 00:16:06.140\nLet me show that up here on camera.\n\n323\n00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.340\nTwo wires that are stuck together,\nbecause it's a pair, right?\n\n324\n00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.560\nWe have a transmit and a receive,\nand those are stuck together.\n\n325\n00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:17.450\nAnd your connector will have two points\nfor a transmit and a receive laser, right?\n\n326\n00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.000\nSo you can move that data across.\n\n327\n00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.856\nBut when I look at this fiber,\nthere's single-mode fiber and\n\n328\n00:16:23.856 --> 00:16:26.140\nthere's multi-mode fiber.\n\n329\n00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.600\nTwo different types of\nfiber optic cabling.\n\n330\n00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.540\nSingle-mode fiber is designed for\nlong-distance traffic.\n\n331\n00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.540\nWe're talking about\ntraffic over 2 kilometers.\n\n332\n00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:38.560\nYou'll see single-mode fiber run 10\nkilometers, sometimes even 20 kilometers.\n\n333\n00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.310\nLike really,\n\n334\n00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:43.640\nreally long distances, and that's what\nsingle-mode fiber is really designed for.\n\n335\n00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.165\nIn a server room, though, you're\nnormally gonna use multi-mode fiber.\n\n336\n00:16:47.165 --> 00:16:50.634\nMulti-mode fiber is designed for,\nreally, less than two kilometers.\n\n337\n00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:52.540\nReally, less than one kilometer.\n\n338\n00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:57.108\nBut you'll typically see multi-mode\nfiber one meter, three meters.\n\n339\n00:16:57.108 --> 00:17:00.559\nThose really short patch cables that\nyou run between a server and a SAN.\n\n340\n00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:03.100\nAnd so Wes gave me this cable earlier.\n\n341\n00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.831\nAnd looking at the connectors, I just\nassumed that it was multi-mode fiber,\n\n342\n00:17:06.831 --> 00:17:07.915\nand I shouldn't have done that.\n\n343\n00:17:07.915 --> 00:17:12.748\nCuz if I took the time to read on\nthe sheathing, it actually says on here,\n\n344\n00:17:12.748 --> 00:17:16.188\nsomewhere, that this is single-mode fiber.\n\n345\n00:17:16.188 --> 00:17:18.879\nActually, it doesn't\nsay single-mode fiber,\n\n346\n00:17:18.879 --> 00:17:21.420\nit's got the measurement of the core.\n\n347\n00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:26.863\nIf you look on here,\nit says it's Corning 9/125.\n\n348\n00:17:26.863 --> 00:17:28.977\nThat little note right there,\n\n349\n00:17:28.977 --> 00:17:34.360\nthat's telling you the measurement\nof the cladding and the core, right?\n\n350\n00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.510\nSo let's talk about the cladding and\nthe core.\n\n351\n00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:42.590\nThis cable is actually made up of a couple\nof components, and it's hard to see.\n\n352\n00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.200\nLet's go crazy, Wes.\n\n353\n00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.100\nIt's hard to see cuz it's intact.\n\n354\n00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.710\nI'm gonna just cut this cable open.\n\n355\n00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.320\nAnd you're not supposed to do that,\nthey don't work so\n\n356\n00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.220\nwell when you cut the cable open.\n\n357\n00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.242\nBut when you look inside\nof fiber optic cabling,\n\n358\n00:17:57.242 --> 00:18:00.420\nthere's two main pieces we care about.\n\n359\n00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.220\nIn the middle of it all,\n\n360\n00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.995\nfiber optic cabling is really\nglass in a pseudo-solid state.\n\n361\n00:18:06.995 --> 00:18:13.930\nWhich means it's, sort of, still a liquid,\nand yet, it's a solid at the same time.\n\n362\n00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.930\nSo it's glass, like in your window,\nbut you can bend really easy.\n\n363\n00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:17.801\nSo I can sit here and bend it.\n\n364\n00:18:17.801 --> 00:18:21.160\nAnd if I tried to bend my car window\nlike this, it would shatter, right?\n\n365\n00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.750\nBut this one is still kind of in that\nstate where it's able to be bent.\n\n366\n00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:29.840\nAnd if I bare this cable open, I'm gonna\ntry and open the cable and not my hand.\n\n367\n00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.690\nThat would make for\na really interesting episode.\n\n368\n00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.300\nWe'd have to up the age rating on it.\n\n369\n00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.370\nThis episode's rated PG-13 for\nexcessive blood.\n\n370\n00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:41.650\nBut if we take a look inside,\nwhat we'll find is that glass core.\n\n371\n00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:45.350\nAnd wrapped around the glass core\nis what's called the cladding.\n\n372\n00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:50.170\nAnd the cladding is like a reflective\nmaterial that the light beams,\n\n373\n00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.830\nyou're basically shooting\na laser down the fiber.\n\n374\n00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.370\nAnd the laser is gonna pass\nright through the glass.\n\n375\n00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:59.970\nThat's the whole point of it,\nis to pass through the glass.\n\n376\n00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:00.647\nThere we go.\n\n377\n00:19:00.647 --> 00:19:04.370\nAnd it's gonna reflect\noff of that cladding.\n\n378\n00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:08.520\nNow, I'm opening this cable and\nit's a little hard to see here, but it's.\n\n379\n00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:13.270\nYou're seeing, really, a lot of different\nthings coming out of this cabling.\n\n380\n00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:14.800\nThere's a bunch of yellow fibers.\n\n381\n00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.220\nSince there's only one cable\ninside of here, this white cable,\n\n382\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.380\nthat's the one we care about.\n\n383\n00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.620\nSince it's only one cable,\nit'd be really easy to tug on it,\n\n384\n00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.800\nand actually have it slip right out of\nthe sheathing and displace the cable,\n\n385\n00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.760\nor rip the connector out at the other end.\n\n386\n00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.420\nSo they put these fibers in here just\nto help lock the cable in place.\n\n387\n00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:39.247\nSo if I tug on this white cable here,\nwhat's actually the fiber.\n\n388\n00:19:39.247 --> 00:19:41.543\nIf I tug on it,\nit might come out a little bit, but\n\n389\n00:19:41.543 --> 00:19:43.560\nit's not gonna come out very much.\n\n390\n00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.420\nIf this fiber wasn't here,\nI could pull on this, and\n\n391\n00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.690\nit would just slide right out of\nthe sheathing, and that would be it.\n\n392\n00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.370\nSo that's what all this fiber is,\nit's just kinda locking that in place.\n\n393\n00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.930\nIt doesn't actually mess with the data.\n\n394\n00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.470\nBut this cable right here,\nwhat I'm looking at,\n\n395\n00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:58.910\nthis white part, that's the cladding.\n\n396\n00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.040\nAnd inside of it, really, really small, so\n\n397\n00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.550\nwe're not gonna be able to see\nit on camera, is a thin, tiny,\n\n398\n00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.640\nlittle strand of glass,\nabout the size of a human hair, right?\n\n399\n00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.719\nSo we're talking about really,\nreally small inside of that.\n\n400\n00:20:13.719 --> 00:20:16.700\nThere's no real way that I\ncan show that on camera.\n\n401\n00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.110\nSo instead,\nlet me show you guys a diagram.\n\n402\n00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:24.190\nAnd diagrams aren't as exciting as\nthe real thing, but here we go.\n\n403\n00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.635\nSo inside of that that cable,\nthis is kinda what it looks like.\n\n404\n00:20:26.635 --> 00:20:29.055\nYou've got the buffer and the coating,\n\n405\n00:20:29.055 --> 00:20:31.695\nthat's all just kind of\nthe outside wrapping of the cable.\n\n406\n00:20:31.695 --> 00:20:34.905\nAnd then inside there's the cladding,\nthat's that reflective material.\n\n407\n00:20:34.905 --> 00:20:37.665\nAnd inside that is the glass\ncore that makes up the cable.\n\n408\n00:20:37.665 --> 00:20:42.935\nSo this is what's inside that little\nwhite wire that we saw there.\n\n409\n00:20:42.935 --> 00:20:46.800\nAnd when I see a measurement like 9/125,\n\n410\n00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.510\nthat's the measurement of the core and\nthe cladding in microns.\n\n411\n00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:55.495\nSo the core is only 9 microns in diameter.\n\n412\n00:20:55.495 --> 00:21:01.720\nAnd then the cladding is\n125 microns in diameter.\n\n413\n00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.290\nNow, you guys saw the cable right there.\n\n414\n00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:08.270\nIt's really, really small, and\nwe were looking at the big part.\n\n415\n00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:11.890\nSo imagine how small\nthe 9-micron part would be.\n\n416\n00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.970\nIt's less than a tenth of\nthe size of the cladding.\n\n417\n00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.250\nIt's really, really small.\n\n418\n00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.363\nBut we're shooting a laser beam down it,\nso it doesn't need to be very big.\n\n419\n00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:22.820\nAnd the smaller it is,\nthe more flexible it is.\n\n420\n00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.410\nSo that's what makes it easier for\nthem to run fiber, and run it this way.\n\n421\n00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:30.640\nSingle-mode fiber is small,\n9/125, that's pretty common.\n\n422\n00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.490\nMulti-mode fiber is bigger.\n\n423\n00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.641\nIt's bigger because it's moving\ndata a shorter distance, and so\n\n424\n00:21:36.641 --> 00:21:39.467\nit can have a little more room\nto bounce around in that wire.\n\n425\n00:21:39.467 --> 00:21:42.545\nAnd we can move more data sometimes, also.\n\n426\n00:21:42.545 --> 00:21:46.750\nSo with multi-mode fiber you'll\nnormally see a core size\n\n427\n00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.708\nthat's much bigger, like 62, 62.5?\n\n428\n00:21:49.708 --> 00:21:50.821\n&gt;&gt; 62.5 and 50.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Wes.\n\n429\n00:21:50.821 --> 00:21:55.785\nSo 50 and 62.5,\ntwo different core sizes, right?\n\n430\n00:21:55.785 --> 00:21:59.641\nDepending on the cable you buy,\nyou might get 50 or you might get 62.5.\n\n431\n00:21:59.641 --> 00:22:03.082\nAnd then the cladding, well,\nthe cladding is almost always 125.\n\n432\n00:22:03.082 --> 00:22:05.440\nWes, have you seen cabling with\na cladding of a different size?\n\n433\n00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.105\n&gt;&gt; It seems to be the standard that\nit's all 125, just like you said, yeah.\n\n434\n00:22:08.105 --> 00:22:10.160\n&gt;&gt; Single-mode or multi mode,\nthat's what it's gonna be.\n\n435\n00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.150\nBut the core, this is what matters.\n\n436\n00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:16.271\nAnd I know what you're thinking,\ndo I get 50 or do I get 62.5?\n\n437\n00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:17.836\nWell, 62.5 is the most common.\n\n438\n00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:20.070\nSo that's what you're\nnormally going to get.\n\n439\n00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.608\nBut if you're ever unsure\nof which one to get,\n\n440\n00:22:22.608 --> 00:22:25.870\ncheck the device that\nyou're plugging it in into.\n\n441\n00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.170\nIn that vendor documentation for\n\n442\n00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:30.360\nthe device you're plugging into,\nthey'll tell you which one they prefer.\n\n443\n00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.070\nAnd oftentimes they'll accept both,\nso it won't matter.\n\n444\n00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.690\nWhen you plug fiber optics into a device,\n\n445\n00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.990\nit's not like you're actually\ninserting the fiber cable.\n\n446\n00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:40.350\nIt's going to have connectors on it.\n\n447\n00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.620\nAnd these different connector types\nare terminating that fiber to and\n\n448\n00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.291\nend that your device is expecting.\n\n449\n00:22:45.291 --> 00:22:47.730\nAnd it's just expecting a laser\nbeam to shoot right through it.\n\n450\n00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.144\nSo it's not really expecting\na huge amount of contact.\n\n451\n00:22:50.144 --> 00:22:52.956\nWith copper you've got a little bent wire,\n\n452\n00:22:52.956 --> 00:22:56.607\nand then you've got the copper\nthat you're inserting.\n\n453\n00:22:56.607 --> 00:23:00.620\nThe bent wire actually bends and\ncreates contact, like that, right?\n\n454\n00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:01.790\nSo you need a surface.\n\n455\n00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:04.240\nAnd that's why,\nwhen we look at this RJ45 ends,\n\n456\n00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.970\nif you look at it, you can actually see,\nreally, they're really big.\n\n457\n00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.182\nAll the little copper plates\nthat run across the front here.\n\n458\n00:23:11.182 --> 00:23:14.381\nThey have to be big, so\nthat when you plug in,\n\n459\n00:23:14.381 --> 00:23:18.870\nthe little bent wires have\nsomething to contact with, right?\n\n460\n00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.420\nThey're gonna touch all those\nlittle copper pads right there.\n\n461\n00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.700\nSo you need room,\nthat's why these connectors are big.\n\n462\n00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.870\nBut fiber optics, it's a laser beam.\n\n463\n00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:28.470\nIt's really small, so\nyou don't need all that.\n\n464\n00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.480\nAnd so what you end up with are connectors\nlike these, that are focused more on just\n\n465\n00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.800\nholding the cable in than they\nare actually creating contact.\n\n466\n00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.250\n&gt;&gt; You know, Don, one of the things you've\nshowed us with our Ethernet cables there,\n\n467\n00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:43.450\nand the copper cables, is that they look\nto be the same connector on both sides.\n\n468\n00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.080\nI'm judging by that single-mode\nfiber cable that you're showing and\n\n469\n00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.300\nmassacring on camera here.\n\n470\n00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It does look like that it's got\n\n471\n00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.258\na couple of different connectors,\none different connector on each side.\n\n472\n00:23:52.258 --> 00:23:54.072\nCan you tell us a little\nbit more about those?\n\n473\n00:23:54.072 --> 00:23:57.887\nSo, there are numerous\ndifferent connectors for fiber.\n\n474\n00:23:57.887 --> 00:24:00.530\nYou can have where it's the same\nconnector on each side.\n\n475\n00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.577\nIn fact, I've got one back here.\n\n476\n00:24:02.577 --> 00:24:04.798\nI should probably start it out like this,\n\n477\n00:24:04.798 --> 00:24:07.660\nit's more common to have it\nbe the same on both sides.\n\n478\n00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.900\nIt's less common to have a cable like what\nI was showing there where it's different.\n\n479\n00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.960\nThis is a brand new cable, never used.\n\n480\n00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.830\nI'll try not to destroy\nthis one on the show.\n\n481\n00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:20.670\nBut here's a brand new cable, and\nit is an LC connector on both sides.\n\n482\n00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:23.080\nThe same connector on both sides,\nthat's what you expect to see.\n\n483\n00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:28.240\nNow, when I look at this, it is\na little bit, a little bit different.\n\n484\n00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.410\nLet me show you one thing we have to be\nconcerned with when we deal with fiber.\n\n485\n00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:33.900\nI mentioned how fiber uses pairs.\n\n486\n00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.299\nSo, you've got a transmit and a receive.\n\n487\n00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:42.500\nWell, the transmit on side needs to\nmap to the receive on the other.\n\n488\n00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.659\nThis cable coming right out of the box,\nif I look at it,\n\n489\n00:24:45.659 --> 00:24:47.996\nsee how the connectors are the same, but\n\n490\n00:24:47.996 --> 00:24:51.880\nthere's a little yellow mark and\na white mark on two of the cables.\n\n491\n00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:56.258\nWhat those little marks are doing is\nhelping me track which one is mapped to\n\n492\n00:24:56.258 --> 00:24:57.280\nwhich.\n\n493\n00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.300\nOn this one, for me is the right side,\n\n494\n00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:07.230\nthe right side cable is yellow, on this\nconnector, the left side cable is yellow.\n\n495\n00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:11.390\nSo, on these connectors, the transmit\non one side would map to the receive on\n\n496\n00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.952\nthe other or\nif this is the receive it would map.\n\n497\n00:25:13.952 --> 00:25:16.460\nThey're different,\nthat's what is important.\n\n498\n00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:20.960\nSo, on this one I know that it's set up\nfor the transmit received to be correct.\n\n499\n00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.700\nBut you gotta be really careful,\n\n500\n00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:27.810\nbecause these are gonna plug\ninto usually SFP adapters.\n\n501\n00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:31.180\nWhen you buy a server that has fiber\noptic connections inside of it,\n\n502\n00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.040\nit typically has an adapter that then\ntakes these little insert modules,\n\n503\n00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.980\nthe small form factor ports.\n\n504\n00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.270\nAnd they allow us to plug in\nvarious fiber cabling, and\n\n505\n00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.920\nwe've got a couple of them\nlaying over here I'll show you.\n\n506\n00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:47.775\nThink about SFPs,\nthere's a number of people that make them.\n\n507\n00:25:47.775 --> 00:25:51.760\nHP, Cisco, Dell,\na bunch of people make them.\n\n508\n00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.130\nMost of them come from the same\nfactories over in China,\n\n509\n00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.800\nso the vendor name doesn't really matter.\n\n510\n00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.160\nSome vendors are really specific though,\nlike HP and HP switches will only allow\n\n511\n00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.450\nyou to use HP authorized SFPs,\nthey wont let you use generic ones.\n\n512\n00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.870\nVersus Cisco switches where they let you\nuse generic just fine so, you may or\n\n513\n00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.940\nmay not be able to buy ones\nfrom different vendors.\n\n514\n00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.588\nBut when you buy the SFPs,\nthey might all look the same at first, but\n\n515\n00:26:14.588 --> 00:26:16.194\nthere are some differences.\n\n516\n00:26:16.194 --> 00:26:20.620\nSo, let me show you what these LFC\nconnectors would actually be plugged into.\n\n517\n00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.840\nThese are SFPs right here, and\n\n518\n00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.400\nwhen we look at them real, just at a quick\nglance, they all kind of look the same.\n\n519\n00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:34.350\nWhat they do is on the back side they've\ngot little exposed copper plates.\n\n520\n00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:39.680\nAnd these copper plates are very\nsimilar to what we saw in a Cat5 cable.\n\n521\n00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.190\nSo, the little copper pads are gonna\ncontact something inside of a device.\n\n522\n00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.170\nAnd it then runs through\na little bit of circuitry\n\n523\n00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:50.500\nthat converts that electrical\nsignal into what we want.\n\n524\n00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:54.400\nNow, you can get SFPs that\nhave an RJ45 jack on them.\n\n525\n00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:59.290\nAnd once you do that, now you can plug in\na copper cabling and you've got 10 GB or\n\n526\n00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:04.070\n1 GB copper cabling run of an SFP,\nbut we're normally gonna go fiber.\n\n527\n00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:08.260\nAnd for fiber, we're normally gonna\nsee LC connectors like these.\n\n528\n00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:12.890\nSo, that cable that I was showing you\njust a moment ago, I can take it.\n\n529\n00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:16.500\nWhen you get a brand new cable like this\none, it's got little protectors on it.\n\n530\n00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:22.000\nIf the fiber gets dirty, it's a laser,\nyou block the light you block the signal.\n\n531\n00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.627\nSo, they put these little caps on the end,\nI'm just gonna take those off,\n\n532\n00:27:25.627 --> 00:27:27.770\nwhich is going to expose\nthe little lasers.\n\n533\n00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.200\nWhich again, we can't see on camera,\nthey're so small.\n\n534\n00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.125\nBut it's gonna expose those little ends,\nand\n\n535\n00:27:33.125 --> 00:27:37.260\nI can take that and pop it right\ninto this adapter, and plug it in.\n\n536\n00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.630\nSo, pretty straightforward.\n\n537\n00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:46.740\nAlthough what I need to watch out for is,\nif you take a real close look at this SFP,\n\n538\n00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:52.200\nwhat you're gonna notice is up here\ntowards the top, see these little arrows?\n\n539\n00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:57.051\nI've got one arrow that is\npointing towards the cable, and\n\n540\n00:27:57.051 --> 00:28:00.359\none that is pointing towards the laser.\n\n541\n00:28:00.359 --> 00:28:02.990\nThe one that's pointing towards the cable,\nthat's my transmitter.\n\n542\n00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.901\nAnd the one pointing\ntowards the transmitter,\n\n543\n00:28:05.901 --> 00:28:09.185\n[INAUDIBLE] guess I kinda screwed that up,\ndidn't I.\n\n544\n00:28:09.185 --> 00:28:13.201\nAnyhow, this one's [LAUGH] this one's\nsending this one s receiving, right?\n\n545\n00:28:13.201 --> 00:28:15.970\nThe arrows are showing the direction,\nso that I know.\n\n546\n00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:17.320\nSo now,\nwhen I look at this I'm like, okay,\n\n547\n00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:22.130\nI plug in the yellow here,\nthe yellow is where I'm transmitting.\n\n548\n00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:26.100\nSo, on the other side, the yellow needs\nto be plugged into the receiving, so\n\n549\n00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.770\nI need to get that right.\n\n550\n00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:31.026\nWhere it gets tricky,\nis not every SFP is in the same order, and\n\n551\n00:28:31.026 --> 00:28:33.710\nthey don't even all have arrows,\nlike this.\n\n552\n00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.630\nSo when you look at another SFP, for\n\n553\n00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.870\nexample, if I take this other one here,\nthis is a generic one.\n\n554\n00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:43.705\nThe one I was holding a moment ago was an\nofficial HP one, this one's just generic.\n\n555\n00:28:43.705 --> 00:28:46.230\nNow when I look at this generic one,\n\n556\n00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:49.775\nI'm not seeing any arrows\njumping out at me here.\n\n557\n00:28:49.775 --> 00:28:52.641\nI'm gonna spin it around, this one\nalso has a little protector in it,\n\n558\n00:28:52.641 --> 00:28:54.310\nI'm just gonna pop that out and see.\n\n559\n00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.790\nThere's the arrows,\nlet me see if I can get that on camera.\n\n560\n00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:01.060\nIf the light catches it just right,\nyou can see the arrows beneath the hole.\n\n561\n00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:06.450\nSo, the arrows are showing me that the one\nhere on the left that's coming in,\n\n562\n00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:10.460\nthat's my receive, and\nthis one is going out, that's my transmit.\n\n563\n00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:15.885\nAnd so, when I plug in my cabling,\nwell, are they in the right order?\n\n564\n00:29:15.885 --> 00:29:17.700\nThey might not be in the right order.\n\n565\n00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:18.833\nSo when I plug this in,\n\n566\n00:29:18.833 --> 00:29:22.840\nthese arrows could be in a different order\nthan the connector on the other side.\n\n567\n00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:27.674\nSo, when you get fiber optic cabling\nlike this, it's kinda hard to tell,\n\n568\n00:29:27.674 --> 00:29:32.200\nbut most of them are designed\nwhere you can take the end apart.\n\n569\n00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.220\nSee there's these little\npressure clips on the side,\n\n570\n00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.050\nI don't know if I can do it with my hands.\n\n571\n00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:40.260\nNormally, I do it with a screwdriver,\nbut you can pop that clip open.\n\n572\n00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.810\nI know, I'll use a razor blade,\ncuz that'll be safe.\n\n573\n00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:46.730\nThis isn't the safety episode,\nwe'll save that for later, but\n\n574\n00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.560\nI'm gonna use a razor blade to\njust pop that open, there we go.\n\n575\n00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:54.240\nAnd so, I pop open one of the little\npressure wings, and then I'll do the same\n\n576\n00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:58.130\nthing on the other side,\nI'll pop open that wing, there we go.\n\n577\n00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:03.958\nAnd when you pop those open, that kind\nof releases pressure on the connector,\n\n578\n00:30:03.958 --> 00:30:07.730\nand at that point you\ncan separate the ends.\n\n579\n00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:09.030\nAnd once they're separated,\n\n580\n00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:13.240\nyou can flip them around to get them\nin the order that you need them to be.\n\n581\n00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:18.950\nSo, if these are in the wrong order, I\ncan just take them out, flip them around,\n\n582\n00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:20.370\nand put it all back together again.\n\n583\n00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:25.134\nWith LC connectors like these,\nwhich are the most common, these are what\n\n584\n00:30:25.134 --> 00:30:28.460\nyou're gonna put into modern data centers,\nyou may have to do that.\n\n585\n00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.245\nI know we've had to do it, any time\nyou run between multiple vendors, or\n\n586\n00:30:31.245 --> 00:30:34.370\neven just multiple vendors of SFPs, a lot\nof times you'll have to switch those.\n\n587\n00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:41.722\nThe other thing to worry about with\nSFPs is that there's single mode SFPs,\n\n588\n00:30:41.722 --> 00:30:46.480\nthere's multi mode SFPs and\nthere are multiple speeds.\n\n589\n00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.791\n10 GB, you've got 1 GB,\nyou've even got 100 MB SFPs out there for\n\n590\n00:30:50.791 --> 00:30:52.980\nsome of the older equipment.\n\n591\n00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.669\nSo, when you get these,\nbe careful with that,\n\n592\n00:30:55.669 --> 00:31:00.260\nif you look like this one is labeled 10g\ntech which I think might be the company.\n\n593\n00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:03.440\nSo, is it actually 10 GB or\nis that just the name of the company?\n\n594\n00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.050\nThat be funny if it wasn't.\n\n595\n00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.740\nThese other ones are got two HPs, and\n\n596\n00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:13.520\nif you look their part numbers up,\nthis blue one is a GB SFP.\n\n597\n00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:18.250\nThis black one is a 10 GB SFP,\nthey look almost identical.\n\n598\n00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.845\nWhen you look at them,\nthey really don't look that different, but\n\n599\n00:31:21.845 --> 00:31:24.330\none is ten times faster than the other.\n\n600\n00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:25.902\nSo, if I'm running a 10 GB connection,\n\n601\n00:31:25.902 --> 00:31:27.878\nI need to make sure I've got\nthe correct one for that.\n\n602\n00:31:27.878 --> 00:31:31.148\nSo, that's all the stuff that we have to\nbe concern about when running fiber into\n\n603\n00:31:31.148 --> 00:31:33.140\na server and getting that connected.\n\n604\n00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.531\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, with SC connector or\n\n605\n00:31:34.531 --> 00:31:37.545\nthe subscriber connectors\nare called versus the LC connector.\n\n606\n00:31:37.545 --> 00:31:39.575\nI know we've had this conversation before.\n\n607\n00:31:39.575 --> 00:31:42.755\nWhat is the benefit when it\ncomes to the cable versus\n\n608\n00:31:42.755 --> 00:31:44.465\nthe ports on your switch to an LC?\n\n609\n00:31:44.465 --> 00:31:45.199\nWhat's the benefit of an LC connector?\n\n610\n00:31:45.199 --> 00:31:45.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so,\n\n611\n00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:49.895\nthere's actually three different types\nof connectors that you might see.\n\n612\n00:31:49.895 --> 00:31:54.452\nAnd as far as benefits,\nthey all provide the same speed.\n\n613\n00:31:54.452 --> 00:31:57.013\nThey all provide the same bandwidth and\nfunctionality.\n\n614\n00:31:57.013 --> 00:31:59.478\nSo we don't normally\ncare about the connector,\n\n615\n00:31:59.478 --> 00:32:01.770\nwe just want to get the one that fits.\n\n616\n00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.400\nBut they have changed over the years and\nthere's reasons for that.\n\n617\n00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.940\nThe original connectors,\n\n618\n00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.110\nthe ones we saw the most,\nwere what were called ST connectors.\n\n619\n00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.590\nAnd I don't have any of\nthose laying around so\n\n620\n00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:13.770\nI've got a picture here on my laptop\nof what an ST connector looks like.\n\n621\n00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:15.670\nThis is what ST looked like.\n\n622\n00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:18.140\nThey were basically little\nround connectors, and\n\n623\n00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.190\nthey weren't stuck together,\nthey were independent.\n\n624\n00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:23.040\nSo you could flip transmit and\nreceive really easily with these and\n\n625\n00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.100\nthey just snapped on\nlike a BNC cable would.\n\n626\n00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:30.540\nYou still see these used in a lot\nof fiber termination closets.\n\n627\n00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:34.670\nSo the network guys that run them through\nthe walls, and run them to an MDF or\n\n628\n00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:38.590\nSDF somewhere, when they run those\nthey'll typically use these connectors\n\n629\n00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:41.560\nbecause it's so\neasy to flip transmit and receive.\n\n630\n00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.420\nReally easy to maintain these and\nso that's where they get used.\n\n631\n00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.170\nThey're not so good on servers, where\nit's very easy to confuse the two and\n\n632\n00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:48.700\nmess those up.\n\n633\n00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.550\nAnd they take a lot of room,\nthe connectors they stick out.\n\n634\n00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:56.440\nThe female side of this connector\nprotrudes from the card and\n\n635\n00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.320\nthat's always a problem, too.\n\n636\n00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.670\nIt makes it harder to replace the card and\nall that.\n\n637\n00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:02.410\nSo, they're not the most\nconvenient connectors.\n\n638\n00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:05.090\nAnd so\nthat's where the SC connector came from,\n\n639\n00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:07.830\nthat's this other one that I showed\non camera a little bit earlier.\n\n640\n00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:13.350\nThis is the SC connector, and with\nthe SC there two big square connectors,\n\n641\n00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:16.700\nI've gotta protector in one of them,\ntwo square connectors there.\n\n642\n00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.860\nAnd they're in a little sheathing\nhere that is, again, not so\n\n643\n00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:22.916\nhard to separate out and\nswap transmitted receiver if you need to.\n\n644\n00:33:22.916 --> 00:33:28.500\nAnd these were really the standard\nconnector throughout the 1990s.\n\n645\n00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.990\nIf you were doing a data center in\nthe 1990s, and even in the early 2000s,\n\n646\n00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:34.380\nyou were running these connectors.\n\n647\n00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.760\nOn these, the female side\nis recessed into the cards.\n\n648\n00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.030\nThese pop right into the card,\nand that's that.\n\n649\n00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:44.288\nThese would still be in use today,\nif it weren't for the size.\n\n650\n00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:45.750\nThey're just big.\n\n651\n00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.406\nAnd when you look at an SFP,\n\n652\n00:33:47.406 --> 00:33:52.378\nthey tried to get the size of fiber down\nto about the size of an RJ45 jack, right?\n\n653\n00:33:52.378 --> 00:33:53.579\nOf a regular network cable, right.\n\n654\n00:33:53.579 --> 00:33:57.800\nAnd this is significantly bigger, so\nthat's not gonna work out, right?\n\n655\n00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:02.780\nSo what they did is they came up with a\nnew connector that's effectively the same.\n\n656\n00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.400\nI still have the two square posts\ninside of it, they're just smaller.\n\n657\n00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.410\nThe fiber cable is really small anyway,\nyou didn't need all this bulk around it.\n\n658\n00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:13.540\nSo they just shrunk it down,\nfunctionality wise, they're the same.\n\n659\n00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:16.880\nAnd that's why you can get\nadapter cables like this one\n\n660\n00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.050\nwhere I've got LC on one side and\nST on the other,\n\n661\n00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:24.760\nI mean SC on the other, it doesn't matter\ncuz the fiber is fiber on the inside.\n\n662\n00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.710\nI'm just getting the one that fits.\n\n663\n00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:28.390\nSo this is what we used back in\nthe day when we were migrating.\n\n664\n00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:30.520\nWhen you had some switches\nwith the old connector and\n\n665\n00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.880\nother switches with the new\nconnector you'd run these.\n\n666\n00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.870\nAnd it would connect it to and off you\nwent, that was it, it was that easy.\n\n667\n00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:40.885\nOn newer equipment like what you\nsee behind me, we just get these.\n\n668\n00:34:40.885 --> 00:34:44.040\nLC on both sides and\nyou run everything LC.\n\n669\n00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:48.410\nWe even have LC in our fiber closet, for\nthe fiber for the building, it's all LC.\n\n670\n00:34:48.410 --> 00:34:52.350\nI don't think we have any other connectors\nin production in the building anywhere\n\n671\n00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:54.480\nother than what's laying\non this desk right here.\n\n672\n00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.320\nSo, those are some of\nthe different connectors and\n\n673\n00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.650\nas far as advantages and stuff,\n\n674\n00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:01.850\nthere's not really an advantage on one\nconnector over another other than size.\n\n675\n00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.820\nAll right Wes, I've got a few more\nthings that I need to talk about but\n\n676\n00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.750\nI know that we're short on time.\n\n677\n00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:10.250\nSo I need to talk a little bit\nmore about some of the other\n\n678\n00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:11.090\nconnectors that are out there.\n\n679\n00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.180\nAnd we need to talk about\ncable management, or\n\n680\n00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.700\nhow we run those cables\nthrough the server rack.\n\n681\n00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:18.730\nSo that's all gonna come up here,\nin I guess in a part two.\n\n682\n00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:19.510\nWhat do you think Wes?\n\n683\n00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:22.118\n&gt;&gt; Hey that sounds good,\nin fact I can't wait to see more goodies.\n\n684\n00:35:22.118 --> 00:35:24.970\nMan hey, when you've got all\nthe goodies laid in front of the table,\n\n685\n00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:26.820\nI'm gonna be excited about that one, Don.\n\n686\n00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.360\nI'll tell you what we'll do, exactly that.\n\n687\n00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.710\nBut before we do, do you wanna close out\nanything on copper media and fiber or\n\n688\n00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.570\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nsave that for the part two?\n\n689\n00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:35.310\n&gt;&gt; Let's save it for\nthe next one cuz I need to talk about,\n\n690\n00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:38.030\nwe got a question in the chat\nroom I need to talk about anyway,\n\n691\n00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.840\nabout the fiber that's run through walls,\nthrough structures.\n\n692\n00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.310\nThat's different than the fiber\nI'm showing you here, and so\n\n693\n00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:45.890\nwe need to address that a little bit and\njust kinda tidy that up.\n\n694\n00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:48.680\nSo just know, there is more to come.\n\n695\n00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:49.220\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don.\n\n696\n00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.640\nWell as always, we appreciate you being in\nthe studio with us and we appreciate you,\n\n697\n00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:53.980\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n698\n00:35:53.980 -->

00:00:12.110\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.760\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode here\nat ITPRO.TV, I'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n5\n00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.710\nAnd in today's episode, we're\ncontinuing along in our Server+ track.\n\n6\n00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.520\nWe're actually coming back with\na part two on cable management.\n\n7\n00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.440\nJoining us in the studios today\nis none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.460\nDon, how are you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.180\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.700\nReady to continue our cable adventure,\nwhere we have been talking about copper\n\n11\n00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.140\ncabling and fiber cabling that we use\nin servers and typical data centers.\n\n12\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.210\nI talked about a lot of\nstuff in the last episode.\n\n13\n00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.050\nAnd I just wanted to continue on with a\nfew more things we need to be aware of out\n\n14\n00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.020\nthere in the real world,\nas well as on the exam.\n\n15\n00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.350\nSo let's just pick right\nback up where we left off.\n\n16\n00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.170\nI think I ended,\nwe were still talking about fiber.\n\n17\n00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.530\nSo let me continue on with fiber a bit\nbefore we move into cable management.\n\n18\n00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.108\nNow, as I waved about\nthe cables in the last episode,\n\n19\n00:00:54.108 --> 00:00:57.170\nI think the two main cables that I was\nshowing were these two guys right here.\n\n20\n00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.150\nI talked about the different\nconnectors and the speeds and all that.\n\n21\n00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.980\nAnd one thing I never really mentioned\nwere the colors of the cable.\n\n22\n00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.260\nI don't normally think about it too much,\nbut it is worth mentioning.\n\n23\n00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.060\nYou might have noticed that this cable\nis light blue and this cable is yellow.\n\n24\n00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.540\nAnd maybe you didn't care,\nright, most people don't.\n\n25\n00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.760\nWhen you have a copper cable,\nlike Cat 5 or Cat 6,\n\n26\n00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.240\nwhatever, the color doesn't matter.\n\n27\n00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.610\nYou just buy the color\nthat looks prettiest or\n\n28\n00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.780\nwhichever color is the cheapest.\n\n29\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.550\nThat's it, right, we don't care.\n\n30\n00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.920\nBut with fiber cabling,\nthe color actually does matter.\n\n31\n00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.540\nThe coloring is tied to\nwhich standard the cable is.\n\n32\n00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.840\nNow, you can buy fiber cabling that's\nnot colored to standard if you want.\n\n33\n00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.920\nBut typically it is going\nto be colored to standard.\n\n34\n00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.472\nAnd that's important because you don't\nwanna just assume that it's a certain\n\n35\n00:01:42.472 --> 00:01:43.010\nstandard.\n\n36\n00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.190\nAnd you can read on\nthe sheathing what it is.\n\n37\n00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.780\nThey write it on there just like\nthe Cat 6 cabling and whatever.\n\n38\n00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.242\nSo this yellow cabling is some\nof the older, standard cable.\n\n39\n00:01:53.242 --> 00:01:56.690\nThis cable's actually pretty old, so\nthis is isn't what we'd normally use.\n\n40\n00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.160\nBut in a typical data center these days,\n\n41\n00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.860\nyou're gonna be using light\nblue cabling like this.\n\n42\n00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.300\nLight blue means OM3.\n\n43\n00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.890\nOM3 is fiber optic cable capable of\ncarrying 10 gigabits of traffic.\n\n44\n00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.310\nNow, on a 10 gig network, you're gonna\nwant a cable capable of carrying 10 gigs.\n\n45\n00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.640\nAnd so OM3 is what we need.\n\n46\n00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.510\nIf you're doing 40 gig, well,\nOM3 can actually carry that, too.\n\n47\n00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.110\nSo it's got a little bit of\nfuture-proofing in it, and\n\n48\n00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.380\nthis is what we're going to run.\n\n49\n00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.270\nThis is what you'll see in\nthe racks behind us here.\n\n50\n00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.990\nIt's what we run here in our building.\n\n51\n00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.280\nNow, if you have the older cable,\nyou're not out of luck.\n\n52\n00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.560\nYou may just not be able to\npush some of the higher speeds.\n\n53\n00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.800\nYou may be able to,\nyou can always try it out.\n\n54\n00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.600\nBut they measure a lot of this very\nspecifically cuz we're talking about laser\n\n55\n00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.210\nbeams, and they need a high level\nof accuracy over this stuff.\n\n56\n00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.790\nSo that's an important concern\nwhen you deal with a cable, and\n\n57\n00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.980\nthe color actually does matter.\n\n58\n00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.670\nI don't particularly like light blue, but\nthat's just the color that we've got.\n\n59\n00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.280\nThe other thing that I want to mention is\nthat all of the cabling that I showed in\n\n60\n00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.280\nthe last episode was cabling that\nwe'd use in our server racks.\n\n61\n00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.640\nThat we, as system admins,\nwould actually run between our servers and\n\n62\n00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.700\nour switches, the things that we'd go\nout and buy patch cables for and so on.\n\n63\n00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.770\nThis is not what you\nwould run in your wall.\n\n64\n00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.480\nThis is not infrastructure cabling, right.\n\n65\n00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.082\nInfrastructure cabling is different.\n\n66\n00:03:11.082 --> 00:03:14.740\nIt's different mainly because\nit's hard to run, right.\n\n67\n00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.730\nSo it's hard to run cable through a wall.\n\n68\n00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.980\nSo when you buy cabling,\nfiber cabling to run through a wall,\n\n69\n00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.800\nit's not typically just two\nwires like this, right.\n\n70\n00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.570\nWhen we talk about fiber patch cables,\nthere's a transmit and a receive.\n\n71\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.420\nIt's a pair of fiber optic connections.\n\n72\n00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.860\nBut when you run cabling in the wall,\nyou're gonna go out and you're gonna buy\n\n73\n00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.070\na giant spool of cabling, which would\nnormally be pretty hard to lift.\n\n74\n00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.830\nBut this one's fairly used up.\n\n75\n00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.370\nThis is an actual cable that we use to run\n\n76\n00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.460\nfiber over to the other\nside of our building.\n\n77\n00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.860\nJust a few weeks ago.\n\n78\n00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.570\nSo you'll buy a spool of fiber\noptic cabling like this.\n\n79\n00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.570\nAnd inside of the spool,\nnotice this spool is light blue.\n\n80\n00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.910\nSo just like the patch cable this\nis light blue because this is OM3,\n\n81\n00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.630\nsame type of fiber.\n\n82\n00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.390\nAnd the cabling, itself,\nis not two wires stuck together.\n\n83\n00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.179\nLet me get this where we can\nzoom in on it a bit and see.\n\n84\n00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.740\nWhen I held up that patch cable over here,\nif you look at it,\n\n85\n00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.980\nyou can actually see where\nit's two wires stuck together.\n\n86\n00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.250\nI shouldn't call them wires cuz they're\nfiber strands, right, strands of fiber.\n\n87\n00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.450\nSo there's two strands stuck together.\n\n88\n00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.360\nWhen I look at this cable from the spool,\nit looks more like a Cat 5 cable or\n\n89\n00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.350\nsomething, doesn't it?\n\n90\n00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.520\nIt's one big cable.\n\n91\n00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.550\nWell, that's because when you\nrun cabling through the wall,\n\n92\n00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.980\nyou don't wanna have to go and\nrun more later on.\n\n93\n00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.350\nAnd so, typically, the infrastructure\ncabling has more than two strands in it.\n\n94\n00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.360\nYou'll normally find it with six or\neight, or even more.\n\n95\n00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.630\nThey even have 12 strand,\n24 strand, and even bigger, so\n\n96\n00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.740\nyou're running a ton of strands.\n\n97\n00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.660\nAnd then you can pull those pairs out and\nuse them for all sorts of things.\n\n98\n00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.490\nSo when I look at this cabling,\nit's hard to see here, but\n\n99\n00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.350\nI've got a cable that is cut open.\n\n100\n00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.570\nWhen you cut open the cabling, the first\nthing you're gonna see is that it's\n\n101\n00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.070\ngot a ton of this stuff in there because\nnow we're not talking about just one wire,\n\n102\n00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.345\nwe're talking about several, right.\n\n103\n00:05:14.345 --> 00:05:17.430\nI believe this one has\neight strands inside of it.\n\n104\n00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.020\nAnd those strands, if I were to tug\non them, could yank right out and\n\n105\n00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.320\nget displaced, right.\n\n106\n00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.349\nSo they're stuck in here,\nthere's a white one.\n\n107\n00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.620\nHere's the others.\n\n108\n00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.750\nWe've got, there's green,\norange, brown, and so on.\n\n109\n00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.650\nSo each of these are fiber strands\nthat are inside of this cable.\n\n110\n00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.000\nAnd each one is capable\nof carrying a signal.\n\n111\n00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.590\nAnd I can divide them up into pairs,\nand there's eight.\n\n112\n00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.480\nThis is really somewhat hard to see\nwith all this filler in the way.\n\n113\n00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.770\nBut there's eight different\nstrands in there, so\n\n114\n00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.800\nthat means I can make four pairs, right.\n\n115\n00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.080\nSo by running this one cable,\nI could carry four different connections.\n\n116\n00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.870\nAnd if I'm running 10 gig,\nI can have four 10 gig connections.\n\n117\n00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.620\nIf I had Cisco switches,\nI could do port aggregation.\n\n118\n00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.250\nAggregate them together,\nnow I've got a 40 gig link, right.\n\n119\n00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.870\nOr if I have a server with\nfour fiber connections in it,\n\n120\n00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.170\nthen I could connect these up and\ndo NIC teaming, or whatever, and\n\n121\n00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.530\nload balance across them\nto get increased bandwidth.\n\n122\n00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.720\nNow, in the very middle of this is\nsomething that looks like a fiber strand,\n\n123\n00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.840\nthis white one, but it isn't.\n\n124\n00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.010\nThis is actually a really\nstiff piece of plastic, right.\n\n125\n00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.160\nAnd that stiff piece of plastic is there\nto give some rigidity to this cable,\n\n126\n00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.410\nto make it a little stronger\nthan what we're used to.\n\n127\n00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.660\nThis cable is super pliable.\n\n128\n00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.720\nI can bend it, and twist it really easy.\n\n129\n00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.630\nThis cable is harder to bend, all right.\n\n130\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.988\nAnd there's a big reason for that,\na reason that I didn't talk about in\n\n131\n00:06:41.988 --> 00:06:43.574\nthe last episode that we\nneed to talk about now.\n\n132\n00:06:43.574 --> 00:06:48.380\nAnd that is we're shooting\na laser beam down this glass.\n\n133\n00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.780\nAnd lasers like to go in a straight line.\n\n134\n00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.270\nThis cable is no longer straight,\nit's curved.\n\n135\n00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.660\nSo the laser beam is actually\ngonna have to bend and curve.\n\n136\n00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:04.080\nWell, when you bend light, it refracts,\nand that means it loses a little energy.\n\n137\n00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.190\nAnd the more you bend the cable,\nthe more it refracts.\n\n138\n00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.920\nAnd, eventually, you bend it so much that\nthe light can't make it around the corner.\n\n139\n00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.980\nThink about if you're in your car, and\nyou come up on a curve on the road,\n\n140\n00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.330\nmaybe you can make it around\nat 45 miles an hour, but\n\n141\n00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.250\nyou can't make it around\nat 75 miles an hour, right.\n\n142\n00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.520\nThe bend is too sharp.\n\n143\n00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.570\nSo that's how fiber optics are, right.\n\n144\n00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:29.572\nIf you bend it too much,\nthe signal is not able to make that turn.\n\n145\n00:07:29.572 --> 00:07:31.420\nIt just gets tighter and\ntighter and tighter.\n\n146\n00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.120\nThat's not a good thing.\n\n147\n00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.760\nAnd really, if I wanted to go crazy,\nI could bend it even further and\n\n148\n00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.130\neventually, it'll snap\nbecause it is glass.\n\n149\n00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.650\nAnd, yes, it's in a pseudo, solid,\nliquid state so it can bend.\n\n150\n00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.240\nBut it'll still snap if\nyou bend it far enough.\n\n151\n00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.787\nAnd if that happens, maybe I can\ndo it with this old cable [LAUGH].\n\n152\n00:07:49.787 --> 00:07:53.260\nSo if it happens, if you bend it,\nsometimes you'll feel it pop,\n\n153\n00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.534\nsometimes you won't.\n\n154\n00:07:54.534 --> 00:07:59.022\nI didn't feel anything, that was\nanti-climatic, but this cable's ruined.\n\n155\n00:07:59.022 --> 00:08:00.379\nI guess I cut it in half\nin the last episode.\n\n156\n00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:01.520\nAnyway, so what does that matter?\n\n157\n00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.100\nBut if you bend it too much,\nthe signal's not gonna get through.\n\n158\n00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.930\nSo when you run fiber optic cabling,\nand you run it through the wall, or\n\n159\n00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.420\nyou run it in your server max,\nwhen you run that cabling\n\n160\n00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:15.420\nyou've really got to pay\nattention to how the cable bends.\n\n161\n00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.220\nAnd the recommendation is that\nany time there is a bend,\n\n162\n00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:24.060\nif you were to place a circle in that\nbend that the cable goes around,\n\n163\n00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:29.910\nthis circle should have\na diameter of two inches.\n\n164\n00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.380\nRight?\nSo, you should have a nice good curve that\n\n165\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.597\nwraps around effectively\na two-inch circle.\n\n166\n00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.750\nYou can get down to one inch and you'll be\nokay but that's really pushing the limit.\n\n167\n00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.900\nSo two inches is what\nmost people will go for.\n\n168\n00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.540\nAnd so when you see fiber\noptics run though a rack,\n\n169\n00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.340\nit's not normally just a cable run and\nthat's it.\n\n170\n00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.120\nThere's normally little devices.\n\n171\n00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.270\nThank you Wes.\n\n172\n00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.870\nMy lovely assistant Wes.\n\n173\n00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.410\nI guess you can't really see.\n\n174\n00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.350\nLet me put it over here.\n\n175\n00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:01.730\nSo you'll have things like this,\nwhoops, run all throughout the rack.\n\n176\n00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.720\nAnd what these little pieces of plastic do\n\n177\n00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.080\nis they give you a little tray\nthat you can lay the cable on.\n\n178\n00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:14.470\nAnd when the cable runs across this,\nit's gonna run across it and\n\n179\n00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.860\nI bend to take a turn right?\n\n180\n00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.990\nSo I'm just gonna bend here and\ntake a turn.\n\n181\n00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.465\nAnd because I'm run through\nthis plastic channel,\n\n182\n00:09:21.465 --> 00:09:26.935\nit's making sure that I don't bend any\nmore than I actually intend, right.\n\n183\n00:09:26.935 --> 00:09:30.645\nSo this forces me to\nobserve the bend radius and\n\n184\n00:09:30.645 --> 00:09:33.785\nto make sure that my signal doesn't get\ndestroyed cuz I went around a curb.\n\n185\n00:09:33.785 --> 00:09:36.975\nSo when you see fiber optics run through\na rack, you'll see a ton of these.\n\n186\n00:09:36.975 --> 00:09:41.505\nNow mine is black and I'm gonna show you\nwhy in a little bit because it actually\n\n187\n00:09:41.505 --> 00:09:43.640\nattaches to some black cable\nmanagement that I have.\n\n188\n00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.930\nBut a lot of times people will run these\nas yellow or grey so they stand out, so\n\n189\n00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.490\nthey're really easy to see.\n\n190\n00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.870\nAnd people know that's\nwhere the fiber runs.\n\n191\n00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.420\nBut you can run copper cabling\nthrough these too, and so\n\n192\n00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.780\nthe color doesn't matter.\n\n193\n00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.085\nBut the whole point of these things\nis to enforce that bend radius.\n\n194\n00:09:59.085 --> 00:10:02.001\nAnd so you'll see that if I\nwere to draw a circle in here,\n\n195\n00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:04.557\nthe diameter of that circle\nwould be two inches.\n\n196\n00:10:04.557 --> 00:10:07.355\nAnd that's gonna enforce that and\nmake sure I'm not bending too much.\n\n197\n00:10:07.355 --> 00:10:08.928\nSo always be careful with that,\nwhen you run it.\n\n198\n00:10:08.928 --> 00:10:11.709\nWhen you're plugging into a server,\nwhen a server's in a rack,\n\n199\n00:10:11.709 --> 00:10:14.661\nyou're normally gonna have a cable\nmanagement arm on that, right?\n\n200\n00:10:14.661 --> 00:10:17.866\nAnd those cable management arms\nare designed to scissor out as\n\n201\n00:10:17.866 --> 00:10:19.290\nthe server opens, right?\n\n202\n00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:23.400\nSo you run the cable up through it, and as\nit scissors out the cable is now straight.\n\n203\n00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.850\nAnd then when you push the server back in,\nit closes, and now the cable is bent.\n\n204\n00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:31.990\nWell when it closes, that bend is\noftentimes too sharp for fiber.\n\n205\n00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.240\nAnd so, if you run cable\nthrough a fiber management arm,\n\n206\n00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.780\nyou have to be really careful with that.\n\n207\n00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.800\nAnd they do sell special\nadaptors that help with that.\n\n208\n00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:45.000\nBut the better thing to do is not to use\nthe cable management arms on a server.\n\n209\n00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.830\nThey're great.\n\n210\n00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.520\nThey make things look nice and neat.\n\n211\n00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.170\nBut you'd be better off running the cable\nand bundling it together to keep it nice\n\n212\n00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.160\nand neat and knowing that your bend radius\nis maintained if you're running fiber.\n\n213\n00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.130\nIf you're running copper,\nuse the cable management arms like crazy.\n\n214\n00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:03.520\nCopper can take a ton of bend and\nbe okay, but Fiber optics, not so much.\n\n215\n00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.640\nSo that brings me to cable management.\n\n216\n00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.370\nI've mentioned cable\nmanagement a few times.\n\n217\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.460\nIt's kind of the title of the episode.\n\n218\n00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.530\nWe've been talking about\nall these different cables.\n\n219\n00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:16.170\nAnd if I'm gonna run those through a\nserver rack and start to get things hooked\n\n220\n00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:19.530\nup, I need to make sure that I\nmaintain the cables properly.\n\n221\n00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.370\nNow, you don't have to.\n\n222\n00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.670\nYou don't have to do\nanything special to cables.\n\n223\n00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.260\nYou could just run them and\nplug them in and off you go.\n\n224\n00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.560\nBut it creates a lot of\nproblems down the road.\n\n225\n00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.330\nAnd let me show you\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n226\n00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:34.360\nThey had a contest on Reddit not too\nlong ago, where they invited people to\n\n227\n00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:39.520\npost pictures of the worst server rack\nthey'd seen and people post something like\n\n228\n00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.500\nI've worked in some environments where\nthe cable networks were just a nightmare.\n\n229\n00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.640\nBut you'll see people where\nthey post racks like this one.\n\n230\n00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.350\nAnd if you look at it,\nyou can tell what happened here.\n\n231\n00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.320\nOver the years, they added devices.\n\n232\n00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.500\nThey added ports.\n\n233\n00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.190\nAnd people just ran cables\nwherever they could.\n\n234\n00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.880\nAnd now, you've got a mess.\n\n235\n00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.460\nOkay, so what's the negative, there?\n\n236\n00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.580\nWhen somebody runs cabling like this,\nwhat's the negative?\n\n237\n00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:08.390\nFirst off, it becomes really\nchallenging to troubleshoot.\n\n238\n00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.310\nIf I have a device that's having\na problem, and I need to make sure\n\n239\n00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:16.570\nit's patched into the right port,\nhow do I know where it's plugged in?\n\n240\n00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:21.470\nI can guarantee you that people who did\nthis didn't keep great documentation.\n\n241\n00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.840\nYou're not gonna find somebody who's an\namazing person at documentation that runs\n\n242\n00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.960\ncables like this.\n\n243\n00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.690\nPeople are usually meticulous on both or\nnot meticulous on either.\n\n244\n00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.530\nIn this scenario, it becomes really\nchallenging to troubleshoot,\n\n245\n00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:34.310\nto trace cables.\n\n246\n00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.440\nYou gotta follow along and\nget a tone generator.\n\n247\n00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.620\nYou gotta unplug things to figure\nout where they're plugged in.\n\n248\n00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:39.680\nIt's a nightmare.\n\n249\n00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.880\nIt is hard to maintain and\ntroubleshoot in the environment like this.\n\n250\n00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.780\nBut it happens, people get in a hurry,\nthey throw a cable and they're like,\n\n251\n00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.310\nI'll go back and fix it later.\n\n252\n00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.990\nAnd they never do, right?\n\n253\n00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.120\nBut there are some, actually there was\none that I was really impressed with and\n\n254\n00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.920\nthe only way to find it, yeah this one.\n\n255\n00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.600\nWhere this rack is pretty bad,\nyou've got your patch panels up top and\n\n256\n00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.600\nswitches at the bottom and cables\nare just a mess and they took a weekend\n\n257\n00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.380\nwhere the staff was out, and\nthey went through and they cleaned it up.\n\n258\n00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:07.910\nAnd look at that.\n\n259\n00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.420\nI mean, it's just beautiful.\n\n260\n00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.010\nThe way that's arranged,\nall the cables are nice and tidied up.\n\n261\n00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.000\nThey still have some loose\ncable down here, but\n\n262\n00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.140\nit's still in bundles which is\nway nicer than it was before.\n\n263\n00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.620\nNow you can easily see everything\nis much easier to work with.\n\n264\n00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.840\nAll right, so why bother?\n\n265\n00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.840\nLike, when you look at\nthe server rack behind us,\n\n266\n00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.034\nwhy did we bother running\nall of that nice and neat?\n\n267\n00:13:28.034 --> 00:13:29.220\nAll right, two reasons.\n\n268\n00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.380\nOne, it's easier to work with.\n\n269\n00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.930\nThat we can get in there and\nfind ports and\n\n270\n00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.936\npatch them much more quickly\nbecause we can see everything.\n\n271\n00:13:34.936 --> 00:13:38.130\nAnd two, air flow.\n\n272\n00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:40.840\nWhen you look at a rack,\nespecially a server rack.\n\n273\n00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.800\nAnd it has cables just pouring\ndown the front, or the back,\n\n274\n00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.480\nfor that matter,\nboth sides have connectors.\n\n275\n00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.780\nIf the cables are pouring down,\nthey obstruct airflow.\n\n276\n00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.320\nYour servers need to be able to\nsuck cool air in from the front and\n\n277\n00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.030\nthey need to be able to\nblow hot air out the back.\n\n278\n00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.750\nIf either one is blocked,\nthat causes a problem.\n\n279\n00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:03.910\nIf I can't suck the cool air in,\nthen I'm gonna put a strain on my fans and\n\n280\n00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.490\nthe fans are gonna die early, right?\n\n281\n00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.570\nAnd that means my server's\ngonna go offline.\n\n282\n00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:11.040\nAnd if I'm not sucking the cool air in,\nthen the server's gonna get hot and\n\n283\n00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.130\nI'm gonna go into thermal shut down.\n\n284\n00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:17.020\nAnd if I can't blow the hot air out,\nthe hot air is just gonna build up and\n\n285\n00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.930\nagain, I'm gonna have a thermal shut own.\n\n286\n00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.540\nEither one is gonna affect\nthe availability of my systems, so\n\n287\n00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:27.240\nI need to have clear airways in front and\nbehind of the servers.\n\n288\n00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.050\nOn network gear, on switches and\n\n289\n00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.420\nrouters, a lot of them actually\ndo side-to-side ventilation.\n\n290\n00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.790\nSo the HP switch that's behind us\nover here, that one does side-to-side\n\n291\n00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:39.060\nventilation, it sucks in air from\none side and blows it out the other.\n\n292\n00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:43.640\nServers, I'm gonna user the word never and\nI shouldn't cuz never's a big word and\n\n293\n00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.645\nten people will send me emails about\nservers and how they are different.\n\n294\n00:14:47.645 --> 00:14:51.610\nMost servers bring air in from\nthe front and blow air out the back.\n\n295\n00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:52.980\nRight, they don't do side-to-side.\n\n296\n00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.970\nAnd the reason is, they've got hard\ndrives, they've got memory chips,\n\n297\n00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:00.890\nthey've got a CPU and they've got power\nsupplies, and they all need to be cooled.\n\n298\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.110\nAnd it's super easy to line them\nup along the length of a rack,\n\n299\n00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.630\nracks are deep, right?\n\n300\n00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:06.380\nRacks aren't wide.\n\n301\n00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.230\nYou get 19 inches of width and that's it.\n\n302\n00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.690\nSo you can't line up all of those in\n19 inches and do side to side cooling.\n\n303\n00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:12.720\nIt just doesn't work out.\n\n304\n00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.840\nIn a switch or a router,\nyeah, you can do it.\n\n305\n00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.800\nIn a server, not so much.\n\n306\n00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.140\nAnd then, with server racks, the server\nracks are normally side by side.\n\n307\n00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.560\nSo if I was doing side to side cooling,\nI'd be sucking in air from one rack and\n\n308\n00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.345\nblowing air into the other rack,\nand that doesn't work.\n\n309\n00:15:27.345 --> 00:15:30.580\nFront-to-front though, we keep those\nairways open because we need to be able to\n\n310\n00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.440\nwalk in front of and behind the racks.\n\n311\n00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.360\nSo it makes more sense,\nwe need to keep cables out of the way.\n\n312\n00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.610\nSo by doing good cable management,\nyou make that happen.\n\n313\n00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:43.580\nNow when you've got a massive device like\na switch, it's got a ton of cables running\n\n314\n00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.990\ninto it, it's hard to keep\nthe cables out of the way.\n\n315\n00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.780\nWhen you've got a server,\nthe server might only be one U.\n\n316\n00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.180\nIt's really thin.\n\n317\n00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.301\nHow do you keep the cables out of the way?\n\n318\n00:15:52.301 --> 00:15:55.764\nAnd the solution,\nis cable management equipment, right.\n\n319\n00:15:55.764 --> 00:15:59.389\nThis little plastic wing,\nthat I held up, this is one piece,\n\n320\n00:15:59.389 --> 00:16:01.358\nof a cable management solution.\n\n321\n00:16:01.358 --> 00:16:05.501\nInside of your rack you're gonna\nuse vertical and horizontal cable\n\n322\n00:16:05.501 --> 00:16:10.371\nManagement like the name apply vertical\nis over managing the cables going up and\n\n323\n00:16:10.371 --> 00:16:14.951\ndown through the rack and then horizontals\nremeasure going through left or\n\n324\n00:16:14.951 --> 00:16:19.190\nright I say up and down you never\nwanna have cables on the floor.\n\n325\n00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:20.810\nIt's a trip hazard if nothing else.\n\n326\n00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.740\nBut it's easier to kick a cable and\nunplug something.\n\n327\n00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.940\nSo when you walk into a data center,\nthere should be no cables on the floor.\n\n328\n00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.510\nYou might have subfloor, all right?\n\n329\n00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:31.620\nRemovable flooring that you can pop up and\nthe cables run underneath it.\n\n330\n00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.220\nAnd that's fine because\nyou can't step on that.\n\n331\n00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.000\nWhen the floor is closed,\nyou're walking on top of it.\n\n332\n00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.660\nBut most people are gonna run their\ncabling through the ceiling, right?\n\n333\n00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.860\nTaylor, can we see\nthe server right behind us?\n\n334\n00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.020\nWhen you look at the servers behind me,\nwhat you'll notice is that there's\n\n335\n00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.880\nactually a little ladder that runs\nacross the top of the racks, and that's\n\n336\n00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.970\nhorizontal cable management, and I guess\nit's a little off the top of the screen.\n\n337\n00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:58.010\nBut, basically, we've got a bunch of\ncables that are running right across\n\n338\n00:16:58.010 --> 00:16:59.700\nthe top ff those racks.\n\n339\n00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.430\nSo that when somebody walks into\nthe server room they can walk in front and\n\n340\n00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:03.070\nbehind and\n\n341\n00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.990\nthey don't have to worry about tripping\nover a cable or bumping into something.\n\n342\n00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:08.160\nIt's run horizontally.\n\n343\n00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.580\nAnd it's really just a metal\nladder that's run sideways.\n\n344\n00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.480\nAnd so we can feed cabling through there.\n\n345\n00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.150\nAnd it's a ladder.\n\n346\n00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:18.870\nIt's got rungs so you can use velcro or\nzip ties to lock it in place.\n\n347\n00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:20.410\nYou can see it right there.\n\n348\n00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.400\nSee how the cables jump\nin between the racks.\n\n349\n00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.150\nThey're not just magically\nlevitating there.\n\n350\n00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.930\nThere's actually a ladder that's holding\nthem up and letting them cross between.\n\n351\n00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.980\nThere's that big bundle of blue\ncables that are running across and\n\n352\n00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.400\nthen some other ones.\n\n353\n00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.170\nThey might be security cameras.\n\n354\n00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:35.600\nThey might be desktops.\n\n355\n00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.530\nThey might be laptops.\n\n356\n00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:38.600\nWho knows what's on the other\nends of those cables, but\n\n357\n00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.080\nthey're all run nice and neat.\n\n358\n00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:44.870\nAnd they'll run horizontally like that\nuntil they get to the right rack and\n\n359\n00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.120\nthey'll drop down vertically\nto get down to the equipment.\n\n360\n00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.300\nSo you got the horizontal cable management\nlike that but then runs into vertical.\n\n361\n00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.790\nAnd West,\nwould you mind running into the server.\n\n362\n00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:55.570\n&gt;&gt; Not at all.\n\n363\n00:17:55.570 --> 00:18:00.680\n&gt;&gt; Let's show the vertical side of this.\n\n364\n00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.960\nSo West, we're gonna break all\nthe rules in this episode and\n\n365\n00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.200\nthen we're gonna have\nsomebody walk off the set but\n\n366\n00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.440\nwhat you'll see is in between each\nrack there's a hidden compartment.\n\n367\n00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.950\nThere's a vertical cable manager\nthat has a little door on it, and\n\n368\n00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.470\nthe cables up and down through that door.\n\n369\n00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.510\nSo West is going to go in there and\n\n370\n00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:19.320\nhe's going to open up one of those so\nwe can see it.\n\n371\n00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.950\nBecause right now, when we look you\njust see black in between the racks,\n\n372\n00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:26.730\nyou don't actually see anything crazy,\nbut when he goes in there and\n\n373\n00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:30.120\nopens that door, what we're gonna see,\nyeah, right there.\n\n374\n00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.255\nSee the big bundles of orange cables?\n\n375\n00:18:32.255 --> 00:18:34.332\nThat's all hidden inside of\nthis vertical cable manager.\n\n376\n00:18:34.332 --> 00:18:38.183\nSo it takes all those cables to the side,\ngets them out of the way,\n\n377\n00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:41.492\nout of the way of air flow,\nand visibility and all that.\n\n378\n00:18:41.492 --> 00:18:43.758\nAnd then you close it up and\nthey're bundled away, and\n\n379\n00:18:43.758 --> 00:18:47.022\nyou'll see we've used velcro on them\nall just kind of bundled them together.\n\n380\n00:18:47.022 --> 00:18:51.666\nA lot of people use zip-ties, and that's\nfine if you know the cables are permanent.\n\n381\n00:18:51.666 --> 00:18:55.532\nI'll tell you right now, cables are never\npermanent, so having velcro like that,\n\n382\n00:18:55.532 --> 00:18:59.380\nyou can undo the cable, add new cable\nback in, and keep things nice and tidy.\n\n383\n00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.320\nSo thank you Wes.\n\n384\n00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.410\nSo that's an example of vertical\ncable management on a large scale.\n\n385\n00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:09.210\nOn a smaller scale, once you get into rack\n\n386\n00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.590\nyou might have equipment that has a bunch\nof cables that run into it like a switch.\n\n387\n00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.260\nAnd so for that you can use smaller,\n\n388\n00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.540\nhorizontal cable managers like this\none that I'm holding here in my hand.\n\n389\n00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.510\nAnd when you use these,\n\n390\n00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:25.300\nwhat they normally have if you look at\nthem, is they have a bunch of teeth.\n\n391\n00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:29.720\nAnd I guess if we can return back\nto our sky camera, whatever,\n\n392\n00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.530\nI'm doing all sorts of\ncrazy cameras today.\n\n393\n00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:36.190\nIf you look at this, you'll see it's\ngot these big teeth on it, right?\n\n394\n00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:40.920\nAnd I'm gonna just take these covers off\nso you can see it without the covers.\n\n395\n00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.720\nThere, that's what it actually\nlooks like right there.\n\n396\n00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.120\nAnd the reason it's got teeth, is so\n\n397\n00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.330\nthat the cables can pop into\nthese little slots really easily.\n\n398\n00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:54.780\nSo, if I had a switch on top of this, a\ncable can come out the front and what did\n\n399\n00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:58.790\nwe do with our Cat 5, here, Cat 5 cable\nhanger, Cat 6, whatever this thing is.\n\n400\n00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:01.280\nA cable can be plugged into a switch,\nright?\n\n401\n00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.550\nBut, I gotta a lot of cable here, so\n\n402\n00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:08.270\nI can come vertically down\nthe rack Into this, run across and\n\n403\n00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:12.570\nthen come right up that little notch and\nplug into my switch, right?\n\n404\n00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:17.810\nNow, when I do that and I'm done.\n\n405\n00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:21.570\nI can put this door on the front and\n\n406\n00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:26.070\nnow all I see is this tiny cable that\npops right up and plugs into the switch.\n\n407\n00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:30.570\nAnd now I'm not obstructing air flow, the\nswitch has clear airflow forward and back.\n\n408\n00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.550\nAnd the cable runs right in nice and neat.\n\n409\n00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.140\nAnd I can run more cables.\n\n410\n00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:39.320\nAnd if I have extra cable, right,\nmaybe I need a five foot cable,\n\n411\n00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.470\nbut all I have laying around\nare seven foot cables, right?\n\n412\n00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:42.120\nIt happens all the time.\n\n413\n00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.530\nWhat do you do with the excess?\n\n414\n00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.970\nDo you just let it pour out the front\nof the rack onto the floor?\n\n415\n00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:47.420\nNo, you can bundle it up.\n\n416\n00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.740\nSo we can take that cable.\n\n417\n00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:54.860\nAnd I usually just kind of wrap\nit up a little bit like that.\n\n418\n00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.840\nAnd you can stick a piece of\nvelcro on it so it holds.\n\n419\n00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.771\nAnd you can take that little loop and\n\n420\n00:21:00.771 --> 00:21:05.272\nstick it in right inside of\nthe door like that, right.\n\n421\n00:21:05.272 --> 00:21:09.722\nAnd shut the door on the front, and now\nyou've taken up the slack of that cable so\n\n422\n00:21:09.722 --> 00:21:12.195\nit just some kinda disappears right there.\n\n423\n00:21:12.195 --> 00:21:13.873\nIt pops right into that tray and\n\n424\n00:21:13.873 --> 00:21:18.345\nnow I've got this cable that can run into\nthe switch,or server or whatever it is.\n\n425\n00:21:18.345 --> 00:21:21.661\nAnd this runs on to wherever it\nneeds to run and there we go.\n\n426\n00:21:21.661 --> 00:21:25.173\nCable management solutions like\nthese are not terribly expensive.\n\n427\n00:21:25.173 --> 00:21:27.170\nIt's just a matter of getting them and\nputting them in place.\n\n428\n00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:28.250\nA lot of people don't.\n\n429\n00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:31.080\nA lot of people look at these and\nsay that eats up a lot of rack space.\n\n430\n00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.173\nThis is.\n\n431\n00:21:32.173 --> 00:21:35.560\nI could have two servers in this space,\nbut I'm wasting it with cable management.\n\n432\n00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.810\nWell, you're not wasting it.\n\n433\n00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:39.880\nYou're preserving your other servers by\nmaking sure they have proper ventilation\n\n434\n00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.890\nand air flow.\n\n435\n00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.200\nAnd letting that run\nlike it's supposed to.\n\n436\n00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.370\n&gt;&gt; And Don, with your bend radius,\nthe protection there.\n\n437\n00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.090\nThis is just gonna be something that's\ngonna be attached to the top of the rock\n\n438\n00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.540\nor at a certain point in the rack?\n\n439\n00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:50.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Depending on how they do it.\n\n440\n00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:53.350\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so let's say that I had\nfiber running down vertically.\n\n441\n00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.420\nAnd it needed to come in here and\ngo horizontal, right.\n\n442\n00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.160\nSo I can take this little elbow\nthat I showed you guys earlier\n\n443\n00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.850\ntake that door back off.\n\n444\n00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:04.600\nOkay, I can take this elbow and\nif I'm coming,\n\n445\n00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.050\nlets just say the cable is coming down.\n\n446\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.660\nAnd then it needs to come into here right?\n\n447\n00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:14.480\nI can pop that elbow right under here and\nfix it.\n\n448\n00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:19.340\nSo now when you look at that you'll\nsee where the cable could come.\n\n449\n00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.240\nDown this way and bend right in and\n\n450\n00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.830\nwe don't have to worry about\nexceeding the bond radius.\n\n451\n00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:29.470\nSo I use the yellow cable cause\nit's a little bit brighter but\n\n452\n00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:32.110\nit would just come down and\nrunning like that and\n\n453\n00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:37.600\nI know the bend radius is being preserve\ncause I got this curve elbow right here.\n\n454\n00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.520\nThat make sure that we keep that safe and\nintact.\n\n455\n00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.000\nSo that's an important thing to have to\nmake sure that everything's working right.\n\n456\n00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.580\nAnd by getting removable arms like this,\nyou can pop them in and\n\n457\n00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:47.490\nout wherever you need them.\n\n458\n00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:48.790\nBecause you might not\nneed them everywhere.\n\n459\n00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:52.490\nIf I just have copper in here,\nI'm not gonna put these elbow on there.\n\n460\n00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.330\nI'm gonna put elbows on\nthere when I've go fiber.\n\n461\n00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.400\nThat's where you're gonna use it.\n\n462\n00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.400\nThey make other ones that\nlook a little different.\n\n463\n00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.840\nBut it's all the same job,\nand they snap right on.\n\n464\n00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.830\nThis example here that I'm using?\n\n465\n00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.000\nIt's from a company called Leviton.\n\n466\n00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.550\nIn the cable management world,\nyou're gonna see Leviton and Panduit.\n\n467\n00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:14.900\nThose are the two big guys.\n\n468\n00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.840\nThis is Leviton everything that you see\nin our server room behind us is Panduit.\n\n469\n00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:23.450\nIf you were to ask me which one is better,\nI don't know that I could say.\n\n470\n00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:27.320\nThey both make very similar products,\nthey all work really well.\n\n471\n00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.800\nSo usually I just look at whatever\nwe've already deployed and\n\n472\n00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:31.930\nstick with that brand.\n\n473\n00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.130\nBut, the Panduit and\nLeviton are a two big ones.\n\n474\n00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:36.940\nThere's plenty of others that\nout there too, and off brands.\n\n475\n00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:41.010\nWhat's important is you just get cable\nmanagement and you stick with it.\n\n476\n00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:45.235\nYou make sure you run your cable nice and\nneat, makes it easy to troubleshoot,\n\n477\n00:23:45.235 --> 00:23:48.774\npreserves airflow and\nit's doing things the right way, right.\n\n478\n00:23:48.774 --> 00:23:53.093\nWell, for those of you who watched our\nserver hardware episode you saw a cable\n\n479\n00:23:53.093 --> 00:23:57.682\nmanagement arms, that's another part of\nit that runs to Servers and switches and\n\n480\n00:23:57.682 --> 00:23:59.026\nstaff on the back side.\n\n481\n00:23:59.026 --> 00:24:00.038\nThis is what we would use for\n\n482\n00:24:00.038 --> 00:24:02.989\nequipment that didn't necessarily have\ncable management arms built into it.\n\n483\n00:24:02.989 --> 00:24:04.662\nSome equipments does.\n\n484\n00:24:04.662 --> 00:24:08.749\nBut these things are pretty commonplace,\nand they just pop right in the rack and\n\n485\n00:24:08.749 --> 00:24:09.420\noff they go.\n\n486\n00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:13.481\nOne other word of caution.\n\n487\n00:24:13.481 --> 00:24:16.302\nWhen you use cable management like\nthis you're bundling cables together,\n\n488\n00:24:16.302 --> 00:24:18.470\ncables are getting really close.\n\n489\n00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:21.620\nIf it's copper, and\nit's fiber, they can coexist.\n\n490\n00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.750\nThey can come really close and\nit's no big deal.\n\n491\n00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.143\nIf it's power, be careful.\n\n492\n00:24:26.143 --> 00:24:30.950\nWith power, it creates a lot of EMF,\nthere's a lot of electromagnetic\n\n493\n00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:35.850\ninterference and that EMF can bleed over\nfrom a power cable into a copper cable.\n\n494\n00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:39.160\nNot gonna mess with your fiber, fiber\nyou don't get interference like that.\n\n495\n00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.140\nFiber is great.\n\n496\n00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.010\nBut on your copper you\nwill get interference.\n\n497\n00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:45.650\nSo typically you don't want to run power\n\n498\n00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:49.780\nin the same cable management\nas your copper, as your data.\n\n499\n00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.530\nSo normally what we'll see\nis on the front of the rack,\n\n500\n00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.940\nwe'll have cable management for\nthe network cabling, and\n\n501\n00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:58.230\non the back of the rack,\nwe'll have cable management for the power.\n\n502\n00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:02.310\nOr like that ladder on top of our rack,\nyou can't see it on camera,\n\n503\n00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:05.200\nbut on the front of the ladder is\nwhere we have all our data, and\n\n504\n00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.060\non the back of the ladder\nis where we have our power.\n\n505\n00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.690\nSo there's actually\na separation in between,\n\n506\n00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.420\nthe middle part of that ladder is empty.\n\n507\n00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:14.210\nNow, somebody could come in and run some\nmore cable and say, this spot's empty,\n\n508\n00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.990\nI'll just run right through it.\n\n509\n00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.810\nAnd now they've got data\ntouching the power.\n\n510\n00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.932\nIt's not gonna shock you or anything\nIt's just gonna degrade your signal,\n\n511\n00:25:20.932 --> 00:25:23.421\nyou're gonna start seeing\nre-transmits on your network,\n\n512\n00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:26.171\nyou're gonna start seeing CRC\nfailures on your frame checksums.\n\n513\n00:25:26.171 --> 00:25:30.660\nThat kind of stuff happens and it's just\nbecause of cabling run the wrong way.\n\n514\n00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.990\nI've only got one other thing to mention,\n\n515\n00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:39.720\nat least as I recall before we wrap this\nturkey up, and that is, let's see I talked\n\n516\n00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.531\nabout cable ties, talked about bend\nradius, talked about labeling.\n\n517\n00:25:44.531 --> 00:25:46.720\nPlenum, let me mention plenum.\n\n518\n00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.050\nWhen you get copper cabling a lot of times\nyou see an option to get plenum cabling.\n\n519\n00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:55.660\nPlenum really has nothing to do\nwith data and bandwidth and speed.\n\n520\n00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.680\nPlenum has to do with fire control.\n\n521\n00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.370\nWhen you run cable through the ceiling and\n\n522\n00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:06.940\nthrough walls, network cabling can\nkind of act like a candle wick.\n\n523\n00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.970\nIf you light one end of it,\nit just burns along to the other end.\n\n524\n00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:15.050\nSo if you have cable and run from room to\nroom to room, and one end catches fire,\n\n525\n00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:18.770\nthe cabling can actually spread\nthat fire throughout the building.\n\n526\n00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:23.220\nNot everywhere, but a lot of places\nhave a building code that requires any\n\n527\n00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.920\ncabling run through the ceiling,\nto be plenum.\n\n528\n00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.820\nAnd the plenum cabling, if you light it on\nfire, it does burn, but it just burns and\n\n529\n00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:31.540\ndies out right there.\n\n530\n00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:32.660\nIt doesn't actually wick, or\n\n531\n00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.820\nit doesn't carry along that\ncable to the rest of the way.\n\n532\n00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.354\nThere's something about an air gap\ninside of it that creates that,\n\n533\n00:26:38.354 --> 00:26:40.094\nI don't actually know\nthe science behind it.\n\n534\n00:26:40.094 --> 00:26:44.960\nI just know that it doesn't combust and\ntravel like normal cabling.\n\n535\n00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.900\nSo when you're doing structured wiring,\nplenum really matters.\n\n536\n00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.130\nIn a data center though, all your\ncables are right here, they start and\n\n537\n00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:54.410\nfinish right here, and so\nplenum cabling is not a concern.\n\n538\n00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:55.610\nYou can still do it if you want,\n\n539\n00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:59.220\nbut there's not really a benefit cuz if\na fire breaks out in your data center\n\n540\n00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.280\nit can spread just because it's one\ndata center, it's all right there.\n\n541\n00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:06.260\nSo you should have fire control also which\nwe'll talk about more in another episode.\n\n542\n00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.370\nBut, plenum really won't\nmake a difference.\n\n543\n00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:09.920\nSo if you've got it, great,\n\n544\n00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.010\nif you don't have it, not a big deal\nwhen you're talking about a data center.\n\n545\n00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.900\nWell Wes, I think that pretty\nmuch wraps everything up.\n\n546\n00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:24.510\nThe only other toy that I didn't get to\nhere is, we talked about all the category\n\n547\n00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:31.050\nfive cabling, we talked about the fiber\nconnectors like SC and LC and ST.\n\n548\n00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.740\nSo we got through all those.\n\n549\n00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:37.300\nI mentioned RJ45 connectors, but\nI didn't really talk about them much.\n\n550\n00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:42.820\nSo let me just if I can get this package\nopen, show you guys an RJ45 connector for\n\n551\n00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:46.300\ncompleteness to make sure we\nhit all of our exam objectives.\n\n552\n00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.340\nWes, can you hand me that orange cable\nthat I cable managed a moment ago, so\n\n553\n00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.950\nI'm gonna make that as\nhard as possible for you.\n\n554\n00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:56.080\nWith fiber we don't normally\nterminate the ends.\n\n555\n00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.160\nIf you wanna put an end on\na fiber optic cable you\n\n556\n00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.650\nneed a termination kit because you've\ngotta be able to cut the glass perfectly.\n\n557\n00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:07.200\nYou've gotta be able to polish the glass\ncuz it can't have any flaws on the end it.\n\n558\n00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.560\nWhich, when you cut something,\nit naturally gets flaws.\n\n559\n00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.020\nSo you gotta be able to\npolish the glass and\n\n560\n00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.400\nclean it, and then you gotta be\nable to terminate the end on it.\n\n561\n00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.920\nSo you need a termination kit, those\ntermination kits cost like 1,200 bucks.\n\n562\n00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.220\nIf you're a professional cabler,\nthat makes sense.\n\n563\n00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.700\nBut if you're a sysadmin,\nit absolutely doesn't make sense.\n\n564\n00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:22.948\nAnd you're not gonna do\na good job on it anyway.\n\n565\n00:28:22.948 --> 00:28:25.223\nThe professional cablers do\na great job on this stuff.\n\n566\n00:28:25.223 --> 00:28:28.090\nSo, we don't normally terminate fiber.\n\n567\n00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:32.140\nBut when it comes to copper,\nyou can terminate it yourself.\n\n568\n00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:36.990\nYou can buy a package of RJ45\nends like this one here,\n\n569\n00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:39.570\nthat just has a collection of RJ45 ends.\n\n570\n00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:43.940\nNow, be careful when you get these\nbecause just like the cable,\n\n571\n00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.850\nthese have a rating also.\n\n572\n00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:49.510\nIf you've got category five e or\ncategory six cables, and\n\n573\n00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:53.310\nyou have old category five ends,\nyour cable is now on category five cable,\n\n574\n00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:57.770\nit doesn't matter their actual wire\nis six, the ends just overrode that.\n\n575\n00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:01.580\nSo if I look at this package,\nthis is actually a Cat5e package.\n\n576\n00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.260\nSo when I take this out,\nif it wasn't on the package,\n\n577\n00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.530\nI would have no idea of knowing this\nis Cat5e, is Cat6, I have no clue.\n\n578\n00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:11.700\nThey don't write it on here as far as\nI know, so I'd have no way of telling.\n\n579\n00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.150\nSo you gotta pay attention\nto that packaging.\n\n580\n00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.560\nYou gotta keep them together so\nyou don't mix that up.\n\n581\n00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.820\nBut you can terminate these, for\nthose of you that did Network Plus,\n\n582\n00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.510\nyou've already learned how to do it.\n\n583\n00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:24.380\nBut basically you just arrange your wires,\nand with a crimper you can snap that on.\n\n584\n00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:27.881\nThe crimper, unlike a fiber\ntermination kit, a crimper is,\n\n585\n00:29:27.881 --> 00:29:29.844\nyou can get a cheap one for $30.\n\n586\n00:29:29.844 --> 00:29:31.870\nSo it becomes a lot more practical.\n\n587\n00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:35.510\nBut be careful,\nwhen cables are made at the factory,\n\n588\n00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.370\nthey get tested and certified.\n\n589\n00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:41.690\nWhen you make a cable yourself,\nit's not getting tested and certified.\n\n590\n00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:45.710\nSo it may work but it may not work\nto 100 meters like it's suppose to.\n\n591\n00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:51.670\nWe make the joke around here that's\nthere's three cabling standards,\n\n592\n00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:56.400\nthere's 568A, 568B, and\n568W, 568W is 568 Wes and\n\n593\n00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.975\nthat cable has a 50/50 chance of working.\n\n594\n00:29:58.975 --> 00:29:59.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n595\n00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:04.275\nwe're not even gonna talk about that,\nthe heck with the 55 meters or Cat6,\n\n596\n00:30:04.275 --> 00:30:07.260\nwe'll just be lucky if we\nget a link light [LAUGH].\n\n597\n00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.160\n&gt;&gt; So if you terminate your own cable,\nmy first suggestion would be don't,\n\n598\n00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:11.780\nthere's that.\n\n599\n00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.190\nBut if you're on a budget or\n\n600\n00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:17.060\nif you just wanna custom cut the links\nin cables you certainly can.\n\n601\n00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:21.470\nThe ends just make sure you get the same\ncategory standard as your cabling, and\n\n602\n00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:24.468\nthen you can get a crimper,\nthe crimper is the same for Cat5,\n\n603\n00:30:24.468 --> 00:30:27.720\nCat6E Cat6 all RJ45 that's the same.\n\n604\n00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.030\nBut make sure the ends\nmatch the cabling and\n\n605\n00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:32.500\nthe other thing is,\ninvest in a cable tester.\n\n606\n00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:36.950\nAnd I don't mean just a little signal pair\ntester, those you can get for 35 bucks but\n\n607\n00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:41.560\nusually for $300 or $400,\nyou can get a cable certifier.\n\n608\n00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.000\nIt's a little box that you stick\non one end of the cable and\n\n609\n00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.910\nit can certify the cable, it can\nmeasure it, it checks the impedance or\n\n610\n00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.610\nwhatever it is, the resistance and\n\n611\n00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:54.670\nall that, and it can identify if\nthere's a break in the line and so on.\n\n612\n00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:58.140\nAnd it prints out a little receipt\nthat certifies that cable.\n\n613\n00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.780\nIf you're a contractor that does cabling,\nyou probably already have one of those.\n\n614\n00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.760\nIf you're a sys admin,\nthough, you probably don't.\n\n615\n00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.070\nAnd you might be thinking,\nI don't need that, that's junk.\n\n616\n00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:08.950\nBut if you're custom cutting your own\ncable, and you wanna make sure you're\n\n617\n00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:12.830\nrunning the best cable possible into your\nservers, and providing that connectivity,\n\n618\n00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:15.270\nthat cable certifier will\nmake sure that you've got it.\n\n619\n00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:17.630\nAnd it'll be one less thing to worry\nabout when it comes time to troubleshoot.\n\n620\n00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:21.480\nYou'll know your cables are good.\n\n621\n00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.582\nAll right Wes,\ncan you think anything we left out?\n\n622\n00:31:22.582 --> 00:31:25.520\n&gt;&gt; No, other than which\nyou've already talked about.\n\n623\n00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.190\nYou talked a little bit about labelling,\njust making sure that our cables\n\n624\n00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:32.110\nare marked right and you've already\nmentioned that when you talked about\n\n625\n00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:35.150\nthe fiber pairs, making sure that\nthey're not twisted if you will.\n\n626\n00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:35.660\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n627\n00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I think that's about it and\na lot of great toys,\n\n628\n00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.230\nlot of great information and remember,\n\n629\n00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:43.840\ncable management can be a nightmare\nas Don's already showed you.\n\n630\n00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.390\nSo make sure when you start out\nyou just follow that consistency.\n\n631\n00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:50.370\nNow Don does look like we're coming to the\nend of another episode but before we do,\n\n632\n00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:53.880\ndo you have any additional word of wisdom\nyou'd like to impart to the viewers?\n\n633\n00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.220\n&gt;&gt; No, that's just about it for us here.\n\n634\n00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.140\nJust remember,\ngetting your server room nice and\n\n635\n00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.270\nneat, that's only part of the challenge.\n\n636\n00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:02.840\nKeeping it nice and neat,\nthat's the hard part.\n\n637\n00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.130\nSo cable management is a ongoing activity.\n\n638\n00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.090\nYou need to constantly be monitoring and\nmaking sure that, people\n\n639\n00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:11.090\nget in a hurry they start troubleshooting\nthings, you gotta come back afterwards,\n\n640\n00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:14.960\nclean things up, get it put back, so make\nthat a part of your ongoing activities.\n\n641\n00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.630\n&gt;&gt; Well Don we appreciate\nyour info on this subject and\n\n642\n00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.610\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n643\n00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:23.330\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign out here for\nITProTV, I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n644\n00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:23.970\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n645\n00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.311\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n646\n00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:32.257\n[MUSIC]\n\n647\n00:32:32.257 --> 00:32:35.334\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:05.476 --> 00:00:06.809\nCalifornia [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:08.511\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.511 --> 00:00:12.320\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.600\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.473\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're continuing through our comp\n\n8\n00:00:18.473 --> 00:00:19.945\nTS server plus certification.\n\n9\n00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:23.580\nJoining us in the studios today\nis none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.630\nDon how you doing sir?\n\n11\n00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.050\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing just well Wes, ready to dive\nright back into the world of sever plus.\n\n12\n00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.624\nAnd in this episode we're gonna\nbe talking about bad things.\n\n13\n00:00:30.624 --> 00:00:34.060\nWe're going to be talking about\ndisaster recovery principles and\n\n14\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.630\nsome of the concepts we need to be\nfamiliar with for real life mostly.\n\n15\n00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.110\nBut also for the exam to be prepared to\ndig in there and answer those questions.\n\n16\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.590\nBut, when it comes to disaster recovery,\nthere is a lot to think about and so,\n\n17\n00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.110\nwe need to make sure we have at least\na basic grasp of the general concepts and\n\n18\n00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.390\nprinciples that we know that we're\nat least taking the right actions or\n\n19\n00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.080\naccounting for\nthe right things in our plan.\n\n20\n00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.199\nThe first part which is having a plan.\n\n21\n00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.190\nIf you don't have a plan then you\nkind of have already surrendered.\n\n22\n00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.970\nBut how do you come up with that plan?\n\n23\n00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.060\nWhat else is part of that?\n\n24\n00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.530\nWhat are some of the solutions out there?\n\n25\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.995\nThose are the things we're gonna take\na look at right here in this episode.\n\n26\n00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:12.130\nNow, let's talk about just why we even\nhave to worry about disaster recovery in\n\n27\n00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.360\nthe first place.\n\n28\n00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.910\nThe main thing with disaster recovery\nis that the current solutions\n\n29\n00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.700\nthat companies are creating\nare becoming increasingly complex.\n\n30\n00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.140\nBack in the olden days,\nlet's go into the days of yore,\n\n31\n00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.730\nyou could get a program\nthat was on a floppy disk.\n\n32\n00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.150\nAnd you'd sit down at your computer,\nyou'd pop the floppy disk in, and\n\n33\n00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.610\nyou'd run the program.\n\n34\n00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.580\nAnd if something went wrong on your\ncomputer, you took the floppy disk and\n\n35\n00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.140\nyou went to another computer and you\npopped it in and it worked there, right?\n\n36\n00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.441\nOr if it was the floppy disk that\nwent back, you just went and\n\n37\n00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:45.574\ngot another copy and pop it in and\noff you went, right?\n\n38\n00:01:45.574 --> 00:01:47.950\nSo things were very simple back then.\n\n39\n00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.250\nAnd terms like disaster recovery,\nthey didn't really come into play because\n\n40\n00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.120\nbusinesses weren't completely dependent\non their IT infrastructure back then.\n\n41\n00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.610\nThat computers played a part, but\nthey could still continue to sell and\n\n42\n00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.650\nwhatever it is their company did\neven if the computers were down.\n\n43\n00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.980\nBut in today's world,\nthings are very different.\n\n44\n00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:14.060\nImagine if you went to a department\nstore or a grocery store, right.\n\n45\n00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.250\nSo you get a bunch of groceries,\nyou walk up to the cash register,\n\n46\n00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.600\nand the cash register's down.\n\n47\n00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.746\nWell, they don't have a back up plan.\n\n48\n00:02:21.746 --> 00:02:24.277\nIf the cash register is down,\nyou can't buy stuff then I can say,\n\n49\n00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:26.506\nwell I'll write it down on paper and\ndo you have cash?\n\n50\n00:02:26.506 --> 00:02:29.737\nYeah, we can't do credit cards right now,\nright?\n\n51\n00:02:29.737 --> 00:02:31.960\nPeople don't still carry\ncash like they used to or\n\n52\n00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.120\neven a checkbook for that matter.\n\n53\n00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.960\nSo there's no back up plan there.\n\n54\n00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.160\nThey need their computer infrastructure to\nbe up and running for them to do business.\n\n55\n00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.990\nLook at us, ITPRO TV, right?\n\n56\n00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.500\nWe do video streaming on the internet.\n\n57\n00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.940\nWhat if our network goes down, right?\n\n58\n00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.770\nIf our facilities go down?\n\n59\n00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.670\nWe don't have a backup.\n\n60\n00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.380\nWe're not gonna mail DVDs to everybody,\nright?\n\n61\n00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.090\nOr VHS [LAUGH] tapes or whatever, Betamax.\n\n62\n00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.060\nIt's not gonna happen, right?\n\n63\n00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.230\nSo you've got to have an IT infrastructure\nthat is stable and up and running.\n\n64\n00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.760\nSometimes because you want it, right?\n\n65\n00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.113\nSometimes it's just because you want your\ncustomers to have a good experience.\n\n66\n00:03:02.113 --> 00:03:05.500\nSometimes because you're required, right?\n\n67\n00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.867\nYou might have government\nregulations that you have to meet,\n\n68\n00:03:07.867 --> 00:03:09.013\notherwise you get shut down.\n\n69\n00:03:09.013 --> 00:03:13.519\nI used to work in the banking industry and\nat the bank that I worked for\n\n70\n00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.360\nwe were FDIC insured.\n\n71\n00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.889\nAnd they had a rule, they said if\nyou ever have a computer outage or\n\n72\n00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.739\nsomething that causes your customers\nnot to be able to get their money,\n\n73\n00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.770\nyou have to be back up and\nrunning in 72 hours, right?\n\n74\n00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.607\nSo we had three days, if there was ever\na failure that shut down our systems,\n\n75\n00:03:30.607 --> 00:03:32.690\nwe had three days to fix it.\n\n76\n00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.330\nAnd if we weren't back online in\nthree days, they would come and\n\n77\n00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.470\nseize the bank and\ntake over control, right?\n\n78\n00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.460\nAnd basically take care of the customers,\nthat's what they do,\n\n79\n00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.830\nthat's what FDIC insurance is all about.\n\n80\n00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.915\nSo we had a deadline that\nwasn't really an option for us,\n\n81\n00:03:44.915 --> 00:03:46.538\nwe had to meet that deadline.\n\n82\n00:03:46.538 --> 00:03:48.955\nSo how do you make sure you can do that,\nright?\n\n83\n00:03:48.955 --> 00:03:51.390\nCuz a lot of times, something goes wrong\nwith a computer and you look at it and\n\n84\n00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.370\nyou're like well, something's wrong,\nI wish I knew what it was.\n\n85\n00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.750\nAnd then you start\ntrying to figure it out.\n\n86\n00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.310\nRight well, how long is it gonna\ntake you to figure that out?\n\n87\n00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.008\nWho knows,\nyou don't know what the problem is, right?\n\n88\n00:04:01.008 --> 00:04:02.220\nSo you gotta troubleshoot it.\n\n89\n00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.206\nSome problems might take you 10 minutes.\n\n90\n00:04:03.206 --> 00:04:06.728\nSome problems might take you four hours,\nsome problems might take you weeks\n\n91\n00:04:06.728 --> 00:04:09.165\nof troubleshooting and\nresearching to figure out.\n\n92\n00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.881\nBut if you only got three days,\n\n93\n00:04:10.881 --> 00:04:13.984\nyou've got to solve any problem\nyou have in three days.\n\n94\n00:04:13.984 --> 00:04:16.560\nAnd that's where disaster\nrecovery planning comes in.\n\n95\n00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.607\nIf you have a disaster, and\n\n96\n00:04:18.607 --> 00:04:24.570\nby disaster I mean an event that stops\nyour business from functioning, right?\n\n97\n00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.538\nSo if we have a disaster that stops\nthe business from functioning,\n\n98\n00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:28.333\nhow do I recover?\n\n99\n00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:30.660\nHow do I get back online?\n\n100\n00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.250\nAnd you don't wanna figure that out\nflying by the seat of your pants.\n\n101\n00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.264\nYou want to have this plan\nin place ahead of time.\n\n102\n00:04:37.264 --> 00:04:39.688\nSo you know exactly what you need\nto do to get back online and\n\n103\n00:04:39.688 --> 00:04:41.200\nget things back up and going.\n\n104\n00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.190\nThat's a key concept for\n\n105\n00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.270\nany business that's trying to\ntake care of their customer.\n\n106\n00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.370\n&gt;&gt; And I can only imagine,\nDon, a plan like this,\n\n107\n00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.390\nyou're gonna be able to find out, if you\nhave it in place, you're gonna be able to\n\n108\n00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.720\nfind out things like your crucial systems,\nyour critical systems,\n\n109\n00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.410\nsystems that need to be back on within\nminutes, within hours, versus, maybe\n\n110\n00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.532\nsomething that can wait a week or so,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you've gotta do it, you've\n\n111\n00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:04.141\ngotta classify your systems, classify your\ndata, figure out what is truly important.\n\n112\n00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:07.100\nBecause remember what I\nsaid a disaster is, right?\n\n113\n00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.630\nSomethings that stops\nthe business from functioning.\n\n114\n00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.066\nIf Wes's laptop over here died right now,\nwhich is pretty likely, if it happened,\n\n115\n00:05:14.066 --> 00:05:17.133\nthat's not gonna stop us from\nfilming this show, right?\n\n116\n00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:18.864\nHe's browsing YouTube or whatever so\n\n117\n00:05:18.864 --> 00:05:21.770\nit's not gonna [LAUGH] stop\nus from filming the show.\n\n118\n00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.150\nThat's not a disaster, right?\n\n119\n00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.680\nI mean, it's a failure we had a device\nthat does need to be fixed or\n\n120\n00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.140\nreplaced or whatever.\n\n121\n00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.970\nBut it didn't stop the show.\n\n122\n00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.979\nIf our internet connection goes down,\nwell,\n\n123\n00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.047\nall right that'll stop\nthe stream to you guys.\n\n124\n00:05:34.047 --> 00:05:37.010\nThose of you that are watching it live,\nyou wouldn't see it live.\n\n125\n00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.970\nBut, we'd still film the rest\nof the show and record it.\n\n126\n00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.620\nWe'd just have to post it online,\nyou can watch it recorded later.\n\n127\n00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.820\nBut if the power went out of\nthe building and all the cameras and\n\n128\n00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.170\nlights went off that's a disaster.\n\n129\n00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.390\nNow we can't film the show.\n\n130\n00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.610\nThe show goes offline, right?\n\n131\n00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.900\nSo that will be true disaster.\n\n132\n00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.060\nThat would stop our\nbusiness from functioning.\n\n133\n00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.090\nSo how do we plan around that.\n\n134\n00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.310\nHow do we make sure that\nwe don't have those issues.\n\n135\n00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.550\nAnd there's a few different ways to do it.\n\n136\n00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.630\nNow in this series,\nwe're focusing on servers, servers plus.\n\n137\n00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.030\nWe're not talking about if the lights\ngo out, who cares about the lights.\n\n138\n00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.390\nWe need our servers up and running.\n\n139\n00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.915\nAnd your servers depend on the network.\n\n140\n00:06:11.915 --> 00:06:14.060\nThere's a lot of dependencies in here.\n\n141\n00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.670\nSo I've made a little diagram here\nto show you guys those dependencies.\n\n142\n00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.580\nLet's say that you've got\na web application, right?\n\n143\n00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.790\nThis is far more complicated than\na little program on a floppy disk.\n\n144\n00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.350\nSo I've got a web application\nthat my company uses.\n\n145\n00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.670\nMaybe it's like a document imaging\nsoftware or something like that.\n\n146\n00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.410\nWell, my end users,\nthey just see this one program.\n\n147\n00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.980\nThat's all they see.\n\n148\n00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.860\nBut it is made up of a ton of components\nany which one could have a mistake and\n\n149\n00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.360\ncause a failure, right?\n\n150\n00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.330\nSo the application itself,\nthe application has to get installed.\n\n151\n00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.990\nCould it be installed incorrectly?\n\n152\n00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.770\nAbsolutely, right that is\nwhy we have instructions and\n\n153\n00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.170\npeople who don't read instructions.\n\n154\n00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.850\nSo it's got to be installed and\nconfigured.\n\n155\n00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.250\nOnce it's up and running, it's got\nto be monitored and updated, right?\n\n156\n00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.860\nIf we don't monitor it, there could\nbe a problem we don't know about and\n\n157\n00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.870\nit gets worse and worse and\nworse, and then goes offline.\n\n158\n00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.450\nAnd we need to update it,\npatching for security.\n\n159\n00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.640\nIf somebody compromise it,\nif a hacker gets in or\n\n160\n00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.500\na denial service stack happens,\nnow our application is not working, right?\n\n161\n00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.560\nAnd our people can't function.\n\n162\n00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.369\nThink about that cashier at the grocery\nstore, if they can't scan products and\n\n163\n00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:22.900\ncharge money for it,\nthen you can't make money, right?\n\n164\n00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.890\nAnd that's the kinda thing that\nhappens if we don't do our updates.\n\n165\n00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:27.500\nIf we don't keep our system secure.\n\n166\n00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.900\nSo that's up at the application layer.\n\n167\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.890\nThen, we get into the operating system and\nit's the same thing.\n\n168\n00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.660\nYou've got to install and\nconfigure the OS.\n\n169\n00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.821\nMany mistakes can be made there.\n\n170\n00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:37.280\nYou've got to monitor and update.\n\n171\n00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.809\nAnd if you don't do it,\nthey're all areas where you're exposed.\n\n172\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.531\nAfter that if this is on\npremises equipment, right?\n\n173\n00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:46.215\nLike what you see behind me.\n\n174\n00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:48.163\nHere this server rack back\nhere that's on premises stuff.\n\n175\n00:07:48.163 --> 00:07:51.236\nSo the things that are here\nyou've got your hardware, right?\n\n176\n00:07:51.236 --> 00:07:54.057\nWe've got a warranty that\nneeds to be maintained on it.\n\n177\n00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:58.168\nIf a power supply dies and it's not\nunder warranty I'm gonna have to go and\n\n178\n00:07:58.168 --> 00:08:00.837\nfind an after market power supply and\norder it.\n\n179\n00:08:00.837 --> 00:08:04.530\nIt might take a week or two to get one,\nin the meantime that server's off.\n\n180\n00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.956\nOr if I have redundant power supplies I'm\nrunning in a reduced state until I can get\n\n181\n00:08:07.956 --> 00:08:09.740\nthat other power supply in.\n\n182\n00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.550\nIf it's under warranty though,\n\n183\n00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.540\nmaybe I've got a four hour response\ntime warranty like with a parts depot.\n\n184\n00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.840\nA lot of vendors, Dell,\nHP, they do that, so\n\n185\n00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.600\nyou can get a power supply very,\nvery fast.\n\n186\n00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.750\nMaybe I think we got spares\nthat are just lying around.\n\n187\n00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.300\nI keep some spare powers supply's or spare\nhard drives, they're always hard drives.\n\n188\n00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.200\nSo you can just swap one out right then.\n\n189\n00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.720\nMaybe it's even a hot spare that's all\nready in the server just waiting for\n\n190\n00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.920\na failure,\nwe do that with hard drives all the time.\n\n191\n00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.780\nI might have a rate tenor rate with ten\ndrives and two more drives it's a hot\n\n192\n00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.407\nspares are sitting right there ready\nto take over a moment of notice.\n\n193\n00:08:41.407 --> 00:08:43.599\nRight, that's planning for the failure,\n\n194\n00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:47.224\nsaying hey I can't stop a hard drive\nfrom failing, it's gonna happen.\n\n195\n00:08:47.224 --> 00:08:49.952\nBut when it does,\nI've got the spares ready to go,\n\n196\n00:08:49.952 --> 00:08:51.990\nthey're already in there on the way.\n\n197\n00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.980\nWe also need to monitor and\nupdate firmware\n\n198\n00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.380\non our hardware cuz there's a tax and\nexploits, but there's also bugs and\n\n199\n00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.460\njust general instability that\ncan come from outdated firmware.\n\n200\n00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.400\nAnd then we get into\nthe physical infrastructure and\n\n201\n00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.100\nthis is the hardest part.\n\n202\n00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.030\nOn the physical side,\n\n203\n00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.480\nyou've got your switches and routers,\nyour network infrastructure.\n\n204\n00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.140\nYou've got power and for power,\nwe have uninterruptible power supplies,\n\n205\n00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.370\na battery backups and generators.\n\n206\n00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:24.080\nRemember that battery backups are only\ndesigned to run for a handful of minutes.\n\n207\n00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.680\nFor people that have battery backups that\nrun for hours, their design is wrong.\n\n208\n00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.970\nThat's not the way they're\nintended to be used, right.\n\n209\n00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:35.900\nWhen power goes out, a battery\nbackup is designed to immediately\n\n210\n00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.270\ntake the place of the missing power,\nright.\n\n211\n00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.110\nSo we maintain power even\nwhen the power just went off.\n\n212\n00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:45.590\nAnd as soon as that UPS kicks in,\none of two things needs to happen.\n\n213\n00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.810\nEither one, our servers need to\nstart gracefully shutting down, so\n\n214\n00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.820\nthey can shut down gracefully and\nnot have data corruption.\n\n215\n00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.100\nOr two, our generators can be turning on.\n\n216\n00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.150\nIt takes a while for a generator crank\nup and start generating electricity.\n\n217\n00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.590\nIf the UPS can run for five minutes,\nthat's enough time for\n\n218\n00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.080\nthe generators to start and\nstart providing the electricity that we're\n\n219\n00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.120\nnormally getting from the grid and\ntake over.\n\n220\n00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.010\nThat's how UPS should be\nused in a data center.\n\n221\n00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.490\nWhen you have a UPS sitting under\nyour desk, just for your workstation.\n\n222\n00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.300\nYou might say, hey,\nI can run on this thing for two hours.\n\n223\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.900\nThat's your workstation, that's fine.\n\n224\n00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:25.660\nBut servers draw so much power and routers\nand switches and all those are things that\n\n225\n00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:30.050\ndraw so much power that you can't\nconceivably get them to go for very long.\n\n226\n00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:33.280\nAnd I've seen people where they spend\nhundreds of thousands of dollars\n\n227\n00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.780\nto get these massive battery\narrays that will their servers for\n\n228\n00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:40.190\nhours and I look and them and I say,\nwhy didn't you put a generator in?\n\n229\n00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.360\nA generator can run for days on end and\nwill cost less than that battery, and\n\n230\n00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.750\nthey're easier to maintain.\n\n231\n00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.680\nYou need lower UPSs that\njust keep you running for\n\n232\n00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.400\na few minutes while\nthe generators kick in, right?\n\n233\n00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.330\nBut those are designed\nto replace that power.\n\n234\n00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:53.580\nEither solution cost money,\n\n235\n00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.860\nthough, this all costs a lot of money to\nbe able to provide disaster recovery.\n\n236\n00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.750\nThese are all different\noptions that are out there.\n\n237\n00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.810\nWe also got physical security.\n\n238\n00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:05.640\nIf somebody can get into that server in\nbehind me and start unplugging things.\n\n239\n00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.890\nThat's it, you don't have to be hacker.\n\n240\n00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.420\nYou just have to know\nhow to grab a cable and\n\n241\n00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.810\nyank on it and\nyou can bring a network down.\n\n242\n00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:14.130\nSo we gotta make sure that only\nauthorize personnel gets in there.\n\n243\n00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.530\nAnd heating and cooling, that's\nwhere people are usually vulnerable.\n\n244\n00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.010\nServers have temperature\nranges they can operate in.\n\n245\n00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.900\nThe cooling side is the more important\none, the hotter a server gets\n\n246\n00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.200\neventually it goes into thermal\nshutdown and powers down.\n\n247\n00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.320\nSo if somebody sabotages\nmy air conditioning,\n\n248\n00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.360\nmy servers are gonna shut down.\n\n249\n00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.790\nSo I've gotta make sure that I've got\nadequate cooling in place in order for\n\n250\n00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.770\nmy systems to stay online.\n\n251\n00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:39.195\nAll of these are areas where\nwe can have a failure and\n\n252\n00:11:39.195 --> 00:11:41.870\nany one of these can lead to a disaster.\n\n253\n00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.770\nNow it might happen on\na development server and\n\n254\n00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.090\nI don't care about the dev server so\nit's not a big deal.\n\n255\n00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:49.880\nBut it could happen on a mission critical\nserver and now I've got a problem.\n\n256\n00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:56.460\nOkay, now UPS's, redundant power supplies,\nredundant switches, redundant hard drives,\n\n257\n00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:00.980\nthese are all ways that I can try and\nsurvive individual component failures.\n\n258\n00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:07.120\nBut, disasters can take many forms and\nthey can be really big disasters.\n\n259\n00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.900\nSo, for example, we're in Florida, so\nwhat if a hurricane comes through?\n\n260\n00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.590\nI haven't had one recently but\nthey do come through pretty often.\n\n261\n00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.250\nAnd if a hurricane comes through and\ndestroys this building right here,\n\n262\n00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:23.790\na whole building destroyed, that\ngenerator's not helping me anymore, right?\n\n263\n00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:28.240\nMy UPS's, my redundant hard drives,\nthe locks on the door.\n\n264\n00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.410\nNone of that stuff is gonna matter\nif the building is destroyed.\n\n265\n00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:35.460\nSo these components don't solve the bigger\ndisaster, we need a bigger solution.\n\n266\n00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.850\n&gt;&gt; So what you're saying here Don,\nif I understand this right,\n\n267\n00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.710\nis that from the diagrams point of view,\n\n268\n00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.100\nthese are just the individual\ncomponents within your network.\n\n269\n00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.770\nBut now what you're talking\nabout is the whole entire site.\n\n270\n00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:49.680\nNow we've got a problem cuz not\njust the individual components,\n\n271\n00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.590\nit's everything on premise.\n\n272\n00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:54.180\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and let's take a look\nat that word, everything, right,\n\n273\n00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.320\neverything's a big word.\n\n274\n00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.650\nWe're talking about equipment,\n\n275\n00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:01.650\nwe're talking about a network,\nwe're also talking about people, right?\n\n276\n00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:03.090\nI use the example of\nthe bank that I worked for,\n\n277\n00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.590\nour headquarters was in\na skyscraper in downtown Seattle.\n\n278\n00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.720\nSo, what if there was an earthquake and\nthat building went down?\n\n279\n00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.290\nThe whole IT department\nwas in that building,\n\n280\n00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:17.690\nthere were a couple of field personnel out\nthere but the bulk, the entire dev team.\n\n281\n00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:21.370\nThe network team that I was a part of,\nthe sys admin team, the help desk,\n\n282\n00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.700\neverybody was just right\nthere in that one building.\n\n283\n00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:28.040\nIf you lose all that staff, who's\ngonna bring your systems back online?\n\n284\n00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.800\nWho's gonna keep the business running?\n\n285\n00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.580\nWe had 110 branches across 4 states,\n\n286\n00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.440\nmost of those branches wouldn't have\neven been affected by the earthquake.\n\n287\n00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.370\nBut now they can't do business because\nthe headquarters is gone, right?\n\n288\n00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.600\nSo we've got to have a plan in place for\nthat.\n\n289\n00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.050\nNot just for the servers but for\neverything, every component.\n\n290\n00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:49.504\nAnd the real secret sauce of disaster\nrecovery, you guys are gonna hate this,\n\n291\n00:13:49.504 --> 00:13:53.550\nit's documentation,\nhaving everything documented.\n\n292\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.420\nThe more thoroughly documented,\nthe better off you're gonna be.\n\n293\n00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:59.180\nLet's say you lose the IT department,\n\n294\n00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.980\nyou lose the personnel,\ncontractors need to be able to come in,\n\n295\n00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.460\nnew personnel need to be able to come\nin and learn your system very quickly.\n\n296\n00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.740\nAnd they can do that with documentation.\n\n297\n00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.250\nOr, let's assume it's not a personnel\ncrisis, let's just say it's the building.\n\n298\n00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.200\nThe building goes offline.\n\n299\n00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.900\nWe need to be able to fail-over,\nsome other solution and\n\n300\n00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.850\nwe need to have the steps documented for\ntwo reasons, right.\n\n301\n00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.370\nOne so we know what to do,\ncuz that's kind of important.\n\n302\n00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.380\nAnd then two because that will let\nus know how long it will take.\n\n303\n00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.400\nThe moment you have an outage,\nwhat's gonna happen?\n\n304\n00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.320\nYour phone's gonna ring.\n\n305\n00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.550\nYou're gonna answer it and\nit's gonna be the CEO and\n\n306\n00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.759\nthey're gonna say how long\nuntil you get us back online?\n\n307\n00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.230\nThe answer you don't wanna give is,\nI don't know.\n\n308\n00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:39.040\nThe answer you do wanna give is, well the\nlast time we did the DR test that took us\n\n309\n00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.340\n2 hours and 35 minutes to fail over, so\nthat's what we're targeting for right now.\n\n310\n00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.320\nThat's what you wanna say, right?\n\n311\n00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.500\nHow do you get there?\n\n312\n00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.601\nDocumentation and testing.\n\n313\n00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:52.383\nYou need to come up with a plan and have\nrun through the plan a few times,, right.\n\n314\n00:14:52.383 --> 00:14:57.039\nNow if you're planning for\na big disaster, a building disaster, then\n\n315\n00:14:57.039 --> 00:15:02.179\nthe best solution to a building disaster\nis to have a second building, right?\n\n316\n00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:04.920\nIf your main building is gone,\nyour main data center is gone,\n\n317\n00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.934\nhaving another data center somewhere else.\n\n318\n00:15:06.934 --> 00:15:10.695\nAnd if you're a big enterprise,\nyou probably already have one, right,\n\n319\n00:15:10.695 --> 00:15:12.720\nmaybe two or three, right.\n\n320\n00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.000\nIf you are a small or medium business, you\nmight be laughing at me right now saying,\n\n321\n00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.973\nyeah, I'm going to set up a whole\nsecond company, I'm gonna do that.\n\n322\n00:15:18.973 --> 00:15:20.480\nIt's expensive, but\n\n323\n00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.750\nthere's solutions out there that\nmake that cost almost negligible.\n\n324\n00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.380\nRight, and it depends on what kind\nof alternate site we want to set up.\n\n325\n00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:33.040\nRight, so on the exam,\nthey call out hot sites and cold sites.\n\n326\n00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.090\nA hot site is the expensive one,\n\n327\n00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.190\nthat's the one that a big\nenterprise is gonna do it.\n\n328\n00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:43.180\nIt costs a lot of money, which says,\nI have 200 servers in my data center here.\n\n329\n00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.833\nI'm gonna build another data\ncenter somewhere else and\n\n330\n00:15:45.833 --> 00:15:49.282\nI'm gonna have 200 servers there,\nan exact mirror between the two.\n\n331\n00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:53.901\nSo everything in production in my main\nlocation is in my disaster recovery\n\n332\n00:15:53.901 --> 00:15:55.913\ncenter, my DR center, right.\n\n333\n00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:58.033\nThat means every time I buy\na server I have to buy two servers,\n\n334\n00:15:58.033 --> 00:15:59.490\nall my costs just doubled.\n\n335\n00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.314\nThat's a lot of money.\n\n336\n00:16:00.314 --> 00:16:01.330\nIt does cost a lot of money.\n\n337\n00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.720\nBut at the same time, all those\nservers are up and running over there.\n\n338\n00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.102\nAnd if my main site were to fail,\nyou just jump over to the other side.\n\n339\n00:16:09.102 --> 00:16:10.467\nDone.\nYou're back up and\n\n340\n00:16:10.467 --> 00:16:12.610\nrunning immediately, right.\n\n341\n00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:16.930\nDuring the September 11th attacks when\nthe New York Stock Exchange went down,\n\n342\n00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.580\nthey failed over from\nNew York to New Jersey.\n\n343\n00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.810\nTo their alternate data center.\n\n344\n00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:22.660\nTheir downtime was three seconds.\n\n345\n00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.780\nThree whole seconds,\nthat was their downtime.\n\n346\n00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.520\nEntire building destroyed, right?\n\n347\n00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.720\nAfter that, they did shut down for\n\n348\n00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.850\na few days because they wanted to,\nnot because they had to.\n\n349\n00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.480\nBecause they felt that was\nthe right thing to do.\n\n350\n00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.680\nBut their downtime was three seconds.\n\n351\n00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.920\nAnd that's what you can achieve\nwhen you have a hot site.\n\n352\n00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.720\nIt's just ready to go,\nand you flip a switch.\n\n353\n00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.890\nIt's usually automatic, right?\n\n354\n00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.240\nAs soon as it sees the main site gone,\n\n355\n00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.970\nthe other site just takes over,\nand that's that.\n\n356\n00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.440\nProblem with a hot site, it's expensive.\n\n357\n00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.820\nSo, if you're a small, or\na medium business, instead of a hot site,\n\n358\n00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:50.490\nyou can do a cold site.\n\n359\n00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.620\nWhat's a cold site?\n\n360\n00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:57.080\nWell, if I have 200 servers Now I want to\nbe able to failover to another location,\n\n361\n00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.010\nbut I don't want to pay for\n200 servers over there.\n\n362\n00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:03.410\nWhat you can do is you can contract\nwith a hosting provider to not\n\n363\n00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.110\nhave equipment set up for you already,\nbut to hold your backup tapes.\n\n364\n00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:11.530\nJust to hold all your\nbackups right there off site.\n\n365\n00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:16.930\nAnd then when a failure happens,\nthen you can buy a bunch of servers and\n\n366\n00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:18.810\nrestore your backups and\nbring it back online.\n\n367\n00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:22.130\nYour backup's already there, but\nthe servers aren't up and running.\n\n368\n00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:23.450\nYou've gotta buy them and get them there.\n\n369\n00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.100\nNow, I know what you're thinking.\n\n370\n00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.330\nIt's gonna take days, maybe even weeks,\nto buy servers and get them in in time.\n\n371\n00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.920\nAnd that's where cloud solutions come in.\n\n372\n00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.830\nIf you use Microsoft Azure or Amazon AWS,\n\n373\n00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:37.610\nyou can replicate all your data up to\nthem and not have servers running.\n\n374\n00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:39.520\nSo you're just paying for\ndata storage, which is really cheap.\n\n375\n00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.170\nAnd then the moment you have a failure,\n\n376\n00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.110\nyou can spin up virtual machines\nup in the cloud environment.\n\n377\n00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.830\nYou can spin up 200 VMs and\nnow you're back up and\n\n378\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.470\nrunning in a very short amount of time.\n\n379\n00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:54.230\nSo if you can't afford the hotsite\nsolution, you can do the cold site,\n\n380\n00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.910\nleveraging a cloud solution, right?\n\n381\n00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:57.310\nAnd that works really well.\n\n382\n00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.850\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don, with the hot site and\nthe cold site here,\n\n383\n00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:03.730\nmaintenance wise it seems almost like the\nhot site requires you to have two staff.\n\n384\n00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.910\nOr a duplicate staff.\n\n385\n00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:06.680\nStaffing as well.\n\n386\n00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.500\nSo it seems like that you, you know,\n\n387\n00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.810\nyou're gonna have about the same amount\nof like IT employees on that hot site.\n\n388\n00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:13.910\nHow about the cold site?\n\n389\n00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:16.740\nIs it gonna be hard to maintain that or\n\n390\n00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.870\nis it just literally\nmoving that to the cloud?\n\n391\n00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.870\n&gt;&gt; You know, you don't normally\nhave a separate set of employees,\n\n392\n00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:22.709\neven at a hot site.\n\n393\n00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:28.330\nSo for example, the last one that I\nsetup at the disaster recovery site,\n\n394\n00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:32.640\nwe had active servers that were running\nin DR that we just remotely managed.\n\n395\n00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.970\nBecause they were all synchronizing\noff a production anyway.\n\n396\n00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:37.800\nYou update a production server,\nit synched that over and\n\n397\n00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.300\nupdated the DR site server too.\n\n398\n00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.700\nSo they stayed in lockstep.\n\n399\n00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.330\nSo the only time we need employees over\nthere were if we had loss of life.\n\n400\n00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.540\nAnd loss of life don't really\nhappen all that often.\n\n401\n00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.940\nSo in those scenarios,\n\n402\n00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.740\nwe just had a standing contract with an IT\ncompany that was out in the town where\n\n403\n00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.080\nthe DR site was that they had\nemployees they could jump in.\n\n404\n00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.760\nThey are actually part of the hosting\nprovider that run that data center.\n\n405\n00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.470\nSo that they could jump in and\ntake over and\n\n406\n00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.039\nthey had all our run books\nthat had the step by steps,\n\n407\n00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:04.150\nhow you manage the servers and\nhow you do all the operations that we did.\n\n408\n00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:05.670\nAll that documentation, right?\n\n409\n00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.410\nSo we didn't have to have a second staff.\n\n410\n00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:11.870\nIn a cold site, you need people who\nare prepared to do the recovery.\n\n411\n00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:13.810\nAnd that get's to be a little challenging.\n\n412\n00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:18.540\nAnd that's where solutions like,\nlet me bring up Azure site recovery.\n\n413\n00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.470\nMicrosoft has a product called Azure site\nrecovery and it works for Windows and\n\n414\n00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.230\nLinux, so it's not just a Windows thing.\n\n415\n00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.600\nBut what it does is it backs up\nyour on premises servers and\n\n416\n00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.970\nit backs them up to Azure.\n\n417\n00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:32.690\nAnd it already treats them\nlike virtual machines and so\n\n418\n00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.840\nthey're ready to be turned\non in a moment's notice.\n\n419\n00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.060\nSo this backup is constantly running.\n\n420\n00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.440\nAnd the moment you have a failure,\nyou hit a button and\n\n421\n00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.830\nall these VMs spin up that already\nhave your data that's already current.\n\n422\n00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.190\nAnd now you're running in the cloud.\n\n423\n00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:49.280\nSo this is a cold site that can\nbe spun up very inexpensively and\n\n424\n00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.290\nvery quickly and you don't require\na separate set of staff to do it.\n\n425\n00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.140\nIt's all already set up and\nmaintained by their staff.\n\n426\n00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.210\nSo these solutions are out there,\n\n427\n00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.220\nit's just a matter of picking\nthe one that's right for you.\n\n428\n00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:00.850\n&gt;&gt; You know you mention another concept,\nDon.\n\n429\n00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.820\nYou talked about if\nyou've got the hot site.\n\n430\n00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.570\nYou say make your change on one server,\n\n431\n00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.610\nreplicates right away\nover to the other server.\n\n432\n00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:09.210\nCan you talk a little bit more about\nthat replication part of that?\n\n433\n00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.290\nHow would we see that?\n\n434\n00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:13.760\n&gt;&gt; All right, so when we replicate\nbetween servers, there's a few ways,\n\n435\n00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.770\nthere's third party software, there's\ntons of software they can replicate.\n\n436\n00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.060\nThere's things like R Sync in\nthe Unix world that you can use to\n\n437\n00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:20.940\nsynchronize data.\n\n438\n00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:25.620\nIf you have databases like MariaDB,\nMySQL, Microsoft SQL or Oracle,\n\n439\n00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.340\nthey all have replication technologies.\n\n440\n00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.400\nSo it really varies on the application\nthat you're replicating.\n\n441\n00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:34.170\nIf you have a SAN, like EMC SANs they have\na product called replistore that can run\n\n442\n00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.100\ninside of them that can replicate\nthe entire stinking SAN.\n\n443\n00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.930\nSo everything on the SAN is getting\nreplicated in real time over to\n\n444\n00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:40.450\nthe other side.\n\n445\n00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:46.930\nYou can do scuzzy, it's a fiber\nchannel over ethernet, SCOE, so you\n\n446\n00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:50.820\ncan replicate the fiber channel traffic\non the SAN to an entire other location.\n\n447\n00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.990\nIt does depend on your hardware,\nwhat features are there, so\n\n448\n00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.960\nyou've got to look at your\nvendor documentation.\n\n449\n00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.280\nSome of it goes disk to disk\nlike the SAN replication.\n\n450\n00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:03.270\nIt's kind of like a RAID1\nmirror on steroids.\n\n451\n00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.200\nYou can do server to server,\nwhich is what you normally have or\n\n452\n00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.230\nif the application is doing the\nreplication, and you can do site to site,\n\n453\n00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.610\nwhere you're replicating\nbetween the sites.\n\n454\n00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:15.698\nRemember that when you replicate inside an\nenvironment, like I replicate between two\n\n455\n00:21:15.698 --> 00:21:19.674\nhard drives, a RAID1 mirror that provides\nredundancy if the hard drive fails, but\n\n456\n00:21:19.674 --> 00:21:21.980\nnot redundancy if the server fails.\n\n457\n00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.040\nAnd if I replicate from server\nto server in the same rack,\n\n458\n00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.840\nthat protects me if a server fails but\nnot of the whole rack fails,\n\n459\n00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.480\nlike the rack which goes or\npower goes out.\n\n460\n00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:36.180\nAnd then if I'm replicating site to site,\nthat protects me if an entire site fails.\n\n461\n00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.160\nSo that's kind of the three\ndifferent models that we have, and\n\n462\n00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.190\nit all comes down to how much\ndowntime you can afford.\n\n463\n00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:42.610\nYou might not care if your site goes down.\n\n464\n00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.950\nLike ITPROTV.\n\n465\n00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:50.870\nThe reality is if this entire building\nshut down, our website, all our videos,\n\n466\n00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:54.230\nall our membership login, all of\nthat stuff, that's on cloud servers.\n\n467\n00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.790\nThat's not dependent on this site.\n\n468\n00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:58.030\nThe only thing dependent\non this site is live video.\n\n469\n00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.320\nSo if this building were to fail,\n\n470\n00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.820\nwe just wouldn't be able to do\nthe live video for a little while.\n\n471\n00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.110\nThat's not that big of a deal.\n\n472\n00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.590\nSo we don't need a crazy setup\nof redundancy to maintain,\n\n473\n00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:10.580\ncuz everything else is fully\nredundant out in the cloud, right?\n\n474\n00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:14.590\nYou've gotta pick and choose what's\nimportant, what needs to be replicated.\n\n475\n00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:18.300\nWe could easily run all of our web\nservices out of this rack behind me here.\n\n476\n00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.870\nBut then we would have to worry\nabout this building going down.\n\n477\n00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:25.230\nBut by putting it in a cloud I can\nget redundancy and geolocation.\n\n478\n00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.420\nWe can put web servers in the countries\nwhere we have the most viewers.\n\n479\n00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.710\nWe have a lot of viewers in Australia,\nstick a server in Australia.\n\n480\n00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:33.810\nThat wouldn't happen if those\nservers were right here behind me.\n\n481\n00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.860\nSo these are choices that you have\nto make when you setup replication.\n\n482\n00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.100\nAnd there's other choices.\n\n483\n00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.080\nLike I mentioned hot and\ncold sites, there's warm sites.\n\n484\n00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.000\nWarm sites are in between, right?\n\n485\n00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.670\nIn between where we have\na lot of cold servers\n\n486\n00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:48.380\nthat are just waiting to be\nbrought up if we need them.\n\n487\n00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.640\nBut some are hot, they're already up.\n\n488\n00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.490\nAnd so what you typically do is you\nhave to evaluate your environment and\n\n489\n00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.120\nfigure out what is truly critical.\n\n490\n00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.480\nAnd the best way to do that is to do\nwhat's called a business impact analysis,\n\n491\n00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.240\nor a BIA, that's where you look at\nall of your systems and you say okay,\n\n492\n00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.600\nif this system went down,\nhow would that impact my business.\n\n493\n00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.870\nSo if the email server went down,\nwhat would happen.\n\n494\n00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:13.580\nWell, for us,\nwe do customer support through email.\n\n495\n00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.770\nSo, customer support would be affected.\n\n496\n00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.270\nBut, that's it.\n\n497\n00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.320\nWe don't do financial transactions or\nanything like that through email.\n\n498\n00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.485\nSo, it's really would just be customer\nsupport which we could do by phone or\n\n499\n00:23:22.485 --> 00:23:23.084\nvia web chat.\n\n500\n00:23:23.084 --> 00:23:25.004\nSo we've got alternate\nmethods we can put in place,\n\n501\n00:23:25.004 --> 00:23:26.890\nthen email address outage\nwouldn't be bad for us.\n\n502\n00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.850\nBut if our network went down or if our\npower went down we couldn't do live video\n\n503\n00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:33.640\nand that would be annoying so\nwe need backup.\n\n504\n00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.530\nSo we have multiple ISPs and\n\n505\n00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:38.100\nstuff like that to give that\nredundancy and put it in place.\n\n506\n00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.570\nA business impact analysis is designed\nto help you identify what's critical,\n\n507\n00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.510\nwhat systems are really important and\n\n508\n00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:46.340\nhow much money they would\ncost you if they were down.\n\n509\n00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.510\nAnd while you might not necessarily care\nabout that, your CIO and your CEO do.\n\n510\n00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:53.730\nBecause every redundancy you\nput in place costs money.\n\n511\n00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:57.012\nAnd they need to know that there\nis a cost to benefit ratio, right.\n\n512\n00:23:57.012 --> 00:24:04.938\nThat if I spend $100,000 now It's saving\nme a million dollars during an outage.\n\n513\n00:24:04.938 --> 00:24:06.180\nThat's a 10 to one return.\n\n514\n00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.490\nThat's good.\n\n515\n00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:12.450\nVersus I can spend a $100,000 now to save\nme from what would be a $2,000 outage.\n\n516\n00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.640\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\n517\n00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.180\nSo BIA helps you to figure that out.\n\n518\n00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:20.320\nWhat would it cost my company in terms\nof man hours and wasted revenue,\n\n519\n00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.370\nwasted effort for this system to be down.\n\n520\n00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:26.990\nAnd then, you might take what's\ncritical and make those hot.\n\n521\n00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:30.130\nAnd then anything that's non critical and\nmake those cold.\n\n522\n00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:32.270\nAnd that way, you get a hybrid and\nthat saves you money too.\n\n523\n00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.750\nSo that's another option out there.\n\n524\n00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:38.050\nSo, the BIA,\nit's looking at who is gonna be impacted.\n\n525\n00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:41.090\nOne or two employees or\nall of your employees.\n\n526\n00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:42.630\nWho is it that's gonna be impacted.\n\n527\n00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.220\nAre the customers impacted.\n\n528\n00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.360\nOr just your employees.\n\n529\n00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.450\nCuz that's another kind\nof decision factor.\n\n530\n00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:51.890\nIt looks at what systems are affected,\nand lastly, the severity of that impact.\n\n531\n00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.380\nCuz it might not be very severe.\n\n532\n00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.100\nWe might not care.\n\n533\n00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.550\nWe usually measure severity\nin terms of money.\n\n534\n00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:58.800\nHow much is it gonna\ncost us if this goes out.\n\n535\n00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.814\nWe don't think about severity as\nin like was it a big exposure or\n\n536\n00:25:02.814 --> 00:25:03.670\na little exposure.\n\n537\n00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:04.300\nWho cares.\n\n538\n00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.640\nIt's just, was there loss of life.\n\n539\n00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.360\nHow much money are we\nlosing by being down.\n\n540\n00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.490\nThose are the things we think about,\nand a BIA will help you find that.\n\n541\n00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:17.730\nOnce you've got that, then you can create\nyour business resumption plan, your BRP.\n\n542\n00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.510\nA BRP says business has stopped.\n\n543\n00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:23.670\nSomething happened that stopped business.\n\n544\n00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:26.410\nHow do I resume business.\n\n545\n00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:31.080\nAnd how you resume is gonna vary\nbased on what the outage was.\n\n546\n00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.010\nEmail server went down.\n\n547\n00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.490\nOkay, well I just need to resume\nbusiness as far as email's concerned.\n\n548\n00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:36.260\nMaybe I got some contingency.\n\n549\n00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.730\nAn entire building was destroyed.\n\n550\n00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:41.750\nNow I gotta do something completely\ndifferent than just an email server.\n\n551\n00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.670\nSo you'll have multiple resumption\nprocesses inside of one BRP.\n\n552\n00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.100\nBut you've gotta draw that up and\nget it in place.\n\n553\n00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.870\nI'm calling it a business resumption plan.\n\n554\n00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.380\nSome people refer to it as a business\ncontinuity plan, or a BCP.\n\n555\n00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:57.070\nThey're actually two different\nthings Business resumption\n\n556\n00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:59.530\nis assuming a total disaster.\n\n557\n00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.410\nBusiness continuity is saying\n\n558\n00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:07.210\nwe need to continue doing business even\nthough we've got this outage in place.\n\n559\n00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:11.050\nSo the difference,\nthe true difference between them is\n\n560\n00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:15.400\nbusiness resumption is all\nabout getting us back to 100%.\n\n561\n00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.750\nBusiness continuity is saying, we don't\nhave to be at 100%, we can be at 50%.\n\n562\n00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:22.740\nBut as long as we can still do business\nas long as we continue doing business,\n\n563\n00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.880\neven though we haven't\nfixed our problem yet.\n\n564\n00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.930\nSo some people treat them as the same,\nsome people separate them out.\n\n565\n00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:29.920\nThe bigger your company, the more\nlikely you are to separate them out.\n\n566\n00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.860\nSo you have business continuity, and\nbusiness resumption as separate things.\n\n567\n00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:37.320\nBut basically you need to have these\nplans so that you can test them.\n\n568\n00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.140\nYou can run through them routinely\nto make sure they work and\n\n569\n00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.650\nyou know how long they take.\n\n570\n00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:43.820\nSo now when a failure happens,\nyou're not panicked and\n\n571\n00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.300\ntrying to figure things out,\nyou go and grab your plan.\n\n572\n00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.300\nYou're like, okay, we got a problem.\n\n573\n00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.820\nStep one I need to format this server.\n\n574\n00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:54.140\nStep two, I need to go to this safe and\nget this software and\n\n575\n00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:54.930\ninstall the software.\n\n576\n00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:58.290\nStep three, during the installation,\nthese are the options I need to check.\n\n577\n00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:02.560\nStep four, I need to go get tape\nnumber 712 and pop that in and\n\n578\n00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.610\nrestore these files.\n\n579\n00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:06.410\nStep five, step by step here's what I do.\n\n580\n00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:09.500\nAnd if you've tested it,\nyou can put how long each step takes.\n\n581\n00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.750\nAnd so when the CIO calls, or the CEO, or\nthe people are breathing down your neck,\n\n582\n00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:14.030\nand they say, how long's it gonna be.\n\n583\n00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:17.720\nYou can say, last time we ran through\nthe test, it took X amount of time.\n\n584\n00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.150\nI'm expecting it to be the same.\n\n585\n00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:20.470\nAnd then you run through that process.\n\n586\n00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:22.270\nIt makes things so\nmuch more orderly, and so\n\n587\n00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:27.170\nmuch more, I almost want to say pleasant,\nbut it's never pleasant.\n\n588\n00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:28.630\nIt's just a lot less stressful,\n\n589\n00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.950\neven when you're in that situation\nto have that documentation.\n\n590\n00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:34.120\n&gt;&gt; Don you've mentioned those two plans\nin an organization might be separated,\n\n591\n00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.310\nbusiness resumption and\nbusiness continuity.\n\n592\n00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:39.490\nIn the overall scheme\nof disaster recovery,\n\n593\n00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:42.110\nwould all of these that you've been\ntalking about, these components and\n\n594\n00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:46.900\nthese plans, be lumped under one\ntotal disaster recovery plan.\n\n595\n00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.490\nAre these individual components that\nfall under that umbrella term, or\n\n596\n00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:52.700\nis that its own separate entity as well.\n\n597\n00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.060\n&gt;&gt; It really does get grouped\nunder that disaster recovery plan.\n\n598\n00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.380\nSo business continuity,\n\n599\n00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.890\nbusiness resumption kind of\ngo under disaster recovery.\n\n600\n00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.630\nAnd some people even group that together\nunder continuity of operations.\n\n601\n00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.730\nSo they just call it that as a big name.\n\n602\n00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:08.500\nThe name doesn't really matter,\nit's what the documents do,\n\n603\n00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.150\nwhat service they provide\nbecause it's your safety net.\n\n604\n00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:15.730\nIt's saying when things really go bad,\ninstead of printing my resume,\n\n605\n00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:17.890\nI can print this document and\n\n606\n00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:20.920\nI can follow the steps and\nthen we can get everything back in order.\n\n607\n00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.350\nIt shows you've done your homework.\n\n608\n00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.365\nAnd if I ever go work somewhere.\n\n609\n00:28:24.365 --> 00:28:26.075\nDay one, day two.\n\n610\n00:28:26.075 --> 00:28:29.855\nReading the business resumption plans is\na great way for me to learn the network.\n\n611\n00:28:29.855 --> 00:28:33.365\nBecause now I can learn what's critical,\nwhat system's intertwined.\n\n612\n00:28:33.365 --> 00:28:35.695\nWhich one's worked together and\nhow they connect and all that.\n\n613\n00:28:35.695 --> 00:28:36.755\nIt's all right there in the plan.\n\n614\n00:28:36.755 --> 00:28:40.360\nAnd if I go work somewhere they\ndon't have a plan, I'm like, crap,\n\n615\n00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.740\nthese guys don't know their own network.\n\n616\n00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.240\nThey might have papers,\nbut what does that mean.\n\n617\n00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.870\nSo now I've got to figure things out and\nI've got to create that plan and\n\n618\n00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:48.450\nget it in place.\n\n619\n00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.100\nYou definitely will need to do that.\n\n620\n00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:54.260\nSo, those are some of the concepts and\nprinciples that we need to be aware of.\n\n621\n00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.550\nObviously, there's way\nmore to it than that.\n\n622\n00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:01.000\nAs a sys admin, you should know,\nwhether you have a BRP or BCP.\n\n623\n00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.180\nYou should know whether your\ncompany is following those.\n\n624\n00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.910\nAnd more importantly,\nanytime you make a change to a server,\n\n625\n00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:11.700\nyou should know that you need to go and\nupdate the BRP or BCP to reflect that.\n\n626\n00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.000\nI might have a server which is\na Window Server 2008 today,\n\n627\n00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.170\nand then next week it's\nWindow Server 2012.\n\n628\n00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:21.080\nSo now the BRP needs to be\nupdated to reflect, hey,\n\n629\n00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:25.020\nwhen I restore that server, I need to\ninstall Windows Server 2012, not 2008.\n\n630\n00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.640\nIf I don't update the BRP and we fail\nover, now I'm going to put 2008 in there,\n\n631\n00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.580\nand it might break things,and\nyou've got a problem.\n\n632\n00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.050\nSo you've got to keep it updated.\n\n633\n00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:36.800\nTest it every six months or however often\nto make sure everything's the same.\n\n634\n00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.310\nAnd that it's working the way you expect.\n\n635\n00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.962\nSo that when a failure does happen,\nyou're prepared.\n\n636\n00:29:39.962 --> 00:29:43.750\n&gt;&gt; Boy Don, I can tell you I think the one\nthing that we've definitely learned in\n\n637\n00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.890\nthis episode is documentation and\ndocumentation.\n\n638\n00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:50.330\nNow, speaking of this episode it does look\nlike we're coming to the end of another\n\n639\n00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:50.920\ngreat episode.\n\n640\n00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.580\nBut before we do,\n\n641\n00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.840\ndo you have any additional advice\nyou'd like to give our audience.\n\n642\n00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:58.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you don't have a plan at all,\nit's a really daunting task.\n\n643\n00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.320\nDon't be ashamed to call in contractors.\n\n644\n00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.980\nThere's a lot of contractors and\nauditors out there that can come in and\n\n645\n00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.880\nhelp you create that and\nget it and put it in place.\n\n646\n00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.790\nAnd then after that, you just go into\nmaintenance mode, you maintain the plan.\n\n647\n00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:10.110\nBut it is important,\nyou do need to get it done.\n\n648\n00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.075\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell we appreciate your wisdom on this.\n\n649\n00:30:12.075 --> 00:30:15.465\nI know that you've been in disaster\nrecovery situations before.\n\n650\n00:30:15.465 --> 00:30:16.915\nWe do appreciate you, the viewer.\n\n651\n00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:18.955\nLooks like we're gonna\nwrap this one up here.\n\n652\n00:30:18.955 --> 00:30:21.755\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n653\n00:30:21.755 --> 00:30:22.395\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pizet.\n\n654\n00:30:22.395 --> 00:30:22.960\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n655\n00:30:22.960 -->

welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.388 --> 00:00:18.076\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\nin today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:22.049\nwe are continuing through our\nseries in CompTIA Server+ SK0-004.\n\n9\n00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:25.105\nAnd joining us in the studio for\nthis very endeavour is none other than Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:25.105 --> 00:00:25.609\nDon Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:26.716\nDon, how are you doing, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:26.716 --> 00:00:27.686\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well, Wes.\n\n13\n00:00:27.686 --> 00:00:30.722\nReady to dive into the world of backups,\nright?\n\n14\n00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:33.120\nWe're continuing our Server+ adventure and\n\n15\n00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.304\ntalking about a very important topic that\nreally focuses around making sure that\n\n16\n00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:40.335\nwe're able to recover from\na failure on a server, right?\n\n17\n00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:42.647\nServer fails, we lose data.\n\n18\n00:00:42.647 --> 00:00:44.658\nSometimes it's hardware,\nsometimes it's software, right?\n\n19\n00:00:44.658 --> 00:00:47.251\nIn terms of hardware, it's easy.\n\n20\n00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:50.970\nHard drives fail, they do,\nwe count on it, we know its gonna happen.\n\n21\n00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.262\nYou're lucky to get three years out of\nmost hard drives, if you go beyond that,\n\n22\n00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:55.452\nokay count your blessings.\n\n23\n00:00:55.452 --> 00:00:58.853\nBut it's gonna fail one day, and\nyou need to be able to recover your data.\n\n24\n00:00:58.853 --> 00:01:02.010\nOn the software side,\nusers delete stuff by accident,\n\n25\n00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.965\nhackers delete stuff on purpose.\n\n26\n00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:07.331\nThere's all sorts of things that can\nhappen as far as data corruption.\n\n27\n00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:10.507\nAnd now need to be able\nto recover our data, and\n\n28\n00:01:10.507 --> 00:01:13.560\nthe way we do that is\nby leveraging backups.\n\n29\n00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.840\nNow there are many different ways to do\nbackups, and you've gotta make sure that\n\n30\n00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.278\nyou're choosing the correct ones for\nyour environment.\n\n31\n00:01:20.278 --> 00:01:21.510\nAnd so CompTIA, they call out,\n\n32\n00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.910\nI don't know probably eight different\ntypes of backups here in the objectives.\n\n33\n00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.330\nAnd we need to make sure we understand\nwhat the difference is between all eight.\n\n34\n00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.040\nAnd when one is appropriate\nversus another.\n\n35\n00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.564\nSo let's start with the most simple one,\nwhich is a full backup.\n\n36\n00:01:34.564 --> 00:01:38.756\nA full backup,\nis where we backup everything, right?\n\n37\n00:01:38.756 --> 00:01:43.158\nWe have a selection of data,\nthat we wanna backup,and we backup\n\n38\n00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:47.230\nthe whole thing whether\nfile has changed or not.\n\n39\n00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.800\nIf a have a 100 gig collection of data,\nso a 100 gigabytes of data.\n\n40\n00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.375\nAnd I run a backup every night at\nmidnight then every night at midnight,\n\n41\n00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:58.300\nI'm backing up 100 gigabytes of data.\n\n42\n00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.001\nAnd 100 gigs is not really all that much,\nso that's a perfectly reasonable scenario.\n\n43\n00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:04.978\nBut what if I have 100 terabytes of data?\n\n44\n00:02:04.978 --> 00:02:08.972\nIf I'm backing up 100 terabytes\nof data and I start at midnight,\n\n45\n00:02:08.972 --> 00:02:10.522\nwhen's it gonna finish?\n\n46\n00:02:10.522 --> 00:02:12.060\nIt depends on the media that I'm using.\n\n47\n00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.187\nIf I'm backing up to serialized tape that\ncould take more than a day to back up.\n\n48\n00:02:19.187 --> 00:02:23.248\nWell that means my first back up is still\nrunning by the time my second back up\n\n49\n00:02:23.248 --> 00:02:23.771\nstarts.\n\n50\n00:02:23.771 --> 00:02:27.106\nCan't run two backups at once,\nit's not a reasonable model.\n\n51\n00:02:27.106 --> 00:02:30.922\nSo I need something a little better\nwhen I'm handling large volumes of data.\n\n52\n00:02:30.922 --> 00:02:33.251\nAnd so that's one of the decisions\nthat we have to make.\n\n53\n00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:38.122\nWhen you do a backup, we have to pick and\nchoose what we backup.\n\n54\n00:02:38.122 --> 00:02:39.050\nAnd so in Comp TIA,\n\n55\n00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.311\nthey call out things like selective\nbackups versus a full backup.\n\n56\n00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:47.350\nWhen we say a full backup, the terminology\ngets a little bit weird, right?\n\n57\n00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.355\nIf I have a failure on a server and\nI need to do a restore,\n\n58\n00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:56.682\nthe type of restore I do is gonna depend\nupon the type of backup that I did.\n\n59\n00:02:56.682 --> 00:02:59.620\nAnd just saying a full backup\nisn't actually enough.\n\n60\n00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.100\nYou can do what's called a bare\nmetal backup or a selected backup.\n\n61\n00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.975\nA bare metal backup is where I backup\nevery single file on the hard drives for\n\n62\n00:03:09.975 --> 00:03:11.100\nthat server.\n\n63\n00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.099\nFollowing the idea that someone was to\ngive me a brand new server that was just\n\n64\n00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.426\nthe hardware with no operating system on\nthe hard drive completely blank drives.\n\n65\n00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:23.540\nI could restore everything from backup\nbecause I backed up everything.\n\n66\n00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.217\nSo I could restore it all in place,\npower the server on and I'm back up and\n\n67\n00:03:27.217 --> 00:03:28.618\nrunning like new, right?\n\n68\n00:03:28.618 --> 00:03:29.980\nThat's a bare metal backup,\n\n69\n00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.766\nthe problem with bare metal\nbackups is really two problems.\n\n70\n00:03:32.766 --> 00:03:35.678\nOne is they're big, cuz you have to\nback up the entire operating system.\n\n71\n00:03:35.678 --> 00:03:39.550\nWhat if it's a web server and the web\npages add up to a blazing 200 megabytes?\n\n72\n00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.218\nBut if I do a bare metal backup,\nI've got to get the operating system.\n\n73\n00:03:44.218 --> 00:03:47.942\nSo I'm gonna be at least 20 gigabytes\nby the time I get all of that, and\n\n74\n00:03:47.942 --> 00:03:49.135\nthe website and so on.\n\n75\n00:03:49.135 --> 00:03:50.710\nBackups are much larger.\n\n76\n00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.521\nSo bare metal backups are bigger, but\n\n77\n00:03:52.521 --> 00:03:55.700\nthey're really easy to restore\nbecause you've got everything.\n\n78\n00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.200\nYou just restore it all and\nyou're back in business.\n\n79\n00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.252\nA selective backup is where I say,\nI'm not gonna backup everything.\n\n80\n00:04:01.252 --> 00:04:01.992\nIt's just a web server.\n\n81\n00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:03.319\nI'm gonna backup the web pages.\n\n82\n00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.530\nThey're only 200 megabytes, 200 megabytes\nversus 20 gigabytes, that's far smaller.\n\n83\n00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.120\nI can back it up faster and easier, and\n\n84\n00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.170\nit will be less expensive cuz I need\nless storage medium to back up to.\n\n85\n00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.837\nBut when I go to do a restore,\nit somebody gives me a blank server.\n\n86\n00:04:18.837 --> 00:04:21.837\nA server with blank hard drives on it,\nand I need to restore the web server.\n\n87\n00:04:21.837 --> 00:04:24.314\nI can't just restore the webpages and\nthat's it.\n\n88\n00:04:24.314 --> 00:04:26.360\nI've gotta install the operating system.\n\n89\n00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.940\nI've got to go and\n\n90\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.880\nget a copy of RedHat Enterprises Linux or\nWindows Server or whatever.\n\n91\n00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.380\nI've got to reinstall it, and\nthen I've got to reconfigure it.\n\n92\n00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.481\nI've got to name it the same way\nthe server used to be named.\n\n93\n00:04:35.481 --> 00:04:38.353\nI've gotta give it the IP\naddress the server used to have.\n\n94\n00:04:38.353 --> 00:04:41.437\nI've gotta join it to a directory or a\ndomain or whatever it is that I have, and\n\n95\n00:04:41.437 --> 00:04:43.103\nwe've gotta do all this configuration.\n\n96\n00:04:43.103 --> 00:04:46.777\nAnd when all the configuration is done,\nthen I can restore the web pages,\n\n97\n00:04:46.777 --> 00:04:49.871\nwhich are only 200 megabytes,\nsuper easy, and off we go.\n\n98\n00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:57.055\nWell a selective restore is not a very\nfriendly thing to have in a total failure.\n\n99\n00:04:57.055 --> 00:05:00.337\nIn a partial failure,\nsomebody deleted a web page by accident.\n\n100\n00:05:00.337 --> 00:05:01.866\nI can go to the selective restore,\n\n101\n00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:04.252\nI can bring that one web page\nback no big deal, right?\n\n102\n00:05:04.252 --> 00:05:08.423\nBut if the whole server fails,\nI'm gonna want that bare metal backup.\n\n103\n00:05:08.423 --> 00:05:12.570\nSo normally companies do both,\nwhy pick one when you can do both, right?\n\n104\n00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.547\nThat we do a full backup maybe or not\na full backup sorry, a bare metal backup.\n\n105\n00:05:17.547 --> 00:05:21.589\nMaybe once a month, once a month you\ngrab an image of the entire server.\n\n106\n00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:23.918\nAnd then all throughout\nthe rest of the month,\n\n107\n00:05:23.918 --> 00:05:27.020\nyou just do a selective backup\nof the data on the server.\n\n108\n00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.080\nJust backing up the data and that way if\nyou ever have a failure, you can go and\n\n109\n00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.370\nyou can do the bare metal\nrestore to get it backup.\n\n110\n00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.218\nEven though that restore might\nbe data that's a month old.\n\n111\n00:05:37.218 --> 00:05:40.666\nAnd then I can take the data backup\nthat I just took that same day and\n\n112\n00:05:40.666 --> 00:05:43.320\nthrow it on there and\nnow I'm backup in business.\n\n113\n00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.310\nAnd that's when we start mixing and\nmatching some of these backup technologies\n\n114\n00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.280\nto find the perfect model for\nour environment.\n\n115\n00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.135\nYou gotta pick and\nchoose based on what you can do and\n\n116\n00:05:53.135 --> 00:05:56.101\nwhat your system can support, right?\n\n117\n00:05:56.101 --> 00:06:00.180\nUsually it's built around how long you\nhave to get back online again, right?\n\n118\n00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.140\nWhat's the maximum time\nI can be offline for?\n\n119\n00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.390\nIf I can leave for to be offline for\n\n120\n00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.800\nan hour, I need a backup solution that\nhas to be restore in under an hour.\n\n121\n00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.050\nI can't install Windows and configure it\nand assign an IP is an ad software and\n\n122\n00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.390\nthen restore data in under\nan hour just takes too long.\n\n123\n00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.500\nIt's not the reasonable solution, so\n\n124\n00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.720\nI've got to come up with\nthe solution that works.\n\n125\n00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.209\nNow whether you're doing bare metal or\nwhether you're doing selective.\n\n126\n00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:30.894\nFrom there you pick whether you want to do\na full differential shoot, brain freeze.\n\n127\n00:06:30.894 --> 00:06:34.337\nIncremental, there we go,\nI had to look at my notes,\n\n128\n00:06:34.337 --> 00:06:37.177\ndifferential incremental or copy backup.\n\n129\n00:06:37.177 --> 00:06:38.667\nAnd so what are all these?\n\n130\n00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:39.888\nA full backup.\n\n131\n00:06:39.888 --> 00:06:43.798\nA full backup says, for the files that I\npick which might be the entire system or\n\n132\n00:06:43.798 --> 00:06:45.053\nit might just be my data.\n\n133\n00:06:45.053 --> 00:06:47.706\nI'm gonna backup everything\nwhether it's changed or not.\n\n134\n00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:50.745\nI don't care if it's changed,\nI'm gonna back it up.\n\n135\n00:06:50.745 --> 00:06:52.126\nFull backups are nice.\n\n136\n00:06:52.126 --> 00:06:55.148\nBecause when you have a failure, you just\ngo and get the most recent full backup,\n\n137\n00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:56.590\nthat's gonna have everything.\n\n138\n00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.750\nI just get that one backup, it's got\nthe most recent data and I run with it.\n\n139\n00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.912\nBut if it's a huge set of data,\nif it's multiple terabytes of data,\n\n140\n00:07:04.912 --> 00:07:07.122\nthat full backup just takes too long.\n\n141\n00:07:07.122 --> 00:07:08.980\nSo I might only run it once a week.\n\n142\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.170\nMaybe every Saturday I run it,\n\n143\n00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:15.390\nbecause it's okay to run over to Sunday,\nor once a month, I do this massive backup.\n\n144\n00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.140\nAnd the rest of the time,\nI need to find something smaller.\n\n145\n00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.632\nAnd the solution to do a smaller backup\nis an incremental or a differential.\n\n146\n00:07:23.632 --> 00:07:26.378\nSo let's talk about\nthe differences between these two.\n\n147\n00:07:26.378 --> 00:07:32.341\nThe differential is the most common and\nwith a differential, what happens is,\n\n148\n00:07:32.341 --> 00:07:38.290\nwhen we go to do our backups,\na differential just backs up what changed.\n\n149\n00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.280\nSo if we take a look at this backup\nscenario that I've got here.\n\n150\n00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.920\nOn Monday, I'm doing a full backup.\n\n151\n00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.376\nI'm backing up 100 gigabytes of data.\n\n152\n00:07:46.376 --> 00:07:48.732\nI'm backing up everything, all right?\n\n153\n00:07:48.732 --> 00:07:54.464\nWell Monday at 6 AM,\nI'm running a differential backup.\n\n154\n00:07:54.464 --> 00:08:00.548\nAnd a differential backup will only backup\nwhat's changed Since the last full backup.\n\n155\n00:08:00.548 --> 00:08:05.223\nSo there was a full backup at midnight,\nand so in that time six hours passed,\n\n156\n00:08:05.223 --> 00:08:07.600\nfive gigabytes of data changed.\n\n157\n00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.180\nAnd so I just back up five gigabytes.\n\n158\n00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.510\nThat's a very small backup,\nit can happen very quickly.\n\n159\n00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.830\nAt noon well,\n\n160\n00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.820\nwe've had ten gigabytes of data that's\nchanged all the way since the full backup.\n\n161\n00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.090\nAnd so now,\nwe do a backup in this ten gigs in size.\n\n162\n00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.030\nAnd then at 6 p.m.\n\n163\n00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.090\nWe do another backup.\n\n164\n00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.700\nAnd now five more gigs have changed.\n\n165\n00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.950\nSo we're up to 15 gigs.\n\n166\n00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.750\nWe're getting bigger and\nbigger and bigger each time.\n\n167\n00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.020\n&gt;&gt; My question is gonna be why is that,\nDon?\n\n168\n00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:40.645\nWhy are you, by the time you get to\n1800 hours there, you're at 15 gigabytes\n\n169\n00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:44.430\nwhen you've already got a backup\nat 600 hours there a five gigs.\n\n170\n00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.870\nWhy is that just steadily\nget increased in size?\n\n171\n00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.610\n&gt;&gt; What it comes down to is\nthe difficulty to restore.\n\n172\n00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:55.540\nThe idea here is that if I have a failure,\nwhere is that failure, right?\n\n173\n00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:00.923\nSo let say the failure occurs\nright here at 2300 hours.\n\n174\n00:09:00.923 --> 00:09:04.310\nSo at 2300 hours, I had a failure.\n\n175\n00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.760\nIt's 11 p.m.\nIt's almost midnight and I have a failure.\n\n176\n00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.160\nWell, I was about to run a full back\nup at midnight but that didn't happen.\n\n177\n00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:10.699\nI've got a failure.\n\n178\n00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.952\nI can go to my back up at 6 p.m.\n\n179\n00:09:14.952 --> 00:09:16.900\nThen I can restore it, right.\n\n180\n00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.080\nWell, done back up at 6 p.m.\n\n181\n00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.904\nOnly has a portion of my data its\nonly got 15 gigabytes of my data,\n\n182\n00:09:23.904 --> 00:09:29.778\nwhat I actually need to do is restore the\nfull back up from the previous midnight.\n\n183\n00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:35.070\nAnd then the most recent differential, the\nnewest differential backup that I have,\n\n184\n00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:39.350\nand it will contain everything that\nchanged since that full backup.\n\n185\n00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.660\nI actually don't need this one,\nand I don't need this one.\n\n186\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.500\nI need the full backup, and\nthe most recent differential.\n\n187\n00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.142\nIf this failure actually\nhappened here at 5 p.m.\n\n188\n00:09:50.142 --> 00:09:54.660\nOr something, then I would\njust use the backup from noon.\n\n189\n00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.360\nBut because the backup happened at 11\np.m., I have this one available and\n\n190\n00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.330\nI can use it.\n\n191\n00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.380\nSo with the differential,\nwhen you go to do a restore,\n\n192\n00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.920\nyou need two different backups to restore.\n\n193\n00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.074\nBut most recent full backup and\nthe most recent differential back up.\n\n194\n00:10:10.074 --> 00:10:13.601\nAnd you gonna use those two to get as\nclose to the point of area responsible and\n\n195\n00:10:13.601 --> 00:10:15.710\nwe're store your data getting back online.\n\n196\n00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.199\nOn a positive side,\nI only need two backups and\n\n197\n00:10:19.199 --> 00:10:22.701\nthese backups were smaller than\nfull backups throughout the day.\n\n198\n00:10:22.701 --> 00:10:25.295\nI could just do full backups\nthroughout the day but\n\n199\n00:10:25.295 --> 00:10:27.530\nthat becomes larger sets of data, right?\n\n200\n00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.290\nI'd be backing up a 100 gigs every time.\n\n201\n00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:34.950\nNow, on a negative side, if I wanna do\na restore, I do need to have two backups.\n\n202\n00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.410\nSo I can't just go and grab one tape,\npop it in, and restore.\n\n203\n00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.320\nI've gotta go grab two tapes.\n\n204\n00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.970\nAnd if one of them's messed up,\nthen I'm gonna lose some data.\n\n205\n00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.770\nIf this full backup was messed up,\n\n206\n00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.210\nevery differential afterwards\nis gonna be messed up also.\n\n207\n00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.040\nSo it's not gonna quite work out for me.\n\n208\n00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.820\nSo that's the risk we\nhave with a differential.\n\n209\n00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.250\nAnd the other thing is the backups\nare getting bigger and bigger and bigger.\n\n210\n00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.640\nSo in the morning,\nit might be a nice, fast backup.\n\n211\n00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.430\nIt's only five gigs.\n\n212\n00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.100\nMaybe it takes two minutes.\n\n213\n00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.000\nBut then then next one takes four minutes.\n\n214\n00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.380\nAnd the next one takes eight minutes.\n\n215\n00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.450\nAnd it starts getting longer and\nlonger and longer.\n\n216\n00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.430\nAnd so by the end of the day,\nmaybe the backups take too long to run.\n\n217\n00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.370\nThey get bigger and bigger.\n\n218\n00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.490\nSo to help with that we\nhave another option.\n\n219\n00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.710\nThe other option is an incremental backup.\n\n220\n00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:18.830\nAnd with an incremental backup,\nit's different than a differential.\n\n221\n00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.600\nInstead of backing up everything\nsince the last full backup,\n\n222\n00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.385\nit only backs up everything since\nthe last incremental backup, or\n\n223\n00:11:26.385 --> 00:11:29.555\nwhatever the last backup was,\nwhether it was full or incremental.\n\n224\n00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:35.200\nSo when we do that backup at midnight,\nwe back up 100 gigs of data, and then at 6\n\n225\n00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:40.957\na.m., we're just backing up what changed\nright here in between midnight and 6 a.m.\n\n226\n00:11:40.957 --> 00:11:44.127\nAnd it's five gigs,\nit gets written right here.\n\n227\n00:11:44.127 --> 00:11:49.268\nAt noon, we do a backup and it's just\nwhat changed between 6 a.m., and noon.\n\n228\n00:11:50.557 --> 00:11:57.050\nAnd then we do a backup at 6 p.m and it's\njust what changed between 6 p.m and noon.\n\n229\n00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.850\nAnd so each one only contains\na small set of data.\n\n230\n00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.000\nIt doesn't get bigger and bigger.\n\n231\n00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.920\nIt just would change that window of time.\n\n232\n00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.300\n&gt;&gt; And Don compared to the differential\nbackup, how does that affect our\n\n233\n00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.530\nrestoration process, if we're gonna be\nusing something like the incremental?\n\n234\n00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.980\n&gt;&gt; Well so this one's more complex, right.\n\n235\n00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.200\nIt's the most complex.\n\n236\n00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.130\nBecause if I have a failure,\n\n237\n00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.220\nlet's just say we had that failure\nin the midnight again, right.\n\n238\n00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.302\nSo, I'm gonna chuck that\nfailure right there and\n\n239\n00:12:21.302 --> 00:12:26.258\nI've got my failure Well I need\nto restore the full backup and\n\n240\n00:12:26.258 --> 00:12:28.899\nevery incremental since then.\n\n241\n00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:32.060\nBecause a file might have\nchanged here in this backup.\n\n242\n00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.530\nA different file might have\nchanged in the second backup,\n\n243\n00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.740\na third file might have\nchanged in the third backup.\n\n244\n00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.886\nI need use all of them.\n\n245\n00:12:37.886 --> 00:12:41.173\nSo I need everyone of those incremental\nbackups to do the restore and\n\n246\n00:12:41.173 --> 00:12:44.011\nin this case I would end up\ndoing four restore operations.\n\n247\n00:12:44.011 --> 00:12:47.842\nI would restore the full and then I would\nrestore the three incrementals in order to\n\n248\n00:12:47.842 --> 00:12:51.228\nget the system back to as recent as\npossible before the point of failure,\n\n249\n00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:52.220\nall right?\n\n250\n00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.870\nIt's more work.\n\n251\n00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:55.620\nIt's harder to do the restore.\n\n252\n00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.880\nIt's easier to do the backups.\n\n253\n00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.950\nThe backups are nice and small, right?\n\n254\n00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.810\nAnd that's why they're so\nuseful to do during the day like this.\n\n255\n00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.240\nA lot of companies if you're a small or\n\n256\n00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.130\nmedium business, you probably just\ndo a full backup every night.\n\n257\n00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:11.124\nThat's what a lot of companies do but\nif I am doing a full back up every night\n\n258\n00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:16.036\nat midnight and I have a failure at\n11:30 pm I just lost 23 and a half\n\n259\n00:13:16.036 --> 00:13:21.137\nhours of data its been 23 and a half\nhours since my last back at that point.\n\n260\n00:13:21.137 --> 00:13:24.956\nCan you afford to lose 23 and\na half hours of data maybe you can if you\n\n261\n00:13:24.956 --> 00:13:28.188\nare a small or\nmedium business that's probably, okay.\n\n262\n00:13:28.188 --> 00:13:32.742\nBut if you're an enterprise, if you're\nsomebody like Amazon that does $1 million\n\n263\n00:13:32.742 --> 00:13:37.380\nin sales per hour, can you afford\nto lose $23.5 million in sales?\n\n264\n00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.850\nWell, they can afford it, I'm sure.\n\n265\n00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.750\nBut you don't want to do it, right?\n\n266\n00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:41.820\nIn that scenario.\n\n267\n00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.390\nIf you're a hospital,\n\n268\n00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:48.680\ncan you lose 23.5 hours of prescriptions\nthat have been issued out to patients?\n\n269\n00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.150\nAbsolutely not, people could die.\n\n270\n00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.380\nYou can't do that.\n\n271\n00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.460\nSo company's like that are backing\nup throughout the day.\n\n272\n00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.700\nIn fact, I've worked on a lot of database\nservers where you do continuous backups.\n\n273\n00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.030\nSo the databases are always\nbeing backed up so\n\n274\n00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:07.570\nthat if there's a failure you can\nrecover right to the moment of failure.\n\n275\n00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:11.906\nEven in my scenario here, if my last\nbackup happened at 1800 hours, right.\n\n276\n00:14:11.906 --> 00:14:15.790\nIt's 6 pm, and\nmy failure happens at 11 pm, 2300 hours.\n\n277\n00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.370\nThat's a five hour difference.\n\n278\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.560\nWhat happens to the data that was\nchanged during those five hours?\n\n279\n00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.390\nIt's gone.\n\n280\n00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:24.350\nI lost it.\n\n281\n00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:27.380\nMaybe I can recover it off the drives,\nbut if we're talking about a fire or\n\n282\n00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.500\nsomething it's gone.\n\n283\n00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.800\nI can't get to it.\n\n284\n00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.220\nSo now, I've lost that data.\n\n285\n00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.910\nCan I afford to lose five\nhours of data maybe right.\n\n286\n00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.790\nYou need to have that talk with\nyour CIO with your executives.\n\n287\n00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.802\nThey need to set that rule of how\nmuch data can we afford to lose.\n\n288\n00:14:43.802 --> 00:14:46.666\nAnd if they tell you we can't afford\nto lose any data, you've gotta set\n\n289\n00:14:46.666 --> 00:14:49.919\nup real time synchronization between your\ncenter and another disaster recovery\n\n290\n00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:53.230\nlocation somewhere else right,\nthat's really important.\n\n291\n00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.760\nBut if you can afford to lose 6 hours or\n12 hours or\n\n292\n00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.010\n24 hours, three days of data, then you can\nplan your backup strategy around that.\n\n293\n00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:04.660\nAll right, so I've talked about full,\nincremental, differential.\n\n294\n00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.430\nLet's talk about copies.\n\n295\n00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:09.050\nEvery now and then,\nI just wanna take a backup.\n\n296\n00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.560\nMaybe I've got a maintenance window and\n\n297\n00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.840\nI'm about to deploy\na service pack on a server.\n\n298\n00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.150\nAnd so I decide I'm gonna take\na full back up right now.\n\n299\n00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:15.760\nBefore I deploy.\n\n300\n00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.260\nI'm gonna take a server offline,\ntake a full back up and\n\n301\n00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.610\nthen I'm gonna make my change.\n\n302\n00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:20.950\nThat way if I hose it up good,\n\n303\n00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:24.870\nwhich I'm pretty talented at, then I can\nrestore it and put it right back, right?\n\n304\n00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.320\nWell here's the problem, if we're doing\nincremental like what I've shown here.\n\n305\n00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.240\nAnd all of a sudden I come along.\n\n306\n00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.770\nAnd I do a full backup right here.\n\n307\n00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:36.600\nOkay.\n\n308\n00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.210\nWhen I do this full backup right here,\nit breaks up my schedule.\n\n309\n00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.550\nActually it wouldn't\nnecessarily be a full on.\n\n310\n00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.670\nI'm talking about a copy.\n\n311\n00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:46.450\nThat doesn't fit, but\n[LAUGH] Well, anyhow.\n\n312\n00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.960\nI come along and I do a copy, right?\n\n313\n00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.270\nIf I did a full backup here,\nthat would break up my incrementals.\n\n314\n00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.946\nAnd if we had a failure at 2300 hours and\nsomebody went to do a restore,\n\n315\n00:15:56.946 --> 00:16:00.326\nthey might go and grab This full backup,\nand this incremental, and\n\n316\n00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:03.680\nan incremental that ran here, and\nand incremental that ran here.\n\n317\n00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.528\nAnd it's gonna be all messed up,\n\n318\n00:16:05.528 --> 00:16:10.180\nbecause they didn't realize that I ran\na full backup here and broke it up.\n\n319\n00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:14.540\nSo when you run a copy,\na copy is a full backup.\n\n320\n00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.500\nBut it doesn't mess with\nthe archive attribute, and so\n\n321\n00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.080\nit allows the increment\nto stay where they are.\n\n322\n00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.179\nSo, I can run a copy for\nmy own purposes right here.\n\n323\n00:16:23.179 --> 00:16:26.220\nAnd if there was a failure,\nsomebody can use my copy,\n\n324\n00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.320\nand we still hope, but\nideally they just set it aside.\n\n325\n00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.030\nThey would use the four backup,\n\n326\n00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:35.050\nand each incremental as planned as\ndefined,in our documentation for\n\n327\n00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:38.850\nbusiness recovery or business resumption,\nand built to get back on online.\n\n328\n00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.430\nA copy is designed to be\na one time full back up.\n\n329\n00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.830\nNot a scheduled routine thing but just\nsomething that you're running one time\n\n330\n00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.100\nas part of a maintenance window or\nwhatever.\n\n331\n00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.330\nA copy is just like a full back up, but\n\n332\n00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.820\nit doesn't break up differentials or\nincrementals if you've got them coming up.\n\n333\n00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.700\nIt doesn't reset the archive\nattribute used to track that.\n\n334\n00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:58.690\nSo I said the difference there.\n\n335\n00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.840\nAnd today is where a lot of us\nwhere deploying virtual machines.\n\n336\n00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.470\nAnd virtual machines have\na neat technology and\n\n337\n00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:10.480\npulse snapshot that I can be working\nwith the virtual machine, and\n\n338\n00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.430\nif I change something, I can just take a\nsnapshot of it and I can roll it back and\n\n339\n00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.580\nroll it forward and\ndo whatever as I make it change.\n\n340\n00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:21.230\nSo I'm about to deploy a service pack so\nI take a snapshot of it.\n\n341\n00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.590\nAnd then I go on and make the change.\n\n342\n00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:25.020\nAnd if really hoses things up,\nI just rolled back to the snapshot.\n\n343\n00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.940\nWell, what is the snapshot?\n\n344\n00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:30.140\nWhat it does is it takes the virtual\nhard drive of your vm and\n\n345\n00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:30.890\nit makes it read only.\n\n346\n00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:33.110\nIt says hey I'm gonna make\nyour hard drive read only.\n\n347\n00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.590\nAnd any time somebody tries\nto write to the hard drive,\n\n348\n00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.720\nit puts the changes in a separate file.\n\n349\n00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.650\nSo it's got all the changes\nright here in a separate file,\n\n350\n00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.950\nand all your original\ndata in a read only file.\n\n351\n00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.760\nAnd you run, and if something goes wrong.\n\n352\n00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.600\nAnd you wanna roll back it just\ndeletes the file ahead the changes now\n\n353\n00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.120\nyou're back to the old file and you're\nback in business, it's as simple as that.\n\n354\n00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.030\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, $6 million question you\ncan help me hopefully solve this one.\n\n355\n00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:58.840\nIs a snapshot and I'm talking\nstrictly in a virtual environment,\n\n356\n00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.330\nis a snapshot a replacement for backups?\n\n357\n00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.150\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not, absolutely not.\n\n358\n00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.980\nThere are two big\nweaknesses with snapshots.\n\n359\n00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.250\nOn the positive side they\nare great,super fast,great\n\n360\n00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.290\nsafety that I'm using all the time,right.\n\n361\n00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.068\nTwo big weaknesses though.\n\n362\n00:18:12.068 --> 00:18:13.650\nNumber one performance.\n\n363\n00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.590\nThe virtual hard drive,a virtual\nmachine that's in production,should\n\n364\n00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.200\nbe what is called a fixed disk.\n\n365\n00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:23.780\nIf I say it's 64 gigs inside, the file is\n64 gigs even if it's empty,it's 64 gigs.\n\n366\n00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.820\nBut when you start doing changes and do\na snapshot and make that drive read only.\n\n367\n00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.500\nThe changes get written into a file that's\nnot fixed in size, it grows as the data\n\n368\n00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.330\ngrows which leads to fragmentation,\nwhich leads to poor dispositioning.\n\n369\n00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.110\nAnd if you're on an ssd it's not so\nbad, but\n\n370\n00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.740\nif you're on a spinning disk it's bad,\nyou don't want that.\n\n371\n00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.730\nSo snapshots should be temporary.\n\n372\n00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.360\nDo you use the snap shot\nwhile you make the change.\n\n373\n00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.860\nWhen everything's fine you\neither commit the snapshot or\n\n374\n00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.540\nroll back, one or the other.\n\n375\n00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.590\nDon't keep snap shots around.\n\n376\n00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.820\nThey're not designed to be retained for\nlong periods of time.\n\n377\n00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.190\nThat's weakness number one.\n\n378\n00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.520\nWeakness number two,\nwhere's the snapshot stored?\n\n379\n00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.700\nWell, it's just taking your hard drive,\nyour virtual hard drive, and\n\n380\n00:18:58.700 --> 00:18:59.920\nmaking it read only.\n\n381\n00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.020\nIn other words,\nit's still stored in that one place and\n\n382\n00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.160\nthe changes will store right\nbeside of the same disk.\n\n383\n00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:10.390\nIf the physical drive fails, you lose\nboth, your regular drive and the snapshot.\n\n384\n00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.760\nIt doesn’t provide you\nany hardware protection.\n\n385\n00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.980\nSnapshots are designed for\nsoftware failures only.\n\n386\n00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.410\nOkay, I installed the service pack\nit's really bad, I want to roll back.\n\n387\n00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:19.720\nGreat, a snapshot will take care of you.\n\n388\n00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.060\nMy physical hard drive failed, tough luck,\nsnapshot's stored on the same drive.\n\n389\n00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.830\nAnd even if the snapshot\nwas on a separate drive,\n\n390\n00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:28.140\nthe snapshot by itself isn't enough.\n\n391\n00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.870\nYou have to have the original disk,\nplus the changes.\n\n392\n00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:35.020\nIf you just have one or the other,\nnot gonna help you, right?\n\n393\n00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.830\nSo snap shots are not a replacement for\nbackups.\n\n394\n00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.300\nYou still need to be doing a backup.\n\n395\n00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.110\nAnd the big difference is,\n\n396\n00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:44.470\nwhen you do a regular backup,\nyou're backing up to some other location.\n\n397\n00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.690\nWe're gonna talk about those\nlocations in just a moment.\n\n398\n00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:50.650\nI do need to mention two last things\nbefore I talk about the different places\n\n399\n00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.230\nwe can backup and\nthen we'll dive into that.\n\n400\n00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.930\nI mentioned bare metal backups\nWe back up everything.\n\n401\n00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:58.760\nThe data as well as the operating system.\n\n402\n00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.660\nWhen you go to do a restore\nyou can choose to do that.\n\n403\n00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.470\nYou can choose to restore everything,\nthe operating system and the data or\n\n404\n00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:08.020\nyou can split it out where\nyou just restore the data.\n\n405\n00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.190\nWe talked a little bit about that earlier.\n\n406\n00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:13.340\nThat when you do a data versus\nan operating system restore,\n\n407\n00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:16.200\nwith the data you're expecting\nthe operating system to already be there.\n\n408\n00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.820\nIn other words you're expecting not\na hardware failure but a software failure.\n\n409\n00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.720\nI'm just restoring\nthe data the OS is fine.\n\n410\n00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.590\nEverything's good.\n\n411\n00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.580\nMy SQL database got messed up so\nI'm just gonna restore the SQL database.\n\n412\n00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.330\nThat's a data restore.\n\n413\n00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.840\nBut if you have a hardware failure,\n\n414\n00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.030\nif the hard drives are gone,\nyour operating system is gone, too.\n\n415\n00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.240\nAnd so\nyou're gonna need to bring that back.\n\n416\n00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.560\nAnd if you have a full backup\nof the bare metal system,\n\n417\n00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.560\nof the operating system, everything.\n\n418\n00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.240\nYou can restore it all at once,\n\n419\n00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.890\nif not you're gonna have to reconfigure\nthe OS and it takes a long time.\n\n420\n00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.240\n&gt;&gt; You know Don,\nI know that on my personal PC.\n\n421\n00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.630\nWhich is completely different, again,\n\n422\n00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.120\nlike I've said before,\nfrom the server environment.\n\n423\n00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.440\nI know that I put my operating system\non a little striped SSD array, and\n\n424\n00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.630\nI put my data on some\nseparate spinning disks.\n\n425\n00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:58.900\nBut now,\nI don't mind losing my operating system.\n\n426\n00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.790\nJust reinstall it.\n\n427\n00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:01.320\nMy data's fine.\n\n428\n00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.670\nI would think it's not necessarily\ngoing to be the case in a server or\n\n429\n00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:10.140\na data center, are there considerations\nof how I would set that up.\n\n430\n00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.580\nIs one better than the other?\n\n431\n00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.000\nHave it all one disk or\nhave it separated like that.\n\n432\n00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.940\n&gt;&gt; It makes no real difference,\nnot really.\n\n433\n00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.960\nYou can separate it for performance\nreasons, you would separate that out.\n\n434\n00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.920\nAs far as backups are concerned, it really\nmakes no difference whether your hard\n\n435\n00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.270\ndrives are in the same server or\nyou wanna have data drives on the sand and\n\n436\n00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:27.960\noperating drives system\ndrives in the server.\n\n437\n00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.620\nOr both might be in the sand.\n\n438\n00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.620\nBut as far as the backup is concerned\nit doesn't care where the disks are.\n\n439\n00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.230\nWe just need to have a good clean backup.\n\n440\n00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.080\nCause you wanna store to disks\nin a different location.\n\n441\n00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:41.000\nI might have a server with the drives are\nall in the sand but I have a failure and\n\n442\n00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000\nI stand up a new server where\nthe drives are actually in the server.\n\n443\n00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.410\nAnd so I restore to different location.\n\n444\n00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.430\nYou can certainly do that.\n\n445\n00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.070\nAnother consideration we have to have.\n\n446\n00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:52.640\nIs that with servers online work stations,\nthey're constantly in use,\n\n447\n00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.370\npeople are in there.\n\n448\n00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.010\nAnd when you got something\nlike a data base,\n\n449\n00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.380\nthe database is constantly being used.\n\n450\n00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:58.620\nI mean that's constantly changing.\n\n451\n00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.310\nHow do you backup something\nthat's constantly changing.\n\n452\n00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:04.660\nWell most of these systems will have\na technology built in them that allows you\n\n453\n00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.370\nto back them up while they're running.\n\n454\n00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.420\nIn a Linux environment you weren't\nbe running a Mariadb or MySQL and\n\n455\n00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.740\nthey have backup commands.\n\n456\n00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.920\nThat can effectively take a snapshot and\nthen dump that out as a backup that is\n\n457\n00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.090\na single point in time,\nthat has no uncommitted rights to it.\n\n458\n00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:21.240\nThat's important to not\nget corrupted data.\n\n459\n00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.360\nMicrosoft has something called\nthe Volume Shadow Copy Service.\n\n460\n00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.340\nAnd it allows you to grab these\nsingle point in time backups\n\n461\n00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.920\nof files that aren't being written to.\n\n462\n00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.990\nSo if somebody is writing to a file,\nit will say, all right, as soon as they're\n\n463\n00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:37.410\ndone, freeze the file so I can take a back\nup of it and then let people back into it.\n\n464\n00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:41.210\nSo it gives that little window of time to\nbe able to grab the firewalls in tact.\n\n465\n00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:44.670\nOpen files cannot be\nbacked up without help.\n\n466\n00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:45.570\nBecause if it's open and\n\n467\n00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.200\nsomebody's changing it,\nI'm gonna back it up mid-change.\n\n468\n00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.220\nI'm gonna restore it mid-change,\nnow it's corrupt.\n\n469\n00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.710\nSo you've gotta make sure you have good\nclean data that gets backed up to your\n\n470\n00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.910\nSystems, so you could restore from it.\n\n471\n00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:01.400\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, we've been talking a lot\nabout what we put in those backups and\n\n472\n00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:05.440\nhow we put data, what determines\nwhat's in the media itself.\n\n473\n00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.760\nWhat we haven't talked about is\nwhat are we storing that data on?\n\n474\n00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.990\nCan you help us out with that?\n\n475\n00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.870\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nThere's two different\n\n476\n00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.460\nplaces we can back up to in today's world.\n\n477\n00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.570\nAnd there's new stuff coming out\nall the time really, but, But\n\n478\n00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:18.350\nyou've really got linear and\nrandom access media, all right.\n\n479\n00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:22.140\nLinear media is the most common,\nits tapes, backup tapes.\n\n480\n00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.740\nLTO and a few of the other\ntechnologies that are out there.\n\n481\n00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.490\nI know what some of you are thinking,\ntapes is practically reel to reel,\n\n482\n00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.260\nwhy are people still using\nthis this old technology?\n\n483\n00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:35.770\nThe thing about tape is, its cheap,\nyou can get terabytes of tape storage for\n\n484\n00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:41.060\nfar less than buying hard drives and\nthey're very easy to move around.\n\n485\n00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.790\nI can run a back up on tape,\nI can pop the tape out and\n\n486\n00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:48.140\ndrop it in a portable safe and\nsend it somewhere for offside storage.\n\n487\n00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.880\nReally sibship around.\n\n488\n00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.730\nSpinning disks, not so much.\n\n489\n00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.152\nSpinning disks are random access.\n\n490\n00:23:53.152 --> 00:23:57.227\nRandom access means that I could hook\nup that spinning disk and read from any\n\n491\n00:23:57.227 --> 00:24:01.702\nsector of it at any time, right, versus\na tape, you read it linearly, in order.\n\n492\n00:24:01.702 --> 00:24:03.383\nI read from the beginning\nof the tape to the end and\n\n493\n00:24:03.383 --> 00:24:05.728\nif I wanna read from the middle of\nthe tape I've gotta fast forward.\n\n494\n00:24:05.728 --> 00:24:08.725\n[SOUND] You know it, and\nthat fast forward might take five or\n\n495\n00:24:08.725 --> 00:24:11.979\nten minutes just to get to the point\nwhere I want to read my data.\n\n496\n00:24:11.979 --> 00:24:17.170\nTapes are slow, they're slow but\nthey're cheap and they're fairly durable.\n\n497\n00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:21.510\nAnd that means we can have lots of them,\nremember we don't launch one backup.\n\n498\n00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:25.800\nWe want backups from a month ago,\nsix months ago, a year ago, and\n\n499\n00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.760\nthat way when somebody comes and\nsays, hey, we got a lawsuit.\n\n500\n00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.640\nWe need this user's documents and\nfolders from September of last year.\n\n501\n00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.210\nWe'll, I don't have it, well now,\nyou go to court because\n\n502\n00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.970\nyou didn't do your proper data\nretention like you're supposed to.\n\n503\n00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:45.100\nBut if you have cassette tapes, not\ncassette tapes, I keep talking about them.\n\n504\n00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.210\nI'll pull up something in\nthe background here, so\n\n505\n00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:50.930\nI can show you what I'm talking\nabout when I talk about LTOs.\n\n506\n00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:55.040\nBut with these tapes, you can get them,\nand they're not incredibly expensive.\n\n507\n00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.490\nYou can get them in different,\n\n508\n00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:59.870\nhere, let's just jump to, that's\nthe actual organization that makes them.\n\n509\n00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.846\nI'll go shopping here on CDW,\n\n510\n00:25:01.846 --> 00:25:05.950\nand pull up some of the tape\ncartridges that are out there.\n\n511\n00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:11.131\nBut the tape cartridges that\nare out there are darn it these\n\n512\n00:25:11.131 --> 00:25:15.899\nare all standards,\nare usually high storage right.\n\n513\n00:25:15.899 --> 00:25:21.774\nHere's an 800 GB tape all right,\nan 800 GB tape for $27.99, all right.\n\n514\n00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.790\nNot a whole heck of a lot of money,\nright, and some of them go even larger.\n\n515\n00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:32.352\nHere's one with a compressed\ncapacity of three terabytes, for\n\n516\n00:25:32.352 --> 00:25:35.940\n$30, uncompressed it's 1.5 terabytes.\n\n517\n00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.660\nSo can I get a 1.5 terabyte hard drive for\n$30?\n\n518\n00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.546\nMaybe a really cheap one, right, a really\ncheap laptop one that if I tried to ship\n\n519\n00:25:43.546 --> 00:25:46.680\nthat somewhere it would likely\nget damaged and not work.\n\n520\n00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.290\nThese are tapes, I can back over these,\nthey're very durable.\n\n521\n00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:52.480\nAnd I can store them on a shelf, I can\nreference them, you can get tape robots\n\n522\n00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.400\nthat actually manage the whole library for\nyou, they're incredibly expensive.\n\n523\n00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:00.190\nBut this type of media really lends\nitself to being backup to and\n\n524\n00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:04.200\nthen stuck on a shelf, or sent offsite,\nand stored for long periods of time.\n\n525\n00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.937\nAnd that's why we still see tapes today,\nit sounds like old antiquated\n\n526\n00:26:07.937 --> 00:26:13.020\ntechnology but most data centers still\nhave tape based backup somewhere in there.\n\n527\n00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:18.300\nNow, many of them have started moving to\nrandom access, backing up the hard drives.\n\n528\n00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:22.248\nBut because of the difficulty to ship\nthem, you've got this challenge.\n\n529\n00:26:22.248 --> 00:26:25.010\nYou don't wanna throw hard\ndrives in your car, and\n\n530\n00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.860\nif you get SSDs,\nyou don't have to worry about it so much.\n\n531\n00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:27.820\nBut if you have spinning disks,\n\n532\n00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.880\nyou don't want to move them\nanymore than you have to.\n\n533\n00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.740\nSo what a lot of organizations do is\nthey set up a disaster recovery center.\n\n534\n00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.270\nA data center somewhere else, and\n\n535\n00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:38.110\nthey do an online synchronization of\nthe back ups to the other location.\n\n536\n00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:41.400\nAnd then that way it's automatically\noffsite, we didn't have to ship anything,\n\n537\n00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.350\nit just went over the wire\nto the other side.\n\n538\n00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:48.900\nOn a positive side you've got offsite\nbackups that are very up to date.\n\n539\n00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.900\nAnd you can restore the moment's notice.\n\n540\n00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.170\nWith the LTO tapes,\n\n541\n00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.810\nwe used to ship them offsite and\nwe used a company called Iron Mountain.\n\n542\n00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:57.910\nAnd if we ever had a failure and\nwe needed the offsite tape,\n\n543\n00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:00.630\nwe would have to call Iron Mountain,\nand they would have to go and\n\n544\n00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.370\nretrieve the tape and deliver it to us.\n\n545\n00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:04.190\nIt took at least two hours,\nit would take two hours for\n\n546\n00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.240\nus to get the tape in our hand.\n\n547\n00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.720\nNothing bad about Iron Mountain, it takes\ntime to find a tape, put in the car and\n\n548\n00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.430\ndrive it over.\n\n549\n00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:13.400\nThat's that window of time,\nyou can't do it any better.\n\n550\n00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.090\nSo you'd get that tape and\nthen you could start your restore.\n\n551\n00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:20.987\nBut if it's an online backup to storage\nsomewhere else, I can immediately reach\n\n552\n00:27:20.987 --> 00:27:23.924\nout and grab it and\nstart to restore data and pull it, right.\n\n553\n00:27:23.924 --> 00:27:26.453\nSo that's the advantage of doing it that\nway, there was a negative, though, and\n\n554\n00:27:26.453 --> 00:27:28.190\na lot of companies are learning this.\n\n555\n00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:31.130\nIf your backups are online like that, and\n\n556\n00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:35.860\nyou get hacked or you get ransomware,\nthose backups are online.\n\n557\n00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.760\nSomebody can access them over the network,\nand you're hearing about schools\n\n558\n00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:43.270\nwhere hey, their servers get encrypted,\nand their backups get encrypted, too.\n\n559\n00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:46.330\nAnd now they can't recover the data\ncuz the backups were online.\n\n560\n00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:49.600\nHaving an offline backup guarantees\nthat's not gonna happen.\n\n561\n00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.307\nIf I have tapes that are stored in a\ncabinet over at Iron Mountain or wherever,\n\n562\n00:27:53.307 --> 00:27:57.184\nthen somebody could hack in and access all\nof my systems and I would still know that\n\n563\n00:27:57.184 --> 00:28:01.170\nI had those tapes and they were safe and\nthat I'd be able to recover it.\n\n564\n00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:04.370\nYou can actually do a mixture of the two,\nyou can have online backup and\n\n565\n00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:07.500\ntape backup, and that way, yeah,\nsomebody compromised the online backup.\n\n566\n00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.100\nThat really stinks, but if they don't,\nit's still available I can use it.\n\n567\n00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.790\nAnd then I've got my tape\nbackup that I can still get to.\n\n568\n00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:15.670\nSo mixing the technologies\nlike this can really help.\n\n569\n00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:18.350\nBacking up to disk, removable media,\n\n570\n00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:22.900\nthose are really common, optical\nmedia is all but dead at this point.\n\n571\n00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:27.630\nBacking up to DVD and CD, the storage\ncapacity is just not that great, right.\n\n572\n00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.320\nOn a CD, if you get a dual layer,\nwhat's a dual layer, 9.?\n\n573\n00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:34.730\n&gt;&gt; On the DVD's, it's gonna be 9.4 gigs,\n4.7 gigs per size.\n\n574\n00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.220\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Per side, excuse me.\n\n575\n00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.830\n&gt;&gt; Not a ton of storage there,\nversus I'm showing you guys here, one and\n\n576\n00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.390\na half terabytes on a single tape for\n30 bucks.\n\n577\n00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.070\nA DVD, a dual layer DVD,\n\n578\n00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:46.690\nwhich already costs a little more,\nyou're not getting much more.\n\n579\n00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:50.070\nAnd they're slow to write not that\ntapes are blazing fast either.\n\n580\n00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:54.480\nBut what happens when that CD gets full,\nyou gotta take it out and\n\n581\n00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.630\nput the next one in.\n\n582\n00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:58.820\nThere's not a whole lot of CD auto\nloaders out there, they do make them.\n\n583\n00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.580\nThere's plenty of tape robots though where\nyou can put eight tapes in there and\n\n584\n00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.670\nit'll cycle through each one and\ndo the full backup.\n\n585\n00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:07.650\nAnd there's even big ones hundreds or\neven thousands of tapes.\n\n586\n00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:10.590\nAnd you can set those up to be\nable to do automated backups and\n\n587\n00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:13.430\napplication so\nreally really neat stuff out there.\n\n588\n00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:17.150\n&gt;&gt; All right Don I'm gonna very, I work\nfor a company that's got a lot of money.\n\n589\n00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.461\nAll right and we're gonna manager\nmedium we just implement a tape robot\n\n590\n00:29:20.461 --> 00:29:22.820\nnext concept is done, taken care of.\n\n591\n00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:27.130\nHowever maybe we don't have\nthe money to support one of those\n\n592\n00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.342\nmedia robots like that.\n\n593\n00:29:28.342 --> 00:29:29.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How are we,\n\n594\n00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:32.008\nwhat are some things that we\nshould consider when it comes to?\n\n595\n00:29:32.008 --> 00:29:35.560\nI've got a box of tapes here,\nwhat do I do with them?\n\n596\n00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.701\n&gt;&gt; All right, first off any time you do\nbackups we need to have a backup procedure\n\n597\n00:29:39.701 --> 00:29:43.130\nand it needs to involve things\nlike labeling the backups.\n\n598\n00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:45.580\nIf you get a tape robot, every tape\ngets a bar code stuck on it, and\n\n599\n00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:49.260\nthe system tracks it all based on the bar\ncode, and it doesn't spill my coffee.\n\n600\n00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.850\nSo check all that based on bar code.\n\n601\n00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:52.470\nIf you're doing it by hand, though,\n\n602\n00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:55.730\nthen you're probably gona stick\na label on it with a date.\n\n603\n00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.830\nAnd if it's part of a backup series,\nlike a full followed by incrementals or\n\n604\n00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:01.550\nwhatever, you'll usually have\na series number on there, so\n\n605\n00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:02.730\nyou can track what it is.\n\n606\n00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:05.200\nIf I've got five incrementals,\nwhich one was the first one,\n\n607\n00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.150\nwhich one was the second one,\nwhich one was the third one?\n\n608\n00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:09.060\nAt a minimum, we put a date and\na time on there, but\n\n609\n00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:10.540\nyou'll need to track that sequence too.\n\n610\n00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.140\nThat needs to go on a label, and\n\n611\n00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.900\nbe stuffed on the tape,\nnow you'll reuse that tape over time.\n\n612\n00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.090\nWhen that backup ages out,\nyou'll go to reuse that tape.\n\n613\n00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:22.650\nAnd most tape labels either have\nwhere you can rip the label off or\n\n614\n00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:25.460\nyou just stick a new label right on top\nof it cuz it'll be recessed a bit so\n\n615\n00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.360\nyou can have stacks of labels.\n\n616\n00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:32.340\nEvery so often, the tapes go bad, and\nso you need to write on the label when\n\n617\n00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:36.820\nthe tape was first used so\nthat you can cycle it out and replace it.\n\n618\n00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.295\nUsually I don't like to trust\ntapes beyond a year, so\n\n619\n00:30:39.295 --> 00:30:42.870\nin every year you'll replace them,\nsome go longer, some go less.\n\n620\n00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:45.920\nYou'll get cleaning cartridges that go\ninto the tape drives to clean out the tape\n\n621\n00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.580\ndrives too, and those can only be\nused a certain amount of times.\n\n622\n00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.620\nThey usually have a sticker\non them with little x marks.\n\n623\n00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.350\nYou can track how many times\nthe cleaning tape has been used.\n\n624\n00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:58.520\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, an emergency has\nhappened, I got my tape, put that tape in,\n\n625\n00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.680\ngo to restore my systems, and I realize\nsomething's wrong with that tape.\n\n626\n00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.800\nHow could I have solved that problem or\nmaybe, remedied that problem beforehand?\n\n627\n00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:11.320\n&gt;&gt; I've been there and\nit's not a fun place,\n\n628\n00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:15.690\nI had a former student call me, this was\nyears ago, where they're trying to restore\n\n629\n00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:18.170\na backup for their company and\nit wasn't working and they needed my help.\n\n630\n00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:21.395\nAnd I came out there and\ntheir backups had been set up incorrectly.\n\n631\n00:31:21.395 --> 00:31:26.280\nThey'd been set up incorrectly since day\none, and I went through, it was like 30 or\n\n632\n00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.540\n40 different backup tapes, trying to find\nthe day that he was looking for it, and\n\n633\n00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:30.990\nit wasn't on any of them.\n\n634\n00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:34.280\nThey had never tested the backups,\na lot of people do backups and\n\n635\n00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.480\nnever test a restore.\n\n636\n00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.730\nYou need to test restore,\ngrab the tape, take a server offline,\n\n637\n00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.130\nwhatever, try and do the restore.\n\n638\n00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.130\nCan you restore your data?\n\n639\n00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:43.750\nIf you've never tried\nto restore your data,\n\n640\n00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:46.300\nyou don't know if you're backing up the\nright data and you definitely don't have\n\n641\n00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.350\ndocumented procedures on how to do the\nrestore if you've never done it, right.\n\n642\n00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:52.558\nSo you need to do it at least once anyway\nto get the documentation written up.\n\n643\n00:31:52.558 --> 00:31:56.392\nOn top of that, tapes go bad,\nthey're magnetic, discs go bad,\n\n644\n00:31:56.392 --> 00:32:00.741\nthey have moving parts, or SSD go bad\nif they write to them too many times.\n\n645\n00:32:00.741 --> 00:32:03.375\nSo all of these things go bad eventually.\n\n646\n00:32:03.375 --> 00:32:05.446\nSo you need to be testing, verifying.\n\n647\n00:32:05.446 --> 00:32:09.129\nMost backup software, like Arc Serve,\nSemantic Backup Exec, Comvault,\n\n648\n00:32:09.129 --> 00:32:12.811\nthey support backing up to a media, and\nthen doing a verification where they\n\n649\n00:32:12.811 --> 00:32:16.145\ncompare the bits that you backed up\nto the bits on the actual storage,\n\n650\n00:32:16.145 --> 00:32:20.520\nto make sure they match and that things\ndidn't get corrupted while being written.\n\n651\n00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.390\nYou need to do that.\n\n652\n00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:22.110\nIt takes a long time.\n\n653\n00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:24.290\nIt'll make your backup take twice as long.\n\n654\n00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:26.760\nIf I have a backup that takes three\nhours and I turn verification on,\n\n655\n00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:31.490\nit now takes six hours, but it's worth it,\ncuz I'll know that backup was good.\n\n656\n00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:34.550\nOtherwise I would have to test\nevery single backup that I do, and\n\n657\n00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:36.090\nwe just don't have time for that.\n\n658\n00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:39.310\nWell, in a mission critical environment\nyou may, and you'll have dedicated backup\n\n659\n00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:42.881\nadministrators that just do that, that's\ntheir only job is running the backups.\n\n660\n00:32:42.881 --> 00:32:46.142\nCuz it's that important,\nit is really a critical thing to have.\n\n661\n00:32:46.142 --> 00:32:49.517\nSo we always want to make\nsure we test our integrity,\n\n662\n00:32:49.517 --> 00:32:52.750\nthat files are written in their original\nform, they didn't get corrupted.\n\n663\n00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:54.960\nWe want to verify we can do our restores,\n\n664\n00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.950\nmake sure we're actually able to\nrestore that and get it in place.\n\n665\n00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:02.490\nAnd we need to make sure that we're\ntracking our rotation and retention.\n\n666\n00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:05.840\nThat we're rotating through tapes to\nmake sure that we have even usage across\n\n667\n00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.720\nthe tapes, and that we're\nmaintaining data to a certain age.\n\n668\n00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.250\nIf I want to maintain six months of data,\n\n669\n00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:15.480\nthe tape I'm reusing today should have\ndata on it that's over six months old.\n\n670\n00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.030\nI don't want to use something that\nonly has two months old data on it,\n\n671\n00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:20.090\nbecause that's too new,\nI need to retain that.\n\n672\n00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:21.950\nSo we need to rotate through our tapes,\nand\n\n673\n00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:24.330\nmake sure we're retaining whatever\nthe window of time is we need.\n\n674\n00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:26.600\nDifferent companies have\ndifferent retention needs.\n\n675\n00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.140\nIf you don't have any, you might just\nmake your own up and say all right well,\n\n676\n00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.430\nI'm going to maintain one a day for\nthe last two weeks.\n\n677\n00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:34.640\nAnd then one a week for\nthe next four weeks.\n\n678\n00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.810\nAnd then one a month for\nthe last six months.\n\n679\n00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:39.930\nAnd that way I can restore\nanything up til six months ago.\n\n680\n00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:42.170\nOver six months,\ncan't restore it, it's gone.\n\n681\n00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:46.090\nYou gotta draw a line somewhere,\notherwise you have to buy a ton of tapes.\n\n682\n00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:47.390\nBut that's all stuff that\nwe need to think about.\n\n683\n00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:52.250\nAnd then lastly, backups are great, and\nthey'll save you from a lot of trouble.\n\n684\n00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:55.910\nA lot of software trouble,\nhardware trouble on a single server.\n\n685\n00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:59.150\nBut if you have a full data\ncenter destruction event, right,\n\n686\n00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:03.050\na massive disaster,\nyou're gonna lose your facility.\n\n687\n00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:05.790\nAnd if you lose your facility\nyou might lose your tapes also.\n\n688\n00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:10.730\nSo you want to make sure your store\nyour tapes somewhere that plans for\n\n689\n00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:11.750\nthe disaster, right.\n\n690\n00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.470\nYou might have a fire proof\nsafe in your data center, so\n\n691\n00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:16.780\nif your data center burns down,\nyou'll have tapes right there.\n\n692\n00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.520\nBut tapes cook pretty well\neven in a fire proof safe, so\n\n693\n00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.630\nthat's not normally a guarantee.\n\n694\n00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:24.478\nWe want to make sure that they're\nstored off site somewhere.\n\n695\n00:34:24.478 --> 00:34:27.270\nAnd you gotta be really careful with off\nsite backups because if somebody gets\n\n696\n00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:28.770\na hold of your backup, what do they have?\n\n697\n00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:30.080\nAll of your data.\n\n698\n00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.990\nSo usually we encrypt the backups,\nthat helps with that, but\n\n699\n00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:34.650\nits better to use a secure service.\n\n700\n00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:36.335\nI mentioned Iron Mountain,\nthey are just one example,\n\n701\n00:34:36.335 --> 00:34:37.960\nthere's plenty of companies\nout there that do it.\n\n702\n00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.860\nThat they have certified technicians that\ncome to your building, pick up the tapes,\n\n703\n00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:45.050\nthey take custody, and then they go and\nthey lock it in a vault, and\n\n704\n00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:47.130\nno one has access to the vault but\nIron Mountain.\n\n705\n00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:49.180\nAnd when you need a tape back,\nyou call them, and\n\n706\n00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:50.970\nthey withdraw it from the vault and\nbring it to you.\n\n707\n00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:55.170\nYou never even get to see the vault,\nit's all off site and secured.\n\n708\n00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.120\nYou trust them to store that data.\n\n709\n00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.760\nIf you decide to do it yourself,\n\n710\n00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.180\nmake sure you got a location\nyou can trust, all right?\n\n711\n00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.290\nDon't just throw it in\nthe trunk of your car.\n\n712\n00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:04.430\nWhat happens when your car gets stolen?\n\n713\n00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:06.690\nYour backup just got stolen.\n\n714\n00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:08.160\nYou don't want that to happen, right?\n\n715\n00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.480\nSo it needs to be stored\nsecurely somewhere.\n\n716\n00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:15.010\nIt's okay to have onsite backups, but\nyou also want to have offsite, right?\n\n717\n00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:17.370\nYour offsite backup might not\nbe as timely as your onsite.\n\n718\n00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:21.310\nMaybe it's a few days old versus\none that was taken an hour ago.\n\n719\n00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:23.460\nBut you do want to have at\nleast one backup offsite so\n\n720\n00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.830\nthat you can recover something in\nthe event of a total disaster.\n\n721\n00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:29.740\nAnd it all comes down to how much\ndata you can afford to lose.\n\n722\n00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.270\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don.\n\n723\n00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:32.220\nA lot of great information\nwhen it comes to backup.\n\n724\n00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.330\nA lot of things that we\nhave to consider for sure.\n\n725\n00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:38.056\nBut one thing our tape is not going to\nrestore are the minutes on the clock.\n\n726\n00:35:38.056 --> 00:35:40.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So before we do sign out here,\n\n727\n00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.550\ndo you have any additional words\non such an important topic?\n\n728\n00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:44.600\n&gt;&gt; The only the other things is on tapes,\n\n729\n00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.210\nwe do have to worry about\nenvironmental conditions.\n\n730\n00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:49.270\nThat tapes are magnetic, and so\nif they're exposed to magnetic fields or\n\n731\n00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:53.720\nelectrical current, if they're exposed\nto even drops over three feet or\n\n732\n00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.180\nshaken, the tapes can lose tension.\n\n733\n00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:00.130\nSo tapes are actually not that hard\nto damage if you manhandle them.\n\n734\n00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:03.690\nMost of us will get a case that has nice\nfoam little dividers in it where you can\n\n735\n00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:06.170\nstore tapes, and they'll be nice and\nsecure, even if it gets beat up and\n\n736\n00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.670\nthrown around.\n\n737\n00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:09.147\nIf you're storing off site,\nalways keep that in mind,\n\n738\n00:36:09.147 --> 00:36:11.162\nthe environmental conditions of that tape.\n\n739\n00:36:11.162 --> 00:36:13.403\nYou don't want to melt them or\nexpose them to magnets.\n\n740\n00:36:13.403 --> 00:36:15.300\nThey need to maintain your data.\n\n741\n00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:15.974\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don.\n\n742\n00:36:15.974 --> 00:36:19.288\nWealth of information, thank you for\nbeing here in the studios with us and\n\n743\n00:36:19.288 --> 00:36:21.008\nthank you to you the viewer watching.\n\n744\n00:36:21.008 --> 00:36:23.600\nSigning out for

00:00:08.291\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:12.150\nYou're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.570\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.903\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:15.903 --> 00:00:17.196\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:17.196 --> 00:00:21.209\nwe're continuing through our\nCompTIA Server+ SK0-004 certification.\n\n9\n00:00:21.209 --> 00:00:25.340\nAnd joining us in the studio today\nis none other than Mister Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.380\nDon, how are you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.971\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n12\n00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:28.949\nLet's start to dive right back\ninto the world of Server+.\n\n13\n00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.970\nAnd we're starting a new objective on this\nand we're moving into troubleshooting.\n\n14\n00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.340\nAnd we have got a ton\nof stuff to talk about.\n\n15\n00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.590\nWe're gonna break things down by area and\ntalk about hardware troubleshooting, and\n\n16\n00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.050\nsoftware, and network, and\n\n17\n00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.225\nall the different areas where we might\nhave problems and have to troubleshoot.\n\n18\n00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:47.526\nBu,t we're gonna start out with a little\nbit of fundamentals and theory, and\n\n19\n00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:48.687\nthis is kind of important.\n\n20\n00:00:48.687 --> 00:00:51.993\nIt's important in real life and\nit's really important on the exam,\n\n21\n00:00:51.993 --> 00:00:56.160\nbecause CompTIA has a approved methodology\nfor how we should troubleshoot a problem.\n\n22\n00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.911\nThere's basically eight steps\nthat we should be going\n\n23\n00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:01.791\nthrough with any problem and\nnot just troubleshooting.\n\n24\n00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:03.820\nIt's actually moving\nthrough to the resolution.\n\n25\n00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.030\nSo, it's actually kinda like the whole\nlifecycle of a service ticket.\n\n26\n00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.320\nAnd it makes a lot of sense,\nthese eight steps, that if you don't have\n\n27\n00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.440\na troubleshooting methodology of your own,\nthis is a great one to adopt.\n\n28\n00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.130\nIf you've already got one, you likely\nincorporating these various steps.\n\n29\n00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.720\nYou might have eight\ndistinct separate steps.\n\n30\n00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.775\nYou might be blending several together or\neven skipping in some scenarios and\n\n31\n00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:24.720\nthat's fine, right?\n\n32\n00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.140\nYour way is not bad.\n\n33\n00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.340\nTheir way is not better necessarily.\n\n34\n00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.960\nIt's just, they have to establish\nsomething and this is kind of a tried and\n\n35\n00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.810\ntrue methodology that we've seen.\n\n36\n00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.200\nIf you've done your A+, Net Plus, or\nyou've probably seen this methodology\n\n37\n00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.480\nbefore, but\nif this is your first exposure to CompTIA,\n\n38\n00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.810\nwell this is a methodology\nyou need to be familiar with.\n\n39\n00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.230\nSo, that's what we're gonna move\nthrough right here in this episode,\n\n40\n00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.660\nis looking at each of the steps for\nwhen we have a problem.\n\n41\n00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.580\nSo, let's kick it off.\n\n42\n00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.670\nI've got a little, I usually hate\nto do text slides like these, but\n\n43\n00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.230\nthis is one where I don't\nreally have a choice.\n\n44\n00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.780\nWe just have eight steps to talk about.\n\n45\n00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.530\nAnd we'll start right here with step\nnumber one, which is determine the scope.\n\n46\n00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.170\nNow, if you think about a problem that\nyou're having on a server, or a network,\n\n47\n00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.700\nor whatever, what does it start with?\n\n48\n00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.130\nIt starts with somebody or\n\n49\n00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.340\nsome monitoring system coming to you and\ntelling you there's a problem, right.\n\n50\n00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.600\nHopefully, it's a monitoring system.\n\n51\n00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.520\nHopefully, it's you\nseeing the problem first.\n\n52\n00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.120\nBut sometimes, it's an end user.\n\n53\n00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.440\nAnd the end user calls up the help desk or\ncalls you directly if\n\n54\n00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.460\nthey've unfortunately gotten\na hold of your phone number.\n\n55\n00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.420\nAnd they call you and\n\n56\n00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.340\nthey say hey I can't check my email,\nor somebody sent me an email and\n\n57\n00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.330\nI haven't received it, or I'm trying\nto access a server and I can't connect.\n\n58\n00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.880\nThat server is running slow today,\nwhat's going on?\n\n59\n00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.460\nThey give you some kind of\nreport like that, okay.\n\n60\n00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.390\nSo that's really where things initiate,\nthat's where they start.\n\n61\n00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.090\nAnd that's what kicks off a process\nof you needing to troubleshoot.\n\n62\n00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.600\nAnd step one is establish the scope.\n\n63\n00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.350\nNow by scope,\nwhat we really mean is what systems and\n\n64\n00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.050\nwhat people are affected by the problem,\nright?\n\n65\n00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.030\nIf somebody calls me up and says hey,\nI can't get to that server.\n\n66\n00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.670\nIt could be a problem on the server.\n\n67\n00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.520\nAnd if it's a problem on the server,\n\n68\n00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.650\nevery user who accesses that\nserver could be affected.\n\n69\n00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.890\nThat's a pretty big scope.\n\n70\n00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.240\nOr the person who called in,\nmaybe their network cable's unplugged.\n\n71\n00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.170\nAnd so yeah, they can't connect to\nthe server, but everybody else can.\n\n72\n00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.960\nNow, it's more than likely\na problem on their machine,\n\n73\n00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.460\ntheir network cable became unplugged.\n\n74\n00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.600\nNow the scope is very small,\nit's only affected one user.\n\n75\n00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.160\nBut establishing the scope helps\nus to figure out where to look.\n\n76\n00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.530\nIf I've got 10,000 users, and\nonly one person is complaining,\n\n77\n00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.070\nI probably shouldn't spend a lot of\ntime troubleshooting on the server,\n\n78\n00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.350\nbecause the problem is more\nthan likely not on the server.\n\n79\n00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.170\nThe problem is more than likely on their\nend, or on a network device in between.\n\n80\n00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.580\nBut even on a network device in between,\n\n81\n00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.830\nyou would still have more\nthan one user affected.\n\n82\n00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.560\nMaybe, everyone in the sales\ndepartment Is complaining, but\n\n83\n00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.870\neveryone in the marketing\ndepartment is fine.\n\n84\n00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.900\nOr everybody in accounting is fine.\n\n85\n00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.810\nMaybe it's users on the third floor\nare experiencing a problem, but\n\n86\n00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.270\non the fourth and\nfifth floors everything's fine.\n\n87\n00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.380\nMaybe it's users in Australia aren't able\nto connect, but users in Europe can.\n\n88\n00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.150\nRight.\nThis helps us to establish a scope,\n\n89\n00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.310\nand helps point us in the right direction\nof finding where the problem is.\n\n90\n00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.440\nSo, how do we go about\nestablishing a scope?\n\n91\n00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.410\nWell, we use the most important skill that\nwe have as an IT professional: we listen.\n\n92\n00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.460\nWe listen to what the user is telling us,\nor customer,\n\n93\n00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.470\nor end-user,\nwhoever it is that's telling us.\n\n94\n00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.350\nIf you are tier two or\ntier three tech support,\n\n95\n00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.730\nIt will be whatever the tier one person is\ntelling you, whoever took the phone call,\n\n96\n00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.120\nwho received the email ticket and\nis now relaying the information to you.\n\n97\n00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.000\nYou listen.\n\n98\n00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.420\nListen to what they have to say and\n\n99\n00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.010\nthey'll tell you about the problem\nthat they're witnessing.\n\n100\n00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.990\nAnd what they're seeing are symptoms,\nright?\n\n101\n00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.850\nWe'll get to the whole cause\na little bit later on.\n\n102\n00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.800\nBut, they're going to tell you\nthe symptoms that they're experiencing.\n\n103\n00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.770\nAnd now we have to diagnose that so\n\n104\n00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.110\nwe need to find out how\nbig of an issue this is.\n\n105\n00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.660\nAnd the bigger the issue is,\n\n106\n00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.040\nthe more people affected, the more\nlikely the problem is on our servers.\n\n107\n00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.166\nThe less people affected, the more\nlikely the problem is on their end.\n\n108\n00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:12.224\n&gt;&gt; Don, one of the things that I've\nwondered, in the first step here,\n\n109\n00:05:12.224 --> 00:05:15.968\nhow did you, and I know you've worked in\ndata centers, I know you've worked on many\n\n110\n00:05:15.968 --> 00:05:19.110\nnetworks, supported many users,\nhow do you determine the urgency?\n\n111\n00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.890\nBecause, we know with end users, if I\ncan't turn my computer on, it's urgent.\n\n112\n00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.290\nIf I can't receive an email it's urgent.\n\n113\n00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.240\nHow do you determine the urgency\nas part of scoping it out?\n\n114\n00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, we did our\ndisaster recovery episodes, right?\n\n115\n00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.760\nHopefully you guys watched those already.\n\n116\n00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.430\nAnd in the disaster recovery episodes, we\ntalk about the business impact analysis.\n\n117\n00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.890\nAnd how there were certain servers that\nmight be considered mission critical.\n\n118\n00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.150\nOr there are certain servers were if they\ngo offline, we start losing money, right.\n\n119\n00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.060\nPeople aren't able to do their work.\n\n120\n00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.710\nThose are gonna be servers\nwith a high criticality right?\n\n121\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.580\nThat we really need to\nget them back online and\n\n122\n00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.440\nthat's a mission critical system.\n\n123\n00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.040\nRight?\nHigh priority.\n\n124\n00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.930\nBut there's other systems that\nthe business impact analysis should've\n\n125\n00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.030\nrevealed or your business resumption plan\nshould reveal if you've already got one,\n\n126\n00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.620\nthat tells you, hey,\nthis is not a mission critical server.\n\n127\n00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.480\nAnd so, if its services go offline,\nthat's okay.\n\n128\n00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.340\nIt's not critical.\n\n129\n00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.800\nWe have a bigger window of\ntime to bring it back online.\n\n130\n00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.570\nAnd so, that's what you use to gauge\nyour priority in a normal world, right?\n\n131\n00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.920\nBut there's this one other factor\nthat doesn't come into play there,\n\n132\n00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.270\nwhich is authority.\n\n133\n00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.340\nThat the CEO calls down, and she says,\nhey, I can't get into my email.\n\n134\n00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.750\nEmail might not be a critical service for\n\n135\n00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.250\nyou, but\nthe CEO is a critical employee for you.\n\n136\n00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.130\nAnd so now, you're gonna do whatever you\ncan to get that system back online or\n\n137\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.280\nresolve their issue.\n\n138\n00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.740\nSo, there's always political\nfactors that phase into all this.\n\n139\n00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.710\nBut, from a technical standpoint,\nyour business presumption plan tells you\n\n140\n00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.250\nwhat's critical and what's not,\nwhat you should be applying priority to.\n\n141\n00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.670\nBut you can always ask, you can ask\nthe people that you're talking to,\n\n142\n00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.700\npeople you're getting tickets from, that\nyou have what are called stakeholders.\n\n143\n00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.710\nAnytime you have a project and\na ticket, like a service ticket,\n\n144\n00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.010\nit's technically a project.\n\n145\n00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.720\nThat you have people\nwho are effected by it.\n\n146\n00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.230\nPeople who have a vested interest in\nthe success in that ticket, and so\n\n147\n00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.020\nyou can ask them for more information.\n\n148\n00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.220\nYou're gathering data, right?\n\n149\n00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.570\nThat's what we're doing at this stage,\nis we establish the scope,\n\n150\n00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.240\nwe're collecting documentation and\nother information.\n\n151\n00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.990\nWe're bringing all of that in to us so\n\n152\n00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.140\nthat we can now use it to try and\ncome up with the solution.\n\n153\n00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.710\nAnd that's really what step two is.\n\n154\n00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.340\nWhen we get to step two,\nthat established a theory right?\n\n155\n00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.575\nSo step one, determine the scope and\nthen step two, establish a theory.\n\n156\n00:07:26.575 --> 00:07:29.020\nBased on the information\nwe've got from the people,\n\n157\n00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.890\nand the amount of people affected,\nwe can come up with a theory.\n\n158\n00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.840\nIf only the third floor is having\na problem contacting my server, but\n\n159\n00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.130\nthe first and second floor is okay,\nthe fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh floors,\n\n160\n00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:40.660\nthey're all okay.\n\n161\n00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.570\nIt's just the third floor.\n\n162\n00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.640\nI'm gonna have a theory.\n\n163\n00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.880\nMy theory is, there's something wrong with\nthe networking gear on the third floor.\n\n164\n00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.570\nRight?\nIt's gonna have a fiber uplink or\n\n165\n00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.820\nwhatever that connects\nback to our data center.\n\n166\n00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.175\nThere's more than likely an issue there.\n\n167\n00:07:53.175 --> 00:07:55.116\nRight.\nI can establish that idea,\n\n168\n00:07:55.116 --> 00:07:59.341\nbecause of the information I got,\nthe scope I established.\n\n169\n00:07:59.341 --> 00:08:00.952\nSo now I come up with a theory.\n\n170\n00:08:00.952 --> 00:08:03.535\nMy theory is,\nmaybe the fiber link is down.\n\n171\n00:08:03.535 --> 00:08:05.191\nI need to go and find out.\n\n172\n00:08:05.191 --> 00:08:08.940\nI need to gather information and\nthen go and find out.\n\n173\n00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.720\nThere's other devices that\ncould be causing a problem.\n\n174\n00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.340\nI could access control lists.\n\n175\n00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.220\nI could say,\n\n176\n00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.150\nwell I wonder if there have been any\nchanges implemented recently, right.\n\n177\n00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.930\nThe first problem report came\nin at 9 a.m this morning.\n\n178\n00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.910\nLet me go see if any tickets were\ncompleted between 8 and 9 a.m..\n\n179\n00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.300\nRight, maybe right prior to that,\nsomething was done.\n\n180\n00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.930\nSo I gather documentation, I go and I look\nfor service tickets that were completed,\n\n181\n00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:35.360\nI look for change requests that were\napproved and implemented in that window.\n\n182\n00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.492\nI'm looking for that documentation,\nso I can build my theory.\n\n183\n00:08:38.492 --> 00:08:41.919\nAnd then step 3 is, we test the theory.\n\n184\n00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:44.453\nNow testing the theory Is tough,\n\n185\n00:08:44.453 --> 00:08:49.290\nbecause technically we don't\nwanna change our network.\n\n186\n00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.880\nIf you change the network,\nyou've gotta do a change ticket.\n\n187\n00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.580\nYou've gotta get that approved, you can't\nchange the network just willy nilly.\n\n188\n00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.190\nHere we're testing the theory.\n\n189\n00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:03.050\nIf I think the fiber link is down,\nis there a way I can verify the fiber\n\n190\n00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.830\nlink is down without actually\nchanging the fiber link?\n\n191\n00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.740\nAbsolutely.\nI can get out of my chair, I can walk over\n\n192\n00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:13.520\nto that server closet or networking\ncloset, the MDF or SDF, or whatever it is.\n\n193\n00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.840\nAnd I can look, and is there a little\nlink light on the fiber cable?\n\n194\n00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.610\nYes.\n\n195\n00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.650\nWell, I got a link light.\n\n196\n00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.620\nOr no, no link light,\nmy theory's looking pretty good, right?\n\n197\n00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.740\nAnd that's what step 3 is all about,\ntesting that theory.\n\n198\n00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.600\nMaking sure you find\nout whether it's right.\n\n199\n00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.180\nCan I ping across that line?\n\n200\n00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.320\nCan I ping other hosts on that line?\n\n201\n00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.980\nWhat can I communicate, right?\n\n202\n00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.640\nAnd if it's a server, can I connect to it?\n\n203\n00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.100\nCan I connect to it on this\nport versus another port?\n\n204\n00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.340\nCan I VNC or remote desktop, SSH into it?\n\n205\n00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.740\nIs the server even powered\non in the first place?\n\n206\n00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.510\nThese are all things that we can check\nwithout actually changing the system.\n\n207\n00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.100\nYou're testing your theory.\n\n208\n00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.570\nAnd what you might find is, hey,\nI thought the fiber link was down, but\n\n209\n00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.640\nI can ping across it just fine.\n\n210\n00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.850\nSo that's not it.\n\n211\n00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.600\nI can throw that theory out the window.\n\n212\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.200\nLet's move onto the next theory.\n\n213\n00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.940\nMaybe the problem is with routing,\nmaybe it's in ACL.\n\n214\n00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.470\nAnd I can go and start to verify that.\n\n215\n00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.800\nBut not changing the network.\n\n216\n00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:12.590\nAnd as we test, eventually we come\nup with the theory and we test it.\n\n217\n00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.240\nAnd the theory is right.\n\n218\n00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.075\nOkay, I can't ping across that fiber link.\n\n219\n00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:19.370\nI do have an issue here, right.\n\n220\n00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.690\nNow we're ready to move to step 4.\n\n221\n00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.090\nAnd step 4 is establish a plan of action.\n\n222\n00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.580\nNow that I know the fiber link is down,\nwhat do I wanna do to fix it?\n\n223\n00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.550\nHow can I fix that, right?\n\n224\n00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:31.730\nDo I need to replace the cable?\n\n225\n00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.530\nDo I need to have it re-terminated?\n\n226\n00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.700\nDo I need to replace a switch?\n\n227\n00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.679\nWhat is it that I wanna do?\n\n228\n00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:40.210\nAnd now is when we're talking\nabout changing the network.\n\n229\n00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.090\nBut we're not actually changing it.\n\n230\n00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.610\nWhat we're doing now, is filling out\nour change ticket, our change request.\n\n231\n00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.970\nAnd saying,\nhere is the change I wanna make.\n\n232\n00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.440\nThis is why I'm doing it,\nbecause there's an outage.\n\n233\n00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.010\nThis is how I think it will fix it.\n\n234\n00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.370\nHere's how we can undo\nthe change if it doesn't fix it.\n\n235\n00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:55.270\nNow, that's important.\n\n236\n00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.760\nThat's a lesson I learned very\nearly on in my IT career.\n\n237\n00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:03.330\nIs, I worked with a guy, who,\nyou'd present him with a problem.\n\n238\n00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:07.490\nAnd he would go and\nmake five changes and fix the problem.\n\n239\n00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.060\nWell, which of the five changes fixed it?\n\n240\n00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.650\nHe wouldn't know and\nhe'd leave them all in there, right?\n\n241\n00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.780\nBut turns out maybe it would just\nchange number 3 to fix the problem.\n\n242\n00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.010\nSo change number 1, 2,\n4 and 5, what do they do?\n\n243\n00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.970\nMaybe they weakened security, maybe they\nchanged settings that didn't need to be\n\n244\n00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.490\nchanged and broke something else,\nmaybe they've just given me a non-standard\n\n245\n00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:30.520\nconfiguration that's gonna cost problems\nyears down the road, we don't know.\n\n246\n00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.555\nAnd that's why you make one change and one\nchange only and you make sure it worked.\n\n247\n00:11:34.555 --> 00:11:37.231\nAnd if it didn't, you undo the change and\nthen you make your second change.\n\n248\n00:11:37.231 --> 00:11:41.352\nAnd if it doesn't work you undo it and\nyou make your third one.\n\n249\n00:11:41.352 --> 00:11:43.610\nAnd that's why we need to\nhave steps in there for\n\n250\n00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.600\nhow we undo the changes we've made.\n\n251\n00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.530\nAlso if the whole network breaks at that\npoint, right, we've really caused some\n\n252\n00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.130\ntrouble that we know what to do to\nundo that change and roll it back.\n\n253\n00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.830\nOnce our change ticket is approved,\nwe move to step 5.\n\n254\n00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.780\nAnd step 5 is implementing the solution,\nright?\n\n255\n00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.820\nWe take whatever it is that we\njust figured out and we go and\n\n256\n00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.190\nwe implement it, right?\n\n257\n00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.790\nWe put the change in place.\n\n258\n00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.080\nIt's one of the easier steps.\n\n259\n00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:11.940\nYou come up with a plan, you make the one\nchange, and then you move to step 6.\n\n260\n00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.505\nVerify a full system functionality.\n\n261\n00:12:14.505 --> 00:12:16.040\n&gt;&gt; Don, I've got a question.\n\n262\n00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.878\nWhere do backups come into play here\nbecause I know that one of the things\n\n263\n00:12:18.878 --> 00:12:21.150\nyou've always stressed is\nyou're gonna make a change,\n\n264\n00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.020\nyou've got to make sure\nyou've got a backup.\n\n265\n00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.295\nNow, that could have been a plan to\nrollback, I missed that one there.\n\n266\n00:12:25.295 --> 00:12:27.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, so\n\n267\n00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.480\nthere's differences of\nopinions on this one.\n\n268\n00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.890\nAccording to CompTIA, you should be\ntaking your backup way back in Step 1,\n\n269\n00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.170\ndetermine the skill.\n\n270\n00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.320\nRemember when I mentioned\ngathering your documentation,\n\n271\n00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.750\nright, well they're saying is how\nyou've got a problem on your network,\n\n272\n00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:45.370\nwho knows how bad it's gonna get,\nit might get worse, take your backups now.\n\n273\n00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.960\nTake a backup of all the systems\nright now while you still can,\n\n274\n00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.980\nin case things get worse, right?\n\n275\n00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.940\nBut at a minimum, you need to\ndo it before you get to step 5,\n\n276\n00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.650\nbefore you implement the solution.\n\n277\n00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:01.400\nCuz what if implementing your\nsolution really causes a problem?\n\n278\n00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.490\nReally breaks things.\n\n279\n00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.970\nIt can happen, and\nmay be you're unable to roll back.\n\n280\n00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.880\nNow you're in a situation, right?\n\n281\n00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:12.040\nSo what we need to do is make sure that\nprior to step 5 we've taken backups.\n\n282\n00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.560\nOr some kind of rollback.\n\n283\n00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.990\nIf it's a virtual machine a lot of\ntimes you can just take a snapshot,\n\n284\n00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.040\nsuper easy, right?\n\n285\n00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.470\nEasy to roll back.\n\n286\n00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.420\nOther things you might test\nin a lab environment first.\n\n287\n00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.120\nThat maybe they can't be\nrolled back very well.\n\n288\n00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.140\nSo you test them in a lab environment\nto make sure it's all fine\n\n289\n00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.210\nbefore you then go and roll it\nforward in a production environment.\n\n290\n00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.050\nSo, there's different kind of methods for\nhow you wanna go about that.\n\n291\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:35.210\nAll right, once that's done.\n\n292\n00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.480\nWe implement our solution and\nwe verify full system functionality.\n\n293\n00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.720\nNow notice the wording\nthat CompTIA uses there.\n\n294\n00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.920\nVerify full system functionality.\n\n295\n00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.750\nDon't verify that you\njust fixed the problem,\n\n296\n00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:52.460\nbecause sometimes fixing one\nproblem can break other things.\n\n297\n00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:59.080\nIn the testing world,\nthey have terms like stories and CI and\n\n298\n00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.310\nall the different things that they talk\nabout where, when you roll out a change\n\n299\n00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:09.010\nlike this, your company has several\ndifferent ways that they use the systems.\n\n300\n00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.550\nDo all those ways still work, right?\n\n301\n00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.690\nI made a file server and\n\n302\n00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:17.340\nthe user is reporting that they\ncan't connect to the file server.\n\n303\n00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.630\nAnd it turns out that some protocol's not\nworking right, so I reset the protocol.\n\n304\n00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:21.810\nNow that user can connect.\n\n305\n00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.260\nGreat, but\n\n306\n00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.470\nthere may be other systems in my company\nthat relied on that protocol also.\n\n307\n00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:30.840\nWhen I reset the protocol, maybe I lost\nsome configuration changes because I reset\n\n308\n00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.640\nit, right, and\nnow the other people can't connect.\n\n309\n00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.619\nWe see that, when people use the NSH\ncommand to reset interfaces, and\n\n310\n00:14:36.619 --> 00:14:38.400\nit will reset things like IPsec tunnels.\n\n311\n00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.565\nAnd so now, yes, your regular\nuser might be able to connect but\n\n312\n00:14:41.565 --> 00:14:46.260\nyour IPsec tunnels don't work to connect\nto that system for file access anymore.\n\n313\n00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.310\nIt's broken.\n\n314\n00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.880\nI fixed one person's problem,\nand I broke somebody else's.\n\n315\n00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.350\nSo when we take a look at\na server to verify functionality.\n\n316\n00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.590\nWe need to verify we fixed\nthe problem we were targeting.\n\n317\n00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.450\nAnd everybody else.\n\n318\n00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.298\nThe stuff we weren't targeting\nis still functional.\n\n319\n00:15:00.298 --> 00:15:03.080\nWe never wanna make the server worse\nthan it was when we started on it.\n\n320\n00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:03.910\nBut it does happen.\n\n321\n00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.430\nWe've gotta check for that.\n\n322\n00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:08.910\nAnd if it does, if we made it worse,\nwe roll back, right.\n\n323\n00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.238\nThis is the step where we decide that.\n\n324\n00:15:10.238 --> 00:15:13.390\nIn step 6, if we didn't fix the problem,\nwe roll back.\n\n325\n00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.370\nAnd so what will happen,\nif we look at the list again.\n\n326\n00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.220\nIs that we came up with a theory.\n\n327\n00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.670\nWe test the theory.\n\n328\n00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.438\nAnd if that theory didn't work out,\nwe go back to step 2,\n\n329\n00:15:23.438 --> 00:15:24.800\nwe come up with a new theory.\n\n330\n00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.290\nAnd we go to step 3 to test it.\n\n331\n00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:30.000\nSo you might bounce back and forth\nbetween step 2 and 3 quite a few times.\n\n332\n00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.830\nThe same thing happens with 4, 5, and 6.\n\n333\n00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.510\nWe come up with a plan.\n\n334\n00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:38.280\nWe implement the plan and\nwe verify the plan.\n\n335\n00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:42.220\nAnd if that didn't work,\nwe gotta go all the way back to step 4.\n\n336\n00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:47.770\nWe undo the plan, undo the change and\nthen we establish a new plan of action.\n\n337\n00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.010\nAnd we implement that solution and\nwe verify the plan.\n\n338\n00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:51.700\nIf that didn't, then we roll back,\nwe go back to step 4.\n\n339\n00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.560\nSo you might bounce back and\nfourth between these.\n\n340\n00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.954\nAnd if it gets really bad, you might\ngo to all the way back to step 2.\n\n341\n00:15:57.954 --> 00:16:00.651\nHey, I just tried five fixes and\nnone of them worked.\n\n342\n00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:01.581\nI'm really confused.\n\n343\n00:16:01.581 --> 00:16:04.448\nLet's go all the way back to step 2 and\ncome up with a new theory.\n\n344\n00:16:04.448 --> 00:16:06.712\nMaybe we've diagnosed this problem wrong.\n\n345\n00:16:06.712 --> 00:16:09.337\nAnd that's where I mentioned symptoms,\n\n346\n00:16:09.337 --> 00:16:14.670\nthat you might be trying to fix a symptom,\nand not understand what the cause is.\n\n347\n00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:18.100\nAnd, so you might temporary fix a symptom\nthat just comes right back again, and\n\n348\n00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.280\nthen that's not going to work for\nyou long term.\n\n349\n00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.920\nSo we've gotta make sure that we're\ndouble-checking that, and that we're\n\n350\n00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.190\nonly implementing changes that actually\nwork, that actually solve our problem.\n\n351\n00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.410\nNow, let's say we implement that\nchange and everything works great.\n\n352\n00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.720\nWe verify our full system functionality,\nlife is good.\n\n353\n00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.971\nWe're ready to party, right.\n\n354\n00:16:35.971 --> 00:16:37.827\nWell, then we need to\nmove on to step seven,\n\n355\n00:16:37.827 --> 00:16:40.200\nwhich is perform a root cause analysis.\n\n356\n00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.720\nWhy did the problem happen\nin the first place?\n\n357\n00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.290\nWhy did that fiber link to\nthe third floor go down?\n\n358\n00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.997\nMaybe a squirrel chewed through it, right,\n\n359\n00:16:47.997 --> 00:16:50.170\nthat's a popular one to\nblame it on these days.\n\n360\n00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.947\nOr maybe just the connectors got old or\nthe switch vibrated, and so\n\n361\n00:16:53.947 --> 00:16:57.430\nover time the little\nconnector worked its way out.\n\n362\n00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:58.070\nWho knows?\n\n363\n00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.210\nWe need to find out why.\n\n364\n00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.310\nWhy did that happen?\n\n365\n00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.500\nA lot of times you'll hear people,\nthey say, well, the server locked up so\n\n366\n00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.760\nI rebooted it, and now it's fine.\n\n367\n00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.540\nOkay, well, why did the server lock up?\n\n368\n00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.050\nYes, the reboot fixed it, right,\nI came up with a plan of action.\n\n369\n00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.810\nMy plan was reboot the server.\n\n370\n00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:14.960\nGood plan.\n\n371\n00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.470\nWe joke about it, but that actually is\na good plan, it usually works, right.\n\n372\n00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.820\nSo we reboot the server and it works.\n\n373\n00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.390\nI verify full system functionality.\n\n374\n00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:22.795\nEverybody's back in, everybody's happy.\n\n375\n00:17:22.795 --> 00:17:24.389\nI'm done.\n\n376\n00:17:24.389 --> 00:17:26.980\nWell, not really.\n\n377\n00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.060\nThe server locked up, that's a symptom.\n\n378\n00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.310\nI rebooted it, now it's happy again.\n\n379\n00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.530\nBut what was the cause?\n\n380\n00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.740\nWhat caused it to lock up?\n\n381\n00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.720\nWell, I need to find out because\nif I don't fix what caused it,\n\n382\n00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.150\nit could happen again.\n\n383\n00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.280\nNow, I had this happen, actually,\njust yesterday with my own laptop,\n\n384\n00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:49.010\nwhere I would launch Chrome and\nmy laptop would reboot, just miraculously.\n\n385\n00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:50.340\nAnd it took me a while to figure it out.\n\n386\n00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.080\nThe laptop would reboot and\nthen things seem fine.\n\n387\n00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.010\nWhen I got home,\neverything was working fine.\n\n388\n00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.150\nSo it was just when I was here in\nthe office, that was really weird.\n\n389\n00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.190\nWhen I'm in the office,\nif I launch Chrome, my laptop reboots.\n\n390\n00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:01.420\nWhat's up with that?\n\n391\n00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:05.120\nWell, in the office,\nI was using a USB network adapter.\n\n392\n00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.350\nAnd the driver for that network\nadapter was causing a problem.\n\n393\n00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:10.960\nAnd when I would launch Chrome,\nmy laptop would reboot.\n\n394\n00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.550\nWell, when I went home,\nI wasn't using that adapter.\n\n395\n00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.520\nI was on my wireless at home, and\nI could launch Chrome and it worked fine.\n\n396\n00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.650\nSo Chrome crashing, and\nthe laptop crashing, that was the symptom.\n\n397\n00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.270\nThe cause was the USB network driver.\n\n398\n00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:26.330\nAnd when I replaced that driver,\neverything started working fine.\n\n399\n00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.560\nBut had I not done that, I would've\ngone home and said, the problem's fine.\n\n400\n00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.720\nThe laptop's working great.\n\n401\n00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.150\nBut when I come back into the office,\nthe problem exists again, right.\n\n402\n00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:35.940\nSo you've gotta find out\nwhat that cause was,\n\n403\n00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.290\ndo a root cause analysis, so\nyou can prevent recurrence in the future.\n\n404\n00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.625\n&gt;&gt; Don, it seems like step six and\nseven kinda run hand in hand.\n\n405\n00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:47.531\nAs you've said in the previous steps here,\nthat, hey, we might have to test again,\n\n406\n00:18:47.531 --> 00:18:49.920\nand then come back and\nimplement, test again.\n\n407\n00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.680\nHow about performing\na root cause analysis?\n\n408\n00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.550\nIt does say implement\npreventative measures.\n\n409\n00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:59.540\nWhat happens if you don't know what those\npreventive measures are until you perform\n\n410\n00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.000\na root cause analysis?\n\n411\n00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:01.820\nWell, you don't, right.\n\n412\n00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.250\nSo if I don't know what the cause was,\n\n413\n00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.341\nhow can I implement any kind\nof preventative measure?\n\n414\n00:19:05.341 --> 00:19:08.500\nI've got to know what the cause is,\notherwise, I'm just guessing in the dark,\n\n415\n00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.420\nwhich sadly is what a lot of\nsecurity professionals do.\n\n416\n00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.879\nIf we really identify the problem,\nif we really know what it is,\n\n417\n00:19:15.879 --> 00:19:19.229\nthen you can formulate a true,\npreventative maintenance, right.\n\n418\n00:19:19.229 --> 00:19:22.040\nSo let me give you an example\nof the wrong way to do it.\n\n419\n00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.340\nI'm got a service that's crashing.\n\n420\n00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:28.230\nSo once a day this service crashes and\nit stops working.\n\n421\n00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.150\nSo what do I do?\n\n422\n00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.280\nWell, on a Linux system,\nI could write a cron job that looks for\n\n423\n00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.400\nwhen the service stops and\njust start it again.\n\n424\n00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.780\nOr in Windows, I can use the service\nrecovery feature and say, hey,\n\n425\n00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.170\nif it crashes,\njust restart it five seconds later.\n\n426\n00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:41.330\nAnd it restarts.\n\n427\n00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:46.190\nOkay, well, I found my problem,\nmy problem was the service crashing.\n\n428\n00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:50.430\nAnd I put a fix in to just\nstart it back up again, right.\n\n429\n00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:53.170\nBut I'm just fixing the symptom there, and\n\n430\n00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.290\nthe cause is still present\nin the background.\n\n431\n00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:56.700\nI haven't found the cause.\n\n432\n00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.770\nAnd so all I'm really doing\nis what's called a kludge.\n\n433\n00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:02.800\nI'm just putting a little hack-type\nfix in there that's not a real fix.\n\n434\n00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.200\nI'm still having down time.\n\n435\n00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.260\nIt might be a micro outage, but\nit's still happening, right.\n\n436\n00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.050\nI've gotta figure out what that cause is,\n\n437\n00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:13.040\notherwise I'm just throwing darts in\nthe dark, trying to hit a target.\n\n438\n00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.680\nIf I can figure out why\nthat service is crashing,\n\n439\n00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.260\nnow I can make it where it just\nstays up in the first place.\n\n440\n00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:23.160\nAnd I don't seem some crazy script running\ncuz what's gonna happen is eventually\n\n441\n00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.000\nthat script is gonna stop running.\n\n442\n00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.130\nOr it will be tied to a user account, and\n\n443\n00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.590\nthe user account's password will\nexpire and now the script won't run.\n\n444\n00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.112\nNow the service starts locking up again,\nand\n\n445\n00:20:31.112 --> 00:20:33.364\nyou're gonna have to deal with\nthe ticket all over again, right.\n\n446\n00:20:33.364 --> 00:20:34.168\nThat's called rework,\n\n447\n00:20:34.168 --> 00:20:36.580\nwhen you have to deal with\nthe service ticket more than once.\n\n448\n00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.450\nYou don't want that.\n\n449\n00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:40.620\nYou want to make sure you solve\nit correctly in the first place.\n\n450\n00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.519\nNow, assuming that you\nfind the root cause, and\n\n451\n00:20:43.519 --> 00:20:48.338\nyou come up with a resolution and you get\nit corrected, then we're in business.\n\n452\n00:20:48.338 --> 00:20:51.790\nNow, the world is safe once more,\nand we make it to step eight,\n\n453\n00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.625\nwhich is the most important one.\n\n454\n00:20:53.625 --> 00:20:55.620\nDocument our findings.\n\n455\n00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.780\nHow do we troubleshoot the problem?\n\n456\n00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.740\nHow do we implement a solution?\n\n457\n00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.620\nWhat worked, what didn't work?\n\n458\n00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:06.520\nAnd at the end of the day, what was\nthe final fix and how do we verify it?\n\n459\n00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.750\nAll of that important.\n\n460\n00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.630\nAnd the main reason it's important is\nthat you may only have this problem\n\n461\n00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:15.820\none time in your entire life, and that's\nit and the documentation doesn't matter.\n\n462\n00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.925\nOr you might see this problem again.\n\n463\n00:21:17.925 --> 00:21:19.500\nAnd I'm really guilty of this.\n\n464\n00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.540\nAgain, just yesterday I was working on\na network camera that we had here in\n\n465\n00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.530\nthe office.\n\n466\n00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:28.010\nAnd I was having a problem with it, and\n\n467\n00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:32.550\nI had the exact same problem,\nprobably, six months ago.\n\n468\n00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:37.217\nAnd I know I fixed it six months ago,\nand I can't remember what I did.\n\n469\n00:21:37.217 --> 00:21:41.230\nI did research, I read the manuals,\nI found the problem, I fixed it.\n\n470\n00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.240\nAnd then I put it out of my mind and\nI didn't write it down.\n\n471\n00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.910\nAnd here I am today, this very moment,\ntrying to remember what I did six months\n\n472\n00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.490\nago, and regretting the fact\nthat I didn't write it down.\n\n473\n00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:54.920\nWell, in a server environment that happens\na lot because in a server environment,\n\n474\n00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:59.080\nyou usually have a large\nquantity of very similar systems.\n\n475\n00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:03.090\nAnd a problem affecting one will\nlikely affect others down the road, so\n\n476\n00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:05.180\nwe want to make sure we document that.\n\n477\n00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.400\nI used to work for a consulting company.\n\n478\n00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.310\nWe had this file,\nit was called nice to know.\n\n479\n00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.840\nAnd I thought it was funny\nwhen I was first hired, but\n\n480\n00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.210\nby the time I left that company,\nI lived in that folder.\n\n481\n00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.520\nAny time a technician solved a problem,\nthey would write it up,\n\n482\n00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.360\nand they would stick in it\nin this nice to know folder.\n\n483\n00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.265\nThis was all digital, not paper.\n\n484\n00:22:21.265 --> 00:22:23.170\nI'm acting like it was paper.\n\n485\n00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:27.140\nAnd if you had a problem you could go and\nsearch through that nice to know folder,\n\n486\n00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.980\nand you'd find all sorts of gems\nin there that people would find.\n\n487\n00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.640\nAnd I mean just really amazing stuff.\n\n488\n00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.360\nThat's the value that we can create.\n\n489\n00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.130\nEveryone's environment is so different\nthat it's not really possible to have one\n\n490\n00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.670\nbig nice to know folder for\nthe entire world.\n\n491\n00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.170\nBut in your company, you can create one.\n\n492\n00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.950\nAnd now you and the other engineers\ncan all share information and\n\n493\n00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:47.200\nmake sure that you're making\nthe right decisions, and\n\n494\n00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.290\nsolving things as quickly and\nefficiently as possible.\n\n495\n00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.620\nAll right, so that eight step\ntroubleshooting method methodology,\n\n496\n00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:54.640\nit's mostly common sense.\n\n497\n00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.110\nI probably didn't tell you guys anything\nthat was earth-shattering or mind-numbing.\n\n498\n00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.870\nIt's pretty straightforward.\n\n499\n00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.190\nBut if you don't have a documented\nmethodology, this is a great one to adopt\n\n500\n00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.940\nbecause it really does cover all\nthe bases of what you need to do.\n\n501\n00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.220\nAnd it is just a suggestion and guideline.\n\n502\n00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.940\nYou can always change this around\nto meet the needs of your company.\n\n503\n00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.110\nBut it's pretty solid\nthe way that it's written, so\n\n504\n00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:15.920\nit's definitely one that I recommend.\n\n505\n00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.750\nNow, how we troubleshoot is\ngonna be a little bit different.\n\n506\n00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:22.150\nAnd as we talk about troubleshooting\nover the next few episodes,\n\n507\n00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.260\nwhat are we really talking about?\n\n508\n00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.700\nWhat we're really talking about\nis establishing a theory, right.\n\n509\n00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:31.540\nWhen we troubleshoot a problem,\nwe're establishing a theory, right.\n\n510\n00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.585\nWhen we fix the problem,\nwe're implementing the solution.\n\n511\n00:23:34.585 --> 00:23:37.560\nSo steps two and five, those are really\nwhat we're gonna focus on in the next\n\n512\n00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.440\nfour or five episodes, as we go through\nthat, on software, and hardware, and\n\n513\n00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.350\nnetworking and all that good stuff,\nstorage and so on.\n\n514\n00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:46.462\nBut the process is much bigger, right.\n\n515\n00:23:46.462 --> 00:23:49.506\nWe need to go through all these various\nsteps to make sure the systems are working\n\n516\n00:23:49.506 --> 00:23:50.726\nthe way that we intend them to.\n\n517\n00:23:50.726 --> 00:23:56.930\nAnd then implement them in a repeatable\nmanner that everybody can benefit from.\n\n518\n00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:58.570\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\na lot of great information.\n\n519\n00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.190\nAnd, boy, I know that you have\nused troubleshooting methods\n\n520\n00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.045\nmany times in life, in your career.\n\n521\n00:24:03.045 --> 00:24:03.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n522\n00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.510\nit does look like I don't know if we're\ngonna be able to troubleshoot the clock\n\n523\n00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:07.141\nrunning out of minutes.\n\n524\n00:24:07.141 --> 00:24:10.210\nSo [LAUGH] before we bring this one to\nan end, do you have any final words?\n\n525\n00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:12.040\n&gt;&gt; That's about it.\n\n526\n00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.950\nI know it's another bureaucracy episode,\nso\n\n527\n00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:15.520\nit doesn't sound as exciting as possible.\n\n528\n00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.380\nIt'll get more exciting when we get into\nthe actual trouble-shooting episodes.\n\n529\n00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.290\nBut just bear in mind, there is\na reason why we have all these steps.\n\n530\n00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:25.010\nAnd I can't encourage you enough,\nonly make one change at a time.\n\n531\n00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:26.810\nMake one change, test it.\n\n532\n00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:27.510\nIf it works, great.\n\n533\n00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:28.860\nIf it doesn't, roll it back.\n\n534\n00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.050\nDon't make multiple changes.\n\n535\n00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:33.060\nIt's just gonna lead to trouble.\n\n536\n00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.740\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwords of wisdom from Don Pezet.\n\n537\n00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.780\nThank you for\nbeing here in the studios with us.\n\n538\n00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.260\nAnd thank you to you, the viewer watching.\n\n539\n00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.440\nKeep in mind,\nwe got a lot more troubleshooting to come.\n\n540\n00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.423\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n541\n00:24:43.423 --> 00:24:44.221\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n542\n00:24:44.221 --> 00:24:45.319\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n543\n00:24:45.319 --> 00:24:52.193\n[MUSIC]\n\n544\n00:24:52.193 -->

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.839\nHello and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.217\nI am your host Wes Bryan and in today's\nepisode we are continuing through\n\n5\n00:00:19.217 --> 00:00:22.103\nour CompTIA Server+ SK0-004 training.\n\n6\n00:00:22.103 --> 00:00:25.015\nAnd joining us back in the studios\nis none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:26.005\nDon how are you doing sir?\n\n8\n00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:26.683\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:26.683 --> 00:00:30.172\nWes ready to dive right back into server\nplus and we've kicked off troubleshooting.\n\n10\n00:00:30.172 --> 00:00:31.850\nWe've talked about some fundamentals and\ntheories.\n\n11\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.310\nIn this episode, we're going to talk\nabout troubleshooting hardware.\n\n12\n00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.570\nFortunately, troubleshooting hardware\nwith a server is usually pretty easy,\n\n13\n00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.050\nbecause the vendors don't want\nyou to mess with the hardware.\n\n14\n00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.300\nWhen you have it under warranty and\n\n15\n00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.400\nsomething goes wrong,\nthey want to come and fix it.\n\n16\n00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.750\nIt's under warranty,\nthat's the whole point.\n\n17\n00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.401\nBut if it's not under warranty, or\n\n18\n00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:51.382\nif you're just trying to get\na general diagnosis of the server.\n\n19\n00:00:51.382 --> 00:00:54.273\nWe do need to understand some basic\nprinciples of hardware troubleshooting,\n\n20\n00:00:54.273 --> 00:00:55.640\nhow we can identify it.\n\n21\n00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.860\nNow, I also mentioned like vendors and\nwarranty and\n\n22\n00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.060\nall that, it could be that in your\nenvironment you custom build your servers.\n\n23\n00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.700\nAnd I know what you're thinking is who's\ncustom building servers these days?\n\n24\n00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.970\nIf I get a workstation, if I'm in\nan enterprise business I don't build my\n\n25\n00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.590\nown workstation, I just get them\nfrom Dell or HP or whoever.\n\n26\n00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.625\nWell, with servers you can do that too.\n\n27\n00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:19.205\nBut there are really large\norganizations like Google\n\n28\n00:01:19.205 --> 00:01:21.845\nwhere they do custom-build\nall of their own servers.\n\n29\n00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:23.645\nAnd because they're custom-built,\nif something goes wrong,\n\n30\n00:01:23.645 --> 00:01:25.225\nyou think they do a warranty call?\n\n31\n00:01:25.225 --> 00:01:26.145\nNo, they can't.\n\n32\n00:01:26.145 --> 00:01:29.625\nThey built the servers themselves, so\ntheir engineers have to be able to do\n\n33\n00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:34.150\ntroubleshooting and diagnose the systems\nand repair them and get them back online.\n\n34\n00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.260\nIt's not that common anymore for\nmost enterprises.\n\n35\n00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.670\nBut when you reach a massive size\nlike that, it becomes common again.\n\n36\n00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.720\nIt's almost like going full circle from\ncheap to expensive to cheap again but\n\n37\n00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.925\non a scale what makes\nit insanely expensive.\n\n38\n00:01:47.925 --> 00:01:48.955\nSo anyhow, enough of that.\n\n39\n00:01:48.955 --> 00:01:50.815\nLet's actually talk about\nthe troubleshooting.\n\n40\n00:01:50.815 --> 00:01:52.921\nNow we're going to divide this\nshow up into a couple of pieces,\n\n41\n00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:53.925\nlike the exam objectives do.\n\n42\n00:01:53.925 --> 00:01:57.098\nWe're gonna start talking about just some\nof the common problems that would lead us\n\n43\n00:01:57.098 --> 00:01:58.895\nto need to do hardware troubleshooting.\n\n44\n00:01:58.895 --> 00:02:02.085\nAnd what are some of the common\ncauses of those problems?\n\n45\n00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:05.041\nWhat is it that leads to\nthese type of issues?\n\n46\n00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:08.203\nAnd then we're gonna talk about some of\nthe tools of the trade that we use to\n\n47\n00:02:08.203 --> 00:02:09.670\nwork with these problems.\n\n48\n00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.730\nAnd lastly, some of the environmental\nissues that we kind of\n\n49\n00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.510\nalready talked about in other episodes.\n\n50\n00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.860\nSo we'll kind of move through\nthat a little bit more quickly.\n\n51\n00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.930\nSo let's start with some of the common\nproblems that we have as far as\n\n52\n00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.890\nhardware is concerned.\n\n53\n00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.418\nOne of the main things is that when\nyou push the power button on a server,\n\n54\n00:02:26.418 --> 00:02:29.228\nit's going to run a power-on self-test.\n\n55\n00:02:29.228 --> 00:02:30.015\nOr a POST, and\n\n56\n00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:34.850\nthat POST test is it checking out all\nof its hardware to make sure it's okay.\n\n57\n00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.370\nI say all.\nIt's most of the hardware.\n\n58\n00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.730\nThere is some hardware that goes\nunchecked at the very early stages,\n\n59\n00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.490\nlike hard drives usually, but most of\nthe hardware is getting checked, your CPU,\n\n60\n00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.060\nyour RAM, and so on.\n\n61\n00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.630\nAnd they're getting examined and\nmaking sure that they function properly.\n\n62\n00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.860\nAnd if something goes wrong,\nyou will fail the post, right?\n\n63\n00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.330\nSo you'll get a post error on your screen.\n\n64\n00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.660\nNow, post errors can take\na few different forms,\n\n65\n00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.450\nwhich I talked about\nin an earlier episode.\n\n66\n00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.530\nIf the video card has passed it's test,\n\n67\n00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.450\nthen you're going to see\nvideo output on your screen.\n\n68\n00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.413\nBut if the video card hasn't\npassed it's test yet.\n\n69\n00:03:07.413 --> 00:03:10.196\nThen you're not gonna see\nanything on the screen, and\n\n70\n00:03:10.196 --> 00:03:14.191\nyou could potentially get a post error\nprior to the video card initializing and\n\n71\n00:03:14.191 --> 00:03:16.693\nwhen that happens,\nit's got no way to tell you.\n\n72\n00:03:16.693 --> 00:03:18.100\nSo how do you figure that out?\n\n73\n00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.080\nHow do you determine what the problem is?\n\n74\n00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.120\nWell we have to think about the order\nthis hardware is checked in a post.\n\n75\n00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.580\nWhen you apply power,\n\n76\n00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.440\nthe power supply is technically already\nsupplying power to the motherboard.\n\n77\n00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.526\nAnd when you push power,\n\n78\n00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:33.903\nyou're contacting two pins on the\nmotherboard that is telling it to wake up.\n\n79\n00:03:33.903 --> 00:03:38.400\nAnd what you're really waking up\nis the BIOS, or the UEFI system.\n\n80\n00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.590\nAnd that's going to start to wake up and\ninitialize my other hardware.\n\n81\n00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.160\nIt's going to wake up the CPU first.\n\n82\n00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.510\nGot to get the CPU working.\n\n83\n00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.050\nIt's going to wake up the RAM, so\nthe CPU has a place to store things.\n\n84\n00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.250\nAnd then after that it's gonna start\nmoving through the other systems.\n\n85\n00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.120\nLike the video card and network rate\ncontrollers and all the other good stuff.\n\n86\n00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.370\nBut if the CPU fails,\nor if the memory fails.\n\n87\n00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.110\nWe never make it to the video card and\nall the other good stuff, right?\n\n88\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.170\nBut the BIOS chip,\nit's able to do it's job.\n\n89\n00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.179\nAnd the chips out of the motherboard\nis able to do its job and\n\n90\n00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:07.430\nstart to run the post.\n\n91\n00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.590\nEven if the CPU fails, but\n\n92\n00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.720\nthen it's going to have to give\nyou notifications some other way.\n\n93\n00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.525\nSo we talked about beep\ncodes in another episode and\n\n94\n00:04:15.525 --> 00:04:19.782\nthe LCD screens that can tell us little\ncodes about what might be going wrong.\n\n95\n00:04:19.782 --> 00:04:23.830\nThere's LED diagnostic lights that might\nbe available on the front of them.\n\n96\n00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.476\nBut there are other mechanisms.\n\n97\n00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:29.429\nFor example, there's many companies\nthat sell these little PCI cards that\n\n98\n00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:31.310\nare called POST test cards.\n\n99\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.430\nAnd you can pop them into a PCI\nslot in your motherboard.\n\n100\n00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.238\nAnd as the system boots up,\n\n101\n00:04:36.238 --> 00:04:40.330\nit will start to show you\ninformation about what's going on.\n\n102\n00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.090\nAnd it does it, usually it's like\na hexadecimal code you have to look up\n\n103\n00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.240\nagainst a book to find\nout what's going on.\n\n104\n00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.570\nBut if it freezes at a particular spot,\nit will be displaying a code and\n\n105\n00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.050\nlets you know what the problem is.\n\n106\n00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.926\nWell many servers have this built,\n\n107\n00:04:52.926 --> 00:04:56.301\nincluding the cracked open one\nthat I've got behind me here, so\n\n108\n00:04:56.301 --> 00:05:00.323\nI want to show you guys that process how\ndoes the Post area codes kind of work.\n\n109\n00:05:00.323 --> 00:05:03.840\nAnd when the system is up and running you\ndon't see anything special that server\n\n110\n00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.464\nit's a little blue, bluing glowing circles\non the back on there it's just kind of\n\n111\n00:05:07.464 --> 00:05:10.220\nsitting there, but\nif I were to reboot that server right now.\n\n112\n00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.370\nLet me just get into it and reboot it.\n\n113\n00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.524\nI'm going to reboot a production server\nwithout filing any downtime reports so\n\n114\n00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:19.073\nI'll probably get in trouble for\nthat later on.\n\n115\n00:05:19.073 --> 00:05:21.610\nI'll tell it it's an unplanned\noutage even though it's my fault.\n\n116\n00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.120\nOkay so that thing is going\nto reboot right now, and\n\n117\n00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.060\nas we watch that server you're going\nto see some little red lights light up.\n\n118\n00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.532\nOkay, and what it has is a post code\nchecker right on the motherboard.\n\n119\n00:05:33.532 --> 00:05:38.599\nAnd so I've got a 79 right now, and\nthen a 95, and a 99, what does that mean?\n\n120\n00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:39.880\nI have no idea.\n\n121\n00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.380\nI don't know what a 99 is.\n\n122\n00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.830\nBut because it moved past it, I know\nwhatever it was, it checked out okay, and\n\n123\n00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.100\nit moved beyond it.\n\n124\n00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.455\nIf my system were to freeze, like at d7.\n\n125\n00:05:49.455 --> 00:05:54.420\nIf it were to freeze right there at d7 I\ncan look up that D7 code, and find out.\n\n126\n00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.180\nNow, the light's just turned off, and that\nmeans we've cleared through POST, right?\n\n127\n00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.550\nSo we move through the power on self test\nand all of the hardware checked out okay.\n\n128\n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.520\nIf the video card wasn't initialized,\nI can rely on numbers like that coming up\n\n129\n00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.700\nto tell me where the problem is,\nand that helps me find that issue.\n\n130\n00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.668\nIf the video card has initialized, though,\nI don't even need that cuz I can just\n\n131\n00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:20.630\nuse the regular bio-screens like\non my HP e-server behind me.\n\n132\n00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.460\nWhen you power that thing on you'll see a\nscreen that looks something like this and\n\n133\n00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.150\nif I look it's telling me there's\n38 gigs of memory installed.\n\n134\n00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.868\nSo, it actually did a check to see\nhow much memory was in the system and\n\n135\n00:06:32.868 --> 00:06:36.867\nthen it has Proliant system bios and\nhere's the bios that it's running.\n\n136\n00:06:36.867 --> 00:06:39.540\nAnd it detected one\nprocessor with four cores.\n\n137\n00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.300\nIt's a Xeon.\n\n138\n00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.820\nIt's detecting the hardware and\nkind of outputting it here.\n\n139\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.530\nIf an error happened like\nwith the power regulator or\n\n140\n00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.020\nwhatever, it might tell me that\nright here on this screen.\n\n141\n00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.980\nNow it's only displaying\nlimited information to me here.\n\n142\n00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.650\nAt the bottom it's telling me press\nany key to view option ROM messages.\n\n143\n00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.940\nWhat are option ROMS?\n\n144\n00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.000\nWell you might actually have more\nthan one BIOS in your system.\n\n145\n00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.050\nThis one does.\n\n146\n00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.310\nWhen I power it on, there's the BIOS\nthat's part of the chipset that's\n\n147\n00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.670\npowering on the motherboard.\n\n148\n00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.480\nThen there's the BIOS for\nthe RAID controller, and another one for\n\n149\n00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.170\nthe network adapters, and another one for\nthe ilo, the inside lights out board.\n\n150\n00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.410\nFor remote management.\n\n151\n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.601\nAnd all of those do their own checks too.\n\n152\n00:07:19.601 --> 00:07:20.945\nThey're just being hidden from me.\n\n153\n00:07:20.945 --> 00:07:24.073\nIf they get an error, it'll pop up where I\ncan press in a key and I'll view them and\n\n154\n00:07:24.073 --> 00:07:25.050\nsee them, right?\n\n155\n00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.150\nI'm using a screen shot here, cuz if I\ntry and do this live it's a nightmare for\n\n156\n00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.520\nme to hit the buttons in time.\n\n157\n00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.390\nBut basically, it's showing me\nwhat's going on on the system.\n\n158\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.790\nAnd I can find out usually what\nmy hardware issue is right there.\n\n159\n00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.460\n&gt;&gt; Don, you've stressed throughout this\nseries that servers are just ultra\n\n160\n00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.220\nproprietary.\n\n161\n00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.340\nSo is it safe to say that\nthe BIOS screens that we see.\n\n162\n00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.710\nWe're looking at one\nthat's from HP right now.\n\n163\n00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.708\nWill differ from manufacturers\nsince there's not a consistency in\n\n164\n00:07:49.708 --> 00:07:51.108\nthe BIOS' themselves.\n\n165\n00:07:51.108 --> 00:07:52.420\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah.\n\n166\n00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.916\nThe Dell ones, the Lenovo ones,\nthey look completely different.\n\n167\n00:07:54.916 --> 00:07:58.352\nThey're all internally developed and\nthey're proprietary.\n\n168\n00:07:58.352 --> 00:07:59.788\nThey're unique to that system.\n\n169\n00:07:59.788 --> 00:08:01.787\nSo they definitely vary and change.\n\n170\n00:08:01.787 --> 00:08:03.788\nBut most of them are pretty\nself explanatory.\n\n171\n00:08:03.788 --> 00:08:05.165\nI mean when you look at\nthe front of this one.\n\n172\n00:08:05.165 --> 00:08:08.700\nIf we look at the information, like here,\nthe inlet ambient temperature.\n\n173\n00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.930\nSo that means air coming into the server.\n\n174\n00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.040\nRight now it's 21 degrees celsius or\n69 degrees fahrenheit.\n\n175\n00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.570\nWell that means if I were\nto go into my server room,\n\n176\n00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:17.960\nit's probably 69 degrees\nin the server room.\n\n177\n00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.600\nThat's the air that it's bringing in.\n\n178\n00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.170\nIf that number is high, that may indicate\na problem with my air conditioning or\n\n179\n00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.210\nproblem with a server itself\ngenerating too much heat, right and\n\n180\n00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.520\na thermal shut down or over heating.\n\n181\n00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.110\nThat's a problem that we can have.\n\n182\n00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.830\nIt's usually caused by fan failures.\n\n183\n00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.430\nWell, during the power on self test,\n\n184\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.580\nwe would normally run through\nthe fan checks and verify that.\n\n185\n00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.450\nOn this screen down here\nat the bottom right,\n\n186\n00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.540\nthere's this little bubble where\nit says sea of sensors, right?\n\n187\n00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.540\nThat's HP's sensors that are built\nall around the motherboard,\n\n188\n00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.410\nwhere it can check temperatures and\nfan speeds and all those things.\n\n189\n00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.750\nSo, if there's a fan that's failing,\nit's gonna let me know, and\n\n190\n00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.500\nit's gonna report that so that I can take\naction or whatever it is that I need.\n\n191\n00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.870\nYou'll see where it's\nchecking those things, too.\n\n192\n00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:57.710\nThe power regulator,\n\n193\n00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.280\ndynamic power capping, all these\ndifferent features that it's turning on.\n\n194\n00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.847\nIt's running checks about those.\n\n195\n00:09:03.847 --> 00:09:06.130\nNow, let's say that I had an error here,\nright?\n\n196\n00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.090\nThat it comes up and I get a memory error.\n\n197\n00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.520\nMaybe it's a simple error like I know\nthere's 38 gigs in that server but\n\n198\n00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.430\nit only says 16 gigs are detected.\n\n199\n00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:17.540\nWell that's not really an error,\nit's just missing memory.\n\n200\n00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.770\nWhat's going on there?\n\n201\n00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.330\nOr I might actually get a memory error.\n\n202\n00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:21.170\nDown here you can see I've\n\n203\n00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.215\ngot my Advanced Memory Protection\nMode: Advanced ECC Support.\n\n204\n00:09:24.215 --> 00:09:26.700\nMaybe I get some kind of\nerror telling me that ECC\n\n205\n00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.560\nis not working the way that\nit's supposed to, right?\n\n206\n00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.720\nWell, what can happen here\nis several different things.\n\n207\n00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.060\nThe causes of a memory failure,\nthe most common one is chip creak.\n\n208\n00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.810\nThat the chips can come\nloose in their sockets.\n\n209\n00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.730\nServers vibrate, data sensors vibrate,\nit happens, they can come loose.\n\n210\n00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.970\nThey normally have little locking arms\non them, but they're only so effective.\n\n211\n00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.030\nOften times, taking the memory out and\nputting the memory back in.\n\n212\n00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.950\nReceiving the memory\ncan solve that problem.\n\n213\n00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.490\nAnd it's very easy to test.\n\n214\n00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.460\nYou don't even need extra hardware.\n\n215\n00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.990\nYou just pop it out and\npop it back in, right.\n\n216\n00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.010\nTypically, if you actually\nhave a failed memory stick,\n\n217\n00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.740\nit'll tell you the exact\nslot that has failed.\n\n218\n00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.990\nIt'll say slot 3 fails memory test.\n\n219\n00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.910\nAnd so now you know to go and find slot 3.\n\n220\n00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.900\nAnd either replace that memory or\nre-seat it.\n\n221\n00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.190\nRun through a few tests to verify.\n\n222\n00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.930\nOther things could be incompatible memory,\nright?\n\n223\n00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:17.030\nWhen I buy a server from HPE,\nthey expect me to buy the memory from HPE.\n\n224\n00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.070\nYou don't have to.\n\n225\n00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.030\nI can go anywhere and buy memory.\n\n226\n00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.460\nBut when you go somewhere else and\nbuy memory,\n\n227\n00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.190\nyou might get memory that's\nnot completely compatible.\n\n228\n00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.740\nMaybe it's not ECC.\n\n229\n00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.743\nOr maybe I have some DDR3 and\nthen I buy some extra DDR2.\n\n230\n00:10:28.743 --> 00:10:29.487\nWell they're not the same.\n\n231\n00:10:29.487 --> 00:10:31.058\nThey're not the same speed and\n\n232\n00:10:31.058 --> 00:10:34.300\nit's gonna slow down my DDR3\nto match the DDR2 speeds.\n\n233\n00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.570\nThat's gonna give me poor performance.\n\n234\n00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.495\nNot an error but a mess up.\n\n235\n00:10:38.495 --> 00:10:40.065\nOr we can get incompatible memory.\n\n236\n00:10:40.065 --> 00:10:41.855\nWhere you might have some\ndual channel memory and\n\n237\n00:10:41.855 --> 00:10:45.005\nsome single channel memory and\nnow they just don't work together.\n\n238\n00:10:45.005 --> 00:10:46.323\nI put it in dual channel mode and\n\n239\n00:10:46.323 --> 00:10:49.065\nthe single channel stuff\ndoesn't get detected, right?\n\n240\n00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.475\nAnd we end up seeing less\nmemory than we anticipated.\n\n241\n00:10:51.475 --> 00:10:54.315\nThose are typical memory issues\nthat we have on a system.\n\n242\n00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.870\nAfter that it's just\nonboard component failure,\n\n243\n00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:02.430\nindividual things like the chipset\nitself can have a failure,\n\n244\n00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.340\nthe RAID controller could have a failure,\nall these different devices could fail.\n\n245\n00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.930\nAnd you're typically gonna get\nonscreen output about those,\n\n246\n00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.680\nas long as it's not the video adapter.\n\n247\n00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.350\nIf it's the video adapter, that's when\nyou're gonna expect beep codes or\n\n248\n00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.650\nan LCD message, something that's\ngonna come up, not on the monitor,\n\n249\n00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.650\nbecause the video card is not working.\n\n250\n00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.680\nNow, there is one scenario,\nthough, where video card and\n\n251\n00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.560\nmemory start to get tied together.\n\n252\n00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.680\nAnd that is, there are some\nservers that use shared memory for\n\n253\n00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.970\nthe video card with the regular system.\n\n254\n00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.840\nSo it's actually using your traditional\nRAM as memory for the video card.\n\n255\n00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.280\nNow that's not a very common\nthing in a normal server.\n\n256\n00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.573\nIn a normal server, it's gonna have\na pretty crummy video card in it because\n\n257\n00:11:42.573 --> 00:11:44.691\nthey know you're not\nhooking a monitor up to it.\n\n258\n00:11:44.691 --> 00:11:50.240\nSo it will be a simple Intel video\ncard that only has maybe 64 MB of RAM.\n\n259\n00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.060\n64 MB not gigs, right?\n\n260\n00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:56.520\nA really small amount of memory cuz that's\nall you need for a server's video card.\n\n261\n00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:02.130\nIt's not gonna be like a GeForce 1060 with\n2 gigs of DDR4 or anything like that.\n\n262\n00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.800\nIt's gonna be something really,\nreally low end.\n\n263\n00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.370\nAnd so, we don't have shared memory.\n\n264\n00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.772\nBut we are seeing servers these days\nwhere they offer a higher GPU options.\n\n265\n00:12:09.772 --> 00:12:11.910\nAnd they may leverage shared memory.\n\n266\n00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.670\nSo, you've gotta make sure\nyou pay attention to that.\n\n267\n00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.030\nA memory failure could show\nitself as a video failure.\n\n268\n00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:20.390\nIf you ever do that like take a server and\njust pop all the memory out and\n\n269\n00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:21.540\nhit the power button.\n\n270\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.890\nWhen you do that you'll never get video\n\n271\n00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.550\nbecause it doesn't get\nto initialize the video.\n\n272\n00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:28.410\nIt couldn't initialize the memory, so\nit can't initialize the video, right?\n\n273\n00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.360\nThey're tied together in a way.\n\n274\n00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.010\nThat happens and that's where sometimes\nwe can be troubleshooting a symptom.\n\n275\n00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:35.390\nAnd not notice the cause.\n\n276\n00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.240\nHey, I'm not getting video.\n\n277\n00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.780\nLet me replace the video card.\n\n278\n00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.750\nLet me change this cable.\n\n279\n00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:39.690\nLet me check that.\n\n280\n00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.820\nAnd it turns out to be memory, right,\nsomething completely different.\n\n281\n00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.881\nThat's the challenge of\ntroubleshooting hardware.\n\n282\n00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:47.600\nAll right, what else do we have?\n\n283\n00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.639\nProcessor failure,\n\n284\n00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:53.030\nCompTIA specifically calls out processor\nfailure in the exam objectives.\n\n285\n00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:57.110\nIn real life land, processor\nfailures are really, really rare.\n\n286\n00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.680\nAnd there's really only a few\nscenarios where they happen.\n\n287\n00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.240\nYou might have a processor\nfailure on day one.\n\n288\n00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.170\nRight from the factory you\npower on the system and\n\n289\n00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.850\nit doesn't, it just doesn't boot.\n\n290\n00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.980\nRight, because the CPU\nis kind of important.\n\n291\n00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.350\nSo that could be one example.\n\n292\n00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.680\nAnother scenario would be if\nyou're trying to upgrade.\n\n293\n00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.020\nMaybe I bought a two or\nfour socket system and\n\n294\n00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.480\nI didn't fully populate it when I bought\nit, so now I'm adding more processors.\n\n295\n00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:25.310\nIt is very difficult to get multiple\nprocessors to be directly compatible,\n\n296\n00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.710\nthat a lot of times they\nhave slight variations,\n\n297\n00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.660\neven in the same model,\nwhere they don't play nicely together.\n\n298\n00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.140\nAnd so\nyou can run into processor failures there.\n\n299\n00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:38.020\nBut the most common cause of\na processor failure, is overheating.\n\n300\n00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.400\nProcessors get hot, they need\na fan stuck right on top of them.\n\n301\n00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.290\nThey need airflow moving through\nthe server, nice and clear.\n\n302\n00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.980\nAnd if they get too hot,\nit's what's called baking.\n\n303\n00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.880\nThe processor bakes and it damages itself.\n\n304\n00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.022\nCPUs have millions of micro\ntransistors inside of them.\n\n305\n00:13:54.022 --> 00:13:57.480\nThey're very, very small,\nit takes a microscope to see them.\n\n306\n00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.410\nSo an excess of temperature can\ndamage those very, very easily.\n\n307\n00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:05.000\nAnd they get very hot on their own\neven just through normal usage.\n\n308\n00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.500\nAnd that's normally where\nwe see a failure on a CPU.\n\n309\n00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.825\nYou can also have a chip creep on a CPU,\nbecause it swells,\n\n310\n00:14:11.825 --> 00:14:13.335\nit's expands and contracts.\n\n311\n00:14:13.335 --> 00:14:14.705\nBut the design on those things is so\n\n312\n00:14:14.705 --> 00:14:18.935\ntight that normally it's not an issue that\nthey are able to withstand that properly.\n\n313\n00:14:18.935 --> 00:14:22.145\nThe silicon wafers are designed\nnot to expand under heat.\n\n314\n00:14:22.145 --> 00:14:24.485\nAnd so that's not normally an issue.\n\n315\n00:14:24.485 --> 00:14:28.205\nTypically if it's over heating,\nyou're gonna see other symptoms too.\n\n316\n00:14:28.205 --> 00:14:30.170\nWell, like a really, really hot server.\n\n317\n00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:31.930\nIf you can't touch your server,\nthere's a problem.\n\n318\n00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:36.340\nSo that's an easy one to diagnose.\n\n319\n00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:40.900\nIncorrect boot sequence, this one's\nkinda a fun one because when we boot up\n\n320\n00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.700\na system, you push the power button.\n\n321\n00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.030\nIt hits the BIOS or UEFI and\nthen it goes to Boot.\n\n322\n00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.240\nAnd it's gonna look for Boot devices.\n\n323\n00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.690\nAnd depending on your vendor,\nit may be set up different ways.\n\n324\n00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:54.650\nNormally, it looks for removable\nmedia first like CDs and USB keys.\n\n325\n00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.961\nAnd then it moves on to storage,\nall right?\n\n326\n00:14:56.961 --> 00:14:58.620\nAnd that's pretty well expected.\n\n327\n00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.290\nHey, if I'm gonna install an OS, I put\nin removable media to boot off of it.\n\n328\n00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.810\nAnd then I install to the hard drives.\n\n329\n00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:07.915\nWhere it gets a little messy,\nis if you have a RAID controller.\n\n330\n00:15:07.915 --> 00:15:13.225\nBecause now you have onboard storage and\nyou have storage on the RAID controller.\n\n331\n00:15:13.225 --> 00:15:16.175\nAnd if you have a SAN,\nthat brings in a whole new level.\n\n332\n00:15:16.175 --> 00:15:18.585\nSo now, you don't just have hard drives,\n\n333\n00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:20.460\nyou have three different\ntypes of hard drives.\n\n334\n00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.025\nAnd the boot order is\nkind of important there.\n\n335\n00:15:23.025 --> 00:15:26.015\nAnd if you go way back to the beginning\nof the series when I covered installing\n\n336\n00:15:26.015 --> 00:15:28.595\nthe server, I showed how to make\nsure we checked that boot order and\n\n337\n00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:30.310\nthat it's in the right order.\n\n338\n00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.671\nIf you have an onboard RAID controller but\nit's set to boot from local disks then\n\n339\n00:15:33.671 --> 00:15:37.860\nit's not gonna look to the RAID controller\nand it's gonna boot from the wrong place,\n\n340\n00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.510\nand it may not even recognize the RAID\ncontroller storage at that point and\n\n341\n00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:41.940\nyou can have some real problems.\n\n342\n00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.130\nSo we always need to double check\nthose settings inside of our BIOS.\n\n343\n00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.280\n&gt;&gt; Don speaking of the onboard RAID\ncontroller, would that be something that\n\n344\n00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.950\nwould show up in the BIOS if it's\nsomething that's integrated into\n\n345\n00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.060\nsay the motherboard itself and\nit goes through its series of tests.\n\n346\n00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.910\nMaybe we are using an onboard RAID\ncontroller cuz we can't afford one of\n\n347\n00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:57.780\nthe more expensive ones.\n\n348\n00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:01.330\nIs that something that we would see\nmanifest itself in the BIOS of the UEFI?\n\n349\n00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if it's onboard, or\neven if it's an add in card.\n\n350\n00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.170\nIf it's an add in card it will\nstill show up in the BIOS.\n\n351\n00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.590\nBecause an add in card's gonna go\ninto a PCI slot, or a PCIE slot.\n\n352\n00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.590\nAnd the motherboard is managing that and\nthe bios is manages the motherboard.\n\n353\n00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:14.350\nSo that's all gonna be\nright there in the bios.\n\n354\n00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.300\nYou'll see it.\n\n355\n00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.360\nNow the integrated one is\nguaranteed to show up.\n\n356\n00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.550\nYou know you're gonna see it and\nyou can even disable it.\n\n357\n00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.810\nIt might be disabled.\n\n358\n00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.340\nBut the add-in one,\nyou can't disable those.\n\n359\n00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.100\nYou put them in and they're on.\n\n360\n00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.530\nIf you wanna disable it,\nyou take it out, right?\n\n361\n00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:28.650\nBut the boot order is\nstill gonna influence it.\n\n362\n00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.210\nAnd it'll show up in the boot order.\n\n363\n00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.230\nAgain, go back and\nwatch the installing server episode.\n\n364\n00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:36.250\nWe showed how to set that up and\nyou get a chance to see it there.\n\n365\n00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.355\nThose rate controllers,\nthey're expansion cards.\n\n366\n00:16:38.355 --> 00:16:41.360\nAnd rate controllers aren't the only\nexpansion cards that you've got.\n\n367\n00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.022\nYou might have other things that you've\nadded in, like advanced video cards or\n\n368\n00:16:45.022 --> 00:16:47.701\nSSL offload cards,\nthey do encryption and decryption and\n\n369\n00:16:47.701 --> 00:16:51.145\nthen there's all sorts of different\nboards you can add into a server to make\n\n370\n00:16:51.145 --> 00:16:52.970\nit do whatever it is that you need to do.\n\n371\n00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:53.979\nWell, those boards can fail.\n\n372\n00:16:53.979 --> 00:16:55.918\nWe've got the standard chip.\n\n373\n00:16:55.918 --> 00:17:00.320\nIt's really some big chip, if you think\nabout it, when you add an extension card.\n\n374\n00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.057\nBut normally failure there doesn't\nmanifest itself during the post.\n\n375\n00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:09.243\nIf I have a encryption card added to my\nserver, and I blew it up, it doesn't check\n\n376\n00:17:09.243 --> 00:17:13.493\nthat card, it boots on it, because it's\nnot involved in the boot process right,\n\n377\n00:17:13.493 --> 00:17:16.944\nit just boosts the system up,\nPCIe automatically assigns IRQs and\n\n378\n00:17:16.944 --> 00:17:20.054\nall those other things, and\nwe go to the operating system.\n\n379\n00:17:20.054 --> 00:17:24.950\nAnd it's not until the OS goes to use\nthat card, that it'll detect the failure.\n\n380\n00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.720\nAdding cards are much\nharder to troubleshoot,\n\n381\n00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.590\nbecause usually the only way\nwe can troubleshoot them,\n\n382\n00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.420\nis if we have a second one, you can swap\nthem out and see if the second one works.\n\n383\n00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.330\nWhat if you don't have a second one?\n\n384\n00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.600\nNow it's really hard to troubleshoot.\n\n385\n00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.410\nIf it's stopping the system from booting,\nyou can take it out, and\n\n386\n00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.315\nactually one of the recommendations\nyou'll see from Dell and\n\n387\n00:17:41.315 --> 00:17:43.310\nHPE, is if you're having\ntrouble with your server and\n\n388\n00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:47.410\nit won't boot, step one remove\nevery third party component.\n\n389\n00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:51.630\nIf you have third party add in cards,\nif you have third party memory,\n\n390\n00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.500\nanything from a different vendor,\ntake it out of the server.\n\n391\n00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.040\nCan it boot with just the HPE equipment?\n\n392\n00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.179\nOr can it boot with just the Dell or\nLenovo equipment in it?\n\n393\n00:18:01.179 --> 00:18:05.237\nAnd if it can't, now you know you can\ncall in a warranty call because it's just\n\n394\n00:18:05.237 --> 00:18:06.667\nthe Lenovo stuff, right?\n\n395\n00:18:06.667 --> 00:18:11.516\nBut if you got a Lenovo server, with some\ncrucial memory that you added in, cuz\n\n396\n00:18:11.516 --> 00:18:17.140\nyou got a good deal on it, and you've got\nsome 3rd party fans in there and stuff.\n\n397\n00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.610\nNow you don't know,\nbecause when Lenovo built that server,\n\n398\n00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:24.490\nthey tested it, very thoroughly,\nwith their hardware.\n\n399\n00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.330\nThey didn't test it with crucial memory,\n\n400\n00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.140\nthey didn't test it with\ncoarse air fans or whatever.\n\n401\n00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.380\nThey tested it with their hardware.\n\n402\n00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.120\nSo take the third party software out.\n\n403\n00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:33.730\nTest it then.\n\n404\n00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:34.580\nDoes it work?\n\n405\n00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.180\nIf it does, now you know you've\ngot a compatibility issue and\n\n406\n00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.630\nhardware compatibility is a real problem.\n\n407\n00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:43.300\nYou can't have two pieces of hardware\nthat do not play nice together,\n\n408\n00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.210\nit may seem odd.\n\n409\n00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.310\nYou may think, well, these two pieces\nof hardware aren't even related, but\n\n410\n00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.280\nif there's some kind of mistake that was\nmade in the development of that hardware,\n\n411\n00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.990\nyou're the testbed,\nyou're the one figuring that out.\n\n412\n00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.370\nOn servers, we don't normally want\nto be put into that situation.\n\n413\n00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.090\nWhat else do we have?\n\n414\n00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.740\nOperating system not found.\n\n415\n00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.290\nIf you power on your server, and\nyou get operating system not found,\n\n416\n00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.220\nwhat does that mean?\n\n417\n00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.742\nWell, we're gonna do troubleshooting\nsoftware in another episode and\n\n418\n00:19:08.742 --> 00:19:11.170\nit could be a software problem\nwith the operating system.\n\n419\n00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.910\nBut normally, operating system not found,\nthat is so low level.\n\n420\n00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:15.700\nNot that the operating\nsystem wouldn't boot, or\n\n421\n00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:19.870\nthat there was a problem with OS, we\ncouldn't even find the darn thing, right?\n\n422\n00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:23.770\nWell that's normally gonna\nbe tied to boot devices.\n\n423\n00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.700\nWhen your system boots up,\nmost systems are UEFI this days, so\n\n424\n00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:31.310\nyou get your traditional bios that happens\nand then it loads the UEFI subsystem.\n\n425\n00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:35.070\nIt's gonna then look to your hard\ndrives to find an operating system.\n\n426\n00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.940\nThat means it's got to\nfind the hard drives.\n\n427\n00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.820\nIf the hard drives are missing,\nI'm not gonna find an OS, right?\n\n428\n00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.820\nOr if the hard drives are there, but\n\n429\n00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.670\nthey're not configurated properly for\nbooting.\n\n430\n00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.580\nThey don't have a boot record on them.\n\n431\n00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.020\nYou'll get operating system missing,\nit's a common error.\n\n432\n00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:54.185\n&gt;&gt; Don, you've been talking\na lot about storing things like\n\n433\n00:19:54.185 --> 00:19:56.064\ncould this be a physical link or\n\n434\n00:19:56.064 --> 00:19:59.880\nmaybe even a configuration error,\nI know we're in physical right here,\n\n435\n00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.380\ncould this be a physical link\nthat maybe spilled to the sand?\n\n436\n00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.610\n&gt;&gt; Very much, yeah, very much so.\n\n437\n00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.820\nIf you have an HPE, a hose bus adapter.\n\n438\n00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.040\nIt's a PCIE card you're\npopping into your server.\n\n439\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.830\nAnd it's connecting you to\nthe fiber mesh for that SAN.\n\n440\n00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:15.100\nAnd if that fiber link goes down, or\nif the HBA is not recognized, right?\n\n441\n00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:20.100\nMaybe it was doing a BIOS update on that\nHBA and the update was incomplete and\n\n442\n00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.210\nit fails.\n\n443\n00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:23.440\nWell, now when I boot up,\nit's not gonna find hard drives and\n\n444\n00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.730\nit's not gonna find an operating system.\n\n445\n00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:29.510\nAnother scenario would be if I\ninstall Linux, when you install Linux,\n\n446\n00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:31.960\nit always asks you if you\nwanna install the boot loader.\n\n447\n00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.110\nMaybe you say no.\n\n448\n00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.540\nIf you say no, the operating system\ngets loaded but the boot loader doesn't.\n\n449\n00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:40.720\nWhen your system boots up,\nUEFI is looking for the boot loader.\n\n450\n00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.720\nIt doesn't care if the entire\noperating system is there,\n\n451\n00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.840\nif it can't find the boot loader,\noperating system not found.\n\n452\n00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.020\nYour data is there, it's safe.\n\n453\n00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.470\nBut you didn't install the boot loader,\nand\n\n454\n00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.240\nyou can break the boot loader pretty easy.\n\n455\n00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.560\nThey're just files on the hard drive, but\nthey are in a very particular location.\n\n456\n00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.040\nThey have to be the very first\nfiles of that partition.\n\n457\n00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.100\nAnd if they've been moved or damaged,\nyou're not gonna find the OS.\n\n458\n00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.550\nAnd you've gotta go into\nrecovery procedures there.\n\n459\n00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.238\nHaving a backup of your hard drives\nis the best solution for that one.\n\n460\n00:21:06.238 --> 00:21:10.300\nAll right, lets' get to something\na little more common, though.\n\n461\n00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.690\nOn a more common side, on most servers,\nthe hardware failures we're gonna be\n\n462\n00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:17.370\ndealing with are drive failures and\nfan failures.\n\n463\n00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:18.820\nFans fail all the time,\n\n464\n00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.420\nhard drives fail all the time,\nbecause they're moving parts.\n\n465\n00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.260\nThey're the only moving parts in\nyour server, they fail frequently.\n\n466\n00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.710\nAnd that means we're gonna have\nto replace them frequently.\n\n467\n00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.305\nHard drives, we fortunately have\nSMART error testing, right?\n\n468\n00:21:30.305 --> 00:21:31.295\nSMART is an acronym.\n\n469\n00:21:31.295 --> 00:21:32.325\nDo you know what SMART stands for?\n\n470\n00:21:32.325 --> 00:21:33.705\n&gt;&gt; I do not, not off the top of my head.\n\n471\n00:21:33.705 --> 00:21:35.185\n&gt;&gt; It's a big, drawn-out one,\nsee if you can find that one.\n\n472\n00:21:35.185 --> 00:21:35.935\n&gt;&gt; I'll find it for you.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n473\n00:21:35.935 --> 00:21:40.315\nit's a system of checks that a hard drive\ncan do to do early error detection,\n\n474\n00:21:40.315 --> 00:21:44.105\nto see if we've got a sector that's\nfailing or whatever, and repair for it.\n\n475\n00:21:44.105 --> 00:21:47.935\nServers do SMART checks on SCSI,\nSAS, and SATA drives.\n\n476\n00:21:47.935 --> 00:21:49.769\nAnd they check them to see if\nthey can detect any errors.\n\n477\n00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.750\nThen, as we run our operating system,\nthe operating system is also checking for\n\n478\n00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:55.300\nhard drive errors.\n\n479\n00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.070\nSo we normally get good checking that's\ngoing on there to find out whether we've\n\n480\n00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.820\ngot disk failures.\n\n481\n00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.070\nBut they do fail, and when they fail,\nif the system finds it,\n\n482\n00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.980\nusually a little red light will\nlight up on the hard drive.\n\n483\n00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.260\nAnd you know to swap it out.\n\n484\n00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.870\nThe server vendors don't even bat an eye\nat doing a warranty change of hard drives.\n\n485\n00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.780\nThey're used to it, they don't usually\neven ask you to run a diagnostic.\n\n486\n00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.630\nYou got a red light,\nokay we'll send you a new drive.\n\n487\n00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.470\nIt's usually as simple as that.\n\n488\n00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.135\nBut again, if you build your own\nserver you need to verify and\n\n489\n00:22:18.135 --> 00:22:20.857\nmake sure that that disk\nis actually failed.\n\n490\n00:22:20.857 --> 00:22:23.205\n&gt;&gt; Don, yes I believe you\nasked me about an acronym and\n\n491\n00:22:23.205 --> 00:22:24.625\nI didn't know exactly what it was.\n\n492\n00:22:24.625 --> 00:22:27.175\nThat's the self-monitoring and\nanalysis reporting tool.\n\n493\n00:22:27.175 --> 00:22:27.675\n&gt;&gt; Well, there we go.\n\n494\n00:22:27.675 --> 00:22:28.600\nAnd that is exactly what it is.\n\n495\n00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.355\nSelf-monitoring, right?\n\n496\n00:22:29.355 --> 00:22:30.475\nWatching that disk.\n\n497\n00:22:30.475 --> 00:22:33.270\nA lot of times when you boot a server\nyou'll actually see the SMART messages at\n\n498\n00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:36.065\nboot time, sometimes the RAID\ncontroller hides that though.\n\n499\n00:22:36.065 --> 00:22:38.425\nI didn't see that on my server\nbecause I have a RAID controller.\n\n500\n00:22:38.425 --> 00:22:40.610\nThe RAID controller sees the smart status.\n\n501\n00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:41.710\nBut the BIOS doesn't,\n\n502\n00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.250\ncuz the BIOS just sees the RAID controller\nand the RAID controller always passes.\n\n503\n00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:49.310\nSo in order to see the Smart status in my\ncase, I would have to boot all the way in\n\n504\n00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:53.600\nto Windows, and then load\nthe HPE Smart Array Controller Suite,\n\n505\n00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.720\nthere's a software package they have,\nand now I can see all of\n\n506\n00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.880\nthe additional information including\nthe Smart status of those disks.\n\n507\n00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.270\nPower supply failures, here in Florida we\nhave power supply failures all the time,\n\n508\n00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.320\ntypically easy to recognize cuz\nthe power supply doesn't work.\n\n509\n00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.710\nEasy to spot.\n\n510\n00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:11.880\nWell sometimes it can be hard to spot.\n\n511\n00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.160\nSometimes it can be difficult to tell\nwhether or not it's actually working or\n\n512\n00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.930\nnot because all we see is\na light on the back and\n\n513\n00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.435\nif there is no light, well that's usually\nall we have as far is an indicator, but\n\n514\n00:23:19.435 --> 00:23:20.765\nyou unplug it and the light goes out.\n\n515\n00:23:20.765 --> 00:23:23.565\nDoesn't mean the power supply is broken,\nit's just means it's unplug.\n\n516\n00:23:23.565 --> 00:23:25.725\n&gt;&gt; All right done now\nwith the power supplies.\n\n517\n00:23:25.725 --> 00:23:29.905\nI've had to diagnose a standardized\nATX power supply, but\n\n518\n00:23:29.905 --> 00:23:33.480\nwhat I'm learning from being in this\nseries with you is there's nothing really\n\n519\n00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.320\nstandardized about a server.\n\n520\n00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:39.170\nSo how are we gonna test a power\nsupply if there really isn't,\n\n521\n00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:41.300\nI don't know,\nI don't see any wires coming out of it?\n\n522\n00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:41.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n523\n00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.480\nin the exam objectives they specifically\nmention things like power supply testers.\n\n524\n00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.090\nAnd I'll just show you a picture of kind\nof a standard power supply tester here.\n\n525\n00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:53.070\nIf you have an ATX power supply,\nyou can plug it right into this tester.\n\n526\n00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:55.700\nAnd it'll run through and\nshow you how much voltage it's carrying,\n\n527\n00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.880\nwhether it's operational,\nand you can test it.\n\n528\n00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.880\nAnd that works great,\nif you've got standard ATX power supplies.\n\n529\n00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.490\nBut most servers have hot\nswappable power supplies.\n\n530\n00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:09.510\nAnd the ATX power supply spec\ndoes not provide for hot swap.\n\n531\n00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:14.916\nAnd that means we have proprietary power\nsupplies, power supplies that normally\n\n532\n00:24:14.916 --> 00:24:20.290\nhave more of a chip tab type interface\ninstead of a big plug interface like this.\n\n533\n00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:23.360\nSo power supply testers\nare not really valid.\n\n534\n00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.170\nYou can use something like a multimeter,\nor a multimeter.\n\n535\n00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:31.760\nAnd you can take the probes and plug it\nin, but the problem is, most server power\n\n536\n00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.150\nsupplies only power on when they're\nproperly inserted into the server.\n\n537\n00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:38.009\nAnd you can no longer connect these leads,\nright.\n\n538\n00:24:38.009 --> 00:24:39.142\nAnd if you take it out,\n\n539\n00:24:39.142 --> 00:24:42.660\nit no longer applies power and\nyou can't test it anymore.\n\n540\n00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:47.050\nRemember that power supplies are field\nreplaceable units, in their entirety.\n\n541\n00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.350\nThere's no serviceable\nparts on the inside.\n\n542\n00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:52.480\nIf you open it up, you void your warranty,\nand the vendors know that,\n\n543\n00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.760\nand they know the liability, right?\n\n544\n00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.070\nThat if you were to shock yourself\nin there, you could sue them.\n\n545\n00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:57.850\nSo, they put big stickers on there.\n\n546\n00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:58.590\nDon't do maintenance.\n\n547\n00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:02.103\nSo, while we can test power supplies, we\ncan look to see if they're doing 5 volts\n\n548\n00:25:02.103 --> 00:25:04.930\nand 12 volts,\nit's the same as on a desktop.\n\n549\n00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.430\nBecause the connector's proprietary,\n\n550\n00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:09.340\nwe have a real difficulty\nin actually testing it.\n\n551\n00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.270\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, when you do a warranty call on\nsomething like a power supply, you said,\n\n552\n00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.520\nlike for instance, the hard drives.\n\n553\n00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.950\nThey kind of expect it to happen, they\ndon't even really have you running a test.\n\n554\n00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:20.030\nWell, how about with something that, well\nI don't know whether they expect it or\n\n555\n00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:22.780\nnot, but you don't have\nthe ability to run a test on.\n\n556\n00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.470\nLike the power supplies themselves.\n\n557\n00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:29.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in those scenarios typically,\nthere's some kind of diagnostic light\n\n558\n00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.950\non the unit that's letting you\nknow whether it's good or bad.\n\n559\n00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:36.350\nBut if it's completely dead in the water,\nthere is no way to test it, right,\n\n560\n00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:37.340\non a device like that.\n\n561\n00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.720\nBut you call the vendor,\nyou do your warranty call, and you say,\n\n562\n00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.160\nlook I've got this power supply.\n\n563\n00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.200\nWhen I plug it in, no lights come on,\nand it's just not working.\n\n564\n00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.657\nThey might ask you to run a diagnostic.\n\n565\n00:25:47.657 --> 00:25:51.390\nHPE, Lenovo and Dell, all three of\nthem have a special diagnostic disc.\n\n566\n00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:53.700\nIt's a CD, you can burn it,\nor you can burn it to USB.\n\n567\n00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.560\nSome of them actually have it\nbuilt into the motherboard, and\n\n568\n00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.760\nyou can boot the system and\nhit a key sequence to start that up.\n\n569\n00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.380\nAnd it will run through\na full hardware diagnostic.\n\n570\n00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.900\nIt will test the CPU and\nmemory, and so on.\n\n571\n00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:10.330\nAnd as it checks all of those,\nit's running tests that we can't normally.\n\n572\n00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:15.280\nAnd if your system has two power supplies\nand one is dead, it'll spot that, or\n\n573\n00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.630\nit'll just report there's\nonly one power supply.\n\n574\n00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:18.990\nSo, if it can't even see the other one,\nyou know it's dead.\n\n575\n00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:22.014\nBut, if you only have one power supply,\ncan you run diagnostics?\n\n576\n00:26:22.014 --> 00:26:25.348\nNo, if the power supply is dead\nyou can't even turn it on, and\n\n577\n00:26:25.348 --> 00:26:28.120\nat that point the vendors,\nthey're used to that.\n\n578\n00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.230\nIt's not like workstation,\n\n579\n00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:31.010\nwhere they'll drive you nuts\nwith all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n580\n00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.250\nThey'll just dispatch the power supply,\nor whatever.\n\n581\n00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:37.680\nIf you're self building your servers,\nyou need to have spare parts.\n\n582\n00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.220\nYou need to have parts that\nyou can swap out to test.\n\n583\n00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.670\nI think this power supply is dead.\n\n584\n00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.270\nLet me swap in another one and see.\n\n585\n00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:45.600\nAnd, I know what you guys are thinking,\nis that's a waste, like,\n\n586\n00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.780\nhaving extra hardware.\n\n587\n00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:51.410\nWell, if you have 400 servers,\nit's not a big deal to have two or\n\n588\n00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:54.340\nthree extra power supplies laying around\nor two or three extra hard drives.\n\n589\n00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:57.210\nIt's a drop in the bucket compared to\nthe cost of the entire datacenter.\n\n590\n00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:00.060\nSo understand the scale\nthat we're talking about.\n\n591\n00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.555\nIt's not like at home where there's no way\nI'm keeping an extra power supply at home.\n\n592\n00:27:03.555 --> 00:27:06.055\nIn my data center I usually got four or\nfive.\n\n593\n00:27:07.383 --> 00:27:10.221\nAll right, the only other one they\ncall out for common problems is I/O.\n\n594\n00:27:10.221 --> 00:27:13.025\nI/O is input output, we're normally\ntalking about like keyboard and mouse,\n\n595\n00:27:13.025 --> 00:27:16.055\nmonitor, I've already talked\nabout monitor and display.\n\n596\n00:27:16.055 --> 00:27:18.375\nBut usually on a server\nit can be a little weird.\n\n597\n00:27:18.375 --> 00:27:21.855\nMost servers these days have video and\nkeyboard hookups on the front and back\n\n598\n00:27:21.855 --> 00:27:25.000\nbecause they don't know if you're gonna be\nbehind the rack or in front of the rack.\n\n599\n00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.320\nWe don't normally hook up to\nvideo at all on a server,\n\n600\n00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.880\nyou just remotely connect\ninto it to manage it.\n\n601\n00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.030\nBut when you plug your keyboard or\nmouse in, if they're USB,\n\n602\n00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:35.210\nthey just plug right into USB ports.\n\n603\n00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:39.220\nBut some servers won't detect those\nuntil the operating system fires up.\n\n604\n00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.800\nSo if you get into the BIOS they don't\nwork and it's really frustrating.\n\n605\n00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.090\nMost of them will work just fine with USB,\n\n606\n00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:46.020\nit's the PS2 ones you\nhave to watch out for.\n\n607\n00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.790\nThere's still plenty of servers\nthat ship with PS2 ports.\n\n608\n00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.660\nAnd if you've got one of those,\nthe keyboard and\n\n609\n00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.100\nmouse have to be hooked\nup when the server boots.\n\n610\n00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.910\nIf you hook them up after the fact,\nnow they don't work.\n\n611\n00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.200\nAnd now you're not able to interact with\nthe server and you have gotta reboot it.\n\n612\n00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.280\nSo you wanna avoid that if you can.\n\n613\n00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:03.590\nBut, those are just simple\nerrors that can happen.\n\n614\n00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.569\nIn common problems that we\nsee on server hardware.\n\n615\n00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:08.760\nAll right,\nlet's talk about a few other things.\n\n616\n00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.770\nThe causes of these problems,\nI kind of already talked about.\n\n617\n00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:12.950\nThird party components,\n\n618\n00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:16.250\nif web incompatible hardware\nobviously that can cause issues.\n\n619\n00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:19.795\nI've talked about cooling failure,\nmismatched components.\n\n620\n00:28:19.795 --> 00:28:23.340\nBacklane failure we talked about back in\nthe hardware episode but remember that\n\n621\n00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.610\non a server things like hard drives,\nthey're not usually plugged right into\n\n622\n00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:30.160\na motherboard, they're typically run to\na RAID controller or run to a back plane.\n\n623\n00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.210\nAnd the back plane is just a board\nthat has connectors on it.\n\n624\n00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.510\nTechnically your whole\nmotherboard is a back plane.\n\n625\n00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:40.305\nSo for example here I've got\na picture of a simple motherboard and\n\n626\n00:28:40.305 --> 00:28:42.241\nyou've got a bunch of PCI slots.\n\n627\n00:28:42.241 --> 00:28:44.990\nThis was a little old,\nthese are traditional PCI slots.\n\n628\n00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:48.660\nBut if you look really close\non one of these pictures.\n\n629\n00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:52.670\nWhat you're really seeing is just a bunch\nof wires that run from each of these\n\n630\n00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:55.760\nports to connect them all together,\nthat's our back plane and\n\n631\n00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.960\nyou're not normally gonna\nhave a failure there, right?\n\n632\n00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:03.058\nBecause this is typically copper or\nsome other kind of metal run\n\n633\n00:29:03.058 --> 00:29:08.074\ninside of the silicon and\nthat's not gonna fail, but it can.\n\n634\n00:29:08.074 --> 00:29:09.810\nThere's a little\ncapacitors located around.\n\n635\n00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:13.878\nThere is other things in here that\ncould possibly fail, and they are very,\n\n636\n00:29:13.878 --> 00:29:15.750\nvery, very small wires.\n\n637\n00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:19.388\nSo if they expand and contract enough,\nfrom moisture that gets in there,\n\n638\n00:29:19.388 --> 00:29:21.159\nit can cause a short pretty easily.\n\n639\n00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:23.170\nSo, the back plane could be a failure.\n\n640\n00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:26.220\nBack plane failures\nare really hard to diagnose.\n\n641\n00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:29.930\nBecause if I have a hard drive back plane\nand the hard drive back plane is failing,\n\n642\n00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.170\nit will usually manifest itself\nas a hard drive failure.\n\n643\n00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:35.460\nIt will look like hey,\ndrive number three just failed but\n\n644\n00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.790\nit's actually port number three.\n\n645\n00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:40.480\nThat drive number three just\nhappens to be plugged into it.\n\n646\n00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.790\nFortunately you can kinda swap drives\naround and check to see if that is true.\n\n647\n00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:48.610\nIf drive number 3 is failing but\nthen I put it in slot four and it works.\n\n648\n00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.724\nWell then it's the slot that's bad,\nnot the drive.\n\n649\n00:29:51.724 --> 00:29:56.610\nSo be aware that that sometimes an error\ncan manifest itself in odd ways.\n\n650\n00:29:56.610 --> 00:30:00.182\nThe only other one that I haven't\nreally talked about is incompatible or\n\n651\n00:30:00.182 --> 00:30:00.940\nincorrect BIOS.\n\n652\n00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.350\nYour server has a BIOS and\n\n653\n00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.930\nyou'll notice on the screen that I\nshowed you here my server booting up.\n\n654\n00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:09.960\nThat it shows that I've got a ProLiant\nSystem BIOS, a particular number, right?\n\n655\n00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:14.850\nWell, HPE has several ProLiant servers,\nmany different model numbers, and\n\n656\n00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:19.160\nthey all have a unique BIOS just for their\nmodel, so you gotta have the right one.\n\n657\n00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.740\nAnd in the olden days,\nif you flashed a bad BIOS to your system,\n\n658\n00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.160\nyou're in real trouble.\n\n659\n00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.365\nBut most servers now have this,\nredundant ROM.\n\n660\n00:30:28.365 --> 00:30:30.910\nThey'll actually have\ntwo BIOS chips in it.\n\n661\n00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:34.810\nAnd when you update the BIOS,\nyou're writing to one chip and\n\n662\n00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:36.790\nthe other chip maintains the old one.\n\n663\n00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:39.503\nAnd that way, if something goes wrong and\nit won't boot, it just flips back and\n\n664\n00:30:39.503 --> 00:30:40.327\nuses the old one again.\n\n665\n00:30:40.327 --> 00:30:43.760\nSince you're maintaining\ntwo different BIOS chips.\n\n666\n00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:48.495\nIn fact, I think I can see that on my,\ndo I still have my iLO, here we go.\n\n667\n00:30:48.495 --> 00:30:50.917\nIf I go to the system status in iLO board,\n\n668\n00:30:50.917 --> 00:30:55.500\nit actually shows the two different\nBIOS versions that I've got, slowly.\n\n669\n00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.990\nEventually it will come up.\n\n670\n00:30:56.990 --> 00:31:00.530\nAnd my session is probably timed out cuz\nit's been a while since I clicked on this.\n\n671\n00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:01.870\nYep.\n\n672\n00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:04.700\nBut as I get logged in, the reason\nI wanna mention this is that it's\n\n673\n00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.420\na nice feature if you have it,\nnot every server has it.\n\n674\n00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:12.020\nIf you only have one BIOS chip, and\nyou flash the wrong BIOS to it,\n\n675\n00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.230\nyour server is not gonna function\nthe way you anticipate it functioning.\n\n676\n00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:18.080\nAnd now you can effectively\nlock yourself out of it.\n\n677\n00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.400\nThen you'll have to go warranty\ncall on the motherboard.\n\n678\n00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.920\nSo here, if I look, I've got a system ROM,\nand it's showing that W07,\n\n679\n00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.940\nand somewhere in here it\nactually does show me what my\n\n680\n00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:32.570\nbackup is, which I thought it\nwas right here on this screen.\n\n681\n00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:34.560\nActually, it is,\nif I would just read more.\n\n682\n00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:39.391\nI've got W07, which is dated December 2nd,\n2012, that is ancient,\n\n683\n00:31:39.391 --> 00:31:44.387\nand then I've got a backup system ROM\nthat is showing May 5th 2011, right?\n\n684\n00:31:44.387 --> 00:31:47.888\nSo two different versions of the BIOS.\n\n685\n00:31:47.888 --> 00:31:51.379\nIf I do an update right now\nwhich I really need to do,\n\n686\n00:31:51.379 --> 00:31:56.840\nthen it's gonna update the backup and\nthis one becomes the new backup, right?\n\n687\n00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.710\nSo it just alternates.\n\n688\n00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:00.700\nIt rotates between them, to make\nsure that I never flash a bad BIOS.\n\n689\n00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:06.232\nAll right, now most server\nhardware is going to tested and\n\n690\n00:32:06.232 --> 00:32:08.890\nevaluated before it even\nleaves the factory.\n\n691\n00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:12.192\nAnd by the time you get it you're going\nto fire it up and its gonna run fine.\n\n692\n00:32:12.192 --> 00:32:13.760\nAnd then its kind of\nup to us to damage it.\n\n693\n00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.440\nNow, there can be manufacturing defects.\n\n694\n00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:15.992\nAnd that happens.\n\n695\n00:32:15.992 --> 00:32:18.930\nBut there's things that we can\ndo that cause the failures too.\n\n696\n00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:20.860\nFor example, environmental issues.\n\n697\n00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:21.380\nRight?\nAnd\n\n698\n00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.060\ncompTIA calls out several of the big ones.\n\n699\n00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.940\nDust, that we talked about in\nthe server maintenance episodes.\n\n700\n00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.740\nTemperature which we also talked\nabout in server maintenance.\n\n701\n00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.710\nThose are all things that can\nlead to damage on the servers.\n\n702\n00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:34.980\nYou've got to make sure\nthe environment around your servers is\n\n703\n00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.500\ncapable of sustaining those servers.\n\n704\n00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.450\nIf its not it's gonna\nshorten their life span.\n\n705\n00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:41.130\nIts gonna lead to them failing much,\nmuch sooner.\n\n706\n00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:44.003\nThe temperature around your servers,\nhumidity,\n\n707\n00:32:44.003 --> 00:32:46.958\nand just power surges,\npower failures in general.\n\n708\n00:32:46.958 --> 00:32:48.602\nThose are very jarring\nexperiences to a server.\n\n709\n00:32:48.602 --> 00:32:52.120\nSo that's why we don't normally plug\na server right in to a wall socket.\n\n710\n00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.070\nWe normally run to a UPS that's\ndoing power conditioning, right?\n\n711\n00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:57.064\nThat power conditioning\nis really important for\n\n712\n00:32:57.064 --> 00:32:58.773\nus to make sure that everything is right.\n\n713\n00:32:58.773 --> 00:33:00.775\nOn the temperature and humidity,\n\n714\n00:33:00.775 --> 00:33:04.233\na lot of times we'll leverage\ndevices like these from APC.\n\n715\n00:33:04.233 --> 00:33:07.927\nThey have temperature and humidity sensors\nthat you can install throughout your data\n\n716\n00:33:07.927 --> 00:33:11.080\ncenter, so that you can spot\nwhen you've got a problem.\n\n717\n00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.170\nA lot of times, the temperature might\nbe just fine in your server room, and\n\n718\n00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:18.310\nyou don't realize that the humidity\nis way to high or way to low.\n\n719\n00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:19.470\nIf the humidity is too high,\n\n720\n00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:22.200\nit can lead to shorts in the equipment\nas well as rust and corrosion.\n\n721\n00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:27.880\nIf humidity is too low, it can lead\nto build-ups in ESD or in static\n\n722\n00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:32.680\nelectricity so that you can accidentally\nshock your systems, and break components.\n\n723\n00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.089\nSo we've always gotta be careful there.\n\n724\n00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:38.920\nSome of the tools of the trade\nwe've already talked about,\n\n725\n00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.710\nwe've talked about multimeters,\nhowever you want to say it.\n\n726\n00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:45.340\nI talked a little bit about\nthe power supply testers.\n\n727\n00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.486\nSimple things that you'll\nwant to keep handy.\n\n728\n00:33:46.486 --> 00:33:48.102\nThings like canned air and vacuums.\n\n729\n00:33:48.102 --> 00:33:51.350\nI know we've talked about\nthose in other episodes too.\n\n730\n00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:54.740\nBut most of us have seen or\nused canned air.\n\n731\n00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.240\nAt some point,\nit's not fancy technology, right.\n\n732\n00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.340\nWe just spray it and it blows dust off.\n\n733\n00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:05.660\nMake sure that you're using canned air\nthat is okay for electrical components.\n\n734\n00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:08.300\nThere is some canned air out there\nthat isn't, but most of it is and\n\n735\n00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.870\nyou can spray dust and\nother debris right off the system.\n\n736\n00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:12.510\nReally helps for air flow.\n\n737\n00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:16.220\nIf you need to go up to a vacuum cleaner\nor you want an electronic version of that,\n\n738\n00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.240\nthey do make them.\n\n739\n00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:20.110\nMake sure that they're ESD safe, right?\n\n740\n00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:22.500\nCanned air is nice cuz\nthere's no electricity in it.\n\n741\n00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:26.460\nBut when you use a plug in vacuum or\na plug in duster like this one.\n\n742\n00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.480\nThis is like canned air\nthat lasts forever.\n\n743\n00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.560\nIt can generate static electricity.\n\n744\n00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.220\nSee, it even comes with ESD wristband.\n\n745\n00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:36.020\nThat's because we need to\nhave stuff that is rated\n\n746\n00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:39.200\nto support our servers and equipment.\n\n747\n00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.165\nI think I've pretty much\ncovered all the tests there.\n\n748\n00:34:42.165 --> 00:34:44.990\nHardware diagnostics I talked about also.\n\n749\n00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:47.770\nAll of these are different components,\nall tools of the trade.\n\n750\n00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:50.420\nBut fortunately for us as long as\nour system is under maintenance,\n\n751\n00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:53.200\ncovered by a warranty, troubleshooting\nhardware is usually pretty easy.\n\n752\n00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.510\nCuz step one, you call a vendor.\n\n753\n00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.910\nAnd you're paying them for\nthat warranty to maintain a system.\n\n754\n00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:03.330\nIt's when a system's not under warranty or\nwhen a system is custom built, that's when\n\n755\n00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:06.560\nwe have to worry about really getting\nin there and diagnosing the hardware.\n\n756\n00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:10.120\nAnd you wanna make sure you choose\nhardware that supports that.\n\n757\n00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:13.020\nIf you're gonna support your own systems,\nyou might wanna go a standard ATX power\n\n758\n00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:17.360\nsupplies because you can do power\ntesting with an easy tester.\n\n759\n00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:17.940\nThat kind of stuff.\n\n760\n00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.100\nThose are decisions we have to make when\nwe custom build our server hardware.\n\n761\n00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.350\nThat's a great piece of advice there.\n\n762\n00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:24.790\nIf you've got a warranty,\nlet them fix it, not you!\n\n763\n00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, one thing I see, Don here,\n\n764\n00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.140\nis that we are coming to\nthe end of another episode.\n\n765\n00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.040\nDoes look like we're running\na little bit low on time.\n\n766\n00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.280\nBut before we wrap this one up,\n\n767\n00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.890\ndo you have any additional words that\nyou'd like to impart to our viewers?\n\n768\n00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:37.950\n&gt;&gt; Remember that not ever\nvendor is created equal.\n\n769\n00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:41.140\nAnd you might find that you have really\ngreat luck with one vendor, and not so\n\n770\n00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:42.300\nmuch luck with another one.\n\n771\n00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:46.330\nSo always try out the different vendors\nbefore selecting one to stick with.\n\n772\n00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:50.020\nBut when you buy a server, don't just\nlook for the functions of that server.\n\n773\n00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.010\nLook for\nthe support that's built around it.\n\n774\n00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:53.451\nSo for example, I really like HPE.\n\n775\n00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:55.260\nThey have these great diagnostic disks and\n\n776\n00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.850\nstuff that make it super easy to\ntroubleshoot and maintain their servers.\n\n777\n00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:00.460\nI really appreciate that.\n\n778\n00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:04.860\nThere's other systems out there,\ncompanies out there, like System x where\n\n779\n00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:08.650\nthey had these kind of generic\nservers they sell at a very low cost.\n\n780\n00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:11.690\nAnd you don't get any of that support,\nsoftware that comes along with it.\n\n781\n00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:15.770\nIt's good hardware, but if you have\nproblems, you're kinda left on your own.\n\n782\n00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:16.750\nYou get what you pay for, right?\n\n783\n00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:19.600\nMake sure that you choose equipment\nthat's gonna be reliable.\n\n784\n00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.410\nIt may be more expensive, but\nthe reduced downtime will be worth it.\n\n785\n00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:26.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, well we appreciate\nyou being here in the studios with us.\n\n786\n00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.590\nAnd we appreciate you,\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n787\n00:36:28.590 -->

00:00:08.466\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:12.078\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:14.630\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.610\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we are continuing through our\n\n7\n00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.520\nCompTIA Server+ SK0004 certification.\n\n8\n00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.710\nAnd joining us back in the studios\nagain is none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.540\nDon, how ya doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.550\n&gt;&gt; I am great, Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.168\nReady to have another magical time\ntroubleshooting hardware, software, and\n\n12\n00:00:31.168 --> 00:00:33.549\nall sorts of other crazy\nstuff in CompTIA Server+.\n\n13\n00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:35.933\nIn this episode,\nwe are gonna be focusing on software and\n\n14\n00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.710\nsome of the issues that creep up.\n\n15\n00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.405\nI know in the hardware episode, I made\nthe comment that fortunately with servers,\n\n16\n00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:46.039\nthey're built to a higher level\nof quality than workstations.\n\n17\n00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.855\nAnd so we have less failures as a result,\nand we have longer warranties.\n\n18\n00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:51.444\nSo we have vendors that can help us.\n\n19\n00:00:51.444 --> 00:00:54.828\nAnd so, troubleshooting hardware is\nreally actually not that big of a deal\n\n20\n00:00:54.828 --> 00:00:55.430\non a server.\n\n21\n00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.828\nSoftware though, is a different story.\n\n22\n00:00:59.828 --> 00:01:02.759\nSoftware has a lot of moving parts,\na lot of ones and zeros,\n\n23\n00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:06.110\na lot of different people\ninvolved in the development.\n\n24\n00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.840\nAnd a lot of the time,\nthe people developing the software\n\n25\n00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.250\ndon't have access to the same\nhardware that we do.\n\n26\n00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.540\nAnd when you put the two together,\nthat's where the magic happens, right?\n\n27\n00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.200\nThat's where things don't necessarily\nbehave the way we expect them to behave,\n\n28\n00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.520\nand we've got to get in there and\ntroubleshoot.\n\n29\n00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.130\nSo if you think about the two primary\nserver operating systems that are out\n\n30\n00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.160\nthere, Linux and Windows.\n\n31\n00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.201\nWell, Microsoft as a commercial entity,\nthey make a ton of money, right?\n\n32\n00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:35.530\nAnd their operating system is very\nentrenched in the business world.\n\n33\n00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.325\nSo in small and medium businesses,\nit's almost entirely Windows environments.\n\n34\n00:01:39.325 --> 00:01:41.240\nAnd when you get into large and\n\n35\n00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.660\nenterprise organizations, their\nworkstations are almost entirely Windows.\n\n36\n00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.600\nTheir servers, not so much, right?\n\n37\n00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.900\nOn the server side, we see a lot of Linux\ngrowth, in the enterprise market, and\n\n38\n00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.370\non the internet as a whole.\n\n39\n00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.753\nMost of the websites that you go\nto these days are Linux driven.\n\n40\n00:01:55.753 --> 00:01:58.160\nYou're watching this show right now.\n\n41\n00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.590\nThe video streaming servers,\nthe web servers,\n\n42\n00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.860\nthe encoders that are making all of this\nhappen, everyone of them is running Linux.\n\n43\n00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.072\nI don't think there's a Windows\nsystem in that work flow.\n\n44\n00:02:08.072 --> 00:02:12.190\nThere's a couple of Macs somewhere for\nediting, but the rest of it's all Linux.\n\n45\n00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.040\nSo, very common on that server side.\n\n46\n00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.152\nNow, on the Microsoft side,\nbecause they generate so much revenue,\n\n47\n00:02:18.152 --> 00:02:22.961\nvendors like Dell and HP and Lenovo, they\nall work to make sure that their hardware\n\n48\n00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:25.416\nis compatible with Microsoft software.\n\n49\n00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:28.302\nSo they develop drivers and\nthey get that pushed through.\n\n50\n00:02:28.302 --> 00:02:31.040\nOn the Linux side,\nwe don't see that so much.\n\n51\n00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.398\nThat there are some vendors where they\nwill take the time to create the right\n\n52\n00:02:34.398 --> 00:02:37.824\ndrivers to make sure that they're\noperating systems works with hardware.\n\n53\n00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.060\nOr vice-versa, the hardware works for\nthe operating system.\n\n54\n00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.110\nBut they're usually much more selective.\n\n55\n00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.294\nAnd that is where a big part of our\nsoftware troubleshooting is gonna come in.\n\n56\n00:02:46.294 --> 00:02:50.296\nIf I buy a HPE server, and\nI go to their website and I purchase it,\n\n57\n00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:55.740\nI can pretty much guarantee that\nthey're gonna have drivers for Windows.\n\n58\n00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.000\nOn the Linux side, I can guarantee they'll\nhave drivers for Linux too, but not for\n\n59\n00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.590\nevery distro.\n\n60\n00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.620\nRight now,\nthe two most common are Ubuntu Server and\n\n61\n00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.600\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux Server.\n\n62\n00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.360\nSo those are the two main ones, and\nI can expect to see drivers for that.\n\n63\n00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.700\nAfter that, you have OpenSUSE,\n\n64\n00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.870\nis another one that you'll see plenty\nof vendors making drivers for.\n\n65\n00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.130\nBut beyond those three,\nit really becomes a mixed bag.\n\n66\n00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.790\nSo if you're running CentOS, maybe you\ncan use the R-H-E-L drivers, maybe not,\n\n67\n00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.350\nsometimes they work, sometimes they don't.\n\n68\n00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.870\nSometimes there's some proprietory stuff\nin there so they don't release them for\n\n69\n00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.820\nCentOS, and they just do it for R-H-E-L.\n\n70\n00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.832\nIf you're running Arch Linux, or\nSlackware, or any of the myriad other\n\n71\n00:03:34.832 --> 00:03:40.356\ndistributions that are out there,\nhopefully, there's drivers available.\n\n72\n00:03:40.356 --> 00:03:43.833\nBut if not, you may be forced to\ntake drivers that were developed for\n\n73\n00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:47.140\na different distro and try and\nport them over to yours.\n\n74\n00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.780\nAnd that can lead to a lot of trouble, and\n\n75\n00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.850\nthat's where software stops\nbehaving the way we intend to.\n\n76\n00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.541\nBut even when there's the right\ndrivers available, so\n\n77\n00:03:55.541 --> 00:04:00.894\nI buy a new Dell Poweredge Server,\nI install a Windows Server 2016 on there.\n\n78\n00:04:00.894 --> 00:04:05.027\nMicrosoft could still occasionally push\nupdates out, that cause conflicts, and\n\n79\n00:04:05.027 --> 00:04:06.750\nnow I start to have failures.\n\n80\n00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.650\nSo we need to have a good understanding\nof how to troubleshoot software failures,\n\n81\n00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.610\nhow to locate where the issue is.\n\n82\n00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.582\nAnd understand that, while sometimes\nthe problem is just in software,\n\n83\n00:04:15.582 --> 00:04:19.309\nsometimes the problem is combined\nbetween software and hardware.\n\n84\n00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:22.310\nAnd it's the two working together that\nteam up to create the disaster that you\n\n85\n00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.450\nnow have to fix.\n\n86\n00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.317\nSo we're gonna run down a whole laundry\nlist of common problems that we encounter\n\n87\n00:04:27.317 --> 00:04:28.200\non servers.\n\n88\n00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.333\nAnd the different things we do\ntroubleshoot, isolate and correct those.\n\n89\n00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:35.732\n&gt;&gt; Don, it's kind of interesting,\nI was driving in this morning, and\n\n90\n00:04:35.732 --> 00:04:38.088\nI was listening to one\nof our local talk-show.\n\n91\n00:04:38.088 --> 00:04:41.121\nAnd one of the talk show hosts, supposed\nto report on the news in the morning.\n\n92\n00:04:41.121 --> 00:04:44.338\nAnd one of the things he said,\nhe came in at four in the morning and\n\n93\n00:04:44.338 --> 00:04:46.790\nrealized that he hadn't\nchanged his password.\n\n94\n00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:47.541\nSo he said it,\n\n95\n00:04:47.541 --> 00:04:51.628\nnow this is his fault because he said it\nwarned him a week ago and he ignored it.\n\n96\n00:04:51.628 --> 00:04:55.050\nSo he couldn't log on to machines,\nnow that's a user's fault.\n\n97\n00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.200\nHave you seen it, in some cases, where you\ncan't log on, it's not the user's fault?\n\n98\n00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.520\n&gt;&gt; It can certainly happen.\n\n99\n00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.893\nSo in several of the environments\nwhere I've worked,\n\n100\n00:05:04.893 --> 00:05:09.158\nwe've done a thing where we look at\nthe trouble tickets that you get.\n\n101\n00:05:09.158 --> 00:05:13.170\nAnd you try and find what's the most\nfrequent trouble ticket that comes in.\n\n102\n00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.470\nCuz if you can eliminate that trouble,\n\n103\n00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.480\nthat cuts down on your help desk calls,\nright?\n\n104\n00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.599\nSo every six months or\nonce a year, you sit down,\n\n105\n00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:23.031\nyou take a look at all the historic\ntrouble tickets, and you categorize them.\n\n106\n00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:28.080\nAnd every time, the number one ticket is,\nI forgot my password.\n\n107\n00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.040\nOr, I don't know my password, or\nI can't login, my password's not working.\n\n108\n00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.290\nPassword problems are always number one.\n\n109\n00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.000\nEnd users forget their passwords.\n\n110\n00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.260\nNow, end users typically are logging\ninto their own workstation, so\n\n111\n00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.460\nit's kind of their own problem.\n\n112\n00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.920\nBut if they're logging into your servers,\nif they're logging in to check email and\n\n113\n00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.090\nthey can't get in, what's the problem?\n\n114\n00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.000\nWell, typically, it is their fault,\nlike Wes said, right?\n\n115\n00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.524\nThey didn't choose to reset in the window\nthey had, and now the password is expired.\n\n116\n00:05:52.524 --> 00:05:55.800\nOr they forgot their password, or\nsomething of that nature, right?\n\n117\n00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.490\nBut it could on the server side, too.\n\n118\n00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.547\nWhen you log in,\nwhat are you logging in against?\n\n119\n00:06:01.547 --> 00:06:05.039\nWell, if you're logging into a local\naccount, that's not a big deal.\n\n120\n00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.184\nBut if you're logging in against\nan active directory domain,\n\n121\n00:06:08.184 --> 00:06:12.370\nyou've got to be able to talk to\na domain controller, to authenticate.\n\n122\n00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.650\nAnd it's possible that that's not working,\nthat's not functioning.\n\n123\n00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.350\nNow, when you have a problem like that,\n\n124\n00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.740\nit's easy to test,\ncuz you can try with your own account.\n\n125\n00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.330\nIt wouldn't just affect that one end user.\n\n126\n00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.240\nIf the email server is no longer\nable to talk to your directory,\n\n127\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.120\nthen you won't be able to log in either.\n\n128\n00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.660\nSo we can always verify that, and\nthat goes back to the eight step\n\n129\n00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.820\ntroubleshooting methodology\nthat COMPTIA has.\n\n130\n00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.250\nStep one is verify the scope, and\nthe scope is, who all's affected?\n\n131\n00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.110\nI know this end user's affected\ncuz they told me, am I affected?\n\n132\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.620\nWell, are the salespeople,\nare the marketing people,\n\n133\n00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.700\nare people on the fifth floor, or people\non the second floor, who all is affected?\n\n134\n00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.890\nAnd if it's a problem on the server,\n\n135\n00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.890\nit's gonna affect everybody that's\nconnecting to that server to log in.\n\n136\n00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.860\nUnless it's something simple\nlike an expired password,\n\n137\n00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.690\nwhich is only going to\naffect the one user.\n\n138\n00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.876\nSo the scope helps us to figure out\nwhether that's gonna be a problem on\n\n139\n00:07:00.876 --> 00:07:01.475\nthe server.\n\n140\n00:07:01.475 --> 00:07:04.570\nWe really don't even have to\ntroubleshoot much farther beyond that.\n\n141\n00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.913\nIf we aren't able to connect\nto the domain controller or\n\n142\n00:07:07.913 --> 00:07:10.985\nthe OpenLDAP server or\nwhatever it is that we have.\n\n143\n00:07:10.985 --> 00:07:12.877\nWell, that's typically when we switch, and\n\n144\n00:07:12.877 --> 00:07:15.840\nwe start doing things like network\ntroubleshooting and so on.\n\n145\n00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.610\nNow, with most of these troubleshooting\nsteps, I'll tell you guys,\n\n146\n00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.365\nthere's one place that I usually go\nto first, and that's my system logs.\n\n147\n00:07:24.365 --> 00:07:26.430\nThat if I'm not able to connect\nto a domain controller, or\n\n148\n00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.110\nif I'm not able to connect to OpenLDAP or\nwhatever my directory service is,\n\n149\n00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.840\nthere will usually be entries\nin the system logs for that.\n\n150\n00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.673\nAnd depending on the operating system I'm\nrunning, those are different places, so\n\n151\n00:07:35.673 --> 00:07:37.920\nlet's take a look at those\nsystem logs real quick.\n\n152\n00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.587\nSo here I'm on a Windows 2012 R2 machine,\nwhich it's the same on 2016.\n\n153\n00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:47.080\nThat we can go into our Server Manager,\nand we can jump into our Tools, and\n\n154\n00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.198\nwe have the Event Viewer, right?\n\n155\n00:07:49.198 --> 00:07:54.113\nThe Event Viewer, which has been a staple\npart of Windows since NT4, I believe is,\n\n156\n00:07:54.113 --> 00:07:57.312\nit might have been in NT351,\nbut I don't think so.\n\n157\n00:07:57.312 --> 00:07:59.596\nI think Windows NT4 is where it started,\nso\n\n158\n00:07:59.596 --> 00:08:03.128\nthis has been helping me troubleshoot\nproblems for 20 years now.\n\n159\n00:08:03.128 --> 00:08:07.274\nAnd it's just a great place to go and\nfind information.\n\n160\n00:08:07.274 --> 00:08:11.460\nYou have these Windows logs, and in\nthe Windows logs, you have the System log.\n\n161\n00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.310\nIt's probably the most important one, that\nwe can jump right into the System log, and\n\n162\n00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:19.980\nif we're pulling errors on the system,\nthey'll show up in here.\n\n163\n00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.540\nAnd shockingly,\nI appear to be error free right now.\n\n164\n00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:28.310\nBut what I'll often do is,\nlet's just pretend,\n\n165\n00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.120\nright, that you call me one day and\nyou say, hey Don I need some help.\n\n166\n00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.620\nI got this server that's acting up,\nhere's the symptoms.\n\n167\n00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.700\nI'll come over to the server.\n\n168\n00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.940\nI'll pull up the event log just like this,\nand I'll just do a quick filter.\n\n169\n00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.250\nYou've got these little filters over here,\nso I can filter the current log and\n\n170\n00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.240\nI'll tell it hey,\njust show me errors and warnings.\n\n171\n00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.039\nI just want to see errors and warnings.\n\n172\n00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:50.594\nAnd by doing that I can apply that filter,\nand now,\n\n173\n00:08:50.594 --> 00:08:54.510\nI see any kind of red flags\nthat have been thrown up.\n\n174\n00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.780\nA moment ago, I said I thought\nthe server might be error free.\n\n175\n00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.740\nNow, I can recognize that it wasn't.\n\n176\n00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.440\nAlthough I can see none of these\nerrors have happened today, right?\n\n177\n00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.838\nToday is January 26,\nThese are all from January 17.\n\n178\n00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:09.500\nSo January 17th was probably\na pretty bad day for me,\n\n179\n00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.800\nbut today my server isn't\nthrowing any errors.\n\n180\n00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.550\nBut if it were,\nI can come in here and locate it.\n\n181\n00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.010\nSo here I've got some service\ncontrol errors, for example.\n\n182\n00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.860\nAnd just seeing the error\ndoesn't really help me.\n\n183\n00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.300\nA service control error,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n184\n00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.950\nIt means that some service didn't start.\n\n185\n00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.290\nWonderful, right?\n\n186\n00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.220\nNow, there's a couple of services\nthat are involved in authentication.\n\n187\n00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.677\nAnd I have a user who can't log in,\n\n188\n00:09:31.677 --> 00:09:34.650\nit's possible one of these\nservices is not running, right?\n\n189\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.420\nBut I don't know which service it is.\n\n190\n00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.010\nI have to dig into that\nerror a little bit,\n\n191\n00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.905\nand then we can find out a little more.\n\n192\n00:09:39.905 --> 00:09:42.465\nAnd so when I look at this, I can see that\na timeout was reached while waiting for\n\n193\n00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:46.015\nthe QEMU Guest Agent Service to connect.\n\n194\n00:09:46.015 --> 00:09:48.850\nThis virtual machine is\nrunning on top of QEMU.\n\n195\n00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.817\nIt's actually running on top\nof a Red Hat environment.\n\n196\n00:09:51.817 --> 00:09:55.995\nAnd so, its throwing up an error here that\nit was trying to communicate with the KVM.\n\n197\n00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:58.540\nWell, this was a new virtual machine.\n\n198\n00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.740\nI probably hadn't installed the virtual\nmachine drivers for it, yet.\n\n199\n00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.130\nAnd once I installed those drivers,\nit corrected this issue,\n\n200\n00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.050\nwhich is more than likely why we're\nnot seeing that error anymore.\n\n201\n00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.710\nThese were all back on the 17th which\nis probably when I created this\n\n202\n00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.050\nvirtual machine.\n\n203\n00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:12.600\nAnd now that's all been resolved.\n\n204\n00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.280\nSo that kind of thing happens.\n\n205\n00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.330\nSome of these are warnings that\nyou don't have to act upon,\n\n206\n00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.240\nthey're just there to let you know that\nthis might be a problem down the road.\n\n207\n00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.642\nBut errors, those are ones that\nare problems right now that need to get\n\n208\n00:10:24.642 --> 00:10:26.760\nresolved, and we normally spot those.\n\n209\n00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.010\n&gt;&gt; Don, is there any importance to that\nfourth column over there that it says\n\n210\n00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:30.730\nthe event ID?\n\n211\n00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.700\nIs that relevant to us and\nif we're doing troubleshooting?\n\n212\n00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.105\n&gt;&gt; Yes and no.\n\n213\n00:10:35.105 --> 00:10:39.040\nWhat's supposed to happen is whenever\na developer generates software, and\n\n214\n00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.690\nthe software generates an error, they're\nsupposed to give it an error number and\n\n215\n00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:43.700\na description.\n\n216\n00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.310\nIf it's got a good description,\n\n217\n00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.660\nlike the one that I just pulled up here,\nthat was a pretty good description.\n\n218\n00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.595\nI know what's going on, right?\n\n219\n00:10:50.595 --> 00:10:54.790\nThis service, DbxSvc failed to\nstart due to the following error,\n\n220\n00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.370\nthe system cannot find the file specified.\n\n221\n00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:58.480\nThat's pretty handy.\n\n222\n00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.250\nI know that that program tried to start,\ntried to find the file and\n\n223\n00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.710\ncouldn't find the file.\n\n224\n00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.230\nAll right, that means something.\n\n225\n00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:09.260\nBut sometimes you open these up, and\nthe error doesn't mean anything.\n\n226\n00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.817\nYou open it and\nit says something dumb, like,\n\n227\n00:11:11.817 --> 00:11:15.240\nthat one's not dumb that\none means something.\n\n228\n00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.110\nI was hoping to find one that\ndidn't mean anything, but\n\n229\n00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.820\nmost of these seem to\nbe pretty good today.\n\n230\n00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.840\nSometimes you'll find one that it'll just\nsay like, encountered error number 742.\n\n231\n00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.190\nOk, great.\n\n232\n00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.940\nOr, service encountered an error.\n\n233\n00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.315\nWell I know, there's an event message.\n\n234\n00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.144\nI know it encountered an error,\nwhy don't you tell me about the error?\n\n235\n00:11:32.144 --> 00:11:33.077\nAnd it doesn't tell you.\n\n236\n00:11:33.077 --> 00:11:35.664\nSo when a developer throws\none of these errors up,\n\n237\n00:11:35.664 --> 00:11:39.220\nthe only thing they actually have\nto provide is that Event ID.\n\n238\n00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.370\nThen you can use that to\ncross-reference the error.\n\n239\n00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.650\nMicrosoft puts out advisories\non a lot of these.\n\n240\n00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.400\nSee how I've got this\nEvent Log Online Help?\n\n241\n00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.230\nAnd it'll run that Event ID number, and\nbounce it against Microsoft's website.\n\n242\n00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:56.020\nSee how it's about to send it\nup here with Event ID 10149?\n\n243\n00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.610\nAnd I can take that and say,\nyep, send it to Microsoft, and\n\n244\n00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.010\nit's going to pop that up and\n\n245\n00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:05.260\nsee if Microsoft already knows what the\nproblem is, and can suggest a fix, right?\n\n246\n00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.226\nIn my case, apparently,\nthey're gonna sell me a laptop.\n\n247\n00:12:08.226 --> 00:12:09.460\nSo, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, you have been saying Don,\n\n248\n00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.140\nin their defense, throw money at it,\nit makes every situation better.\n\n249\n00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:12.750\n&gt;&gt; That is true.\n\n250\n00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.040\nBuying a new laptop might solve\nthis problem or it might not.\n\n251\n00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.850\nMy users probably still won't be able\nto log in after I buy a new laptop.\n\n252\n00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.550\nMore than likely,\nI got the wrong page there, cuz\n\n253\n00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.680\nI'm launching a web browser on a server,\nwhich is not something we should do.\n\n254\n00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.900\nInstead, I should be running the event\nlogs from my own work station and\n\n255\n00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.320\nconnecting, remotely, to the server,\nand launching it that way.\n\n256\n00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.690\nBut either way, so, we can use\nthis to find out that information.\n\n257\n00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:38.660\nAnd Microsoft has it like this,\nOS 10 has it in their server app.\n\n258\n00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.240\nAnd in Linux, we have it through\nthe regular syslog mechanism,\n\n259\n00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.840\nwhich is present in every Linux distro.\n\n260\n00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.160\nSo for example, if I jump over here, this\nis a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server, so\n\n261\n00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.980\nit's running RHEL 7, and\non these guys, they do the same thing.\n\n262\n00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.570\nThey have a service log, right?\n\n263\n00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.780\nAnd, Microsoft got\nthe idea from somewhere.\n\n264\n00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.360\nWhere'd they get the idea from?\n\n265\n00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.100\nFrom Unix,\n\n266\n00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.390\nwhich is what Linux is modeled after,\nso it's really all kind of the same.\n\n267\n00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:08.670\nBut if you ever poke around in /var/log\non pretty much any Linux distro,\n\n268\n00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.810\nyou'll find all sorts\nof log files in there.\n\n269\n00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.100\nAnd that systems log I\nshowed you under Windows,\n\n270\n00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.760\nthat corresponds to the messages\nlog here on a Linux box.\n\n271\n00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.940\nOr on a BSD box, it'd be the same on BSD.\n\n272\n00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:25.513\nSo what I'm looking at here is basically\nthe system log, or it's the sys log for\n\n273\n00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:26.840\nthe system.\n\n274\n00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:32.989\nAnd if I do a more or less,\nI usually use less /var/log/messages,\n\n275\n00:13:32.989 --> 00:13:36.387\nI can go in there, and I can look at it.\n\n276\n00:13:36.387 --> 00:13:40.247\nBut I do need to be an administrator,\nso I do sudu up for that one.\n\n277\n00:13:40.247 --> 00:13:42.320\nAnd here I can start seeing messages.\n\n278\n00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.710\nI can see dp laptop system\nd started session 15.\n\n279\n00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.720\nThis is when the system was booting up.\n\n280\n00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.070\nOn January 12th, right, so\nI started this thing 14 days ago.\n\n281\n00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:55.520\nAnd I can sit here and scroll through it,\nwhich could take forever.\n\n282\n00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.190\nBut since I used less,\nI can use the search functionality here.\n\n283\n00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:03.070\nI can do a forward slash,\nwhich says look for a string, and\n\n284\n00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:07.097\nI can do a search for /Error, right?\n\n285\n00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:11.980\nOr we can use regular expressions,\nbecause Error might start with an E, or\n\n286\n00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.640\nit might start with a lowercase e.\n\n287\n00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.060\nI don't really know, and so\nI can tell it to search for both.\n\n288\n00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.370\nAnd search like that.\n\n289\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:19.680\nAnd now it's gonna look and\n\n290\n00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.640\nshow me anywhere where it\nencounters the word error.\n\n291\n00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.560\nAnd so I can spot that and find it here.\n\n292\n00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.540\nI had a gnome session error right here.\n\n293\n00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.610\nIt was trying to access\na LibreOffice file on my desktop.\n\n294\n00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:35.500\nAnd I got a no mime type extractor\nhandler for uri blah, blah, blah.\n\n295\n00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:41.040\nSo, apparently, I didn't have something\nin place to open up a x compressed tar.\n\n296\n00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.383\nSo I had to get an app for\nthat, which I probably did,\n\n297\n00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:47.191\none of these next messages will probably\nmean installing something to open that up.\n\n298\n00:14:47.191 --> 00:14:50.360\nBut you can search through here and\nfind that information.\n\n299\n00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:55.330\nUsually what I do for this,\nis I use the tail command.\n\n300\n00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.480\nThe tail command will show you the last,\n\n301\n00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.800\nby default it does the last\nten lines of a file.\n\n302\n00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.720\nSo I can come in here and\nsay, tail /var/log/messages.\n\n303\n00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.370\nShow me the last ten.\n\n304\n00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.750\nBecause if I just recreated the error,\nit'll be there in the last ten, right?\n\n305\n00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.624\nOr we can even go a step further and\nI can add -f.\n\n306\n00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:19.300\nWhich says, show me the last ten,\nand follow the file.\n\n307\n00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.980\nSo now it's gonna follow it.\n\n308\n00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.800\nAnd I can go and recreate the problem.\n\n309\n00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.020\nAnd as the messages get generated,\nthey'll display on the screen.\n\n310\n00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.390\nIt's gonna display it in real time.\n\n311\n00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.340\nI'll see them popping up as they come in,\nwhich is kind of a neat way to do that.\n\n312\n00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.340\nSo those are some utilities that\nare available to view those logs.\n\n313\n00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.630\nAnd when we have things\nlike authentication errors,\n\n314\n00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.530\nwatching these log files is the best place\nto go, because you'll see a message in\n\n315\n00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:43.180\nthere that'll kind of tip you off\nin the right direction to look.\n\n316\n00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:47.520\nAll right, the same thing goes really for\nour second common problem, which is,\n\n317\n00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.440\nuser can't access a resource.\n\n318\n00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.840\nIf a user can't log in,\nthey can't access a resource.\n\n319\n00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.370\nBut, there are scenarios\nwhere they can log in,\n\n320\n00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.870\nand they still can't access the resource.\n\n321\n00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.360\nAnd those almost always\nboil down to permissions.\n\n322\n00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.817\nWhen you log in, you're authenticating.\n\n323\n00:16:03.817 --> 00:16:07.039\nYou're proving that you\nare who you say you are.\n\n324\n00:16:07.039 --> 00:16:11.730\nBut authentication is only one\npart of the security model, right.\n\n325\n00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:16.100\nWe really have a triple A, a three\nA model, sometimes people say four A,\n\n326\n00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.890\nbut three's the basics.\n\n327\n00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:21.790\nWe have authentication which is\nproving you are who you say you are.\n\n328\n00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:26.480\nYou have authorization, now that we know\nwho you are, what are you allowed to do?\n\n329\n00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.030\nWhat are you authorized\nto perform on the system?\n\n330\n00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.380\nAnd then we have accounting,\n\n331\n00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.750\nwhat kind of records are we\ngonna keep of your activities?\n\n332\n00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.580\nAn accounting might be\ncompletely turned off.\n\n333\n00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.860\nA lot of systems don't use it,\n\n334\n00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.500\nlike Windows has very little\naccounting by default.\n\n335\n00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.130\nBut we can crank that up and\ndo a lot more if we want.\n\n336\n00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.850\nEvery system uses permissions.\n\n337\n00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:50.060\nWhen I take a look at a file right,\nso let's say I create a file,\n\n338\n00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.533\nfile.txt, and I look at that file.\n\n339\n00:16:55.645 --> 00:16:58.750\nI'm gonna see some default\npermissions assigned to it.\n\n340\n00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:02.100\nAnd in the Unix world,\npermissions are written out like this.\n\n341\n00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.420\nThese first couple of blocks here\nare all talking about permissions, okay.\n\n342\n00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.710\nI can see who's the owner.\n\n343\n00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.330\nMe, dpezet.\n\n344\n00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:10.650\nWho's the group.\n\n345\n00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.860\nWell, a group called dpezet.\n\n346\n00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:17.010\nAnd then,\nwhat permissions does the owner have?\n\n347\n00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.700\nThe group have?\n\n348\n00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.370\nAnd everybody else who's not the owner or\ngroup, right?\n\n349\n00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:26.660\nAnd so, we can see who's in control of\nthat file, who's allowed to access it.\n\n350\n00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.640\nAnd if I'm the owner,\nI'm gonna get read and write.\n\n351\n00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:34.610\nIf I'm not the owner, but I'm in\nthe dpezet group, I'll get read and write.\n\n352\n00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.250\nBut if I'm not the owner or\nin the group, I'm gonna get read only.\n\n353\n00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.690\nAnd I might get a ticket from an end user\nsaying, hey I can open this file but\n\n354\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:42.680\nany time I try to change it,\n\n355\n00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.690\nit tells me permission denied,\nI can't access the resource, or whatever.\n\n356\n00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.000\nI'm trying to open a file and\nI can't even open it.\n\n357\n00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.100\nRight, maybe we don't have that access,\nthe permissions that were assigned here\n\n358\n00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:58.370\nare really kind of determined by us.\n\n359\n00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.731\nSo when I Define a file,\nlike what I just did there,\n\n360\n00:18:01.731 --> 00:18:04.476\nI changed the permissions on file.txt.\n\n361\n00:18:04.476 --> 00:18:09.430\nI made it where if you were the owner,\nyou can read, write and execute the file.\n\n362\n00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:10.730\nMaybe it's a script.\n\n363\n00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:15.310\nIf you are in the dpezet group,\nyou can read it and execute it, but\n\n364\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:16.400\nyou can't change it.\n\n365\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.400\nAnd if you're anybody else,\nyou get nothing.\n\n366\n00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.670\nNo ability to access whatsoever.\n\n367\n00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:25.350\nSo in this scenario I might get\na call from somebody saying,\n\n368\n00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:26.760\nI can't find that file I'm looking for.\n\n369\n00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.250\nI know it's there, other people are in it,\nbut I can't get to it.\n\n370\n00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.100\nAnd it turns out to be permissions.\n\n371\n00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:35.780\nNow, manipulating permissions in the Unix\nworld is done with the change mod command,\n\n372\n00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:36.880\nor chmod, right?\n\n373\n00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.430\nAnd you have various bits.\n\n374\n00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.340\nIf you've watched our Linux+ show,\n\n375\n00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.280\nwe go into that really in-depth,\non how to set all those permissions.\n\n376\n00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.600\nIn the Windows world, it's a little\nbit easier if you've got the GUI.\n\n377\n00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.970\nIf you've got like a core\ninstall on a server,\n\n378\n00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:52.560\nyou can always use a client to connect,\nand you'll have a GUI that way.\n\n379\n00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.926\nAnd in the Windows world you\nbasically just take a folder, so\n\n380\n00:18:55.926 --> 00:18:57.912\nlet's say I make a new folder here.\n\n381\n00:19:00.137 --> 00:19:03.830\nI'll whip up a quick folder,\nwhich I'll call Test.\n\n382\n00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.520\nAnd then I can pull up\nthe properties on that folder and\n\n383\n00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:11.390\ngo to the securities tab and right\nhere I can define who has what access.\n\n384\n00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:15.640\nAnd I can say whoever the owner is,\nwhich in this case is gonna be me,\n\n385\n00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.935\nbecause I just made it.\n\n386\n00:19:16.935 --> 00:19:19.825\nI can then see down here what\nthe owner's permissions are going to be,\n\n387\n00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:22.665\nwhich is apparently special, right?\n\n388\n00:19:22.665 --> 00:19:23.985\nUsually it's full control.\n\n389\n00:19:23.985 --> 00:19:27.665\nBut I can see that users are going\nto have read and execute and read,\n\n390\n00:19:27.665 --> 00:19:29.615\nbut not the ability to write.\n\n391\n00:19:29.615 --> 00:19:32.115\nAnd I might need to come in and\nchange these permissions.\n\n392\n00:19:32.115 --> 00:19:35.595\nNow, I like the way that CompTIA worded\nit in the objectives where they said\n\n393\n00:19:35.595 --> 00:19:37.600\nuser cannot access resources.\n\n394\n00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.920\nBecause it's not just files and folders,\noften times I'll think files and\n\n395\n00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.980\nfolders but\nit's not just files and folders.\n\n396\n00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.630\nIt could be things like printers, right?\n\n397\n00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.560\nPrinters have permissions\ntoo that if I were to jump\n\n398\n00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:54.140\ninto the printers screen\nwhich I think I can get to.\n\n399\n00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.270\nThere we go.\n\n400\n00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:59.980\nThat we can take a printer like this\nMicrosoft XPS Document Writer which is\n\n401\n00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.320\na virtual printer.\n\n402\n00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.695\nAnd I can go into\nthe printer properties and\n\n403\n00:20:03.695 --> 00:20:07.300\nit's got a security tab,\nwhere we can set access, right.\n\n404\n00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:11.630\nSo that's another place where we might\nhave to look for access that resource.\n\n405\n00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:15.020\nAnd even beyond that, in the networking\nepisode I'm gonna talk about\n\n406\n00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.840\nhow firewalls can interfere\nwith the connectivity.\n\n407\n00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.320\nAnd so it could be that maybe\nthey have permission but\n\n408\n00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:25.440\nthey can't even get to the server\nwhere that resource is being hosted.\n\n409\n00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.750\nWhen you think about how\na user is accessing resources,\n\n410\n00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.170\nit helps sometimes to draw a diagram.\n\n411\n00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:33.530\nTo figure out, what's all the stuff they\npass through on the way to that resource.\n\n412\n00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:35.650\nAnd where are they getting cut off?\n\n413\n00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:36.549\nWhere are they losing that access?\n\n414\n00:20:38.885 --> 00:20:43.410\nAll right, the next one is one that\nI've always had a lot of fun with.\n\n415\n00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.040\nAnd that's a memory leak.\n\n416\n00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.840\nNow if you're not familiar\nwith a memory leak,\n\n417\n00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.880\nwhat you might find is that occasionally,\nyour server locks up.\n\n418\n00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.500\nUsers call in and\nthey say the server's running really slow.\n\n419\n00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.310\nOr they call in and they say, hey,\nI can't get into that server.\n\n420\n00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:59.745\nAnd you go in and you look at the server,\nand it's just completely frozen.\n\n421\n00:20:59.745 --> 00:21:02.315\nAnd you can't do much, you reboot it.\n\n422\n00:21:02.315 --> 00:21:05.275\nAnd you reboot it and everything is fine.\n\n423\n00:21:05.275 --> 00:21:07.635\nWell, a reboot is not magic.\n\n424\n00:21:07.635 --> 00:21:11.605\nA reboot doesn't solve all the world's\nproblems but it seems like it sometimes.\n\n425\n00:21:11.605 --> 00:21:14.065\nWhat a reboot does is it solves\nthe symptom but not the cause.\n\n426\n00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:16.755\nWhy did the system lock\nup in the first place?\n\n427\n00:21:16.755 --> 00:21:19.815\nWell, the number one reason,\nit runs out of RAM.\n\n428\n00:21:19.815 --> 00:21:20.375\nThat can happen.\n\n429\n00:21:20.375 --> 00:21:22.165\nYour system can run out of memory.\n\n430\n00:21:22.165 --> 00:21:25.240\nNow we don't normally just\nrun out of physical memory.\n\n431\n00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.160\nMost systems have multiple\nlevels of memory.\n\n432\n00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.240\nYou've got physical memory and\n\n433\n00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.030\nvirtual memory that combine\nto create your total memory.\n\n434\n00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.353\nSo for example, on this Windows machine,\nif I bring up the task manager.\n\n435\n00:21:35.081 --> 00:21:39.580\nAnd go into my details and performance.\n\n436\n00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:40.630\nHere we go.\n\n437\n00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.780\nI can come in and\nlook at it and go to memory.\n\n438\n00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:43.780\nAnd right down here,\n\n439\n00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:48.870\nI'm gonna see that I have a certain amount\nof memory available in this system, right?\n\n440\n00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.630\nUp here it's telling me my memory.\n\n441\n00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.290\nI have 2 GB of ram in this server.\n\n442\n00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:59.172\nAnd then down here I can see that I have\n950 MB in use, and 1.1 GB available.\n\n443\n00:21:59.172 --> 00:22:02.456\nSo I'm running at about 50% memory\nutilization which is really a sweet spot\n\n444\n00:22:02.456 --> 00:22:03.060\nfor a server.\n\n445\n00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.900\nThat's kind of where you want it to be.\n\n446\n00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.750\nIf you're consistently over 80%,\nit's time to upgrade.\n\n447\n00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:11.712\nIf you're consistently below 30%,\nyou're usually wasting resources,\n\n448\n00:22:11.712 --> 00:22:13.463\nyou get memory you're not using.\n\n449\n00:22:13.463 --> 00:22:16.140\nBut if you're constantly at 50%,\nthat's a good place to be.\n\n450\n00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.077\nSo, I'm happy with that number.\n\n451\n00:22:18.077 --> 00:22:20.228\nBut then if you look down here,\nlook at my committed number.\n\n452\n00:22:20.228 --> 00:22:25.450\nI've committed 1.1 GB out of 3.1 GB.\n\n453\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:26.970\nYou go, wait a minute, 3.1 GB?\n\n454\n00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.530\nIt told me right here\nI have 2 GB of memory.\n\n455\n00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.320\nHow can I commit 3 GB of memory?\n\n456\n00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.449\nWell, I've got physical memory and\nvirtual memory.\n\n457\n00:22:35.449 --> 00:22:37.660\nMy physical memory is this 2 GB.\n\n458\n00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:42.150\nAnd then I have another virtual\nGB of memory somewhere.\n\n459\n00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:43.850\nWell, where does that come from?\n\n460\n00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:45.450\nThat's my page file.\n\n461\n00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.480\nMost systems have an overflow that says,\nhey,\n\n462\n00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:52.380\nif we run out of physical RAM,\nwe can use the disk storage as memory.\n\n463\n00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.900\nNow, disk storage is always slower,\nso we don't want that to happen.\n\n464\n00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.740\nIf you see yourself using that disk\nstorage too much, you're gonna have a slow\n\n465\n00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.230\nserver, and you need to get more RAM\nin that server as soon as you can.\n\n466\n00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.970\nOr find out why you're running out of RAM.\n\n467\n00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:05.720\nWhy are we running out of RAM?\n\n468\n00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.110\nWell maybe we're just\nrunning a bunch of stuff.\n\n469\n00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.470\nMaybe when I specced out the server,\n\n470\n00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:13.840\nI specced it out for 1,000 users,\nand I've got 3,000 users in there.\n\n471\n00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.390\nWell, it's more than\nwhat I designed it for.\n\n472\n00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:16.940\nI'm running out of memory.\n\n473\n00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.490\nBut more often than not,\nthat's not the case.\n\n474\n00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:24.790\nThe most common scenario though is\nthat for some reason, a program runs,\n\n475\n00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:28.907\nit puts some stuff in memory and\nthen the program closes.\n\n476\n00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:33.156\nAnd when the program closes, it's supposed\nto remove that stuff from memory, but\n\n477\n00:23:33.156 --> 00:23:34.420\nwhat if it doesn't.\n\n478\n00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:39.050\nWhat if it crashes or it just doesn't\ncare and it leaves this stuff in memory.\n\n479\n00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.900\nWell, it sits there, it sits there in RAM.\n\n480\n00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.290\nIf the program runs again,\nit does it again.\n\n481\n00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:48.550\nIt adds more to memory and leaves it\nthere, and more and more and more, until,\n\n482\n00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:51.970\nover a period of time,\nwe run out of physical RAM.\n\n483\n00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.040\nWell, most of the stuff is just\nsitting there idle anyway.\n\n484\n00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.220\nSo it moves it over to the page file and\nsticks it in the page file.\n\n485\n00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.200\nWell, the page file is gonna\ngrow until it hits a maximum.\n\n486\n00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.451\nAnd then the RAM is gonna\ngrow until it hits a maximum,\n\n487\n00:24:02.451 --> 00:24:05.115\nand when they're both at their maximum,\nthe system locks up.\n\n488\n00:24:05.115 --> 00:24:05.780\nThat's what happens.\n\n489\n00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:10.062\nSystem stops responding Now it's been\ngetting increasingly slower and slower and\n\n490\n00:24:10.062 --> 00:24:11.048\nslower over time.\n\n491\n00:24:11.048 --> 00:24:13.580\nSo we usually can spot this at a time.\n\n492\n00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.210\nBut if you're one of those people that\njust goes in and reboots it, server's up.\n\n493\n00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:20.500\nWell, you don't know what caused it,\nyou weren't able to see it.\n\n494\n00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.340\nWhen you reboot the server,\nall the RAM gets erased, right?\n\n495\n00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.257\nRAM is volatile memory.\n\n496\n00:24:25.257 --> 00:24:29.710\nWhen it loses electricity for that brief\nmoment during a reboot, it gets erased.\n\n497\n00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:33.060\nSo all that dead data that was\nsitting there in RAM is now gone.\n\n498\n00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.280\nThe page file?\n\n499\n00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.320\nThe page file gets erased.\n\n500\n00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.430\nIt doesn't technically get deleted, it's\nstill sitting there on the hard drive.\n\n501\n00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.840\nBut everything in it gets marked for\noverwrite when you reboot.\n\n502\n00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.510\nSo you're starting off fresh and\nclean with all that memory again.\n\n503\n00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:46.710\nAnd the buildup starts occurring.\n\n504\n00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:48.950\nSo how do we troubleshoot\nsomething like that?\n\n505\n00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:53.140\nWell, unfortunately memory\nleaks usually take weeks,\n\n506\n00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.075\nsometimes even months, to manifest.\n\n507\n00:24:55.075 --> 00:24:58.810\nThis screen that I'm watching right here\nis showing me my memory utilization.\n\n508\n00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:02.350\nAnd as I start to do things,\nlike if I launch some utilities, you know,\n\n509\n00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:05.064\nmaybe fire up some Powershells,\nsome Google Chrome,\n\n510\n00:25:05.064 --> 00:25:08.491\nwhich I don't know why I have\nGoogle Chrome installed on the server.\n\n511\n00:25:08.491 --> 00:25:11.477\nBut if I start installing, or\nyou know, launching programs and\n\n512\n00:25:11.477 --> 00:25:14.620\ndoing stuff like that,\nthat's all gonna take memory.\n\n513\n00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.420\nAnd so I can see my memory start to climb.\n\n514\n00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.160\nRight?\n\n515\n00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:23.890\nBut now that these programs are running,\nto see them slowly consuming and\n\n516\n00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:26.660\nwasting memory, that takes a lot of work.\n\n517\n00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:30.670\nI've gotta wait as people naturally go\nthrough the business of running programs,\n\n518\n00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.120\nand closing windows, and\nopening windows, and stuff.\n\n519\n00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.910\nWe're gonna see that go up and down.\n\n520\n00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:36.610\nNow, when I close those windows,\n\n521\n00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:40.180\nsee how it climbed up when I ran\nPowershell in Internet Explorer, and\n\n522\n00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.100\nwhen I closed it, it went back down\nto the level where we expected it.\n\n523\n00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.350\nWith a memory leak, you won't see that.\n\n524\n00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:49.150\nIt'll go up, and then even if\nyou close it, it stays up, and\n\n525\n00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:50.100\nit doesn't go back down.\n\n526\n00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.500\nIt left stuff resident in memory.\n\n527\n00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.840\nBut it can take a long time to manifest,\nso normally a window like this that's\n\n528\n00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.450\nshowing me 60 seconds in the life\nof a server is not enough.\n\n529\n00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:04.130\nI need to use a performance monitor or\nsome kind of network monitoring system,\n\n530\n00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:07.165\nsomething like PRTG, MRTG.\n\n531\n00:26:07.165 --> 00:26:11.160\nNagios, Zabbix,\nSolarWinds Network Performance Monitor,\n\n532\n00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.670\nany of those guys that can\nrecord performance over time,\n\n533\n00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.090\nrecord my memory over time,\nso I can see the trend.\n\n534\n00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:20.490\nAnd I might see that, hey,\nover a three week period\n\n535\n00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:24.030\nmemory utilization continued to climb,\nclimb, climb, climb, climb.\n\n536\n00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.270\nThere's something wrong there.\n\n537\n00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:26.560\nThere's something that's not right.\n\n538\n00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.330\nAnd then before rebooting I need to\nfind out what that is cuz once I reboot\n\n539\n00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:31.480\nI lose that information.\n\n540\n00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.994\n&gt;&gt; So with a memory leak, Don, you would\nsuggest putting in some kind of trending\n\n541\n00:26:34.994 --> 00:26:37.672\nanalysis type of software there for\nyour monitoring tool?\n\n542\n00:26:37.672 --> 00:26:39.392\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nI mean you should have it anyway, right?\n\n543\n00:26:39.392 --> 00:26:42.640\nYou need trending software so\nyou know when to upgrade.\n\n544\n00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.030\nRight, if everything's working perfectly\nI need to know the trends of how I'm\n\n545\n00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:48.450\nconsuming memory and CPU and disk.\n\n546\n00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:53.460\nSo that I can say, wow, in 18 months\nthis server is not gonna be able to\n\n547\n00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:57.260\nhandle our workload if we continue\ngrowing the way we're growing right now.\n\n548\n00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.450\nSo we need to increase\nour budget next year.\n\n549\n00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:01.790\nThat's what a real IT department does.\n\n550\n00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:03.950\nYou have to trend and look to the future.\n\n551\n00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:06.980\nSure sometimes things go viral and\nexplode, and you can't plan for\n\n552\n00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.055\nthat, but normal utilization you can.\n\n553\n00:27:10.055 --> 00:27:11.535\nAnd by doing those trends,\n\n554\n00:27:11.535 --> 00:27:14.455\nyou should be able to spot the outliers\nlike when there's a memory leak.\n\n555\n00:27:14.455 --> 00:27:16.915\nNow how do you fix a memory\nleak once you find it?\n\n556\n00:27:16.915 --> 00:27:18.625\nWell, I guess, first off, finding it.\n\n557\n00:27:18.625 --> 00:27:20.425\nIf I see that I'm\nconsuming a lot of memory,\n\n558\n00:27:20.425 --> 00:27:23.645\nwe can use those same utilities\nto go in and find out why.\n\n559\n00:27:23.645 --> 00:27:25.704\nIn Windows, we have the resource monitor.\n\n560\n00:27:25.704 --> 00:27:27.093\nAnd with the resource monitor,\n\n561\n00:27:27.093 --> 00:27:30.195\nyou can take that server when you see\nit starting to get low on memory.\n\n562\n00:27:30.195 --> 00:27:33.020\nWhen it's getting to that point where you\nthink you're gonna have to reboot it.\n\n563\n00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:37.200\nAnd you can come in and pull up\nthe memory that it's consuming, and\n\n564\n00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.350\nsee who's got the most committed and\nworking memory.\n\n565\n00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.450\nAnd whoever is leaking will have the most.\n\n566\n00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:47.210\nThey'll be consuming a ton of\nthat available resources, right.\n\n567\n00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:52.110\nSo you can spot that, examine it,\nfigure it out and go from there.\n\n568\n00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:55.090\nUsually whoever was the vendor for that\nsoftware will have an update or a fix, or\n\n569\n00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.190\nyou'll have to engage with\nthem to get a fix written.\n\n570\n00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:00.930\n&gt;&gt; Don, you've shown us resource\nmonitor here in a Windows environment.\n\n571\n00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:06.270\nNow I know you work heavily, or have and\nstill do, work heavily in Linux.\n\n572\n00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.900\nDo we have some kind of utility\nthat we can also spot a memory\n\n573\n00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.050\nleak inside of Linux?\n\n574\n00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's a little more command line driven.\n\n575\n00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.427\nAnd again, I would use MRTG,\nor Nagios to monitor it,\n\n576\n00:28:16.427 --> 00:28:20.480\ncuz then you get a nice web UI\nwhere you can see everything.\n\n577\n00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.280\nBut if you don't have that,\n\n578\n00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:25.140\nif you're just straight up at a Linux\ncommand shell prompt like this.\n\n579\n00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.055\nYou can still spot what's going on.\n\n580\n00:28:27.055 --> 00:28:29.470\nYou've got utilities like free.\n\n581\n00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.070\nThe free command if you run it.\n\n582\n00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.830\nIt's on every distro that I'm aware of.\n\n583\n00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.700\nShows you how much memory you're using,\nright.\n\n584\n00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.290\nIf you do free -h,\nthat puts it in a human-readable format so\n\n585\n00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:45.770\nI can see this server has according to it,\nit's got 3.7 gigs of RAM.\n\n586\n00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.940\nAnd right now, it's got 1.3 gigs free.\n\n587\n00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:51.080\nSo I'm consuming 2.5\ngigs of RAM apparently.\n\n588\n00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:55.350\nAnd then I can see it's got another 4\ngigs of swap file that's entirely free.\n\n589\n00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:56.180\nThat's what I want.\n\n590\n00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.170\nI wanna see that,\nI love it when I see an empty swap file.\n\n591\n00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.100\nMeans I'm not swapping.\n\n592\n00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.220\nMeans I've got enough RAM to handle my\nworkload and I'm not writing down to it.\n\n593\n00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.590\nSo that's one thing that we can see.\n\n594\n00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.061\nThe problem is it's just showing\nme a single point in time.\n\n595\n00:29:08.061 --> 00:29:09.559\nI would have to sit here and run it.\n\n596\n00:29:09.559 --> 00:29:12.421\nAll right and I'll run it again and\nthen I'll run it again.\n\n597\n00:29:12.421 --> 00:29:13.583\nAnd you just keep running it and\nrunning it and\n\n598\n00:29:13.583 --> 00:29:14.630\nrunning it to see if you can spot a trend.\n\n599\n00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.280\nThat's not the most effective.\n\n600\n00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.940\nSame thing with the top command.\n\n601\n00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:22.340\nThe top command will come up and\nit will show you CPU and\n\n602\n00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:26.750\nmemory consumption as well as virtual\nmemory that's being consumed.\n\n603\n00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:31.940\nSo I can spot that and I can see\napplications that are consuming memory and\n\n604\n00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.640\nI can watch to see if they're growing and\ngrowing or\n\n605\n00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.680\nif they're consuming just huge\namounts more than they should, right?\n\n606\n00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.820\nWe can spot that.\n\n607\n00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.690\nBut it doesn't really help us for\ntrending.\n\n608\n00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:41.780\nThere's not really a great\nway to trend here.\n\n609\n00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.600\nYou could write a cron job\nthat harvested the data and\n\n610\n00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.918\nwrote it to a file every five minutes or\nevery two minutes or whatever.\n\n611\n00:29:47.918 --> 00:29:52.680\nBut having third party software to monitor\nthat is really gonna help you a lot more.\n\n612\n00:29:54.402 --> 00:29:56.380\nAll right, let's see,\nI'm running low on time.\n\n613\n00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.960\nI got a few others that I need to talk\nabout, actually I got quite a few others.\n\n614\n00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.550\nSo I think we're gonna have to go into\na part two on this one as we run through\n\n615\n00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:06.270\nsome of the more common software scenario\ntype issues that we run in to on service.\n\n616\n00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:06.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\n\n617\n00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.238\nwell you've already mentioned it, it looks\nlike that is a great place to wrap it up.\n\n618\n00:30:10.238 --> 00:30:10.875\nBut before we do,\n\n619\n00:30:10.875 --> 00:30:13.634\ndo you have any additional words that you\nmight want to throw into this one, or\n\n620\n00:30:13.634 --> 00:30:16.670\nare we gonna just leave them with\na cliffhanger and say join us in part two?\n\n621\n00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:19.020\n&gt;&gt; Well one word of advice\nis with memory leaks.\n\n622\n00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.450\nIf it's third party software,\nyou need to engage with them, right?\n\n623\n00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.560\nWhoever the author is they'll\nbe able to help diagnose it and\n\n624\n00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.680\nhopefully create a fix or a patch.\n\n625\n00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.890\nIt happens, you can have software that's\nbeen running fine for ten years and\n\n626\n00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:33.670\na little patch update comes out and\nit introduces a memory leak, it happens.\n\n627\n00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:36.840\nYou can get memory leaks on appliances,\nI've seen them on network switches.\n\n628\n00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.672\nI've had Cisco switches that had\nmemory leaks where every three weeks,\n\n629\n00:30:39.672 --> 00:30:41.630\nthey'd have to be rebooted\nuntil that was fixed.\n\n630\n00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:43.738\nSo, this type of stuff happens and\n\n631\n00:30:43.738 --> 00:30:47.747\nengaging the vendor is a great way\nto get that resolved and fixed.\n\n632\n00:30:47.747 --> 00:30:49.902\nOn your own,\nyou might be able to find the leak and\n\n633\n00:30:49.902 --> 00:30:53.162\nthen not be able to do anything about\nit except schedule a routine reboot or\n\n634\n00:30:53.162 --> 00:30:56.330\nsomething, which is not a great\nway to fix the problem.\n\n635\n00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:56.980\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don.\n\n636\n00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.110\nWell, we appreciate having\nyou here in the studio.\n\n637\n00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.720\nWe appreciate you, the viewer watching.\n\n638\n00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.830\nWe hope you've enjoyed, signing out for\nITProTV, I've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n639\n00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:05.587\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don

00:00:11.834\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:15.365\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.365 --> 00:00:16.269\nI'm you're host, Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:17.511\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:21.075\nwe are continuing through our series\nin Comptia's Server Plus SK004.\n\n8\n00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:24.495\nJoining us back in the studios for\n\n9\n00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:27.420\na part two of troubleshooting\nsoftware Is Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.210\nDon, how you doing sir?\n\n11\n00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.640\n&gt;&gt; I am doing swell, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.040\nReady to dive right back into\ntroubleshooting software.\n\n13\n00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.000\nAnd in this episode,\n\n14\n00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.940\nwe're gonna kick things off with\nthe big guy which is a stop error.\n\n15\n00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.031\nA stop error is when a server just well,\nstops.\n\n16\n00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:44.630\nIt just stops working, right.\n\n17\n00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.299\nThis could manifest a few different ways,\nbut the way\n\n18\n00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:51.287\nit normally works is in a Window server\nyou get the dreaded blue screen of death.\n\n19\n00:00:51.287 --> 00:00:54.860\nThe bsod where the whole screen goes\nblue and you get some text on there.\n\n20\n00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.753\nThat means nothing to you.\n\n21\n00:00:55.753 --> 00:00:58.428\nAnd then the server reboots right.\n\n22\n00:00:58.428 --> 00:01:02.397\nOn a Linux server you'll typically see\na seg fault or something like that where\n\n23\n00:01:02.397 --> 00:01:06.063\nthere might be some kind of error\nmessage at the bottom of the screen, but\n\n24\n00:01:06.063 --> 00:01:08.790\ntypically the screen goes black,\nand then reboots.\n\n25\n00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.665\nIf you're running an OS 10 server, it just\nreboots, you don't get a screen at all,\n\n26\n00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:15.955\nand then when it comes back up you get\na black screen with some text saying\n\n27\n00:01:15.955 --> 00:01:19.530\nby the way, the system rebooted due\nto an error, do you want to continue.\n\n28\n00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.990\nAgain, not much information.\n\n29\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.328\nThere's some similar components here\nbecause all of them are really caused\n\n30\n00:01:26.328 --> 00:01:27.083\nthe same way.\n\n31\n00:01:27.083 --> 00:01:30.911\nOccasionally we can perform\nan activity on a server that is so\n\n32\n00:01:30.911 --> 00:01:36.420\nfar beyond what the operating system\nexpected that it doesn't know what to do.\n\n33\n00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.100\nIt doesn't know how to recover and\n\n34\n00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.630\nwhen that happens its only choice is\nto shut down, to stop, to reboot.\n\n35\n00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.270\nSo most operating systems have a kernel\nmonitor that's running in the background.\n\n36\n00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.240\nRemember that,\nin your operating system what we see,\n\n37\n00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.940\nwhat we interact with is really\njust a GUI, is a user interface.\n\n38\n00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.738\nUnder the hood, there's a single small\napplication that's called a kernel.\n\n39\n00:01:59.738 --> 00:02:01.960\nAnd the kernel is what's\nactually running the show.\n\n40\n00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.289\nAnd it's small.\nIt's usually under 2 MB in size,\n\n41\n00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:05.290\nvery small.\n\n42\n00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.090\nBut its what’s really doing the work.\n\n43\n00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.920\nAnd, when the kernel doesn’t know\nwhat to do it freezes it stops right?\n\n44\n00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.682\nThey call it a kernel panic,\nwhere the kernel just freezes well,\n\n45\n00:02:18.682 --> 00:02:20.165\nit panics, right?\n\n46\n00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:23.472\nAnd if there is a monitoring\nservice running in the background,\n\n47\n00:02:23.472 --> 00:02:27.520\nthat's running even higher than\nthe kernel and it sees that.\n\n48\n00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.420\nIt can say all right,\n\n49\n00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.850\nlet me restart the kernel which\neffectively restarts the whole system.\n\n50\n00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.320\nThat's why when you get\na blue screen of death or\n\n51\n00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.890\nyou get a stop error,\nyour system becomes unresponsive.\n\n52\n00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.670\nYour keyboard doesn't work,\nyour mouse doesn't work,\n\n53\n00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.940\nyou can't interact with the system anymore\nbecause the kernel's dead in the water and\n\n54\n00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.720\nthe kernel drives everything.\n\n55\n00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.858\nAnd then the kernel reboots and the system\ncomes back up and everything runs fine.\n\n56\n00:02:47.858 --> 00:02:50.300\nAll right, now what can cause this?\n\n57\n00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.690\nThere's a few things that can\ncause a blue screen of death or\n\n58\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.410\na kernel panic, segment fault, whatever.\n\n59\n00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.230\nSometimes their names can really be very,\nvery detailed.\n\n60\n00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.230\nWhat happens is we have to perform some\nkind of action that the kernel just has no\n\n61\n00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.160\nway of tolerating a great example\nof that is a buffer overflow.\n\n62\n00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.520\nA buffer overflow is when a program\nstores a variable in memory.\n\n63\n00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.310\nIt sets aside a certain\namount of memory for it.\n\n64\n00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.840\nSo let's say I have a program and\n\n65\n00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.000\nit sets aside 16 bytes of\nmemory to store some values.\n\n66\n00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.980\nAnd then it writes 17 bytes to it.\n\n67\n00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.768\nWhat happens to the 17th byte?\n\n68\n00:03:23.768 --> 00:03:26.336\nRight, bytes one through 16, they fit.\n\n69\n00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:28.960\nByte 17, what does it do?\n\n70\n00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.430\nWell the software is supposed to recognize\nthat it's doing something bad and\n\n71\n00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.650\nit's supposed to throw out that bit.\n\n72\n00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.660\nIt's supposed to not allow it to go in.\n\n73\n00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.640\nBut sometimes software doesn't check.\n\n74\n00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.750\nAnd hackers can take advantage of that and\nthey can push in extra bytes.\n\n75\n00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.640\nAnd when that happens, one of two things\nis going to occur In a worst case\n\n76\n00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.220\nscenario, the 17th byte gets written\nover whatever's next in memory.\n\n77\n00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.150\nAnd whatever's next in memory could be\napplications running with root level or\n\n78\n00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.900\nadministrative level privileges.\n\n79\n00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.370\nAnd now you've got a remotely exploitable\nvulnerability in your server.\n\n80\n00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.360\nThat's bad, right?\n\n81\n00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.140\nOr in a more common scenario,\n\n82\n00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.760\nthat 17th bit goes to overwrite something\nit shouldn't overwrite and it goes to\n\n83\n00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.490\noverwrite something that's in use causing\nthe system to freak out and freeze.\n\n84\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.710\nThat's what we normally see\nwhen we have a buffer overflow.\n\n85\n00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.470\nThe same thing goes for most of the other\nareas out there like a segment fault\n\n86\n00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.540\nwhere we're expecting data to be there,\nwhen we go to read it and\n\n87\n00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.760\nthe data is not there we have a fault,\nand the system freezes.\n\n88\n00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.720\nIt just can't deal with it.\n\n89\n00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.550\nWell, there's a lot of errors\nthat it can deal with.\n\n90\n00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.040\nFor example, I might be in Firefox,\nand I go to some webpage and\n\n91\n00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.740\na plug in loads, and\nthe plug in has a problem, and it crashes.\n\n92\n00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.250\nWell the plug in crashes,\nFirefox crashes but my system stays up.\n\n93\n00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.060\nThe kernel stays up, right?\n\n94\n00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.710\nWhen you run applications on your system,\nyou have userland and kernelland, right?\n\n95\n00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.240\nAnd in kernelland, that's where\nthe hardcore system stuff runs.\n\n96\n00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.630\nIn userland,\nthat's stuff that you run as an end user.\n\n97\n00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.380\nAnd normally,\nwhen you crash things in user land,\n\n98\n00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.050\nit just affects you,\nthe application you're running.\n\n99\n00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.780\nIt doesn't affect the rest of the system.\n\n100\n00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.840\nBut crashes in kernel land will\nbring the whole system down.\n\n101\n00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.110\nWell most of our programs don't run in\nthe kernel space, but our drivers do.\n\n102\n00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.720\nAll of your hardware drivers\nrun in that kernel space.\n\n103\n00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.250\nThey might be loaded in user space, but\n\n104\n00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.490\nthey're being accessed\nby the kernel directly.\n\n105\n00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.367\nAnd if there's problem with a driver,\nit can lead to one of these faults.\n\n106\n00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:28.800\nYou will see like the IRQ.\n\n107\n00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.620\nThe interrupt request,\n\n108\n00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.800\nthat'll generate faults when we go\nto access hardware inappropriately.\n\n109\n00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.020\nYou can end up with things\nthat that can lead to a crash.\n\n110\n00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.790\nAlso, running out of memory or\njust any system resource really.\n\n111\n00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.690\nIf you're running out of CPU cycles\nthose can lead to environments ending up\n\n112\n00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.710\nwith one of these crashes.\n\n113\n00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.985\nMost of you have already seen these\nbefore, if you ever wanna see one.\n\n114\n00:05:46.985 --> 00:05:50.401\nIn the Windows world there's a little\nprogram Microsoft puts out called\n\n115\n00:05:50.401 --> 00:05:53.873\nNot My Fault, which is kind of a funny\nprogram because it lets you generate\n\n116\n00:05:53.873 --> 00:05:56.010\ncrashes like these that I can create.\n\n117\n00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.450\nBuffer overflows, or\nstack overflows, double freeze.\n\n118\n00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.740\nI can create all of the different types of\nerrors that could cause a system to fault.\n\n119\n00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.330\nSo for example,\n\n120\n00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.620\nif I wanted to do a high IRQL fault,\nright, this is a kernel mode fault.\n\n121\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.430\nAnd what it is, is where the kernel\ngoes to access a piece of hardware, and\n\n122\n00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.460\nit's going to use an interrupt\nrequest to reach out to that hardware.\n\n123\n00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.150\nAnd something goes wrong with\nthat interrupt request, right?\n\n124\n00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.790\nThat it's not able to contact\nthe hardware it freaks out.\n\n125\n00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:24.450\nIt doesn't know what to do.\n\n126\n00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.730\nThe kernel is supposed to be the only\nthing that can access the hardware.\n\n127\n00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.320\nSomething else is accessing it?\n\n128\n00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.690\nDoesn't make any sense.\n\n129\n00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:31.610\nIt doesn't know what to do.\n\n130\n00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.780\nThe system freaks out.\n\n131\n00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.460\nSo, if I do that,\nwhat's gonna happen to my system?\n\n132\n00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.650\nIt's gonna crush and the blue screen of\ndeath has changed a lot over the years,\n\n133\n00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.100\nit looks a little prettier now.\n\n134\n00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.620\nBut what its doing is kind of the same, I\nget driver IRQL not less or equal, right?\n\n135\n00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.970\nSo that's the error message that\nI've got and the system reboot.\n\n136\n00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.540\nBut notice how it didn't\nreboot right away?\n\n137\n00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.350\nIt's doing a system dump.\n\n138\n00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.060\nIn the Linux world you have a service\ncalled kdump, which is a kernel dump.\n\n139\n00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.810\nSame thing, it's optional.\n\n140\n00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.270\nYou can turn it off in Windows and\nyou can turn it off in Linux but\n\n141\n00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.870\nit's on by default.\n\n142\n00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.870\nAnd what happens is when\nthat fault gets generated,\n\n143\n00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.200\nwhen the system crashes like that It says,\noops, that's not what I wanted.\n\n144\n00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.230\nIt says we just had a crash,\nthis is really bad.\n\n145\n00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.938\nAnd the monitoring service, the one that's\nwatching the kernel to see if it locks up,\n\n146\n00:07:21.938 --> 00:07:24.968\nit says, hey, before I reboot,\nif I reboot right now,\n\n147\n00:07:24.968 --> 00:07:26.920\nyou'll never know what happened.\n\n148\n00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.720\nRight, we lose everything that's in RAM.\n\n149\n00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.595\nSo what we're gonna use is we're\ngonna check the part of RAM,\n\n150\n00:07:32.595 --> 00:07:36.487\nthat the kernel was last accessing, and\nwe’re going to write it to the hard drive.\n\n151\n00:07:36.487 --> 00:07:39.679\nWe’re going to write that to the hard\ndrive so that when we reboot,\n\n152\n00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:42.985\nyou’ll have a nice little kernel\ndump sitting there on the hard drive\n\n153\n00:07:42.985 --> 00:07:46.710\nthat a developer can look at, and\nfind out what happened, right?\n\n154\n00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.870\nThat’s an important\npiece of troubleshooting\n\n155\n00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.610\na blue screen of death like this.\n\n156\n00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.216\nNow, it takes a developer to interpret\nwhat's in those kernel lumps cause\n\n157\n00:07:55.216 --> 00:07:57.003\nit's really a dump of memory space.\n\n158\n00:07:57.003 --> 00:08:00.303\nSo, you've got to understand what's being\nstored in what memory addresses and\n\n159\n00:08:00.303 --> 00:08:02.630\nthere's not a lot of information\nthat a regular system,\n\n160\n00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.463\n[INAUDIBLE] can get of that It's to\nconfusing jumble of mess, right.\n\n161\n00:08:05.463 --> 00:08:08.935\nBut, to a developer they can open that\nup and they can see what the programs\n\n162\n00:08:08.935 --> 00:08:13.410\nare accessing, what they were doing, and\ntry and identify what that problem is.\n\n163\n00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.835\nNormally, for most of us,\nwe're gonna take that file and\n\n164\n00:08:15.835 --> 00:08:20.835\nwe're gonna send it in to the Red Hat\ntech support or Microsoft tech support or\n\n165\n00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:23.295\nwhoever to get them to\nlook at it on our behalf.\n\n166\n00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:25.885\nCuz especially Windows is\nall closed source anyway, so\n\n167\n00:08:25.885 --> 00:08:28.835\nit's not like we can interpret what\nthe heck the kernel was doing at any time.\n\n168\n00:08:28.835 --> 00:08:30.465\nIt's gonna be them that's able to do that.\n\n169\n00:08:31.645 --> 00:08:34.580\nBut, It does generate some\nnice little log messages too,\n\n170\n00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.510\nthat will help us to find that problem.\n\n171\n00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.150\nSee, I'm getting a message here\nsaying my PC run into a problem,\n\n172\n00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.750\ncausing it to restart.\n\n173\n00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.840\nI can view the details of that problem.\n\n174\n00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.398\nAnd now,\nI get some additional information.\n\n175\n00:08:47.398 --> 00:08:53.686\nHere's the dump that it made\nC:/Window/Minidump/021617-3375-01.dmp.\n\n176\n00:08:53.686 --> 00:08:57.646\nThat's a dump of the memory space the\nkernel was using at the time it crashed.\n\n177\n00:08:57.646 --> 00:09:02.917\nAnd then, there's an XML file with some\nadditional information, and then there's\n\n178\n00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:08.850\na full memory dump at C:\\Windows\\MEMORYDMP\nwhere it tried to get as much as it could.\n\n179\n00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.500\nNow, there's a problem there.\n\n180\n00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.710\nThe more RAM your system has,\nthe more hard drive space that takes.\n\n181\n00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.880\nAnd that memory dump might\nnot be able to complete,\n\n182\n00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.940\nso this we can't always count on.\n\n183\n00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.730\nThat's why there's two different dumps,\nthe mini dump and\n\n184\n00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.520\nthen the full size when\nit does it's best on.\n\n185\n00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.470\nAnd so then, it just gives a little\nbit of information here but\n\n186\n00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.770\nreally this doesn't help me to\nidentify the source of the problem.\n\n187\n00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.910\nThis is all just generic rambling message\nstuff that I don't think anybody's ever\n\n188\n00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:35.110\nread, but it doesn't actually\ntell me what caused the problem.\n\n189\n00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:39.430\nBut, assuming the system was at\nleast healthy enough to respond,\n\n190\n00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.300\nwe probably have some event log\nmessages in here that'll tell us.\n\n191\n00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.890\nSo, if I go to my event viewer,\nand I go into my Windows logs and\n\n192\n00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:51.600\nmy system log hopefully\nwe can look in here.\n\n193\n00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.200\nAnd spot where that problem came in.\n\n194\n00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.060\nNow, I say hopefully because we have to\nremember that the system did indeed crash.\n\n195\n00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.260\nAnd if it crashed,\n\n196\n00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.000\nit may not have even been able to\nwrite to the event log, right?\n\n197\n00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.450\nThat certainly happens.\n\n198\n00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.320\nI've got some warnings here which\nare more than likely telling me\n\n199\n00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:10.110\nthe system was restarted, unexpectedly.\n\n200\n00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.240\nActually, it's just telling me it\ncan't get to a certain folder.\n\n201\n00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.880\nSo, that's not my problem.\n\n202\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.500\nHere we go, errors.\n\n203\n00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:22.870\nAll right, we've got a QMU errors and this\none, this is our actual error right here.\n\n204\n00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.600\nIt's a bugcheck so\neveryone suckered degenerated, right?\n\n205\n00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.220\nBut, this one is telling me the computer\nis rebooted from a bugcheck.\n\n206\n00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.080\nThe bugcheck was,\nit gives me an identifier.\n\n207\n00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.800\nIt tells me where that memory dump was.\n\n208\n00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.040\nThis is the actual crash that happened.\n\n209\n00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.980\nSo, it's helping me by telling\nme what that bugcheck was.\n\n210\n00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.110\nIf I'm the developer that wrote that\nsoftware, I've got a BugCheck ID and\n\n211\n00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.220\nI can find that.\n\n212\n00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.580\nIn my case, I was running software\nwritten by somebody else, so\n\n213\n00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.160\nI still don't know what that\nbug check is necessarily.\n\n214\n00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.910\nAnd that's where these things get to\nbe a little on the challenging side\n\n215\n00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:49.670\nto troubleshoot.\n\n216\n00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:54.520\nCuz we'll get messages telling us, hey, we\nrebooted but we didn't cleanly shut down.\n\n217\n00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.620\nBut we don't necessarily know why,\nall right.\n\n218\n00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.640\nSo, check for those memory dumps.\n\n219\n00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.110\nOn a Linux system what you can\nalways do is look at the up time.\n\n220\n00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.610\nI don't know why Microsoft doesn't\nhave a comparable command to this.\n\n221\n00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:10.200\nBut, you might think that your server's\nbeen running uninterrupted for\n\n222\n00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.740\nmonths on end.\n\n223\n00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.530\nAnd you go and log in one day and\nyou do the uptime.\n\n224\n00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.610\nAnd you can see it's only been up for\none hour and 19 minutes,\n\n225\n00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.530\nyou're like, wait a minute.\n\n226\n00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.540\nThis has been running\n30 days uninterrupted.\n\n227\n00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:24.820\nNo, an hour and 19 minutes ago it\nrebooted, and you just didn't notice.\n\n228\n00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:29.010\nMaybe It had a kernel panic, it rebooted,\nand it's back online, you had no idea.\n\n229\n00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.680\nSo, checking things like that\nwill help you to know whether or\n\n230\n00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.840\nnot you've lost resources at some point.\n\n231\n00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.000\nIf you look inside the /var,\n\n232\n00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.530\nyou'll normally find your kernel\ndump buried in there, somewhere.\n\n233\n00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:42.980\nI haven't had a crash on mine,\n\n234\n00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:47.590\nso I don't have I don't think I have any\nin here, at least I hope I don't have any.\n\n235\n00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.340\nAgain, we should probably check for that\nstuff, because you might have a kernel\n\n236\n00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.930\nup sitting in there, and not even realized\nit because a crash could have occurred.\n\n237\n00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:58.720\nSo, always think about that understand,\nthat while people like to make fun of\n\n238\n00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.480\nWindows crashing a lot,\nevery operating system does it.\n\n239\n00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.700\nIt's almost always drives, so you'll\nnormally find a driver entry in the event\n\n240\n00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.280\nlog telling you about the problem, if you\nkeep your drivers updated you keep your\n\n241\n00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.870\nfirmware updated that will\nhelp to stave off this BSODs.\n\n242\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.500\nOS boot failures, when you power on your\nsystem, you push the power button and\n\n243\n00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.120\nBIOS does his job, right?\n\n244\n00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.880\nTurns control over to UEFI in most\nmodern systems, and then it looks for\n\n245\n00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.290\na boot partition to start\nthe operating system.\n\n246\n00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:32.450\nNow, ss long as we can find\nthe operating system BIOS job is done.\n\n247\n00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.250\nIf it can't find the operating system\nthen we likely have a hardware issue.\n\n248\n00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.290\nAn issue detecting a raid controller,\n\n249\n00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.490\ndetecting a hard drive, and we need to\ngo to our BIOS and figure that out.\n\n250\n00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.440\nBut, if we find the operating system\nwe start to boot it and then we crash.\n\n251\n00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.620\nWhat do you do then, right?\n\n252\n00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.480\nWell it happens,\nit happens a lot especially with updates.\n\n253\n00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.160\nSo, you get some new update, some new\nkernel version or an update happens.\n\n254\n00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.950\nAnd you go to reboot the server and\nit won't boot.\n\n255\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.720\nIt freezes during the boot.\n\n256\n00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.110\nWell, most systems have some\nway of recovering from that.\n\n257\n00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:03.780\nSo, for example this Red Hat system.\n\n258\n00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.810\nLet me just reboot the Red Hat system.\n\n259\n00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.340\nWhen I boot it up,\n\n260\n00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:13.510\nit knows that things might happen that\nwould cause it not to work, right?\n\n261\n00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:17.240\nAnd so when it boots up,\nwell it's shutting down right now.\n\n262\n00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:21.040\nWhen it boots up,\nI'm gonna get a little menu that pops up.\n\n263\n00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.620\nAnd what it's doing is it's saying okay,\nyou're running kernel 7.3 here.\n\n264\n00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.490\nThe kernel number's gonna be\ndifferent here, this screen.\n\n265\n00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:33.010\nSo, if I take a look at this,\nI'm running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3.\n\n266\n00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.168\nBut, when I installed it, I was running\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2, and\n\n267\n00:13:37.168 --> 00:13:38.688\nthe 7.3 update came out.\n\n268\n00:13:38.688 --> 00:13:44.470\nAnd then,\nmore updates have come out since then.\n\n269\n00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.638\nSo, I was running kernel 3.10.0-327.\n\n270\n00:13:46.638 --> 00:13:50.013\nWhen 7.3 came out,\nI upgraded to 3.10.0-514.\n\n271\n00:13:50.013 --> 00:13:55.487\nAnd then, at some point after that,\nthey pushed an update for 3.10.0-514.2.2,\n\n272\n00:13:55.487 --> 00:14:00.730\ncuz they didn't have enough numbers in the\nlast version, they gotta add some more.\n\n273\n00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.060\nWell, the key thing here is,\nwhat did it do?\n\n274\n00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.030\nIt added menu items for me.\n\n275\n00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.340\nIt's gonna boot off of the newest kernel.\n\n276\n00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.890\nBut, if I'm having a problem and\nit won't boot.\n\n277\n00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.940\nThere might be some bug or\nsome incompatibility with my driver or\n\n278\n00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.800\nsomething that's stopping\nthat new kernel from working.\n\n279\n00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.370\nSo, they give me a menu.\n\n280\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.420\nSo, I can just say, you know what\ngo back to the last kernel or\n\n281\n00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:26.390\nthe one before that or\nboot into rescue mode, all right.\n\n282\n00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:29.030\nOn a Windows Server,\nyou can boot it like rapidly spam\n\n283\n00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.840\nthe F8 button while it's booting,\nHit F8 over and over and over again.\n\n284\n00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.391\nAnd you can get into a menu, where you\ncan choose to boot without drivers or\n\n285\n00:14:35.391 --> 00:14:36.491\nbooting the VGA mode.\n\n286\n00:14:36.491 --> 00:14:38.728\nYou can boot from the Windows\ninstall media and get and\n\n287\n00:14:38.728 --> 00:14:39.892\nget to a recovery console.\n\n288\n00:14:39.892 --> 00:14:42.350\nLet's these different ways to\nget into this rescue mode.\n\n289\n00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:46.440\nAnd from there, your server is not\nnormally functional, cuz nothing starting.\n\n290\n00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.060\nBut, you can at least get into it and try\nundo whatever change causes this problem.\n\n291\n00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.210\nMay be you've just\ninstalled the new driver.\n\n292\n00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.280\nAnd now the system won't boot anymore.\n\n293\n00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.250\nBut, if you can at least get into Rescue\nMode, you can take that new driver out,\n\n294\n00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.130\nput the old driver back in, and\n\n295\n00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:04.230\nthen boot back up the way you were before,\nall right?\n\n296\n00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.740\nEvery distro's a little bit different,\n\n297\n00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.620\nRed Hat is great about\nadding these menu items.\n\n298\n00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.900\nThere's other distros that aren't so\ngreat about adding the menu items.\n\n299\n00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.930\nSo, you may need to do\nthis manually yourself.\n\n300\n00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.190\nBut, always make sure you understand\nyour operating system and\n\n301\n00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.930\nwhat options are available\nto be able to get in there.\n\n302\n00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.400\nAnd remember,\nyou should be backing up your servers too.\n\n303\n00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.850\nSo, if it completely fails to boot and\n\n304\n00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.770\nyou can't figure out why,\nIf you've got a full back up,\n\n305\n00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.390\nyou can just restore the last good back\nup and you'll be in business, right?\n\n306\n00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:34.330\nBut, if you don't have a back up,\nnow you gotta fix this problem.\n\n307\n00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.720\nAnd having rescue menus like\nthese really can help with that.\n\n308\n00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:42.060\nIt's also another reason why it's a good\nidea to keep a bootable USB key handy.\n\n309\n00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.340\nBecause I might not be able to\nboot Windows or Red Hat, but\n\n310\n00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:49.730\nif I can pop a live CD or a USB key in\nthere and boot off of that, I can at least\n\n311\n00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.230\naccess the hard drives, to be able to get\nin there and try and fix the problem.\n\n312\n00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:58.104\nIt gives you some level of access.\n\n313\n00:15:58.104 --> 00:15:59.887\nWell, I guess I kinda already\ntalked about driver issues.\n\n314\n00:15:59.887 --> 00:16:01.234\nDriver issues is the next one.\n\n315\n00:16:01.234 --> 00:16:04.839\nI'll tell you guys, when it comes to\nservers, Unless you're developing software\n\n316\n00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:08.860\nin-house, driver issues are normally your\nbig software problem that you run into.\n\n317\n00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.710\nThat drivers, people don't update them.\n\n318\n00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.020\nPeople really neglect\nupdating your drivers.\n\n319\n00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.384\nThey'll run Windows update, or\nthey'll have a Red Hat box, or\n\n320\n00:16:17.384 --> 00:16:21.807\nthey'll do a cron job to do a Yum date or\nwhatever and keep the systems up-to-date,\n\n321\n00:16:21.807 --> 00:16:23.512\nas far as the systems software.\n\n322\n00:16:23.512 --> 00:16:27.550\nBut on the driver side, those don't\nget automatically updated, do they?\n\n323\n00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.750\nWell sometimes in the Windows world.\n\n324\n00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:29.880\nThat's usually more\ntrouble than it's worth.\n\n325\n00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:35.625\nWhen you buy servers, if you're buying\nservers from Dell, or Lenovo, or\n\n326\n00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:38.110\nHPE, they have management software.\n\n327\n00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.110\nHPE has Insight Manager.\n\n328\n00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.825\nAnd with Insight Manager,\nyou can fire that up and\n\n329\n00:16:42.825 --> 00:16:44.200\nit'll monitor all of your servers.\n\n330\n00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.290\nAnd anytime there's new driver updates,\nit'll tell you, you'll get notifications.\n\n331\n00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.366\nIt's great software,\nif you take the time to set it up.\n\n332\n00:16:49.366 --> 00:16:52.940\nIt's free, you buy the server,\nyou install the software.\n\n333\n00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.970\nYou just need to have somewhere to run it.\n\n334\n00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:59.660\nDell has a similar one whose name is\ncompletely escaping me right now.\n\n335\n00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.535\nPower something cuz that's\nwhat Dell calls everything.\n\n336\n00:17:01.535 --> 00:17:05.440\n[LAUGH] So they've got essential\nmanagement software package like that.\n\n337\n00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:10.720\nIn the Linux world,\nthey support that alongside Windows.\n\n338\n00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.110\nSo they scan and they detect for\nthat, so usually fine.\n\n339\n00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:16.290\nWhen you start talking about\nunsupported OSs though,\n\n340\n00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.060\nthat's when they're not able to scan and\ncheck.\n\n341\n00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.480\nAnd so it's up to you to go out and\n\n342\n00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.480\nmake sure that you're always\nrunning the latest drivers and\n\n343\n00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.470\ndoing the latest firmware updates to\nmake sure you don't have those issues.\n\n344\n00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.130\nBut just be prepared to roll back drivers.\n\n345\n00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.240\nI always save the old drivers,\n\n346\n00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.890\nbecause you never know when\nyou might need the old driver.\n\n347\n00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.800\nMost of us, you get a new driver,\nyou just immediately delete the old one.\n\n348\n00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.490\nKeep it handy, cuz if something\nhappens where you can't boot you'll\n\n349\n00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.189\nreally wish you had that old driver\nthat you knew was able to be booted.\n\n350\n00:17:43.361 --> 00:17:44.780\nRunaway processes.\n\n351\n00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.350\nI talked about runaway\nprocesses in another episode,\n\n352\n00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:53.350\nbut just to highlight it here, a runaway\nprocess is very similar to a memory leak.\n\n353\n00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:58.430\nIn a memory leak, we have a program that\nis slowly consuming more and more memory.\n\n354\n00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:01.550\nWell a runaway process does the same\nthing, but with CPU, right?\n\n355\n00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:05.150\nIt really spirals out of control and\nconsumes CPU.\n\n356\n00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:10.040\nBe careful with this, because a lot of\npeople misidentify a runaway process.\n\n357\n00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.545\nFor example, most database software and\n\n358\n00:18:13.545 --> 00:18:19.565\nall video encoding software will take\nas much CPU as it can get, right?\n\n359\n00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:21.765\nVideo encoding is a very\ndifficult process,\n\n360\n00:18:21.765 --> 00:18:26.425\na very mathematically intensive,\nentirely CPU-based process.\n\n361\n00:18:26.425 --> 00:18:31.855\nSo if it takes 80% of the CPU,\nit's gonna get done at a certain time.\n\n362\n00:18:31.855 --> 00:18:36.240\nIf it takes 100% of the CPU,\nit's gonna get done that much faster.\n\n363\n00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.300\nAnd it doesn't matter if you've got\nthe best processors in the world,\n\n364\n00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.850\nit's gonna run about 100%, because it\nwants to get done as quick as possible.\n\n365\n00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:47.880\nSo if you're doing video encoding,\nyou fully expect to see your CPUs at 100%.\n\n366\n00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.190\nThat's how that works, right?\n\n367\n00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.019\nThat's what you want, you're getting\nthe fastest encoding done possible.\n\n368\n00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.526\nBut, if I'm running an email server,\n\n369\n00:18:55.526 --> 00:18:58.903\nI don't expect my email\nserver to be at 100% CPU.\n\n370\n00:18:58.903 --> 00:19:02.010\nIt's gonna have some disk IO as it\nqueries the mail databases and stuff.\n\n371\n00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.080\nIt's gonna have some network bandwidth\nas it's shifting email back and forth.\n\n372\n00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:10.154\nBut, the CPU should be pretty\nlow-level on that, right?\n\n373\n00:19:10.154 --> 00:19:11.840\nAnd that's how most servers are, right?\n\n374\n00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:17.010\nWhen we take a server, and\nwe jump in and start to look at it\n\n375\n00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:21.250\nwe don't expect it to be running at any\nkind of huge amount of utilization.\n\n376\n00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:23.280\nIf I take this server and\n\n377\n00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:28.460\npull up its CPU utilization,\nwhich I will get to eventually.\n\n378\n00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.530\nHere we go.\n\n379\n00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.878\nIt's kind of flatlining at 2%, 1%.\n\n380\n00:19:31.878 --> 00:19:33.520\nIt's not really doing anything.\n\n381\n00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.890\nThat's what you expect to see.\n\n382\n00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.900\nEven on a mail server,\nthat might be a very busy mail server.\n\n383\n00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.480\nIt's not taxing it mentally as\nfar as the CPU is concerned.\n\n384\n00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.160\nIt's hitting disk and\nnetwork, maybe RAM, right?\n\n385\n00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.620\nThat's what it's getting hit on.\n\n386\n00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.690\nSo if I see my CPU running at 100% and\n\n387\n00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:49.520\nI don't know why,\nnow the system might be really slow.\n\n388\n00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.660\nIt might even be unresponsive.\n\n389\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.890\nI might not be able to remote into it.\n\n390\n00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.810\nAnd I have to get up and\nwalk into the server room, so now I'm mad.\n\n391\n00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:57.710\nAnd then I got to access the console and\n\n392\n00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:02.460\njust logging in takes forever\nbecause the CPU's at 100%.\n\n393\n00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.350\nWhat happens is sometimes\na program will try and\n\n394\n00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.395\nperform an action and\nthe action will fail.\n\n395\n00:20:07.395 --> 00:20:10.150\nAnd then it'll just retry.\n\n396\n00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.920\nAnd if it has no stopping point to it,\nit just continues to retry over and\n\n397\n00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.840\nover and over again.\n\n398\n00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.860\nAnd it tries to go as fast as it can.\n\n399\n00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.680\nIt starts consuming more and\nmore resources.\n\n400\n00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.610\nAnd it can spike that CPU to 100% and\nhold it there.\n\n401\n00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.680\nWell, it's usually pretty\neast to spot those things.\n\n402\n00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.840\nYou can go into your\nTask Manager in Windows, or\n\n403\n00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:31.260\nyou can use the top command in Linux, and\nyou can see who's consuming the most CPU.\n\n404\n00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.500\nAnd whoever's really cranking it,\nyou can end that process.\n\n405\n00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.160\nYou can kill the process.\n\n406\n00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.380\nAnd when you do that,\nnow it's gonna free up those resources and\n\n407\n00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.120\nyou can get in there and correct that.\n\n408\n00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:47.290\nSo looking here, my number one\nprocess is the system idle process.\n\n409\n00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:48.920\nWell, that's not a real process.\n\n410\n00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.500\nThat means the system not doing anything\nso 99% of my CPU is doing nothing.\n\n411\n00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.840\nThat's a good thing.\n\n412\n00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.290\nBut if it said Internet Explorer was 99%,\nthat's a bad thing and I could come in and\n\n413\n00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:02.490\nkill that just by right-clicking on it and\nending that task, okay.\n\n414\n00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.561\nIn the Linux world it's very similar,\n\n415\n00:21:04.561 --> 00:21:07.057\nwell had I booted by my\nsystem I would show you.\n\n416\n00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:12.000\n[LAUGH] In the Linux world, you can use\nthe top command that I mentioned earlier,\n\n417\n00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.020\nand see who's consuming\nthe most resources.\n\n418\n00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.950\nAnd then you can use the kill\ncommand to fix that.\n\n419\n00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:17.704\nOr actually you know what?\n\n420\n00:21:17.704 --> 00:21:21.690\nI'm on a Mac, Mac is basically\nUnix just like anything else.\n\n421\n00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:23.560\nSo I can jump in here, and\n\n422\n00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.920\nI can use the top command to figure out\nwho's consuming the most CPU, right?\n\n423\n00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.960\nSo right now that top\ncommand itself is killing it.\n\n424\n00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.762\nBut I can find out that process ID, 30133.\n\n425\n00:21:34.762 --> 00:21:37.580\nAnd there's a keyboard shortcut where\nI could kill it from right here.\n\n426\n00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:43.210\nOr I could just say kill 30133 and\nit's gonna kill that process.\n\n427\n00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:45.490\nWhich, I just closed top,\nso I don't have anymore.\n\n428\n00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:49.520\nBut maybe I do something\nlike multiple tabs, right?\n\n429\n00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:56.445\nSo on this tab I'm gonna run top and\nit's 30144 now, yeah 30144.\n\n430\n00:21:56.445 --> 00:21:58.850\nAnd so it's running,\nit's consuming some CPU.\n\n431\n00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.549\nI can jump over here and say kill 30144.\n\n432\n00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:04.678\nActually I probably need to sudo that.\n\n433\n00:22:04.678 --> 00:22:07.470\nWhoops, and type in a real password.\n\n434\n00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.740\nThere we go.\nNow when I go over to this other tab I can\n\n435\n00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.420\nsee the top is exit, right?\n\n436\n00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.800\nWe've killed it off, and so\nnow we've freed up that CPU cycles.\n\n437\n00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.040\nNow, did we fix the problem?\n\n438\n00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:17.590\nNo.\n\n439\n00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.750\nWe fixed the symptom.\n\n440\n00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.210\nThe symptom was 100% CPU utilization.\n\n441\n00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:25.130\nNow we need to find out why did\nthe program do that in the first place?\n\n442\n00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.520\nAnd unfortunately you're not normally\ngonna find a lot in the logs.\n\n443\n00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.180\nMost developers don't say,\n\n444\n00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.870\nwell let's create error messages\nin case we use too much CPU.\n\n445\n00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.780\nThey just don't do that, so\n\n446\n00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.860\nwhat ends up happening is we have to\nre-run the software and watch it.\n\n447\n00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.950\nAnd say okay, what activity are we\nperforming at the time that\n\n448\n00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.950\nit then ramps up to 100% CPU and\nstays there?\n\n449\n00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:47.880\nAnd more importantly,\nwhat is is accessing?\n\n450\n00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.900\nIn Windows the Resource Monitor\nis really handy for that.\n\n451\n00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:56.930\nThe Resource Monitor will let me jump\nin and see what a program is accessing.\n\n452\n00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:01.560\nSo for example if I fire up Internet\nExplorer and it starts going crazy, right?\n\n453\n00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.110\nSo maybe I go to Google's web page.\n\n454\n00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.930\nAnd IE starts consuming 100% of the CPU.\n\n455\n00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.410\nI can go into the Resource Monitor.\n\n456\n00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:16.730\nAnd when I pull that up, I can come in and\nI can find Internet Explorer in my list.\n\n457\n00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:18.826\nWhich will be in here somewhere.\n\n458\n00:23:20.871 --> 00:23:24.415\nI say it'll be in here somewhere,\nI'm not seeing it but I will find it.\n\n459\n00:23:24.415 --> 00:23:25.960\n[LAUGH] You can't hide from me.\n\n460\n00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.490\nThere it is, iexplorer.\n\n461\n00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:31.730\nI can find it, and\nI can check it off to view it.\n\n462\n00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:36.040\nAnd once I'm viewing it, I can come in and\n\n463\n00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.080\nI can look at what on\ndisk is it accessing?\n\n464\n00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.780\nWhat storage is that resource accessing?\n\n465\n00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.360\nAnd I can find that activity\nthat it's generating.\n\n466\n00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.080\nMaybe it's locked up waiting\non access to some file.\n\n467\n00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.300\nIn my case it's actually just kinda\nsitting here doing not much of anything,\n\n468\n00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.580\njust accessing a couple\nsimple files there.\n\n469\n00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.773\nAnd I can see what memory it's consuming,\nand at what CPU.\n\n470\n00:23:55.773 --> 00:24:00.274\nI can see things based on what it's\nactually doing at the time and try and\n\n471\n00:24:00.274 --> 00:24:01.109\nisolate it.\n\n472\n00:24:01.109 --> 00:24:05.535\nMaybe it's trying to access a disk,\nand the disk is on a RAID 5 array.\n\n473\n00:24:05.535 --> 00:24:07.377\nAnd one of the disks has failed.\n\n474\n00:24:07.377 --> 00:24:10.087\nAnd so\nperformance on the array has dropped,\n\n475\n00:24:10.087 --> 00:24:14.210\ncausing me to have to constantly\nwait on that disk to do actions.\n\n476\n00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.463\nAnd so my CPU is ramping up, cuz it's\nconstantly retrying, maybe that's it.\n\n477\n00:24:17.463 --> 00:24:20.702\nUsually they just idle out while they\nwait, that may not be happening, so\n\n478\n00:24:20.702 --> 00:24:22.702\nwe can sort of see that\nwith tools like these.\n\n479\n00:24:24.617 --> 00:24:27.770\nAll right, so let's see,\nwe've got quite a few cannot mount drive.\n\n480\n00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:32.010\nCannot mount drive is a funny one, because\n\n481\n00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:36.160\nin most operating systems these days,\ndrives do what's called automounting.\n\n482\n00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:41.190\nIn other words, if I take a USB drive or a\nexternal drive of some sort, and I attach\n\n483\n00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:45.840\nit to a server, it's gonna automatically\nmount it and make it available.\n\n484\n00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.040\nBut if I can't mount it for\nsome reason, why is that?\n\n485\n00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.050\nWell, usually it’s gonna\nindicate disk corruption, right?\n\n486\n00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:53.880\nThat I’ve got a disk that for\none reason or\n\n487\n00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.630\nanother is just not able\nto be worked with anymore.\n\n488\n00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:00.220\nAnd so when that happens,\n\n489\n00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.574\nwe need to leverage some of the different\ntools that we have available.\n\n490\n00:25:03.574 --> 00:25:05.400\nAnd one of those, like in Windows,\n\n491\n00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:10.060\nis we can go into our Computer Management\nscreen and go into Disk Management.\n\n492\n00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.370\nAnd we can take a look at the disks.\n\n493\n00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:16.600\nNow, hopefully, the disks will\nshow up as being online disks.\n\n494\n00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.250\nIf they say offline,\nsee how this one says online right there?\n\n495\n00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:22.120\nIf it said offline, that would let\nme know there was some kind of\n\n496\n00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.840\nproblem where I'm not touching the disk.\n\n497\n00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.490\nYou'll see that with SAN disks a lot,\nwhere they show as offline by default.\n\n498\n00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.858\nAnd you can right-click and\nthen choose to bring it online.\n\n499\n00:25:30.858 --> 00:25:34.050\nMine is already online,\nso I see Offline instead.\n\n500\n00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:38.050\nAnd if you go to bring it online and it\nfails, now you can go to your Event Viewer\n\n501\n00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:40.970\nand look for\nthe log messages as to why it failed.\n\n502\n00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.084\nIf the drive is showing up, though,\nlike mine, it's showing up,\n\n503\n00:25:44.084 --> 00:25:46.063\nand maybe it doesn't have a drive letter.\n\n504\n00:25:46.063 --> 00:25:50.030\nWhen that happens, well, if it doesn't\nhave a drive letter, you can try and\n\n505\n00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:51.200\nmanually assign one.\n\n506\n00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.099\nSo you've got that\nChange Drive Letters and Paths.\n\n507\n00:25:53.099 --> 00:25:57.640\nBut if you still get an error,\nit's possible that there is disk damage.\n\n508\n00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.810\nNow, there's physical damage and\nlogical damage.\n\n509\n00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.410\nIf it's logical damage, we can correct it.\n\n510\n00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:05.450\nIf it's physical damage,\nyou can't correct it, can you?\n\n511\n00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:06.980\nAll you can do is work around it.\n\n512\n00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:10.780\nYou ever run one of those disk checkers,\nwhere it scans the disk looking for\n\n513\n00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.664\nerrors, and then it fixes an error?\n\n514\n00:26:12.664 --> 00:26:13.410\nWhat does it do?\n\n515\n00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:18.930\nWell, what it's doing is it finds an error\nand it reads that sector like 20 times.\n\n516\n00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:20.550\nAnd it reads it 20 times, and it says,\n\n517\n00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:25.080\nokay, out of all 20 times, 15 of the times\nit looked like there was a one there,\n\n518\n00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.510\nand 5 times it looked like\nthere was a zero there.\n\n519\n00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:31.130\nSo more often it looked like a one,\nI'm gonna assume there was a one there.\n\n520\n00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:33.714\nAnd I'm gonna put that in\na different sector, somewhere, and\n\n521\n00:26:33.714 --> 00:26:37.500\nthen I'm gonna take this sector and\nmark it as bad, so I don't use it again.\n\n522\n00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.513\nIt doesn't fix the error, it just puts\na little rope around it that says,\n\n523\n00:26:41.513 --> 00:26:42.950\ndon't go there, right?\n\n524\n00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.099\nImagine if there was\na pothole on the road, and\n\n525\n00:26:45.099 --> 00:26:47.520\nyou'd just stick an orange\ncone on the pothole.\n\n526\n00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.030\nThat didn't fix the problem, it just\ngets people drive around it, right?\n\n527\n00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.920\nThat's what a hard drive sector\nrepair does, or when you scan a disk.\n\n528\n00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.610\nJust telling people to walk around,\nit's not a long-term solution.\n\n529\n00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.535\nAnd when you have one failure,\nit's gonna lead to two, to three, to four.\n\n530\n00:27:00.535 --> 00:27:03.255\nHard drives don't get better, they don't\nself-heal, they just get worse, and\n\n531\n00:27:03.255 --> 00:27:03.890\nworse, and worse.\n\n532\n00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.207\nSo the moment you find one\nphysical error on a disk,\n\n533\n00:27:07.207 --> 00:27:10.228\nit needs to be replaced immediately,\nright?\n\n534\n00:27:10.228 --> 00:27:14.892\nThat's the rule, and everybody, Dell,\nHP, Lenovo, all of them, one error,\n\n535\n00:27:14.892 --> 00:27:16.447\nthey'll replace it.\n\n536\n00:27:16.447 --> 00:27:17.557\nThat's it, right?\n\n537\n00:27:17.557 --> 00:27:20.527\nEven if you get a SMART error, and\nthe physical test passes just fine,\n\n538\n00:27:20.527 --> 00:27:21.387\nthey'll still replace it.\n\n539\n00:27:21.387 --> 00:27:24.287\nLike, they don't mess around\nwith that on server hard drives.\n\n540\n00:27:24.287 --> 00:27:30.920\nBut if it's a logical error, maybe I have\na file that just wasn't properly deleted.\n\n541\n00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:35.790\nOr I was halfway writing to a file when\nthe system rebooted or lost power, right?\n\n542\n00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.910\nThat's not a physical error,\nit's just a logical one, and for\n\n543\n00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:40.170\nthose we can run disk checks.\n\n544\n00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.106\nIn Windows, you can pull up\nthe properties of any partition.\n\n545\n00:27:43.106 --> 00:27:47.160\nAnd you can go to Tools, and\nyou've got Error checking.\n\n546\n00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.610\nAnd you can check that disk,\nand it'll look for errors, and\n\n547\n00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:51.220\ntry and find them, right?\n\n548\n00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:55.380\nAnd if it finds them,\nit will fix them, in theory, right?\n\n549\n00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:59.640\nIn the Linux world, you have a number of\ncommand-line utilities that you can use,\n\n550\n00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.280\nthat will let you reach in there\nto scan the disks and check them.\n\n551\n00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.268\nSo if you try and mount a disk and\nyou get a failure, you can use,\n\n552\n00:28:07.268 --> 00:28:09.085\nthe most common one is fsck.\n\n553\n00:28:09.085 --> 00:28:12.870\nAnd with fsck,\nlet me get into a prompt here.\n\n554\n00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:19.097\nWith fsck, it'll let you scan an ext2,\n3, or 4 file system and look for\n\n555\n00:28:19.097 --> 00:28:21.710\nerrors, and correct them.\n\n556\n00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:23.130\nBut what if you have more\nthan one file system?\n\n557\n00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:27.180\nYou might have some that are ext,\nor something or btrfs, and so on.\n\n558\n00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:32.475\nThe easiest way to scan those and\nfix them is, if you take a look at your\n\n559\n00:28:32.475 --> 00:28:38.150\n/etc/fstab, your file system table, right?\n\n560\n00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:41.750\nThis one right here has a list of\nall the file systems that are being\n\n561\n00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:42.420\nmounted at boot time.\n\n562\n00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.825\nAnd if one of them is failing to boot,\nwhat you can do is,\n\n563\n00:28:45.825 --> 00:28:47.425\nway over here on the side.\n\n564\n00:28:47.425 --> 00:28:51.820\nLet me make this window a little bit\nbigger and rerun that, there we go.\n\n565\n00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:56.306\nWay over here on the side,\nsee this 0 0 right here, right?\n\n566\n00:28:56.306 --> 00:28:59.620\nThose 0s, they mean two different things.\n\n567\n00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.220\nOne means whether we should back up\nthe disk the next time we do a backup.\n\n568\n00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:05.260\nAnd the other one means whether we\nshould run a file system check.\n\n569\n00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:09.400\nAnd you can change that first 0 to a 1,\nand the next time you reboot,\n\n570\n00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.710\nit'll run a file system check on it.\n\n571\n00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.000\nAnd it'll run the appropriate one for\nthat file system, so\n\n572\n00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.780\nif you wanna do it at boot time,\nyou can do that.\n\n573\n00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.530\nThat's important if you've got\na file system that's always in use,\n\n574\n00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:20.930\nlike the root, it's kind of always in use.\n\n575\n00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:25.430\nSo that'll make it check it during the\nboot to make sure that it's okay, right?\n\n576\n00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.980\nOr you can just use your\nfile system checks.\n\n577\n00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:32.520\nJust remember that there are more\nthan one file system check in place.\n\n578\n00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.411\nSo you might have.\n\n579\n00:29:35.411 --> 00:29:37.551\nLet's see if I can find.\n\n580\n00:29:39.438 --> 00:29:42.100\nIt's in a different folder.\n\n581\n00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.960\nRed Hat started moving things\naround in Red Hat 7, and so\n\n582\n00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.030\nI've kind of lost where some of these are.\n\n583\n00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:51.120\nBut you'll have other utilities that are\nin the file system that are available for\n\n584\n00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.250\nthis purpose, for\nscanning your disk and looking at it.\n\n585\n00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:55.820\nAnd there's plenty of third-party\nsystems that are out there too,\n\n586\n00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:56.820\nthat help with that.\n\n587\n00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.160\nBut if we look at, like, xfs, right?\n\n588\n00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.660\nSo xfs has xfs_repair.\n\n589\n00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.190\nVersus fsck for the ext systems,\nthis one's for xfs.\n\n590\n00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:07.820\nSo you can get in there and use those,\nwhichever one's appropriate for\n\n591\n00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.680\nyour file system, to try and repair it.\n\n592\n00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.330\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\n\n593\n00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.630\nnow it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n594\n00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.270\nBut I'm looking at our list, and I know\nthat we've still got a lot more that\n\n595\n00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.510\nyou're gonna discuss when it comes\nto troubleshooting software.\n\n596\n00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:20.200\nBut it does look like we're\ngonna go into our Part 3.\n\n597\n00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.600\nHowever, before we do that,\ndo you have any parting words for\n\n598\n00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.630\nwhat we've talked about in this episode?\n\n599\n00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.224\n&gt;&gt; Well, hopefully you don't have\nto deal with any of this, right?\n\n600\n00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:28.908\nBut every one of these scenarios that\nI've been telling you guys about,\n\n601\n00:30:28.908 --> 00:30:29.656\nthey're all real,\n\n602\n00:30:29.656 --> 00:30:32.486\nthey're all ones that I've encountered\nin real-life land far too often.\n\n603\n00:30:32.486 --> 00:30:35.404\nSo just be ready and understand\nthat if you just take your time,\n\n604\n00:30:35.404 --> 00:30:38.047\nlook at all the symptoms, and\nthe clues, and the hints,\n\n605\n00:30:38.047 --> 00:30:40.560\nyou'll be able to locate\nwhat the issue is.\n\n606\n00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.670\nThat usually it's fixing the problem,\nit's the hard part.\n\n607\n00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.650\nIf you have to get\na third-party vendor involved,\n\n608\n00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:46.470\nit can take a while to get\nthings fixed sometimes.\n\n609\n00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.934\nSo oftentimes, doing that\nreboot-to-fix isn’t such a bad idea,\n\n610\n00:30:49.934 --> 00:30:53.270\njust to get you by until\na permanent fix can get put in.\n\n611\n00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:56.720\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, well, we appreciate\nhaving you here in the studios with us.\n\n612\n00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.680\nAnd we appreciate you,\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n613\n00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.480\nSigning out for ITPRO.TV,\nI’ve been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n614\n00:31:01.480 -->

00:00:08.206\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.206 --> 00:00:11.844\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:14.950\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.203\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode\n\n7\n00:00:18.203 --> 00:00:23.030\nwe are continuing through our\nseries in CompTIA Server+ SK0-004.\n\n8\n00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.820\nJoining us back in the studios again\nis none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.120\nDon, how are we doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.637\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing swell, Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:27.637 --> 00:00:31.940\nReady to dive right back in and continue\ntroubleshooting software on our servers,\n\n12\n00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.040\nwhich is a full time job for most people.\n\n13\n00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.725\nWe're gonna be kicking things off with\na couple of different topics here.\n\n14\n00:00:36.725 --> 00:00:40.335\nThe one I wanna launch with is,\ncannot write to the system log.\n\n15\n00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:44.604\nSo I've mentioned the system log\nin part one and in part two.\n\n16\n00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:50.045\nAnd I mentioned that was the first thing\nI go to when I troubleshoot a server.\n\n17\n00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:53.935\nWhat happens if your system can't\nwrite to the system log, though?\n\n18\n00:00:53.935 --> 00:00:55.870\nAnd it does happen, it does happen.\n\n19\n00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.152\nIt's a super pain, first off,\ncuz you can't write to the system log.\n\n20\n00:00:59.152 --> 00:01:02.123\nSo how are you supposed to add new\nevents to it if you don't have any\n\n21\n00:01:02.123 --> 00:01:03.500\nmore room to write?\n\n22\n00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.030\nYou'll really get into some trouble.\n\n23\n00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.465\nOkay, well, this can be caused\nthrough two different sides.\n\n24\n00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:12.020\nOne side is an actual error,\na problem that you need to correct.\n\n25\n00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.790\nAnd the other side is a mistake that\nyou made by configuring things wrong.\n\n26\n00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.510\nSo either way, it is a problem.\n\n27\n00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.540\nLet's start with the mistake\nthat we can make.\n\n28\n00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.590\nSystem logs grow, they get log messages.\n\n29\n00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.150\nThey get bigger and\nbigger and bigger over time.\n\n30\n00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.993\nAnd as they get bigger, eventually\nthey can fill up the hard drive.\n\n31\n00:01:26.993 --> 00:01:30.832\nAnd if your hard drive runs out of space,\ncan you write anymore to it?\n\n32\n00:01:30.832 --> 00:01:33.180\nNo, you can't, right?\n\n33\n00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.020\nEven on a gigantic hard drive, you can\nstill have where the log file grows to\n\n34\n00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.290\nsuch a size it exceeds the maximum\nfile size for your file system.\n\n35\n00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.490\nRemember that NTFS and EXT4 and XFS,\nthey all have a maximum file size.\n\n36\n00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.540\nOne file can only grow to a certain size.\n\n37\n00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.030\nAnd if your log file exceeds that,\nyou can't write any more messages, right?\n\n38\n00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.860\nThose are things that can\nlead to this type of problem.\n\n39\n00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.283\nYou run out of space and\nyou got a problem.\n\n40\n00:02:00.283 --> 00:02:01.880\nSo how do we get around that?\n\n41\n00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.240\nWell, there's two technologies\nthat we need to leverage here.\n\n42\n00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.341\nThe first one is log rotation.\n\n43\n00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:10.757\nLog rotation is where we say,\nall right, at the end of each day, or\n\n44\n00:02:10.757 --> 00:02:14.661\nat the end of each week I take the log,\nand I split it off into a separate file,\n\n45\n00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:18.710\nand I compress it or just let it sit\nthere or move it somewhere else.\n\n46\n00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.660\nAnd then I create an all-new\nempty log file for the next day.\n\n47\n00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.140\nBy doing that,\nit's breaking up the log file into pieces.\n\n48\n00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.820\nNow you won't exceed your\nmaximum file size, but\n\n49\n00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.830\nyou could still fill up the hard drive.\n\n50\n00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.960\nAnd that's where we need\nto engage log overwrite.\n\n51\n00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.290\nThat it's nice to have a history of logs.\n\n52\n00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.770\nBut you don't necessarily need a year's\nworth of event log messages for\n\n53\n00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.620\na server, right?\n\n54\n00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.590\nSo we might want to overwrite older\nevents to make room for newer events.\n\n55\n00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.700\nAnd you can do that.\n\n56\n00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.243\nIt's called,\nwell there's a few different names.\n\n57\n00:02:48.243 --> 00:02:49.909\nYou hear people call it circular logging,\n\n58\n00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.780\nwhere you're overwriting old\nstuff to make room for new stuff.\n\n59\n00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.640\nOr just phasing out the old records.\n\n60\n00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.800\nIt's a good system unless you do\nneed log messages from a year ago.\n\n61\n00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.190\nWhat if I need that?\n\n62\n00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.970\nWell, in that scenario you need\nto leverage a syslog server or\n\n63\n00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.100\na remote logging server.\n\n64\n00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.864\nSo that your log messages are getting\ndumped into a database somewhere, and\n\n65\n00:03:07.864 --> 00:03:09.243\nthat way you can flush out the server,\n\n66\n00:03:09.243 --> 00:03:11.770\nbut know that you have still access\nto those records somewhere else.\n\n67\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.585\nDatabase servers can grow really huge.\n\n68\n00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:18.075\nMessage logs aren't designed\nto grow that huge, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:18.075 --> 00:03:20.205\nSo that's the number one thing\nis that we need to verify, and\n\n70\n00:03:20.205 --> 00:03:21.555\nnow most of our systems\nare already doing that.\n\n71\n00:03:21.555 --> 00:03:25.946\nSo for example on this Linux system,\nif I take a look at /var/log and\n\n72\n00:03:25.946 --> 00:03:28.975\npoke around in there,\nI can find messages, but\n\n73\n00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:34.228\nthen I've also got these other messages\nfiles here where it's rotated the logs.\n\n74\n00:03:34.228 --> 00:03:38.327\nAt the end of that day it split\nit off into its own log file and\n\n75\n00:03:38.327 --> 00:03:39.592\nit kept it there.\n\n76\n00:03:39.592 --> 00:03:46.910\nAnd if we look around inside of our\n/etc folder, we'll find logrotate.conf.\n\n77\n00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.630\nAnd if you look at it,\nit's defining in here how to rotate.\n\n78\n00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.942\nAnd it's set right now to rotate on a,\nwhoops, what is going on?\n\n79\n00:03:58.942 --> 00:04:00.680\nApparently it doesn't\nwant to let me scroll.\n\n80\n00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.190\nThere, so it's set to rotate weekly, so\n\n81\n00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.320\nonce a week it's gonna\ngenerate a new file.\n\n82\n00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.380\nIt's only gonna keep four\nweeks' worth of logs.\n\n83\n00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.560\nSo when something's five\nweeks old it deletes it.\n\n84\n00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.240\nIt makes room.\n\n85\n00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.990\nAnd I can come in and\nedit this and change it and\n\n86\n00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.200\nmanipulate it to meet\nthe needs that I want.\n\n87\n00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.850\nMost Linux distros would\ngive you that functionality.\n\n88\n00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.850\nWindows is the same way.\n\n89\n00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.420\nIn the Windows environment you\nhave your event viewer, right?\n\n90\n00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.510\nAnd in the event viewer you can pull\nup the properties of any of your logs.\n\n91\n00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.250\nSo I can come in here and\ntake my system log.\n\n92\n00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.080\nAnd I can jump into it and take a look\nat what happens when it gets full.\n\n93\n00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.450\nNow Microsoft doesn't like to break\ntheirs up into multiple files.\n\n94\n00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.470\nThey keep it in a little database already.\n\n95\n00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.210\nBut I can still set a maximum log size and\nwhat to do when it's full.\n\n96\n00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.700\nIf it's set to Do not override events and\nit gets full, I'm not gonna be able to\n\n97\n00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.780\nwrite to the event log anymore, and I'm\ngonna lose error messages and that's bad.\n\n98\n00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.730\nI can say Overwrite events as needed,\nwhich would only do it when it gets full,\n\n99\n00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.990\nor Archive the log when it's full.\n\n100\n00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.877\nNow it will break it up into separate\nfiles, but it's up to me to go and\n\n101\n00:05:02.877 --> 00:05:05.170\nclean up those old files if I need to.\n\n102\n00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.750\nAll right, so\nthat's something we can customize and\n\n103\n00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.300\nconfigure to make sure that we get\nthe retention that we're looking for.\n\n104\n00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.570\nYou've got to plan for that.\n\n105\n00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.860\nNow it might be, on the error side, that\nyour log files are configured properly,\n\n106\n00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.940\nthat everything's configured,\nyou've got rotation in place.\n\n107\n00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.810\nBut if your disk runs out of space for\n\n108\n00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.390\nsome other reason, now you might not\nbe able to write to the log files.\n\n109\n00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.690\nSo you've always got to\nmonitor your disk utilization.\n\n110\n00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.460\nIn Windows you can use\nany number of utilities,\n\n111\n00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.000\nlike a performance monitor to do it.\n\n112\n00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.390\nYou can use third party software.\n\n113\n00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.290\nIn Unix you can use\nsimple utilities like df.\n\n114\n00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.820\ndf will show you each of your drives and\n\n115\n00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.490\nlet you evaluate how\nmuch space you've got.\n\n116\n00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.040\nSo I can see I've got plenty of\navailable space on all of my disks.\n\n117\n00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.030\nMy logs are being stored in /var/log.\n\n118\n00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.140\nAnd if I look at my mount points here,\n/var doesn't have a separate partition.\n\n119\n00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.940\nA lot of people will put /var\non a separate partition.\n\n120\n00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.870\nOn this one it's just gonna be\nright here alongside the root.\n\n121\n00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.220\nAnd that means that while I have\n34 gigs available on the root,\n\n122\n00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.980\nanything could eat up that 34 gigs and\nthat's less space available for my logs.\n\n123\n00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.813\nSo I might wanna move those\noff to a separate partition so\n\n124\n00:06:11.813 --> 00:06:13.221\nthey're isolated a little more, right?\n\n125\n00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:15.568\nIt's up to me how I want to do that.\n\n126\n00:06:15.568 --> 00:06:18.525\nAll right, there are other things that\ncould happen, for example file corruption.\n\n127\n00:06:18.525 --> 00:06:21.980\nI could have where the message\nlogs get corrupted.\n\n128\n00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.557\nBut message logs are so important that\nmost systems will just create new\n\n129\n00:06:25.557 --> 00:06:27.702\nempty ones if they ever get corrupted, and\n\n130\n00:06:27.702 --> 00:06:31.181\nthe first entry in that new file will\nbe that we had to create a new log.\n\n131\n00:06:31.181 --> 00:06:33.750\n[LAUGH] And so you'll see that right\nthere as the very first entry.\n\n132\n00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.350\nDoesn't happen often, but\nfile corruption is possible.\n\n133\n00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.723\nYou can run a surface scan of\nyour disc to look for errors.\n\n134\n00:06:38.723 --> 00:06:40.890\nIf you find any,\ndefinitely replace the disc.\n\n135\n00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.229\nI think we talked about\nthat in the last episode.\n\n136\n00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.120\nLet's see, what else do we have?\n\n137\n00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.583\nSlow operating system performance.\n\n138\n00:06:47.583 --> 00:06:49.370\nThis one just happens, right?\n\n139\n00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.220\nOperating systems always tend to\nfeel slower after time goes by.\n\n140\n00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.660\nAnd sometimes it's just perceived,\nI just feel like it's slower.\n\n141\n00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.460\nMy laptop is the exact same speed\nit was the first day I got it, but\n\n142\n00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.790\nit feels slower today than\nwhen I first got it, right?\n\n143\n00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.130\nBut sometimes it's not.\n\n144\n00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.820\nSometimes there's something actually\ndifferent on the system, and\n\n145\n00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.850\nI talked about this in\nthe server maintenance episode.\n\n146\n00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.720\nSo if you didn't watch that,\nturn back and check it.\n\n147\n00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.660\nBut what you need to do is you need to\nalways have a baseline of your server.\n\n148\n00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.575\nThat baseline is how your server\nperforms under normal conditions.\n\n149\n00:07:21.575 --> 00:07:25.707\nAnd then when things seem weird,\nyou just run the performance monitor or\n\n150\n00:07:25.707 --> 00:07:30.110\nwhatever performance logging system\nyou're using to collect new data, and\n\n151\n00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.080\nyou compare the new data to the old data.\n\n152\n00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.150\nIf it matches, your server's not slower.\n\n153\n00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.360\nBut if it doesn't match,\nyou can spot where it's different.\n\n154\n00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.316\nHey, my CPU utilization is\nhigher than it used to,\n\n155\n00:07:39.316 --> 00:07:41.370\nor my network bandwidth is\nhigher than it's used to.\n\n156\n00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:42.370\nWhy?\n\n157\n00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.870\nNow you can start digging deeper.\n\n158\n00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.290\nHow many users do I have\nsimultaneously in the system?\n\n159\n00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.490\nWhich disks are involved?\n\n160\n00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.360\nAre the disks all healthy, right?\n\n161\n00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.178\nNormally performance comes down to disk on\nmost systems, if you have spinning disks.\n\n162\n00:07:53.178 --> 00:07:55.827\nAnd if you have like a RAID 5\narray that's currently degraded,\n\n163\n00:07:55.827 --> 00:07:57.457\nthat's gonna kill your performance.\n\n164\n00:07:57.457 --> 00:07:58.669\nAnd so you can find that.\n\n165\n00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:02.178\nYou've gotta look for what's actually\ncausing that system slow down.\n\n166\n00:08:02.178 --> 00:08:03.780\nIt could just be increased usage, though.\n\n167\n00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.490\nYour company grows, resources grow.\n\n168\n00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.350\nPeople become more dependent on them and\nnow the system runs slower.\n\n169\n00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.670\nSo it's time to upgrade.\n\n170\n00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.860\nAnd you can see that with\ntrending in performance analysis.\n\n171\n00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:17.370\nI think I've mentioned that 20 times\nthis series, so I won't harp on it here.\n\n172\n00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.600\nPatch update failure.\n\n173\n00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.820\nThis is one of those that is super\nfrustrating, cuz it shouldn't happen.\n\n174\n00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.860\nBut I've had it happen.\n\n175\n00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.570\nI've had it where Microsoft releases\nService Pack 3 for an operating system.\n\n176\n00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.980\nAnd I go and download the service pack and\nI run it, and it fails to install.\n\n177\n00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.840\nHere's a service pack, a service that\nis supposed to be fixing bugs and for\n\n178\n00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.680\nsome reason, it won't install.\n\n179\n00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.990\nAll right now,\nwhy would a patch not install?\n\n180\n00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.230\nIt could be there's\na problem with the patch.\n\n181\n00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.850\nThat does happen.\n\n182\n00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.855\nEvery now and then a bad patch makes\nit through quality control and\n\n183\n00:08:45.855 --> 00:08:48.433\ngets released to the public,\nbut it's not very often.\n\n184\n00:08:48.433 --> 00:08:51.431\nIf you're ever worried about that, you\ncan always go and check the news feeds,\n\n185\n00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:54.430\nright, look at the Microsoft blog,\nor the Red Hat blog, or whatever.\n\n186\n00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.910\nGo to their communities and forums and\n\n187\n00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.585\nsee if other people\nare reporting the same problem.\n\n188\n00:08:57.585 --> 00:09:00.180\nThat's a good way to spot if\nit's a problem with the update.\n\n189\n00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.294\nBut if it's just a problem on your system,\n\n190\n00:09:02.294 --> 00:09:05.320\nthen it's normally gonna\ncome down to two things.\n\n191\n00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.380\nOne is HIPS,\nhost-based intrusion prevention systems.\n\n192\n00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.930\nThat if you have anti-virus,\nor anti-malware, or\n\n193\n00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:18.060\nif you have application whitelist,\nall those can block patches and updates.\n\n194\n00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.400\nSo, I might be trying to apply a patch,\nand my anti-virus software is stopping it,\n\n195\n00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.440\nor my intrusion prevention, or whatever it\nis that I’m running might be stopping it.\n\n196\n00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.120\nSo I might need to either white list\nthe update, or disable the HIPS\n\n197\n00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.850\nwhile I’m doing the update and\nthen I can turn the HIPS back on, right?\n\n198\n00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.620\nSo, that’s kind of one\nthing that can cause it.\n\n199\n00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.780\nThe other thing that can cause it is,\n\n200\n00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.290\noften times we can get conflicting\nupdates from different sources.\n\n201\n00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.400\nI get this with network\nadapters all the time.\n\n202\n00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.470\nIf I get a server from HPE,\nand it's got Intel NICs in it.\n\n203\n00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.990\nThose Intel NICs are gonna\nget drivers from HPE.\n\n204\n00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.980\nAnd I can download and install them and\nhave the latest drivers.\n\n205\n00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.900\nOr, are they the latest?\n\n206\n00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.760\nI can get the latest drivers\nthat HPE has certified.\n\n207\n00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.580\nBut Intel is putting out\nnew drivers all the time.\n\n208\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.260\nSo I might go to Intel's website,\nand find an even newer version.\n\n209\n00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:12.284\nMaybe HPE is pushing out 10.4.3 and\non Intel's site they have 10.4.11.\n\n210\n00:10:12.284 --> 00:10:14.410\nAnd they fixed some bug\nthat I'm experiencing.\n\n211\n00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.120\nSo I go and get Intel's version and\nI deploy it.\n\n212\n00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.670\nWell, once I've deployed that, if\nan update comes out from HPE it might be\n\n213\n00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.950\nolder than what I've already got and\nthe patch will fail to apply.\n\n214\n00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.870\nThis happens a lot with Microsoft.\n\n215\n00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:31.280\nMicrosoft does push hardware\nupdates with Windows updates.\n\n216\n00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.500\nYou do get them.\n\n217\n00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.930\nI don't know if this server has taken any,\nbut if I take this server and\n\n218\n00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:41.670\ngo into, let's see, Programs and Features.\n\n219\n00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.840\nAnd we take a look at\nthe Installed updates.\n\n220\n00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.770\nSo these are updates\nthe system has installed.\n\n221\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.670\nAnd nah, it hasn't pulled any.\n\n222\n00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.910\nWhen you look, you'll normally see\nknowledge base articles like these.\n\n223\n00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.290\nUpdate from Microsoft Windows,\nupdate from Microsoft Windows.\n\n224\n00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.870\nAnd occasionally you'll\nsee hardware drivers,\n\n225\n00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.850\nwhere it's pulled the video card driver,\nor a network card driver.\n\n226\n00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:04.610\nAnd they're almost always older than\nthe driver you can get from the OEM,\n\n227\n00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.200\nfrom the original equipment manufacturer.\n\n228\n00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.930\nSo if I were to go to Intel, or nVidia, or\n\n229\n00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.860\nwhoever, they'll have newer drivers\nthan what Microsoft is pushing.\n\n230\n00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.870\nThese are the newest drivers\nthat Microsoft has certified.\n\n231\n00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.710\nAnd so\nif I've gone off the beaten path and\n\n232\n00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:18.990\ndeployed from a vender, these might fail.\n\n233\n00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.030\nAnd if they do, I need to restrict those\nupdates and not apply them, right.\n\n234\n00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.590\nSo that it's easy to\nkind of deal with that,\n\n235\n00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.120\nbut that's usually what's gonna\nstop a patch from running.\n\n236\n00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.420\nThe other thing that can stop\na patch from running, permissions.\n\n237\n00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.020\nIn Windows you have user account control,\nor user access control.\n\n238\n00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:37.300\nAnd with UAC, only administrators\ncan perform certain actions.\n\n239\n00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.080\nSo I might have downloaded a patch and\n\n240\n00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:43.080\nif I try and run it as a regular user I\nmight not have permission to do that.\n\n241\n00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.720\nSo if I want to run it\nas an administrator,\n\n242\n00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.720\nI need to make sure I do exactly that.\n\n243\n00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.640\nThat I find the patch that I wanna run,\nand\n\n244\n00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.830\nif I right-click on that application or\npatch or whatever,\n\n245\n00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.680\nI can run it as an administrator\nto get those elevated privileges.\n\n246\n00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.520\nYou've seen me do that on my Linux box\nover here where, if I wanna run something,\n\n247\n00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:07.330\nthere might be a command that I'm not\nallowed to run as a regular user,\n\n248\n00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.030\nlike looking at the logs.\n\n249\n00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:14.700\nSo if I wanna look at my system log, and\nI go in there, I get permission denied,\n\n250\n00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.070\ncuz I'm just a regular user.\n\n251\n00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.900\nIf I'm trying to apply an update,\n\n252\n00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:23.180\nlike if I do yum update,\nI wanna update this server.\n\n253\n00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.040\nOkay, oop, you need to be\nroot to perform this command.\n\n254\n00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.420\nI can't apply the update.\n\n255\n00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.960\nBecause I'm not root.\n\n256\n00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.460\nI might be trying to update Apache,\nright, which would be httpd.\n\n257\n00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.980\nWhich I don't even know\nif I have installed.\n\n258\n00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.990\nBut either way, I can't do it.\n\n259\n00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.920\nBut if I sudo, right?\n\n260\n00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.140\nSudo is super user do.\n\n261\n00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.160\nSo, do this command as the superuser.\n\n262\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.210\nWho's the superuser?\n\n263\n00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:47.840\nRoot.\n\n264\n00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.730\nI'm gonna turn myself into root.\n\n265\n00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:50.270\nAll right.\n\n266\n00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:54.900\nSo, when I run that, now it's gonna run\nand the root user is allowed to do it.\n\n267\n00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.250\nThat's another reason why we might\nfail to run a patch or update, right?\n\n268\n00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.598\nIs that if we're not able to\ndo it because of permission.\n\n269\n00:13:02.598 --> 00:13:06.350\nSo UAC, sudu, you can use the su command.\n\n270\n00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:08.880\nYeah, here's all these updates that\nI should probably be applying,\n\n271\n00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.760\nI'm a little bit behind.\n\n272\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.480\nI'll say no for now.\n\n273\n00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.750\nThere's the su command where you're\nnot just running one command as root,\n\n274\n00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.990\nyou're actually becoming root.\n\n275\n00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.820\nAnd so when I run that,\nnow I get a whole new prompt.\n\n276\n00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.474\nInstead of saying dpezet@dplaptop,\nnow it's root@dplaptop,\n\n277\n00:13:23.474 --> 00:13:26.200\nright, now I actually am the root user.\n\n278\n00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.250\nsudo just does it for that one command.\n\n279\n00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.490\nIf I run whoami, I'm dpezet.\n\n280\n00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:37.240\nIf I run sudo whoami, I'm root.\n\n281\n00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.820\nAnd then if I run whoami again,\nI'm back to me again.\n\n282\n00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:49.800\nBut if I run su and become root,\nI can run whoami all day long.\n\n283\n00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.250\nAnd I'm gonna be root every time.\n\n284\n00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:55.400\nSo if I'm gonna do multiple commands,\nI might use su to do that.\n\n285\n00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.110\nBut they encourage you not to,\nbecause what happens?\n\n286\n00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.400\nYou run a few commands and then you\nget up and you go get some coffee.\n\n287\n00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.450\nAnd somebody could come and\nsit down right behind you and\n\n288\n00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:04.840\nnow they've got root access.\n\n289\n00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.310\nIf you had been doing sudo the whole time,\nyou'd get up and\n\n290\n00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:11.220\nyou'd go to get some coffee,\nand they come and sit down.\n\n291\n00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.450\nIt's back to just a regular user.\n\n292\n00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:18.280\nAnd if they do sudo,\nI've kinda broken the rules here and\n\n293\n00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.260\nturned off my password prompt.\n\n294\n00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.930\nWhen you do a sudo command,\n\n295\n00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.770\nyou get a window of time where\nyou're allowed to run it.\n\n296\n00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.360\nAnd I've extended mine because of the show\ncuz I get kind of annoyed having to do\n\n297\n00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.640\nthe password over and over again.\n\n298\n00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.740\nBut on a real production machine you keep\nthat window short to like five minutes.\n\n299\n00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.710\nSo for five minutes I can\nrun commands with sudo and\n\n300\n00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.690\nit'll ask me the password once.\n\n301\n00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.150\nIf somebody comes in\nfive minutes after me,\n\n302\n00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.530\nthey would have to provide\nthat password again.\n\n303\n00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.120\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n304\n00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.640\nPrivileges are usually what'll\nstop applying packages.\n\n305\n00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.070\nService failures.\n\n306\n00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:47.890\nService failures are challenging.\n\n307\n00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:48.390\nThey're tough.\n\n308\n00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.540\nIn Windows and in Linux,\nyou have services, right.\n\n309\n00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:57.120\nIn Linux, they're a little bit harder to\nsee because on sys v init systems like\n\n310\n00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.620\nany Linux system three years and\n\n311\n00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.600\nolder which is plenty of servers out\nthere that are three years and older.\n\n312\n00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.310\nThey'll use the old system and\n\n313\n00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:10.510\nyou can do a service --status-all to get\na list of the services that are running.\n\n314\n00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:14.517\nAnd when it comes up,\nmy system actually isn't sys v init,\n\n315\n00:15:14.517 --> 00:15:16.293\nso I don't see much here.\n\n316\n00:15:16.293 --> 00:15:19.120\nBut it'll give you a list of all\nthe services you're running and\n\n317\n00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.716\nwhat their status is.\n\n318\n00:15:20.716 --> 00:15:26.413\nMost systems have moved over to system D\nthough and so you can do system CTL list.\n\n319\n00:15:26.413 --> 00:15:28.430\nAnd/or it's system CTO.\n\n320\n00:15:29.874 --> 00:15:33.534\nShoot, now I forgot my command.\n\n321\n00:15:33.534 --> 00:15:35.020\nThere we go.\nJust system CTL.\n\n322\n00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.490\nAnd it will give us a list of all\nthe different targets that are running.\n\n323\n00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.090\nAnd the targets are mostly services.\n\n324\n00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.050\nBut there's other things in\nthere too like pads and scopes.\n\n325\n00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:46.290\nAnd you can see what's loaded and\nactively running and\n\n326\n00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.147\nget an idea of what's\ngoing on in the system.\n\n327\n00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:51.545\nWell, many of these things we\nexpect to be up and running.\n\n328\n00:15:51.545 --> 00:15:54.404\nIf I'm a web server, I expect the web\nservice to be up and running.\n\n329\n00:15:54.404 --> 00:15:56.111\nI can see it right here.\n\n330\n00:15:56.111 --> 00:15:56.812\nWhoops.\n\n331\n00:15:56.812 --> 00:15:59.101\n[LAUGH] I can highlight\neverything like crazy.\n\n332\n00:15:59.101 --> 00:15:59.923\nBut I can see it right here.\n\n333\n00:15:59.923 --> 00:16:02.230\nHere's the Apache HTTP server.\n\n334\n00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:03.340\nIt's up, it's loaded.\n\n335\n00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.140\nIt's active, and it's running.\n\n336\n00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.630\nIf I'm a web server,\nI need that to stay running.\n\n337\n00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:09.950\nWhat if it crashes?\n\n338\n00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:10.830\nIf it crashes, it stops running.\n\n339\n00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.570\nAnd now I'm not a web server anymore.\n\n340\n00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:13.090\nOkay?\n\n341\n00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.640\nI need a monitor for that to happen.\n\n342\n00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.528\nWell, if it crashes we should have\nsomething in the event logs letting us\n\n343\n00:16:19.528 --> 00:16:20.750\nknow that it crashed.\n\n344\n00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.515\nAnd we can look in the event logs and\nfind that,\n\n345\n00:16:22.515 --> 00:16:25.380\nit's my standard troubleshooting method,\nright?\n\n346\n00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.640\nBut some systems,\nwe might not notice it failed.\n\n347\n00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:33.730\nFor example in Windows, if I jump over\nmy Windows server, I might be using,\n\n348\n00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.640\nWindows has a built-in service recovery.\n\n349\n00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.220\nAnd the way the service recovery works,\nis,\n\n350\n00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.080\nlet's see am I running IIS on this thing?\n\n351\n00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.606\nIt's the Internet publishing service.\n\n352\n00:16:43.606 --> 00:16:44.736\nI am not.\n\n353\n00:16:44.736 --> 00:16:47.687\nSo let's just take a service\nlike the firewall, okay?\n\n354\n00:16:47.687 --> 00:16:50.474\nThe firewall is running, and\nit's automatically starting.\n\n355\n00:16:50.474 --> 00:16:52.469\nThat's what I expect to see, right?\n\n356\n00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:56.360\nAnd if I open that up,\nI can go here to recovery.\n\n357\n00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.290\nAnd it says, if the service fails,\nwhat do we do?\n\n358\n00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.080\nWe restart the service.\n\n359\n00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.050\nIf it fails a second time,\nwe restart again.\n\n360\n00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.700\nIf it fails a third time,\nwe don't do anything.\n\n361\n00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.080\nWe leave it failed.\n\n362\n00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:07.790\nWhat that means is,\n\n363\n00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.540\nthat the firewall service could\ncrash in the middle of the night.\n\n364\n00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.841\nAnd it'll just restart it.\n\n365\n00:17:11.841 --> 00:17:13.140\nAnd I won't even know it.\n\n366\n00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.530\nAnd I come in in the morning and\neverything's fine.\n\n367\n00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:16.280\nI don't know it.\n\n368\n00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.460\nIt recovered.\n\n369\n00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.340\nIn the Linux world you can use, there's\na number of service monitors out there, or\n\n370\n00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.390\nyou can just use Chron Jobs to check and\nstart the service periodically.\n\n371\n00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:24.730\nIt's easy enough to do.\n\n372\n00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.700\nA lot of services recover on their own and\nstart, and you don't notice.\n\n373\n00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:33.720\nThat's why it's so important to come in\nand configure things like notifications,\n\n374\n00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:38.326\nso that if one of these crashes that it\ndoes send you some kind of information.\n\n375\n00:17:38.326 --> 00:17:41.070\nAn event log message that\ntriggers an email, or a page, or\n\n376\n00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:44.560\nsomething like that to let you\nknow that the failure happened.\n\n377\n00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.300\nBut these types of\nrecovery options are nice,\n\n378\n00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.445\nbecause they get the system\nback online for your users.\n\n379\n00:17:49.445 --> 00:17:51.580\nBut they're bad in that if\nyou're not monitoring it,\n\n380\n00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.090\nyou could be having failures and\nnot be aware of it.\n\n381\n00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.730\nSo always be careful with that.\n\n382\n00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:59.350\nNow, if a service crashes, it usually\nmeans that it encountered some kind of\n\n383\n00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:03.990\nstop error, like a buffer overflow,\nor a seg fault, or whatever.\n\n384\n00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.690\nIt'll typically log to its messages, and\nyou'll need to look for the logs for\n\n385\n00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:07.740\nthat service.\n\n386\n00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.090\nI've been harping on about\nthe system logs, but\n\n387\n00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.670\nmost services have their own logs.\n\n388\n00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:16.110\nSo, for example,\nin the Windows event viewer,\n\n389\n00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:22.550\nI've been going under Windows logs and\nsystem.\n\n390\n00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.060\nWhich is for the entire operating system.\n\n391\n00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.510\nBut you've also got the application\nlogs for the various programs.\n\n392\n00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:31.370\nAnd if you go down here under\napplications, you can split that up and\n\n393\n00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.618\nstart to see all the various services.\n\n394\n00:18:33.618 --> 00:18:38.760\nAnd each of them maintains their own\nindividual log, which is kind of nice.\n\n395\n00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.670\nCuz I can pull up a filtered view that\nis just showing me Windows Firewall.\n\n396\n00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.340\nHere's my, if I can get my zoom right.\n\n397\n00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:50.990\nHere's my Windows Firewall logs, and\nwhat's going on in Windows Firewall land.\n\n398\n00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:54.560\nSo, we can expand that out and\ntake a look at, I'll just do Firewall.\n\n399\n00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.990\nAnd not a whole heck of a lot going on.\n\n400\n00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:59.610\nApparently just some\ninformational messages,\n\n401\n00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.240\nthat's what I hope to see, right?\n\n402\n00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.510\nBut you might find errors for\nthat particular service.\n\n403\n00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.310\nSame thing goes for Linux.\n\n404\n00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.102\nIf I actually get on a Linux system.\n\n405\n00:19:07.102 --> 00:19:13.147\nBut if I poke around inside of\nthe /var/log, you'll find log messages for\n\n406\n00:19:13.147 --> 00:19:17.190\nall sorts of different things,\nlike Apache.\n\n407\n00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.250\nHere's httpd, right?\n\n408\n00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.945\nAnd so I can jump into httpd,\nwhich I'm gonna be denied.\n\n409\n00:19:26.362 --> 00:19:27.550\nThere.\n\n410\n00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.240\nAnd here's access logs.\n\n411\n00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.667\nSo I can view who's been accessing\nthe system, what have they accessed,\n\n412\n00:19:32.667 --> 00:19:34.130\ndid I get any errors.\n\n413\n00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.341\nAnd I can look for the error there, and\nfind out why that service crashed, and\n\n414\n00:19:37.341 --> 00:19:38.090\nget it resolved.\n\n415\n00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.170\nIt may just be as simple\nas doing an update.\n\n416\n00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.002\nI may have a bad entry in\na configuration file, but\n\n417\n00:19:43.002 --> 00:19:45.104\nit'll be there, in that Error log.\n\n418\n00:19:45.104 --> 00:19:49.536\nIf you don't see your error here,\non newer system D systems,\n\n419\n00:19:49.536 --> 00:19:51.505\nyou also have journalctl.\n\n420\n00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:57.510\nAnd journalctl shows you another\nset of logs which are basically\n\n421\n00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:59.720\na mirror of the sys logs.\n\n422\n00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:05.230\nBut over the next series of years,\nwe're gonna see the journal D replace.\n\n423\n00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.940\nThe sys log system in several distros.\n\n424\n00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:10.910\nSo just be aware of journalctl as\nanother log that you can view.\n\n425\n00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.460\nAlright only a couple, I know we're\nalmost to the end of the list guys.\n\n426\n00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.010\nAnd we've been through a lot\nin these last couple of parts.\n\n427\n00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.486\nThe next one is Hangs no shut down.\n\n428\n00:20:20.486 --> 00:20:22.040\nAll right, Hangs no shutdown.\n\n429\n00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.990\nThat sounds a lot like when I was talking\nabout stop errors earlier, right?\n\n430\n00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.120\nIn part one we talked about\nblue screens of death.\n\n431\n00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:28.890\nOr part two.\n\n432\n00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.080\nBlue screens of death and stop messages.\n\n433\n00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:35.280\nAnd when those happen, you get an error on\nthe screen and then the system reboots.\n\n434\n00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:41.320\nWell, occasionally,\nyou can get full-on total hang.\n\n435\n00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:45.500\nA total hang is where the system\nfreezes and then does nothing.\n\n436\n00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.850\nIt just sits there.\n\n437\n00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:49.340\nKeyboard's not responsive,\nmouse isn't responsive.\n\n438\n00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.470\nThe system doesn't reboot.\n\n439\n00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.170\nRight?\nIt just sits there.\n\n440\n00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:56.660\nThis happens when there's an error so bad.\n\n441\n00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:01.480\nThat even the kernel monitor isn't able to\ndo a kernel dump and reboot the system.\n\n442\n00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.930\nUnfortunately, it is very,\n\n443\n00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:07.200\nvery difficult to have a software\nprogram cause that kind of error.\n\n444\n00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.680\nIt's almost always a hardware problem.\n\n445\n00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.830\nSo why are we talking about it\ninsoftware trouble-shooting?\n\n446\n00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.290\nBecause we see the results in software.\n\n447\n00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:18.110\nYou see your software operating\nsystem stop working without a reboot,\n\n448\n00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.710\nhangs, it doesn't reboot.\n\n449\n00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.333\nRight?\nBut the problem is almost always hardware,\n\n450\n00:21:21.333 --> 00:21:22.770\nand it's almost always RAM.\n\n451\n00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:26.720\nIf you've got a bad stick of RAM,\nor if you've got some kind of short\n\n452\n00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.010\non the motherboard, that can result in\nyour system just completely hanging.\n\n453\n00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:32.341\nAlso temperature.\n\n454\n00:21:32.341 --> 00:21:36.358\nIf you've got a very hot server room\nwhere your server's just getting hot,\n\n455\n00:21:36.358 --> 00:21:39.820\nif a CPU is getting baked,\nthat can cause a hang like that.\n\n456\n00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.670\nSo you need to start\nexamining your hardware.\n\n457\n00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:46.270\nIf I have a server that just does a total\nhang like that, the first thing I do,\n\n458\n00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.000\nrun a hardware diagnostic.\n\n459\n00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.166\nIf it's a Dell server,\nI go Dell's site and\n\n460\n00:21:50.166 --> 00:21:52.400\nI get their Dell\ndiagnostic bootable media.\n\n461\n00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.927\nI boot off of that, and\nI run the hardware diagnostic.\n\n462\n00:21:54.927 --> 00:21:57.250\nIf it's HP, I do the same thing,\nbut with their diagnostic.\n\n463\n00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:00.150\nEach of them have their own little\ndiagnostic you can run and more\n\n464\n00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.530\noften than not, you'll find a hardware\nfailure that goes along with that, okay?\n\n465\n00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.393\nNow if you don't find a hardware,\nif the hardware is fine and\n\n466\n00:22:06.393 --> 00:22:10.056\nyou're getting a hang like that,\nthat usually means something really bad.\n\n467\n00:22:10.056 --> 00:22:12.055\nIt's gotta be something\nwith that operating system,\n\n468\n00:22:12.055 --> 00:22:14.160\nand I'll typically rebuild the server.\n\n469\n00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.700\nGo to your backups,\nbring the system back up from backups.\n\n470\n00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:17.550\nIt sounds like a lot of work,\n\n471\n00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.000\nbut I don't want a server that's\njust gonna randomly freeze.\n\n472\n00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.274\nWho knows when that outage is gonna be?\n\n473\n00:22:21.274 --> 00:22:22.398\nIt's time to rebuild.\n\n474\n00:22:22.398 --> 00:22:23.750\nAll right?\nBut I'll always check the hardware,\n\n475\n00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:24.979\nbecause that's usually where\nthat one will come from.\n\n476\n00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.073\nAll right, the last one is becoming\na decreasing problem over the years.\n\n477\n00:22:30.073 --> 00:22:31.690\nAnd it's users can't print.\n\n478\n00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.340\nWhen I used to film these shows,\n\n479\n00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:37.000\nI would always talk about how most users\nare happy as long as they can print.\n\n480\n00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.590\nIt's the moment a user can't print\nthat they really start to annoy\n\n481\n00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:40.500\nthe heck out of you.\n\n482\n00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.470\nI don't know why people always had this\ndependency on printing, but now thanks to\n\n483\n00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:47.640\nemail, people email attachments and\nwe see people print a lot less.\n\n484\n00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.200\nBut, if people can't print,\nthey still get annoyed.\n\n485\n00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.480\nAnd usually printer errors come\ndown to just a couple of things.\n\n486\n00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.990\nPermissions can be a big part.\n\n487\n00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.530\nIf you don't have permission\nto access the printer,\n\n488\n00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:57.670\nyou're not going to be able to print.\n\n489\n00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:59.320\nBut, that's not normally a random thing.\n\n490\n00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.330\nThey usually either never had\nthe permissions or they always had them.\n\n491\n00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:02.920\nOne or the other.\n\n492\n00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.160\nIt's not like we're changing\npermissions all the time.\n\n493\n00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:05.960\nWell maybe you are.\n\n494\n00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.524\nMaybe you get bored and you do it.\n\n495\n00:23:07.524 --> 00:23:10.880\nBut other things that can cause\nus not to be able to print.\n\n496\n00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.520\nRunning out of disk space.\n\n497\n00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.110\nRight?\n\n498\n00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:17.040\nWhen you print what you're printing\nto is actually printing to a driver,\n\n499\n00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.400\nlike a virtual device.\n\n500\n00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.330\nAnd it takes your print job and\nit turns it into an image and\n\n501\n00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.040\nit stores it on the hard drive.\n\n502\n00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.281\nAnd then it takes that image and\n\n503\n00:23:23.281 --> 00:23:25.686\nit sends that to the physical\nprinter where it gets output.\n\n504\n00:23:25.686 --> 00:23:27.351\nAnd once it comes out of\nthe physical printer,\n\n505\n00:23:27.351 --> 00:23:29.430\nthen it deletes the image\non the hard drive.\n\n506\n00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.430\nWell if your hard drive is full,\ncan you print?\n\n507\n00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:33.399\nNot usually.\n\n508\n00:23:33.399 --> 00:23:36.663\nSome systems like Cups under Linux,\nyou can tell it to just cache in RAM, but\n\n509\n00:23:36.663 --> 00:23:39.366\nthe problem in caching in RAM is\nif the server ever reboots or for\n\n510\n00:23:39.366 --> 00:23:41.120\nsome reason you lose all the print jobs.\n\n511\n00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.895\nIf it's written to the hard drive,\nyou can reboot and\n\n512\n00:23:42.895 --> 00:23:44.050\nthen the jobs are all still there.\n\n513\n00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:46.627\nSo, they normally write to the disk,\nand if the disk is full,\n\n514\n00:23:46.627 --> 00:23:48.475\nyou're not gonna be able to print, right?\n\n515\n00:23:48.475 --> 00:23:49.908\nSo that can cause it.\n\n516\n00:23:49.908 --> 00:23:52.500\nBut the other thing that can\ncause it is just print drivers.\n\n517\n00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.709\nPrinter drivers are weird.\n\n518\n00:23:54.709 --> 00:23:57.541\nThere are so many different types of\nprinters these days because they couldn't\n\n519\n00:23:57.541 --> 00:23:58.481\nleave well enough alone.\n\n520\n00:23:58.481 --> 00:23:59.830\nIt's kinda like cell phones, right?\n\n521\n00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:02.500\nYou get a cell phone, it can make phone\ncalls, and it can send an email, and\n\n522\n00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.680\nit can browse the web, and it can play\nmusic, and it's got bluetooth and all\n\n523\n00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.950\nthis crazy stuff that has nothing to do\nwith phone calls, but it does it, right?\n\n524\n00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:09.630\nThat's how printers are.\n\n525\n00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:14.349\nThey have scanners built in to them,\nand staplers, and hole-punchers,\n\n526\n00:24:14.349 --> 00:24:18.110\nand paper trays, and\nall sorts of crazy stuff on them.\n\n527\n00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.282\nRight, you can watch SportsCenter on them.\n\n528\n00:24:20.282 --> 00:24:23.060\nAnd it's just way more than\nwhat a normal printer does.\n\n529\n00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.500\nSo you need special drivers and\nsoftware to be able to handle that.\n\n530\n00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.760\nWell operating system patches and\nupdates can break those drivers.\n\n531\n00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.480\nThe drivers themselves are not\nnormally all that well written.\n\n532\n00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.620\nSo we need to make sure those\ndrivers are staying up to date and\n\n533\n00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:35.870\nthat they're compatible.\n\n534\n00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:37.770\nIf I'm using a print server,\n\n535\n00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.750\nI'll have a server that might be\na 64 bit server with 64 bit drivers.\n\n536\n00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:45.460\nAnd then I have clients that might\nbe 32 bit, using 32 bit drivers.\n\n537\n00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.190\nNot exactly compatible, are they?\n\n538\n00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.770\nWell, maybe they are.\n\n539\n00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:50.760\nMaybe the print job is the same and\nit moves through just fine.\n\n540\n00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.510\nOr maybe they aren't.\n\n541\n00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.150\nI need to evaluate that and\nfind out is that a viable alternative?\n\n542\n00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:55.010\nCan I use that?\n\n543\n00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:58.360\nOr I might be in a situation where\neven though I have a 64-bit server,\n\n544\n00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:02.570\nI have to use the 32-bit driver to match\nthe clients, to make sure it communicates.\n\n545\n00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.120\nIt's not always like that,\nbut I have seen it.\n\n546\n00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.380\nSo we always doublecheck those drivers.\n\n547\n00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.860\nThat's a big part of\nbring unable to print.\n\n548\n00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.410\nPermissions and drivers.\n\n549\n00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:12.710\nThat's usually where we go.\n\n550\n00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.830\nRunning out of disk space\nis usually pretty obvious,\n\n551\n00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:16.220\nbut it's another possibility.\n\n552\n00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.560\nAlso keep in mind that most printers\nare network printers these days.\n\n553\n00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.670\nSo people aren't using a print servers,\nthey're going straight to the printer and\n\n554\n00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:24.630\nthat bypasses this need.\n\n555\n00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.100\nThat's another reason why we see\nthis less and less these days.\n\n556\n00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.740\nAll right, I think we chewed through\nall the common problems at this point.\n\n557\n00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.210\nThere's only a few little things\nthat I haven't mentioned.\n\n558\n00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:37.500\nOn the printing side\nthere is one other thing,\n\n559\n00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.070\nlike if there's a printer driver issue.\n\n560\n00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:43.570\nThere's normally a sister service that\ngoes along with it called a print spooler.\n\n561\n00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.044\nWhen you write to the hard drive,\nit's the spooler that does that, and\n\n562\n00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:46.919\nthe spooler could stop.\n\n563\n00:25:46.919 --> 00:25:51.110\nSo the old fix in Windows that we used to\nalways do is just restart that service.\n\n564\n00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:54.390\nSo, if you jump into your Windows\nservices, you can hunt in here and\n\n565\n00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.030\nfind that print spooler.\n\n566\n00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:56.950\nIt'll be buried in here.\n\n567\n00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:59.850\nIt's usually just called print spooler.\n\n568\n00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:05.020\nAnd restarting that print spooler\ncan cause it to reload the drivers,\n\n569\n00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.330\nand when it reloads the drivers\nthat can fix a problem, right?\n\n570\n00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:08.540\nIt doesn't change the drivers.\n\n571\n00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.997\nIf you've got a bad driver,\nit's still gonna be bad and\n\n572\n00:26:09.997 --> 00:26:10.995\nyou're still not gonna be printing.\n\n573\n00:26:10.995 --> 00:26:14.840\nBut if your jobs are stuck, that kind\nof frees it up and move it along.\n\n574\n00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.859\nSame thing in Linux with the CUPS system,\nyou can restart its service and\n\n575\n00:26:17.859 --> 00:26:19.854\nthen off you go there and\nyou're able to print.\n\n576\n00:26:19.854 --> 00:26:23.210\nCUPS is the Common Unix Print Service.\n\n577\n00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:27.380\nIt's the equivalent of\nthe Windows print spooler system.\n\n578\n00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:30.600\nAll right Don, well we've been through\na lot of different situations here.\n\n579\n00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.476\nA lot of technologies and\n\n580\n00:26:31.476 --> 00:26:33.488\nit does look like we're coming\nto the end of the episode.\n\n581\n00:26:33.488 --> 00:26:37.560\nBut before we do, do you have any last\nthings maybe you would like to talk about\n\n582\n00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.560\nor maybe some words of advice when it\ncomes to troubleshooting software?\n\n583\n00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.832\n&gt;&gt; All right, I have one last thing I have\nto mention to be objective completely.\n\n584\n00:26:45.832 --> 00:26:48.262\nWe wanna make sure we cover\nall the exam objective and\n\n585\n00:26:48.262 --> 00:26:51.660\nCompTIA calls out disk fragmentation,\nright?\n\n586\n00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:55.635\nIn today's world, we don't worry\nabout disk fragmentation anymore.\n\n587\n00:26:55.635 --> 00:26:58.135\nIf you have SSDs,\nfragmentation's actually a good thing.\n\n588\n00:26:58.135 --> 00:27:01.085\nYou're able to read and write from\ndifferent sectors at the same speed as if\n\n589\n00:27:01.085 --> 00:27:03.455\nthey were all in order, so\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n590\n00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:08.347\nEven on spinning disks, though,\nmost of our file systems, like EXT4, and\n\n591\n00:27:08.347 --> 00:27:11.897\nXFS, NTFS, they're all self defragmenting.\n\n592\n00:27:11.897 --> 00:27:15.047\nSo as files get broken up on the disk,\nthe next time you access them,\n\n593\n00:27:15.047 --> 00:27:16.497\nit tries to fix it for you.\n\n594\n00:27:16.497 --> 00:27:18.454\nSo for most of us,\nwe never worry about fragmentation.\n\n595\n00:27:18.454 --> 00:27:19.917\nBut they do call it out on the exam.\n\n596\n00:27:19.917 --> 00:27:23.602\nIf you see server performance starting\nto decline, usually it's after you done\n\n597\n00:27:23.602 --> 00:27:27.230\nlike millions of deletes, if you have a\nton of small files, then you start to see\n\n598\n00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:31.270\nperformance declining, and\nyou might need to run a defragmentation.\n\n599\n00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:34.270\nIn the Linux and\nUnix world it's done automatically,\n\n600\n00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:37.130\nin the Windows world it's done\nautomatically too if you've got NTFS.\n\n601\n00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:40.780\nBut if you're still running FAT32,\nor exFAT, they fragment,\n\n602\n00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.900\nand they don't automatically defragment.\n\n603\n00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.370\nAnd so on those scenarios you\nmight need to defragment.\n\n604\n00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:48.400\nIt's very uncommon, but it is\nsomething that's still out there, and\n\n605\n00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.010\nthe tools are all still in there.\n\n606\n00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:52.860\nIf I take my Windows Server\nthat I've got sitting here.\n\n607\n00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.110\nLet me just bring up computer management.\n\n608\n00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.490\nWe can get into our disk management.\n\n609\n00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:03.660\nAnd inside of disk management, you can\npick a disk and pull up its properties.\n\n610\n00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.010\nAnd in the Tools screen.\n\n611\n00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:08.690\nI brought this screen up earlier when I\nwas showing some of the like check for\n\n612\n00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:09.730\nerrors and stuff.\n\n613\n00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:11.980\nYou've got optimize and defragment drive.\n\n614\n00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.320\nSo, I can actually defragment right here.\n\n615\n00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.240\nBut, I'll tell you right now,\nif you have SSD.\n\n616\n00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.130\nIt's not gonna make any difference, right?\n\n617\n00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.950\nYou don't need to defragment.\n\n618\n00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.110\nIf you've got NTFS,\nit's self defragmenting.\n\n619\n00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.830\nSo, you really shouldn't\nhave to mess with it,\n\n620\n00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:30.640\nunless you've done millions of small\ndeletes all in a short period of time.\n\n621\n00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.020\nSo really just comes down to FAT32 and\nexFAT.\n\n622\n00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.600\nIf you got file systems that are like\nthat, you need to come in here.\n\n623\n00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.050\nDo a quick analyze.\n\n624\n00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:41.160\nAnd then run the defragmentation just to\nmake sure all the files are in order to\n\n625\n00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.090\noptimize performance.\n\n626\n00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:44.786\nSo they call it [INAUDIBLE] objectives,\nbecause you might have older servers.\n\n627\n00:28:44.786 --> 00:28:46.341\nYou might still have some\nof those file systems.\n\n628\n00:28:46.341 --> 00:28:49.908\nBut if you do, your real troubleshooting\nsteps here should be finding out why you\n\n629\n00:28:49.908 --> 00:28:51.940\nhaven't planned to replace them yet.\n\n630\n00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.320\nThat would be the real step.\n\n631\n00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.610\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that's a great place\nto round this one up, Don, as always.\n\n632\n00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.870\nWe do appreciate having you\nwith us in the studios.\n\n633\n00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.870\nAnd we appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n634\n00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:03.890\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.664 --> 00:00:07.485\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:11.022\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.900\nHello and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITPro TV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.730\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\ntoday's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.200\nwe're continuing through our\nseries on CompTIA Server+ SK0-004.\n\n9\n00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.499\nAnd joining us in the studios today\nis non other than Mister Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:26.420\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.787\n&gt;&gt; I am doing swell Wes, ready to dive\nright back in to troubleshooting.\n\n12\n00:00:28.787 --> 00:00:31.950\n&gt;&gt; We've talked about hardware,\nwe've talked about software.\n\n13\n00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.340\nNow we're gonna jump over to networking,\n\n14\n00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.560\nand networking is kind of a fun one\nto troubleshoot on a server because\n\n15\n00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.330\nit's pretty rare that the problem\nis on the server itself.\n\n16\n00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.370\nUsually when there's a network issue it's,\nwell, it's the network, right?\n\n17\n00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.293\nI mean that's the whole\npoint of a network issue.\n\n18\n00:00:45.293 --> 00:00:50.040\nBut we don't normally see it on\nthe network, we see it on the server.\n\n19\n00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.750\nSo the issue develops,\nwe see an issue on our server, and\n\n20\n00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.640\nthen we need to troubleshoot and\nfigure out where that problem is.\n\n21\n00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.429\nAnd if it does turn out to\nbe problem on the server,\n\n22\n00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:58.846\nobviously we can resolve it and fix it.\n\n23\n00:00:58.846 --> 00:01:00.864\nBut if it's a problem on the network,\n\n24\n00:01:00.864 --> 00:01:04.470\nwe can engage with the networking\nservices team, or whoever it is.\n\n25\n00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.016\nIn a small business, it might be you.\n\n26\n00:01:06.016 --> 00:01:09.251\nIn a large organization,\nyou'll have a separate network team, and\n\n27\n00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:12.152\nyou can engage with them and\nprovide them the information that\n\n28\n00:01:12.152 --> 00:01:14.620\nwill best help them define and\nresolve the issue.\n\n29\n00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.130\nRight, that's really\nwhat this is all about,\n\n30\n00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.930\nis we wanna help people have the right\ninformation to solve problems as\n\n31\n00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.290\nquickly as possible.\n\n32\n00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.610\nWell, in the server world,\n\n33\n00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.670\nthere's not all that much variation\nin the way of networking, right?\n\n34\n00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.270\nIf you think about it, like a laptop.\n\n35\n00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.830\nI might have wireless connectivity,\nI might have wired connectivity.\n\n36\n00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.198\nI might have a cellular\ncard plugged into it.\n\n37\n00:01:35.198 --> 00:01:37.043\nBut what are we gonna have in a server?\n\n38\n00:01:37.043 --> 00:01:38.223\nWell in a server,\n\n39\n00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:43.358\nwe're usually just going to have\nphysical network adapters and that's it.\n\n40\n00:01:43.358 --> 00:01:48.067\nSo when I jump into my network screens\nhere and I go to change my adapter\n\n41\n00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:52.950\nsetting, I'm just gonna see pretty\nmuch typical ethernet adapters.\n\n42\n00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.700\nI may have one, I may have two,\nI may have four but\n\n43\n00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.710\nthey're normally going to be\ncopper based ethernet adapters.\n\n44\n00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.190\nYou may have fiber from time to time, but\n\n45\n00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.840\neven the fiber ones\nare ethernet at this point.\n\n46\n00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.106\nSo the technology is so consistent that\nit makes troubleshooting things very,\n\n47\n00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:09.810\nvery simple and pretty straightforward.\n\n48\n00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.820\nAlso there's a lot of technology\nthat you use on a mobile device or\n\n49\n00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.240\na desktop that you don't\nuse on the server side.\n\n50\n00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.270\nFor example, DHCP right?\n\n51\n00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.483\nDHCP, dynamic host configuration protocol.\n\n52\n00:02:18.483 --> 00:02:23.930\nCompTIA calls that as one of the common\nproblems is DHCP server misconfigured.\n\n53\n00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.720\nIt can be misconfigured, absolutely.\n\n54\n00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.092\nAnd for work stations, that will\nreally affect them, but for servers,\n\n55\n00:02:29.092 --> 00:02:30.819\nwe typically do static IPs, right.\n\n56\n00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.470\nSo that's not really something\nwe have to worry about.\n\n57\n00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.420\nBut not always, there are plenty of\norganizations that leverage DHCP\n\n58\n00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.900\nwith their servers and\nyou really see it in the cloud.\n\n59\n00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.100\nWhen we're deploying cloud services,\nwe're doing things like with Amazon's EC2,\n\n60\n00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.438\nyou can do auto-scaling.\n\n61\n00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:50.680\nSo I might have ten servers right now and\nas things get busy, it grows to 20 or\n\n62\n00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.960\n50 servers.\n\n63\n00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.615\nWell if those servers are just\nspinning up almost at random,\n\n64\n00:02:55.615 --> 00:02:59.998\nI can't be assigning static IPs to all\nof them and keeping track of that.\n\n65\n00:02:59.998 --> 00:03:04.165\nI need this to be dynamic,\nso they're gonna use DHCP.\n\n66\n00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:07.675\nOr I might be using static IPs, but\n\n67\n00:03:07.675 --> 00:03:12.205\nstill using DHCP to get things like\nmy DNS servers or my default gateway.\n\n68\n00:03:12.205 --> 00:03:15.314\nYou can get pieces of your network\nconfiguration with DHCP and\n\n69\n00:03:15.314 --> 00:03:17.004\nhave other parts of it be static.\n\n70\n00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:19.837\nNow, why don't we use DHCP with a server?\n\n71\n00:03:19.837 --> 00:03:20.407\nWell, why not?\n\n72\n00:03:20.407 --> 00:03:24.197\nWell, we typically don't want one server\n\n73\n00:03:24.197 --> 00:03:27.660\nto be dependent on another server\nunless we absolutely have to.\n\n74\n00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.320\nIf I have a web server and the content\non that website is being rendered from\n\n75\n00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.110\na database, the web server is\ndependent on the database.\n\n76\n00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.070\nSo if the database goes offline,\nthe website doesn't work.\n\n77\n00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.440\nIf the website goes offline,\npeople can't get to the database.\n\n78\n00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.791\nSo those two are dependent and\nthere's not much you can do about that.\n\n79\n00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:45.810\nBut a DHCP server,\n\n80\n00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.860\nwhat happens if the DHCP server's\noffline and my server reboots?\n\n81\n00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.439\nIt can't get an address, right?\n\n82\n00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.860\nIf it can't get an address, nobody can\nget to it, it's not gonna function.\n\n83\n00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.550\nAnd all I had to do was assign a static IP\nand I didn't have to have that dependency.\n\n84\n00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.140\nSo if we can eliminate that dependency,\nall the better.\n\n85\n00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.765\nBut not everybody does that because you're\nplanning for things like autoscaling,\n\n86\n00:04:06.765 --> 00:04:10.865\nwhere it becomes important to have\nflexibility over reduced dependency.\n\n87\n00:04:10.865 --> 00:04:15.890\nNow, how do we solve that flexibility\nover reduced dependency thing?\n\n88\n00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.990\nWe have more servers,\nmore networks, right?\n\n89\n00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.548\nIf you're deploying in the cloud,\nyou just don't deploy in one data center,\n\n90\n00:04:20.548 --> 00:04:22.271\nyou deploy in two, or three,\nor four data centers.\n\n91\n00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:25.854\nAnd that if the DHCP system fails in\none center, you still have servers in\n\n92\n00:04:25.854 --> 00:04:30.120\nthe other centers that are working just\nfine, so you overcome it by scale.\n\n93\n00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.188\nAnd if you're in an enterprise environment\nyou probably have 100s, 1,000s,\n\n94\n00:04:34.188 --> 00:04:38.580\n10,000s of servers, it's very realistic\nthat you have that kind of model.\n\n95\n00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.190\nIn a medium sized business or\na small business,\n\n96\n00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.310\nyou probably do all static IPs\non your servers to reduce that.\n\n97\n00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.940\nWhenever you do static IPs, there's\nalways the risk of misconfiguration.\n\n98\n00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.890\nYou could misconfigure the IP address,\nalthough that doesn't normally happen.\n\n99\n00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.610\nNormally, it's misconfiguring\nthe subnet mask with a default gateway.\n\n100\n00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.230\nIf I put the wrong subnet mask in, I don't\nknow what hosts are on my network and\n\n101\n00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.990\nwhat hosts aren't on my network.\n\n102\n00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.190\nSo for example, here in the ITProTV\nstudios, we use the 10-dot Network.\n\n103\n00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.518\nAnd most of our equipment, like this\nserver that I'm connected to right now,\n\n104\n00:05:11.518 --> 00:05:15.717\nthis server is, actually I'm\nprobably gonna regret this but\n\n105\n00:05:15.717 --> 00:05:18.238\nI think it's actually set for DHCP.\n\n106\n00:05:18.238 --> 00:05:20.570\n[LAUGH] No, it does have a static IP,\nso this is server has a static IP.\n\n107\n00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.785\nAnd it's on the 10-dot network,\nsee how it's 10.0.222.223?\n\n108\n00:05:24.785 --> 00:05:28.200\nWell, let's say that\ninformation wasn't in there.\n\n109\n00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.400\nWhen I fill this out and I come in to\nstart typing all of the information in\n\n110\n00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.080\nthat it needs for an IP address,\nMicrosoft tries to help me.\n\n111\n00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.130\nAnd so when I type in 10.0.222.223 and\nhit Tab,\n\n112\n00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.910\nsee how it tried to fill\nin the subnet mask for me?\n\n113\n00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.690\nAnd it looked at that first octet and\nsaid, well back in the old days,\n\n114\n00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.780\nsomething that starts with a 10 would be\na Class A, and that's gonna be 255.0.0.0.\n\n115\n00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.363\nSo it puts that in as a suggestion.\n\n116\n00:05:56.363 --> 00:06:00.265\nBut we don't use it that way here\nin the studio, here in the studio,\n\n117\n00:06:00.265 --> 00:06:02.402\nit's actually 255 255 0 0.\n\n118\n00:06:02.402 --> 00:06:03.394\nWe treat it as a Class B so\n\n119\n00:06:03.394 --> 00:06:06.530\nthat we have enough IPs to handle\nthe machines here on the network.\n\n120\n00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.115\nAnd then we have a VPN network that\nuses 10.1, I think, and 10.2 and\n\n121\n00:06:09.115 --> 00:06:12.640\n10.3 are used by some of the other\ntenants here in the building.\n\n122\n00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.457\nAnd they get used by other people.\n\n123\n00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:18.554\nIf I use the wrong subnet mask,\nI'm gonna assume that anybody that\n\n124\n00:06:18.554 --> 00:06:22.225\nstarts with 10-dot is gonna\nbe on the same network as me.\n\n125\n00:06:22.225 --> 00:06:26.820\nAnd I can get to them without going\nthrough a router, but that's not true.\n\n126\n00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.130\nIn reality, I can only get to\npeople who start with 10.0 and\n\n127\n00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.900\nmy subnet mask has to be correct.\n\n128\n00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.790\nSo if you have a server that is unable\nto connect to some internal hosts but\n\n129\n00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.460\ncan connect to others, it's oftentimes\ntied to an incorrect subnet mask.\n\n130\n00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.768\nAnd we can correct that pretty easily and\nget it put back in place.\n\n131\n00:06:44.768 --> 00:06:48.111\nThese auto-suggested subnet masks\nare pretty frequently wrong, because a lot\n\n132\n00:06:48.111 --> 00:06:51.390\nof us are doing what's called VLSM,\nVariable Length Subnet Masking.\n\n133\n00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.550\nWe're changing the length\nof the subnet mask and\n\n134\n00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.560\nthrowing away the old classical system.\n\n135\n00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.680\nSo, you can't interpret, you can't guess\nwhat the subnet mask is going to be.\n\n136\n00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:03.874\nNow, the default gateway, that's when I'm\ngonna be talking to somebody who's not on\n\n137\n00:07:03.874 --> 00:07:05.790\nthe same network as me.\n\n138\n00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.660\nIf I leave it empty like this, I can talk\nto other people on the same network, but\n\n139\n00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.330\nI can't talk to people\non a different network.\n\n140\n00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.680\nSo I'd be able to talk to\nanybody who started with 10.0\n\n141\n00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.800\nregardless of what the rest of their IP\nwas, I could talk to somebody who's 10.0.\n\n142\n00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.645\nBut if I wanted to talk to somebody that\nwas 10.1 or 172.16 or any other number,\n\n143\n00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:26.656\nI would have to go through a gateway.\n\n144\n00:07:26.656 --> 00:07:28.670\nAnd if I don't have one,\nI won't be able to do it.\n\n145\n00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.770\nSo missing a default gateway will cause\n\n146\n00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.150\nyou to not have a route\nto get to the host.\n\n147\n00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.990\nAnd there's several of the common problems\nthat CompTIA calls out that are really\n\n148\n00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.960\nthe resulting error messages of a ping.\n\n149\n00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.860\nAnd when you run a ping,\n\n150\n00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.620\nyou're testing the network to see if\nyou can get between two locations.\n\n151\n00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.838\nAnd the answer you get back is going\nto guide you kind of into what that\n\n152\n00:07:49.838 --> 00:07:50.662\nproblem is.\n\n153\n00:07:50.662 --> 00:07:54.461\nAnd in this scenario,\nwhere we have no default gateway,\n\n154\n00:07:54.461 --> 00:07:59.935\nif I don't have a way to get there, Well\nthat's gonna be no route to destination.\n\n155\n00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:02.139\nI've got no route,\nno way to get there, right?\n\n156\n00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:03.520\nI have to have a way.\n\n157\n00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.200\nNow I'm gonna leave that gateway\noff on purpose so that we can kinda\n\n158\n00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.260\ntrouble shoot what that would look like\non a system that can't communicate.\n\n159\n00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.020\nNow I'm remoted into this\nserver from my laptop.\n\n160\n00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.180\nAnd when I change that subnet mask,\nI'm gonna get disconnected, right?\n\n161\n00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.850\nSee there I got disconnected.\n\n162\n00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.170\nWhy did that happen?\n\n163\n00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.180\nWhen you change the IP address,\nit resets the network adapter.\n\n164\n00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.530\nAnd when that adapter resets, remote\nconnections like mine get disconnected.\n\n165\n00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.310\nNow I'll reconnect in a little bit.\n\n166\n00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.630\nEven though it doesn't have a default\ngateway, if I just wait here a second.\n\n167\n00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.520\nAnd there we go, all right.\n\n168\n00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.480\nSo now I'm reconnected, I'm back in.\n\n169\n00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.370\nAnd here I am on the system that doesn't\nhave a default gateway, all right?\n\n170\n00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.050\nSo how's that going to affect me?\n\n171\n00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:43.430\nIt's gonna affect me when I'm\nreaching out to other hosts.\n\n172\n00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:49.460\nNow when we have a server and somebody\ncalls in and says, hey, I can't I can't\n\n173\n00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.770\nget to the Internet or I can't do updates\nor whatever, we need to troubleshoot that.\n\n174\n00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.610\nAnd there's a handful of\ntools that all help with\n\n175\n00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.300\ntroubleshooting to find\nout why that's a problem.\n\n176\n00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.509\nAnd one of the most useful tools that\nwe're gonna have is a utility called\n\n177\n00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:04.415\nping, right?\n\n178\n00:09:04.415 --> 00:09:08.372\nWhat ping does is it sends out echo\nrequests, it sends out a message.\n\n179\n00:09:08.372 --> 00:09:11.030\nLike I could say, hey,\nWes, do you hear me?\n\n180\n00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.770\nAnd then, Wes could respond and\nsay, yes, I hear you, right?\n\n181\n00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.965\nI send an echo request,\nhe sends an echo reply.\n\n182\n00:09:16.965 --> 00:09:20.429\nAnd the reason they call it an echo is\nI'm gonna send a string of text and\n\n183\n00:09:20.429 --> 00:09:23.631\nI'm expecting the other end to\nsend that same string back to me.\n\n184\n00:09:23.631 --> 00:09:26.630\nSo that we can use that information\nto gauge all sorts of things.\n\n185\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.520\nHow long did it take the message\nto get there and back again?\n\n186\n00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.200\nDid the message get there\nin the first place?\n\n187\n00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.810\nAnd we find out all sorts of\ngood stuff right here in our\n\n188\n00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.840\ntrusty old command prompt.\n\n189\n00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.880\nNow our default command prompt on\nthis server is near microscopic.\n\n190\n00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.040\nSo I'm gonna bump this thing\nup to a little bit bigger so\n\n191\n00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.300\nwe'll be able to see it.\n\n192\n00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:48.479\nAnd then from here, I'm gonna use\nthe Ping utility to troubleshoot this.\n\n193\n00:09:48.479 --> 00:09:52.771\nIf I had a device where we\ncouldn't get out to the network,\n\n194\n00:09:52.771 --> 00:09:58.036\nmaybe I'm on this computer,\nI need to download some drivers from HPE.\n\n195\n00:09:58.036 --> 00:10:02.420\nSo I'm trying to go to www.hpe.com,\nand I'm not getting there.\n\n196\n00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.796\nWell, I could drop to a command prompt,\nand I can try and\n\n197\n00:10:06.796 --> 00:10:10.068\nping www.hpe.com, and see what I get.\n\n198\n00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:14.793\nWell, I get ping request could\nnot find host www.hpe.com.\n\n199\n00:10:14.793 --> 00:10:16.585\nPlease check the name and try again.\n\n200\n00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:19.167\nCouldn't find the host.\n\n201\n00:10:19.167 --> 00:10:20.628\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n202\n00:10:20.628 --> 00:10:25.040\nWell, that means It couldn't do a DNS\nlookup, it couldn't do a name lookup.\n\n203\n00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.252\nIt couldn't resolve that name to an IP.\n\n204\n00:10:28.252 --> 00:10:31.601\nWhen we reach out to a host by name,\nthe computer doesn't need a name.\n\n205\n00:10:31.601 --> 00:10:35.290\nThe computer needs an IP and\nit wasn't able to figure that out.\n\n206\n00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:39.030\nSo I might immediately think, oo,\nI've got a DNS problem, right?\n\n207\n00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:43.270\nNow I know because I removed the default\ngateway that the problem is that I can't\n\n208\n00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:46.440\nget out to the Internet.\n\n209\n00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.420\nWell, if I'm using Internet based DNS\nservers, I can't get to them either.\n\n210\n00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.192\nSo yes, I have a DNS problem,\nbut that's a symptom.\n\n211\n00:10:53.192 --> 00:10:54.536\nNot a cause.\n\n212\n00:10:54.536 --> 00:10:55.763\nDNS servers are fine.\n\n213\n00:10:55.763 --> 00:10:58.045\nIf I go on and\nverify my network configuration and so on.\n\n214\n00:10:58.045 --> 00:11:01.962\nSo, what we really need to do here\nis take a standardized approach to\n\n215\n00:11:01.962 --> 00:11:03.810\ntroubleshooting this.\n\n216\n00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.790\nAnd what I was told people I like to do,\n\n217\n00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.610\nis I like to do is called\npinging from the inside out.\n\n218\n00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:14.179\nI need to understand the path that I\nfollow to figure out where the failure is.\n\n219\n00:11:14.179 --> 00:11:17.571\nThe failure could be right\nhere on my own machine.\n\n220\n00:11:17.571 --> 00:11:22.228\nOr the failure could be on any one\nof the number routers that sit in\n\n221\n00:11:22.228 --> 00:11:23.704\nbetween me and hpe.\n\n222\n00:11:23.704 --> 00:11:26.232\nOr the failure could be at hpe.\n\n223\n00:11:26.232 --> 00:11:27.641\nOr the failure could be on the DNS server.\n\n224\n00:11:27.641 --> 00:11:29.048\nIt could be in any of these places.\n\n225\n00:11:29.048 --> 00:11:31.010\nSo where do we start looking?\n\n226\n00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.210\nWell, in the olden days,\n\n227\n00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:37.310\nI used to always just immediately\ngo to the traceroute utility.\n\n228\n00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:41.630\nThe traceroute utility lets you see\nthe path from you to a destination.\n\n229\n00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.274\nAnd you see every hop in between,\nand wherever it stops,\n\n230\n00:11:44.274 --> 00:11:45.770\nthat's where your problem is.\n\n231\n00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:47.114\nEasy enough.\n\n232\n00:11:47.114 --> 00:11:50.720\nBut more and more, we're seeing people\nblock traceroute with their firewalls.\n\n233\n00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.710\nSo traceroute doesn't always work.\n\n234\n00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.123\nAnd in my scenario,\nwhere I can't even find the host,\n\n235\n00:11:55.123 --> 00:11:57.890\nI'm not sure that it's\ngonna get very far at all.\n\n236\n00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:02.097\nIf I do a traceroute which on a Linux\nsystem I would type traceroute just\n\n237\n00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:02.822\nlike this.\n\n238\n00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:05.915\nOn a Windows system, it's tracert.\n\n239\n00:12:05.915 --> 00:12:09.350\nSame command, just Microsoft chose to\nabbreviate it for whatever reason.\n\n240\n00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:14.491\nSo I'll do a traceroute to www.hpe.com.\n\n241\n00:12:14.491 --> 00:12:18.203\nI wanna see all the stuff\nin between me and HP.\n\n242\n00:12:18.203 --> 00:12:19.640\nWell, what do I get?\n\n243\n00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.650\nUnable to resolve the target system.\n\n244\n00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.450\nI can't get it.\n\n245\n00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.120\nWell, it's unable to resolve,\n\n246\n00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.520\nat least this one's giving me a better\nhint than what I saw up here.\n\n247\n00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.590\nIt can't figure out the IP address.\n\n248\n00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.897\nWell, nslookup is a utility we can use\nto figure out whether we're able to look\n\n249\n00:12:33.897 --> 00:12:34.429\nthat up.\n\n250\n00:12:34.429 --> 00:12:38.202\nIf I do www.nslcup www.hpe.com,\n\n251\n00:12:38.202 --> 00:12:42.227\nI can run that and see if I get an answer.\n\n252\n00:12:42.227 --> 00:12:47.202\nAll right, now the nice thing\nabout NS lookup is that it will\n\n253\n00:12:47.202 --> 00:12:50.397\nallow me to overwrite the DNL server.\n\n254\n00:12:50.397 --> 00:12:54.237\nSo if I think my DNS server is\nthe problem, I can try a different one.\n\n255\n00:12:54.237 --> 00:12:59.223\nHey, I tried 8.8.8.8,\nwhich is one of Google's DNS servers,\n\n256\n00:12:59.223 --> 00:13:01.309\nand it didn't work, right?\n\n257\n00:13:01.309 --> 00:13:05.928\nI could try it again and\nadd 4.2.2.1 at the end.\n\n258\n00:13:05.928 --> 00:13:08.136\nThat's one of Level 3's DNS servers.\n\n259\n00:13:08.136 --> 00:13:11.071\nI like to choose big companies cuz I\nknow their DNS servers are gonna be\n\n260\n00:13:11.071 --> 00:13:11.840\nonline, right?\n\n261\n00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.270\nSo I'm gonna pick Level 3.\n\n262\n00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.610\nAnd I'll run against that one, same thing.\n\n263\n00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:21.487\nNow what are the odds of Google and Level\n3 both having a DNS outage right now?\n\n264\n00:13:21.487 --> 00:13:23.247\nIt's pretty unlikely.\n\n265\n00:13:23.247 --> 00:13:26.943\nSo the fact that I can't get to two of\nthem is making me think that I've probably\n\n266\n00:13:26.943 --> 00:13:29.082\ngot some kind of Internet\nconnection issue.\n\n267\n00:13:29.082 --> 00:13:31.870\nOr some issue that's more\nthan likely my problem.\n\n268\n00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.220\nCuz I doubt there's gonna\nbe an outtage this big.\n\n269\n00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.910\nIt could be that I only have one ISP and\nthe ISP is down right now.\n\n270\n00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.600\nThat could be it.\nSo it's not my fault, but\n\n271\n00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.870\nit's still in my pathway.\n\n272\n00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:42.970\nAnd traceroute isn't helping me.\n\n273\n00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:48.102\nSo this is where we need to start\nthinking about from the inside out.\n\n274\n00:13:48.102 --> 00:13:49.243\nWhere's the problem?\n\n275\n00:13:49.243 --> 00:13:51.250\nI'm gonna start right here on this server.\n\n276\n00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:57.080\nOn this server, I can do a IP config\nto figure out what my address is.\n\n277\n00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.045\nWhat is my address?\n\n278\n00:13:59.045 --> 00:14:02.920\nAnd let's make sure we tackle this from\nthe Windows and the Linux perspective.\n\n279\n00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.740\nBecause the exam covers both, right?\n\n280\n00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.130\nNot through most of the series but\nfor this particular objective they do.\n\n281\n00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:13.290\nSo in Windows,\nI used nslookup to test the nameserver.\n\n282\n00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.247\nWell, on a Linux machine,\nI can do the same thing.\n\n283\n00:14:16.247 --> 00:14:19.884\nSo here I've got a Red Hat system,\nand let me get into this.\n\n284\n00:14:19.884 --> 00:14:21.760\nThis is a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server.\n\n285\n00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:28.210\nAnd almost every Linux system\nhas the NS Lookup utility.\n\n286\n00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.250\nSo once I get in here,\nI can fire up my terminal.\n\n287\n00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.110\nWhether you've got the GUI or\nnot, I've got the GUI on mine.\n\n288\n00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.110\nBut even on a command shell,\nyou'll normally have it.\n\n289\n00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.815\nIf you don't, you can install it\nas part of the IP Tools package.\n\n290\n00:14:38.815 --> 00:14:40.435\nIt's just easy to get it installed.\n\n291\n00:14:40.435 --> 00:14:44.530\nBut I could do that same thing where I\ndo an MS lookup for www.hpe.com, and\n\n292\n00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.060\nit'll look it up.\n\n293\n00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:50.020\nNow this server doesn't have a problem,\nso the lookup completes successfully.\n\n294\n00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.580\nBut I can even override that server\nlike I showed you a moment ago.\n\n295\n00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.920\nAnd now we look up against\nthe other server and\n\n296\n00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.600\nI'm able to pull that information.\n\n297\n00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.800\nSo same troubleshooting.\n\n298\n00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.450\nWhere things get different through,\nis in Windows,\n\n299\n00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.270\nif I wanna see what my IP Address is,\nI run IP Config.\n\n300\n00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.792\nThat utility's been around forever.\n\n301\n00:15:05.792 --> 00:15:10.251\nAnd I can see here's my IP address,\n10.0.222.223.\n\n302\n00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:14.336\nIn the Linux world, there's actually\ntwo different commands we can use.\n\n303\n00:15:14.336 --> 00:15:19.648\nThe old command, the one's that\nbeen around forever is IFconfig.\n\n304\n00:15:19.648 --> 00:15:22.805\nSo on Windows we had IP config,\nhere's it IFconfig.\n\n305\n00:15:22.805 --> 00:15:26.731\nUnder Windows, it's the Internet\nProtocol Configuration Utility.\n\n306\n00:15:26.731 --> 00:15:31.435\nHere it's the interface\nconfiguration utility so ifconfig.\n\n307\n00:15:31.435 --> 00:15:35.655\nAnd when you run ifconfig, you'll see all\nof the interfaces on your system, and\n\n308\n00:15:35.655 --> 00:15:37.963\nif you've got an IP address you'll see it.\n\n309\n00:15:37.963 --> 00:15:41.511\nSo I can see right here this interface\nmy eno, it's a virtual adaptor so\n\n310\n00:15:41.511 --> 00:15:43.534\nit's got a large number assigned to it.\n\n311\n00:15:43.534 --> 00:15:48.164\nThat it has an IP address of 10.0.14.240.\n\n312\n00:15:48.164 --> 00:15:50.196\nSo I can find my own IP address.\n\n313\n00:15:50.196 --> 00:15:53.150\nNow, this command is being deprecated.\n\n314\n00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:58.018\nThere's actually a few systems,\nlike some of the newer Fedoras and stuff,\n\n315\n00:15:58.018 --> 00:16:01.987\nwhere they're not supporting\nifconfig by default anymore.\n\n316\n00:16:01.987 --> 00:16:04.340\nIf you do a minimal install,\nifconfig is not there.\n\n317\n00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:08.372\nSo you need to use the new command,\nwhich is ip addr.\n\n318\n00:16:08.372 --> 00:16:12.293\nThere's an ip command that has all sorts\nof IP configuration stuff inside of it,\n\n319\n00:16:12.293 --> 00:16:13.456\nand addr is one of them.\n\n320\n00:16:13.456 --> 00:16:15.440\nIt will show me what my address is.\n\n321\n00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.826\nAnd I can come in, and I can look.\n\n322\n00:16:16.826 --> 00:16:19.500\nNow, under Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n7 you have both commands, so\n\n323\n00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.110\nyou can learn either one.\n\n324\n00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:22.720\nI go back and forth.\n\n325\n00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.990\nI still use ifconfig, just cuz it's kind\nof ingrained in me from all these years,\n\n326\n00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.480\nbut ip addr is the new one.\n\n327\n00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.140\nAnd that's coming from the BSD world,\n\n328\n00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.450\nso a lot of the BSD-based operating\nsystems were already moved to it.\n\n329\n00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:35.221\nLinux is following suit.\n\n330\n00:16:35.221 --> 00:16:38.480\nAll right, but either way, I can figure\nout what my IP address is, here it is.\n\n331\n00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.210\nAnd then we can start to test.\n\n332\n00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.770\nNow when we test, we're typically\ngonna use the ping utility.\n\n333\n00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:48.880\nAnd with ping, you can specify your\ndestination by IP, or by name.\n\n334\n00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.436\nNow I'm having DNS issues here,\nso I'm not gonna use names.\n\n335\n00:16:52.436 --> 00:16:55.520\nBut I'm gonna start by pinging myself.\n\n336\n00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.092\nAnd the first thing I like\nto do is ping 127.0.0.1.\n\n337\n00:16:59.092 --> 00:17:02.432\nThat's pinging the loopback\ninterface on your system.\n\n338\n00:17:02.432 --> 00:17:07.200\nBy pinging the loopback, it's not testing\nyour hardware, it's testing your software.\n\n339\n00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.250\nIs the TCP/IP protocol\nstack running properly?\n\n340\n00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.580\nIf it is, you'll get replies.\n\n341\n00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.350\nIf it isn't, it'll fail, right?\n\n342\n00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.560\nSo we wanna make sure that we test that.\n\n343\n00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.490\nNow, on Windows,\nit sends four pings and stops.\n\n344\n00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.770\nIn the Linux world, really the UNIX\nworld as a whole, if I do a ping,\n\n345\n00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:31.410\nto an IP, it continues running\nthe ping until I tell it to stop.\n\n346\n00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.966\nSo it's just gonna keep pinging over, and\n\n347\n00:17:32.966 --> 00:17:34.617\nover, and\nover again until I tell it to stop.\n\n348\n00:17:34.617 --> 00:17:39.270\nAnd I can hit Ctrl+C whenever I'm ready,\nand that'll stop it, okay?\n\n349\n00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:42.273\nYou could do a -n and specify a number\nof times you want it to run, but\n\n350\n00:17:42.273 --> 00:17:44.085\nthe default is to just continually run.\n\n351\n00:17:44.085 --> 00:17:45.490\nNow, that's useful.\n\n352\n00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.600\nFor example, I might think that\nI have a bad cable, and so\n\n353\n00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.770\nI wanna go swap the cable and\nsee if it works.\n\n354\n00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:54.201\nSo I might do a ping under Windows and\nadd a -t.\n\n355\n00:17:54.201 --> 00:17:57.030\n-t says, keep pinging and don't stop.\n\n356\n00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.101\nAnd now I can go and\nI change out the cable and just see.\n\n357\n00:18:00.101 --> 00:18:01.696\nDid the pings all of a sudden start?\n\n358\n00:18:01.696 --> 00:18:03.638\nRight, you can watch for\nthat and see if it picks up.\n\n359\n00:18:05.995 --> 00:18:09.790\nAll right I can ping 127.0.0.1, great.\n\n360\n00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.820\nSo it looks like my software is okay.\n\n361\n00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:16.395\nIf you're on an IPv6 network,\ninstead of 127.0.0.1,\n\n362\n00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:21.639\nyou would ping the address 1,\nwhich in IPv6 can be abbreviated to ::1.\n\n363\n00:18:21.639 --> 00:18:25.913\nSo when I ping ::1,\nthat's pinging my own IPv6 address.\n\n364\n00:18:25.913 --> 00:18:27.467\nAnd so it's gonna hit that and verify it.\n\n365\n00:18:27.467 --> 00:18:30.196\nSo IPv6, IPv4,\nreally kinda treated the same here.\n\n366\n00:18:32.136 --> 00:18:36.310\nAll right, then I'm gonna ping the IP\naddress that's assigned to me.\n\n367\n00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:40.688\nMy machine is 10.0.222.223.\n\n368\n00:18:40.688 --> 00:18:43.578\nI'm gonna ping myself.\n\n369\n00:18:43.578 --> 00:18:45.800\nNow, why would I ping my own IP?\n\n370\n00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.618\nIf I unplug my network adapter,\nmy network link goes down and\n\n371\n00:18:50.618 --> 00:18:53.760\nI won't answer to this IP any more.\n\n372\n00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.837\nBut if I plug the adapter in and\nI get a link light,\n\n373\n00:18:55.837 --> 00:18:58.398\nas long as I have a link light I\nshould get a response to this.\n\n374\n00:18:58.398 --> 00:18:59.956\nSo this is a great way just to check and\n\n375\n00:18:59.956 --> 00:19:01.980\nsee whether your physical media is up,\nright?\n\n376\n00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.770\nIf I've got a link light,\nthis ping should respond.\n\n377\n00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.870\nNow, just having a link light doesn't mean\nwe're actually connected to anything.\n\n378\n00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:11.331\nI used to make these little loopback plugs\nyou could pop into an adaptor just for\n\n379\n00:19:11.331 --> 00:19:14.333\ntesting, and it would just have\nthe wires cross right back into it.\n\n380\n00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:16.308\nAnd you could plug those in\nto bring a link light up.\n\n381\n00:19:16.308 --> 00:19:17.990\nIt'll make this respond.\n\n382\n00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.810\nBut it's a way to test and\njust verify that.\n\n383\n00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:22.920\nBecause If the server is 100 miles away\n\n384\n00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.900\nI can't necessarily see\nif there is a link light.\n\n385\n00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.705\nAnd Windows is probably gonna tell me, or\n\n386\n00:19:26.705 --> 00:19:29.088\nLinux is probably gonna tell\nme if the interface is up.\n\n387\n00:19:29.088 --> 00:19:30.422\nBut this is a quick way to test it and\n\n388\n00:19:30.422 --> 00:19:33.140\nnot have to mess around with trying\nto hunt down other verifications.\n\n389\n00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:38.970\nAll right, then I need to ping\nsomebody else on my network.\n\n390\n00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.190\nAnd you can pick any other\nhost that's on your network.\n\n391\n00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.878\nBe careful, cuz a lot of hosts\nare gonna have firewalls up and\n\n392\n00:19:43.878 --> 00:19:45.209\nthey're gonna block pings.\n\n393\n00:19:45.209 --> 00:19:47.177\nLike if Wes told me the IP of his laptop,\n\n394\n00:19:47.177 --> 00:19:50.350\nI might not be able to ping his\nlaptop if he's got a firewall on.\n\n395\n00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:55.040\nSo I usually pick something like a network\nattached printer or a file server.\n\n396\n00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.834\nSomething that I know is going to\nrespond to pings, or even better,\n\n397\n00:19:58.834 --> 00:20:00.776\nwhoever your default gateway is.\n\n398\n00:20:00.776 --> 00:20:02.364\nRemember, if you're gonna\ngo out to the Internet,\n\n399\n00:20:02.364 --> 00:20:04.220\nyou gotta cross through\nyour default gateway.\n\n400\n00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.516\nAnd the default gateway has to\nbe on the same network as you.\n\n401\n00:20:07.516 --> 00:20:08.560\nIf it was on a different network,\n\n402\n00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.500\nyou would have to go through\na gateway to get to your gateway and\n\n403\n00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.090\nthat doesn't make any sense, right?\n\n404\n00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.610\nSo the default gateway's\na great candidate to ping.\n\n405\n00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:20.539\nAnd my default gateway is\nsupposed to be 10.0.0.1.\n\n406\n00:20:20.539 --> 00:20:24.213\nSo if I try and ping that,\ncan I get to it?\n\n407\n00:20:24.213 --> 00:20:26.461\nMy IP is 10.0.222.223,\n\n408\n00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:30.898\n10.0.0.1 is on the same network as me,\nI should be able to ping it.\n\n409\n00:20:30.898 --> 00:20:32.240\nAnd I can, right?\n\n410\n00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:36.438\nSo I now know that local\ncommunications are fine.\n\n411\n00:20:36.438 --> 00:20:41.090\nNow I need to pick somebody out\non the Internet, somebody remote.\n\n412\n00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:45.690\nAnd in an ideal world I try and\npick the default gateway for\n\n413\n00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.930\nmy Internet Service Provider, right?\n\n414\n00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.525\nI'm going to a firewall.\n\n415\n00:20:49.525 --> 00:20:52.135\nAnd that firewall is connecting to,\nin our case,\n\n416\n00:20:52.135 --> 00:20:55.835\nto a metro Ethernet line that runs\nto our provider, a fiber link.\n\n417\n00:20:55.835 --> 00:21:00.135\nAnd on that fiber link there's a default\ngateway that is our telco provider,\n\n418\n00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:01.950\nthe people who are providing our line.\n\n419\n00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.617\nAnd so ideally, I would ping that.\n\n420\n00:21:03.617 --> 00:21:06.289\nWhen you start pinging out to\nthe Internet, you got tons of hops,\n\n421\n00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:08.387\nlots of different people\nin between you and there.\n\n422\n00:21:08.387 --> 00:21:11.319\nBut when you ping your own ISP,\nit's usually just one hop away,\n\n423\n00:21:11.319 --> 00:21:12.630\nright across that link.\n\n424\n00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:16.450\nGreat way to test that out and\ntake the Internet out of the picture.\n\n425\n00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:18.074\nSo I'm gonna ping that gateway.\n\n426\n00:21:18.074 --> 00:21:19.950\nNow, I have to try and\nremember what it is.\n\n427\n00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:26.018\nI believe it is 209.251.133.97.\n\n428\n00:21:26.018 --> 00:21:27.574\nIt's 96 or 97.\n\n429\n00:21:27.574 --> 00:21:28.761\nShoot, I think it's 97.\n\n430\n00:21:28.761 --> 00:21:33.430\nSo I'm gonna try and\nping to the gateway of our ISP, all right?\n\n431\n00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.620\nAnd if I can get there, great.\n\n432\n00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.980\nIf I can't get there,\nnow I think maybe my ISP is down.\n\n433\n00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.534\nOr maybe my fire wall is acting up.\n\n434\n00:21:42.534 --> 00:21:45.048\nNow I start to have an idea of\nwhere that problem might be.\n\n435\n00:21:45.048 --> 00:21:47.425\nNow, I got a PING: transmit failed.\n\n436\n00:21:47.425 --> 00:21:48.830\nGeneral Failure.\n\n437\n00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:50.640\nThat's an odd error.\n\n438\n00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.320\nNot a host not found.\n\n439\n00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.030\nNot a destination unreachable.\n\n440\n00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.143\nI got a transmit failed.\n\n441\n00:21:57.143 --> 00:22:01.070\nNow, some of the errors that you get,\nall right?\n\n442\n00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.221\nDestination host not found, right?\n\n443\n00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:07.010\nThat's usually, we couldn't do a name\nlookup to convert to an IP, right?\n\n444\n00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:12.000\nIf you get host unreachable,\nthat means you tried to reach out, but\n\n445\n00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.320\nsomebody down the road told\nyou they couldn't get there.\n\n446\n00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.480\nThat happens a lot.\n\n447\n00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.960\nYou'll reach out,\nyou'll cross through five or six routers.\n\n448\n00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.916\nAnd a router downstream will send\na message back saying no, I'm sorry,\n\n449\n00:22:21.916 --> 00:22:23.571\nI can't get there, host unreachable.\n\n450\n00:22:23.571 --> 00:22:26.360\nThey don't tell us why,\njust they couldn't get there.\n\n451\n00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.740\nAnd so we have to trust that, and\n\n452\n00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.850\nwe receive it back,\nyou get a host unreachable.\n\n453\n00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:34.120\nYou might get a no route to\nhost in your routing table.\n\n454\n00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.094\nYou maintain a routing table on your\nservers, even though they're not routers.\n\n455\n00:22:37.094 --> 00:22:38.593\nThey route their own traffic.\n\n456\n00:22:38.593 --> 00:22:39.804\nThey have a routing table, and\n\n457\n00:22:39.804 --> 00:22:43.760\nif there's no route to be able to get\nto that destination, you can get that.\n\n458\n00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.330\nOr you can get something like this,\ntransmit failed.\n\n459\n00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:47.340\nGeneral Failure.\n\n460\n00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.991\nThe general failure,\nin this case, is general.\n\n461\n00:22:49.991 --> 00:22:50.769\nThey're not helping me out here.\n\n462\n00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:52.630\nThey're not giving me a specific error.\n\n463\n00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:57.060\nBut usually when you see this it's\nindicating that we didn't have a route.\n\n464\n00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.510\nWe didn't have a way to get there.\n\n465\n00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.640\nIf we don't have a way to get there,\nping can't work.\n\n466\n00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.880\nPing can't work to do it's job if\nit doesn't have a way to get there.\n\n467\n00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.410\nNow, that routing table.\n\n468\n00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.064\nHow do we see that?\n\n469\n00:23:09.064 --> 00:23:12.980\nWell, in the Windows world you got a nice\nlittle command, which is route print.\n\n470\n00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.363\nAnd the route print command will\nshow you your routing table.\n\n471\n00:23:16.363 --> 00:23:19.891\nAnd it'll have IPv4 and IPv6,\nand you can look at it.\n\n472\n00:23:19.891 --> 00:23:24.515\nAnd I can say, all right,\nif I'm gonna reach out to 209.251.133.97,\n\n473\n00:23:24.515 --> 00:23:26.750\nwhich route am I gonna take?\n\n474\n00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.860\nAm I gonna take this route of\na destination of 10 dot whatever?\n\n475\n00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.750\nNo, it starts at 209.\n\n476\n00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:35.257\nDoesn't match this one, doesn't match this\none, you can go down the line looking for\n\n477\n00:23:35.257 --> 00:23:36.134\na match, all right?\n\n478\n00:23:36.134 --> 00:23:38.054\nWhat you're going to see is a route for\n\n479\n00:23:38.054 --> 00:23:40.700\nevery network that you're\ndirectly plugged into.\n\n480\n00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.846\nSo for me it's the 10.0 network.\n\n481\n00:23:42.846 --> 00:23:45.731\nYou're going to see routes for\nyour individual IPs,\n\n482\n00:23:45.731 --> 00:23:49.460\nas well as the broadcasts for\nthe subnets that you're plugged into.\n\n483\n00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.820\nYou're gonna see routes for\nthe loopback networks.\n\n484\n00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.105\nYou're going to see routes for the multi\nnetworks if you've done any kind of\n\n485\n00:23:56.105 --> 00:23:58.970\nmulticast activity, which most people are.\n\n486\n00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:02.287\nAnd then lastly you're going to see\nroutes for the overall broadcast,\n\n487\n00:24:02.287 --> 00:24:06.335\nthe ones that the layer two communications\nuse, because they don't have IPs use yet.\n\n488\n00:24:06.335 --> 00:24:08.567\nYou're going to see routes for those, but\n\n489\n00:24:08.567 --> 00:24:12.430\nthe very first route will\ntypically be your default gateway.\n\n490\n00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:17.380\nI remove my default gateway so\nit doesn't show up here in the list.\n\n491\n00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.130\nSo when I try and ping 209.251.133.\n\n492\n00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:23.190\nwhatever It comes down this list and\nthat network doesn't match any of this.\n\n493\n00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:27.510\nI've got no route,\nI can't get to where I'm going.\n\n494\n00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.840\nThe route print command is\na pretty handy way to see that.\n\n495\n00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:33.490\nIt's even more useful when you\nhave multiple network adapters.\n\n496\n00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:34.600\nWhat if I have two network adapters?\n\n497\n00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.420\nI could have two default gateways.\n\n498\n00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:36.950\nNo, you can't.\n\n499\n00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:40.356\nYou can only have one default gateway.\n\n500\n00:24:40.356 --> 00:24:42.590\nIt's the default.\nYou can only have one default.\n\n501\n00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.310\nWell, what if you have two though?\n\n502\n00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.550\nThe system will pick one.\n\n503\n00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.160\nIt'll pick one and it'll use it.\n\n504\n00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.930\nNotice how each of these\nadapters has a metric, or\n\n505\n00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:52.770\neach of these routes has a metric.\n\n506\n00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:54.750\nOne will be preferred over the other.\n\n507\n00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:57.950\nIf you have two network adapters and\none's work adapter number one and\n\n508\n00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.230\nthe other's number two at\na minimum it can use that.\n\n509\n00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.500\nIt can use the number of the adapter to\ndetermine which one's gonna be preferred.\n\n510\n00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.880\nBut it's gonna pick one unless you're\nleveraging something like nick\n\n511\n00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.500\nteaming where you bond\nthe networks together.\n\n512\n00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:14.250\nAnd in that scenario it creates a virtual\nadapter and you have one default gateway.\n\n513\n00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.820\nIt just happens to be reachable\nvia both network cards.\n\n514\n00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.270\nAll right, so you can have that scenario.\n\n515\n00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:20.130\nBut it is tied to an interface and\na network and\n\n516\n00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:21.450\nthat's how it's gonna\nprefer one over another.\n\n517\n00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.810\nNow in Windows,\nI can use Route Print for that.\n\n518\n00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:30.000\nIn the Linux world,\nwe can use the netstack command.\n\n519\n00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.840\nNow the netstack command is useful for\na lot of other things.\n\n520\n00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.140\nSo we're gonna talk about\nnetstack more later on.\n\n521\n00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.190\nBut it lets us see our routing table also.\n\n522\n00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:41.530\nIf you do a netstack-r,\nit'll bring up your routing table.\n\n523\n00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:45.330\nUnder the Linux world, there used\nto be a route command a ctually,\n\n524\n00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:48.230\nI don't even know if it's still there,\nlet's see if it still is.\n\n525\n00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.040\nIt's still there, all right,\nwell, there we go.\n\n526\n00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.920\nFor some reason,\nI thought that command was gone.\n\n527\n00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.590\nBut, see what it put out?\n\n528\n00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:55.700\nThe exact same thing as Netstack-r, right?\n\n529\n00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.960\nAnd that might be a Red Hat alias,\nI don't know.\n\n530\n00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.200\nBut for some reason I had it in the back\nof my mind that the route command\n\n531\n00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:00.700\nwas gone.\n\n532\n00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.070\nSo, well there you go.\n\n533\n00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.170\nYou got that command.\n\n534\n00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:06.460\nBut netstat-r that's the one I always\ncount on, cuz I know it's there.\n\n535\n00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.030\nIt's gonna show your routing table.\n\n536\n00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:09.670\nAnd it's just like in the Windows side.\n\n537\n00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:13.440\nI can see that this one does\nhave a default gateway, and\n\n538\n00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.780\nsee how they actually wrote it out?\n\n539\n00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.140\nDefault gateway?\n\n540\n00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.470\nSometimes they do that.\n\n541\n00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.750\nMicrosoft, Cisco, and\nsome of the other vendors,\n\n542\n00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:22.130\nthough, they write it\nout as just four zeros.\n\n543\n00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.990\nIf you see zero, zero, zero,\nzero, that's like a wildcard.\n\n544\n00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:26.500\nThat's the default gateway.\n\n545\n00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.110\nAnd this one is pointing\nto a particular adapter.\n\n546\n00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:32.290\nAnd a particular destination to get there,\nright?\n\n547\n00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:35.560\nAs you look at some of these other\nones like the 10.0.0.0 network,\n\n548\n00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.330\nwell that 10.0.0.0 network,\nwe're directly plugged into,\n\n549\n00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.950\nwe don't need anything\nspecial to get there.\n\n550\n00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.830\nBut apparently I've got an adapter\nunder 192.268.122 network.\n\n551\n00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:45.550\nIt's probably some virtual\nnetwork I'm doing for something.\n\n552\n00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:47.860\nSo it will turn up and\nwe've got a route for that, too.\n\n553\n00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.900\nSo you can look and see if you're missing\na route right here in your settings.\n\n554\n00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:55.670\nNow, I know here in the Windows one\nthat I'm missing my default gateway.\n\n555\n00:26:55.670 --> 00:27:00.220\nIf I'm missing the default gateway,\nI can't do a DNS lookup, can I?\n\n556\n00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.440\nWell, I could have tested,\nway back in the beginning,\n\n557\n00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:06.510\na local DNS server with that nslookup\ncommand that I was running earlier,\n\n558\n00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.570\nwhere I was overriding the mail\nserver I mean a mail server.\n\n559\n00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:10.230\nThe DNS server?\n\n560\n00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:14.350\nI could have specified a local\nserver if you have one lying around,\n\n561\n00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:18.930\ndo I have a DNS server lying\naround on the local network?\n\n562\n00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:20.240\nI feel like I do.\n\n563\n00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.749\nLet's see if I have one at 210.\n\n564\n00:27:21.749 --> 00:27:22.865\nThere we go.\n\n565\n00:27:22.865 --> 00:27:25.585\nSo I can point to a local DNS server and\n\n566\n00:27:25.585 --> 00:27:29.095\nthis is a system center lab that I was\nbuilding, so it's basically connected up.\n\n567\n00:27:29.095 --> 00:27:30.645\nUnable to do the lookup.\n\n568\n00:27:30.645 --> 00:27:33.980\nI was able to do a DNS lookup off\na local server but not a remote.\n\n569\n00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.570\nAnd that would be a great hint to\nlet us know our default gateway\n\n570\n00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:38.740\nis malfunctioning.\n\n571\n00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.730\nIf we fix our default gateway,\nnow we'll have that route.\n\n572\n00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:43.770\nIn my case, I created the error myself.\n\n573\n00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:47.700\nI removed the default gateway, or\nedited it, or changed it, whatever it was.\n\n574\n00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.600\nIn real life land,\n\n575\n00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.620\nit would normally be a matter of maybe\nthe default gateway is IP changed.\n\n576\n00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.590\nMaybe the subnet mask was wrong so\n\n577\n00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.570\nI didn't know I needed to\nuse the default gateway.\n\n578\n00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:59.380\nI thought I was trying to go direct or\nsomething like that.\n\n579\n00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.560\nThose are different areas\nthat might cause the problem.\n\n580\n00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:06.965\nBut more commonly it's just\nsomething wrong in between you and\n\n581\n00:28:06.965 --> 00:28:08.525\nthe default gateway.\n\n582\n00:28:08.525 --> 00:28:10.375\nWhat's in between you and\nthe default gateway?\n\n583\n00:28:10.375 --> 00:28:12.575\nSwitches, network cables, right?\n\n584\n00:28:12.575 --> 00:28:13.965\nThese are things that can fail.\n\n585\n00:28:13.965 --> 00:28:16.255\nOn switches they usually have\nloop protection on them,\n\n586\n00:28:16.255 --> 00:28:18.085\nthings like Spanning Tree Protocol.\n\n587\n00:28:18.085 --> 00:28:22.655\nYour port might be getting blocked\non its way to the gateway.\n\n588\n00:28:22.655 --> 00:28:23.925\nYou might have VLANS.\n\n589\n00:28:23.925 --> 00:28:28.240\nVLANS are virtual local area network\nwhen you take a look at a switch,\n\n590\n00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.370\nlet's say you've got a 24 port switch.\n\n591\n00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:32.420\nThe assumption is if I take\nthat switch out of the box, and\n\n592\n00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.200\nI plug a computer in port 1, and\nI plug another computer in port 24,\n\n593\n00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.600\nthey can talk to each other, right?\n\n594\n00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.266\nEvery port's able to talk to each other,\nand that's how it is normally.\n\n595\n00:28:39.266 --> 00:28:43.600\nBut on Enterprise-grade switches,\nyou can create virtual networks,\n\n596\n00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.120\nyou can subdivide the ports.\n\n597\n00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.940\nAnd it's very, very common.\n\n598\n00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.900\nWe'll take the server and put them in\nthe VLAN, we take the sales people\n\n599\n00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.683\nput on another VLAN, take the marketing\npeople take them on the third VLAN,\n\n600\n00:28:52.683 --> 00:28:54.954\nseparate them out makes\nthe network smaller,\n\n601\n00:28:54.954 --> 00:28:58.930\nminimize the broadcast traffic and\nhelp system to impose security.\n\n602\n00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:00.850\nA security piece is what\nwe have to worry about.\n\n603\n00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:04.840\nAs you pass through your VLAN,\nthere might be access control lists that\n\n604\n00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.670\nare preventing you from getting\nto certain destinations.\n\n605\n00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.860\nIt's not a problem on your server,\nit's a problem on the switches or\n\n606\n00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:13.190\nrouters that are feeding it and\nproviding the routing for the VLANS.\n\n607\n00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.090\nSo we just need to be\nable to identify this so\n\n608\n00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:16.630\nwe can turn it over to the network team.\n\n609\n00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:19.260\nSo they can go and correct it.\n\n610\n00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:22.060\nBut once things are put back in place and\nworking again,\n\n611\n00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:26.555\nnow I should be able to ping www.hpd.com.\n\n612\n00:29:26.555 --> 00:29:27.651\nAnd I am.\n\n613\n00:29:27.651 --> 00:29:32.020\nAnd if I go back to the trace route\ncommand that I started with and\n\n614\n00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:36.530\nI take a look here, now it's mapping\nout the way to get to that destination.\n\n615\n00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:40.280\nLooks like hp's hosting with Akamai or\nat least Akamai's Edge service.\n\n616\n00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.650\nAnd so here we go.\n\n617\n00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:42.970\nI'm exiting the building.\n\n618\n00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:45.270\nThere's my ISP.\n\n619\n00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:47.420\nI got the wrong IP earlier didn't I?\n\n620\n00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:48.100\nI did 133.97, it was 131.\n\n621\n00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:52.750\nI was close, but\nclose is not enough in this business.\n\n622\n00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.150\nBut there I'm hitting my ISP.\n\n623\n00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:57.340\nFrom the ISP, I crossed their network.\n\n624\n00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.640\nOur ISP is GRU,\nthe Gainsel Renew Utilities.\n\n625\n00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.530\nSo there we are in the GRU network.\n\n626\n00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:03.400\nAnd then we jumped up to Atlanta and\n\n627\n00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.310\nin Atlanta they have an internet\nexchange with Akamai.\n\n628\n00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:11.130\nAnd Akamai hand to me right over\nthe HP server just four hops.\n\n629\n00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.990\nNow there could be a problem at any one\nof these four hops that would cause\n\n630\n00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:15.040\nan outage.\n\n631\n00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.784\nIf GRU went down,\nthese first two hops might not work.\n\n632\n00:30:17.784 --> 00:30:20.680\nIf Akamai had a denial service tech or\n\n633\n00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.180\nsomething then I might dial\nout once I get into Atlanta.\n\n634\n00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.360\nBut here I can see where that\ncommunication might run and then stop.\n\n635\n00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:28.970\nSome systems might go through more hops.\n\n636\n00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:34.520\nLike if I try to go to ITPRO.TV,\nto our website right?\n\n637\n00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:38.690\nIt's hosted in a data center that is in,\nif I remember right,\n\n638\n00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:43.110\nNew Jersey of all places, and\nso I'm gonna bounce up and\n\n639\n00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:46.660\nyou'll see me come through\nthe ISP just like before.\n\n640\n00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.870\nAnd jump up to Atlanta just like before.\n\n641\n00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:52.740\nAnd then jump up to Washington D.C.\nand then it dies out.\n\n642\n00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.940\nLots of problem, right?\n\n643\n00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:01.350\nNot necessarily cuz right after that we\nthen hit a cloud proxy, it hit sucuri.net,\n\n644\n00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:04.350\nthat's the web firewall that we\nuse in front of our website and\n\n645\n00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:05.690\nwe got to the website.\n\n646\n00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:09.150\nSo what happened right here at step 5?\n\n647\n00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:15.100\nWhat happened at step five is that we\npassed into the security web firewall.\n\n648\n00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:19.060\nAnd they block pings and\ntracer outs on that system.\n\n649\n00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.845\nSo it wasn't until we got through it that\nwe were then approved to get the response,\n\n650\n00:31:22.845 --> 00:31:26.925\nmany people are blocking that now,\nso expect to see little gaps.\n\n651\n00:31:26.925 --> 00:31:29.170\nAnd the gap is okay as long as\nthere is something after it.\n\n652\n00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:33.181\nBut if you start to see a whole row of\nasterisks, and it just keeps going row\n\n653\n00:31:33.181 --> 00:31:37.776\nafter row after row, that usually means\na firewall has cut off your communication,\n\n654\n00:31:37.776 --> 00:31:41.685\nand that may be the problem with\nyour communications, but not always.\n\n655\n00:31:41.685 --> 00:31:46.416\nIt's not always a guarantee, because as\nyou reach out It could be that they're\n\n656\n00:31:46.416 --> 00:31:50.441\nblocking traceroute, but\nthat they're allowing HTTP and HTTPS,\n\n657\n00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:55.660\nthat if you were to browse with a regular\nweb protocol, you'd get there just fine.\n\n658\n00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:59.120\nSo you've always gotta troubleshoot\nusing more than one tool, if you can.\n\n659\n00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:03.167\nNow, I was hoping to find somebody\nwith more, more hops than that,\n\n660\n00:32:03.167 --> 00:32:07.303\nlet's try somebody like slashdot,\nsomebody who's not on Akamai.\n\n661\n00:32:07.303 --> 00:32:10.794\n[LAUGH] Akamai, their whole business\nmodel is that they have servers all over\n\n662\n00:32:10.794 --> 00:32:14.608\nthe world, so you always get them really\nquickly, you just jump right to them, and\n\n663\n00:32:14.608 --> 00:32:17.633\nit's not as exciting, but\nhere's one that's at least six ops.\n\n664\n00:32:17.633 --> 00:32:19.293\n&gt;&gt; Don, is that a commonality?\n\n665\n00:32:19.293 --> 00:32:22.092\nLike when you're troubleshooting\nrather than just rely\n\n666\n00:32:22.092 --> 00:32:25.997\non the results from one location, like\nyou're doing right here in this episode\n\n667\n00:32:25.997 --> 00:32:30.522\nwhere you're using multiple locations,\nis that something that you commonly do?\n\n668\n00:32:30.522 --> 00:32:31.038\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\nYeah,\n\n669\n00:32:31.038 --> 00:32:35.140\nyou've got to get different perspectives,\nright, different ways of looking at\n\n670\n00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:39.003\nan outage, because there might be\na situation where something looks down but\n\n671\n00:32:39.003 --> 00:32:40.710\nactually isn't, right?\n\n672\n00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.923\nThat’s where you have websites\nlike what is it, down for me,\n\n673\n00:32:44.923 --> 00:32:48.012\nis it down for just me,\nwhat is that website?\n\n674\n00:32:48.012 --> 00:32:48.914\nHere we go, Down for Everyone.\n\n675\n00:32:48.914 --> 00:32:52.207\nThere's this website called Down for\nEveryone and you can come in and\n\n676\n00:32:52.207 --> 00:32:55.120\nyou can punch a site,\nI can say like, is itpro.tv down?\n\n677\n00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:59.571\nMaybe I'm trying to get to itpro.tv and\nI can't get to it, so I come in here and\n\n678\n00:32:59.571 --> 00:33:02.749\nI punch that in, and I run it and\nit's just you, right?\n\n679\n00:33:02.749 --> 00:33:04.542\nThe site is up, you've got the problem,\n\n680\n00:33:04.542 --> 00:33:07.723\nsometimes you need to see something\nfrom somebody else's perspective,\n\n681\n00:33:07.723 --> 00:33:11.540\nbecause I might say, those ITProTV guys,\ntheir website's down again, so lame.\n\n682\n00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:15.803\nBut then I come here and look, and\nthe rest of the world's getting there\n\n683\n00:33:15.803 --> 00:33:19.729\njust fine, I've got a problem,\nor the Internet health report.\n\n684\n00:33:19.729 --> 00:33:24.816\nIf you've never seen the Internet\nhealth report, for Internet issues is\n\n685\n00:33:24.816 --> 00:33:29.757\njust a really neat thing, shoot,\nthat's the wrong one, this one.\n\n686\n00:33:29.757 --> 00:33:31.950\nThe Internet is made up\nof a series of backbones,\n\n687\n00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:34.195\nthere's these huge Telco\nproviders out there and\n\n688\n00:33:34.195 --> 00:33:37.954\nthey've connected their networks together\nand that's what makes the Internet.\n\n689\n00:33:37.954 --> 00:33:42.434\nAnd so these are some of the main ones\nthat are out there, Cogent, Level3,\n\n690\n00:33:42.434 --> 00:33:46.290\nSavvis, SBC, Sprint,\nVerizon, XO, CenturyLink.\n\n691\n00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:49.902\nThese guys are really\nwhat powers the Internet,\n\n692\n00:33:49.902 --> 00:33:54.747\nwhen they connect to each other,\nsometimes they have problems,\n\n693\n00:33:54.747 --> 00:33:59.767\nif you look, most of these networks\nare perfectly fine, but here,\n\n694\n00:33:59.767 --> 00:34:04.465\nCogent connecting to Level3,\nit's red, what's going on?\n\n695\n00:34:04.465 --> 00:34:08.628\nWell, 6.25% packet loss,\nthat doesn't sound like a lot, 6%,\n\n696\n00:34:08.628 --> 00:34:13.134\nbut in network communications if you're\nlosing six out of a hundred packets,\n\n697\n00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:14.930\nthat's a lot of retransmits.\n\n698\n00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:18.361\nThat's gonna make that network slower,\nand it looks like Level3 is having some\n\n699\n00:34:18.361 --> 00:34:21.490\nproblems across the board,\n25% packet loss from Level3 to Level3,\n\n700\n00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:24.583\nthat's a pretty good indicator\nthey're having some internal issues.\n\n701\n00:34:24.583 --> 00:34:29.918\nI get 25% between Sprint and Level3,\nso there's something going on there,\n\n702\n00:34:29.918 --> 00:34:35.647\nif I'm trying to contact an Internet host,\nand I'm crossing from Level3 to Savvis,\n\n703\n00:34:35.647 --> 00:34:40.970\nor something like that, I'm going to\nsee symptoms of that connectivity.\n\n704\n00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:43.812\nThat's not my problem,\nit's not the destination's problem,\n\n705\n00:34:43.812 --> 00:34:47.375\nit's a problem in between, that's\nsomething we've always got to think about,\n\n706\n00:34:47.375 --> 00:34:50.527\nand where it's beneficial to look at\nit from more than one perspective,\n\n707\n00:34:50.527 --> 00:34:53.831\nI might be coming from Savvis and you\nmight be on Verizon, so you might be able\n\n708\n00:34:53.831 --> 00:34:57.739\nto get there and I can't, and it's because\nwe're going through different providers.\n\n709\n00:34:57.739 --> 00:35:00.481\nIt's always nice to see,\nthe trace route utility is really good for\n\n710\n00:35:00.481 --> 00:35:01.950\nshowing us that.\n\n711\n00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:05.960\n&gt;&gt; Don, let's say that I use a tracert,\nor trace route, and I look at the output\n\n712\n00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.785\nthere and I can see like maybe the first\nfew hops are my local ISP, and then I\n\n713\n00:35:09.785 --> 00:35:13.982\ndo see one of these IVPs these big guys\nhere, what can I do with that information,\n\n714\n00:35:13.982 --> 00:35:17.685\nas a response, if I know that,\nwell, maybe it's the ISP's network,\n\n715\n00:35:17.685 --> 00:35:20.416\nmy ISP versus something\nlike one of these big guys?\n\n716\n00:35:20.416 --> 00:35:23.779\n&gt;&gt; All right, if it's your ISP,\nyou could pick up the phone and call them,\n\n717\n00:35:23.779 --> 00:35:24.840\nyou pay them, right?\n\n718\n00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.825\nYou pay them every month, you expect\nservice, they can fix the problem,\n\n719\n00:35:27.825 --> 00:35:31.005\nwe've had that more than once, where\na fibrolink went down or something, and\n\n720\n00:35:31.005 --> 00:35:32.714\nyou gotta get engaged with the local ISP.\n\n721\n00:35:32.714 --> 00:35:36.362\nIf it's one of the people in between,\nlike Savvis, or Level3, or\n\n722\n00:35:36.362 --> 00:35:40.458\nwhatever, understand that they\nare the biggest networks in the world, and\n\n723\n00:35:40.458 --> 00:35:43.978\nthat they hire the most talented\nnetwork engineers in the world,\n\n724\n00:35:43.978 --> 00:35:46.794\nlike that's where the big\nnetwork engineers go, so\n\n725\n00:35:46.794 --> 00:35:51.420\nthey've got the best employees and they're\nmonitoring it better than anyone else.\n\n726\n00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.499\nSo, by the time you see the problem,\nthey're already well aware of it and\n\n727\n00:35:54.499 --> 00:35:57.094\nworking on a solution, so\nyou don't do anything, you wait.\n\n728\n00:35:57.094 --> 00:36:00.541\nIf the problem is the destination,\nyou might report it to them, but\n\n729\n00:36:00.541 --> 00:36:04.550\nit's hard to report it to the destination\nif their network is down.\n\n730\n00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:09.662\nIf I can't get to Adobe's website,\nand it turns out to be on their end,\n\n731\n00:36:09.662 --> 00:36:12.828\ndo you have a phone number for\nAdobe to call?\n\n732\n00:36:12.828 --> 00:36:15.632\nThey've got a sales number,\nyou can call and talk to a sales guy and\n\n733\n00:36:15.632 --> 00:36:18.486\nbuy stuff, but they don't have\na tech support number you can call,\n\n734\n00:36:18.486 --> 00:36:20.710\nthey're proud of that for some reason.\n\n735\n00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:23.333\nSo, there's nobody you can kind of\nreach out to and you just have to wait.\n\n736\n00:36:23.333 --> 00:36:26.882\nBut if it's your ISP, there is an action\nitem you can follow, you can call them up.\n\n737\n00:36:26.882 --> 00:36:29.077\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\nlot of great information.\n\n738\n00:36:29.077 --> 00:36:32.481\nNow I know we got more to go, but it does\nlook like we're running to the end of\n\n739\n00:36:32.481 --> 00:36:34.960\nthis episode judging by that time clock.\n\n740\n00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:38.784\nHowever, but before we do wrap this one\nup, do you have any additional words?\n\n741\n00:36:38.784 --> 00:36:40.318\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nremember to do your research.\n\n742\n00:36:40.318 --> 00:36:42.619\nRun trace route,\ngather this information together,\n\n743\n00:36:42.619 --> 00:36:45.869\nbecause when you fill out your trouble\nticket, this is going to be supporting\n\n744\n00:36:45.869 --> 00:36:48.420\ninformation that goes in to\nindicate where the failure was,\n\n745\n00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.140\nhow we're going to fix it, how we're going\nto route around the problem, or whatever.\n\n746\n00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.912\nYou want to make sure you document that,\nso you have an understanding of it, so\n\n747\n00:36:54.912 --> 00:36:57.643\nthat you can also come up with a way to\nprevent it from happening in the future.\n\n748\n00:36:57.643 --> 00:37:01.222\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, as always, we\nappreciate having you here in the studios\n\n749\n00:37:01.222 --> 00:37:03.950\nwith us and we appreciate,\nyou, the viewer watching.\n\n750\n00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:05.593\nWe hope you've enjoyed this episode,\n\n751\n00:37:05.593 --> 00:37:08.141\nsigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n752\n00:37:08.141 --> 00:37:09.008\n&gt;&gt; And, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n753\n00:37:09.008 --> 00:37:09.916\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n754\n00:37:09.916 --> 00:37:17.660\n[MUSIC]\n\n755\n00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.910\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.163\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.163 --> 00:00:12.054\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:15.130\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.504\nI am your host Wes Bryan and in today's\nepisode we are continuing through\n\n7\n00:00:19.504 --> 00:00:22.957\nour series in CompTIA's Server+,\nthe SK0-004.\n\n8\n00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:24.847\nWe're actually coming\nback with a part two and\n\n9\n00:00:24.847 --> 00:00:27.240\njoining us in the studio is\nnone other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.410\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.271\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing swell, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:32.950\nReady to continue on with the networking\nadventures we talk about troubleshooting.\n\n13\n00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.900\nWe talked about some of\nthe basics in the last episode.\n\n14\n00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.880\nHow we can use ping and trace route and\n\n15\n00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.070\na few other other utilities to\nfigure out where an error is.\n\n16\n00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.389\nIn this episode, I wanna continue with\nthat and cover a few more commands and\n\n17\n00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:45.106\ntake some of the commands\nwe've already talked about.\n\n18\n00:00:45.106 --> 00:00:49.100\nAnd go a little bit further with them,\nas far as isolating issues and\n\n19\n00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.020\ntrouble on the network.\n\n20\n00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.320\nAll right, so let's kick things off.\n\n21\n00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.220\nI talked about the majority of the common\nproblems in the last episode but\n\n22\n00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.960\nthere was one that I left off,\nwhich was email failure.\n\n23\n00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.420\nEmail failure is specifically called\nout on the exam and with email, well,\n\n24\n00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.040\npeople really like their email.\n\n25\n00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.420\nAnd if they can't use it,\nthey get really annoyed.\n\n26\n00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.940\nThat and browsing the Internet, right?\n\n27\n00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.730\nSo troubleshooting those are gonna\nbe common tickets that you get.\n\n28\n00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.620\nEmail, though,\nis considered critical to many businesses.\n\n29\n00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.520\nBrowsing the Internet isn't considered\n[LAUGH] critical to many businesses,\n\n30\n00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.380\nbut email is.\n\n31\n00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.220\nAnd so, when you have somebody call in\nto report an email type issue, hey,\n\n32\n00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.670\nI can't get to the mail server, well, that\ncould be a mail server problem, right?\n\n33\n00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.890\nThe server could be down,\nthe mailbox database could be offline.\n\n34\n00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.740\nPeople can't connect.\n\n35\n00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.080\nThat happens.\n\n36\n00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.030\nBut assuming that you've\nkept the database happy and\n\n37\n00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.000\nhealthy, there's certain networking\nissues that can cause a problem too.\n\n38\n00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.020\nAnd it usually centers around filtering,\nespecially on the Internet.\n\n39\n00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.090\nEmail, it gets abused a lot.\n\n40\n00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.490\nI get,\nhow many spam messages do you get a day?\n\n41\n00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.170\nI get the same,\nI get a ton every single day.\n\n42\n00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.130\nAnd fortunately, I have spam filters and\nthings like that that filter it out.\n\n43\n00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.465\nBut as a result, we can't just have\nopen email relays on the Internet,\n\n44\n00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:01.501\nlike they used to back in the day.\n\n45\n00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:03.970\nNow, everything has to be locked down.\n\n46\n00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.990\nAnd so, it's possible that you're\ntrying to connect to a mail server and\n\n47\n00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.160\nyou can't because it's being blocked.\n\n48\n00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.890\nSo for example at home,\nI have a cable broadband modem.\n\n49\n00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.730\nAnd just a regular home\ncarrier service class stuff.\n\n50\n00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.060\nAnd I get Internet connectivity and\nit works fine.\n\n51\n00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.915\nBut, from my house, if I try and\nconnect to a SMTP server on Port 25,\n\n52\n00:02:25.915 --> 00:02:30.281\nif I try to reach out on TCP\nport 25 to a SMTP server,\n\n53\n00:02:30.281 --> 00:02:35.082\nno matter what host I specify,\nCox Cable intercepts me.\n\n54\n00:02:35.082 --> 00:02:38.340\nAnd I get connected to\nthe Cox Cable SMTP server.\n\n55\n00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.650\nDoesn't matter if I'm pointing to Gmail or\nMicrosoft or anybody.\n\n56\n00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.547\nI get connected to Cox's SMTP server.\n\n57\n00:02:44.547 --> 00:02:48.088\nAnd the reason they're doing that is they\nwanna filter spam before it leaves their\n\n58\n00:02:48.088 --> 00:02:50.880\nnetwork so that they don't get\nflagged as a spam relay, right?\n\n59\n00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.420\nThey're trying to take that extra step.\n\n60\n00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.060\nThat causes problems.\n\n61\n00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.150\nFor example, the ITPro.TV domain.\n\n62\n00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.510\nWhen I send email, it's don@itpro.tv and\nwe use SPF records and\n\n63\n00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.040\nDCIM digital signing to make sure that\npeople know our emails are legitimate.\n\n64\n00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.960\nThat it is actually from me and\nnot somebody impersonating me.\n\n65\n00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.520\nWell, if my email, my outgoing emails\nare intercepted by Cox Cable and\n\n66\n00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.470\nsent through their SMTP servers,\nwhat happens?\n\n67\n00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.680\nIt looks like spam.\n\n68\n00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.260\nIt looks like it's coming\nfrom somebody who isn't me.\n\n69\n00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.460\nAnd that's a problem.\n\n70\n00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.010\nSo not a problem on our servers, but\n\n71\n00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.980\na problem with the network in\nbetween our clients and our servers.\n\n72\n00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.430\nAnd that's why it's so important to move\npeople over to encrypted connections.\n\n73\n00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:38.170\nSo if you're doing SMTPS, right, if you're\ndoing SMTP using SSL over port 587.\n\n74\n00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.090\nNow it's encrypted and\n\n75\n00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.170\nit can't be intercepted by\nwhoever your ISP is, or whatever.\n\n76\n00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.410\nAnd it'll have to go to the actual\nserver to be able to relay out.\n\n77\n00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.228\nOr you may have to leverage VPN tunnels.\n\n78\n00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:52.096\nI've been in hotel networks where just\nno matter what you did you couldn't\n\n79\n00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:52.606\nsend email.\n\n80\n00:03:52.606 --> 00:03:57.440\nSo I had to VPN back into my office\nto be able to email and communicate.\n\n81\n00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.490\nThose things all happen, right?\n\n82\n00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.630\nAnd those are all stuff that can\ncause email not to function.\n\n83\n00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.330\nAfter that, it's just a matter of\nkeeping your email server up and online.\n\n84\n00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.525\nNow if you ever need\nto troubleshoot email,\n\n85\n00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:10.310\nthere's actually a neat\nway that you can do it.\n\n86\n00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.199\nIf you know your email server,\n\n87\n00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.430\nyou can just use the telnet\ncommand to troubleshoot it.\n\n88\n00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.879\nSo, for example,\nif I'm trying to send an email to Wes, and\n\n89\n00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:22.918\nWes says, yeah, just email me.\n\n90\n00:04:22.918 --> 00:04:24.467\nIt's wes@aol.com.\n\n91\n00:04:24.467 --> 00:04:25.831\nBecause Wes is old school.\n\n92\n00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:28.279\nWell, I wanna send him an email.\n\n93\n00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:33.440\nSo I can come in here and I can take\nnslookup and I can set my type to MX,\n\n94\n00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.801\nso I'm gonna look for MX records,\nand I can do aol.com.\n\n95\n00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:40.715\nAnd I can find out the mail servers for\nAOL.\n\n96\n00:04:40.715 --> 00:04:46.620\nSo here's a mail server for AOL,\nmailin-03.mx.aol.com, okay?\n\n97\n00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.280\nAnd then I can take that and I can Telnet\n\n98\n00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.290\ninto that host and specify a port number.\n\n99\n00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.170\nI'm gonna tell it to Telnet on port 25.\n\n100\n00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.610\nAnd, shoot,\nactually you don't need a -p on this one.\n\n101\n00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.440\nThere, and what should happen is,\nyou should connect.\n\n102\n00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.730\nIf you connect, and you get a header,\nsee I got a header here.\n\n103\n00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.684\n421 mtaig-ma blah blah blah,\nservice unavailable, try again later.\n\n104\n00:05:14.684 --> 00:05:16.172\nThat's an odd little message to get,\nright?\n\n105\n00:05:16.172 --> 00:05:18.030\nIt's telling me service not available.\n\n106\n00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.560\nIt's because I didn't follow that up\nwith the email commands that I wanted.\n\n107\n00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.610\nInstead, I did a get a header though.\n\n108\n00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.920\nTheir mail server talked to me.\n\n109\n00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.730\nIt told me that it was there.\n\n110\n00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.919\nSo I know I can communicate on port 25.\n\n111\n00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.900\nIt's a neat way to test.\n\n112\n00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.750\nYou can actually use Telnet\nto test a lot of things.\n\n113\n00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.560\nYou can connect to servers on port 80\njust to test whether the base HTTP\n\n114\n00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.900\nis functioning or other things.\n\n115\n00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.890\nYou can connect on port 22 for SSH.\n\n116\n00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.260\nAnd you should see a certificate\nmessage pop up and\n\n117\n00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.420\nthen you stop communicating\ncuz you're not encrypted.\n\n118\n00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.755\nSo, those are simply ways that we\ncan test basic connectivity by using\n\n119\n00:05:49.755 --> 00:05:51.633\nport numbers with the Telnet command.\n\n120\n00:05:51.633 --> 00:05:53.709\nTelnet doesn't just have to be used for\nTelnet.\n\n121\n00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:57.595\nIn fact, I probably use it more for\ntroubleshooting than I do for Telnet.\n\n122\n00:05:57.595 --> 00:06:00.175\nI don't establish Telnet sessions anymore.\n\n123\n00:06:00.175 --> 00:06:02.179\nBut I use it plenty of times for\ntesting other protocols.\n\n124\n00:06:04.298 --> 00:06:06.545\nAll right, some of the other\nthings we need to think about.\n\n125\n00:06:06.545 --> 00:06:14.760\nI mentioned the I mentioned VLANs in the\nlast episode, Virtual Local Area Networks.\n\n126\n00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.810\nAnd I wanted to show you guys an example\nof how that kind of thing works.\n\n127\n00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.490\nThat when you connect\ninto a enterprise switch,\n\n128\n00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.160\na switch that has a tons of ports in it.\n\n129\n00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.700\nWell, those ports are not\nnecessarily all connected together.\n\n130\n00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:36.010\nThose ports could be subdivided and broken\nup into a number of different networks.\n\n131\n00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.730\nSo this switch that I'm pulling\nup right now is actually\n\n132\n00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.130\nthe big switch that's in\nthe background behind Wes.\n\n133\n00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.690\nIt's got a ton of ports in it, right?\n\n134\n00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.413\nSo here's all these different ports that\nwe've got, for all these different cards,\n\n135\n00:06:47.413 --> 00:06:48.695\nand some of them are gigabit.\n\n136\n00:06:48.695 --> 00:06:53.175\nMost of these are gigabit poe ports, and\nthen we've got some down here that are 10\n\n137\n00:06:53.175 --> 00:06:56.750\ngigabit ports and\nsome extra fiber ports there.\n\n138\n00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.039\nBut not every port is\nbeing treated the same.\n\n139\n00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:06.410\nWhen you look at some of these ports,\nthey can be on different VLANs.\n\n140\n00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.472\nSo for example,\nthere might be an interface here that my\n\n141\n00:07:09.472 --> 00:07:12.349\nlaptop is plugged into, and\nit might be on VLAN one.\n\n142\n00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:17.287\nAnd then there might be another\ninterface here somewhere that is\n\n143\n00:07:17.287 --> 00:07:19.430\non a different VLAN.\n\n144\n00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.220\nBecause it's connected to\na Internet network, right?\n\n145\n00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.910\nMaybe it's one of our WAN interfaces.\n\n146\n00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.510\nAnd so it's isolated out.\n\n147\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:30.030\nAnd I can't just tell by looking\nat the front of the switch, right?\n\n148\n00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.390\nI actually have to go into\nthat VLAN communication or\n\n149\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.780\nconfiguration to find out what's going on.\n\n150\n00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.970\nAnd so\nif I go into the VLAN management side,\n\n151\n00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.340\nI can see where we've got all\nsorts of different VLANs created.\n\n152\n00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.006\nAll for different things like vlan 110 for\nlab machines.\n\n153\n00:07:44.006 --> 00:07:47.523\nWe have our lab machines separated\nout because one of our other hosts,\n\n154\n00:07:47.523 --> 00:07:50.453\nMike Rodrick,\nis always doing this hacky exploit stuff.\n\n155\n00:07:50.453 --> 00:07:52.838\nAnd so you can't have that on your\nregular network, so we separate that out.\n\n156\n00:07:52.838 --> 00:07:54.764\nSo you have each of these.\n\n157\n00:07:54.764 --> 00:07:57.140\nHere's some of the WAN interfaces\nthat pass through our switches.\n\n158\n00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.271\nAnd when we look at those and we you\ncome down you'll see it's port based and\n\n159\n00:08:01.271 --> 00:08:02.591\nI can pull up the ports.\n\n160\n00:08:02.591 --> 00:08:06.669\nIt's only ports A1, A2 and B1.\n\n161\n00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:11.824\nSo when I go back out\nto my main switch view,\n\n162\n00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:17.422\nA1, A2 and B1, that's A1, A2 and B1.\n\n163\n00:08:17.422 --> 00:08:21.130\nThose three ports,\nthey're on a separate VLAN.\n\n164\n00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.362\nAnd nobody else is gonna be able to talk\nto them unless they're on that same VLAN.\n\n165\n00:08:25.362 --> 00:08:28.184\nSo just understand that if you plug in\na network cable for your server and\n\n166\n00:08:28.184 --> 00:08:31.163\nyou get a link light, it doesn't\nguarantee you're on the right network.\n\n167\n00:08:31.163 --> 00:08:33.800\nThat that switch may be\nsubdivided out like that.\n\n168\n00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.950\nAnd the network team can jump in there and\ncorrect it and assign VLANs as needed.\n\n169\n00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.280\nWhere it gets really tricky,\nthough, are trunks.\n\n170\n00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:46.720\nA trunk is where you have one link\nthat's carrying more than one VLAN.\n\n171\n00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.756\nFor example,\nI believe this port is a trunk for us.\n\n172\n00:08:49.756 --> 00:08:50.348\nWhich is gonna be what?\n\n173\n00:08:50.348 --> 00:08:52.148\nA21.\n\n174\n00:08:52.148 --> 00:08:56.184\nSo if I come in and\npull up that interface, and\n\n175\n00:08:56.184 --> 00:09:00.940\ntake a look at A21,\nlet me just find it real quick.\n\n176\n00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.270\nIf I pull up A21 and come down and\n\n177\n00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.630\nlook at what VLAN its on, or actually I\npulled up its physical status, haven't I?\n\n178\n00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.568\nYeah, that's not gonna help me.\n\n179\n00:09:08.568 --> 00:09:13.617\nSo if I pull up its VLANs though,\nit'll actually be on more than one VLAN.\n\n180\n00:09:13.617 --> 00:09:16.945\nAnd the reason it's on more than\none VLAN is because it's a trunk,\n\n181\n00:09:16.945 --> 00:09:19.270\nit's carrying several different networks.\n\n182\n00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:24.891\nSo when I take a look at the networks that\nI have available like IT Pro TV Guest and\n\n183\n00:09:24.891 --> 00:09:28.979\nlook at its ports,\nI'll find where it's tied to A21,\n\n184\n00:09:28.979 --> 00:09:31.727\nright there, written really small.\n\n185\n00:09:31.727 --> 00:09:35.732\nBut then if I go and look at another VLAN,\nlike instead of ITProTV guest,\n\n186\n00:09:35.732 --> 00:09:37.253\nwe'll do DEFAULT_VLAN.\n\n187\n00:09:37.253 --> 00:09:41.443\nAnd I can go in and find where\nA21 is on the default VLAN also.\n\n188\n00:09:41.443 --> 00:09:43.461\nIt's carrying more than one VLAN.\n\n189\n00:09:43.461 --> 00:09:45.504\nNow normally you would\nnever do that to a server.\n\n190\n00:09:45.504 --> 00:09:47.796\nYou'd do that between switches.\n\n191\n00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:50.491\nBut there's one scenario where you\nwould do that to a server, and\n\n192\n00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:53.220\nthat's when you're doing virtualization.\n\n193\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.860\nIf you're doing virtualization,\n\n194\n00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.490\nyou may have VMs that need\nto be on different networks.\n\n195\n00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.760\nSo you can run one cable from\nyour switch to your server.\n\n196\n00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.110\nThat's a trunk that's\ncarrying more than one VLAN.\n\n197\n00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.130\nAnd if your network adapter recognizes it\nand your operating system recognizes it,\n\n198\n00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.100\nnow you can assign VLAN numbers\nto your virtual machines.\n\n199\n00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.310\nAnd they get separated out, right?\n\n200\n00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.130\nMost of the systems out\nthere do support it.\n\n201\n00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.382\nLet me connect to a virtualization\nserver real quick.\n\n202\n00:10:17.382 --> 00:10:20.602\nAnd I'll show you,\nthis is a Microsoft Hyper-V server.\n\n203\n00:10:20.602 --> 00:10:22.990\nIt's the same thing in VMware.\n\n204\n00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:27.447\nAnd other products like that that when you\ncome in to a virtualization server and\n\n205\n00:10:27.447 --> 00:10:31.371\nyou start configuring the networking\nside of things, I can come in and\n\n206\n00:10:31.371 --> 00:10:32.588\ncreate a new switch.\n\n207\n00:10:32.588 --> 00:10:36.298\nI'm gonna create a new external switch and\nyou can define it and\n\n208\n00:10:36.298 --> 00:10:37.768\nnotice right down here.\n\n209\n00:10:37.768 --> 00:10:41.790\nEnable virtual LAN identification for\nmanagement operating system.\n\n210\n00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:46.740\nI can assign a VLAN ID and I can say, yes,\nthis is attached to this Intel Pro 1000.\n\n211\n00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.619\nBut it's VLAN 10.\n\n212\n00:10:48.619 --> 00:10:52.387\nAnd I can create another network that's\nalso attached to the Intel PRO/1000,\n\n213\n00:10:52.387 --> 00:10:53.190\nit's VLAN 20.\n\n214\n00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.510\nAnd now we've separated those out.\n\n215\n00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.790\nIf I have the wrong VLAN number in,\n\n216\n00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.830\nthe virtual machine is\nnow on the wrong network.\n\n217\n00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.300\nIt's gonna have the wrong IP address.\n\n218\n00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.730\nIt's gonna have the wrong default\ngateway cuz it's on the wrong network.\n\n219\n00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.290\nIt's the equivalent of plugging\ninto the wrong switch.\n\n220\n00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.830\nSo we gotta make sure\nwe keep that straight.\n\n221\n00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:11.510\nSo some of you were probably thinking, why\nwere you talking about VLANs in Server+?\n\n222\n00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.610\nBecause virtualization is\na very common thing and\n\n223\n00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.710\nyou use VLANs inside\nyour virtual environment.\n\n224\n00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:18.650\nYou're creating virtual switches here.\n\n225\n00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.640\nSo it's a lot of bleedover to Network+.\n\n226\n00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.550\nBut it's important to use on the server,\ntoo.\n\n227\n00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:27.255\n&gt;&gt; Don, could there be any configuration\non the switch that might have it turned\n\n228\n00:11:27.255 --> 00:11:30.447\noff where they'd be inaccessible\nto a device that might cause some\n\n229\n00:11:30.447 --> 00:11:31.749\ncommunication issues?\n\n230\n00:11:31.749 --> 00:11:32.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n231\n00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.590\nYeah, proper security practices,\n\n232\n00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:38.990\nwhich I know we're not exactly following\non this switch [LAUGH] in the background.\n\n233\n00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:43.235\nProper security practices say that\nif you have a port that is empty,\n\n234\n00:11:43.235 --> 00:11:44.734\nit should be disabled.\n\n235\n00:11:44.734 --> 00:11:49.780\nSo if you've got a hardcore security team\nthat is doing the best job possible,\n\n236\n00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.160\nthey're gonna look at your switch.\n\n237\n00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.960\nAnd they're gonna say, all right,\nlooks like port number A7, A7 is empty.\n\n238\n00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.560\nThere's nothing plugged into it.\n\n239\n00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.530\nWe need to disable that port, right?\n\n240\n00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.450\nBecause you don't wanna have a port\nconfigured for a network and\n\n241\n00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.090\nsomebody just comes along and plugs into\nit and gets access they shouldn't have.\n\n242\n00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.640\nSo it should be disabled.\n\n243\n00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.990\nSo what they'll do is they'll go into\nan interface and they'll pull it up so\n\n244\n00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.780\nI can take like A7.\n\n245\n00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.640\nAnd then in A7,\nsee how it says enabled, yes?\n\n246\n00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.690\nThey can just edit that status,\nchange it, and disable it.\n\n247\n00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.466\nSo now we can take that port and we can\ndisable it, and no matter who plugs in,\n\n248\n00:12:23.466 --> 00:12:25.011\nit's not gonna work, right?\n\n249\n00:12:25.011 --> 00:12:27.530\nNow in that scenario, we'll know\nit cuz we won't get a link light.\n\n250\n00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.645\nYou'll plug into the port,\nyou won't get a link light.\n\n251\n00:12:29.645 --> 00:12:31.829\nBut there are technologies out\nthere like on Cisco switches,\n\n252\n00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:34.155\nwhere they have what's\ncalled port security.\n\n253\n00:12:34.155 --> 00:12:37.225\nWhere they can hardcode\na Mac address to the port.\n\n254\n00:12:37.225 --> 00:12:39.645\nAnd if you plug in your system\nat the wrong Mac address,\n\n255\n00:12:39.645 --> 00:12:40.465\nit can turn the port off.\n\n256\n00:12:40.465 --> 00:12:42.725\nNow when it does that,\nyou still get a link light.\n\n257\n00:12:42.725 --> 00:12:46.216\nYou still a link light on the port,\nbut you're not allowed to talk on it.\n\n258\n00:12:46.216 --> 00:12:49.326\nSo port security is a technology\nimplemented on the switch side,\n\n259\n00:12:49.326 --> 00:12:51.938\nthat again your network team\ncan isolate and find out.\n\n260\n00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.089\nAnd then correct for you if need be.\n\n261\n00:12:54.089 --> 00:12:58.734\nBut that can happen where physically\neverything looks fine, but\n\n262\n00:12:58.734 --> 00:13:01.276\nlogically that port is turned off.\n\n263\n00:13:01.276 --> 00:13:04.599\nAll right, how about a couple other\nthings that can cause us some problems.\n\n264\n00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.740\nGeneral component failure, right?\n\n265\n00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.152\nComponent failure would be, for\nexample, my network adapter failing.\n\n266\n00:13:11.152 --> 00:13:14.145\nAnd network adapters don't fail that\noften, but they do fail, it can happen,\n\n267\n00:13:14.145 --> 00:13:16.827\nand they're field-replaceable units,\nit's easy to swap them out,\n\n268\n00:13:16.827 --> 00:13:19.100\nunless they're integrated\ninto the motherboard.\n\n269\n00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.770\nCuz then you have the replace the whole\nmotherboard, and that's a bit of a pain.\n\n270\n00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:25.356\nIf you're systems under warranty,\nit's not that big of a deal, but it it's\n\n271\n00:13:25.356 --> 00:13:29.072\nnot under warranty replacing a motherboard\nusually means replacing a server.\n\n272\n00:13:29.072 --> 00:13:33.395\nSo, in that scenario, you could add extra\nnetwork adapters just to make up for it.\n\n273\n00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:36.002\nBut if you've already got one\ncomponent failing on the motherboard,\n\n274\n00:13:36.002 --> 00:13:37.735\nit's usually gonna continue on and\ncascade.\n\n275\n00:13:37.735 --> 00:13:38.854\nMore components will fail.\n\n276\n00:13:38.854 --> 00:13:41.830\nSo typically it's time to replace\nthat server if that happens.\n\n277\n00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.580\nObviously, you don't wanna do that.\n\n278\n00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.580\nHow do you know if your\nnetwork adapter is failing?\n\n279\n00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.830\nWell, usually it just disappears.\n\n280\n00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.390\nYou don't see it anymore.\n\n281\n00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.160\nIt's gone.\n\n282\n00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.150\nIn a Linux environment,\nyou might run Ifconfig.\n\n283\n00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.508\nAnd it just doesn't even show\nup here on the list, right?\n\n284\n00:13:58.508 --> 00:14:02.003\nI've got network adapters in here and\nif it's an ethernet adapter in a Linux\n\n285\n00:14:02.003 --> 00:14:04.364\nsystem, it'll normally start with ENO,\nright?\n\n286\n00:14:04.364 --> 00:14:06.461\nSo letting me know that\nit's an ethernet adapter.\n\n287\n00:14:06.461 --> 00:14:09.931\nSo I might take a look\nat the d message output.\n\n288\n00:14:09.931 --> 00:14:13.452\nWhen your system boots up, a Linux system\nboots up, it detects all its hardware.\n\n289\n00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:18.169\nAnd d message shows me all the stuff that\nwas detected at boot time, and it's a lot.\n\n290\n00:14:18.169 --> 00:14:20.680\nThere's a ton of stuff that's detected.\n\n291\n00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.220\nSo what you can do\n\n292\n00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.800\nis you can filter that using\nsomething like GREP and look for ENO.\n\n293\n00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.960\nAnd then you'll see all the adapters\nthat were detected at boot time and so\n\n294\n00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.510\nI can spot and see whether it was\npicked up and detected and so on.\n\n295\n00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.450\nYou can look and see if it shows up.\n\n296\n00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:42.070\nIn Windows,\nyou can do the same thing with IPconfig.\n\n297\n00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.520\nIt'll show you your adapters and\nthey should be detected here,\n\n298\n00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.440\neven if they're not connected.\n\n299\n00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.500\nSee this tunnel adapter\nthat's not connected?\n\n300\n00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.630\nIt still shows up but\nyou can also see it through the GUI,\n\n301\n00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.740\nit'll show up in your network and Internet\nconnection so you'll see it in there.\n\n302\n00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.830\nIf it's not there,\nyou can look in your device manager.\n\n303\n00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:03.240\nAnd your device manager should show up\njust because the hardware was detected.\n\n304\n00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.190\nIt's possible the network adapter was\ndetected, but we didn't have a driver for\n\n305\n00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.690\nit and if you don't have a driver,\nyou can't use it, right?\n\n306\n00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.672\nSo, it'll show up in the device manager,\nbut\n\n307\n00:15:13.672 --> 00:15:16.731\nit'll have something\nlike a yellow triangle,\n\n308\n00:15:16.731 --> 00:15:21.407\nor a red circle on it with a x in it\nletting you know that it's not working.\n\n309\n00:15:21.407 --> 00:15:24.960\nNow, you can disable network adaptors.\n\n310\n00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.857\nI'm not gonna do that,\ncuz I'm remoted into this machine.\n\n311\n00:15:26.857 --> 00:15:28.329\nIt'll make it harder for\nme to stay remote.\n\n312\n00:15:28.329 --> 00:15:32.152\nBut if you disable it, the hardware\nis there, the driver is there.\n\n313\n00:15:32.152 --> 00:15:36.104\nBut the software's broken,\nit's turned off.\n\n314\n00:15:36.104 --> 00:15:40.896\nYou can update a driver and run into\nproblems and you might need to roll back.\n\n315\n00:15:40.896 --> 00:15:43.986\nWindows has a nice little system here\nwhere you can pull up the properties and\n\n316\n00:15:43.986 --> 00:15:45.760\nyou can go into the driver tab.\n\n317\n00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.240\nAnd if it's updated the driver,\nyou can roll it back.\n\n318\n00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.260\nSo if it stops working,\nyou roll back to the previous driver and\n\n319\n00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.160\nget it working again.\n\n320\n00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.672\nSo there's a lot of tools like that\nthat are built into the systems that\n\n321\n00:15:53.672 --> 00:15:54.193\nlet you do it.\n\n322\n00:15:54.193 --> 00:15:57.001\nIn the Unix world,\nyou'd have the IF up and\n\n323\n00:15:57.001 --> 00:16:01.762\nIF down commands where you can take\ninterfaces and turn them up and down.\n\n324\n00:16:01.762 --> 00:16:04.124\nIt's a good way to reset an adapter and\ntest things.\n\n325\n00:16:04.124 --> 00:16:07.218\nSo there's a lot of stuff that's\noperating system specific but\n\n326\n00:16:07.218 --> 00:16:10.740\nall of them are just different ways\nto check and test the network.\n\n327\n00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:15.800\nAnd you just have to remember that you can\nhave physical as well as logical problems.\n\n328\n00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:21.369\nNow other problems that we can bump into,\nfirewalls I've mentioned.\n\n329\n00:16:21.369 --> 00:16:22.868\nThere's firewalls on the network,\n\n330\n00:16:22.868 --> 00:16:25.620\nthat can be filtering your\ntraffic as it passes through.\n\n331\n00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.630\nAnd there's firewalls locally.\n\n332\n00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.270\nRemember I mentioned that,\nhow sometimes people block pings.\n\n333\n00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.120\nIf I try and ping a server.\n\n334\n00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.400\nSo for example this is my server, and\n\n335\n00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.570\nI was able to ping it\nearlier from wherever I was.\n\n336\n00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.740\nI forgotten a little bit lost in\nall my virtual machine craziness.\n\n337\n00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:45.485\nSo if I try and ping for, well,\nhere let me do it from Linux.\n\n338\n00:16:45.485 --> 00:16:48.640\nSo I'm gonna ping 10.0.222.223.\n\n339\n00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.140\nSo I'm gonna ping my server.\n\n340\n00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.530\nThere it is, I'm pinging it just fine.\n\n341\n00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.690\nThe server's up, everything's happy.\n\n342\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.945\nWell, on that Window's\nserver it has a firewall.\n\n343\n00:16:57.945 --> 00:17:01.865\nAnd that firewall has\nits own set of rules.\n\n344\n00:17:01.865 --> 00:17:06.695\nAnd the rules are what Microsoft\nfelt would be good rules.\n\n345\n00:17:06.695 --> 00:17:09.305\nAnd you'll see that I've added some,\nI added a Don's laptop rule.\n\n346\n00:17:09.305 --> 00:17:12.700\nI wanted to make sure that my laptop would\nalways get into that server, that I could\n\n347\n00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.410\nalways get there and not be blocked,\nbecause I don't wanna lock myself out.\n\n348\n00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.260\nBut, I don't wanna open it up\nto the entire world, right?\n\n349\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.380\nSo all these other rules are specifying\nwhat other people can do.\n\n350\n00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:26.486\nAnd you'll see core networking, which is\nas usual the base functions that we need.\n\n351\n00:17:26.486 --> 00:17:31.454\nAnd as you look through here, you'll\nsee things like whether we're allowing\n\n352\n00:17:31.454 --> 00:17:37.060\nweb traffic in, or IPv6 traffic in,\nrouter advertisements, DCOM and so on.\n\n353\n00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:42.480\nAnd as we look through here,\nyou'll be able to find pings in ICMP,\n\n354\n00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.670\nthey're in here somewhere.\n\n355\n00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.660\nLet's see if I can find it.\n\n356\n00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.810\nHere's a couple rules for\nvirtual machine monitoring,\n\n357\n00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.770\nwhether it's allowing ICMP version four,\nversion six in.\n\n358\n00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:54.720\nAnd see how these are grayed out?\n\n359\n00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.440\nThose rules are turned off.\n\n360\n00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.200\nSo someone can create a firewall\nrule that prevented the type of\n\n361\n00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.880\ncommunication that I'm trying to do.\n\n362\n00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.610\nAnd if it's prevented,\nthen I'm not gonna be able to use it.\n\n363\n00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:06.020\nAnd I might think the server's down,\nwhen it's actually up.\n\n364\n00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.660\nJust because I can't ping it,\ndoesn't mean that it's down.\n\n365\n00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:09.710\nOkay there.\n\n366\n00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:14.380\nSo here I can see under file and printer\nsharing echo request ICMP version 4N\n\n367\n00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.100\nis being allowed,\nit's got a green circle beside it.\n\n368\n00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.310\nIf I turn that off,\nI'm gonna disable that rule.\n\n369\n00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.710\nNow, pings aren't allowed,\nand when I go over here,\n\n370\n00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.990\nwhat I should see is that I'm gonna\nstart getting failures, okay?\n\n371\n00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:29.070\nI've got a full screen here,\nso it's hard to tell,\n\n372\n00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:32.770\nbut see how this sequence\n90 hasn't gone to 91 yet?\n\n373\n00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:36.910\nIt's been doing it every two seconds, but\nnow I'm just sitting here, like that.\n\n374\n00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:41.970\nNow, if I stop it and restart it, so\nI'm gonna just redo that ping and\n\n375\n00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.500\nrun it, you can see it just kind\nof sitting here and timing out.\n\n376\n00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.990\nMeanwhile, I could bring\nup another tab and\n\n377\n00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:52.910\nping somebody else, right,\nso I'll open up a new tab.\n\n378\n00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:57.740\nAnd I'm gonna ping to cnn.com, and\nI can see a ping going well there,\n\n379\n00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.640\nand then I can jump back over here,\nnothing.\n\n380\n00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.700\nSo, the firewall is blocking it, be aware\nthat you've got your physical firewalls on\n\n381\n00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.580\nyour network, and your logical\nfirewalls on your operating systems.\n\n382\n00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.470\nIn Windows we have the Windows firewall,\nin Red Hat you have firewall d\n\n383\n00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:15.110\nwhich you interact with by\nusing the firewall cmd command.\n\n384\n00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:20.516\nSo when you run firewall cmd,\nif it's firewall ctl.\n\n385\n00:19:20.516 --> 00:19:22.370\nApparently I don't have it installed.\n\n386\n00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.232\nWell, isn't that exciting.\n\n387\n00:19:24.232 --> 00:19:27.480\n[LAUGH] You know what,\nI'm not root either,\n\n388\n00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.500\nbut we have firewall D running in\nthe background that you can interact with.\n\n389\n00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.447\nOn a lot of other Linux distros, you have\niptables and so you've got to go and\n\n390\n00:19:33.447 --> 00:19:36.640\nedit the config files for iptables\nto get in and mess around with that.\n\n391\n00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.510\nBut you got a few different options in\nthere for how you wanna manipulate or\n\n392\n00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.390\nwork with those and\nopen up your ports and close them.\n\n393\n00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.630\nSo just be aware that you\ncould have firewall issues.\n\n394\n00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.350\nAll right, we also talked a little bit in\nthe last episode about DNS lookups and\n\n395\n00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.450\nhow we couldn't get to a DNS server.\n\n396\n00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:56.380\nThere was one thing I forgot to\nmention in that episode which is,\n\n397\n00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.850\nyou can override your DNS settings, right?\n\n398\n00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.680\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n399\n00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.590\nThis is getting to be less and\nless common but\n\n400\n00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.040\na lot of people do when they're\ntesting and troubleshooting.\n\n401\n00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.000\nIf I can't do a DNS lookup for\nsome reason, right?\n\n402\n00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.300\nI'm trying to do a lookup and it's just\nfailing for whatever reason, I might\n\n403\n00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:18.130\nchoose to override the DNS servers just\nto eliminate DNS's part of the problem.\n\n404\n00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:20.293\nSo when I do an NS lookup for\nsomething like,\n\n405\n00:20:20.293 --> 00:20:22.518\nwell here we'll just do ITPro.TV, right.\n\n406\n00:20:22.518 --> 00:20:28.380\nITPro.TV resolves to 192.124.249.106,\nright?\n\n407\n00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.250\nSo that's the IP address that\nI'm resolving as, right now.\n\n408\n00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:33.720\nAnd where do they get that answer from?\n\n409\n00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:39.320\nI've got the answer from 8.8.8.8,\nfrom Google's public DNS servers.\n\n410\n00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:44.458\nWell, I can override that\nif I edit a little file\n\n411\n00:20:44.458 --> 00:20:50.762\nthat is buried away inside of\nthe Windows configuration.\n\n412\n00:20:52.634 --> 00:20:58.950\nHere,\nC:\\windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts.\n\n413\n00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.750\nIn Linux, it's in etc/hosts.\n\n414\n00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.650\nIt's a lot easier to find it.\n\n415\n00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:08.390\nBut if I edit that file,\nI can override names to IPs.\n\n416\n00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:12.685\nSo for example,\nthis is the IP that points to ITPRO.TV.\n\n417\n00:21:12.685 --> 00:21:18.440\nWell, I could override that and\nI'll say 1.1.1.1\n\n418\n00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.790\npoints to ITPro.tv which is not accurate.\n\n419\n00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.960\nBut maybe for testing purposes,\nI need to point somewhere else.\n\n420\n00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.045\nI might have a production,\nand a test server.\n\n421\n00:21:28.045 --> 00:21:30.535\nAnd so normally I am going to\nproduction but I need to override and\n\n422\n00:21:30.535 --> 00:21:34.045\npoint to test for a minute while I try\nsomething out, and then I can put it back.\n\n423\n00:21:34.045 --> 00:21:37.605\nThat's an easy way to make the names\nwork on an alternate server.\n\n424\n00:21:37.605 --> 00:21:42.062\nSo I am gonna set that and\nexit out of that file.\n\n425\n00:21:42.062 --> 00:21:44.102\nNow here's where it gets tricky.\n\n426\n00:21:44.102 --> 00:21:48.122\nSome utilities recognize the host file and\nsome don't.\n\n427\n00:21:48.122 --> 00:21:55.132\nIf I try and ping itpro.tv right now,\nit's trying to ping 1.1.1.1, right?\n\n428\n00:21:55.132 --> 00:21:57.242\nIt's been overwritten,\nthat's the wrong IP.\n\n429\n00:21:58.482 --> 00:22:03.760\nBut if I do an nslookup of\nitpro.tv what do I get?\n\n430\n00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.888\nI get the right IP,\nnow that's really weird, why is that?\n\n431\n00:22:06.888 --> 00:22:11.890\nWell nslookup bypasses the host file.\n\n432\n00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.780\nIt doesn't use any local cached values or\n\n433\n00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.970\nany host files, it just goes\nstraight out to the DNS server.\n\n434\n00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:21.450\nIt's a name server lookup utility,\nyou're looking up against the name server.\n\n435\n00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:26.196\nWell ping on the other hand,\nuses the whole lookup process.\n\n436\n00:22:26.196 --> 00:22:30.550\nIt uses where it looks to the host file\nfirst, actually looks to the cache first,\n\n437\n00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:33.910\nthen looks to the host file and\nthen it looks up against the DNS server.\n\n438\n00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:37.750\nSo it's going through each one and\nI might have bad values somewhere.\n\n439\n00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.710\nIf I have bad values in the cache,\nthat's not a big deal.\n\n440\n00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:45.740\nWe can do ipconfig /flushdns and\nthat will wipe out that cache, right?\n\n441\n00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:50.146\nSo I don't have that anymore but the host\nfile I'm gonna have to go and edit that.\n\n442\n00:22:50.146 --> 00:22:51.800\nI have to go edit and undo it.\n\n443\n00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.880\nRemove it.\nYou'll see a lot of rootkits and\n\n444\n00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.440\nmalware that will override\nthings in the host file.\n\n445\n00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.440\nSo like when you try and go to google,\ninstead you go to some malware site.\n\n446\n00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.970\nSo it's an attack vector.\n\n447\n00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:05.560\nAnd that's why a lot of vendors have\nbeen trying to get rid of that file, but\n\n448\n00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.550\nit still serves a pretty\nimportant purpose, so it's there.\n\n449\n00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:11.180\nAnd you have it in Linux, too,\nit's not just a Windows thing.\n\n450\n00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:16.880\nIf I go into the /etc/ folder, I will find\nthe hosts file dumped in here somewhere.\n\n451\n00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.760\nRight here, hosts.\n\n452\n00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.770\nAnd it's basically formatted the same way.\n\n453\n00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.310\nIt's got an IP on the left,\nfollowed by a name or\n\n454\n00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.000\nnames on the right, and that's that.\n\n455\n00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:27.930\nSo you can overwrite it.\n\n456\n00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.670\nSame thing, same basic principle there.\n\n457\n00:23:31.615 --> 00:23:35.235\nOkay, let's see, I think we are nearing\nthe end of our little journey here.\n\n458\n00:23:35.235 --> 00:23:38.075\nCouple last little odds and\nends that we need to get to.\n\n459\n00:23:38.075 --> 00:23:40.685\nIn the last episode,\nwe talked about routes.\n\n460\n00:23:40.685 --> 00:23:43.190\nAnd I used under Windows\nthe route print command.\n\n461\n00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.990\nAnd under Linux or\nUnix I use the netstack command.\n\n462\n00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.620\nNetstack can do a heck of a lot\nmore than just show routes.\n\n463\n00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:50.400\nSo I wanna talk about that.\n\n464\n00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.810\nBut I also wanna mention\nanother thing about routes.\n\n465\n00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:58.001\nUnder Windows and in Unix, you can\nenter in routes manually if you want.\n\n466\n00:23:58.001 --> 00:23:58.965\nThere's times when you need that.\n\n467\n00:23:58.965 --> 00:24:01.871\nI might have a VPN tunnel available for\na partner network and\n\n468\n00:24:01.871 --> 00:24:03.974\nI wanna send that traffic a different way.\n\n469\n00:24:03.974 --> 00:24:06.215\nSo for example,\nI could drop here to the command prompt.\n\n470\n00:24:06.215 --> 00:24:12.941\nAnd I can say, route add, and\nI can add a route for a network.\n\n471\n00:24:12.941 --> 00:24:22.270\nI can say, for example, I want\nthe 10.5.0.0 network and provide its mask.\n\n472\n00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:26.255\nI want that network to be available\nvia a different default gateway.\n\n473\n00:24:26.255 --> 00:24:28.671\nI'm going to point it to 10.0.0.2, right?\n\n474\n00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:30.340\nAnd I can add that in.\n\n475\n00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.330\nNow when I add it in this way,\nit's not persistent.\n\n476\n00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.742\nIf I reboot it's going to go away.\n\n477\n00:24:33.742 --> 00:24:37.512\nIf I add a -p,\nit'll become permanent, it'll stay.\n\n478\n00:24:37.512 --> 00:24:40.000\nAnd then even if I reboot,\nthat route will be there.\n\n479\n00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.100\nAnd when I override it like that,\nif I do a route print and\n\n480\n00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.360\nlook at my routing table,\nit'll show up in there.\n\n481\n00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.248\nSo as I look at my routing table,\n\n482\n00:24:49.248 --> 00:24:54.150\nhere's the 10.0 that I get because\nI'm plugged into that network.\n\n483\n00:24:54.150 --> 00:25:01.605\nAnd right below it here,\nI've got 10.5.0.0 is pointing to 10.0.0.2.\n\n484\n00:25:01.605 --> 00:25:04.570\nNow that's assuming\nthat it's a good route.\n\n485\n00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.536\nThe computer assumes that\nwe know what we're doing.\n\n486\n00:25:06.536 --> 00:25:08.114\nIt could be a bad route though.\n\n487\n00:25:08.114 --> 00:25:10.080\nIf I'm pointing to the wrong gateway.\n\n488\n00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.902\nMaybe I needed that to go to 10.0.0.1.\n\n489\n00:25:11.902 --> 00:25:15.038\nI Pointed at 10.0.0.2,\nnow I've got a problem.\n\n490\n00:25:15.038 --> 00:25:19.203\n&gt;&gt; You know Don, we had a great question\ncome in off of our Facebook Live feed\n\n491\n00:25:19.203 --> 00:25:23.642\nthat said with these routes, Don,\nif I power cycle the router, don't those\n\n492\n00:25:23.642 --> 00:25:27.830\nroutes get removed from the routing\ntable once the router comes back on?\n\n493\n00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:28.656\nWe had a question about that.\n\n494\n00:25:28.656 --> 00:25:31.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well again, it comes down\nto how they're entered in, right?\n\n495\n00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:36.390\nIf it's a Cisco router or Juniper\nrouter and you put a route in like this\n\n496\n00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.710\nif you don't save the config if you\nreboot you lose the route, right?\n\n497\n00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:43.400\nOn a desktop or a server like this,\nit's gonna come down to that command.\n\n498\n00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:47.470\nWhen I put it in, I didn't do a -p,\nI didn't make it persistent.\n\n499\n00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:51.500\nSo if I were to rerun that\ncommand throw a -p on it, so\n\n500\n00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.930\nI think I need to do it here yeah there.\n\n501\n00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.320\nI run it.\nNow it's persistent.\n\n502\n00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.390\nNow even if I reboot that route's\ngoing to stay there okay?\n\n503\n00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.560\nAnd so if I put a bad route in,\nthat's gonna cause a problem.\n\n504\n00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.510\nSo when we use the route print\ncommand under Windows or under Linux,\n\n505\n00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:09.230\nyou use the netstat-r right?\n\n506\n00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:11.860\nThat's kind of what got\nme on this whole topic.\n\n507\n00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.120\nIf I do netstat-r,\nI can look at that routing table and\n\n508\n00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.530\nif I see something weird in there,\nI might need to go and override that and\n\n509\n00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.278\nget it out, change that configuration and\nfix things the way they are.\n\n510\n00:26:20.278 --> 00:26:25.670\nAll right, the netstat command was\nthe next thing I needed to talk about.\n\n511\n00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:26.610\nAnd actually, looking at the clock,\n\n512\n00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:28.785\nI'm kind of a little low\non time to talk about it.\n\n513\n00:26:28.785 --> 00:26:32.260\nNetstat does a heck of a lot more\nthan just show a routing table.\n\n514\n00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.090\nIt's not even it's original purpose.\n\n515\n00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.570\nSo I want to talk about netstat some more.\n\n516\n00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:39.218\nI've got nbtstat to talk about and netuse.\n\n517\n00:26:39.218 --> 00:26:41.130\nA few other commands we need to deal with.\n\n518\n00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:43.990\nAnd then physical property, we're\ngonna talk about physical cabling too.\n\n519\n00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:47.540\nSo I think we've got a part three\nin our future on this one Wes,\n\n520\n00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.320\nis that gonna be all right?\n\n521\n00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:48.820\n&gt;&gt; Hey, that sounds great.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n522\n00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:49.412\n&gt;&gt; In fact,\n\n523\n00:26:49.412 --> 00:26:54.154\nas long as you don't mention the new\ncabling standard that I've invented,\n\n524\n00:26:54.154 --> 00:26:56.550\nthat 568W, that's for sure.\n\n525\n00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:57.990\nWell, Don, you've already mentioned it.\n\n526\n00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.010\nIt does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n527\n00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:03.220\nBut before we sign out, do you have\nanything else you might like to throw\n\n528\n00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.460\ninto this episode for our viewers?\n\n529\n00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.740\nMost of the scenarios I've laid out for\nyou is pretty uncommon.\n\n530\n00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.849\nIt's pretty uncommon to have a bad\nroute in your routing table.\n\n531\n00:27:09.849 --> 00:27:12.400\nIt can happen, but it's pretty uncommon.\n\n532\n00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.741\nSo usually it's gonna be\nsomething far simpler.\n\n533\n00:27:14.741 --> 00:27:16.150\nit's gonna be a loose network cable.\n\n534\n00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:19.030\nIt's gonna be a firewall\nmisconfigured on the network.\n\n535\n00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.740\nIt's gonna be some down stream\nprovider having an outage.\n\n536\n00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.880\nSo understand that we're trying\nto cover all our bases here.\n\n537\n00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.540\nBecause these things do pop up,\nthey're just rare.\n\n538\n00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.360\nAnd so just having it somewhere in\nthe back of your mind that some of these\n\n539\n00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.240\nweird things can happen will\nhelp you to isolate and\n\n540\n00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.330\nfind those problems in event that they do.\n\n541\n00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:36.940\n&gt;&gt; Well very good Don, thank you for\nbeing here in the studio with us.\n\n542\n00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.670\nAnd thank you to you the viewer watching.\n\n543\n00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.160\nWe hope you've enjoyed the show.\n\n544\n00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.486\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n545\n00:27:41.486 --> 00:27:42.861\nI've been your host Wes Brian.\n\n546\n00:27:42.861 --> 00:27:43.743\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n547\n00:27:43.743 --> 00:27:44.850\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n548\n00:27:44.850 -->

00:00:15.230\nWelcome back to another great\nepisode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.460\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're continuing through our\n\n5\n00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.280\nseries in CompTIA Server Plus SK00004 and\n\n6\n00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.170\njoining us in the studio is again,\nis none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.018\nDon, how are you doing, sir?\n\n8\n00:00:26.018 --> 00:00:27.200\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well, Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.320\nReady to wrap this one up.\n\n10\n00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.160\nWe've got a couple of, just a little\nbit of tidbits to tackle on the network\n\n11\n00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.188\ntroubleshooting side to make sure that\nwe are objective complete for the exam.\n\n12\n00:00:34.188 --> 00:00:36.820\nBut also that we have\nthe right tools in our toolbox\n\n13\n00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.890\nto be able to troubleshoot\nnetworking issues in the workplace.\n\n14\n00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.780\nSo let's dive right back into it.\n\n15\n00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.970\nI wanna start off with some weird things.\n\n16\n00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.880\nNetBIOS.\n\n17\n00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.890\nNow when I say NetBIOS,\nI normally get the look from Wes,\n\n18\n00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.770\nlike Don why are we talking\nabout a 25 year old technology?\n\n19\n00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.948\nBack in the day, all right,\nlet's go all the way back to Windows 3.1.\n\n20\n00:00:57.948 --> 00:01:00.742\nWindows 3.1 had no networking in it.\n\n21\n00:01:00.742 --> 00:01:01.674\nZero.\n\n22\n00:01:01.674 --> 00:01:06.373\nBut you could pay a little extra and\nget Windows 3.11 for work groups, and\n\n23\n00:01:06.373 --> 00:01:07.610\nit had networking.\n\n24\n00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.303\nIt had some TCP IP as well as some NetBUI\ntechnology built in the background so\n\n25\n00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:14.548\nthat it could talk to other\nworkstations that were on the network.\n\n26\n00:01:14.548 --> 00:01:15.640\nAnd you could share files.\n\n27\n00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.810\nIt's great!\n\n28\n00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.730\nWe're talking probably 1990 was\nwhen this was really all happening.\n\n29\n00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.790\nSo a long, long, long time ago.\n\n30\n00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.970\nWell in today's world we don't\nreally use that anymore.\n\n31\n00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.880\nWe use TCP/IP and\nwe have standard protocols.\n\n32\n00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.680\nRight, it's all nice and new.\n\n33\n00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.080\nWell a lot of those old protocols were\ncarried over into the TCP/IP world and\n\n34\n00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.130\neven though we're using things like\nDNS and TCP and multicast, you still\n\n35\n00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.270\nhave some of that underlying technology\nfrom the olden days right in your system.\n\n36\n00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.027\nIf you have a Windows file server,\nor if you have a Linux Samba server,\n\n37\n00:01:52.027 --> 00:01:56.948\nyou're sharing files, and\nyou're sharing files using the SIFS format\n\n38\n00:01:56.948 --> 00:02:01.167\nthat come in internet file service,\nI'm gonna say it twice.\n\n39\n00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:03.802\nSo you're using it to share things out,\nand\n\n40\n00:02:03.802 --> 00:02:06.803\nit's all built off this\nold NetBIOS technology.\n\n41\n00:02:06.803 --> 00:02:10.554\nAnd so, occasionally, you might run into\na situation where you need to troubleshoot\n\n42\n00:02:10.554 --> 00:02:12.190\nusing some of the older tools.\n\n43\n00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.845\nThere's really just two that\nwe need to worry about.\n\n44\n00:02:13.845 --> 00:02:16.330\nAnd so I wanna show you guys those.\n\n45\n00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.300\nIt's a little bit hard to demonstrate\nbecause our networks don't\n\n46\n00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.330\nrun the same way that they used to.\n\n47\n00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.980\nNowadays if I wanna talk to Wes' computer,\nI don't send out some giant\n\n48\n00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.250\nbroadcast across the whole network to try\nand find Wes' computer and start talking.\n\n49\n00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.500\nInstead I do a DNS lookup\nto get his IP address.\n\n50\n00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.250\nI might have to do an ARP broadcast\nto find his Mac address, but\n\n51\n00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.130\nusually we've already seen\nit on the network, and\n\n52\n00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.370\nthen I can talk directly to them,\nand not mess with anybody else.\n\n53\n00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.500\nVersus things like NetBUI, and those older\ntechnologies where they would broadcast\n\n54\n00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.270\nout for darn near anything, and\ntry and find people in the network and\n\n55\n00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.520\nstart talking, because networks\nwere much smaller back then.\n\n56\n00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.580\nThose protocols weren't efficient.\n\n57\n00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.190\nBut if you're still using\nNetBIOS in any form.\n\n58\n00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.820\nWell you need to be able to troubleshoot.\n\n59\n00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.240\nNow some people are using NetBIOS and\nthey don't even realize it.\n\n60\n00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.530\nThey think well I'm running\nall Windows Server 2016 and\n\n61\n00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.990\nall my clients are Windows 10.\n\n62\n00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.570\nYeah I've got some Linux boxes but\n\n63\n00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.070\nthey're all running Samba\nin a full DNS environment.\n\n64\n00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.610\nI don't use NetBIOS.\n\n65\n00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.850\nWell you might not.\n\n66\n00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.370\nYou don't have to.\n\n67\n00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.190\nYou certainly could be using\nentirely name lookup systems.\n\n68\n00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.743\nBut if you do any single name lookups,\nwhen you browse across the network to\n\n69\n00:03:17.743 --> 00:03:22.513\na server and you use a single name to\nreference it, then you are using NetBIOS,\n\n70\n00:03:22.513 --> 00:03:25.068\nyou are using a communication like that.\n\n71\n00:03:25.068 --> 00:03:27.270\nAnd so those happen a lot.\n\n72\n00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.000\nIf you ever find yourself pulling up\na run prompt and browsing to a server.\n\n73\n00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.050\nIf you do a \\\\fileserver and press Enter.\n\n74\n00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.160\nYou're technically using NetBIOS.\n\n75\n00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.884\nYou're using NetBIOS over TCP/IP but\nyou are using NetBIOS.\n\n76\n00:03:39.884 --> 00:03:44.960\nIf you do //fileserver.domain.com,\nnow it's a different story.\n\n77\n00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.690\nNow we're doing a DNS lookup,\nwe can go right to that person.\n\n78\n00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.210\nBut even then Windows will still\nlike to use NetBIOS for some things.\n\n79\n00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.150\nSo if I'm trying to reach out and\nconnect to a server using NetBIOS, and\n\n80\n00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.050\nit's not working,\ntroubleshooting with ping and\n\n81\n00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.660\nother utilities isn't really going to\nhelp me cuz they're not using NetBIOS.\n\n82\n00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.880\nSo we still have some utilities that\nare available to troubleshoot that.\n\n83\n00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.430\nAnd unlike the other ones where I showed\nyou guys stuff on Windows and Linux,\n\n84\n00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.040\nI'm just gonna stick with Windows because\nIf you're using NetBIOS under Linux,\n\n85\n00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.680\nyou're missing the whole point of Linux.\n\n86\n00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.460\nYou should be using NFS or\nsome other file system, or\n\n87\n00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.430\neven SIFs but\nthrough regular TCP/IP communications.\n\n88\n00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.210\nNot through NetBIOS.\n\n89\n00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.770\nBut in Windows, there is two\ncommands that are really handy.\n\n90\n00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.920\nOne is Nbtstat.\n\n91\n00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.350\nNbtstat is just like the Netstat command.\n\n92\n00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.956\nNetstat shows us all\nthe TCP/IP communications and\n\n93\n00:04:31.956 --> 00:04:33.970\nUDP/IP communications that\nare going on in my system.\n\n94\n00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.770\nI can see what ports are open and\ncommunicating, and so on.\n\n95\n00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.330\nNbtstat can do the same thing.\n\n96\n00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.890\nIt can show us information\nabout our adapters.\n\n97\n00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.630\nIt can show us the names for our local\nsystem as far as NetBIOS is concerned.\n\n98\n00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.000\nAnd more importantly it\ncan show us our sessions.\n\n99\n00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.260\nAll the sessions that are out\nthere based on either a name or\n\n100\n00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.810\nan IP that we're communicating\nto using NetBIOS right now.\n\n101\n00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.255\n&gt;&gt; Don, I know that in Unix and\nLinux you've got a lot of experience, so\n\n102\n00:05:00.255 --> 00:05:02.635\nthis isn't gonna be\nsomething shocking to you.\n\n103\n00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:06.145\nBut in the Windows world, we're not\nreally used to a case sensitivity.\n\n104\n00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:08.775\nCan you help me out with\nthat on Nbtstat because I'm\n\n105\n00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:11.865\nlooking at some of those letters, and\nI'm not seeing everything lowercased.\n\n106\n00:05:11.865 --> 00:05:13.345\n&gt;&gt; Why are there two s's?\n\n107\n00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:17.015\nWell so if you look at -s,\nthere's two different variations.\n\n108\n00:05:17.015 --> 00:05:19.330\nThey both list sessions, right?\n\n109\n00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.600\nBut see how the top one says lists\nsessions table with the destination\n\n110\n00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.370\nIP address.\n\n111\n00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.200\nAnd the other one says list session\ntables converting the destination IP.\n\n112\n00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.130\nConverting to what?\n\n113\n00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.310\nWell converting to the NetBIOS names.\n\n114\n00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.350\nNow that sounds convenient, like ooh,\ninstead of IPs, I'm gonna see names?\n\n115\n00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.590\nThat's pretty handy.\n\n116\n00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.300\nBut the problem is that\nconversion can take a while.\n\n117\n00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.550\nIf you've got a large network and this\nfile server has hundreds of connections or\n\n118\n00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.420\nthousands of connections, it can take\na while to resolve all those names.\n\n119\n00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.270\nSo we can do a capital S and this command\nwill run near instantaneous, right?\n\n120\n00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.125\nI'll get my connections back which I'm\nnot going to have any cuz I'm not using\n\n121\n00:05:51.125 --> 00:05:51.720\nNetBIOS.\n\n122\n00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.310\nBut if I do a lowercase s,\n\n123\n00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.080\nit might take longer as it has to resolve\nthose hosts that are out there and so on.\n\n124\n00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.630\nSo if I were to start a NetBIOS\ncommunication, like let me\n\n125\n00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.930\nsee if I can browse to, who was on\nthe network that I could even browse to?\n\n126\n00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.360\nThis is where it gets challenging\nis having older hosts that you can\n\n127\n00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.400\nconnect to this way.\n\n128\n00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.210\nSo maybe here,\nI wanna connect to one of our ISO Shares,\n\n129\n00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.630\nwhich I'll have to log in to.\n\n130\n00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.970\nWhich hopefully I remember a name.\n\n131\n00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:19.820\nThere we go.\n\n132\n00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.550\nSo I'm browsing and connecting.\n\n133\n00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.260\nWhen I reach out to that system.\n\n134\n00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.410\nShoot, I'm the client not the server,\ncuz I'm connected that way.\n\n135\n00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.450\nI'd have to connect back.\n\n136\n00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.300\nWell either way, you can connect now,\nand you'll see that session and\n\n137\n00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.080\nresolve it based on name, or based on IP.\n\n138\n00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.840\nSo you can see what's going on.\n\n139\n00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.760\nI'm not seeing it here because I'm\nnot the server, I'm the client,\n\n140\n00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.710\nI'm connecting somewhere else.\n\n141\n00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:39.521\nI got it backwards.\n\n142\n00:06:39.521 --> 00:06:41.307\nBut you can take a look at\nthis on the server, and\n\n143\n00:06:41.307 --> 00:06:43.014\nyou can see how many\nclients are connecting.\n\n144\n00:06:43.014 --> 00:06:46.640\nIf nobody is connecting to you\nthen there might be a problem.\n\n145\n00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.710\nBut if you get a call from one user and\nthey can't connect,\n\n146\n00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.710\nwhen you see 100 other\nusers are connected.\n\n147\n00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.660\nWell you can say not the server,\nthis one person is having a problem and\n\n148\n00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.242\ncan't connect, and\nyou start to establish that scope.\n\n149\n00:06:58.242 --> 00:07:00.770\nSo Nbtstat is good for\nestablishing a scope and\n\n150\n00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.190\nfiguring out who all is affected,\nall right.\n\n151\n00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.460\nAnother command we can use is a second\nago I was just trying to find a Netbios\n\n152\n00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.250\nserver somebody that I can connect\nto that way on the network.\n\n153\n00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.378\nThere's the net command.\n\n154\n00:07:12.378 --> 00:07:16.340\nUnder the NetBIOS world, when you\nwould map to a network drive like this\n\n155\n00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.250\nISO folder that I just\nbrowsed to on storage one.\n\n156\n00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.820\nIf I wanted to map that to a drive letter,\nlike to the I drive,\n\n157\n00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:28.460\nI could say netuse and use the netuse\ncommand to mount and connect to somebody.\n\n158\n00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.194\nAnd see how it shows that I've\nalready mounted the \\\\storage01\\ISO?\n\n159\n00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.320\nIt's not assigned a drive letter,\nbut I am connected to it.\n\n160\n00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.770\nSo it's showing me the connections\nthat I have established.\n\n161\n00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.820\nSo on the client side,\nthe net use command is a little bit more\n\n162\n00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.260\nuseful than the nbtstat command is,\nwhich is more useful on the server side.\n\n163\n00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.180\nThere's also the netshow command.\n\n164\n00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.660\nNetshow will scan the network, and\n\n165\n00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.790\nshow you any other NetBIOS\nhosts that are out there.\n\n166\n00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.238\nSo when I was trying to guess one,\nI could have run net show and\n\n167\n00:07:56.238 --> 00:07:57.830\nit would have reached out to find some.\n\n168\n00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.110\nAnd sorry, not net show.\n\n169\n00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.640\nNetview.\n\n170\n00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.130\nThere we go, it helps if you can get the\ncommand right, that'll make a difference.\n\n171\n00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.040\nSo I'll do netview.\n\n172\n00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.943\nIt'll scan the network, and this one's\ngonna take a minute cuz it's looking for\n\n173\n00:08:08.943 --> 00:08:10.560\nother hosts that are out there.\n\n174\n00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.599\nFirewalls can block this, other things can\nstop this communication from working but\n\n175\n00:08:14.599 --> 00:08:15.777\nit should reach out, and\n\n176\n00:08:15.777 --> 00:08:19.670\nat a minimum I should get storage01 cuz\nI connected to that one a minute ago.\n\n177\n00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.400\nWell actually network path not found,\nsystem error 53 has occurred.\n\n178\n00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.180\nSystem error 53.\n\n179\n00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.866\nWhat is that?\n\n180\n00:08:25.866 --> 00:08:27.220\nWell, I'd have to look that up.\n\n181\n00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.675\nActually, I know this one,\nbecause it's DNS.\n\n182\n00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:31.500\nIt tried to do a DNS resolution for\na name, and it failed.\n\n183\n00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.030\nI just know that because DNS uses port 53,\n\n184\n00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.500\nand they made the error number\nmatch because it was 53.\n\n185\n00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.190\nOtherwise, I wouldn't have\nknown what that was, and\n\n186\n00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.060\nwe'd have to look it up and find out.\n\n187\n00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.160\nSo these are just a couple of\nutilities that are available if you're\n\n188\n00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.220\ntroubleshooting NetBIOS type issues.\n\n189\n00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.350\nNot very common any more.\n\n190\n00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.520\nMost of us aren't using\nthis in our network.\n\n191\n00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.030\nAnd if you are and it fails,\nit usually just flips over and\n\n192\n00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.220\nuses regular TCP/IP lookups.\n\n193\n00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.180\nSo you NetBIOS over TCP/IP.\n\n194\n00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.520\nAnd that's it.\n\n195\n00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.180\nIt is not a big deal.\n\n196\n00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.160\nBut these commands are available,\nyou can use them for\n\n197\n00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.520\ntroubleshooting and they are there.\n\n198\n00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.410\nNow, if we're not using NetBIOS\nthen we're using other protocols.\n\n199\n00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.150\nAnd all the other protocols,\n\n200\n00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.470\nwe can troubleshoot with\na utility called Netstat.\n\n201\n00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.110\nSo like Nbtstat,\nNetstat is far more useful.\n\n202\n00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.760\nAnd so if I troubleshoot a server,\nusually Netstat's the one I'm gonna go to.\n\n203\n00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.730\nI've got this server up and running,\nand what kind of server is it?\n\n204\n00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:20.890\nIs it a web server?\n\n205\n00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.390\nIs it a FTP server?\n\n206\n00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.530\nIs it an email server?\n\n207\n00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.660\nWhat is it?\n\n208\n00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.654\nIt might be an email server.\n\n209\n00:09:25.654 --> 00:09:27.668\nAll right, well, if it's an email server,\n\n210\n00:09:27.668 --> 00:09:30.610\nI should be communicating on port 25 for\nSMTP.\n\n211\n00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.870\nI should be communicating on port 110 for\nPOP3, or 143 for IMAP.\n\n212\n00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.320\nIs the server doing that?\n\n213\n00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.010\nIs it running that way?\n\n214\n00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.720\nThe netstat command can tell you.\n\n215\n00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.080\nNetstat is really used for\nour brand new Linux servers.\n\n216\n00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.640\nYou bring up a brand new Linux server and\nyou're like, all right time to harden\n\n217\n00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.008\nthe server, I need to turn off\nany servers I'm not using.\n\n218\n00:09:47.008 --> 00:09:49.200\nWhat services am I using?\n\n219\n00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.640\nYou can use the netstat command and\n\n220\n00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.530\nit'll show you all the ports\nthat you're listening on.\n\n221\n00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.410\nA server listens, it waits for\npeople to connect to it.\n\n222\n00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.230\nAnd it's gonna listen on the ports for\neach of its services.\n\n223\n00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.695\nIf it's a web server,\nit'll be listening on port 80 and 443.\n\n224\n00:10:02.695 --> 00:10:06.400\nIf it's an email server,\nit'll listen on ports 25 and 110 and 143,\n\n225\n00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.970\neach of the ports that\nare involved in that.\n\n226\n00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.340\nNetstat will show us.\n\n227\n00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.500\nNow, if you just run the netstat command\nby itself, it's gonna take a while, right.\n\n228\n00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.499\nIt's sitting here.\n\n229\n00:10:15.499 --> 00:10:18.520\nAnd that's because by default\nit's resolving IPs to name.\n\n230\n00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.810\nSee how I've got Macbook Pro-ODE1.\n\n231\n00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.871\nI don't know who that is,\nbut somebody's Macbook.\n\n232\n00:10:25.871 --> 00:10:28.300\nIt's trying to figure out these names.\n\n233\n00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.970\nAnd that takes a while, so\nI'm gonna break out of that and\n\n234\n00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.313\nI'm gonna run netstat -an, okay?\n\n235\n00:10:33.313 --> 00:10:37.160\nThe n is telling it not to bother with the\nnames, and the a is telling it I wanna see\n\n236\n00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.970\nall connections,\neven ones that have idled out, right?\n\n237\n00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.440\nI like to see everything.\n\n238\n00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.190\nAnd see how fast that command ran?\n\n239\n00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.880\nAnd now I can see everything\nthat my server is doing.\n\n240\n00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.820\nAnd what I'm gonna see are a bunch\nof LISTENING connections.\n\n241\n00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.050\nAs a server, the LISTENING connections\n\n242\n00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:57.950\nare the ones that map to some kind\nof service that I'm providing.\n\n243\n00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.770\nAll right, so\nwhat services am I providing?\n\n244\n00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.239\nIf I look at the list\nthe very first one is 135.\n\n245\n00:11:02.239 --> 00:11:03.458\nWhat is 135?\n\n246\n00:11:03.458 --> 00:11:05.987\nWell, that's file sharing in Windows.\n\n247\n00:11:05.987 --> 00:11:07.636\nThen I see 445.\n\n248\n00:11:07.636 --> 00:11:08.669\nWhat is 445?\n\n249\n00:11:08.669 --> 00:11:10.730\nI probably have to look those up.\n\n250\n00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.030\nI pretty sure that's the secure\nfile sharing in Windows.\n\n251\n00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.854\nDo you know Wes?\n445?\n\n252\n00:11:13.854 --> 00:11:16.919\n&gt;&gt; No, I think it's Microsoft-DS service.\n\n253\n00:11:16.919 --> 00:11:18.290\n&gt;&gt; The directory service?\n\n254\n00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:18.950\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure.\n\n255\n00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.410\nI have to check.\n\n256\n00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.240\n&gt;&gt; Again, a good example,\nif I don't recognize a port,\n\n257\n00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.330\nI need to go and look that up.\n\n258\n00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:24.630\nShould I be running this?\n\n259\n00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.270\nMaybe not, right?\n\n260\n00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.950\nI mean it could be the net login\nservers talking to a domain controller.\n\n261\n00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.380\n&gt;&gt; SMB over IP.\n\n262\n00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.160\n&gt;&gt; SMB, server message block,\nwhich is used for file sharing, right.\n\n263\n00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.330\nSo this is a part of file sharing.\n\n264\n00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:36.508\nGood, I guessed right.\n\n265\n00:11:36.508 --> 00:11:38.960\n3389, that's remote desktop.\n\n266\n00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.340\nI'm listening on port 3389 and\n\n267\n00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:44.530\nsee how many 0's, this server\nmight have five network adapters.\n\n268\n00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:48.010\nAll the 0's means I'm listing\non all five network adapters.\n\n269\n00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:53.940\nDown here I see sessions like 139 and\nit's got an IP 10.02.222.223.\n\n270\n00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.540\nI'm only listening on\nport 139 on that one IP.\n\n271\n00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.120\nNot on any other network\nadapters that I might have.\n\n272\n00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.760\nSo I can see what I'm listing\non to determine what I'm doing.\n\n273\n00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.400\nNotice all these other\ncrazy ports down here.\n\n274\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.900\nWhat are these?\n\n275\n00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.030\nI have no idea.\n\n276\n00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.630\nOnce you get over 1024,\nyou get into the registered port range.\n\n277\n00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.180\nAnd registered ports don't\nactually have to be registered.\n\n278\n00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.280\nThey're just called that.\n\n279\n00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.990\nAnd then once you get over 49,152,\nis that right, Wes?\n\n280\n00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:20.409\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Wes got my back.\n\n281\n00:12:20.409 --> 00:12:22.996\nAnd once you get over 49,152,\n\n282\n00:12:22.996 --> 00:12:27.510\nthen you're getting into random\nports that are unassigned.\n\n283\n00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.175\nThese can be anything.\n\n284\n00:12:29.175 --> 00:12:31.035\nTypically these are replies.\n\n285\n00:12:31.035 --> 00:12:33.935\nI'm reaching out to some other host and\nI have to listen on this port for\n\n286\n00:12:33.935 --> 00:12:36.125\nthe reply coming back from the host,\nall right?\n\n287\n00:12:36.125 --> 00:12:38.935\nNow, this is my server and I'm running\na couple of different programs on\n\n288\n00:12:38.935 --> 00:12:40.465\nhere that use different ports like 5985.\n\n289\n00:12:40.465 --> 00:12:43.005\nThat's a part of a program\nthat I'm running.\n\n290\n00:12:43.005 --> 00:12:44.435\nSo I know what some of these are.\n\n291\n00:12:44.435 --> 00:12:45.985\nBut you're not gonna have these.\n\n292\n00:12:45.985 --> 00:12:47.635\nYou're gonna have different\nones that match up with\n\n293\n00:12:47.635 --> 00:12:49.690\nthe applications that\nyour server's providing.\n\n294\n00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:53.863\nDon, I noticed in that big laundry\nlist of IP addresses in netstat.\n\n295\n00:12:53.863 --> 00:12:55.480\nThere's a bunch with asterisks in there.\n\n296\n00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.470\nCan you help us out with those, the ones\nthat are down there closer to the bottom?\n\n297\n00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.915\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, as we browse down, you're gonna\nsee a lot of independent communications.\n\n298\n00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:06.860\nSo see I've got all these other\nsystems like 10.0.14.71, 10.0.14.93,\n\n299\n00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.840\n10.0.14.226, all connected\nto me on port 17500, right?\n\n300\n00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.750\nI know exactly what that communication is.\n\n301\n00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.110\nThis server is managing\na Hyper-V environment.\n\n302\n00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.305\nAnd so, those are all connections to\ndifferent virtual machines in that\n\n303\n00:13:19.305 --> 00:13:20.100\nHyper-V environment.\n\n304\n00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.930\nSo they're all kinda showing\nup here as connected.\n\n305\n00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.950\nBut as I keep going down.\n\n306\n00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:25.728\nWell, then we get IPv6.\n\n307\n00:13:25.728 --> 00:13:27.960\nAnd then we start getting asterisks.\n\n308\n00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.190\nThese wildcards, okay?\n\n309\n00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:32.370\nWhat's that all about?\n\n310\n00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:36.520\nWell if you look at these,\nthey're UDP communications, right?\n\n311\n00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.850\nRemember with TCP,\nI actually build up a session.\n\n312\n00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.750\nI connect to another person, I send\nthem a packet, and if they don't get it\n\n313\n00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.090\nthey send a retransmit message to me, so\nI can send it back to them, I can retry.\n\n314\n00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.330\nBut with UDP, I don't care.\n\n315\n00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.500\nUDP, I just throw it out there.\n\n316\n00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.040\nHere you go, take this.\n\n317\n00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.050\nAnd if they get it, great.\n\n318\n00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.100\nIf they don't get it, great.\n\n319\n00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.690\nI just keep moving, right.\n\n320\n00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.655\nAnd so\nwith all these UDP sessions down here,\n\n321\n00:13:56.655 --> 00:14:02.245\nome of these are things like UDP\n3399 remote desktop protocol.\n\n322\n00:14:02.245 --> 00:14:04.795\nI'm remoted into this server and\nit's just throwing the screens at me.\n\n323\n00:14:04.795 --> 00:14:07.015\nAnd if I miss one of the screen images,\n\n324\n00:14:07.015 --> 00:14:12.115\nI just move past it because I don't want\nmy mouse to freeze and then move forward.\n\n325\n00:14:12.115 --> 00:14:14.405\nI just want my mouse to disappear for\na second and move forward, right?\n\n326\n00:14:14.405 --> 00:14:15.985\nSo it just kind of leaps forward in time.\n\n327\n00:14:15.985 --> 00:14:17.825\nSo it's as close to real time as possible.\n\n328\n00:14:17.825 --> 00:14:18.995\nThat's the way that one works.\n\n329\n00:14:18.995 --> 00:14:21.470\nSo you're gonna see those\ncommunications down here at the end.\n\n330\n00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:22.900\nAnd it's not a session.\n\n331\n00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.820\nIt's not an established session\nwith sequence numbers and\n\n332\n00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.880\nthat's why the destination\nis shown as an asterisk.\n\n333\n00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.080\nThe destination is my laptop.\n\n334\n00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.780\nThere is an actual destination.\n\n335\n00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.800\nBut it doesn't show here, because\nthere's not a true session in place.\n\n336\n00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.330\nThat's why we have the asterisks.\n\n337\n00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.830\nAll right, so netstat really handy,\nit's used under Linux too.\n\n338\n00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.060\nSo if I go back to my Red Hat server and\n\n339\n00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.130\nI fire this up and do netstat,\nwe'll see the same thing.\n\n340\n00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:48.670\nThe output might look a little different\nbecause Linux servers are better about\n\n341\n00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.530\nlisting all the services that are running.\n\n342\n00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.760\nBut if I scroll all the way\nto the top of this thing.\n\n343\n00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.490\nWell this server's actually not\nreally talking to anybody, is it?\n\n344\n00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:03.270\nLooking at it here, there's just this\none connection up here at the top.\n\n345\n00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:07.015\nWhere I've got dpLaptop.Lab\nis connected to\n\n346\n00:15:07.015 --> 00:15:11.450\ndarwin.kenyanralph.whatever, what\nthe heck is that?\n\n347\n00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.670\nSometimes when you run open\nsource software, this is Red Hat.\n\n348\n00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:20.600\nI'm connected out to maybe a network\ntime server, if I'm using an ntp.org.\n\n349\n00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.740\nAnd you'll connect to hosts that\nhave weird names like that.\n\n350\n00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.830\nAnd I'm like what the heck is that,\nI have no idea who that is.\n\n351\n00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.670\nBut I can see here NTP,\nnetwork time protocol.\n\n352\n00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.725\nWhen you connect to ntp.org, it's a pool\nof time servers around the world and\n\n353\n00:15:30.725 --> 00:15:32.404\nyou might not recognize those host names.\n\n354\n00:15:32.404 --> 00:15:37.080\nBut it does flag you a little warning\nthere to say, I need to find that out.\n\n355\n00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:37.600\nIs that okay?\n\n356\n00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.770\nShould I be talking to that host?\n\n357\n00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.860\nAnd we can look, but\nif I were to open up a different session.\n\n358\n00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:46.934\nLet me, for example,\nif I browse to ITPro.tv.\n\n359\n00:15:46.934 --> 00:15:51.410\nSo I will fire up a web browser and\nI'll go to.\n\n360\n00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.140\nWell there's Red Hat,\nI'll leave that webpage open.\n\n361\n00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.775\nAnd we'll browse to itpro.tv.\n\n362\n00:15:56.775 --> 00:16:02.400\nSo I am just gonna open up that webpage\nand I'll re-run that netstat command.\n\n363\n00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.854\nLook at all those connections\nthat were just created.\n\n364\n00:16:05.854 --> 00:16:07.640\nNow you guys saw what I just did.\n\n365\n00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.610\nI launched Firefox and\nI effectively opened two web pages.\n\n366\n00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.680\nI opened ITPRO.TV and I opened Redhat.\n\n367\n00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.280\nSo what happened?\n\n368\n00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:16.840\nMy goodness.\n\n369\n00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.290\nLook at all of this.\n\n370\n00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:18.900\nRight?\n\n371\n00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.260\nWell some of this is ITPRO.TV.\n\n372\n00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.580\nSome of this is redhat.\n\n373\n00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.270\nWhat's going on.\n\n374\n00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:24.510\nActually I just saw ITPRO.TV\nwe're the cloud proxy.\n\n375\n00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:26.050\nWe're that guy right there.\n\n376\n00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:27.460\nWhat's all this other stuff?\n\n377\n00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.440\nWhere's all this coming from?\n\n378\n00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.930\nWell, when you browse to a webpage,\nthat webpage\n\n379\n00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.980\nusually has elements from a number of\ndifferent providers that are in there.\n\n380\n00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.120\nThe ads might be launched from one place.\n\n381\n00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.482\nThe images might be stored somewhere.\n\n382\n00:16:37.482 --> 00:16:40.470\nSo ITPRO.TV,\nyou get our webpage from this cloud proxy.\n\n383\n00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.480\nBut then our images come out of Amazon S3.\n\n384\n00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.940\nSo somewhere in here we'll\nsee some Amazon S3 stuff.\n\n385\n00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.330\nHere's some EC2 servers for\n\n386\n00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.190\nAmazon hosted servers that are out there,\nthere's s3 right there.\n\n387\n00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.000\nSo, at least one of those, probably\nboth of those are gonna be ITPRO.TV\n\n388\n00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.930\nservers cuz our images\nare coming out of that.\n\n389\n00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.010\nSo you can start to see all the different\nconnections that you've got.\n\n390\n00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.340\nAnd use that for troubleshooting,\nverifying whether or\n\n391\n00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.490\nnot people are able to even show up here,\nbetter yet, connect to your service.\n\n392\n00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.790\nAll right, so, neat command, nets that,\nshows you a wealth of information.\n\n393\n00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:14.760\nAnd it has a ton of command line flags\nthat you can change it's behavior and\n\n394\n00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.150\nmake it do all sorts of crazy things.\n\n395\n00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.500\nSo definitely take a look at that if\nyou ever get bored and have a moment.\n\n396\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:24.450\nAlright the last thing that I want to talk\nabout is not a software but hardware.\n\n397\n00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.500\nYou can have physical failed components.\n\n398\n00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.410\nI talked about network adaptors\nin the last episode and\n\n399\n00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.570\nyou can swap those out in most scenarios.\n\n400\n00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:34.168\nBut failed cables are pretty common,\nright?\n\n401\n00:17:34.168 --> 00:17:36.680\nWhat are some of the the things\nthat can cause a cable to fail?\n\n402\n00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.290\nWell I've got a few different things\nhere that I wanna show you guys.\n\n403\n00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:40.660\nSo I'm gonna bring these up.\n\n404\n00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:46.615\nBut the number one most common thing that\ncauses a cable to fail is the connector.\n\n405\n00:17:46.615 --> 00:17:49.975\nA lot of our cables are using RJ-45\nplugs and the design is okay but\n\n406\n00:17:49.975 --> 00:17:51.005\nit's not perfect.\n\n407\n00:17:51.005 --> 00:17:52.365\nSo if we take a look at this cable, for\n\n408\n00:17:52.365 --> 00:17:57.095\nexample, what I've got here is\na standard RJ-45 connection and\n\n409\n00:17:57.095 --> 00:18:03.080\nit's got eight copper wires in it and\na little tab and that tab's purpose is\n\n410\n00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:07.410\nto hold it in the slot when I plug it into\na network adaptor, that tab right there.\n\n411\n00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:11.020\nWell those tabs break off really,\nreally easy.\n\n412\n00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.860\nIf you take a look at\nthe other end of this one,\n\n413\n00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.895\nit's got no tab on it because\nit snapped off at some point.\n\n414\n00:18:15.895 --> 00:18:17.885\nThat means this cable can come lose.\n\n415\n00:18:17.885 --> 00:18:20.725\nWell servers have fans,\nand fans cause vibrations.\n\n416\n00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:22.805\nAnd just the temperature\nof a server swelling and\n\n417\n00:18:22.805 --> 00:18:25.615\ncontracting each day will\nslowly work this cable out.\n\n418\n00:18:25.615 --> 00:18:26.675\nAnd it will pop out.\n\n419\n00:18:26.675 --> 00:18:29.895\nSo it's very easy to get\na cable that comes lose.\n\n420\n00:18:29.895 --> 00:18:32.545\nEven when the cable has its\nproper connections though\n\n421\n00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.260\nIt can be that it's miswired, or that\nit's wired differently than we expect.\n\n422\n00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.640\nThis orange cable for\nexample is a cross over cable.\n\n423\n00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.190\nIt's wired 5/68 a on one side,\nand 5/68 b on the other.\n\n424\n00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:44.550\nIt's a cross over.\n\n425\n00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.430\nThis is what I would use if I was\nconnecting a server to another server.\n\n426\n00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:52.110\nThis is not what I would use if I\nwas connecting a server to a switch.\n\n427\n00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.380\nSo I've got to make sure that\nmy cables are wired properly.\n\n428\n00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.510\nIt's also possible to have\na cable that's damaged somewhere.\n\n429\n00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:02.420\nSo, for example, this cable,\nmay look like a perfectly good cable,\n\n430\n00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.650\non first inspection.\n\n431\n00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.690\nBut somewhere along the cable\nthere could be damage.\n\n432\n00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:10.360\nIn this case, right here, I've got\na little bit of damage in this cable.\n\n433\n00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.000\nNow, if this is run through cable\nmanagement in a server rack\n\n434\n00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.790\nI might not see that.\n\n435\n00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:18.020\nI mean this is one little spot that\nmight be buried under plastic covers or\n\n436\n00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:18.690\nwhatever.\n\n437\n00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.870\nBundled with other cables and\nI might not spot it.\n\n438\n00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.720\nThat damage is easy to miss.\n\n439\n00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.090\nSometimes, the damage can cause a problem.\n\n440\n00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:26.790\nSometimes we can just ignore it.\n\n441\n00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:27.880\nAlright so the shielding broke.\n\n442\n00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.440\nWho cares?\n\n443\n00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.790\nRight?\nAs long as the internal wires are fine,\n\n444\n00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:32.210\nwe don't worry about it.\n\n445\n00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:36.630\nBut, it's a good idea to have\na cable tester laying around so\n\n446\n00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:37.800\nyou can test the cables.\n\n447\n00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.490\nYou can get a simple pair tester like\nthis one and they're super cheap.\n\n448\n00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:43.305\n30 maybe $40.\n\n449\n00:19:43.305 --> 00:19:45.200\nThey're not expensive at all.\n\n450\n00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.680\nOr you can get a cable certifier.\n\n451\n00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.250\nCable certifiers usually\ncost about $2,000 and\n\n452\n00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:53.170\nwhat they do is they plug into the two\nends and they check all the pairs for\n\n453\n00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.030\nconnectivity, that's\nwhat this one's gonna do.\n\n454\n00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.920\nBut then, they send voltage\nacross the line and test how\n\n455\n00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.850\nmuch voltage they can carry and certify\nit for a certain amount of bandwidth.\n\n456\n00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:01.800\nThere's a lot of value there.\n\n457\n00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.620\nOn your servers, you need to make sure\nyour cables are able to handle gigabit or\n\n458\n00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.740\nten gig or whatever it is that\nyou're pushing over them.\n\n459\n00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.500\nA pair tester won't tell you that.\n\n460\n00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.350\nWhen you buy a factory cable,\nthey've already tested it,\n\n461\n00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.070\nthey've already certified the cable But\n\n462\n00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:19.970\nwhen you crimp your own ends on the cable,\nit's not certified anymore.\n\n463\n00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.300\nAnd so now, it's up to you to\nverify that it was done correctly.\n\n464\n00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.990\nNow, I mentioned how this one cable\nwas 568A and 568B to make a crossover.\n\n465\n00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:32.330\nWe have a joke here in\nthe studio is 568W also 568 Wes.\n\n466\n00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.940\nWhen Wes cables who knows\nwhat's gonna happen.\n\n467\n00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.780\nSo that's why we have a pair\ntester sitting right here.\n\n468\n00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.530\nAnd the way a pair tester\nworks is really simple.\n\n469\n00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.740\nYou can just take a cable like\nlike this little one here.\n\n470\n00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.210\nI'll use it.\n\n471\n00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.310\nAnd I'm gonna turn on this pair tester.\n\n472\n00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.470\nAnd what it does,\nis it starts sending out a little signal.\n\n473\n00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:56.730\nAnd if I plug one end of the cable in to\nthe pair tester and then I plug the other\n\n474\n00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:01.030\nend on the other side which apparently\nis turning out to be a bigger challenge.\n\n475\n00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.800\nThere we go.\nI'm gonna destroy this.\n\n476\n00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.510\nIt starts testing the cable.\n\n477\n00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:10.390\nAnd as you look at it what you're gonna\nsee is it's running down the pairs.\n\n478\n00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.790\nOver here on the left I just see a flash\nletting me know that it's lighting up.\n\n479\n00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:18.660\nAnd over here I should see one and\ntwo, three and six, four and\n\n480\n00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.540\nfive and seven and\neight all light up in order.\n\n481\n00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:26.660\nThis is a standard, straight through cable\nand everything is communicating just fine.\n\n482\n00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.560\nI see the light moving down the light and\nthere we go.\n\n483\n00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.910\nNow because there's no tab on one end,\n\n484\n00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:35.980\nif I start to kind of wiggle that cable\nyou can see some weird things happen.\n\n485\n00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.900\nNotice how one and two is not lighting up.\n\n486\n00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.360\nBut three, six, four, five,\nseven and eight still are.\n\n487\n00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.320\nThat cable is still plugged in.\n\n488\n00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.610\nI just pulled it out a little bit and\nI lost one pair.\n\n489\n00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.430\nAnd it's weird how it picked\njust that first pair.\n\n490\n00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.420\nNow, I just wiggled it a little more and\nonly three, six, and four and\n\n491\n00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.570\nfive are lit.\n\n492\n00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.490\nOne, and two, and seven,\nthey aren't lit any more.\n\n493\n00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:02.200\nThat's the problem when you have\na cable that no longer has a tab, and\n\n494\n00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.600\nwhy we need to replace that\ncable as soon as we find it.\n\n495\n00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.280\nIf you take a crossover cable,\nand plug it in and\n\n496\n00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.120\nrun the same test,\nthings get really weird, right.\n\n497\n00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.480\nNotice how the lights blink out of order,\nright?\n\n498\n00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.791\nInstead of one-two being\nfirst it's one-four.\n\n499\n00:22:17.791 --> 00:22:19.505\nI mean three-six is first.\n\n500\n00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:23.170\nThen one-two then four-five,\nit's going out of order.\n\n501\n00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:24.510\nThat's because it's a crossover.\n\n502\n00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:25.510\nIt's flipping over.\n\n503\n00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:29.418\nI need to expect that if it's a crossover\ncable I expect it to go out of order.\n\n504\n00:22:30.941 --> 00:22:32.667\nIf there's damage on the cable there,\n\n505\n00:22:32.667 --> 00:22:34.770\nthat's where things get\nreally interesting.\n\n506\n00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.080\nSo here's that damaged\ncable that I held up.\n\n507\n00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.060\nBasically there's one broken\nwire inside of this cable.\n\n508\n00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:46.370\nAnd so when I run the test here\nI can see one two, three six.\n\n509\n00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:51.060\nAnd then it skips 4,\n5 and goes to 7 and 8.\n\n510\n00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:55.130\nSo the pair for 4 and\n5 is no longer connected, and so\n\n511\n00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.100\nI'm not able to move\ndata through the cable.\n\n512\n00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.370\nYou have to be careful with\nthis because on a broken cable\n\n513\n00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:03.080\nyou can still get a link light.\n\n514\n00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:07.360\nYou can plug in a cable and you'll\nget a link out because you only need\n\n515\n00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:12.050\ntwo wires connected to get a link wire and\nif those wires are good, you'll get a link\n\n516\n00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:15.170\neven though the cable itself is bad and\nyou can't get all of your wires.\n\n517\n00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:19.880\n&gt;&gt; Let me see if I can set you up with the\nscenario were gonna throw a curl ball and\n\n518\n00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:24.470\nwere maybe the tester is not gonna come\nin handy as a certified as you mentioned.\n\n519\n00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:27.900\nI know that cat cables and especially as\nyou start to get into gigabit speeds they\n\n520\n00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.410\nexpect to have a certain amount\nof twist per in that cable.\n\n521\n00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:36.210\nIs there a potential if somebody gets in\nthere and they pull the cable to stretch\n\n522\n00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:41.100\nthose twists out or maybe the tester\nhere will get a continuity it'll get\n\n523\n00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.690\nthe electrical signal but we put\na certifier on it and we learn that we've\n\n524\n00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:48.320\nactually degraded the quality of\nthe cable by pulling on it too much.\n\n525\n00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.310\n&gt;&gt; Well even without pulling, right?\n\n526\n00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:52.530\nLet's say that my server\nroom has Cat5 cable in it.\n\n527\n00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.772\nNow Cat5E or Cat6 just Cat5, all right.\n\n528\n00:23:55.772 --> 00:23:58.355\nAnd a Cat5 cable can\ncarry a hundred megabits.\n\n529\n00:23:58.355 --> 00:24:02.289\nUp to a hundred meters,\n330 feet something like that.\n\n530\n00:24:02.289 --> 00:24:04.306\nWell, that's fine, it's all fine and good.\n\n531\n00:24:04.306 --> 00:24:07.661\nIf I try and\nrun gigabit over that Cat5 link and\n\n532\n00:24:07.661 --> 00:24:11.370\nit's a 100 meters long,\nit's not gonna work.\n\n533\n00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:15.190\nI'm gonna get lots of retransmits,\nlots of interference on that line.\n\n534\n00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:18.310\nIf I'll hook this tester up It's\ngonna say everything's good.\n\n535\n00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:22.090\nIt's not testing 100 megabit or\na gigabit or anything like that,\n\n536\n00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:23.490\nit's just testing the wires.\n\n537\n00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:27.360\nAnd it's signal will go fine over 100\nmeters, even on Cat3, for that matter,\n\n538\n00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.170\nit's just not gonna care.\n\n539\n00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.490\nSo this isn't gonna help\nme in that scenario.\n\n540\n00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.870\nIf I'm trying to certify speed, that's\nwhere I need to get a cable certifier, or\n\n541\n00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:37.010\none of those fluke network inspector,\nor one of those devices.\n\n542\n00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:39.140\nAnd they cost a lot of money but\nthey're worth it.\n\n543\n00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.680\nBecause they'll tell you\nhow good that cable is.\n\n544\n00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.673\nAnd if you got Cat5e or you've got Cat6,\nit'll rate it for that and\n\n545\n00:24:44.673 --> 00:24:45.610\nit'll let you know.\n\n546\n00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.500\nYeah, you can move a gig over this cable,\nno problem.\n\n547\n00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.020\nOr cable is a little too long.\n\n548\n00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.600\nIt's not gonna pass that test,\nand it's not gonna work.\n\n549\n00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.490\nSo it's a handy tool to have laying\naround because a lot of times if you're\n\n550\n00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:59.500\na dedicated sys admin and there's\na network team that's managing the network\n\n551\n00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:03.990\nYou have to take their word for it when\nthey say, yeah you're switch, it's fine.\n\n552\n00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:07.390\nYou plug into this port on the wall,\nyou'll get gigabit, no problem.\n\n553\n00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.340\nYou don't really know,\nwill you get gigabits?\n\n554\n00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.060\nSo, being able to certify that,\nand they should be doing it.\n\n555\n00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.970\nAny good network admin will be doing\nthat to make sure everything is okay.\n\n556\n00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.541\nBut just know that there are different\ntypes of testers, they test for\n\n557\n00:25:17.541 --> 00:25:18.596\ndifferent types of things.\n\n558\n00:25:18.596 --> 00:25:21.593\nAnd the more bandwidth you're\npushing on that copper wire,\n\n559\n00:25:21.593 --> 00:25:23.247\nthe more important that test is.\n\n560\n00:25:23.247 --> 00:25:26.830\nOr the more important it is to use factory\nbuilt cables instead of building your own.\n\n561\n00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.510\nWe used to crimp ends\non cables all the time.\n\n562\n00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:30.800\nBut in today's world,\n\n563\n00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.400\nI usually just do factory cables,\ncuz it's such a pain to get it done right.\n\n564\n00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.210\nThe Cat 6 cabling,\nthe ends are always a lot more tight.\n\n565\n00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:38.860\nIt's just much more difficult to do.\n\n566\n00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.360\nSo I just let the factory do it.\n\n567\n00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.480\nBut that's not always an option,\nsometimes you need to custom cut cable.\n\n568\n00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.370\nIn which case you really\nneed to test that out.\n\n569\n00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.370\nYou can see some odd behavior on a server\nwhen you've got a bad network cable.\n\n570\n00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:52.420\nIt's really obvious if you fire up\na network sniffer, like Wireshark,\n\n571\n00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.770\nand you'll see a lot of\nretransmits on the network.\n\n572\n00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.590\nA lot of times where it's\nhaving to retransmit,\n\n573\n00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.570\nyou'll get negative acknowledgments\nin TCP/IP that are showing,\n\n574\n00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:02.610\nhey I didn't get this and\nI was supposed to, or failed checksums.\n\n575\n00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:06.240\nYou'll get CRC failures a lot, and\nyou can see that in a network sniffer.\n\n576\n00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.700\nYou don't really see that\nin the operating systems.\n\n577\n00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.870\nIn the Linux world you\nhave the TCPDUMP command,\n\n578\n00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:14.220\nand you can use TCPDUMP to see all\nthat stuff that's coming across.\n\n579\n00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.940\nIn the Windows world you have open\nsource software like Wireshark.\n\n580\n00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.890\nAnd then there's some closed source stuff\nlike the Network Monitor from Microsoft\n\n581\n00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:22.680\nthat hasn't been updated in a long time.\n\n582\n00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.450\nWireshark's really the best\nway to go to see that stuff.\n\n583\n00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.670\n&gt;&gt; Alright Don,\nthat's a lot of great information.\n\n584\n00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:30.510\nI know that we've been through a lot\nof different concepts there, but\n\n585\n00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:33.470\nit does look like we are coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n586\n00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:34.100\nBefore we do,\n\n587\n00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.960\ndo you have any additional words you might\nlike to let our viewers know in this one?\n\n588\n00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.840\n&gt;&gt; Main thing is, if you've got a network\nteam get them engaged to have the best\n\n589\n00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.180\ndata center possible, the network team and\nthe sys admin team need to work together.\n\n590\n00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.680\nThey need to be able to trust each other.\n\n591\n00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.550\nBut in order to ask them for help,\n\n592\n00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:51.220\nyou need to at least have\nan idea where the problem is.\n\n593\n00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.750\nSo use all the tools at your\ndisposal to try and isolate and\n\n594\n00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.170\nfigure out where that issue is before\ngoing to the network team to help them.\n\n595\n00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:00.820\nSo they can kind of dial in\nright on it and get it resolved.\n\n596\n00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.710\nBut definitely engage them\nif you are the network team.\n\n597\n00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:06.870\nIf it's a small shop and\nyou're kind of wearing more than one hat,\n\n598\n00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:10.150\nthen just don't always assume\nthe problem is the server, or\n\n599\n00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:11.540\ndon't always assume\nthe problem is the network.\n\n600\n00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.410\nIt could be either one or\n\n601\n00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.553\nit could even be both that leads\nto the problem that you've got.\n\n602\n00:27:15.553 --> 00:27:16.370\n&gt;&gt; All right Don.\n\n603\n00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:18.360\nThank you for\nbeing here in the studios with us, and\n\n604\n00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.930\nthank you to you the viewer watching.\n\n605\n00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:23.121\nSigning out for\nITProTV I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n606\n00:27:23.121 --> 00:27:23.991\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n607\n00:27:23.991

00:00:08.208\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:11.873\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.873 --> 00:00:15.024\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITPro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.024 --> 00:00:16.285\nI am your host Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:17.835\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:22.349\nwe're continuing through our series\nin CompTIA's Server plus SK004.\n\n9\n00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.161\nAnd joining us back in the studios\nagain is Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:26.329\nDon, how are you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:27.457\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:27.457 --> 00:00:28.884\nReady to dive right back into Server Plus.\n\n13\n00:00:28.884 --> 00:00:32.464\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\ntalking about troubleshooting storage.\n\n14\n00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:34.793\nAnd it is an important process.\n\n15\n00:00:34.793 --> 00:00:38.251\nIt's actually one of the more important\nthings that we troubleshoot but\n\n16\n00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:39.961\nit's also one of the easiest ones.\n\n17\n00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:44.340\nBecause when storage fails,\nit's usually very, very obvious.\n\n18\n00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.479\nIt's not like memory errors where they\ncome and go and they're intermittent.\n\n19\n00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:52.517\nStorage errors are typically permanent and\nthey can be intermittent sometimes.\n\n20\n00:00:52.517 --> 00:00:55.630\nBut they're normally permanent,\nwhich makes them very, very easy to spot.\n\n21\n00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.210\nSo for example, if you maintain\na datacenter, one of your jobs, or\n\n22\n00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.160\nsomebody's job in the organization, should\nbe to go and visually inspect servers.\n\n23\n00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.740\nAnd you visually inspect the servers\nonce a day, once a week,\n\n24\n00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.870\nwhatever interval it is that\nyou're comfortable with.\n\n25\n00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.260\nBut when you visually inspect the servers,\nwhat you're doing is looking for\n\n26\n00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.570\nthings like dust buildup.\n\n27\n00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.990\nYou're looking to make sure racks\nare locked like they're supposed to.\n\n28\n00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.190\nThe servers are in place and\npowered on, those things.\n\n29\n00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.480\nBut you're also checking,\nbecause most servers have a little LCD\n\n30\n00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.730\nscreen on them that can\ngive you error messages.\n\n31\n00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.311\nThey have a blinking light that can\nlet you know if there's an error,\n\n32\n00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:30.618\nand all of the hard\ndrives will have lights.\n\n33\n00:01:30.618 --> 00:01:33.039\nAnd the hard drive lights\nare typically blinking green,\n\n34\n00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.810\nletting you know that the disk is active.\n\n35\n00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.386\nOr if the server's really super idle for\nsome reason, they might just be sitting\n\n36\n00:01:38.386 --> 00:01:41.630\nthere with a steady green light or\nno green light at all.\n\n37\n00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.640\nBut when something goes wrong,\nthat's when that red light lights up, or\n\n38\n00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.730\nan amber light.\n\n39\n00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.670\nAnd when that light is lit, that tells you\nthat something went wrong with the drive.\n\n40\n00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.720\nYou can visually and easily inspect and\nsee that and know that there's a problem.\n\n41\n00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.950\nBut you don't really\nknow what the problem is.\n\n42\n00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.130\nIs the drive not spinning anymore?\n\n43\n00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.990\nDid the drive get a recoverable error,\nlike one bad read on it and\n\n44\n00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.050\nit was able to salvage the data and\nyou're continuing to run fine?\n\n45\n00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.748\nIs the drive failed and a hot spare has\nalready jumped in and taken its place so\n\n46\n00:02:10.748 --> 00:02:12.220\nyou're safe?\n\n47\n00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.540\nYou don't know all that.\n\n48\n00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.400\nThe light doesn't tell\nyou all that information.\n\n49\n00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.940\nIt just lets you know there's a problem.\n\n50\n00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.710\nGives you a warning.\n\n51\n00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.260\nYour warning you need to go and\nfind what's going on.\n\n52\n00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.800\nNow you don't necessarily\nwanna rely on the lights.\n\n53\n00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.002\nBecause if you're like me, I don't go\nin that server room every day, and\n\n54\n00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:28.965\nif it weren't for\nthis glass wall behind me,\n\n55\n00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:31.511\nI probably wouldn't see those\nservers on any given week.\n\n56\n00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:35.997\nSo how do we know if we're not\nactually paying attention?\n\n57\n00:02:35.997 --> 00:02:38.067\nWell, that's when you set\nup an alerting system.\n\n58\n00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:42.048\nMost environments will use something\nlike the HP insight system,\n\n59\n00:02:42.048 --> 00:02:44.189\nwhere it will monitor the servers.\n\n60\n00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.491\nAnd if there's a drive failure,\nit'll shoot you an email or\n\n61\n00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:47.448\nsend you a text message.\n\n62\n00:02:47.448 --> 00:02:50.553\nThey can even, if they're smart enough,\nif the system's under warranty,\n\n63\n00:02:50.553 --> 00:02:52.660\ncan even call in the warranty ticket for\nyou.\n\n64\n00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.060\nAnd all of a sudden a hard drive shows up\nthe next day that you can go and swap out.\n\n65\n00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.093\nThat stuff is really, really nice.\n\n66\n00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:02.180\nSo as far as troubleshooting,\nit might already be taken care of for us.\n\n67\n00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.800\nBut there are some problems that\ncan creep in we might not notice.\n\n68\n00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.230\nAnd we might not even\ntrigger our monitoring alert.\n\n69\n00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.850\nAnd that's the spots where we need\nto be able to step in, and look, and\n\n70\n00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.050\nfind out what's going on.\n\n71\n00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.420\nAnd the number one instance that I wanna\nmention is when somebody calls in and\n\n72\n00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.780\ncomplains, and says, boy,\nthis server seems awfully slow today.\n\n73\n00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.450\nOr email is slow today.\n\n74\n00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.636\nOr, I'm trying to use our company website,\nand it's taking forever to load.\n\n75\n00:03:26.636 --> 00:03:31.151\nWell, when you have a performing\nissue like that, it could be CPU,\n\n76\n00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:32.269\nit could be RAM.\n\n77\n00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.578\nBut storage is the slowest\ncomponent in your computer.\n\n78\n00:03:36.578 --> 00:03:39.997\nIf you crack up your computer, you start\nripping out all the different pieces,\n\n79\n00:03:39.997 --> 00:03:41.333\nthe CPU is pretty darned fast.\n\n80\n00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:43.460\nYour RAM, pretty darned fast.\n\n81\n00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.820\nYour storage, not so much.\n\n82\n00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.950\nNow, if it's spinning disk,\nit's absolutely slow.\n\n83\n00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.420\nBut if it's an SSD, it's faster but\nit's still not as fast as your RAM.\n\n84\n00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.500\nAnd it's still not as fast as your CPU.\n\n85\n00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.660\nSo when people start\ncomplaining about performance,\n\n86\n00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.290\nstorage is often a big part of that.\n\n87\n00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.651\nIt's often the bottleneck.\n\n88\n00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:02.299\nNot a guarantee, but often.\n\n89\n00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.923\n&gt;&gt; You know Don, with something like the\nHP software that you're talking about and\n\n90\n00:04:06.923 --> 00:04:07.740\nmonitoring.\n\n91\n00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.030\nIt's not inside of our operating system.\n\n92\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.970\nBut it is monitoring the hardware.\n\n93\n00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.990\nHow are we gonna be able to detect\nsomething if the very software that we\n\n94\n00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.350\nhave to detect problems kinda turns\na blind eye or doesn't see it?\n\n95\n00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.860\nHow are we actually gonna\ndiagnose those errors?\n\n96\n00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that's where we go back\nto one of the things we mentioned way back\n\n97\n00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.470\nin the beginning of the series is\nthat when you install a new server,\n\n98\n00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.290\nyou should do a performance baseline.\n\n99\n00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:35.100\nAnd part of that baseline is tracking\nCPU and memory and network and disk I/O.\n\n100\n00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.390\nOn the disk I/O side, we need to know\nhow much time it takes to read and\n\n101\n00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.435\nwrite data to the disk.\n\n102\n00:04:39.435 --> 00:04:41.940\nWhat's the average disk queue\nlength over any given time?\n\n103\n00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.692\nThose little metrics that tell\nus how a drive is performing.\n\n104\n00:04:44.692 --> 00:04:48.220\nAnd then that way when somebody calls and\ncomplains that the drive is slow,\n\n105\n00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.074\nthe drive might show as being healthy.\n\n106\n00:04:50.074 --> 00:04:51.978\nBut then I go and pull up my metrics and\n\n107\n00:04:51.978 --> 00:04:56.030\nsure enough I see where the drive\nlatency is higher than it should be.\n\n108\n00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.460\nOr it's just taking longer to\nretrieve data from that disk,\n\n109\n00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.160\nsomething of that nature.\n\n110\n00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.040\nAnd I go and look and\nthe hardware is actually fine.\n\n111\n00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.870\nThe hardware might be perfectly fine, but\nthe load on the server has increased.\n\n112\n00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.566\nAnd monitoring software\nisn't gonna pick that up.\n\n113\n00:05:11.566 --> 00:05:15.090\nMonitoring software is watching for\nthe health of the hardware, right?\n\n114\n00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.600\nHP's Insight Manager is designed to\nwatch the health of the hardware.\n\n115\n00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.780\nAnd Dell's software,\nwhose name I can never remember,\n\n116\n00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.950\nif you're running things like\nCA Unicenter, or WhatsUp Gold,\n\n117\n00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.855\nor whatever, they're all designed to\nmonitor that health of the system.\n\n118\n00:05:31.855 --> 00:05:34.662\nAnd usually the health of the hardware and\nnot so much performance.\n\n119\n00:05:34.662 --> 00:05:35.370\nCuz they don't know.\n\n120\n00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.970\nThey don't know what's normal\nperformance for you and what's not.\n\n121\n00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.080\nNow obviously,\nif you're running at a 100% CPU,\n\n122\n00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.640\neverybody knows that's probably\nnot a good thing, right?\n\n123\n00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.260\nBut if you're running at 80% CPU,\nthat might be normal for you.\n\n124\n00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.750\nBut that might be high for me.\n\n125\n00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.760\nSo we've gotta make sure\nwe set those boundaries.\n\n126\n00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.510\nWe've gotta go in and\ncustomize that software to meet our needs.\n\n127\n00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.510\nThe other thing is there's\ndifferent types of storage.\n\n128\n00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.640\nAnd so you can have problems that\nare being affected by other components.\n\n129\n00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.440\nThat's the real challenge\nof troubleshooting storage.\n\n130\n00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.950\nIs it used to be we all had\ndirect attached storage, right?\n\n131\n00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.050\nSo like the diagram that\nI've got pulled up here.\n\n132\n00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.437\nI've got a bunch of servers.\n\n133\n00:06:05.437 --> 00:06:07.725\nAnd these are virtualization hosts, right?\n\n134\n00:06:07.725 --> 00:06:10.657\nSo VM Hosts one through four, and\nthey've all got direct attached storage.\n\n135\n00:06:10.657 --> 00:06:13.360\nStorage that's either right\ninside of the chassis or\n\n136\n00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.709\nin an external array\ndirectly attached to it.\n\n137\n00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.045\nAnd so if a server is performing poorly,\n\n138\n00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:21.700\nit might just be its own storage\nright there inside of that box.\n\n139\n00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.220\nIt's all self-contained,\nI can troubleshoot, and look at it.\n\n140\n00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.470\nBut what if I have a SAN\nwith a redundant fabric?\n\n141\n00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.580\nNow I've got a lot of\ncomponents in the mix.\n\n142\n00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.943\nFirst off,\nI might have my four VM hosts down here.\n\n143\n00:06:36.943 --> 00:06:38.833\nBut they've all got two HBAs and\n\n144\n00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:42.199\nthe HBAs run over fiber links\nto two different switches.\n\n145\n00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:45.008\nAnd the two different switches run\nover fiber links to two completely\n\n146\n00:06:45.008 --> 00:06:46.010\ndifferent SANS.\n\n147\n00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.748\nAnd the SANS are shared.\n\n148\n00:06:47.748 --> 00:06:54.310\nSo Node 3 might be just fine accessing\nSAN 1, but Node 1 can't access SAN 1.\n\n149\n00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.070\nOr Node 3 is generating more\nutilization than normal.\n\n150\n00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.370\nAnd Node 1 is running at\nits normal utilization, but\n\n151\n00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.220\nnow it's slow because Node 3 is\nconsuming more than it should.\n\n152\n00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.926\nSo I'm seeing symptoms on Node 1\nwhen nothing is wrong with Node 1.\n\n153\n00:07:08.926 --> 00:07:12.760\nI'm seeing symptoms on Node 1\nbecause Node 3 is going crazy and\n\n154\n00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.251\nconsuming all the bandwidth into SAN 1.\n\n155\n00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:19.747\nSee, I've got this one link in the SAN\n1 right here via that switch, and\n\n156\n00:07:19.747 --> 00:07:22.270\nthat can start to cause issues.\n\n157\n00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.918\nWhere it gets even more complex is\nif you're doing something like MPIO.\n\n158\n00:07:25.918 --> 00:07:28.810\nMPIO is multi-path input\noutput operations,\n\n159\n00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.810\nor multipath for\nmesh networks like this one.\n\n160\n00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.600\nWhere I might be load balancing\nacross these two connections.\n\n161\n00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.510\nSo that I can go through this switch to\nget to SAN 1 and I can follow this link\n\n162\n00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.690\nover to the other switch over to SAN 1,\nI can double my bandwidth.\n\n163\n00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.740\nWell, now I might see a performance hit,\nwhich link is it?\n\n164\n00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.739\nIt could be a problem with switch 1 or\na problem with switch 2.\n\n165\n00:07:51.739 --> 00:07:53.531\nNow things get really confusing.\n\n166\n00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:56.656\nSo when you look at storage issues,\nyou have to think about the path.\n\n167\n00:07:56.656 --> 00:07:59.504\nThe path that your server\nhas to take to get to it.\n\n168\n00:07:59.504 --> 00:08:01.790\nAnd I usually think of it in terms of CPU.\n\n169\n00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.210\nSo if I have a CPU on the motherboard,\n\n170\n00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:09.040\nwhat path does it have to follow to\nget to the storage that I'm accessing?\n\n171\n00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.140\nIt might have to cross\nthe PCI bus to an HBA.\n\n172\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:16.510\nAnd then cross the HBA over to the fiber\nmesh, go through a switch, over to a SAN,\n\n173\n00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.460\ndown to a particular LUN\nto access a virtual disk.\n\n174\n00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.030\nTry and see how many acronyms\nI can get in one sentence.\n\n175\n00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.658\nOr the CPU might go to the PCI bus,\n\n176\n00:08:25.658 --> 00:08:30.580\nhit a serial-attached SCSI controller,\nand jump right to a disk.\n\n177\n00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.900\nNow there's far less\ncomponents in that mix.\n\n178\n00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.440\nFar less things for me to troubleshoot and\nlook at for performance issues.\n\n179\n00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.060\nSo when it comes to slow file access,\nthink about that path.\n\n180\n00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.200\nThink about everything that's\ninvolved in the pathway.\n\n181\n00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.000\nAnd it may not be file access\nthat's the problem at all.\n\n182\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.130\nIt might turn out to be RAM or CPU.\n\n183\n00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.730\nBut look at the path that you follow\nto get your data and look for\n\n184\n00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:49.706\nperformance issues there.\n\n185\n00:08:49.706 --> 00:08:53.842\nAll right, other things,\nif you go to power on your system, and\n\n186\n00:08:53.842 --> 00:08:56.227\nyou get operating system not found.\n\n187\n00:08:56.227 --> 00:08:58.609\nWe talked about this in\nthe software episodes,\n\n188\n00:08:58.609 --> 00:09:01.390\nthat it could indicate a drive failure.\n\n189\n00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.090\nOften times it's not\nthe drive failure though.\n\n190\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.067\nWhen you get OS not found, often times\nthat's going to be something happened to\n\n191\n00:09:06.067 --> 00:09:08.252\nthe operating system where\nyou got some data corruption.\n\n192\n00:09:08.252 --> 00:09:13.923\nWhich might be caused by bad discs, or\nif the disks have gone completely online.\n\n193\n00:09:13.923 --> 00:09:14.841\nIn a data center,\n\n194\n00:09:14.841 --> 00:09:19.410\nthe number one time that I see OS not\nfound is when we're booting off of a SAN.\n\n195\n00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.420\nWhen your boot disks\nare actually on the SAN and\n\n196\n00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.500\nyour server has to use\nthe HBS to get there.\n\n197\n00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.670\nSomething could go wrong with the HBA,\nwith its fiber link,\n\n198\n00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.160\nwith the switch, with the switch's\nfiber link, and then with the SAN.\n\n199\n00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.340\nYou've got five different components right\nthere that are all in the mix that stop\n\n200\n00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.510\nme from getting to my operating system.\n\n201\n00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.930\nAny of those could be a problem.\n\n202\n00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.862\nWhen the operating system is on\ndrives inside of your server though,\n\n203\n00:09:39.862 --> 00:09:42.390\nit would usually have to be\na failed drive for that to happen.\n\n204\n00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.930\nIt could be a cable wiggled loose,\nthat does happen.\n\n205\n00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.810\nBut often times it's a failed drive.\n\n206\n00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.730\nYou probably have a RAID controller.\n\n207\n00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.545\nAnd so\na failed drive shouldn't down your system.\n\n208\n00:09:51.545 --> 00:09:53.585\nA failed drive shouldn't cause\noperating system not found.\n\n209\n00:09:53.585 --> 00:09:56.278\nIf you've got mirrored disks like RAID 1,\nor\n\n210\n00:09:56.278 --> 00:10:01.126\nyou've got RAID 5 or whatever, not RAID 0,\nright, that's just performance.\n\n211\n00:10:01.126 --> 00:10:03.797\nOne failed disk will lead to\nan operating system not found.\n\n212\n00:10:03.797 --> 00:10:05.317\nSo we do need to check the disk health,\nbut\n\n213\n00:10:05.317 --> 00:10:10.167\nit's not generally going to\ngenerate a OS not found issue.\n\n214\n00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:11.817\nData not available would\nbe the same thing.\n\n215\n00:10:11.817 --> 00:10:15.267\nData not available just\nmeans we can't access disks\n\n216\n00:10:15.267 --> 00:10:16.977\nthat aren't necessarily\nthe operating system, right.\n\n217\n00:10:16.977 --> 00:10:19.747\nYour operating system boots up fine and\nthen you can't get at your other data.\n\n218\n00:10:19.747 --> 00:10:22.067\nIt could mean that a particular\narray is down or, again,\n\n219\n00:10:22.067 --> 00:10:23.867\na LUN on a SAN is not accessible.\n\n220\n00:10:23.867 --> 00:10:26.076\nBut that's where you'll typically\nsee that one, all right?\n\n221\n00:10:26.076 --> 00:10:29.550\nNow I keep throwing up things like this,\nhow do we spot this stuff?\n\n222\n00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.194\nWell, if I walk into the server room,\nI can look for lights or\n\n223\n00:10:33.194 --> 00:10:35.280\nI can use third-party software.\n\n224\n00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.020\nAnd there's great third-party software for\nmanaging this.\n\n225\n00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:37.840\nAnd actually,\n\n226\n00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.220\nI shouldn't say third-party, there's\ngreat first party software for this.\n\n227\n00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:46.770\nIf I have a HP server, there is HP\nsoftware for me to diagnose that hardware.\n\n228\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.010\nIf there is a Dell server,\n\n229\n00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.910\nthere's Dell software that\nlet's me diagnose the software.\n\n230\n00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.340\nLenovo, same thing.\n\n231\n00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.040\nThere's Microsoft software, but\nwe have to be really careful with that and\n\n232\n00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.290\nlet me kind of just show you an example.\n\n233\n00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:01.340\nLet's see that's RedHat, this is Windows,\nhere we go, so I'm on a Windows server.\n\n234\n00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.260\nAnd on the Windows server,\nif I go into my computer management and\n\n235\n00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.400\ngo into disk management I'm gonna\nsee all the disks on the server.\n\n236\n00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.270\nWell what does it see,\nit sees that I have two disks.\n\n237\n00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.890\nOne's a CD rom drive,\nso that doesn't count.\n\n238\n00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.580\nAnd then I've got disk 0.\n\n239\n00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:20.447\nAnd disk 0 is 5.6 terabytes in size.\n\n240\n00:11:20.447 --> 00:11:25.247\nAnd on it, I've got a 350 megabyte\nNTFS partition for booting and\n\n241\n00:11:25.247 --> 00:11:28.850\nthen I've got a two terabytes C drive.\n\n242\n00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.560\nAnd then I've got about three and a half\nterabytes of empty space right here.\n\n243\n00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.180\nSo it just sees one disk.\n\n244\n00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.225\nWell if I have one disk and that one\ndisk fails, what happens to my system?\n\n245\n00:11:36.225 --> 00:11:37.820\nIt can't boot.\n\n246\n00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.480\nBut I don't have one disk,\nactually I have four disks.\n\n247\n00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.500\nBut Windows doesn't see that\nbecause I have a RAID controller.\n\n248\n00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.620\nThe RAID controller is\nbuilding a RAID 5 array,\n\n249\n00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.990\nor actually I don't know how this server's\nconfigured, I didn't look before the show.\n\n250\n00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.230\nBut it definitely has four drives,\n\n251\n00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.790\nit might be three drives in\narray-5 array with one spare.\n\n252\n00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.610\nIt might be four drives\nall in a RAID 5 array.\n\n253\n00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:03.480\nI don't know, so I don't know,\nand Windows doesn't know.\n\n254\n00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.920\nSo we can't trust our operating\nsystem to report back\n\n255\n00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.610\non the status of hardware drives.\n\n256\n00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.890\nThis is where the first\nparty software comes in.\n\n257\n00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.520\nThe party depends on whose\nperspective your looking at it from.\n\n258\n00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.320\nIf I'm looking at it from Microsoft's\nperspective, it's third party software.\n\n259\n00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.290\nBut I'm talking about the server,\nI'm talking about the hardware,\n\n260\n00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:21.780\nso it is first party software.\n\n261\n00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.650\nThis is software written by the vendor.\n\n262\n00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:29.270\nSo HP has this pretty sweet utility which\nis called the Array Configuration Utility.\n\n263\n00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.960\nThey actually have a few\ndifferent utilities.\n\n264\n00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.030\nThere's an Array Configuration Utility and\na diskware utility and a few other things.\n\n265\n00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.010\nBut the Array Configuration Utility\nactually has all the other utilities built\n\n266\n00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.520\ninto it so\nthis is the one that I usually use.\n\n267\n00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.250\nThis is software that you can\nrun right on the server and\n\n268\n00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.590\nit talks to the RAID controller.\n\n269\n00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:51.410\nAnd it understands the underlying\ndisks that are sitting beneath it that\n\n270\n00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:52.810\nWindows doesn't even see.\n\n271\n00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.197\nI was in the disk manager,\nyou'd think the stuff would show up there.\n\n272\n00:12:56.197 --> 00:12:59.963\nI could go into my Device Manager and\neven in the Device Manager,\n\n273\n00:12:59.963 --> 00:13:05.130\nif I go under disk drives, it just shows\nHP Logical Volume SCSI disk device, right.\n\n274\n00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.470\nSo even here,\nit doesn't see the four physical disks.\n\n275\n00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.930\nIt doesn't know they exist.\n\n276\n00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.220\nSo one of those physical disks\ncould be failing right now.\n\n277\n00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.600\nIt could be completely offline.\n\n278\n00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.210\nI could have ripped one of\nthose disks out of the rack.\n\n279\n00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.360\nAnd it wouldn't even know it,\nWindows wouldn't know it.\n\n280\n00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.790\nBut the third, first, whatever party\nsoftware, the HP software will know it.\n\n281\n00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:30.600\nAnd so when I come in here, it sees\nnot disks, but the Array Controller.\n\n282\n00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.810\nSo here it shows us Smart Array P410, and\n\n283\n00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:37.660\nI can pull up that Array Controller and\nI can see its status, all right?\n\n284\n00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:42.270\nIf it's got an error, warnings, or just\ninformational notes, I'll see that here.\n\n285\n00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:46.770\nAnd right now, mine's healthy, so I'm\nnot really seeing a whole heck of a lot.\n\n286\n00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:51.200\nI can go into my Array Controller, here's\nmy SATA Array Controller, 1 Logical Drive,\n\n287\n00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.860\nand it's not really telling much\nhere until I hit More Information.\n\n288\n00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.735\nBut when I hit More Information,\nnow it's gonna tell me about it.\n\n289\n00:13:57.735 --> 00:14:01.360\nAnd it's gonna tell me that there's\nactually four physical drives,\n\n290\n00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.750\nI see all for of them.\n\n291\n00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.720\nAnd I have 1 logical drive\nwhich is set up as RAID 5.\n\n292\n00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.310\nSo I know it's not RAID 10 or RAID 0,\n\n293\n00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:12.710\nWindows couldn't tell me that because\nWindows didn't even know this existed.\n\n294\n00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:16.290\nRight, but in this utility I\ncan see it and I can tell.\n\n295\n00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:20.880\nAnd if I had a failed drive,\nI would see it right here.\n\n296\n00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.740\nI would know that I have\na drive that's in failure.\n\n297\n00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:28.420\nAnd if I had a spare drive,\nI would see it right here, and I don't.\n\n298\n00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:33.140\nSo if I came in here and\nthree drives showed up here and\n\n299\n00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.140\none showed up under spare, that's normal.\n\n300\n00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.300\nI've got my standard operation and\nnow I could support a failure and\n\n301\n00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.080\nthe spare is ready to jump in.\n\n302\n00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.630\n&gt;&gt; Don, with something like\nthis being given to us,\n\n303\n00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.920\nthe ability to monitor direct\naccess storage, that's great.\n\n304\n00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.500\nIs there a way that if we do have switch\nfabric, we've got all the components that\n\n305\n00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.939\nare in the moving components\nin a fiber channel set up.\n\n306\n00:14:50.939 --> 00:14:56.500\nThat we can actually monitor the health\nof the fiber channel infrastructure?\n\n307\n00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.960\n&gt;&gt; It's harder, but you can.\n\n308\n00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.760\nYou have a couple of different components,\nright?\n\n309\n00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:05.410\nSo if I were to launch this software\non an HP server that had an HPA in it,\n\n310\n00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.970\nI would see the HPA, right?\n\n311\n00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:12.630\nAnd I would see the SAN, but I wouldn't\nreally be able to manipulate the SAN\n\n312\n00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.000\nunless it was an HP SAN also, right?\n\n313\n00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.130\nAnd HP makes some great SANs so\nmaybe that's what I've got.\n\n314\n00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.560\nIf I've got HP servers and\nHP SANs then wonderful, right?\n\n315\n00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:27.512\nBut if I've got HP server and EMC SANs,\nthey don't play nice together.\n\n316\n00:15:27.512 --> 00:15:28.810\nSo now I need separate software for that.\n\n317\n00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:32.270\nI need software for monitoring the SAN and\nI need software for\n\n318\n00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.990\nmonitoring the servers.\n\n319\n00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:36.870\nAnd I probably need software for\nmonitoring the switches too,\n\n320\n00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.110\nif I've got Cisco SAN switches or\nsomething.\n\n321\n00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.380\nEach of them are monitored\na little bit differently.\n\n322\n00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.150\nAnd they report their health differently.\n\n323\n00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.774\nAnd that's where you might choose\nto set up software like this, but\n\n324\n00:15:46.774 --> 00:15:48.949\nyou start ending up with all\nthese different packages.\n\n325\n00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:51.549\nSo it becomes easier to have\nthe systems monitor themselves,\n\n326\n00:15:51.549 --> 00:15:53.205\nwhere they can just shoot you an email.\n\n327\n00:15:53.205 --> 00:15:54.955\nAnd right now,\nI just have one email system.\n\n328\n00:15:54.955 --> 00:15:57.493\nBut the negative there is,\nwhat if they lose power?\n\n329\n00:15:57.493 --> 00:15:59.470\nAre they gonna tell you,\nhey I just lost power.\n\n330\n00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.529\nI'm actually turned off right now.\n\n331\n00:16:01.529 --> 00:16:03.550\nWell they usually can't.\n\n332\n00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:07.780\nOn a server maybe you have a inside or\nsomething like that that might work.\n\n333\n00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.132\nBut if you have an actual power outage or\nthe server is powered down,\n\n334\n00:16:11.132 --> 00:16:12.730\nit's not gonna be able to report to you.\n\n335\n00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:17.110\nSo it's better to have a separate system\ndoing the monitoring, so it can look and\n\n336\n00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.890\nsay, that system's offline.\n\n337\n00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.030\nIt shouldn't be offline but it is.\n\n338\n00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:23.070\nI don't know why it's offline,\nbut I can at least tell you, and\n\n339\n00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:26.072\nsend you a text message or\nwhatever it is that it notifies with.\n\n340\n00:16:26.072 --> 00:16:28.360\nSo this software is really valuable,\n\n341\n00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.385\nbecause it lets you see into that\nhardware while the server's on.\n\n342\n00:16:32.385 --> 00:16:35.285\nI could always reboot it and go into the\narray configuration and see it there, too,\n\n343\n00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:36.475\nbut now I've got to take\nthe server offline.\n\n344\n00:16:36.475 --> 00:16:37.695\nI'm looking at it while it's online.\n\n345\n00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:41.695\nAnd going even further than that,\n\n346\n00:16:41.695 --> 00:16:47.330\nnot only can I see the current disks\nas they are, I can do diagnostics.\n\n347\n00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.900\nThe diagnostics are important.\n\n348\n00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.600\nIf I have a true failure, then the disks,\nthey're gonna be offline,\n\n349\n00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.240\nI'll see it's really easy\nto open up a warranty call.\n\n350\n00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:00.020\nBut, what if I know those\ndisks are failing, but\n\n351\n00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.530\nthey're just not failing right now.\n\n352\n00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.970\nAnd so I call tech support and they say\nwe don't see the problem, what can we do?\n\n353\n00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.140\nI might wanna go in and\nrun Array Diagnostics while it's failing,\n\n354\n00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.350\nor even while it's normal, just to\ntest it out and see where it's going.\n\n355\n00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:14.170\nAnd so\nwe can launch those Array Diagnostics and\n\n356\n00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.810\nit'll run through and they check.\n\n357\n00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:20.520\nNow one of the cool parts is,\nthat it has these SmartSSD Wear Gauge.\n\n358\n00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.590\nIf you're using SSD, they wear out, right?\n\n359\n00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:28.140\nMost SSDs only rate at, they'll tell\nyou about a hundred thousand writes.\n\n360\n00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.490\nSo when you do a hundred thousand writes,\nthat's the lifetime of that disk, and\n\n361\n00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:32.720\nnow you should replace it.\n\n362\n00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.260\nIn reality,\n\n363\n00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.330\nyou can usually get about three hundred\nthousand writes before they fail.\n\n364\n00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.750\nBut they always under-state,\nbecause they put the stuff under warranty.\n\n365\n00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.470\nThey don't wanna pay if they\nguarantee a higher number, and\n\n366\n00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:43.750\nyou don't get that higher number.\n\n367\n00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.250\nBut if you're running\na mission critical server,\n\n368\n00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:51.420\nhow do you track that, how do you know,\nI wonder how many writes that SSD had.\n\n369\n00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.130\nIt's hard to tell.\n\n370\n00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:55.110\nWell utilities like the SmartSSD\nwear gauge they'll tell you.\n\n371\n00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:58.850\nIt'll look at the disk and\nevaluate and generate a wear report\n\n372\n00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.190\nto let you know how far along you\nare in the lifetime of that disk.\n\n373\n00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:07.030\nThis is the way that we can stop\na failure before it occurs.\n\n374\n00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:10.120\nAll right, some of the other things\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n375\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.670\nIf you have an unsuccessful backup.\n\n376\n00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:17.070\nWhen storage fails, storage failing is\none of the worst things that can happen.\n\n377\n00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.630\nThink about, let's put servers\nout of our mind for a moment.\n\n378\n00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.850\nYou are a college student.\n\n379\n00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.130\nAnd you've got a laptop, and\nyou just wrote this giant paper,\n\n380\n00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.880\nyour thesis,\nyour master thesis or whatever.\n\n381\n00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.790\nAnd it's on your hard drive on your\ncomputer and the hard drive fails.\n\n382\n00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.070\nWell what happened to your data?\n\n383\n00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.890\nHopefully, you have a backup.\n\n384\n00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:38.020\nCuz otherwise, you're out of luck.\n\n385\n00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.010\nThe drive is dead.\n\n386\n00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.503\nMaybe you can send that drive off\nto a drive reclamation facility and\n\n387\n00:18:42.503 --> 00:18:44.720\nthey can crack it open and\nget the data out.\n\n388\n00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.775\nBut they usually charge between 2 and\n$6,000.\n\n389\n00:18:46.775 --> 00:18:47.936\nThat's a lot of money.\n\n390\n00:18:47.936 --> 00:18:50.490\nWell, let's get back into server world for\na minute.\n\n391\n00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:53.000\nLet's say the same thing happens and\nI have an array fail.\n\n392\n00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.140\nAnd the array's 15 drives.\n\n393\n00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.970\nCan I just send in One Drive for recovery?\n\n394\n00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.040\nI gotta send all 15, the whole thing.\n\n395\n00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.050\nThe server's offline,\nalready, that's bad enough.\n\n396\n00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.190\nNow I gotta send the whole thing in for\nreclamation.\n\n397\n00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:09.350\nThat is not a economical process, and\nit's definitely not a timely process.\n\n398\n00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:10.880\nSo we need to have back ups.\n\n399\n00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.070\nIf we have back ups,\nI don't care if the hardware fails.\n\n400\n00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.680\nI care if I have a little down time,\nbut I know I can recover my data and\n\n401\n00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.760\nI'll be safe, right?\n\n402\n00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.220\nUnless my backups failed.\n\n403\n00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.840\nSo as part of monitoring storage,\nyou also need to be monitoring backups.\n\n404\n00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.281\nThat should be part of your\ndisaster recovery process anyway.\n\n405\n00:19:26.281 --> 00:19:29.250\nYou need to make sure that your\nbackups are successful and stable,\n\n406\n00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.532\nthat is an important thing.\n\n407\n00:19:32.412 --> 00:19:35.332\nMost of the other errors that CompTIA\ncalls out are all kinda tied to\n\n408\n00:19:35.332 --> 00:19:36.280\nthe same thing.\n\n409\n00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.120\nWe've got unable to mount the device.\n\n410\n00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.230\nIf the disk won't mount,\nit can be a hardware error,\n\n411\n00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:43.170\nif it's a hardware error\nthe disk typically won't show up.\n\n412\n00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.675\nIf you have a disk that won't mount,\n\n413\n00:19:44.675 --> 00:19:47.560\na lot of times it's more like\na partition table type problem.\n\n414\n00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.840\nYou might need to fix or\nrepair your partition table.\n\n415\n00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.450\nIn the Unix world you can\nuse fdisk to do that.\n\n416\n00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.800\nIn the Windows world you have Fix NBR,\n\n417\n00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.640\na number of other command\nline utilities you can use.\n\n418\n00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.220\nIn Windows you have Boot CFG and\nstuff that'll go through and\n\n419\n00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.300\nfix some of these boot files that\nyou can use then to repair that.\n\n420\n00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.230\nBut that's more on the software\nside than the storage side.\n\n421\n00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.040\nThe bigger question though\nis why did that happen?\n\n422\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.470\nWhy did we get that?\n\n423\n00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:12.670\nAnd it could be that I'm getting\ndata corruption on the disc.\n\n424\n00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.220\nWhich is caused by bad sectors.\n\n425\n00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:20.250\nOr the heads on the disc going bad, or an\nSSD that's been written to too many times.\n\n426\n00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.550\nAnd there's no way to\nreverse that process.\n\n427\n00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.820\nSo as soon as we see that happening, we\nneed to replace that storage, otherwise,\n\n428\n00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.600\nit's just gonna be an outage eventually.\n\n429\n00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.690\nWhether or not we want it to be or not.\n\n430\n00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:34.260\nAll right I already talked a little\nbit about slow IO performance, but\n\n431\n00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.050\nlet me double back on that real quick.\n\n432\n00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:40.490\nIf your disks are appearing to be slow,\noftentimes they're just slow,\n\n433\n00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.360\nthat's how disks are, right?\n\n434\n00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.390\nBut they might be slower than normal.\n\n435\n00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.900\nAnd that's where we need to have that\nbaseline, and you can use any performance\n\n436\n00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.496\nmonitor type utility to go in there and\nmonitor how that disk performance is.\n\n437\n00:20:51.496 --> 00:20:53.412\nWhat is your seek time, and so on?\n\n438\n00:20:53.412 --> 00:20:56.410\nThere's third-party utilities out\nthere you can use to test it,\n\n439\n00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:58.280\nif you wanna try to get\nan independent view.\n\n440\n00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.810\nBut in Windows, I just usually\nuse the performance monitor.\n\n441\n00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:02.170\nIt can run through and do that.\n\n442\n00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.200\nIn the Unix world, there's actually\na number of different utilities\n\n443\n00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.910\nyou can use to gauge it, and\nmeasure that performance.\n\n444\n00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:11.570\nSo it depends on which you're running.\n\n445\n00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.420\nWhat else do we have on this one?\n\n446\n00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.220\nI talk about backup failure.\n\n447\n00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.710\nCompTIA specifically calls\nout restore failure also.\n\n448\n00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:24.450\nWhen we do a backup, a lot of times the\nbackup job can say that it was successful.\n\n449\n00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.830\nBut there was a problem with the data.\n\n450\n00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.950\nIf you're backing up bad data,\nwhat are you gonna restore?\n\n451\n00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:30.960\nYou're gonna restore bad data.\n\n452\n00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.980\nSo if there's an unreadable\nsector on a drive and\n\n453\n00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.330\nyou go to back it up,\nthat sector is unreadable.\n\n454\n00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.101\nWhatever was there isn't gonna be\nretrieved and now we can't restore it.\n\n455\n00:21:38.101 --> 00:21:41.083\nSo dont just assume that you're\nbackup will save the day.\n\n456\n00:21:41.083 --> 00:21:42.620\nYou're supposed to test backups.\n\n457\n00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:43.440\nTry them out.\n\n458\n00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.200\nWhen you run a backup, most backup\nsoftware has the option to do a verify\n\n459\n00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.430\nthat makes the backup take\na heck of a lot longer.\n\n460\n00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:51.610\nBut it's testing to make sure that it\ncan reread everything off of the backup\n\n461\n00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:52.700\nin order to do the restore.\n\n462\n00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.240\nAnd that kind of stuff is handy.\n\n463\n00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.740\nCause it's gonna help you with\nrecovering that system, it is important.\n\n464\n00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:05.060\nIf you see multiple drive failure,\nmultiple drive failure is typically\n\n465\n00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.370\nan indicator that you have\na bigger problem than just drives.\n\n466\n00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:12.390\nYour problem is more than\nlikely backplane or power.\n\n467\n00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:14.550\nIf the drives aren't getting enough\npower they can't spin up right,\n\n468\n00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:18.040\nand if they can't spin up right\nthen you're gonna get errors.\n\n469\n00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.120\nIf they're SSDs they draw power too,\nnot as much, right.\n\n470\n00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.460\nSo it's not,\nit's a lot less likely to need power.\n\n471\n00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:28.190\nBut both SSD and spinning disk, plug into\na backplane, and the backplanes do fail.\n\n472\n00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.870\nEspecially on a hot swaps system.\n\n473\n00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.330\nMost system have hot plug hard drives.\n\n474\n00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:36.100\nAs you push them in and pull them back out\nover time, it will wear out that port.\n\n475\n00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.110\nI talk about that in\nthe troubleshooting hardware episode,\n\n476\n00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.780\nthat the backplane can fail.\n\n477\n00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.340\nAnd it might look like\nmultiple drive failures\n\n478\n00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.830\nwhen in actuality the drives are fine.\n\n479\n00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:50.440\nBut it's not unheard of to\nget a bad batch of drives.\n\n480\n00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.530\nWhen you buy a server with 15 drives and\nyou get them all at the same time,\n\n481\n00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.380\nthose drives are all\nmanufactured at the same time.\n\n482\n00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.990\nAnd so if there was a bad batch\nmanufactured at the factory,\n\n483\n00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:01.820\nyou could see multiple\ndrives fail all at once.\n\n484\n00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.570\nUsually a quick call to the vendor\nis all it takes to figure that out,\n\n485\n00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:05.430\ncuz they'll know.\n\n486\n00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:06.390\nWe've seen it here.\n\n487\n00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:10.710\nWes, do you remember the drives that we\nhad, they were like raptors or something?\n\n488\n00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:12.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nthey were 10,000 RPM velociraptors and\n\n489\n00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.520\nabout 50% of them had\na failure in the first year.\n\n490\n00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and those were all\npurchased at the same time, and so\n\n491\n00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.220\nthat kinda stuff does happen,\nright, we've seen it.\n\n492\n00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.740\nBut it's more of an outlier,\nit's not something that happens often.\n\n493\n00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.739\nSo just be aware that when you see\nmultiple drive failures normally\n\n494\n00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:30.160\nindicating a backplane\nfailure are possibly power.\n\n495\n00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:35.440\nAll right last thing I have to mention\non common problems is cache failure.\n\n496\n00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:41.230\nThat if you have a raid controller with\na battery backed write cache controller,\n\n497\n00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:44.160\nthen usually the cache\nis an add in module.\n\n498\n00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.139\nIf you go back to the server\ncomponents episode,\n\n499\n00:23:46.139 --> 00:23:49.242\nthe raid controller that I showed in\nthere had that, had that add in module.\n\n500\n00:23:49.242 --> 00:23:51.535\nBecause it's an addin\nmodule it can wiggle loose.\n\n501\n00:23:51.535 --> 00:23:53.370\nIt can come loose and it can go bad.\n\n502\n00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:54.991\nAny component can go bad.\n\n503\n00:23:54.991 --> 00:23:57.551\nAnd if that happens,\nit's easy enough to swap it out.\n\n504\n00:23:57.551 --> 00:23:58.917\nIf you have an extra one laying around.\n\n505\n00:23:58.917 --> 00:23:59.898\nBut who does?\n\n506\n00:23:59.898 --> 00:24:02.160\nWho has extra cache memory\njust laying on a table?\n\n507\n00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:02.750\nMost of us don't.\n\n508\n00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.920\nSo that one gets to be challenging.\n\n509\n00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.750\nFortunately, most RAID controllers,\nwhen that cache controller starts to\n\n510\n00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:11.100\ncome loose, they just disable the cache\nand they start writing to the disk.\n\n511\n00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.430\nWe see that as a performance decrease.\n\n512\n00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:14.110\nBut you might not notice.\n\n513\n00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.700\nIf it's something you're\nnot paying attention to.\n\n514\n00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.340\nSo that's where you need\nyour monitoring software.\n\n515\n00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.080\nIf I had a right cache controller fail,\n\n516\n00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.580\nI would see it in my HP\narray configuration utility.\n\n517\n00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.650\nIt would show me that cache\nwasn't working right.\n\n518\n00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.020\nI would get a warning and\nbe able to act on that.\n\n519\n00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.980\nSame thing with Dell power and\nRAID controllers, they do the same thing.\n\n520\n00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.780\nThey can alert you if that cache has\na failing battery or something else.\n\n521\n00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.110\nYou'll actually see it on the little\nLCD screen on the front of the server.\n\n522\n00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:41.110\nOkay, I've talked about\na lot of different things.\n\n523\n00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.490\nAnd a lot of the common problems.\n\n524\n00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.690\nWe're kind of running down the list\nhere to see if I missed any of them.\n\n525\n00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:48.055\nWes is telling me I missed a couple.\n\n526\n00:24:48.055 --> 00:24:50.500\n[LAUGH] The human stuff, right?\n\n527\n00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:55.050\nMisconfiguration and, when I come\nto you it gets funny sometimes.\n\n528\n00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:56.580\nSo misconfiguration.\n\n529\n00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.010\nAs a human being,\nwe can set up things wrong.\n\n530\n00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.470\nIt certainly happens.\n\n531\n00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:04.700\nI can configure an array incorrectly,\nand my performance takes a hit on that.\n\n532\n00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.740\nSo never underestimate the human\nability to mess things up.\n\n533\n00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.460\nI could have a stand\nwhere I've accidentally\n\n534\n00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.640\nassigned the same LUM number\nto two different servers.\n\n535\n00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.670\nAnd I've got two different servers\ntrying to access the same storage\n\n536\n00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:17.190\nat the same time.\n\n537\n00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:18.620\nWhat's that gonna result in?\n\n538\n00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.840\nData corruption.\n\n539\n00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.820\nAnd I might think,\nI keep getting data corruption.\n\n540\n00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.520\nThis drive must be bad.\n\n541\n00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.620\nIt's not the drive.\n\n542\n00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:28.160\nYou connected two servers to the same\nstorage, that's gonna cause problems.\n\n543\n00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:33.880\nSo misconfiguration on our part can\ncertainly lead to challenges like that.\n\n544\n00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.450\nAnd then the other thing CompTIA\ncalls out is improper termination.\n\n545\n00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:40.290\nNow I laughed when I saw this\nobjective because termination is not\n\n546\n00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.270\nsomething I've had to deal with in\nstorage in well over ten years.\n\n547\n00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:46.545\nSo it's not something most of\nus ever have to mess with.\n\n548\n00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:50.390\nBut just for completeness,\nin the olden days when you had a SCSI bus,\n\n549\n00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:53.250\nthe end of the SCSI bus\nhad to be terminated.\n\n550\n00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:57.200\nWell, all the newer standards\nof SCSI auto terminate.\n\n551\n00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.980\nSo, what will happen is you\ndaisy chain the drives.\n\n552\n00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:03.555\nYou have a big ribbon cable and\n\n553\n00:26:03.555 --> 00:26:04.732\nyou can have up to 14 drives\nattached to this ribbon cable.\n\n554\n00:26:04.732 --> 00:26:07.727\nAnd each one had a SCSI ID number on it,\nand\n\n555\n00:26:07.727 --> 00:26:11.763\nwhoever was the last one on\nthat chain had to terminate.\n\n556\n00:26:11.763 --> 00:26:15.940\nThe electrical signal that would cross\nthe line had to stop and reflect back.\n\n557\n00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.990\nAnd so the terminator did that job.\n\n558\n00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:21.880\nYour signal would go all the way to the\nend, hit that terminator and bounce back.\n\n559\n00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.490\nNow if the terminator wasn't there,\n\n560\n00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:27.080\nthe signal would just go on and\nthen disappear and never come back.\n\n561\n00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:31.260\nAnd so we wouldn't have a way to know did\nall the drives receive the signal or not.\n\n562\n00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.290\nBy that signal bouncing back to us,\n\n563\n00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.560\nthat's how we would know that it made\nit all the way to the end of the line.\n\n564\n00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.030\nIf the terminator wasn't there,\nwouldn't happen.\n\n565\n00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:42.930\nWell, modern drives all sense whether\nthey're the last one on the bus.\n\n566\n00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:45.320\nIf they don't see any other\ndrives talking beyond them,\n\n567\n00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.150\nthey assume they're the last ones,\nand they auto terminate.\n\n568\n00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:50.830\nSo we don't have to worry about it, right?\n\n569\n00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:55.120\nIf a drive fails though, maybe it's not\nauto terminating like it's supposed to.\n\n570\n00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.520\nAnd so now it malfunctions,\nwe might have a problem there.\n\n571\n00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.890\nBut in the olden days we used to\nactually take these little blocks,\n\n572\n00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.590\nthese little SCSI terminators,\njust stick them on the end of that cable.\n\n573\n00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:05.860\nAnd if you didn't have it there,\nit didn't work.\n\n574\n00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.400\nAt least it didn't work right,\nso you'd have problems.\n\n575\n00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.800\nBut we're talking about\nancient technology.\n\n576\n00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.770\nThose drives,\nwe are well beyond their lifetime.\n\n577\n00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:16.312\nSo if you're dealing with termination or\nany termination issues,\n\n578\n00:27:16.312 --> 00:27:20.414\nthe real issue is probably accounting,\nright, that you need to get a budget to\n\n579\n00:27:20.414 --> 00:27:23.789\nreplace those servers cuz you're\nwell beyond their lifetime.\n\n580\n00:27:23.789 --> 00:27:29.785\nOkay, after that, one of the tricky\nparts with storage is that we spend so\n\n581\n00:27:29.785 --> 00:27:34.830\nmuch time trying to make sure\nthat it is stable and redundant.\n\n582\n00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.660\nWe put things like RAID\ncontrollers in there.\n\n583\n00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.630\nAnd you can have failures and\nnot even know it.\n\n584\n00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.400\nBecause they recover themselves, right.\n\n585\n00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.170\nIf you have a RAID array and a drive\nfails, it starts running on parity and\n\n586\n00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:46.300\nyou don't even know it.\n\n587\n00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.890\nIf you have a RAID 10 array and\none fails, or a mirror.\n\n588\n00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:50.610\nA mirror, one fails and\nyou just flip over to the other drive.\n\n589\n00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.180\nYou don't even see a performance hit.\n\n590\n00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.620\nSo unless you're monitoring them for\n\n591\n00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.700\nthese failures, you're never\ngoing to see that they happened.\n\n592\n00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.683\nAnd so you're gonna end up in a situation\nwhere everything just seems to be right,\n\n593\n00:28:00.683 --> 00:28:03.181\nbut there is actually\na failure in the background.\n\n594\n00:28:05.368 --> 00:28:08.750\nOther things that you might see, for\nexample, that I mentioned cache failure.\n\n595\n00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:10.980\nIf a cache fails,\nthe cache gets turned off.\n\n596\n00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.730\nWell, if it gets turned off,\nyou might not notice that.\n\n597\n00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:16.060\nIt's a performance decrease.\n\n598\n00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.040\nThat's what you see.\n\n599\n00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.110\nAnd again, unless you have a reporting\nsoftware, you're not gonna see.\n\n600\n00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:20.480\nSo always be aware of that,\n\n601\n00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.300\nif you lose your storage,\nyou've effectively lost your server.\n\n602\n00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.180\nSo that's why we built so\nmuch redundancy into it.\n\n603\n00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.670\nThat's why we have these\ncomponents that are designed to\n\n604\n00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:29.710\nhandle failure a little more resiliently.\n\n605\n00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.930\nWhich makes it harder for\nus to spot that failure.\n\n606\n00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:33.750\nIt's a double-edge sword, right?\n\n607\n00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.130\nThe high N redundancy.\n\n608\n00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:42.480\nOkay, another problem that we\nmight have is mismatched drives.\n\n609\n00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.970\nWhen you start throwing drives into a\nserver, if I've got all 10,000 RPM drives\n\n610\n00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:52.520\nand one drive fails, and I go to my\ncloset and I pull out a spare drive and\n\n611\n00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.970\nit's a 7,200 RPM and I chuck it in there,\nwhat's gonna happen?\n\n612\n00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:59.210\nI've got one drive reading\nslower than the others, and\n\n613\n00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.930\nthat's going to affect\nperformance on the array.\n\n614\n00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:03.920\nIf I go and get a 15K RPM Drive and\n\n615\n00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.899\nchuck it in there,\nit's gonna go faster than the others, and\n\n616\n00:29:06.899 --> 00:29:10.580\nso I'm gonna get weird numbers when\nI try monitor performance on that.\n\n617\n00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.130\nIt can cause an issue.\n\n618\n00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.780\nAlso it doesn't help that\nserial attached SCSI and\n\n619\n00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.470\nSATA drives these days\npretty much look the same.\n\n620\n00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:20.130\nThe connector under that's\na little bit different.\n\n621\n00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:24.300\nBut from the front, top, bottom,\nside, they look the same.\n\n622\n00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:28.560\nSo you might be trying to stick\na SATA drive into a SAS slot and\n\n623\n00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.420\nit's not working.\n\n624\n00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.180\nIt's not going in right,\nso that can be a problem.\n\n625\n00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:37.550\nBut even when they're two SATA drives,\nI might have one that is SATA 2 and\n\n626\n00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:40.430\none that is SATA 3, or\na SAS 2 and a SAS 3 drive,\n\n627\n00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:43.850\nthe different standards within\nthat individual connector.\n\n628\n00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:44.790\nSo we need to try and\n\n629\n00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:47.570\nkeep our drives as similarly configured\nas possible when they're in an array.\n\n630\n00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:49.770\nIf it's not in an array then\nwe don't care about it, right?\n\n631\n00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:53.670\nIf I have two drives mirrored for the\noperating system, those might be 10k RPM.\n\n632\n00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:55.787\nBut then I might have five drives or\n\n633\n00:29:55.787 --> 00:30:00.679\nsix drives in a RAID 10 array that's\ngotta all 15,000 RPM SAS drives and\n\n634\n00:30:00.679 --> 00:30:04.990\nthey might be SAS3 whereas\nthe operating systems were SATA 2.\n\n635\n00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:07.020\nThat's okay,\nbecause they're separate arrays.\n\n636\n00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:11.490\nBut within an array you wanna try to keep\nthem the same and with your spare discs.\n\n637\n00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:14.910\nBecause the spare during a failure\nis gonna become a real disc.\n\n638\n00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:18.835\nAnd when you replace the failed disc,\nit becomes the spare.\n\n639\n00:30:18.835 --> 00:30:21.825\nAnd you're not normally gonna fail\nthem back over cuz it takes too long.\n\n640\n00:30:21.825 --> 00:30:25.885\nSo your spare disk should be\nthe same as your main disks.\n\n641\n00:30:25.885 --> 00:30:28.845\nIt's not like in a car where your\nspare tire might be that cheesy\n\n642\n00:30:28.845 --> 00:30:29.895\nlittle donut thing.\n\n643\n00:30:29.895 --> 00:30:33.235\nBecause you know you're just gonna swap\nit back to a regular tire later on.\n\n644\n00:30:33.235 --> 00:30:37.865\nHere, it takes so long to swap back to\na disk that you don't typically do it.\n\n645\n00:30:37.865 --> 00:30:43.650\nYou just have the spare be the same and\nthen you run from that.\n\n646\n00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:45.690\nOkay, now I did show some\ntroubleshooting tools.\n\n647\n00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:50.640\nI showed the computer management\ntool in Windows which lets me see\n\n648\n00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:54.410\nthe discs that are in my system and\nkind of customize those.\n\n649\n00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.260\nI showed the limitation there and\nhow we usually want to use\n\n650\n00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:00.420\nour hardware utilities for\nmanaging those array controllers.\n\n651\n00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.140\nI used Windows as an example.\n\n652\n00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.210\nIt's the same in Linux.\n\n653\n00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:07.000\nHP has the same exact utility\nthat runs under Linux.\n\n654\n00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.500\nAnd depending on your Linux distro,\n\n655\n00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:13.740\nlike I've got a Red Hat system here, it'll\nhave an equivalent of the disk manager.\n\n656\n00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:17.520\nIt might be, you go to the command\nprompt and run DiskPart ED.\n\n657\n00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.160\nThat might be it.\n\n658\n00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.610\nYou might just use fdisk.\n\n659\n00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:22.710\nOr in Red Hat there's actually\na little disks utility.\n\n660\n00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:24.690\nIt is buried in here somewhere.\n\n661\n00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:25.470\nWhere's that, Sundry?\n\n662\n00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:27.200\nNow I just have to find it.\n\n663\n00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.680\nThere it is, under utilities.\n\n664\n00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.060\nSo I've got a disks utility, and I can\nsee all the disks in this server, and\n\n665\n00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.500\nstart to work with it.\n\n666\n00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.670\nSame limitations as Windows, though.\n\n667\n00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:38.080\nIt's not gonna see a hardware RAID array.\n\n668\n00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.840\nIt's gonna see it as a single disk, so it\ndoesn't really know what these disks are.\n\n669\n00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.369\nSo these utilities are really designed for\npartition management.\n\n670\n00:31:44.369 --> 00:31:46.908\nFor configuring our partitions and\nadjusting them.\n\n671\n00:31:46.908 --> 00:31:49.777\nSo if I have a partition issue,\nyes these tools are great.\n\n672\n00:31:49.777 --> 00:31:53.532\nIf I've got a hardware issue, not so much.\n\n673\n00:31:53.532 --> 00:31:57.610\nAnd then lastly, the only thing\nworth mentioning is the event logs,\n\n674\n00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:01.770\nthe event logs in your system,\neven if you don't have this software.\n\n675\n00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:03.840\nSo for example,\nlet's say I've got a Windows server,\n\n676\n00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.240\nand it's a Core Services install.\n\n677\n00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.940\nSo all these GUI utilities,\nthey're not gonna help me, right?\n\n678\n00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.560\nNot in a Core Services install.\n\n679\n00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.960\nBut I've got my event log, and\n\n680\n00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.280\nin my Event Viewer, I'll have my\nsystem log that we can get into.\n\n681\n00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.770\nAnd hardware errors will typically\nrepresent themselves here.\n\n682\n00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:24.183\nBut if it's not a hardware issue,\nit could be a software issue.\n\n683\n00:32:24.183 --> 00:32:27.185\nAnd so I might need to look under\nmy applications and come down here.\n\n684\n00:32:27.185 --> 00:32:28.271\nAnd even under Applications,\n\n685\n00:32:28.271 --> 00:32:31.040\nyou'll see where you've got\na separate Hardware Events folder.\n\n686\n00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.810\nAnd that's where you'd see issues\nthat are popping up there with\n\n687\n00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:35.320\ncommunicating with the RAID controller and\nso on.\n\n688\n00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.650\nIt's another place to look.\n\n689\n00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:42.160\nThe only objective that I haven't\ncovered is the net use or mount command.\n\n690\n00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.380\nNet use is for mounting network drives and\nconnecting to them.\n\n691\n00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.580\nI talked about it in the troubleshooting\nnetworking episodes.\n\n692\n00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.910\nBut with net use, you're connecting to\na shared folder somewhere on the network.\n\n693\n00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:54.700\nAnd so if you have an issue there,\nthat's typically gonna come up with that.\n\n694\n00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.590\nBut you can also use it to assign\ndrive letters to a disk, and\n\n695\n00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:00.520\nyou can assign more than one\ndrive letter if you need to.\n\n696\n00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.790\nAnd that, you can use other\nthings like Disk Utility for it.\n\n697\n00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:06.080\nIn the LINUX and UNIX world,\nyou have the mount command.\n\n698\n00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.237\nAnd they don't really help you with\ntroubleshooting beyond seeing that you\n\n699\n00:33:09.237 --> 00:33:10.230\ncan't mount the disk.\n\n700\n00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:12.781\nSo if you try and mount it like normal,\nand you can't, well,\n\n701\n00:33:12.781 --> 00:33:16.870\nnow you know you can't access the disk,\nwhich you probably already knew.\n\n702\n00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:18.120\nThey don't help you find out why.\n\n703\n00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.640\nAnd so now you've gotta go a step further,\n\n704\n00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.290\nand that's where our hardware\ndiagnostics really save the day.\n\n705\n00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:24.770\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\nlot of great information.\n\n706\n00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:25.770\nYeah, I've always wondered that.\n\n707\n00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.180\nWith all the different\ncomponents in a switch fabric,\n\n708\n00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.070\nhow can you keep all of that monitored?\n\n709\n00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.480\nSo it's interesting to learn that.\n\n710\n00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.630\nNow, it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n711\n00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:36.450\nBut before we do, Don,\ndo you have any final words that\n\n712\n00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:39.850\nyou might like to impart to our viewers\nwhen it comes to troubleshooting storage?\n\n713\n00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:43.640\n&gt;&gt; Main thing, any time you set a server\nbudget, always set a budget for spares.\n\n714\n00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:48.296\nEven if you have a four-hour response time\nwarranty, you don't want to lose data.\n\n715\n00:33:48.296 --> 00:33:49.900\nYou don't wanna have\nto go to your backups.\n\n716\n00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.650\nAnything you can do to avoid going\nto your backups, you'll appreciate,\n\n717\n00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.040\ncuz it saves time.\n\n718\n00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.510\nSo when you buy a server, have a spare.\n\n719\n00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:58.961\nAnd a hot spare is nice, but there's\nnothing wrong with cold spares, too.\n\n720\n00:33:58.961 --> 00:34:02.099\nYou can have drives that you share\nacross 20 different servers,\n\n721\n00:34:02.099 --> 00:34:04.090\nbecause you wanna save some money.\n\n722\n00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:06.870\nThey sit on the shelf, and\na cold spare will actually last longer,\n\n723\n00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:08.390\ncuz the disk isn't spinning.\n\n724\n00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:11.375\nOn a hot spare, the disk is actually\nspinning while it sits there.\n\n725\n00:34:11.375 --> 00:34:14.830\nAnd so that does wear it down over time,\nusually a long, long time,\n\n726\n00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:16.010\nbut it can happen.\n\n727\n00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.640\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don.\n\n728\n00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.760\nWell, thank you for being here.\n\n729\n00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.480\nAnd thank you to you, the viewer watching.\n\n730\n00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.450\nWe hope you've enjoyed it.\n\n731\n00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:23.510\nSinging out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n732\n00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:24.400\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n733\n00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.367\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n734\n00:34:25.367 --> 00:34:32.285\n[MUSIC]\n\n735\n00:34:32.285 -->

00:00:08.382\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.382 --> 00:00:12.105\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:14.385\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:16.435\nITProTV, I'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:16.435 --> 00:00:19.125\nAnd in today's episode we're\ncontinuing through our series in\n\n8\n00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:22.475\nCompTIA Server Plus SK0-004 and\n\n9\n00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:25.315\njoining us back in the studios again\nis none other than Mr Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:26.355\nDon, how are you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:27.535\n&gt;&gt; I am doing just well, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:27.535 --> 00:00:30.195\nTo wrap up our troubleshooting series for\n\n13\n00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:35.870\nthe CompTIA Server+ certification and\nthe last topic we have is well, security.\n\n14\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.450\nWe're gonna be troubleshooting security\nrelated issues, and before you run away\n\n15\n00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.520\nwith this, don't think that the security's\njust hackers getting the system.\n\n16\n00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.330\nThere's any number of failures that all\nkind of fall under that umbrella of\n\n17\n00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.230\nsecurity.\n\n18\n00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.500\nAnd we need to understand\nwhat is available to us,\n\n19\n00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.920\nto help ensure those things don't happen.\n\n20\n00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.390\nThere's some just basic steps and\nprocesses we can go through to make sure\n\n21\n00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.140\nthing work the way that\nthey're supposed to.\n\n22\n00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.260\nAnd that's what we're gonna take\na look at right here in this episode.\n\n23\n00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.100\nThe first thing that I wanna start\ntalking about is file integrity.\n\n24\n00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.600\nFile integrity is where we're dealing\nwith files that are effectively damaged.\n\n25\n00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.440\nThey aren't the way they intend to be.\n\n26\n00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.210\nNow what do I mean by damaged?\n\n27\n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.630\nIt could mean that they're damaged\nin a way that makes them unreadable.\n\n28\n00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.915\nSo maybe I have a Word document and\nI'm trying to open it and\n\n29\n00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:20.865\nit just, it won't open, just corrupt.\n\n30\n00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:21.373\nAnd that's it.\n\n31\n00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:24.815\nWell, why is that?\n\n32\n00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:26.105\nThere's a number of things\nthat can lead to that.\n\n33\n00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:27.805\nUsually we think failing hard drive.\n\n34\n00:01:27.805 --> 00:01:29.545\nA failing hard drive can lead to that.\n\n35\n00:01:29.545 --> 00:01:32.925\nBut, where did that file come\nfrom in the first place?\n\n36\n00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:37.490\nMore often than not, the way that it was\ntransferred to our disk could be at fault.\n\n37\n00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.610\nAnd now the disk was damaged in transit.\n\n38\n00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.140\nIt might be fine wherever\nit's stored originally but\n\n39\n00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.250\nin transit to getting placed onto\nour drive it got damaged somehow.\n\n40\n00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.320\nSo that's one type of damage.\n\n41\n00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.990\nAnother type of damage is intentional.\n\n42\n00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.365\nThat I may have a Word document\nthat is what I wanted and\n\n43\n00:01:53.365 --> 00:01:56.515\nI could open it and\nit works just fine but a hacker or\n\n44\n00:01:56.515 --> 00:02:00.669\nsomebody else is has gotten ahold\nof it and stuck a macro in there.\n\n45\n00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:03.680\nA macro that when I launch the Word\ndocument in the background\n\n46\n00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.280\nit's emailing my keystrokes\nafter somebody else, right?\n\n47\n00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.870\nI don't see the file as damaged,\nI can open the file, I can read it.\n\n48\n00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.930\nBut it's doing other\nthings in the background.\n\n49\n00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.560\nEffectively a Trojan Horse like\na malware or a virus, right?\n\n50\n00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.590\nThat 's damage to the file also.\n\n51\n00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.140\nAnything that modifies a file\nbeyond what we expect it to be\n\n52\n00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.760\nis an integrity issue, right,\na file integrity issue.\n\n53\n00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.940\nNow, on the security side, we can leverage\nthings like malware and antivirus.\n\n54\n00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.180\nAny kind of intrusion prevention or\n\n55\n00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.950\nintrusion detection system\nshould be able to see that.\n\n56\n00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.150\nAnd we see steps like that\nin our software anyway.\n\n57\n00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.240\nIf you open up a Word document\nMicrosoft Word blocks macros by default.\n\n58\n00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.890\nSo if I'm expecting to see some letter and\n\n59\n00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.680\nI get a message about a macro that's a red\nflag for me, hey that shouldn't be there.\n\n60\n00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.590\nBut is that happening on a server,\nnot normally.\n\n61\n00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.970\nOn a server we wouldn't be\nrunning Microsoft Word.\n\n62\n00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.820\nIt might be a file server and this\nmalicious document is stored on the file\n\n63\n00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.250\nserver but it's not actually\nbeing opened on the file server.\n\n64\n00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.380\nSo, is the server going to see that\na file is damaged and malicious?\n\n65\n00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.520\nNot normally.\n\n66\n00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.200\nSo what steps can we take on the server\nto be able to prevent that stuff?\n\n67\n00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.760\nWell, you can run antivirus scans.\n\n68\n00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.470\nYou can have software, or hardware for\n\n69\n00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.890\nthat matter, that is inspecting these\nfiles as they're deposited on the server.\n\n70\n00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.780\nAnd if they're infected it stops now.\n\n71\n00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.260\nAnd as they're being read off of\nthe server we can inspect them or\n\n72\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.880\nwe can just do timed scans every so\noften you can run those right.\n\n73\n00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.885\nOn the software side there's any number\nof companies like Trend Micro and\n\n74\n00:03:34.885 --> 00:03:38.670\nSophos Antivirus that make software that\ncan run on your Windows and Linux and\n\n75\n00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.030\nMac servers and actually scan all\nthe files on there periodically.\n\n76\n00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.220\nOn the hardware side there's companies\nlike Barracuda where they have the network\n\n77\n00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.370\nfirewalls that will scan the traffic\nas it passes over the network.\n\n78\n00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.640\nAnd that used to be a problem\nbecause what if traffic's encrypted,\n\n79\n00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.910\nhow can it scan that?\n\n80\n00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.390\nBut now they've got where if it's internal\ntraffic you can take your internal\n\n81\n00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.140\ncertificates and\nload them on the device so\n\n82\n00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.990\nit's actually able to decrypt it, scan it,\nand then reencrypt it and send it along.\n\n83\n00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.680\nIt's kind of a man in the middle\nattack but in a good way.\n\n84\n00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.760\nIt's a man in the middle repair,\nor something like that, but\n\n85\n00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.220\nthose kind of devices can really\nhelp to ensure that doesn't happen.\n\n86\n00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.370\nWe can also do it manually\nourselves though.\n\n87\n00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.110\nMore and more sites are starting\nto do checksums with a file, so,\n\n88\n00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.630\nyou go to download some file, and when you\ngo to download it, they provide a checksum\n\n89\n00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.820\nfor you, so, for example,\nhere I'm on Red Hat's web page and\n\n90\n00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.000\nI'm about to download a copy\nof Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n91\n00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.850\nI wanna download an ISO from them, right?\n\n92\n00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.920\nAnd so when I come down here to download\nand I see all my Download Now buttons so\n\n93\n00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.290\nI can come and find the DVD right here.\n\n94\n00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.320\nSo the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3\nBinary DVD, I wanna download it.\n\n95\n00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.309\nAnd then right here it gives\nme a SHA-256 checksum.\n\n96\n00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:48.570\nAll right now what is this checksum?\n\n97\n00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.910\nWhat it means is they ran\nthe SHA-256 algorithm against it\n\n98\n00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:54.860\nto generate a file hash.\n\n99\n00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.870\nA hash of that file as it was in\nits original state at Red Hat,\n\n100\n00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.770\nat their server farm.\n\n101\n00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.022\nAnd then I can download the ISO.\n\n102\n00:05:04.022 --> 00:05:08.400\nI can download it from them, I can\ndownload it from another server on my\n\n103\n00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.530\nnetwork, I can go to a bit torrent\nsite and torrent it, right?\n\n104\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.530\nAnd once I get it,\nhow do I know if it's been tampered with?\n\n105\n00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.720\nOr if it just got damaged in transit?\n\n106\n00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.540\nIf I'm pulling from another one of my\nservers it's probably fine, if I download\n\n107\n00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.210\nit from the Internet, something could've\ngone wrong during the download.\n\n108\n00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.460\nIf I'm pulling from a torrent site well,\nall sorts of stuff could happen.\n\n109\n00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.370\nSomebody could've intentionally taken\nthat disk and injected code into it, so\n\n110\n00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.140\nthat when it set up a boot\nloader on my system\n\n111\n00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.910\nit would already have\na root kit as a part of it.\n\n112\n00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.390\nI wouldn't even know it was there.\n\n113\n00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.780\nThat happens.\n\n114\n00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.500\nIt's a real thing.\n\n115\n00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.040\nWell, how do we know that happened?\n\n116\n00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.040\nI could go ahead and\nget the ISO from wherever I wanted.\n\n117\n00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.760\nAnd I could run and calculate my\nown checksum on that same file, and\n\n118\n00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.740\nit should match this hash, identically.\n\n119\n00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.730\nIf it does, I know it hasn't\nbeen tampered with at all.\n\n120\n00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.520\nIf it doesn't match, I know that\nthe file is either corrupted or\n\n121\n00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.130\nbeen maliciously modified.\n\n122\n00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.150\nI am able to see that\nusing these checksums.\n\n123\n00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.100\nAnd more and\nmore operating systems have this built in.\n\n124\n00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.970\nWindows Server 2016 is the first\nMicrosoft one to have it built in, but\n\n125\n00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.350\nthere's third party utilities that\nyou can use with the older versions.\n\n126\n00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.820\nEvery Linux and Mac distro has it so\nyou can go in and\n\n127\n00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.100\ncalculate these checksums pretty easily.\n\n128\n00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.070\n&gt;&gt; Don how easy is this and feasible on a\ncomputational level to do this maybe like\n\n129\n00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.950\non file by file on something\nwhere you're storing your data.\n\n130\n00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.750\nNow obviously we would wanna run a\nchecksum on a file that we're downloading\n\n131\n00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.170\nbut how about like when you have hundreds\nor thousands, if not hundreds of thousands\n\n132\n00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.440\nof files would this be feasible to\nrun checksums against all of them?\n\n133\n00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.740\n&gt;&gt; You certainly wouldn't do it by hand.\n\n134\n00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.420\nBut there is plenty of software out\nthere that you can use that does it on\n\n135\n00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.280\na larger scale.\n\n136\n00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.980\nI mean even ancient software like RSync.\n\n137\n00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.170\nThe RSync utility in Unix all it's doing\nis comparing two different directories and\n\n138\n00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.490\nlooking at the data in there.\n\n139\n00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.590\nAnd you can tell it to use checksums, and\n\n140\n00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.490\nit'll identify there's\nbeen a modification.\n\n141\n00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.960\nIf you use third party\nservices like CrashPlan or\n\n142\n00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.870\nDropbox, that's all their doing.\n\n143\n00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.230\nThey've got hashes of all the files,\n\n144\n00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.390\nif a hash doesn't match they\nknow the file is modified.\n\n145\n00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.650\nThey need to sync it up.\n\n146\n00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.980\nSo people do that in batch.\n\n147\n00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.970\nBut from a troubleshooting perspective,\n\n148\n00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.800\nyou're normally gonna be looking\nat one file specifically.\n\n149\n00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.370\nSo a user calls up and says, hey I tried\nto open this file and it's not working.\n\n150\n00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.560\nOkay, well let's go and\nfind out what happened.\n\n151\n00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.370\nI'm gonna go and look at that file and\nI can open it just fine.\n\n152\n00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.100\nBut they are saying it's not working.\n\n153\n00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.040\nSo maybe you get them to copy it\ndown to their local computer and\n\n154\n00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.570\ncalculate a checksum, right.\n\n155\n00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.320\nCalculate the checks sum is trivial.\n\n156\n00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.740\nLet me, let's see what am I on?\n\n157\n00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.550\nI'm on a Mac.\n\n158\n00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.848\nSo on this Mac which should\nbe the same on Linux,\n\n159\n00:07:38.848 --> 00:07:42.236\nyou've got the md5 command,\nthat you can use.\n\n160\n00:07:42.236 --> 00:07:43.920\nOops, which you don't\nwant to run by itself.\n\n161\n00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.550\nIt starts creating md5 sum for\nyour entire hard drive.\n\n162\n00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.840\nSo you can use the md5 command and\nyou can specify a file.\n\n163\n00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.887\nSo for example, if I've got file.txt and\n\n164\n00:07:53.887 --> 00:07:58.840\nI do md5 File.txt, And\nI have to spell md5 right.\n\n165\n00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.779\nThere we go.\n\n166\n00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:02.850\nIt looks at it and\nit calculates an md5 hash.\n\n167\n00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.340\nSo there's the md5 hash of that file.\n\n168\n00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.550\nNow if I modify that\nfile even one little bit,\n\n169\n00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.790\nI'm just gonna add the number 1 to it,\nokay.\n\n170\n00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.130\nSo I've modified it.\n\n171\n00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.140\nWhen I rehash it,\nsee how these numbers don't match.\n\n172\n00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.200\nThis one ends in 8427e.\n\n173\n00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.160\nThis other one ends in c81d1.\n\n174\n00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.100\nThe hash is different.\n\n175\n00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.140\nThe file has been modified.\n\n176\n00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.050\nAny modification makes that hash change.\n\n177\n00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.360\nNow I know some of you are out\nthere saying, Don, MD5's not good.\n\n178\n00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.433\nRight, there's collusion attacks and other\nthings that have been proven against it,\n\n179\n00:08:35.433 --> 00:08:36.979\nso we're not supposed to use MD5 anymore.\n\n180\n00:08:36.979 --> 00:08:41.044\nAnd that's fine because we have shasum.\n\n181\n00:08:41.044 --> 00:08:43.450\nAnd shasum,\nyou can use to do the same thing but\n\n182\n00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.810\nwith the secure hashing algorithm instead.\n\n183\n00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:50.780\nmd5 is the message digest 5,\nso I can calculate a shasum.\n\n184\n00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.590\nAnd it's gonna do that.\n\n185\n00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:56.730\nNow, do be aware that shasum\ndefaults to sha 1 which\n\n186\n00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.070\nalso has a tax against it and\nhas been proven theoretically breakable.\n\n187\n00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:06.451\nSo most people have switched to\nusing sha 256 as their algorithm,\n\n188\n00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:10.452\nso you'll wanna add\na little -a 256 to do that.\n\n189\n00:09:10.452 --> 00:09:14.760\nAnd now it calculates a much bigger hash,\none that's harder to compromise.\n\n190\n00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.890\nBut it works the same way.\n\n191\n00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:20.280\nIf I go and modify that file,\neven one little bit, right?\n\n192\n00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.380\nIt's gonna change that.\n\n193\n00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:27.520\nSo if I come in here and let's just\nsay I put a 1 in there before, right?\n\n194\n00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.538\nI'm just gonna add a space after 1.\n\n195\n00:09:29.538 --> 00:09:31.530\nJust a whitespace.\n\n196\n00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:37.370\nAnd when I add that whitespace, that's\ngonna be enough to make that hash change.\n\n197\n00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:38.619\nAnd so you can look at it.\n\n198\n00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:40.880\nIt ended in dd865 before.\n\n199\n00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.188\nNow it ends in 734c.\n\n200\n00:09:43.188 --> 00:09:47.460\nAll right, so when I download that\nISO from Red Hat, I can download it.\n\n201\n00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.510\nIt might take a while, right.\n\n202\n00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.410\nAnd I have to download it,\nand I get a copy.\n\n203\n00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:55.360\nAnd then I can run this shasum on it and\ncompare it with the website.\n\n204\n00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.100\nDoes it match?\n\n205\n00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.610\nIf it does, I know I got an intact file.\n\n206\n00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.120\nI don't know if you've ever had this,\n\n207\n00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.410\nwhere you go to install\na server operating system.\n\n208\n00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:02.100\nYou boot off the CD.\n\n209\n00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.560\nYou're halfway through the install and\nit starts saying something like\n\n210\n00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.350\nstorage error, unable to write,\nor something like that.\n\n211\n00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:09.810\nWell, if it's a brand new server,\n\n212\n00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.480\nthe odds of a storage failure\nhappening are pretty low.\n\n213\n00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.380\nBut the odds of you having corrupt\ninstall media is actually pretty high.\n\n214\n00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.330\nUSB keys go bad all the time.\n\n215\n00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.550\nCDs and DVDs can get scratched.\n\n216\n00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.600\nYou can download a bad ISO and\nthen burn the bad ISO.\n\n217\n00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.390\nThen you've got a bad disk\nthat you've just created.\n\n218\n00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.680\nSo all of these are things\nthat can go wrong.\n\n219\n00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.410\nSo verifying the integrity of\nthat install media is important.\n\n220\n00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.710\nAnd when you do the install,\nlike if you were to watch our Linux+ show,\n\n221\n00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:40.330\nor any of those, or our Red Hat show for\nthat matter, when you start to install,\n\n222\n00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.590\none of the first things it does\nis it verifies the install media.\n\n223\n00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.970\nIt runs through and\nchecks the check sums on the file.\n\n224\n00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:45.730\nThat's what it's doing.\n\n225\n00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.040\nA lot of people have done this.\n\n226\n00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:48.730\nCentOs.\n\n227\n00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.050\nCentOs is the kind of\nfree version of Red Hat.\n\n228\n00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.510\nThe open source community\nversion of Red Hat, and\n\n229\n00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:59.380\nbecause they're free,\nhow do they make money?\n\n230\n00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.400\nWell, they don't, right?\n\n231\n00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.989\nSo, they really need people to help them.\n\n232\n00:11:01.989 --> 00:11:06.921\nSo when you go and download the DVD,\nthey recommend pulling it from a Torrent,\n\n233\n00:11:06.921 --> 00:11:10.750\nand it's not like Pirate Bay,\nit's a legitimate Torrent.\n\n234\n00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.020\nYou're pulling from other people that\nare also downloading at the same time,\n\n235\n00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.240\nbut how do you know you\ncan trust those people?\n\n236\n00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.470\nWell, if you have the file checksums,\nyou don't worry about it.\n\n237\n00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:24.230\nYou can download from a torrent, and\nthen you can jump over and check.\n\n238\n00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.960\nActually I just missed it there.\n\n239\n00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.070\nBut here we go.\n\n240\n00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:27.960\nHow to verify your ISO.\n\n241\n00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.490\nSo, it's got it right there.\n\n242\n00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.680\nThey've got the instructions on\ncalculating the checksum and\n\n243\n00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.760\nviewing the online checksum for it.\n\n244\n00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.363\nYou can go to any CentOS mirror.\n\n245\n00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:43.776\nSo, let's say I wanted to\ndownload it from ftp.usf.edu.\n\n246\n00:11:43.776 --> 00:11:48.310\nAnd so I'll go to them, and they have\nsent to us, and I can jump in and\n\n247\n00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.720\ndownload the ISO from here.\n\n248\n00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.200\nAnd if I download the ISO from here,\n\n249\n00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.740\nthey'll have the checksums\nright alongside the ISOs.\n\n250\n00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:03.140\nWell, If I'm downloading the checksum\nfrom the same place as the ISO,\n\n251\n00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.130\nsomebody could have modified the ISO and\nthen modified the checksums.\n\n252\n00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.880\nSo the idea is,\nyou download the ISO from one place, and\n\n253\n00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.610\nyou download the checksum from another\nplace, from two different places and\n\n254\n00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.030\nthen you can compare them together.\n\n255\n00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:18.770\nBut as I look, I'll see all these ISOs and\ntorrent files, and then right down\n\n256\n00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:23.280\nhere is the sha1 or sha256 sums, and I can\npull them up and now I've got something\n\n257\n00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.310\nthat I can verify against those disks to\nmake sure they haven't been tampered with.\n\n258\n00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.900\nAll right, so just be aware\nthat's it's easy to check for\n\n259\n00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.160\nthat kind of integrity failure.\n\n260\n00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.600\nAll right,\nother topics in security, right.\n\n261\n00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.010\nIntegrity is one part of it but\nthere's plenty of other things.\n\n262\n00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:38.980\nPrivilege escalation.\n\n263\n00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.750\nWhen you have a server,\nit's gonna run an operating system, and\n\n264\n00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.640\nthe operating system more than\nlikely has vulnerabilities in it.\n\n265\n00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.530\nA vulnerability is any weakness in\nit that somebody could exploit,\n\n266\n00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.730\nsomebody could come in and take advantage\nof to gain access to the system.\n\n267\n00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:56.800\nWell when people look for\nvulnerabilities, what they're looking for\n\n268\n00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.110\nare ones that allow you to\ndo privilege escalation.\n\n269\n00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:04.080\nWhere, instead of being a regular user,\nI become an administrator.\n\n270\n00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.350\nWhen I go to Amazon's website,\ngo to www.amazon.com,\n\n271\n00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:12.580\nI'm allowed to go to the website, I'm just\na regular user, I can read the website,\n\n272\n00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.070\nI can view it, I can search for\nproducts and buy stuff.\n\n273\n00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.430\nI can't edit the website,\nI'm not an administrator.\n\n274\n00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:19.700\nBut, what if there was\nsomething I could do.\n\n275\n00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.390\nSome way I could mess with the webpage,\n\n276\n00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.590\nwhere all of a sudden I\nbecame the administrator.\n\n277\n00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.854\nAnd now I could edit the page and\nnow I made it where all of Amazon's sales\n\n278\n00:13:27.854 --> 00:13:30.262\nwent to my bank account or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n279\n00:13:30.262 --> 00:13:31.410\nThat would be bad.\n\n280\n00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.139\nI wouldn't want that to happen.\n\n281\n00:13:34.465 --> 00:13:35.870\nWell I don't know if you want.\n\n282\n00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.170\nAmazon sales go into my bank account.\n\n283\n00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.260\nThat might be a good thing.\n\n284\n00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.410\nBut not for them obviously.\n\n285\n00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:40.680\nSo they wouldn't want that to happen.\n\n286\n00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.577\nSo we've got to make sure\nthat we don't allow that.\n\n287\n00:13:42.577 --> 00:13:44.230\nThat we don't allow privilege escalation.\n\n288\n00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:49.540\nAnd unfortunately it's incredibly\ndifficult for us to fix that, to stop\n\n289\n00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.280\nthat before it happens because if you were\nrunning something like Microsoft Windows.\n\n290\n00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.530\nIt's closed source.\n\n291\n00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.558\nSo can you review the source\ncode of Windows and\n\n292\n00:13:56.558 --> 00:13:59.011\nstart to identify privilege\nescalation bugs in there?\n\n293\n00:13:59.011 --> 00:14:02.000\nNo, you count on them to do it.\n\n294\n00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.911\nThe same thing goes for\na lot of open source solutions.\n\n295\n00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:09.681\nI might have an open-source package\nthat is very reliable like CentOS,\n\n296\n00:14:09.681 --> 00:14:14.860\nCentOS is used by millions of people\naround the world, it's great software.\n\n297\n00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.940\nBut do you have time to\nreview all that code?\n\n298\n00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.190\nYou're hoping that other people have\ntime to review the code and look for\n\n299\n00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:24.620\nthose bugs and weaknesses, and sometimes\nthey do and sometimes they don't.\n\n300\n00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:29.550\nSo all we can hope for,\nis that somebody somewhere else,\n\n301\n00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.740\ngets hit by that vulnerability first, and\nthen an update gets pushed through it.\n\n302\n00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.049\nAnd that's where security\nresearchers spend all their time.\n\n303\n00:14:36.049 --> 00:14:38.902\nThey find a bug, they report it,\nthe bug gets fixed, and\n\n304\n00:14:38.902 --> 00:14:41.166\nthen it gets announced to the world,\nright?\n\n305\n00:14:41.166 --> 00:14:44.549\nThey always wait like a month or something\nbefore they announce it to the world, so\n\n306\n00:14:44.549 --> 00:14:47.760\nthat they get fixed before people\ncan take advantage of it, right?\n\n307\n00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.990\nThe difference between a vulnerability and\nan exploit is,\n\n308\n00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:54.490\na vulnerability is a weakness that\nhasn't necessarily been used yet.\n\n309\n00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:57.390\nWe don't necessarily have a way to\nuse it to take advantage of it.\n\n310\n00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:01.880\nBut an exploit is a vulnerability where\nsomebody has found a way to use it and\n\n311\n00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.370\nthey've released it into the wild\nwhere they can advantage of it now.\n\n312\n00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.540\nSo we absolutely don't want exploits.\n\n313\n00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.500\nVulnerabilities are gonna happen,\nexploits can be prevented.\n\n314\n00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.320\nApplying all your updates,\ndoing all your security updates and\n\n315\n00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.440\nputting them in place, but\n\n316\n00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.040\nlet's say that we haven't been doing our\nupdates, how do we know this happened?\n\n317\n00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:17.820\nYour logs.\n\n318\n00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.830\nYou gotta go to your log messages.\n\n319\n00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:21.200\nLook in your CIS log.\n\n320\n00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.000\nYou can use other software to help\ndiagnosis, intrusion detection\n\n321\n00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.510\nsoftware will help you to spot whether\nthere has been an intrusion like this.\n\n322\n00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.350\nHost base or\nnetwork base ideas will spot it and\n\n323\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.580\nyou'll see that information is\nalso kinda found in your logs.\n\n324\n00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.430\n&gt;&gt; So, Don, if I'm sitting at that\nmanagement system and I'm looking at those\n\n325\n00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:41.170\nlogs, what is it that I'm actually gonna\nbe looking for inside of those logs?\n\n326\n00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.850\n&gt;&gt; You're looking for two things.\n\n327\n00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.400\nOne, you're looking for\nadministrator log ins.\n\n328\n00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.140\nYou should see entries in there that says,\nsuch and such administrator logged in.\n\n329\n00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.241\nOr, such and\nsuch person performed an action.\n\n330\n00:15:51.241 --> 00:15:55.870\nAnd you expect to see the ones that you,\nand your team, are doing.\n\n331\n00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.853\nBut if you see outliers.\n\n332\n00:15:56.853 --> 00:15:59.263\nIf I see an administrator\nlogged in at 3 AM, but\n\n333\n00:15:59.263 --> 00:16:03.430\nI know nobody was on the clock at 3 AM,\nthat probably wasn't my team.\n\n334\n00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:07.540\nAnd if the source IP address is some\nexternal IP I'm not familiar with,\n\n335\n00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.780\nthat's not my team.\n\n336\n00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.850\nI know that that access came from outside\nand it's probably not legitimate, right?\n\n337\n00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:13.570\nSomebody's managed to\ncompromise that credential.\n\n338\n00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:14.630\nThat's one thing.\n\n339\n00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:17.880\nThe other thing I'm looking for, and\nthis is going to sound funny, is nothing.\n\n340\n00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:22.050\nAnd what I mean by\nnothing is an empty log.\n\n341\n00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:26.570\nA good hacker, the first target\nis gonna be your log file.\n\n342\n00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.360\nA hacker needs to be able\nto cover their tracks.\n\n343\n00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.210\nThey need to hide the fact\nthat they were there.\n\n344\n00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.380\nAnd the way they're gonna do that\nis by erasing your log files.\n\n345\n00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.850\nCuz then they can get in and do whatever\nthey want, access anything they want and\n\n346\n00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:37.070\nthen erase the log files.\n\n347\n00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.520\nAnd ditch out.\n\n348\n00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.480\nAnd now you've got no record of it.\n\n349\n00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.060\nSo if you see something like that,\n\n350\n00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.250\na gap in your log files, that doesn't\nmean your server ran perfectly for\n\n351\n00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.330\nthat period of time, no server reports\nnothing for a long period of time,\n\n352\n00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.820\nyou're going to see this gap, and that'll\nlet you know somebody has erased or\n\n353\n00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.830\npurged that log file, those\nare things you need to watch out for.\n\n354\n00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.500\n&gt;&gt; Now Don if I am in those logs and\nI come in,\n\n355\n00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.790\ndoesn't clearing a log generate an entry?\n\n356\n00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.590\nI know in Windows it does,\nI'm not sure in Linux if it does.\n\n357\n00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:07.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it can, unless they've\nactually compromised that file.\n\n358\n00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:10.790\nBecause they can go a step further and\ndo that.\n\n359\n00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:14.850\nBut most systems will have what's called\nan audit policy and an audit policy\n\n360\n00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:19.180\nwill allow you to track access to files\nand you get that stuff in the log.\n\n361\n00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:25.130\nSo if I have a shared folder and somebody\nkeeps going in and changing a file.\n\n362\n00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.290\nAnd I want to find out how I\ncan turn on that audit and\n\n363\n00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:28.770\nI'll get additional\ninformation in the logs.\n\n364\n00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.630\nThings like somebody cleared the logs.\n\n365\n00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.380\nThat should be entered in there but\nthere are ways to defeat that message and\n\n366\n00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.070\nget that out of there.\n\n367\n00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:38.420\nThe thing about auditing is it's\nusually turned off by default.\n\n368\n00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.180\nSo let me just show you an example here.\n\n369\n00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:44.660\nIn Windows it has very little auditing\nactually turned on by default.\n\n370\n00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:49.280\nSo if I come in and create a new folder,\nfor example, I'll just whip up a folder\n\n371\n00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:55.500\nhere called Test, and I'll pull up its\nproperties, and I'll dig under Security,\n\n372\n00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:00.950\nand I'll go under Advanced, and I'll go to\nAuditing, and there's nothing here, right.\n\n373\n00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:03.320\nSo it's not auditing\nthis folder by default,\n\n374\n00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.700\nWindows has a very small amount of\nauditing that amounts to basically log in,\n\n375\n00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.330\nfor authentication auditing that's turned\non by default so I'll see when somebody\n\n376\n00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:14.430\nlogs in and logs out of the system, or\nif they fail to login, I'll see that.\n\n377\n00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:19.690\nBut I can take any folder and\ndon't customize how I do auditing.\n\n378\n00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.270\nAnd I can order for individual user,\naccessing these resource.\n\n379\n00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:28.309\nBut if I suspect Wes is doing something\nI don't wanna create a log of every\n\n380\n00:18:28.309 --> 00:18:33.290\ntime Wes touches a file in here or\nI might just do everyone, right?\n\n381\n00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:37.480\nAny time anyone accesses\nthe folder I wanna know about it.\n\n382\n00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.850\nAnd maybe I don't wanna know\nabout reads or whatever.\n\n383\n00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.330\nI just wanna know about writes.\n\n384\n00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.200\nAnytime somebody changes\nsomething inside of there.\n\n385\n00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:48.210\nI could throw modify in but modify\ntechnically includes reads cuz it updates\n\n386\n00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.420\nthe last access time\ntime stamp on the file.\n\n387\n00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:55.740\nBut so you can grab each of these or\nwhatever that you want to monitor.\n\n388\n00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.340\nJust be aware that if you get too\nover encompassing with your audits,\n\n389\n00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.570\nit'll fill up your logs.\n\n390\n00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.410\nIt's a ton of data, so you wanna try and\nbe as specific as possible.\n\n391\n00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:08.770\nAnd the other thing is when you start\nauditing like this it's gonna ask you\n\n392\n00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:13.600\ndo you wanna audit successes,\nfailures, or both?\n\n393\n00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.084\nAnd there's a common mistake that people\nmake when they get started in security,\n\n394\n00:19:17.084 --> 00:19:18.561\nwhich is to monitor for failures.\n\n395\n00:19:18.561 --> 00:19:21.150\nI wanna see when somebody try to do\nsomething they weren't supposed to do.\n\n396\n00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:26.580\nWell, let me tell you in the security\nworld, a failure is a good thing.\n\n397\n00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.830\nSomebody tried to something they weren't\nsupposed to do and they were stopped.\n\n398\n00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.120\nGreat!\nThe system worked\n\n399\n00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.330\nthe way it's supposed to.\n\n400\n00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.600\nNow if somebody tried to do something\nthey weren't supposed to do, and\n\n401\n00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.550\nit worked, that's a success.\n\n402\n00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:40.170\nIt worked.\n\n403\n00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:41.780\nThey did it, right?\n\n404\n00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.850\nIf somebody tries to log\ninto my system 50 times, and\n\n405\n00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.160\n49 times they get a wrong password,\nI don't care.\n\n406\n00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.910\nBut the 50th time they got the right\npassword, they got in, I care about that.\n\n407\n00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:53.330\nNow they're in and they can do damage.\n\n408\n00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.810\nSo successes are normally\nwhat we wanna monitor.\n\n409\n00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:00.330\nFailures are nice if you're looking for\npeople doing brute force attacks.\n\n410\n00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.970\nRight, or\nif you just wanna educate people,\n\n411\n00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:05.310\nlike hey I noticed you tried to access\nthis folder, you're not allowed, stop it.\n\n412\n00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.780\nBut it doesn't really help.\n\n413\n00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:12.470\nThat's not gonna be any significant\noccurrence on your network.\n\n414\n00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:17.410\nBut a success, now I can see, hey,\nsomebody was on the website at 3 AM and\n\n415\n00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:19.980\nthey managed to write a file\nto the web directory.\n\n416\n00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.890\nNobody's supposed to be able\nto write to the web directory.\n\n417\n00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:22.570\nHow did they do that?\n\n418\n00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.590\nAnd now you can start\ntroubleshoot that down.\n\n419\n00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.340\nWordPress is a great example.\n\n420\n00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:30.140\nIf you've got a Linux Server running\nApache and you've got WordPress on it,\n\n421\n00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.800\nthere's a few directories in\nWordPress that allow write access but\n\n422\n00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.310\nmost of them are read only.\n\n423\n00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.555\nBecause people were viewing pages,\nbut hackers will find exploits,\n\n424\n00:20:37.555 --> 00:20:40.250\nwhere they escalate their\nprivileges to become root, and\n\n425\n00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:43.715\nnow they're writing to that directory,\nand they're changing the site,\n\n426\n00:20:43.715 --> 00:20:46.301\nand you can spot that by keeping\nauto logs of the system.\n\n427\n00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.433\nAll right,\nthat also comes down to file integrity,\n\n428\n00:20:50.433 --> 00:20:53.718\ncuz if you start modifying files, you\nshould notice that the files have changed,\n\n429\n00:20:53.718 --> 00:20:55.493\nif the file size has changed, or whatever.\n\n430\n00:20:55.493 --> 00:20:58.100\nI know, for our website,\nfor the ITProTV website,\n\n431\n00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:02.670\nwe actually have a little system that has\ndone hashes of every file on the system.\n\n432\n00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:05.700\nAnd anytime a file changes,\nit notifies us.\n\n433\n00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.500\nNow, it might be us that made the change.\n\n434\n00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.695\nWe get that a lot.\n\n435\n00:21:08.695 --> 00:21:10.685\nBut at least we know.\n\n436\n00:21:10.685 --> 00:21:12.665\nAnd if just in the middle of\nthe day all of the sudden we get,\n\n437\n00:21:12.665 --> 00:21:14.665\nhey this file changed, that's a red flag.\n\n438\n00:21:14.665 --> 00:21:16.545\nWe should know, hey we didn't change that.\n\n439\n00:21:16.545 --> 00:21:18.325\nAnd those types of systems\nare getting to be more and\n\n440\n00:21:18.325 --> 00:21:24.455\nmore common as part of\nan Intrusion Detection System, an IDS.\n\n441\n00:21:24.455 --> 00:21:27.885\nNow one topic that CompTIA\ncalls out that I really\n\n442\n00:21:28.965 --> 00:21:31.500\nenjoy is applications will not load.\n\n443\n00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.910\nSo if you're trying to run\nan application and it won't load.\n\n444\n00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.240\nIs that a security problem or\na software problem?\n\n445\n00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.440\nDo I need to troubleshoot\nsoftware on this one?\n\n446\n00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.420\nI'm trying to run Microsoft Word and\nit won't run.\n\n447\n00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.160\nWell, great.\n\n448\n00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.260\nCall me when you have a server problem.\n\n449\n00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.050\nThat's the response.\n\n450\n00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:52.280\nBut, there is a great technology out\nthere called application whitelisting.\n\n451\n00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:57.270\nAnd I wish, I wish everybody used\napplication white listing but they don't.\n\n452\n00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:01.550\nBut if you are using application white\nlisting, you can run into scenarios where\n\n453\n00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:03.520\nyour end users are unable to\nrun their applications and\n\n454\n00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.080\nyou end up right here\ntroubleshooting security.\n\n455\n00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.460\nSo that's why it's in this section.\n\n456\n00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.690\nSo if you've never heard of\napplication whitelisting,\n\n457\n00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:14.530\nwhen we have a computer and\nyou're running antivirus, right?\n\n458\n00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.350\nWhat you're doing is you've got a computer\nthat can run any program you want.\n\n459\n00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:18.750\nYou can run whatever the heck you want.\n\n460\n00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.960\nAnd then you have an antivirus that says,\n\n461\n00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.870\nhere's some things that you can't run,\nright.\n\n462\n00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.330\nSo we allow everything except for\nthese programs.\n\n463\n00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:32.060\nAnd the problem is that except\nlist It can't stay up-to-date,\n\n464\n00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:36.070\nthe attackers are advancing way too fast,\ncoming out with new attacks,\n\n465\n00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:40.470\nnew vulnerabilities, and viruses to\npush out, you can't keep it up to date.\n\n466\n00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:44.660\nAnd so the virus definitions are out\nof date the moment they're made, and\n\n467\n00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:49.140\nthe antivirus vendors fall further and\nfurther behind from being useful right.\n\n468\n00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.350\nSo instead, we can flip things around.\n\n469\n00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.250\nAnd we could say, you know what?\n\n470\n00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:54.720\nI'm gonna block everything.\n\n471\n00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.440\nI'm not gonna allow any software\nrun on my computer except\n\n472\n00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.890\nthis list of software I approve.\n\n473\n00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:03.460\nNow that's a different,\ndifferent way of looking at things, right?\n\n474\n00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.150\nHow many different programs\nyou run on your computer?\n\n475\n00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.360\nAnd how often do you install\nprograms on your computer?\n\n476\n00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.010\nNow on a desktop, you might have\na good argument here like, hey,\n\n477\n00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.910\nat home I've got Steam and I'll load\na different video game every week and so\n\n478\n00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.580\nI don't wanna have to deal with some\nexception list to allow those programs in.\n\n479\n00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:23.330\nBut on a server, how often are you\nloading new software on your server?\n\n480\n00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.060\nUsually never.\n\n481\n00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:30.390\nI build the server to create\na particular purpose, and\n\n482\n00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.200\nI don't mess with it again\nuntil I decommission it.\n\n483\n00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.540\nI might do updates, but\nif I'm building up a web sever,\n\n484\n00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:40.150\nI might bring up Red Hat\nwith Apache maybe Engine X.\n\n485\n00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.820\nAnd a couple other little components, and\nI stick it in the network and off it goes.\n\n486\n00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:47.040\nAnd aside from software updates I'm\nnot gonna load anymore software on it.\n\n487\n00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.300\nThat's a web sever.\n\n488\n00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.231\nIf I need to bring up a mail server,\nthat's gonna be a different server.\n\n489\n00:23:50.231 --> 00:23:54.737\nSo I can create an application\nwhitelist that says Here's the programs\n\n490\n00:23:54.737 --> 00:23:55.797\nallowed to run.\n\n491\n00:23:55.797 --> 00:23:58.936\nApache is allowed to run,\nNginx is allowed to run, and\n\n492\n00:23:58.936 --> 00:24:03.510\nif somebody tries to throw a virus, or\na root kit, or tries to execute some shell\n\n493\n00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:07.770\nscript, if it's not in my white list,\nit's not allowed to run, right?\n\n494\n00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:10.600\nA great, very effective way to stop\nunknown attacks on the network,\n\n495\n00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.959\nI wish everybody was able to do this.\n\n496\n00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.750\nBut, it can get challenging.\n\n497\n00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:17.460\nAnd here's the challenging part.\n\n498\n00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.710\nLet's use a workstation as an example.\n\n499\n00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:20.215\nI have a workstation, and\n\n500\n00:24:20.215 --> 00:24:24.465\nit's running Windows 10 with Office\nwhatever the current version is.\n\n501\n00:24:24.465 --> 00:24:25.185\nWhat is it, 2016?\n\n502\n00:24:25.185 --> 00:24:25.730\n&gt;&gt; 2016.\n\n503\n00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:26.787\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so Office 2016.\n\n504\n00:24:26.787 --> 00:24:31.757\nIt's hard to keep, so I've got\nOffice 2016, I create a whitelist,\n\n505\n00:24:31.757 --> 00:24:35.044\nand I whitelist Word and\nExcel and PowerPoint and\n\n506\n00:24:35.044 --> 00:24:41.410\nwhatever other software Office comes with\nthese days, and then it's running fine.\n\n507\n00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:44.370\nWell, a few weeks later,\nMicrosoft pushes out an update and\n\n508\n00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:47.280\nthe client downloads the update cuz\nwe're good about doing our updates.\n\n509\n00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.690\nAnd all the sudden Word wont run anymore.\n\n510\n00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.420\nThey call me up, hey Don,\nI can't run Word, I try to run and\n\n511\n00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.348\nit says application can't run.\n\n512\n00:24:53.348 --> 00:24:56.335\nWhat happened?\n\n513\n00:24:56.335 --> 00:25:00.753\nWell, when we do an application whitelist,\nyou can't just do it by file name.\n\n514\n00:25:00.753 --> 00:25:07.154\nIf I create an application whitelist and\nI say, winword.exe is okay,\n\n515\n00:25:07.154 --> 00:25:11.649\nor writer.sh, or\nwhatever it is that I've got.\n\n516\n00:25:11.649 --> 00:25:15.774\nIf I say that's okay, anybody could\ncreate a virus or a root kit,\n\n517\n00:25:15.774 --> 00:25:18.510\nand give it that name, and run it.\n\n518\n00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:19.160\nAnd now it'll run.\n\n519\n00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.610\nSo you can't trust a name.\n\n520\n00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:23.060\nSo, how do the application whitelist work?\n\n521\n00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:26.420\nChecksums, checksums like I talked\nabout at the beginning of this episode.\n\n522\n00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.989\nIt runs a checksum of winword.exe and\nit creates a hash.\n\n523\n00:25:29.989 --> 00:25:33.994\nAnd now, anytime a program runs,\nit just runs a hash to the program, and\n\n524\n00:25:33.994 --> 00:25:36.503\ncompares it and it says, that's Word.\n\n525\n00:25:36.503 --> 00:25:39.737\nIt doesn't care what directory it's in,\nit doesn't care what name it has,\n\n526\n00:25:39.737 --> 00:25:42.450\nit doesn't care about any of that\nas long as the hash is the same.\n\n527\n00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:45.860\nAnd that's why we don't use MD5 anymore,\ncuz there's collision attacks you can do\n\n528\n00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:49.350\nwhere you'd have two different files that\ngenerate the same hash, that's bad, right?\n\n529\n00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:52.470\nBut if you're doing SHA-256,\nthat's not gonna happen.\n\n530\n00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:56.904\nAnd so, we can have one application that's\nwhitelisted but when an update comes out,\n\n531\n00:25:56.904 --> 00:25:59.200\nthe file changes, doesn't it?\n\n532\n00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.890\nSometimes, not always but sometimes.\n\n533\n00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:04.760\nAnd if the file changes,\nthe hash changes and now it's blocked.\n\n534\n00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:10.130\nSo, every time the application gets\nupdated I've got to update my whitelist.\n\n535\n00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:11.965\nThat's the challenge of\napplication whitelisting,\n\n536\n00:26:11.965 --> 00:26:14.260\nand that's why people don't\nlike to do it on work stations.\n\n537\n00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.032\nThey say [SOUND] it's such a pain,\nI'm not gonna do it.\n\n538\n00:26:17.032 --> 00:26:21.553\nBut on a server, where you've got\nan update interval, you've got like a down\n\n539\n00:26:21.553 --> 00:26:26.077\ntime Window schedule every month for\nupdates and you're testing your updates\n\n540\n00:26:26.077 --> 00:26:30.051\nahead of time, you can calculate and\npreapprove those checksums and\n\n541\n00:26:30.051 --> 00:26:35.180\nthen when you do the update, it's just\nseamless and you keep running, right?\n\n542\n00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:40.190\nApplication whitelist work great\non servers, okay, they really do.\n\n543\n00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:41.780\nAnother technology that\ngoes along with it, and\n\n544\n00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.650\nI don't have enough time to\nget into it in this episode,\n\n545\n00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:47.240\nare technologies like SELinux,\nthe Security-Enhanced Linux,\n\n546\n00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.445\nwhere we restrict what directories\nprograms have access to.\n\n547\n00:26:50.445 --> 00:26:52.470\nI'll talk more about that in part two.\n\n548\n00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:54.640\nBut, on the application whitelist side,\nmore and\n\n549\n00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.270\nmore vendors are building this in.\n\n550\n00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:58.850\nNow, in Windows if I wanna look at this,\nthere is a way to get at it from\n\n551\n00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:02.210\nthe menus, I can never remember it so\nI always do sccpol.mse.\n\n552\n00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:05.650\nThat's the security\npolicy Microsoft snap in.\n\n553\n00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:09.730\nSo, I'm gonna bring that up and in\nthe security policy for a Windows Server,\n\n554\n00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:13.740\nyou'll see all sorts of things in here\nlike local policies and other things.\n\n555\n00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:17.210\nBut what I'm looking for is this guy here,\nApplication Control Policies.\n\n556\n00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:21.030\nAnd when you go into that folder,\nyou'll see Microsoft App Blocker.\n\n557\n00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:24.110\nMicrosoft App Blocker is their\napplication whitelisting service.\n\n558\n00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:30.270\nI can create a whitelist that then lets me\ndictate what is allowed and what isn't.\n\n559\n00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.440\nAnd you do it by creating rules.\n\n560\n00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.770\nAnd the nice part about making it here is\nI can make it in a group policy object,\n\n561\n00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:36.550\nand I can apply it.\n\n562\n00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.480\nI might have 50 web servers.\n\n563\n00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.130\nAnd so, I define one set of rules, and\nI push it out to all 50 web servers.\n\n564\n00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:45.370\nSo I don't have to do this over and\nover and over again for each machine.\n\n565\n00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:47.250\nAnd when you configure the rule,\n\n566\n00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:52.150\nyou can specify whether you're tracking\njust executables or Windows installers,\n\n567\n00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:56.580\nscripts, packages from their app\nstore that somebody somewhere uses.\n\n568\n00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:00.340\nSo you can really start to specify\nthat stuff, and then whether or\n\n569\n00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:03.550\nnot you're in enforcing or\nauditing only, right?\n\n570\n00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:05.790\nAnd then after that, we can go through and\n\n571\n00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.620\nstart to dictate whether we have\na particular application we wanna track.\n\n572\n00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.800\nNow, I do like that\nthey also do DLL rules,\n\n573\n00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:15.640\ncuz dynamic link libraries, same thing in\nLinux where you have regular libraries,\n\n574\n00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.290\nthat those libraries can be attacked.\n\n575\n00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:19.770\nThey are effectively executables.\n\n576\n00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:21.620\nYou just don't run them directly.\n\n577\n00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.170\nSo if they get modified,\nthey can compromise the system too.\n\n578\n00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.140\nBut you can come in and configure this.\n\n579\n00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:30.860\nAnd once you get it set up, you can start\nto approve individual applications and\n\n580\n00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.270\ndictate what's allowed to run and\nwhat's not.\n\n581\n00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:37.419\nIn our executable rules is where we can\ncome in and actually define the programs,\n\n582\n00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:41.830\nand you can specify publishers,\nexceptions.\n\n583\n00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:45.900\nIt will take the hash for you, and you\ncan add additional hashes as new updates\n\n584\n00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.910\ncome out, and\nyou can provide that functionality.\n\n585\n00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:51.950\nSo, if you wanna learn more about it,\ncheck out Microsoft's App Blocker.\n\n586\n00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:52.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don.\n\n587\n00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:53.970\nWell, there's a lot of great information.\n\n588\n00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.520\nAnd maybe you're following\nalong with the objectives and\n\n589\n00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.760\nyou'll probably realize that, well,\nwe've got a lot more to go but\n\n590\n00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.400\nwe do not have the time on the clock for\nthis episode.\n\n591\n00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.560\nBut before we go in to a part two,\nand sign out, Don,\n\n592\n00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.310\ndo you have any additional words?\n\n593\n00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:09.540\n&gt;&gt; Just remember that every\ntime you increase security,\n\n594\n00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.870\nit does make people's jobs harder,\nit makes it harder to access the system.\n\n595\n00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:13.970\nBut it's a trade-off, right?\n\n596\n00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:17.280\nIn exchange for a little inconvenience,\nyou get more security and in this day and\n\n597\n00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.340\nage, it's typically worth it.\n\n598\n00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:24.040\nBut you don't wanna go too far, there does\ncome a point where you make the system so\n\n599\n00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.990\nsecure people can't do their job anymore.\n\n600\n00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:30.200\nSo, always think about the work that\npeople have to do just to get done.\n\n601\n00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.292\nYour company needs to be able to\nmake money to stay in business.\n\n602\n00:29:32.292 --> 00:29:35.878\nSo always keep that in mind as you\napply various security policies.\n\n603\n00:29:35.878 --> 00:29:37.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\nwell thank you for being here.\n\n604\n00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.040\nWe look forward to seeing you in part two\nand the same thing to you, the audience.\n\n605\n00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:41.910\nThank you for being here.\n\n606\n00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:43.280\nSigning out for

00:00:17.085\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:21.166\nwe are continuing through our series\nin CompTIA's Server+ (SK0-004).\n\n7\n00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.485\nWe're actually coming back with\na part 2 in troubleshooting security.\n\n8\n00:00:24.485 --> 00:00:26.895\nAnd joining us in the studios is Mr.\nDon Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:28.120\nDon, how you doing sir?\n\n10\n00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.450\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing swell, Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.618\nReady to dive right back\ninto the world of security.\n\n12\n00:00:31.618 --> 00:00:34.420\nAnd we're gonna kick things off by\n\n13\n00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.750\nwrapping up three different\nareas in one on this one.\n\n14\n00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.030\nSo, as we read down our objectives,\nsome of these areas are very similar.\n\n15\n00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.690\nWe've got,\ncannot access network files and shares.\n\n16\n00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.890\nWe've got, unable to open files.\n\n17\n00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.320\nAnd we've got, excessive access.\n\n18\n00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.070\nAll three of these common problems\ndeal with the same thing, permissions.\n\n19\n00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.760\nWhen somebody accesses files or\n\n20\n00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.600\nresources on the network,\nwe need to have permissions in place.\n\n21\n00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.730\nAnd hopefully, your network is configured\nat the sweet spot where everybody\n\n22\n00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.190\nhas the right privileges for\nthe access that they need, right?\n\n23\n00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.250\nEarlier in the series I talked\nabout the privilege of least, no!\n\n24\n00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.730\nThe principle of least privilege,\nthere we go.\n\n25\n00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.612\nWhere you never wanna give anybody\ntoo much access or too little access.\n\n26\n00:01:14.612 --> 00:01:17.440\nYou wanna give them exactly\nwhat they need to do their job.\n\n27\n00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.130\nIf you give them too little access,\nthey can't read or\n\n28\n00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.860\nwrite to files that they need access to.\n\n29\n00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.630\nThey can't do their job.\n\n30\n00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.296\nIf you give them too much access,\nthey'll have access to files and\n\n31\n00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:28.064\nfolders they shouldn't have,\n\n32\n00:01:28.064 --> 00:01:32.003\nand potentially if it's malicious,\nthey get in and mess with things.\n\n33\n00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:34.858\nBut even accidentally,\nthey could accidentally delete,\n\n34\n00:01:34.858 --> 00:01:38.282\nor modify files that they didn't\nintend to, it just sort of happened,\n\n35\n00:01:38.282 --> 00:01:40.870\nand it's because we gave\nthem too much access.\n\n36\n00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.800\nSo we always wanna make sure that we\ngive people exactly what they need.\n\n37\n00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.260\nWell, if we've misconfigured,\nyou're gonna see errors like, hey,\n\n38\n00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.400\nI'm trying to access this file on\nthe network share, and I can't access it.\n\n39\n00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.360\nOr hey I can't find this file,\nI know I saved it to the network share\n\n40\n00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.740\nyesterday and now it's gone,\nwhat happened?\n\n41\n00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.080\nThey start to see that kinda problem.\n\n42\n00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.980\nAnd that's an indicator that we've\nkind of lost control of our data.\n\n43\n00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.540\nThat we've either given too much or\ntoo little access.\n\n44\n00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.150\nWell, if you go back and\nwatch out networking episode,\n\n45\n00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.600\nwe talk a little bit\nabout permissions there.\n\n46\n00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.320\nBut really, back in A+ and network+ and\nthe Windows server shows and the Red Hat\n\n47\n00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.940\nshows, we talk about file permissions in\nall of those because it is so important.\n\n48\n00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.060\nBut in this show we specifically talk\nabout how there were share permissions and\n\n49\n00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.110\nthere were file permissions.\n\n50\n00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.190\nThere were two different sets of\npermissions and they work together.\n\n51\n00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.970\nAnd because they work together, it means\nthat I can mess one of them up and\n\n52\n00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.420\nit will mess the other one up, right?\n\n53\n00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.110\nThey work together.\n\n54\n00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.230\nYou're screwing both up at the same time.\n\n55\n00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.960\nIt's awesome.\n\n56\n00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.580\nSo when we go to troubleshoot,\n\n57\n00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.300\nyou've got to remember that there's\ntwo different places to look.\n\n58\n00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.669\nSo for example,\nif I take a Windows machine like this one.\n\n59\n00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:48.530\nAnd in part 1,\n\n60\n00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.760\nI had just created a temporary folder\nreal quick to demonstrate a point.\n\n61\n00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.620\nBut if I go and find that folder,\nwhich apparently I've deleted since then.\n\n62\n00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.700\nSo I'll recreate it, that we can took\na look at that folder and its permissions.\n\n63\n00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.370\nSo I'm just gonna pull up\nthe Properties of that folder.\n\n64\n00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.140\nAnd I'm gonna go into Security.\n\n65\n00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.150\nAnd what I'm looking at here on\nthe Security tab are the permissions\n\n66\n00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.080\non this folder itself.\n\n67\n00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.800\nAnd these permissions apply when\nsomebody comes in via the network or\n\n68\n00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.270\nwhen they sit right here in front\nof this machine and use it.\n\n69\n00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.470\nSo these permissions are always going\nto take effect and I might have given\n\n70\n00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.510\nsomebody too many permissions or too\nlittle permissions but I'll see it in here\n\n71\n00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.840\nthat they've either got or\ndon't have the permissions that they need.\n\n72\n00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.450\nWhere it gets tricky though is when\nthey come in over the network,\n\n73\n00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.080\nwe also have Sharing Permissions.\n\n74\n00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.610\nAnd this folder is not shared for\nme because I just created it.\n\n75\n00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.190\nBut, if I do share it,\nI get to pick who has what access.\n\n76\n00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.220\nAnd this works in tandem\nwith the other permissions.\n\n77\n00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.140\nNow remember that when they combine,\n\n78\n00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.180\nthe end user gets the most\nrestrictive permission.\n\n79\n00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.720\nSo on the share,\nI might have full control, access,\n\n80\n00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.320\nthe ability to access everything in there.\n\n81\n00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.470\nBut then, I go back to the file\npermissions and I have read only.\n\n82\n00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.410\nAnd the end result will be,\nI get read only.\n\n83\n00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.550\nFrom a troubleshooting perspective,\nwe have to know to look both places.\n\n84\n00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.080\nBecause an end user might call and\nsay, hey I can't write to that file.\n\n85\n00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.250\nAnd I go and\nlook at the share permissions and\n\n86\n00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.310\nI see where that user has full control.\n\n87\n00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.230\nThey should be able to write.\n\n88\n00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.900\nThey must be doing something wrong.\n\n89\n00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.350\nWell, they're not doing anything wrong,\n\n90\n00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.580\nit's the file permissions\nthat aren't backing them up.\n\n91\n00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.640\nSo we've gotta go and double check that.\n\n92\n00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.340\nThe same thing happens in the UNIX world,\nthat you have file permissions there.\n\n93\n00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.600\nLet me switch over to a Linux server.\n\n94\n00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.350\nSo when I look at a file,\n\n95\n00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.070\nI've got permissions dictated over\nhere based on group,and owner, and\n\n96\n00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.910\neveryone else, and what permission\nthey have access to, right?\n\n97\n00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.280\nSo there's the file permissions.\n\n98\n00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.540\nThese always take effect.\n\n99\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.410\nBut then, I might be sharing\nthese folders out with NFS, and\n\n100\n00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.170\nNFS has its own permissions too.\n\n101\n00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.740\nIf I create an NFS share and\nI flag the whole share as read-only,\n\n102\n00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.690\nit doesn't matter, people have\nread-write all over the place here,\n\n103\n00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.720\nthey're gonna end up with read only\ncuz the NFS share is read only.\n\n104\n00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.565\nSo just know that when you\nshare things on the network,\n\n105\n00:04:55.565 --> 00:04:58.890\nthere maybe two different places\nyou have to check permissions.\n\n106\n00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.150\nAlways double check that.\n\n107\n00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.900\nIf that's not the issue,\nif everything is fine there,\n\n108\n00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.390\ntypically your problem is\ngonna being authentication.\n\n109\n00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.616\nAuthentication is kinda crazy,\n\n110\n00:05:06.616 --> 00:05:09.290\nthis is one of those where we\nstart to tie in other services.\n\n111\n00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.370\nMost systems use some form of Kerberos for\nnetwork authentication these days.\n\n112\n00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.370\nWindows has switched to it.\n\n113\n00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.030\nMost Linux and\nUnix systems have been using it for years.\n\n114\n00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.980\nAnd with Kerberos, Curberas,\nor however you wanna say it.\n\n115\n00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.540\nWhat it does is, it uses\na token-based authentication system.\n\n116\n00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.170\nAnd the token has\na timestamp attached to it.\n\n117\n00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.520\nAnd when you're sending your token back\nand forth to prove you're authenticated,\n\n118\n00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.180\nif that timestamp gets too far off, it\nwill look like somebody's doing a man in\n\n119\n00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.288\nthe middle attack, like a replay attack,\nand systems will reject it.\n\n120\n00:05:40.288 --> 00:05:42.690\nSo most Kerberos-based systems,\n\n121\n00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.160\nlike the Microsoft Active Directory,\nhave a five minute window.\n\n122\n00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.770\nIf your clock is off by\nmore than five minutes,\n\n123\n00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.260\nyou won't be able to authenticate.\n\n124\n00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.910\nSo the permissions might be perfectly\nfine on the network share, but\n\n125\n00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:55.880\nwhen you go to access it,\n\n126\n00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.140\nyour token's expired, looks like a man\nin the middle attack and it stops you.\n\n127\n00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.330\nSo having good clock synchronization\nis importing in making sure people\n\n128\n00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.580\ncan authenticate in the Unix world\nas well as in the Windows world.\n\n129\n00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.090\nOkay, a couple other things\nto dive in on this one.\n\n130\n00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.130\nBeyond that, we do have enhanced\nsecurity layers that kick in,\n\n131\n00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.720\nthat let you manipulate how programs work.\n\n132\n00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.880\nAnd on a server, these are really,\nreally important.\n\n133\n00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.600\nOkay, I talked a little bit about\nprivilege escalation in the last episode.\n\n134\n00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.170\nWhen a hacker targets a server, so\n\n135\n00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.940\nif they've targeted a web\nserver that I've got.\n\n136\n00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.830\nThe web server's running Apache.\n\n137\n00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.930\nThey can talk to Apache.\n\n138\n00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.650\nAnd Apache is doing things on\nthe back end as the Apache server,\n\n139\n00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.330\nat least it normally is.\n\n140\n00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.910\nIf an attacker can break into it,\nand somehow assume the role of\n\n141\n00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.450\nthe root user of the server,now they can\nstart performing commands as the system,\n\n142\n00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.720\nand get elevated privileges and\ndo whatever they want with that server.\n\n143\n00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.070\nInstall software, transfer data,\ndo whatever they want.\n\n144\n00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.010\nUsually use it as a springboard\nto then access backend systems\n\n145\n00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.640\nthey wouldn't normally have access to.\n\n146\n00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.570\nAll sorts of bad things.\n\n147\n00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.840\nWell, that type of privilege\nescalation is a problem.\n\n148\n00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.840\nAnd we need to make\nsure it doesn't happen.\n\n149\n00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.070\nWe've already got permissions in place so\nthat it shouldn't happen.\n\n150\n00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.440\nBut they exploited some\nvulnerability in the system and so\n\n151\n00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.280\nthey were able to get\naround those limitations.\n\n152\n00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.610\nSo there's security sub layers behind\nthe scenes that work to prevent that.\n\n153\n00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:25.360\nThat work to, kind of, mitigate, or\nat least, contain the compromise.\n\n154\n00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.003\nAnd, there's no better example of\nthat than a utility called chroot.\n\n155\n00:07:29.003 --> 00:07:34.175\nchroot is the change root utility and\nwhat you can do is when you run a program,\n\n156\n00:07:34.175 --> 00:07:37.025\nnormally the program sees\nyour entire hard drive.\n\n157\n00:07:37.025 --> 00:07:39.945\nAnd you can create rules that say yeah,\nyou're allowed to write to this folder or\n\n158\n00:07:39.945 --> 00:07:42.425\nwrite to that folder but you're not\nallowed to write to these other folders.\n\n159\n00:07:42.425 --> 00:07:45.600\nBut if they can get root access,\nthey can overcome that, can't they?\n\n160\n00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.243\nYou can't look a root user out.\n\n161\n00:07:47.243 --> 00:07:51.093\nSo with chroot, what it does is it\nsays when you run that program,\n\n162\n00:07:51.093 --> 00:07:53.484\nit doesn't see the hard drive any more.\n\n163\n00:07:53.484 --> 00:07:57.034\nIt sees a particular folder as the root.\n\n164\n00:07:57.034 --> 00:08:00.889\nAnd no matter what level of permission you\nare, if you're the root user or full blown\n\n165\n00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:05.170\nadministrator or if you're a regular user,\nyou only see what's in that one folder.\n\n166\n00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.350\nSo they might be able\nto compromise Apache.\n\n167\n00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.150\nAnd get at all of the Apache stuff.\n\n168\n00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.680\nBut they won't be able to get\nat the rest of the server.\n\n169\n00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.690\nThey won't be able to use\nit to springboard to other\n\n170\n00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.220\nsystems inside of the network.\n\n171\n00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.830\nThey're contained, right?\n\n172\n00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.820\nYou hear people call it chroot,\nsome people call it a jail.\n\n173\n00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.710\nI think the original versions of\nit were actually called a jail.\n\n174\n00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.200\nIt was developed in the BSD world and\nin Solaris.\n\n175\n00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.340\nSolaris is BSD anyway.\n\n176\n00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.130\nSo it came from that stuff\nbefore jumping into Linux.\n\n177\n00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.310\nAnd even making the jump\nover into Windows.\n\n178\n00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.630\nAlthough, it's far less obvious\nin Windows the way that it works.\n\n179\n00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.410\nThose systems are pretty straightforward.\n\n180\n00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:40.270\nNot every application supports it.\n\n181\n00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.220\nBecause some applications really\nbreak when you give them a fake root.\n\n182\n00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.920\nThey expect to see a root directory.\n\n183\n00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.150\nThink about what's off of the root.\n\n184\n00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.580\nOn a Linux server, if I,\nlet me just pull up my root directory.\n\n185\n00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.780\nIf you look at what all's in the root\ndirectory, you've got things like /lib,\n\n186\n00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.550\nthat's kind of important\nbecause a lot of the libraries,\n\n187\n00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.200\nthe linked libraries are in there.\n\n188\n00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.690\nSo I'm running a program and\nit might depend on those libraries.\n\n189\n00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:06.560\nIf I change it's root to be my home\nfolder, It's not gonna see /lib any more.\n\n190\n00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.730\nIt just lost access to\nall of its libraries.\n\n191\n00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:09.830\nThat would be bad.\n\n192\n00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.700\nSo when you do things\nlike changing the route,\n\n193\n00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.820\nyou need to dictate exactly\nwhat folders it can get to.\n\n194\n00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.540\nAnd that starts to cause a lot\nof compatibility problems.\n\n195\n00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:21.530\nSo a nice little mix in\nbetween the two is a package\n\n196\n00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.630\nof policy software called SE Linux.\n\n197\n00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.270\nSo Security Enhanced Linux.\n\n198\n00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.060\nAnd if you wanna learn more about\nit jump over to our Red Hat Show.\n\n199\n00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.900\nWe go into it in depth over there.\n\n200\n00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:34.710\nBut just to show you real quick, what SE\nLinux does it has these defined policies\n\n201\n00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:39.380\nand it says this programs are allowed to\naccess a certain folders and that's it.\n\n202\n00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.850\nAnd no matter what the program is\nnot allowed to access other folders,\n\n203\n00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.960\neven if they're root,\nit's going to restrict them.\n\n204\n00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.910\nSo it's kind of like chroot, except it\ngives you access to individual components.\n\n205\n00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.940\nThat means that it's harder to configure,\nbut it's actually not that bad.\n\n206\n00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.980\nThere's a few utilities that make it\na little bit easier to deal with.\n\n207\n00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.620\nSo let me just give you\nan example with Apache, right?\n\n208\n00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.550\nApache is the most common\nLinux web server and\n\n209\n00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.102\nI am pretty sure I am running it on here.\n\n210\n00:10:04.102 --> 00:10:07.773\nSo let me just do a systemctl status for\nhttpd,\n\n211\n00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:12.790\nand sure enough,\nI can see that I'm running Apache.\n\n212\n00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.340\nAnd it's up and running right now.\n\n213\n00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.310\nSo it's up, it's running, it's happy.\n\n214\n00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:21.880\nAnd when Apache is running,\nwhere is it getting its files?\n\n215\n00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.675\nWell if we look\n\n216\n00:10:23.675 --> 00:10:32.360\n/etc/httpd/httpd.com we can\nsee it's configuration.\n\n217\n00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:38.120\nWhoops, or we can try to,\napparently, you know what?\n\n218\n00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.310\nI need to sudo.\n\n219\n00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:46.275\nAnd I need to spell it right is\ngonna be my other challenge here.\n\n220\n00:10:46.275 --> 00:10:50.210\n[LAUGH] So it doesn't help you\nwith the spelling side of things.\n\n221\n00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:54.260\nBut, actually I'm forgetting\na subdirectory too, so\n\n222\n00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.290\nif I get that right, there we go.\n\n223\n00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:58.775\nI can look into the configuration file for\nApache.\n\n224\n00:10:58.775 --> 00:11:01.735\nAnd when I go inside of it what\nyou're gonna find is where it\n\n225\n00:11:01.735 --> 00:11:05.115\ndefines the directories\nthat it stores stuff in.\n\n226\n00:11:05.115 --> 00:11:10.205\nAnd so as I go down the configuration file\neventually I will find the document root\n\n227\n00:11:10.205 --> 00:11:12.987\nright here, /var/www, right?\n\n228\n00:11:12.987 --> 00:11:16.105\nAnd right here, /var/www/html.\n\n229\n00:11:16.105 --> 00:11:19.815\nThat's where it actually\nexpects to store my web pages.\n\n230\n00:11:19.815 --> 00:11:21.470\nSo my web pages go here.\n\n231\n00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:25.730\nBut there's other content inside\nthe /var/www, like the cgi directory,\n\n232\n00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.990\nwhere it has the cgi scripts.\n\n233\n00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.030\nThat's actually here,\nnot inside of the html folder.\n\n234\n00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.060\nSo, it has different folders\nwith different needs.\n\n235\n00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.920\nWith SE Linux, they have a policy for\nhttpd, for Apache, that says yes,\n\n236\n00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.420\nApache can access this.\n\n237\n00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:46.530\nApache can access /var/www/html and if I\nwant, I can even give it write access.\n\n238\n00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.406\nBut Apache can access /var/www but\nnot have write access,\n\n239\n00:11:50.406 --> 00:11:53.607\nit's not allowed to write\nto that no matter what.\n\n240\n00:11:53.607 --> 00:11:56.450\nEven if I configure it it's not allowed,\nbecause that's the policy.\n\n241\n00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.860\nRight, the policy that's put in place.\n\n242\n00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.085\nThis is better that chroot because I can\ngive it access to different directories\n\n243\n00:12:02.085 --> 00:12:07.085\nand lay it out that way and it's still\nrestrictive like chroot would be.\n\n244\n00:12:07.085 --> 00:12:08.923\nSo, it's a great alternative.\n\n245\n00:12:08.923 --> 00:12:12.655\nWhere it gets to be a challenge\nthough is let's say that I\n\n246\n00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:19.470\nhave something like an external array or\na SAN.\n\n247\n00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:23.800\nI have a SAN, it's got a RAID10 array and\nthat's where I want my web server to be.\n\n248\n00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.220\nAnd so, I create a line on the SAN and\n\n249\n00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.900\nI assign it to this server and\nI format it and I mount it into /website.\n\n250\n00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:36.940\nSo now I've got a folder,\nThat is in the root, right, /website.\n\n251\n00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.260\nAnd that folder is not something that,\n\n252\n00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.510\nlet me just bump my privileges up so\nI can stop sudoing everything.\n\n253\n00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:49.050\nSo if I go into /website,\nthere we go, so I'm in /website.\n\n254\n00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.720\nThat folder, I can put my website there,\nand that would be great.\n\n255\n00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.570\nBut httpd or Apache doesn't have\naccess to that folder by default.\n\n256\n00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.990\nIf it tries to access that folder,\nSE Linux blocks it.\n\n257\n00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.360\nIt stops it from accessing.\n\n258\n00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.530\nThat's good, that's what we want, right?\n\n259\n00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:04.800\nBut now it doesn't work.\n\n260\n00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.560\nAnd so what happens?\n\n261\n00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.890\nWell, if you go out on the Internet and\nGoogle and do a search and\n\n262\n00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.060\nsay, SE Linux blocks access, what do I do?\n\n263\n00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.930\nThe first page where you get ten results,\nI can guarantee you nine out of those ten\n\n264\n00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.560\nwill have instructions on\nhow to turn SE Linux off.\n\n265\n00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.810\nAnd it frustrates the heck out of me, it\ndrives me nuts, cuz that's not the point.\n\n266\n00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:27.910\nIf the door handle on my front door is\ngiving me a problem locking it I go and\n\n267\n00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.860\nget some WMD40 and I spray it in the lock\nso it works, I don't just say all right,\n\n268\n00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.380\nI just won't lock it anymore.\n\n269\n00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.730\nThat works,\nthat's not what we want, right?\n\n270\n00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.880\nYou don't want to just ignore\nthe security sub-system.\n\n271\n00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.490\nYou need to make it work,\nyou need to troubleshoot the problem.\n\n272\n00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.150\nThe problem here is that httpd is trying\n\n273\n00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.050\nto access a folder that\nit's not allowed to access.\n\n274\n00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:46.300\nSo what should I do?\n\n275\n00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.730\nI should give it access,\ngive it access to that folder.\n\n276\n00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.450\nThat's where it gets challenging cuz\nsomebody has to learn something new.\n\n277\n00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.490\nI have to learn something new?\n\n278\n00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.820\nLet me just learn how to turn that off.\n\n279\n00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.350\nThere we go.\nOne command.\n\n280\n00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.670\nBut it's even better if we can fix it.\n\n281\n00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:01.390\nIf we can fix it now things will work.\n\n282\n00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.750\nSo what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna first off go ahead and\n\n283\n00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.950\ntell, here let me create\na index.html file.\n\n284\n00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:08.450\nThere we go.\n\n285\n00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.670\nSo once I've got that now I can tell\nApache that I want to start using this\n\n286\n00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:14.170\nfolder, right?\n\n287\n00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:18.000\nThis is where I want to store my\nwebsite and it's got an index in it and\n\n288\n00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.120\neverything's gonna be great.\n\n289\n00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.400\nSo, I'm gonna edit the configuration file.\n\n290\n00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.400\nAnd I'm gonna go in here and\nfind that document root.\n\n291\n00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.150\nThe document root that was\npointing to /var/www/html.\n\n292\n00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.390\nAnd I'm going to override that.\n\n293\n00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.940\nAnd, I'm gonna say, you know what,\ninstead of having my documents there,\n\n294\n00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.690\nI'm gonna have my documents in /website.\n\n295\n00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.920\nThat's where they're gonna be, okay?\n\n296\n00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.550\nI'm still gonna maintain the /var/www\nbecause that's where the cgi scripts and\n\n297\n00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.010\nother things will be, that's fine.\n\n298\n00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.600\nBut /website, that's where I\nwant my default website to be.\n\n299\n00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.310\nI might create a vHost and put it there.\n\n300\n00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.110\nYou've got a few different options.\n\n301\n00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:58.200\nI do need to update it down\nhere in the directory also.\n\n302\n00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.700\nSo let me fix that, and we'll be set.\n\n303\n00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:10.000\nOkay, so\nnow that's in place I can restart httpd.\n\n304\n00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.290\nSo I'll go ahead and restart that.\n\n305\n00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:17.400\nSystemctl, I've got service on the mind.\n\n306\n00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:17.900\nThere we go.\n\n307\n00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.560\nSo I can restart it.\n\n308\n00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.030\nAnd it's gonna restart, and odds\nare the service will restart just fine.\n\n309\n00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.460\nIt's gonna start up and be happy.\n\n310\n00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:31.900\nIf I do a systemctl status of httpd,\nthere it is, active, running.\n\n311\n00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.440\nOkay, it's happy.\n\n312\n00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.790\nBecause it hasn't really tried\nto access that folder yet.\n\n313\n00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:40.780\nIt's not gonna try and access that folder\nuntil I come in and try and browse to it.\n\n314\n00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.101\nIf the user tries to browse to that,\nthey'll get an error.\n\n315\n00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:46.911\nSo if I come in here and try and fire\nup Firefox, well when I point to that,\n\n316\n00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:48.985\nI created an index file which is empty.\n\n317\n00:15:48.985 --> 00:15:52.105\nSo what I should see is\na completely blank web page.\n\n318\n00:15:52.105 --> 00:15:53.544\nI should get a white page.\n\n319\n00:15:53.544 --> 00:15:55.607\nRight, but when I browse and I get this,\n\n320\n00:15:55.607 --> 00:15:58.870\nI get the Red Hat Enterprise Linux\ntest page.\n\n321\n00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.640\nWhy am I getting that?\n\n322\n00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.890\nWell in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, when\nyou get a directory permission failure,\n\n323\n00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:08.420\nit just defaults to showing the test page.\n\n324\n00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.806\nI should be seeing a white page right now,\nan empty page.\n\n325\n00:16:10.806 --> 00:16:14.130\nBut instead I'm getting\nthe test page because Apache\n\n326\n00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:18.350\ndidn't have permission to access\nthe folder where I pointed it to.\n\n327\n00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.020\nAnd if I go and look at my system logs,\nI should find where that got blocked.\n\n328\n00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.650\nWhere SC Linux blocked that\nfrom being able to access it.\n\n329\n00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.428\nIn fact, we should just be able to go\nin there and look at that right now.\n\n330\n00:16:28.428 --> 00:16:31.404\nIf I come in here and take a look at,\n\n331\n00:16:31.404 --> 00:16:36.435\nhere let me do a tail of\n/var/log/audit because SELinux\n\n332\n00:16:36.435 --> 00:16:41.890\nis technically auditing file access and\nallowing or denying.\n\n333\n00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:47.729\nSo /var/log/audit.log.\n\n334\n00:16:47.729 --> 00:16:54.560\nAnd, sorry, it's audit is the folder,\nand then audit.log inside of that.\n\n335\n00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.580\nThere we go.\n\n336\n00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.420\nAnd as I look,\nboy that's a jumbled mess, isn't it?\n\n337\n00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.060\nLook at all that stuff.\n\n338\n00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.890\nLet me stretch this a little wider.\n\n339\n00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.080\nBut, what we're gonna see.\n\n340\n00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.970\nYou can kinda see it right here.\n\n341\n00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:09.390\nIs that there's that /website/index.html,\nright?\n\n342\n00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:14.470\nAnd if I look over here,\nthe access was denied, right.\n\n343\n00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:18.360\nFor process ID 7272 which is httpd.\n\n344\n00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.150\nHttpd tried to access it.\n\n345\n00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.525\nAnd when it did,\nit accessed it using its context.\n\n346\n00:17:23.525 --> 00:17:26.600\nIts context is type httpd.\n\n347\n00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.640\nBut that folder had a context of system,\nright.\n\n348\n00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.780\nIt had a context or\nactually unconfined right here.\n\n349\n00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.920\nSo it had the wrong context.\n\n350\n00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.509\nIt's not allowed to access that.\n\n351\n00:17:38.509 --> 00:17:41.770\nSo now it can't do it.\n\n352\n00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.290\nAnd so I give up and\nturn off SC Linux, which works.\n\n353\n00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:46.890\nBut then I lose all that security.\n\n354\n00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:50.410\nNow a hacker can compromise and access my\nwhole hard dive if they wanted, right.\n\n355\n00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:53.340\nSo instead I need to change that policy,\nand\n\n356\n00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.870\nsay it's okay for\nhttpd to access that folder.\n\n357\n00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.370\nAnd we just need to learn our system.\n\n358\n00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.250\nThis is true of anything.\n\n359\n00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.170\nIf I was on Windows, or MAC or whatever.\n\n360\n00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.510\nThey've all got great security procedures.\n\n361\n00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.390\nYou just have to learn them, right?\n\n362\n00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.320\nAnd it's part of\nthe troubleshooting process.\n\n363\n00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.540\nBy looking at a log file, I can see\nwhether that access was denied, and\n\n364\n00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.250\nnow I can go in and I can fix that, right.\n\n365\n00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:19.700\nNow, to help with fixing it, what I like\nto do is a tail -f, of that log file.\n\n366\n00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.570\nIf I run that, that's follow.\n\n367\n00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:24.830\nThat means it's gonna continually display\nthe last 10 entries in that log file but\n\n368\n00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:29.980\nI'm also gonna filter it, so\nI'm gonna a little grep of httpd.\n\n369\n00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.880\nOkay, I always see lines that\nreference httpd, I might be getting\n\n370\n00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.890\nother errors on the system and\nit makes it hard to work at the log files.\n\n371\n00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:40.280\nSo this command is gonna make it follow,\nshow me the last ten lines but\n\n372\n00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.170\nonly show me the lines\nthat deal with httpd.\n\n373\n00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.590\nAnd the cool part about this,\nis now that that's running.\n\n374\n00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:52.060\nIf I go and do stuff, right, if I go and\nlike try and browse to the site again,\n\n375\n00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.590\nit generates an error and I don't know if\nyou saw it scroll by really fast there but\n\n376\n00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:57.150\nnow it added more entries.\n\n377\n00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.800\nSo it added more and\nit's gonna continually scroll.\n\n378\n00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.150\nSo I should be able to get in here and fix\nthe problem and then be in business, okay.\n\n379\n00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:07.070\nNow just like I piped that\ninto the GREP command,\n\n380\n00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.120\nI can pipe it into another command too.\n\n381\n00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.480\nTo get the setup right, I need to show\nthe system the access that I want.\n\n382\n00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.380\nAnd I can go and\nmodify all the policies and all that.\n\n383\n00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.820\nBut the system can automatically\ndetect a lot of this stuff.\n\n384\n00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.260\nLet me fire up in a new tab.\n\n385\n00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.880\nHere and what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna change my enforcement level.\n\n386\n00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.080\nLet me elevate my privileges real quick,\nbecause you do need to be root to do this.\n\n387\n00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:36.560\nThe getenforce command shows me that\nSELinux is currently enforcing.\n\n388\n00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.730\nI'm gonna say setenforce 0, all right?\n\n389\n00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.280\nAnd what that's gonna do,\nit's gonna change it into permissive mode.\n\n390\n00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:47.660\nIn permissive mode it allows people to do\nthings they shouldn't be, but it logs it.\n\n391\n00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.570\nSo I get a log of that\ninappropriate access.\n\n392\n00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:52.680\nSo now I'm able to track what's\nhappening on the system.\n\n393\n00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:59.710\nAnd from here I can come in and\nI'm gonna look for\n\n394\n00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:07.340\nhttpd lines in /var/log/audit/audit.log.\n\n395\n00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.770\nRight, so I'm looking for\nthose errors, and\n\n396\n00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:15.210\nI'm gonna send those errors to a little\nutility called audit2allow, right.\n\n397\n00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.240\nAudit2allow will look for\nerrors in the log, for\n\n398\n00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.160\naccess, and\nadd them to the policy to allow them.\n\n399\n00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.420\nRight, so I can turn on the service.\n\n400\n00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.010\nI can do the action that\nI'm trying to allow and\n\n401\n00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:33.320\nit'll figure all the permissions for me\nand add them to the policy like I expect.\n\n402\n00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.410\nSo I'm gonna tell it to monitor for httpd.\n\n403\n00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:39.910\nI'm only sending it httpd lines anyway,\nso that should be fine.\n\n404\n00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:43.310\nAnd then I'm gonna tell it that I need\nto write that to a policy file, so\n\n405\n00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:44.960\nI'll be able to load it on the system.\n\n406\n00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:50.210\nOkay, so that one is gonna run and\nits throwing up the errors that it found.\n\n407\n00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:54.630\nSo here is these access denied here, it's\nkinda popping up that it's finding, right?\n\n408\n00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:58.880\nSo it just did that, it found them and\nit's showing what happened.\n\n409\n00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.940\nHere I was missing an allow rule.\n\n410\n00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.180\nI was missing a different allow rule.\n\n411\n00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.280\nEach one of these is why\nthe error was generated.\n\n412\n00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:11.570\nAnd it's gonna dump that to a file so\nthat I can pull it out,\n\n413\n00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.000\nand actually, I didn't tell it\nto dump it to a file, did it?\n\n414\n00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.970\nI probably don't wanna\ndo that here anyway.\n\n415\n00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:18.230\nI'm in the website folder, so\nif I dump into a file here,\n\n416\n00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.840\nit's kind of in a bad spot, so\nlet me change my home directory.\n\n417\n00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:27.670\nAnd I'm gonna rerun that with a -M, there.\n\n418\n00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:28.620\nThere we go.\nAnd\n\n419\n00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.920\nit's going to generate a little module for\nme.\n\n420\n00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.514\nThat module's is this httpd.pp file.\n\n421\n00:21:34.514 --> 00:21:38.010\nOkay, that's the SELinux\npolicy file that I need.\n\n422\n00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:41.915\nAnd I can take that and\nI can load that in to the system.\n\n423\n00:21:41.915 --> 00:21:46.821\nSo I'm gonna import httpd.pp.\n\n424\n00:21:46.821 --> 00:21:49.225\nSo I'm importing that into SELinux, so\n\n425\n00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:52.767\nit now knows these new rules\nthat I wanna have in the system.\n\n426\n00:21:52.767 --> 00:21:55.340\nIt takes just a moment.\n\n427\n00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:00.280\nAnd once that's loaded,\nI can switch my enforcement back to 1.\n\n428\n00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.650\nSo now I'm back to enforcing my policies.\n\n429\n00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:12.430\nAnd if I restart, If I restart Apache,\nwhatever that program is called.\n\n430\n00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:16.910\nThere we go, now it will be\nallowed to access that folder.\n\n431\n00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:20.820\nCuz I performed the action, generated the\nerrors, now it knows what to look for, and\n\n432\n00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:27.160\nto allow it, and now when I go back here,\nwhat should happen is I get I get that.\n\n433\n00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:27.920\nI don't have permission.\n\n434\n00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.370\nI have the file permission set wrong.\n\n435\n00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.490\nBut I don't get the test\npage anymore because Apache\n\n436\n00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.180\nis allowed to access that folder.\n\n437\n00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:38.940\nBut I've got different permission problems\nhere because if I look at /website and I\n\n438\n00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.650\nlook at the folders that are in there and\nthe files, see how they're owned by root?\n\n439\n00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:45.350\nAnd what if I'm not root?\n\n440\n00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:46.720\nWell, root gets read and write.\n\n441\n00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.320\nActually, everybody else gets read so\nwe should have access there.\n\n442\n00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.560\nBut I really should change\nthese to be owned by Apache.\n\n443\n00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.420\nSet the group to Apache,\nthe owner to Apache and\n\n444\n00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:56.560\nthen that way it'll be able to\naccess it and access those files.\n\n445\n00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.200\nBut I'm not getting the test\npage anymore which means Apache\n\n446\n00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.160\nis indeed allowed to access\nthis folder and get to it.\n\n447\n00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.430\nSELinux is setting the boundaries for\nthe application.\n\n448\n00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.290\nAnd now I've removed those boundaries.\n\n449\n00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:12.170\nIf I go back to this screen\nwhere I was tailing errors.\n\n450\n00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:17.031\nHere's my last error that\nI got where I was getting\n\n451\n00:23:17.031 --> 00:23:22.027\nan access denied when it\nwas accessing the folder.\n\n452\n00:23:22.027 --> 00:23:23.194\nAnd now I can come through here and\n\n453\n00:23:23.194 --> 00:23:25.620\nlook and see if I'm getting\nanything new when I browse to it.\n\n454\n00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.205\nI shouldn't be.\n\n455\n00:23:26.205 --> 00:23:27.820\nSELinux should be allowing things.\n\n456\n00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.050\nAnd from there now we can just\nget everything else configured.\n\n457\n00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:32.250\nAnd really straighten\nup our permissions or\n\n458\n00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.370\nwhatever else is it we need to\nget it up and going, right.\n\n459\n00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.110\nUtilities like these are essential for\n\n460\n00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:42.450\ngetting a good security baseline on\nyour server configured in place.\n\n461\n00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:45.110\nAnd if a hacker breaks in and\ncompromises something,\n\n462\n00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.570\nit's gonna stop them from being able\nto access any additional resources.\n\n463\n00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.330\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\na lot of great information.\n\n464\n00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:51.570\nNow, I'm looking at our list and\n\n465\n00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.280\nI know that there's still some\nmore topics you need to cover, but\n\n466\n00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.550\nit does look like we're at least coming\nclose to the end of another episode.\n\n467\n00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.820\nBut before we close this one out,\n\n468\n00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.430\ndo you have additional words you'd\nlike to throw in this episode?\n\n469\n00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:04.190\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, not so much a point,\nbut just a matter of pride.\n\n470\n00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.330\nI'm really quick in the background,\n\n471\n00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:08.180\nfixing the error that I just got cuz\nI hate ending the show on an error.\n\n472\n00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:12.180\nBut if you look at my computer here,\nI changed the owner of that index file to\n\n473\n00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.660\nswitch it over, so it's owned by\nApache like it's supposed to be.\n\n474\n00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.310\nIt expects to have read and\nexecute on those files.\n\n475\n00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:21.380\nSo now that that's said, I should be\nable to jump back over to Firefox.\n\n476\n00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.010\nAnd if I browse to the page, there we go,\n\n477\n00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.880\nnow I get the nice white page\nthat I was expecting to get.\n\n478\n00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.150\nI'm not getting the test page.\n\n479\n00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:29.410\nI'm not getting an error.\n\n480\n00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:33.020\nI'm actually getting index.html\nlike it's intended, right?\n\n481\n00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:37.370\nWe need to leverage our security\npolicies to provide what it is that we\n\n482\n00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:38.690\nneed to do, right?\n\n483\n00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:39.970\nNow, I've got this nice restriction.\n\n484\n00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:43.424\nAnd, if a hacker breaks\nin to my APACHE service,\n\n485\n00:24:43.424 --> 00:24:46.981\nyes they can mess around\nwith /var/www/html.\n\n486\n00:24:46.981 --> 00:24:49.690\nAnd yes they can mess\naround with /website.\n\n487\n00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:55.400\nBut they can't mess around with /etc or\n/var/log, they can't get into those areas.\n\n488\n00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.475\nThey are completely isolated.\n\n489\n00:24:57.475 --> 00:25:00.840\nSELinux will not allow the Apache\nprocess to access those resources.\n\n490\n00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.390\nThat's what it does.\n\n491\n00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:03.570\nIt can get in the way.\n\n492\n00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:04.770\nIt can cause problems.\n\n493\n00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:06.760\nIt can annoy the heck out of you.\n\n494\n00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.770\nBut if you configure it right,\nit can save your butt, and\n\n495\n00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.150\nit can save you having\na data leak out there and\n\n496\n00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:14.430\nhaving to report to all your\ncustomers that you got compromised.\n\n497\n00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.072\nSo really important to take your time.\n\n498\n00:25:16.072 --> 00:25:17.958\nTroubleshoot it,\nrun through the logs, right?\n\n499\n00:25:17.958 --> 00:25:21.980\n/var/logs/audit/auto.log for that one.\n\n500\n00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.840\nIn the Windows world,\n\n501\n00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.600\nyou have protected file access and\nSystems Integrity Protection and\n\n502\n00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.600\nall that work doing the same basic\nthing in preventing that access.\n\n503\n00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.550\nYou could check and make sure\nthat everything is unmodified and\n\n504\n00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.740\nstored the way that it's supposed to.\n\n505\n00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.910\nThese things are really important to\nstop you from having a compromise\n\n506\n00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.290\nserver on the network.\n\n507\n00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.040\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, great episode today.\n\n508\n00:25:41.040 -->

00:00:08.191\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:11.881\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:15.210\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.600\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.493\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\nthrough our series in CompTIA Server+.\n\n8\n00:00:20.493 --> 00:00:22.725\nThat's right, SK0-004.\n\n9\n00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:24.567\nAnd joining us back in the studios for\n\n10\n00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:27.750\na part three on troubleshooting\nsecurity is mister Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.900\nDon, how you doing, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.729\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing swell, Wes,\nready to wrap up security.\n\n13\n00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.760\nAnd really wrap up the whole\ntroubleshooting section.\n\n14\n00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.910\nI had a few things in the security topic\nI didn't get to in the last episode, so\n\n15\n00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.160\nwe're gonna tackle those right here.\n\n16\n00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.690\nNow we did talk about most of the common\nproblems that were out there.\n\n17\n00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.885\nThe only other common problem they\nlisted was excessive memory utilization.\n\n18\n00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:47.650\nAnd excessive memory utilization is where\n\n19\n00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.420\none application starts\nconsuming way too much RAM.\n\n20\n00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.458\nI know we talked about this\nin the software episodes and\n\n21\n00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:53.490\nthe application troubleshooting.\n\n22\n00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.030\nBut we mention it here from security.\n\n23\n00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.615\nNow why is it here in security?\n\n24\n00:00:57.615 --> 00:01:01.385\nWell, typically where you see\nexcessive memory utilization\n\n25\n00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:03.905\nis when people are doing\nbuffer overflow attacks.\n\n26\n00:01:03.905 --> 00:01:05.815\nA buffer overflow attack\nis where you try and\n\n27\n00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:08.705\nwrite more into RAM\nthan you have room for.\n\n28\n00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:12.247\nAnd the goal, what you're hoping for,\nis that you fill up\n\n29\n00:01:12.247 --> 00:01:17.027\nthe spots that you have access to and the\noverflow jumps into other applications.\n\n30\n00:01:17.027 --> 00:01:20.667\nAnd you're hoping that those other\napplications have administrative\n\n31\n00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:21.737\nprivileges that you don't.\n\n32\n00:01:21.737 --> 00:01:24.197\nSo that you can get privilege escalation,\nthat's the goal.\n\n33\n00:01:24.197 --> 00:01:27.887\nBut when somebody's doing a discovery for\nthat, how do they figure that out?\n\n34\n00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:30.770\nIt's hard, it's trial and\nerror, so they try a bunch.\n\n35\n00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.010\nThey keep dumping a bunch of data, and\nit causes large memory consumption, right?\n\n36\n00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.050\nSo that's typically what we see.\n\n37\n00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.980\nThere are some other scenarios where you\nsee large memory consumption related to\n\n38\n00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.310\na security standpoint.\n\n39\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.260\nBut even a simple memory leak\nover time will build up,\n\n40\n00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.747\nyour server runs out of RAM, and\nit stops providing services.\n\n41\n00:01:47.747 --> 00:01:50.787\nYour service goes offline,\nand that is a security issue.\n\n42\n00:01:50.787 --> 00:01:52.933\n&gt;&gt; Don,\nmaybe you can't tell right away, but\n\n43\n00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:56.241\nhow can you tell the difference\nbetween maybe a bug in an application\n\n44\n00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:59.897\nthat's consuming all that memory\nversus a legitimate attack like you've\n\n45\n00:01:59.897 --> 00:02:03.660\nexplained here where somebody's\ntrying to exploit the system?\n\n46\n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.802\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, it's difficult\nbecause normally you might think, well,\n\n47\n00:02:06.802 --> 00:02:09.751\nall right, if it's a memory leak,\nit probably takes a long time to happen\n\n48\n00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:12.205\nversus a hacker where it's\ngonna happen very fast, right?\n\n49\n00:02:12.205 --> 00:02:14.530\nThey try and consume it very quickly,\nbut that's not always true.\n\n50\n00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.095\nThere are dedicated hackers out there\nwhere they just take their time, right?\n\n51\n00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:19.034\nIt's all scripted, anyway,\nwhat do they care, they go to sleep.\n\n52\n00:02:19.034 --> 00:02:22.170\nAnd so it might take weeks or\neven months to happen.\n\n53\n00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.010\nOr it's just not very obvious.\n\n54\n00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.480\nIt could be an application memory leak\nthat just happens to be very fast, so\n\n55\n00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.650\nyou confuse the two.\n\n56\n00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.830\nSo the best way to interpret\nit is to find out whether or\n\n57\n00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.064\nnot there's inappropriate\nnetwork access going on.\n\n58\n00:02:34.064 --> 00:02:37.094\nIf there's inappropriate network access\ngoing on in conjunction with this memory\n\n59\n00:02:37.094 --> 00:02:39.040\nleak, then you know there's a problem.\n\n60\n00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.664\nOkay, now how do we see\ninappropriate network access?\n\n61\n00:02:41.664 --> 00:02:45.390\nWell, typically, we're gonna use\nsomething like a network sniffer.\n\n62\n00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.230\nA sniffer lets you look at the network and\nsee what's going on.\n\n63\n00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.120\nAnd so I can spot whether there's\ninappropriate traffic or access going on.\n\n64\n00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.460\nIf you have servers that are plugged\ninto enterprise-grade switches,\n\n65\n00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.240\nthose switches will support what's\ncalled port mirroring, right?\n\n66\n00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.320\nSome vendors have different names,\n\n67\n00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.310\nlike Cisco calls it SPAN,\nthe switch port analyzer.\n\n68\n00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.960\nBut at the end of the day,\nit's port mirroring.\n\n69\n00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.850\nTraffic on one port gets\nmirrored to another port.\n\n70\n00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.240\nAnd you can take your laptop or\nwhatever, and plug into that other port.\n\n71\n00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.140\nAnd start to listen to the traffic\nthat's happening on that port.\n\n72\n00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.890\nSo you can hear what all's\nbeing sent to the server.\n\n73\n00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.290\nAnd you can look for\nthat network activity and what's going on.\n\n74\n00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.000\nSo for example, on my laptop,\nlet's see, I've got WireShark.\n\n75\n00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.186\nSo this is WireShark,\nWireShark runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac.\n\n76\n00:03:29.186 --> 00:03:30.950\nYou can run it on darn near anything.\n\n77\n00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.950\nAnd you can fire it up, and you can\nstart to capture a network adapter.\n\n78\n00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.621\nAnd so I've got my WiFi adapter, or\n\n79\n00:03:36.621 --> 00:03:38.918\na couple of other adapters\nthat are on my system.\n\n80\n00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:41.120\nLet's see,\nwho's generating some good traffic here?\n\n81\n00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.920\nThis Thunderbolt adapter\nis dead in the water.\n\n82\n00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.130\nThis one is moving a little bit of data.\n\n83\n00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.520\nSo I can pick one of these, and\nI'll take the wireless, what the heck.\n\n84\n00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.970\nSo I'll take my wireless adapter, and\nhere it goes, capturing wireless traffic.\n\n85\n00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.210\nSo this is data that's crossing my network\nand people that are communicating, right?\n\n86\n00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.693\nIPs talking to other IPs.\n\n87\n00:03:59.693 --> 00:04:03.310\nAnd I'm seeing a lot of multicasting and\nbroadcasts cuz that's what you'd expect.\n\n88\n00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.710\nBut when you see this traffic,\nyou can then look at what it is.\n\n89\n00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.830\nWhat type of traffic is that?\n\n90\n00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.590\nAnd you can start to break that down and\ninterpret whether or\n\n91\n00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.150\nnot there's inappropriate access going on.\n\n92\n00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.880\nIf you're seeing a huge amount of traffic\ncoming from one host or something.\n\n93\n00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.940\nThe problem is you get so\n\n94\n00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.540\nmuch data with software like this\nthat it's hard to interpret.\n\n95\n00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.160\nAnd that's where software like\nWireShark really can excel is up top,\n\n96\n00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.570\nI've got this Statistics menu.\n\n97\n00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.927\nAnd you can get it to really\nsummarize things down and\n\n98\n00:04:30.927 --> 00:04:33.143\nget it to show you Conversations.\n\n99\n00:04:33.143 --> 00:04:36.092\nAnd with Conversations,\nnow we can jump in and\n\n100\n00:04:36.092 --> 00:04:39.880\nsort it by who's sending the most\npackets or the most data.\n\n101\n00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.186\nA hacker who's worth their salt will\nsend a large amount of packets, but\n\n102\n00:04:44.186 --> 00:04:46.050\na small amount of data.\n\n103\n00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.546\nOur inclination is hey,\nI'm gonna go in here, sort by bytes.\n\n104\n00:04:48.546 --> 00:04:49.866\nIf somebody's trying to\nbreak into my system,\n\n105\n00:04:49.866 --> 00:04:51.370\nthey're probably sending a ton of bytes.\n\n106\n00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.290\nWell, they're probably not,\nthey're sending little commands.\n\n107\n00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.970\nHow much space do you\nneed to send a command?\n\n108\n00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:56.470\nNot much.\n\n109\n00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.320\nSo it's not so much the bytes,\nbut the packets.\n\n110\n00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.020\nThey might have to send a lot\nof packets to do something.\n\n111\n00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.490\nBut not necessarily a lot of bytes.\n\n112\n00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.500\nAnd so you can jump in here and pull the\nIP communications, sort it out by packets,\n\n113\n00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.640\nand get an idea of who\nyour biggest talker is.\n\n114\n00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.149\nI can see that my laptop,\nfor example, 10.0.10.133,\n\n115\n00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:19.875\nis communicating with 224.0.1.129 a lot.\n\n116\n00:05:19.875 --> 00:05:24.120\nWell, 224 is a multi-cast, so\nit's some kind of multicast communication.\n\n117\n00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.380\nProbably the Apple discovery,\nApple chats a lot.\n\n118\n00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.320\nSo that one may be okay, and\nI just start moving down the list.\n\n119\n00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.890\nHere's other people that\nare chatting to that same one.\n\n120\n00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.050\nAnd then I get down to something\nthat's not a multicast.\n\n121\n00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.200\nWhich, apparently, I'm gonna have to\ngo pretty far down the list here.\n\n122\n00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.150\nThese are all multicast or\nbroadcast communications.\n\n123\n00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.645\nWhen you run a sniffer, you will see\na lot of multicast and broadcast.\n\n124\n00:05:43.645 --> 00:05:45.269\nCuz you see that from the whole network.\n\n125\n00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:49.448\nYou're only gonna see unicasts that are\neither destined for you or coming for you.\n\n126\n00:05:49.448 --> 00:05:52.290\nAnd if you're doing a port mirror,\nit's unicast destined for\n\n127\n00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.770\nwhoever you're mirroring.\n\n128\n00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.090\nSo you're not going to\nsee as many of those.\n\n129\n00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.740\nSo you might have to apply a filter\nto really limit this down.\n\n130\n00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.370\nBut you can start to get\nan idea of who's communicating.\n\n131\n00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.640\nAnd then you can find those packets and\nstart to interpret them.\n\n132\n00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.780\nYou can break them apart and\nstart to look inside to find out\n\n133\n00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.060\nwhat is that actual\ncommunication that's happening.\n\n134\n00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.670\nThat's how we can start to identify\nif it is an attack on our systems.\n\n135\n00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:13.740\nIt's a great way to do it.\n\n136\n00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.910\nThere are people that\nrun these sniffers 24/7,\n\n137\n00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.220\nconstantly capturing network traffic so\nthey can always review it.\n\n138\n00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.311\nOr you can use it as a troubleshooting\ntool where you're reactive.\n\n139\n00:06:21.311 --> 00:06:24.261\nI think there's a problem, so\nlet me fire up the sniffer, and go, and\n\n140\n00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:25.930\nlook at what's out there, all right?\n\n141\n00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.210\nSo definitely a good way to do that.\n\n142\n00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.629\nYou'll notice, as you run a sniffer,\n\n143\n00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:32.210\nthat you'll intercept a lot\nof traffic from a server.\n\n144\n00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.040\nAnd you might see ports\nthat you don't recognize or\n\n145\n00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.660\nthat you didn't know were open.\n\n146\n00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.400\nThat you just you thought\nwere closed ports and for\n\n147\n00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.480\nwhatever reason were left open.\n\n148\n00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.749\nMy goodness, am I seeing a lot of traffic.\n\n149\n00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:45.910\nSo anyhow, you'll see that.\n\n150\n00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.300\nThere's other utilities out there that can\nhelp with that that are maybe a little bit\n\n151\n00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.320\neasier than going in with\na protocol analyzer like this one.\n\n152\n00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.220\nFor example, if I have a new server that\nI set up, I set up a brand new server.\n\n153\n00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.950\nAnd I need to harden the server to stop\npeople from breaking into ports that I\n\n154\n00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.380\ndon't want open.\n\n155\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.050\nI can go through and\nstop services that I don't need, right?\n\n156\n00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.390\nFor example,\nlet me get to a Red Hat machine.\n\n157\n00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.260\nHere's my Red Hat machine that\nI've been using in the show.\n\n158\n00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.661\nAnd if I drop to a terminal,\nand I do a systemctl status,\n\n159\n00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:19.929\nit's going to show me all of my\nservices that I'm running, okay?\n\n160\n00:07:19.929 --> 00:07:22.730\nWell, I'm running just a couple\nof services, aren't I?\n\n161\n00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:28.080\nThat's quite a few, in fact, if I,\nlet me just grep for the word service.\n\n162\n00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.890\nTry and filter that down, here we go.\n\n163\n00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.540\nSo here's the list of the services\nthat I'm running, it's a lot.\n\n164\n00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.630\nAnd some of these I might want,\nsome of these I might not.\n\n165\n00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.292\nAs I look down the list here, I might find\nthings that I'm running that I don't want.\n\n166\n00:07:40.292 --> 00:07:42.540\nHey, I'm running webmin.\n\n167\n00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.509\nWebmin is a web-based server\nadministration suite.\n\n168\n00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:47.381\nIt normally runs on port 10,000.\n\n169\n00:07:47.381 --> 00:07:50.690\nMaybe I don't want that,\nI wanna turn that service off.\n\n170\n00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.361\nWell, actually,\nI don't know if it's on or not.\n\n171\n00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:54.177\nThis is telling me that it's installed,\nright?\n\n172\n00:07:54.177 --> 00:08:01.032\nSo I need to do a systemctl status webmin\nAnd look at it, and it is running.\n\n173\n00:08:01.032 --> 00:08:03.640\nSo, it's up, and it's running.\n\n174\n00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.630\nMaybe I don't want that.\n\n175\n00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:05.660\nI can stop it.\n\n176\n00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.920\nBut if I didn't know to look for\nthat, would I have known.\n\n177\n00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.820\nI could have had services\nrunning that I didn't intend to.\n\n178\n00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.420\nYou have active services, and\ninactive services, right.\n\n179\n00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.340\nActive ones are ones that are running and\ndoing something.\n\n180\n00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.860\nInactive ones are ones\nthat are turned off.\n\n181\n00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.960\nIf it's turned off, nobody can hack it.\n\n182\n00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.900\nIt's turned off, right?\n\n183\n00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.320\nAnd as part of hardening this system,\nI should be turning those off,\n\n184\n00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.080\nanything I'm not going to use.\n\n185\n00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.090\nBut if it's active, I need to secure it.\n\n186\n00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:33.452\nIf it's active and it's not using it, then\nI either need to use a firewall to block\n\n187\n00:08:33.452 --> 00:08:35.869\nit, or, better, just turn it off, right.\n\n188\n00:08:35.869 --> 00:08:40.319\nIf I'm not gonna use Webmin,\nI can just do a system CTL stop,\n\n189\n00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:43.038\nand then stop the webmin.service.\n\n190\n00:08:43.038 --> 00:08:46.149\nAnd then I would need to do a system\nCTL disable webmin.service.\n\n191\n00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:48.933\nOtherwise the next I reboot it's\njust gonna start again, right, so\n\n192\n00:08:48.933 --> 00:08:50.860\nyou need to make sure it\ndoesn't start at boot.\n\n193\n00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.123\nIn Windows you have the services,\nwhere's my Windows machine,\n\n194\n00:08:54.123 --> 00:08:56.268\nI've lost my Windows server, here it is.\n\n195\n00:08:56.268 --> 00:09:01.356\nI can go into services.msc,\nand I can find a service and\n\n196\n00:09:01.356 --> 00:09:04.720\nsee how some of these are automatic?\n\n197\n00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.820\nThose are ones that will start\nup when the system boots, and\n\n198\n00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.920\nthen it's running right now.\n\n199\n00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.840\nI could always stop it, but\nit'll just start when i reboot.\n\n200\n00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.120\nOr I can pull it up and\n\n201\n00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.600\nI can tell it to go manual, where it'll\nonly start if I tell it to start.\n\n202\n00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.290\nOr we can go disabled.\n\n203\n00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.920\nNow what's the difference there.\n\n204\n00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.830\nWhy not just choose disable?\n\n205\n00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.380\nWell, there's some services\nthat depend on other services.\n\n206\n00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.880\nSo up here I've got this dependencies tab,\nand I can see that this service,\n\n207\n00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.190\nthe base filtering engine,\ncannot start unless RPC and\n\n208\n00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:36.710\nthe Microsoft Windows filtering\nprogram are running, right.\n\n209\n00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.790\nSo this service depends on those guys but\n\n210\n00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:43.290\nthese other services down here\nall depend on this service.\n\n211\n00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.380\nSo if put it to disabled the base\nfiltering engine cannot start,\n\n212\n00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:52.040\nwhich means all of these programs\ncannot start like the Windows firewall.\n\n213\n00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.380\nThat's not good.\n\n214\n00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.680\nIf I put this to manual and\nthen the Windows firewall tries to start,\n\n215\n00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.790\nit will start this.\n\n216\n00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.650\nIt'll automatically start it because I\nneeded it for another service to run.\n\n217\n00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.750\nDisabled forces it to not start.\n\n218\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.390\nSo it's a little bit stronger\nof a method of going about it.\n\n219\n00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.340\nBut you need to understand\nhow these services interact.\n\n220\n00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.540\nIn Windows they make it easy.\n\n221\n00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.430\nIn Linux it's a little bit more difficult\nbut when you pull up the status you'll\n\n222\n00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.320\nsee information about\ndependencies in there too.\n\n223\n00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.380\nYou get these little process groups where\nit kind of catalogues all that for you.\n\n224\n00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.450\nSo I just need to make\nsure that I control that.\n\n225\n00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:28.220\nThe other thing is we kind of trust\n\n226\n00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.870\nthese services to do what\nthey say they're doing.\n\n227\n00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.110\nIf I run Apache, I expect it to\nopen port 80 and port 443, but\n\n228\n00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.980\nit could be opening up other ports too.\n\n229\n00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.490\nI need to be aware of that, because if\nthere's other ports that I don't know\n\n230\n00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.420\nabout, I need to block them, right?\n\n231\n00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.590\nAnd so, we can analyze ports\nby using a port scanner,\n\n232\n00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.970\nthere's any number of scanners\nthat are out there you can use.\n\n233\n00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:49.890\nNmap is the most popular one,\nNmap works on Windows, Linux, and Macs, so\n\n234\n00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:50.630\nyou can run it anywhere.\n\n235\n00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.790\nIf you've ever used Nmap,\nit's super easy, at a minimum,\n\n236\n00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:59.700\nyou can just type nmap and then the IP\naddress of the server that you wanna scan.\n\n237\n00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.810\nIf I'm doing this server here local, I can\njust nmap against the loopback address.\n\n238\n00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.970\nSo there goes the scans and\nit shows me these ports.\n\n239\n00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.140\nNow when I look at it, I'm gonna\nsee services that are open and and\n\n240\n00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.580\nthese might be good and\nthey might be bad, right?\n\n241\n00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.170\nSome of these I might not want.\n\n242\n00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.450\nLike IPP,\nI might not be using that, right?\n\n243\n00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.430\nThat's the Internet print protocol.\n\n244\n00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.090\nI'm not using that, so\nI might wanna block it, right?\n\n245\n00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.800\nNFS, I didn't install NFS on this system.\n\n246\n00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.380\nIt must have been installed by default.\n\n247\n00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.780\nI'm not using it, so\nI should probably turn that off.\n\n248\n00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.410\nI can either turn NFS off or\nI can block this port on the firewall.\n\n249\n00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.850\nNow, be careful because when\nyou run Nmap on the localhost,\n\n250\n00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:37.540\nlike I just did,\nyou're seeing it behind the firewall.\n\n251\n00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.745\nSo I might be seeing ports that\nare already been blocked, so\n\n252\n00:11:40.745 --> 00:11:43.450\na better option is to scan\nit from somewhere else.\n\n253\n00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:51.431\nSo for example,\nthis system is 10.0.14.240, right?\n\n254\n00:11:51.431 --> 00:11:54.840\nSo that's my IP, 10.0.14.240.\n\n255\n00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:00.700\nI'm gonna jump over to my Mac and\nI'll run the scan from here instead.\n\n256\n00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:01.260\nRight.\n\n257\n00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.781\nSo I'm gonna do nmap 10.0.14.240 and\n\n258\n00:12:05.781 --> 00:12:11.140\nthe advantage here is I'm gonna scan that\nsystem and I'm gonna hit the firewall, and\n\n259\n00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.080\nso when I hit that firewall, I might find\nthat none of those ports are accessible.\n\n260\n00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.100\nAnd that would mean that the firewall\nis configured very tight.\n\n261\n00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.980\nAnd I'm not so worried about those\nports being open any more, right.\n\n262\n00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.690\nBecause an attacker is gonna\nhave to come from the network.\n\n263\n00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.140\nIf the attacker is already on that server,\nthe firewall doesn't matter, right.\n\n264\n00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.490\nSo we have to make sure we gauge\nthe severity appropriately.\n\n265\n00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.150\nSo this scan,\nthe fact that it's taking so long,\n\n266\n00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:40.010\nis telling me that I'm more than\nlikely as secure as I need to be.\n\n267\n00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.540\nSo do be careful about that though.\n\n268\n00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:45.630\nUnderstand when you run the scan\nfrom the server itself.\n\n269\n00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.660\nYou're kind of behind that\nfirewall already, right?\n\n270\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:53.220\nAnd so that may be why you're seeing\nmore ports open than you would expect.\n\n271\n00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.090\nAnd when you run it remotely,\nyou get a more fair example, right?\n\n272\n00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:02.540\nAnother thing is we could be running\nsomething like anti-malware or intrusion\n\n273\n00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.980\ndetection services on that server where\nyou can look for malicious activity.\n\n274\n00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.340\nSomebody is coming in via the network and\ndoing a malicious thing.\n\n275\n00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.230\nI'm doing a port scan right now.\n\n276\n00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.940\nI'm starting with port 1 and\nthen 2 and then 3, 4, 5 and 6.\n\n277\n00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.300\nOn the other hand they can say,\nwell, that's really weird.\n\n278\n00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.270\nWhy would you connect\nto all these in a row?\n\n279\n00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.270\nYou must be doing a port scan.\n\n280\n00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.660\nAnd they can shut me down.\n\n281\n00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.970\nThey can stop me.\n\n282\n00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.310\nThat's why you don't see a lot of\npeople use ports one through ten.\n\n283\n00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:27.900\nBecause if somebody scans one through ten,\n\n284\n00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:32.220\nthat's a great indicator they're doing\na port scan and so they just stop it.\n\n285\n00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.110\nAnd so it might be that I've already\nbeen stopped, and I don't know it.\n\n286\n00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.210\nThere's services like Fail2ban.\n\n287\n00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:42.090\nFail2ban is a application, here we go,\nit's an open source product that\n\n288\n00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:46.530\nyou run on a server, and it watches for\nmalicious activities, intrusion detection.\n\n289\n00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.150\nBut it's also intrusion prevention.\n\n290\n00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.590\nIf it sees somebody trying\nto log in too many times,\n\n291\n00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:55.020\nlike doing a brute force password attack,\nit'll just block their IP.\n\n292\n00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:55.821\nOkay?\nI'm not gonna let\n\n293\n00:13:55.821 --> 00:13:56.832\nthem keep guessing passwords.\n\n294\n00:13:56.832 --> 00:14:01.400\nI'm gonna stop their IP from accessing\nthe server and it blacklists them, right?\n\n295\n00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.970\nThese types of packages can really help.\n\n296\n00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.760\nSomebody starts a port scan and\n\n297\n00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.050\nit blocks them before they even get to\nthe ports that they wanted to scan.\n\n298\n00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.370\nNow they can't even try an exploit\n\n299\n00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.750\nbecause they got stopped while they\nwere doing their reconnaissance scan.\n\n300\n00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.970\nSo these are great ways\nthat we can prevent that.\n\n301\n00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:20.920\nBut it also means it's a great way we\ncan accidentally lock out our users.\n\n302\n00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.530\nSo you have an end user who tries\nthe password four times and\n\n303\n00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.030\nnow they can't get to the server anymore.\n\n304\n00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:28.622\nSo we go and reset their password and\nthey still can't get to the server.\n\n305\n00:14:28.622 --> 00:14:31.680\nBecause Fail2ban has blocked them out and\nI need to go and allow them there.\n\n306\n00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.690\nSo you need to make sure you have good\ndocumentation of any security sublayers\n\n307\n00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.740\nyou put in place, so you can say all\nright, if somebody gets locked out\n\n308\n00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.910\nI need to reset their password, I need to\nreset Fail2ban on this server or whatever,\n\n309\n00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.080\nI need to look in these places so\nyou know how to troubleshoot that.\n\n310\n00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.490\nThe more security\nsublayers you put in place,\n\n311\n00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.390\nthe more spots where somebody\ncould potentially get blocked.\n\n312\n00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.990\nSo always be aware of that.\n\n313\n00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.470\nAll right, what else do we have?\n\n314\n00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:01.720\nSpeaking of security sublayers, we have\nother things like local policies and\n\n315\n00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.440\ngroup policies on servers.\n\n316\n00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.860\nIn the last episode I talked\na little bit about App Locker and\n\n317\n00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:11.300\nI fired up a Windows server here and\nI showed you the security policy.\n\n318\n00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.730\nIf I remember right I did secpol.msc,\nthere we go.\n\n319\n00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.470\nThat pulls up my local security policy,\n\n320\n00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.310\nit even says right here\nlocal security policy.\n\n321\n00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:24.100\nSo, this is the security\npolicy on this one server.\n\n322\n00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.890\nWhat if I have 1000 servers?\n\n323\n00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:29.560\nI don't wanna have to go and\nupdate this policy 1000 times.\n\n324\n00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:34.170\nSo if you have a Windows Active Directory,\ninstead of setting up a local policy,\n\n325\n00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:35.850\nyou can setup a group policy.\n\n326\n00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:37.980\nA policy that applies to\nmore than one server.\n\n327\n00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.550\nAnd you can even do both.\n\n328\n00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.930\nWe have a local and a group policy.\n\n329\n00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:46.750\nAnd just like sharing file permissions,\nthese two mix together also.\n\n330\n00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.420\nSo if a user is getting blocked,\nthey could be getting blocked\n\n331\n00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.240\nbecause of a local policy or because\nof a group policy or because of both.\n\n332\n00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.399\nAnd I would need to know to go and\ndouble check those.\n\n333\n00:15:55.399 --> 00:15:57.191\nNow what I'm in here is\nthe local security policy.\n\n334\n00:15:57.191 --> 00:15:59.531\nThis server is not on a domain.\n\n335\n00:15:59.531 --> 00:16:00.739\nAt least I don't think it is.\n\n336\n00:16:00.739 --> 00:16:05.257\nSo it might not have, let's see,\nit does have the group policy editor.\n\n337\n00:16:05.257 --> 00:16:08.870\nWell, it's the local group policy\neditor cuz I'm not in the domain.\n\n338\n00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.450\nBut if I were in a domain\nI would actually be seeing\n\n339\n00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:15.140\nadditional group policies that I\ncould get in and start to manipulate.\n\n340\n00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.900\nAnd you'll see here where we can\nset computer restrictions and\n\n341\n00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.420\nuser restrictions.\n\n342\n00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.540\nAnd the difference in a domain is that I\ncan apply this to hundreds, thousands,\n\n343\n00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.480\ntens of thousands of computers.\n\n344\n00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.850\nOne policy applying across all of those\nservers, even multiple locations.\n\n345\n00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.490\nIt's a really powerful technology.\n\n346\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.060\nIt's the same policy.\n\n347\n00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.690\nIt's just being applied at a different\nlevel to cover more machines.\n\n348\n00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.850\nSo definitely make sure you check those\nbecause it could be a policy defined here\n\n349\n00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.808\nthat's stopping you from being able\nto allow a user to perform an action.\n\n350\n00:16:43.808 --> 00:16:48.930\nAll right, a couple of other things.\n\n351\n00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:53.140\nSometimes, obviously in\na perfect world we would prevent\n\n352\n00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.470\ncompromises before they happened,\nright, that's what we would like.\n\n353\n00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.960\nBut what if you suspect you've\nbeen compromised already,\n\n354\n00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.060\nthat somebody's already in the system?\n\n355\n00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.370\nNormally we look to the logs for\n\n356\n00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.910\nthat, but if they're covering\ntheir tracks really well.\n\n357\n00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.940\nYou might not even be able to see that.\n\n358\n00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.310\nSo the only other thing that\nwe really have to look for\n\n359\n00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.230\nare strange files appearing.\n\n360\n00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.450\nThat shouldn't been there or\nthat weren't there before.\n\n361\n00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.140\nAnd road processes, right.\n\n362\n00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.520\nSo what's a road process?\n\n363\n00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.790\nA road process is any application running\non your server that you didn't run.\n\n364\n00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.850\nSimple as that,\nit's like weeds in the yard.\n\n365\n00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:24.780\nWhat's a weed?\n\n366\n00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.199\nA weed is any flower that you don't like.\n\n367\n00:17:27.199 --> 00:17:30.440\nIt's still a flower, you just\ndon't like it, so now it's a weed.\n\n368\n00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.950\nThat's what a rogue application is.\n\n369\n00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.290\nAn application that somebody else ran, not\nyou, that you didn't want running there.\n\n370\n00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:36.690\nHow do you spot that?\n\n371\n00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:40.143\nWell, you can go into your task manager,\nand hopefully find it there, or\n\n372\n00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:41.993\nin your process list in Unix and Linux.\n\n373\n00:17:41.993 --> 00:17:46.180\nBut there's root kits that get really\nadvanced and really start to hide things.\n\n374\n00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.420\nSo that's where your intrusion\nprevention systems and\n\n375\n00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.270\nintrusion detection really come in.\n\n376\n00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:51.300\nIs that they can look for\n\n377\n00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.840\nthings that are below that operating\nsystem level to try and find it.\n\n378\n00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.810\nThere's also other utilities\nthat are out there.\n\n379\n00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.610\nLike, somewhere around here,\nI can show you.\n\n380\n00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.010\nA utility called HiJackThis.\n\n381\n00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:07.190\nHiJackThis has been around a long time,\nit doesn't prevent compromises.\n\n382\n00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.030\nActually I have it running already.\n\n383\n00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.270\nThere it is.\n\n384\n00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.650\nIt doesn't prevent compromise,\nit just lets you find them.\n\n385\n00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:14.250\nOkay?\n\n386\n00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.010\nThis is running on a Windows system.\n\n387\n00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:21.050\nAnd we can scan the system and it's going\nto look for things like browser hook\n\n388\n00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:25.797\nobjects and registry key entries and\nthings that shouldn't be there.\n\n389\n00:18:25.797 --> 00:18:28.110\nOr things that it just doesn't know.\n\n390\n00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.810\nSo it will list some things\nin here that are normal.\n\n391\n00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:33.420\nLike here's a Microsoft default web page,\nthat's okay,\n\n392\n00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.525\nit's a Microsoft default web page.\n\n393\n00:18:34.525 --> 00:18:38.389\nHiJackThis doesn't judge, it just says,\nhey, this is here, I want you to see it.\n\n394\n00:18:38.389 --> 00:18:41.790\nAnd these are getting into BHOs,\nbrowser hook objects.\n\n395\n00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:45.820\nEvery time I run a web browser\nit's gonna run this hook object.\n\n396\n00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.920\nWell, if it's malware that's going\nto cause my system to do bad things.\n\n397\n00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.835\nHere's it's Java which you\ncould argue is malware.\n\n398\n00:18:51.835 --> 00:18:54.480\n[LAUGH] But it's gonna call that,\nis that okay?\n\n399\n00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.440\nAnd if it's not, I can remove it.\n\n400\n00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.100\nI can get that out of here.\n\n401\n00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.531\nHere's some unknown files that it found or\nwhatever.\n\n402\n00:19:01.531 --> 00:19:04.604\nEach of these could\npotentially be a compromise or\n\n403\n00:19:04.604 --> 00:19:06.910\nthey could be perfectly normal.\n\n404\n00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:07.980\nThis is a clean server.\n\n405\n00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.660\nSo all of these things that we see\nhere in the list are clean and\n\n406\n00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.210\nnormal things that I expect to see.\n\n407\n00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:14.726\nBut if I see something new there\nthat I wasn't counting on,\n\n408\n00:19:14.726 --> 00:19:16.450\nnow I've got a bigger problem, right?\n\n409\n00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:20.010\nI don't know what that is.\n\n410\n00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.130\nAnd I need to research it and find out.\n\n411\n00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.030\nI may have already been compromised.\n\n412\n00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:28.510\nAuditing software like this is great\nbecause you can do a baseline.\n\n413\n00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.090\nI can run this when the server\nis configured normal and\n\n414\n00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:32.740\nthen put it in the production.\n\n415\n00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.220\nAnd then after a few months,\nI can run it again and compare the list.\n\n416\n00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:39.470\nAnything new pop up, that might be\nsome kind of rogue application or\n\n417\n00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:44.510\nother process or browser hook object or\nwhatever that I didn't expect to have.\n\n418\n00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:48.940\nAnd as simple as taking a screenshot\nof the Task Manager even,\n\n419\n00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.410\nif we just pull up our\nprocess list like this.\n\n420\n00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:55.170\nAnd we grab a screenshot of that,\nI can run that against\n\n421\n00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.440\nsomething in the future to compare\nthe two and get a good list.\n\n422\n00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.020\nThere's command line utilities that do\na better job of that, like PS list or\n\n423\n00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:06.450\nin the Linux and Unix world you just have\nthe PS command, which is super useful.\n\n424\n00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.990\nCuz you can save it to a text file, and\nthen run comparisons down the road.\n\n425\n00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.350\nIt does make life very easy to\nlocate those road processes.\n\n426\n00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.200\nAll right, I think I've pretty much\n\n427\n00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.830\ncovered everything, and just a couple of\nodds and ends, which are I'm gonna throw\n\n428\n00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:21.400\nin here at the end cuz they didn't\nreally fit in anywhere else.\n\n429\n00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.010\nIn another episode I mentioned how\nuseful the Telnet utility can be.\n\n430\n00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:29.039\nI talked about open ports, and\nI ran nmap and scanned for the ports.\n\n431\n00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.520\nJust seeing the port is open doesn't\nnecessarily tell you a ton about it.\n\n432\n00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.890\nBut you can use the telnet\ncommand to test those ports out.\n\n433\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.510\nSo if I go back to that Linux\nservice that I scanned, and\n\n434\n00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:44.970\nit showed these different ports that were\nopened, I might see port 25 as open, SMTP.\n\n435\n00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:49.150\nAnd I think to myself, I didn't install\nSMTP, I didn't install a mail server.\n\n436\n00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:49.770\nWhat the heck is that?\n\n437\n00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.410\nWhat program is that?\n\n438\n00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.530\nI need to figure out\nwho's got that port open.\n\n439\n00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.580\nWell, netstat is what I'd normally go to.\n\n440\n00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.710\nNetstat will tell me\nwho has that port open.\n\n441\n00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:03.090\nBut I can also telnet into\nmy own system on port 25.\n\n442\n00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:07.810\nTelnet usually uses port 23, but\nif I use port 25, it'll connect and,\n\n443\n00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:12.140\nwell assuming I have\nthe Telnet client installed.\n\n444\n00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.310\nWhoops.\nA lot of people don't install Telnet\n\n445\n00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:16.240\nanymore because it's not encrypted.\n\n446\n00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.000\nBut as a troubleshooting tool\nit's actually pretty handy.\n\n447\n00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.900\nAnd so I can get that installed and\nthen I can Telnet into port 25.\n\n448\n00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.680\nAnd there I get a message.\n\n449\n00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.330\nESMTP Postfix.\n\n450\n00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.630\nIt just told me who was doing it.\n\n451\n00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:28.470\nI can look and see.\n\n452\n00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.150\nApparently I'm running Postfix.\n\n453\n00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:35.210\nAnd so I can say, well, I can try and\nget out of the Telnet session.\n\n454\n00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:45.070\nAnd there we go, and so then I can do\na systemctl status postfix.service.\n\n455\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.960\nAnd sure enough, I'm running that service.\n\n456\n00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:52.890\nAnd if I don't want it,\nI can come in here and do a stop postfix.\n\n457\n00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:57.020\nAnd get that thing stopped,\ndisabled, remove it, or\n\n458\n00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.830\nI can go into my documentation and\nfind out why am I running postfix?\n\n459\n00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.490\nMaybe I need it for something, right?\n\n460\n00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.770\nWell it's installed by\ndefault on Red Hat Server,\n\n461\n00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.238\nbecause postfix is used\nto send email alerts.\n\n462\n00:22:07.238 --> 00:22:09.710\nIf I configure an alerting system,\nso I actually kind of need that.\n\n463\n00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:12.140\nBut here I identify it,\nI spot it and I can deal with it.\n\n464\n00:22:13.252 --> 00:22:16.560\nAll right, the last thing that I\nwanna mention before I wrap up\n\n465\n00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.660\nis that when you start troubleshooting\nit's getting harder every year.\n\n466\n00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:24.020\nIt's getting harder because more and\nmore traffic is encrypted.\n\n467\n00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.390\nSo you fire up something\nlike Wire Shark and\n\n468\n00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:27.970\nyou just see a bunch of encrypted stuff.\n\n469\n00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:28.540\nYou see a lot of TLS.\n\n470\n00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.440\nYou don't even know what protocol it is.\n\n471\n00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.500\nYou don't know is it HTTP,\nis it FTP, what is it?\n\n472\n00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.140\nWho knows?\n\n473\n00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.970\nWe just see TLS, we see encrypted traffic.\n\n474\n00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.740\nThat's difficult because\nwe're using a cypher, right?\n\n475\n00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:45.900\nThe cypher will be some encryption\nalgorithm, maybe it's RSA or\n\n476\n00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.700\nTLS version two or\nwhatever it is that it's using.\n\n477\n00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.720\nWell I guess TLS isn't\ntechnically the cypher there.\n\n478\n00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.360\nThe cypher would be AES or\nsomething like that.\n\n479\n00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.940\nBut there's so many different ciphers and\nunless you have the private key you can't\n\n480\n00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.500\ndecipher, you can't decode\nthe data to look at it.\n\n481\n00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:04.214\nWell if you're gonna troubleshoot a web\nserver and the traffic is encrypted,\n\n482\n00:23:04.214 --> 00:23:06.812\nyou may need to get the private key for\nthat web server.\n\n483\n00:23:06.812 --> 00:23:09.713\nSo that you can load it into wire shark or\nwhatever software you're using so\n\n484\n00:23:09.713 --> 00:23:11.720\nthat it'll be able to decrypt the traffic.\n\n485\n00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.820\nIf you have the private key you can\ndecrypt that encrypted traffic.\n\n486\n00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.460\nLook at your sniffer,\nyour protocol analyzer, and\n\n487\n00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.410\nread the documentation on it.\n\n488\n00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.320\nIt will usually have instructions for\nthat.\n\n489\n00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.308\nIf you do that it gives you\nthe visibility, you can see and\n\n490\n00:23:24.308 --> 00:23:28.231\ntroubleshoot a lot better, but it also\nputs you at risk because now you're\n\n491\n00:23:28.231 --> 00:23:31.050\nhanding that private key on\nthe more than one system.\n\n492\n00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.070\nAnd private keys need to be protected.\n\n493\n00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.400\nSo always be very careful with that.\n\n494\n00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.650\nIf you have a sniffer computer,\nit should be a dedicated sniffer computer,\n\n495\n00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:39.080\nnot your own laptop.\n\n496\n00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.040\nBecause then, you take your own\nlaptop home, somebody steals it,\n\n497\n00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.710\nand the private key is\nthere in your laptop.\n\n498\n00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:44.680\nAnd now it's a problem.\n\n499\n00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.457\nBut if you have a dedicated sniffer\nthat stays locked in a server room or\n\n500\n00:23:47.457 --> 00:23:49.824\nlocked in a vault where the private\nkeys are stored anyway.\n\n501\n00:23:49.824 --> 00:23:52.645\nAnd you just break it out when you need\nit, that's much more safe and reliable.\n\n502\n00:23:52.645 --> 00:23:53.940\nSo always be aware that.\n\n503\n00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.736\nPrivate keys need to be kept private,\nbut because so\n\n504\n00:23:56.736 --> 00:23:59.926\nmuch data is encrypted these\ndays that can cause problems.\n\n505\n00:23:59.926 --> 00:24:01.748\nIt even causes problems on simple things.\n\n506\n00:24:01.748 --> 00:24:06.176\nFor example, well here like let's\nsay I fire up A web browser and\n\n507\n00:24:06.176 --> 00:24:09.878\nI browsed to our firewall\nright here in the building.\n\n508\n00:24:09.878 --> 00:24:14.860\nSo the ITProTV firewall,\nlet me just browse to that, okay.\n\n509\n00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:18.940\nI'm gonna browse to it and I get this\nmessage, my connection is not secure.\n\n510\n00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.540\nWhat the heck is that all about?\n\n511\n00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.580\nWell, I might have a firewall\nthat's running old software.\n\n512\n00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.670\nThat's using a cypher\nthat's no longer supported.\n\n513\n00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:30.350\nWe say SSL, nobody supports SSL anymore.\n\n514\n00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:33.865\nGoogle Chrome, Firefox, they block SSL.\n\n515\n00:24:33.865 --> 00:24:35.529\nSSL's been replaced by TLS.\n\n516\n00:24:35.529 --> 00:24:38.018\nNow most of us still call\nit SSL just out of habit.\n\n517\n00:24:38.018 --> 00:24:39.145\nBut it's now TLS.\n\n518\n00:24:39.145 --> 00:24:41.938\nAnd even TLS 1.0 is\nblocked by most people.\n\n519\n00:24:41.938 --> 00:24:45.522\nSo it's TLS 1.1, or 1.2, 1.3.\n\n520\n00:24:45.522 --> 00:24:47.520\nThat's what you'll normally see.\n\n521\n00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.240\nSo, it's telling me my connection's\nnot secure and that could be that I'm\n\n522\n00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.190\nusing an unsupported cypher,\nlike one of the old cyphers.\n\n523\n00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:56.760\nIt could be that\nthe certificate is expired.\n\n524\n00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.040\nIt could be that the certificate was\nissued by somebody I don't trust, and\n\n525\n00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.560\nthat's actually what's going on here.\n\n526\n00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.570\nIf you hit Advanced,\nit'll tell you what's going on.\n\n527\n00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:08.010\nAnd mine says it uses an invalid\nsecurity certificate.\n\n528\n00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:11.150\nIt's not trusted because it's self-signed,\nright?\n\n529\n00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.850\nWe generated our own and\nso it doesn't trust it.\n\n530\n00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:16.930\nIt's not expired, it's not using\nan old cipher, but in this case,\n\n531\n00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.580\nthat's why it's expired.\n\n532\n00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.470\nOr why it's not being trusted.\n\n533\n00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:23.160\nI'm trying to think,\ndo we have an old device on the network?\n\n534\n00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.730\nIf we have an old device,\nit's a challenge you bump into.\n\n535\n00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:29.790\nActually the I-low board,\n\n536\n00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:33.670\nthat HP server I have has an expired\ncertificate on it right now.\n\n537\n00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:37.050\nSo if I were to browse to that one,\n\n538\n00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:41.320\nif I can, actually,\nthat's not its IP address anymore, is it?\n\n539\n00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.288\nIt's something different.\n\n540\n00:25:42.288 --> 00:25:47.620\nIt's .29 maybe?\n\n541\n00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.480\nThere we go.\n\n542\n00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.300\nSo I tried to browse to this host,\nand I'm getting a message,\n\n543\n00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.840\nYour connection is not secure.\n\n544\n00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.430\nAnd if I go into Advanced, it's telling\nme it's using an invalid certificate.\n\n545\n00:25:56.430 --> 00:26:00.170\nIt's telling me that, well,\nit's saying it's self-signed.\n\n546\n00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:01.830\nWell, shoot.\n\n547\n00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.940\nAll right, I thought that was expired.\n\n548\n00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:04.530\nI guess it's not.\n\n549\n00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.860\nBut you'll find sometimes\na site that only does SSL.\n\n550\n00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.650\nI see it on network printers where they\nhaven't updated their firmware yet\n\n551\n00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:11.840\nto replace it for\ntheir management interface.\n\n552\n00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.570\nWhen that happens, you might just have\nto say, I can't do anything about it.\n\n553\n00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:20.040\nI can't change that firmware, so\nI'll add an exception in my browser.\n\n554\n00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.390\nI'll allow that traffic so\nI can get to it.\n\n555\n00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:24.810\nBut, in reality,\nwhat you need to do is try and fix it.\n\n556\n00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:25.870\nCan I issue a new certificate?\n\n557\n00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:29.920\nIf it's expired like the one on this\nboard, it just says it's self-signed.\n\n558\n00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.860\nSo could I issue a signed\ncertificate to it?\n\n559\n00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.540\nI probably could, right?\n\n560\n00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.750\nSo if I do that, great.\n\n561\n00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.604\nIf I don't,\nthen what else is gonna happen?\n\n562\n00:26:37.604 --> 00:26:41.273\nWell, if I look here, I can see\nthis one's set to expire, in 2022.\n\n563\n00:26:41.273 --> 00:26:43.960\nSo it's not expiring anytime soon,\nso it'll be good.\n\n564\n00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:49.040\nIt actually does have a SHA-256\nfingerprint, so that's good and secure.\n\n565\n00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.800\nSo it looks okay on\nevery other standpoint.\n\n566\n00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:58.930\nBut I was hoping to see if it was using,\nhere, this signature algorithm.\n\n567\n00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:02.270\nIt's using MD5 with RSA Encryption.\n\n568\n00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.180\nThat'll probably send up a red flag too.\n\n569\n00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.996\nBut once I put the exception in,\nwe won't see that.\n\n570\n00:27:05.996 --> 00:27:07.815\nSo, these are all things\nto think about also.\n\n571\n00:27:07.815 --> 00:27:12.014\nThat when you do encryption, sometimes we\nphase out some of the encryption ciphers.\n\n572\n00:27:12.014 --> 00:27:13.637\nBecause they're not\nconsidered secure anymore.\n\n573\n00:27:13.637 --> 00:27:15.093\nAnd if you're still using them,\n\n574\n00:27:15.093 --> 00:27:17.870\nyour end users might start\ngetting errors like these.\n\n575\n00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:22.440\nAnd you'll either need to accept that\nerror and move past it or go in and\n\n576\n00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.100\ncorrect it.\n\n577\n00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.154\nAnd ideally, we'll go in and correct it.\n\n578\n00:27:25.154 --> 00:27:28.787\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, well we've moved\nthrough a lot of great security concepts.\n\n579\n00:27:28.787 --> 00:27:30.711\nAnd hopefully you've learned\na lot out there, but\n\n580\n00:27:30.711 --> 00:27:33.004\nit does look like we are coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n581\n00:27:33.004 --> 00:27:34.252\nBut before we do, Don.\n\n582\n00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:35.707\nI don't think I'd be doing the viewers any\n\n583\n00:27:35.707 --> 00:27:36.476\njustice-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n584\n00:27:36.476 --> 00:27:38.063\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If I didn't give\n\n585\n00:27:38.063 --> 00:27:40.575\nyou a chance to say any final words.\n\n586\n00:27:40.575 --> 00:27:42.585\n&gt;&gt; In three parts of security\ntroubleshooting I think I've said\n\n587\n00:27:42.585 --> 00:27:43.225\nenough words.\n\n588\n00:27:43.225 --> 00:27:46.885\nI don't have too much else to add except\nunderstand that this is constantly\n\n589\n00:27:46.885 --> 00:27:47.476\nchanging.\n\n590\n00:27:47.476 --> 00:27:50.118\nAnd the only real solution here\nis constant vigilance, right?\n\n591\n00:27:50.118 --> 00:27:51.657\nI mean, watching your network.\n\n592\n00:27:51.657 --> 00:27:54.257\nLook for issues, and just try and\nunderstand when somebody\n\n593\n00:27:54.257 --> 00:27:56.990\nreports a problem,\nall the systems that are involved.\n\n594\n00:27:56.990 --> 00:28:00.680\nThink about from their web browser,\nor whatever their computer is,\n\n595\n00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.650\nall the way to the server they're\naccessing, what's all in between.\n\n596\n00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.510\nCuz any one of those can cause a problem,\n\n597\n00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:08.268\nit's not necessarily just your\nserver causing the issue.\n\n598\n00:28:08.268 --> 00:28:09.668\nAnd then troubleshoot from there.\n\n599\n00:28:09.668 --> 00:28:12.607\nThere are a lot of different moving\npieces in today's solutions.\n\n600\n00:28:12.607 --> 00:28:17.370\n&gt;&gt; All right, security is a journey to be\ntraveled on, never a destination to reach.\n\n601\n00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:19.510\nWell, Don, thank you for\nbeing here in the studios with us, and\n\n602\n00:28:19.510 -->

I'm Don Pezet.\n\n605\n00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.187\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n606\n00:28:27.187 --> 00:28:33.082\n[MUSIC]\n\n607\n00:28:33.082 --> 00:28:36.587\nThank you for watching
