ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.888 --> 00:00:14.387\nWe're launching this series to cover\nthe new SK0-004 exam and this is for\n\n4\n00:00:14.387 --> 00:00:19.364\nthe CompTIA Server+ certification which is\ntargeted towards anyone who works inside\n\n5\n00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:22.600\nof an IT data center or\nis looking to work there.\n\n6\n00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.740\nIn a smaller medium environment,\nyou may only have a handful of servers and\n\n7\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.990\nsupporting them is not much different\nthan supporting a workstation.\n\n8\n00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.850\nBut once you get into a larger\nenterprise environment,\n\n9\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.590\nmanaging large quantities of\nservers becomes pretty challenging.\n\n10\n00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.000\nAnd actually doing trouble shooting and\nwarranty repairs and server maintenance,\n\n11\n00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.590\ninstallation really becomes a very\ndifferent beast than it does with\n\n12\n00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.960\nsupporting a work station.\n\n13\n00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.550\nSo we need to understand the differences,\nunderstand how we're supposed\n\n14\n00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.940\nto handle servers and\nmake sure that they're done in a stable,\n\n15\n00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.800\nconsistent environment, which is what's\nrequired to run an enterprise data center.\n\n16\n00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.330\nSo let's take a little bit\nof a look at the exam.\n\n17\n00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.430\nFirst off, the CompTIA Server+\nexam is from CompTIA, so\n\n18\n00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.712\nit carries the same weight as A+ or\n\n19\n00:01:03.712 --> 00:01:08.630\nNET+, That it tries to give you a vendor\nneutral approach to managing servers.\n\n20\n00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.975\nThis is the SK0-004, and\nif you look on their website,\n\n21\n00:01:11.975 --> 00:01:16.183\nthey'll reference the older one,\nthe SK0-003, the previous exam.\n\n22\n00:01:16.183 --> 00:01:19.805\nThe previous exam did a great job\nof covering server technologies but\n\n23\n00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:22.680\nlike any technology,\nthey change pretty rapidly, so\n\n24\n00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.240\nin 2015 it was updated to\nreflect the new changes.\n\n25\n00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.220\nNew changes include just\nnew technologies and\n\n26\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.250\nadvancements as people move towards\nmore cloud-like infrastructure and\n\n27\n00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.910\nother technologies have kind of changed\nthe way that we look at servers.\n\n28\n00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.630\nThe exam itself hasn't\nchange as far as the format.\n\n29\n00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.300\nIt's still a 100 question multiple\nchoice computer based exam.\n\n30\n00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.170\nYou can take it Pearson vue,\ntesting centers located around the world.\n\n31\n00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.130\nIf you ever go to the vue website vue.com,\nyou can do a search for\n\n32\n00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.380\ntesting location centers that in your vue.\n\n33\n00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.290\nThey're everywhere so\n\n34\n00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.670\nyou can usually find them within maybe\na 45 minute drive of where you're at.\n\n35\n00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.540\nWhen you take the exam,\nit is a 90 minute exam.\n\n36\n00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.950\nSo 100 questions, only 90 minutes.\n\n37\n00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.680\nYou're expected to know the data, to be\nable to move through that pretty quickly,\n\n38\n00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.610\nless than one minute per question.\n\n39\n00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.640\nSo you've gotta get that done.\n\n40\n00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.970\nBut it is scaled where you\nonly need 750 points to pass.\n\n41\n00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.220\nSo you can get a handful wrong and\nstill be all right.\n\n42\n00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.870\nAs far as a prerequisite,\n\n43\n00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.180\nyou don't have to be working in a data\ncenter to get a Server+ certification, but\n\n44\n00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.590\nthey do expect you to at least\nhave the A+ certification.\n\n45\n00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.300\nYou need to understand\nhardware components.\n\n46\n00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.380\nUnderstand how a hard drive works,\nhow network adapters work.\n\n47\n00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.000\nUnderstand the basic hardware\ncomponents of any system.\n\n48\n00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.460\nAnd then we're gonna look at it\nfrom the server side of things.\n\n49\n00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.890\nSo you can learn and get ready for that.\n\n50\n00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.800\nThe typical target candidate is going to\nhave 18 to 24 months of IT experience or\n\n51\n00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.030\nthe equivalent of that experience.\n\n52\n00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.980\nYou might not even working in IT but\nif you've studying, practicing,\n\n53\n00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.858\ndoing this as a hobby from home, you may\nalready have the same level of experience,\n\n54\n00:02:53.858 --> 00:02:55.590\nand you'll be ready to move right in.\n\n55\n00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.250\nIf you find yourself getting\noverwhelmed with Server+,\n\n56\n00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.230\nyou can always take a step back and\njump down to A +.\n\n57\n00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.690\nThey don't mention it here but\nI do recommend Network+ also.\n\n58\n00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.720\nIf you have A+ and Network+,\nyou'll have a great foundation and\n\n59\n00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.060\nnone of the topics in\nServer+ will blow your mind.\n\n60\n00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.590\nIt's really just enhancing, building on\ntop of those topics that you learned from\n\n61\n00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.550\na work station perspective and\nmoving into the server level.\n\n62\n00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.940\nNow from there, the certification exam,\nitself is $294 USD, if you're in the US.\n\n63\n00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.160\nBut if you're outside of the US, the\npricing is all right here on the webpage.\n\n64\n00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.940\nIt is just one exam, which is nice.\n\n65\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.460\nOne exam, you pass, and\nyou get your Server+ certification.\n\n66\n00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.180\nSo a great certification to have.\n\n67\n00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.640\nAs far as getting ready for\nthe exam, well,\n\n68\n00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.320\nthere's plenty of content out\nthere like The ITProTV content.\n\n69\n00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.580\nAnd what we do is we cover\neach of the objectives, and\n\n70\n00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.980\nwe do it thoroughly to make sure\nyou prepared for that exam.\n\n71\n00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.980\nNow the content is broken\nup into seven domains,\n\n72\n00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.090\neach domain covering a different\narea of server technologies.\n\n73\n00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.370\nAnd you'll see that each one\nis kind of subdivided and\n\n74\n00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.710\nweights a different amount on the exam.\n\n75\n00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.090\nSo for example, server architecture,\nwhich is just general concepts for\n\n76\n00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.540\nhow server environments are built out,\nis 12% of the exam.\n\n77\n00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.740\nBut server administration, keeping the\nservers running, that's 24% of the exam.\n\n78\n00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.250\nIt's almost a quarter of the exam\nright out of that one objective.\n\n79\n00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.362\nStorage is another 12%,\nwe've got security beyond that for 13%,\n\n80\n00:04:16.362 --> 00:04:19.743\nnetworking at 10%,\ndisaster recovery is only 9%, and\n\n81\n00:04:19.743 --> 00:04:24.454\nthat's because a lot of IT workers are not\ninvolved in the disaster recovery process\n\n82\n00:04:24.454 --> 00:04:28.998\nthat we have, security, or information\nsecurity officers that are handling.\n\n83\n00:04:28.998 --> 00:04:33.421\nAnd if you're in the ISO type role, or\nCISO type role, you'll be heavily involved\n\n84\n00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:37.273\nin that, but if you're working in the NOC,\nyou might be responsible for\n\n85\n00:04:37.273 --> 00:04:42.120\ndetecting the disaster, but not\nactually resolving or resuming from it.\n\n86\n00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.230\nAnd then troubleshooting is another 20%,\nbecause once our servers are up and\n\n87\n00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.130\nrunning they have a habit\nof not staying that way.\n\n88\n00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.510\nSo, we need to be able to troubleshoot,\nisolate the problems, and\n\n89\n00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.580\nget them back up and\nrunning and healthy again.\n\n90\n00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.750\nSo, a distribution here is not very even,\nright?\n\n91\n00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.255\nThe bulk of the exam questions are gonna\ncome from server administration and\n\n92\n00:04:59.255 --> 00:05:03.410\ntroubleshooting and then the other ones\nget kind of sprinkled across from there.\n\n93\n00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.590\nNow each of these domains is\nbroken up into a ton of topics and\n\n94\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.350\nif I went over them here this\noverview would be an hour long.\n\n95\n00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.720\nBut if you go to CompTIA's website\nyou can download the exam objectives,\n\n96\n00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.830\nthis list right here.\n\n97\n00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.100\nIt will show you each one.\n\n98\n00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.040\nSo for example, server architecture covers\nform factors, components, cooling and\n\n99\n00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.100\npower, all those different things that are\ninside of the servers and make them go.\n\n100\n00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.080\nServer administration,\nhow do we install an operating system?\n\n101\n00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.380\nWhat are the different server\nroles available, and so on?\n\n102\n00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.380\nAll of this is broken down,\nand it is, at first,\n\n103\n00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.900\nan intimidating amount of information.\n\n104\n00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.650\nBut you'll there actually is a bit of\noverlap between them as you go through and\n\n105\n00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.740\nso all starts to kind of snap together but\n\n106\n00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.070\nthey've divided it up to\nmake it easier to consume.\n\n107\n00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.580\nI can focus in on one area.\n\n108\n00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.610\nI'm gonna focus just\non server maintenance.\n\n109\n00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.720\nI'm not worried about installation and\ndisaster.\n\n110\n00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.490\nLet's just do maintenance and then as each\none goes you learn more and more they\n\n111\n00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.810\nbuild on top of each other and before\nyou know it, you're ready for that exam.\n\n112\n00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.720\nI do encourage you to go to CompTIA's\nwebsite and download the exam objectives.\n\n113\n00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.260\nIt's a great way to, to just track\nyour own training to make sure.\n\n114\n00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.079\nYou've learned each of\nthe topic as you go through.\n\n115\n00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:11.550\nNow once you've studied your content,\nyou're ready to take the exam.\n\n116\n00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.560\nAnd if you're an ITProTV subscriber,\n\n117\n00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.540\nyou've got access to practice\nexams through Transcender right?\n\n118\n00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.590\nWe have those available as\npart of your subscription and\n\n119\n00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.750\nwe also have practice labs available,\nwhere you can fire up servers and\n\n120\n00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.990\nactually run through some step\nby step exercises on Windows and\n\n121\n00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.990\nLinux based systems to reinforce\nthe knowledge that you're learning here.\n\n122\n00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.150\nSome of the knowledge is hardware based,\nthough.\n\n123\n00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.470\nAnd so during the show we do our best to\nbring a real server up here on the screen,\n\n124\n00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.470\nand actually show you how to perform\nmaintenance, and other activities,\n\n125\n00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.930\non the physical box, cuz you might\nnot have one that's available to you,\n\n126\n00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.640\nalthough you can go on eBay and\npick them up pretty inexpensively, or\n\n127\n00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.870\nif you work for\nan organization that already has servers,\n\n128\n00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.500\nthey may have older ones that you can\nexperiment with and kind of get used to\n\n129\n00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.270\ninstead of practicing on the production\nservers which is always dangerous.\n\n130\n00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.330\nAll right, well if all of that\nsounds exciting to you and\n\n131\n00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.660\nthis is what you wanna learn,\nyou're in the right place.\n\n132\n00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.000\nWe're gonna be tackling it\nall in the upcoming episodes.\n\n133\n00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.300\nAgain, if it sounds a little intimidating,\ndon't worry.\n\n134\n00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.750\nReach out to A+, reach out to Net+\nfirst and once you get through those,\n\n135\n00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.460\nthe rest of this just builds right\non top and it's not a big deal.\n\n136\n00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.552\nBut if you're here to learn about servers,\n\n137\n00:07:13.552 --> 00:07:16.951\nstay tuned because the Server+\nepisodes are starting coming up next.\n\n138\n00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.262\n[SOUND]\n\n",
