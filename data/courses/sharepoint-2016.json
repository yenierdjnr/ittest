ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.293 --> 00:00:14.311\nI am Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n5\n00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:19.001\nAnd we're here to start recording\nour SharePoint 2016 series.\n\n6\n00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:23.637\nSo here to tell you a little bit more\nabout what to expect from the upcoming\n\n7\n00:00:23.637 --> 00:00:25.470\nvideos is Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n8\n00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.510\nHow is it going, Mark?\n\n9\n00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.140\n>> Good, Mike, thanks very much.\n\n10\n00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.450\nWe have a lot to cover, and what's new?\n\n11\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.830\nWhat can SharePoint do?\n\n12\n00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.120\nWhat can't it do?\n\n13\n00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.900\nWe finally have a mature product now.\n\n14\n00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.220\nThe first version came out in 2001,\nwhich was a bit of a going show,\n\n15\n00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.070\nfrankly, but through major revisions and\nrefinement and feedback,\n\n16\n00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.220\nMicrosoft's got a stellar product.\n\n17\n00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.960\nIs it perfect?\n\n18\n00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.460\nNo.\n\n19\n00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.650\nCan it do a lot?\n\n20\n00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.650\nYes.\nIt can mean many things to many people.\n\n21\n00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.680\nSo I'm excited to tell you about all\nthe ways where SharePoint can help you\n\n22\n00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.898\nstreamline your workflows,\nyour collaboration and so much more.\n\n23\n00:00:59.898 --> 00:01:03.730\nSo we're gonna cover a bunch of\nthe objectives that we'll be talking about\n\n24\n00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.850\nin the episodes to come.\n\n25\n00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.400\n>> Very good, Mark.\n\n26\n00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.286\nNow is this course, are we gonna\nbe talking from the ground up,\n\n27\n00:01:09.286 --> 00:01:12.827\nlike somebody that's not familiar with\nSharePoint, never used it before,\n\n28\n00:01:12.827 --> 00:01:14.248\nis this a good course for them?\n\n29\n00:01:14.248 --> 00:01:18.285\n>> Absolutely, with no assumed prior\nSharePoint knowledge, a background,\n\n30\n00:01:18.285 --> 00:01:22.511\na general background in IT and working\nwith information is certainly useful but\n\n31\n00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:23.596\nwe assume nothing.\n\n32\n00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:26.871\n>> [LAUGH] And then for people that\nare familiar with SharePoint but\n\n33\n00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:31.220\nmaybe are new to SharePoint 2016,\nprobably be a good fit for them as well.\n\n34\n00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.710\n>> Absolutely, so what's in it for\nthe experienced SharePoint administrator?\n\n35\n00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.080\nMicrosoft has put a lot of\ninvestment into SharePoint Online.\n\n36\n00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.020\nIn fact, all the development really\nover the past number of years,\n\n37\n00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.240\na lot in SharePoint Online.\n\n38\n00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.670\nSo we'll all be working in some kind\nof hybrid environment eventually,\n\n39\n00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.230\nif not a pure\nSharePoint Online environment.\n\n40\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.206\nOf course, with that ties in with O 365,\nso if you're not in the cloud\n\n41\n00:01:55.206 --> 00:01:59.629\nnow it's time to jump on even in\na trial environment with Azure.\n\n42\n00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:01.823\nIt's definitely the future and\nthe future is now.\n\n43\n00:02:01.823 --> 00:02:02.867\nSo you wanna be ahead of the curve.\n\n44\n00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:08.235\nSo that's the reason for it, if you're an\nexperienced SharePoint administrator but\n\n45\n00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:11.922\ndo not yet use cloud services,\nthis course is also for you.\n\n46\n00:02:11.922 --> 00:02:12.770\n>> Very good.\n\n47\n00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.320\nSo, what kind of topics are we gonna cover\nas we progress through these episodes.\n\n48\n00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.920\n>> Well, we'll look at first\nan introduction to SharePoint,\n\n49\n00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.260\nsome of the key functionality.\n\n50\n00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.520\nAgain, it can be many\nthings to many people.\n\n51\n00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.890\nWe don't cover all\nthe technology of SharePoint.\n\n52\n00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.735\nWe have an advanced class for that.\n\n53\n00:02:28.735 --> 00:02:29.330\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> However,\n\n54\n00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.410\nyou'll get a good grounding and then we'll\nlook at a lot of the success of your\n\n55\n00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.070\nSharePoint deployment actually has\nnothing to do with touching the keyboard.\n\n56\n00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.320\nI'm talking about governance and planning.\n\n57\n00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.792\nSo the expression goes,\nif you don't have time to plan,\n\n58\n00:02:41.792 --> 00:02:43.345\nyou have to make time to plan later.\n\n59\n00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:48.238\nIn other words, after you've screwed up,\nplowed straight ahead without thinking,\n\n60\n00:02:48.238 --> 00:02:51.066\nsort of the ready, fire,\naim approach, right?\n\n61\n00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:53.370\nOr we'll fix it later, no.\n\n62\n00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.060\nSo we really slow you down\nin the beginning modules\n\n63\n00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.620\nlooking at things like\nan information architecture.\n\n64\n00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.020\nSo if you do deploy SharePoint and\nyou're new to product,\n\n65\n00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.540\nit's a great time to look at\nyour existing information,\n\n66\n00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.460\nhow it's stored, often with mergers and\nmaybe moving physical locations.\n\n67\n00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.992\nA lot of literal and\nfigurative IT related junk goes with you.\n\n68\n00:03:13.992 --> 00:03:16.710\nSo maybe a good time to\nprune out the old and\n\n69\n00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.130\nalso to standardize on classifications for\ndata.\n\n70\n00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.520\nSo that a customer for example,\nin the sales department\n\n71\n00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.810\nmeans the same thing as a customer\nin the marketing department.\n\n72\n00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.990\nIn terms of the data, how we describe\na customer, the data we retain etc.\n\n73\n00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.010\nSo, again governance is a key part of the\nsuccess of your SharePoint deployments.\n\n74\n00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.030\nWe talk about design and\ninformation architecture.\n\n75\n00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.780\nAnd then we go into designing,\nboth logical and physical architectures.\n\n76\n00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.910\nSo, how is information gonna flow?\n\n77\n00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.260\nHow many SharePoint service do\nyou need in your environment?\n\n78\n00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.560\nAre you gonna go hybrid?\n\n79\n00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.465\nAre you gonna go with\nthe purely online environment?\n\n80\n00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.366\nLot of questions to ask.\n\n81\n00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.025\nOffice 365 integration?\n\n82\n00:03:55.025 --> 00:03:56.430\nAre you gonna choose Yammer?\n\n83\n00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.390\nAre you integrating SharePoint\nwith Exchange and Lync?\n\n84\n00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.389\nI know I've asked a lot of questions here.\n\n85\n00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:01.063\n>> Wow, yeah.\n\n86\n00:04:01.063 --> 00:04:05.167\n>> But these are some of the questions\nwe'll answer as you watch the episodes and\n\n87\n00:04:05.167 --> 00:04:07.331\nwatch the demos and our witty repartee.\n\n88\n00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:10.943\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Some of the jokes are lame frankly,\n\n89\n00:04:10.943 --> 00:04:13.700\nbut you take it with the bad,\nit's a mixed bag.\n\n90\n00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.510\nSo installing configuring the product,\nwe get into that.\n\n91\n00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.922\nNot at first, we get into that\nlater because again, we really want\n\n92\n00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:26.150\nyou to consider the governance aspects and\nthe planning first before installing.\n\n93\n00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.824\nSo, we'll look at farm settings, so\nSharePoint farm is your entire SharePoint\n\n94\n00:04:30.824 --> 00:04:34.204\ndeployment, what settings have\nto be made at that level.\n\n95\n00:04:34.204 --> 00:04:39.038\nProvisioning of farm settings like\nincoming email and outgoing email,\n\n96\n00:04:39.038 --> 00:04:41.821\nintegration with Office WebApp Server.\n\n97\n00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:44.422\nAnd we show you how to\ncreate web applications and\n\n98\n00:04:44.422 --> 00:04:46.550\nsite collections in SharePoint.\n\n99\n00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.500\nSo a way of allowing for\nextending IIS websites to allow for\n\n100\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.358\nSharePoint functionality.\n\n101\n00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:54.610\nAnd with it,\nonce we create site collections,\n\n102\n00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.318\nthen we can start creating other objects,\ndocument libraries, sub-sites,\n\n103\n00:04:58.318 --> 00:05:02.530\net cetera, and really start using\nSharePoint for what it's intended for.\n\n104\n00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.620\nWe have a variety of service\napplications as well,\n\n105\n00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.020\nso we can provide services like search and\nbusiness connectivity services.\n\n106\n00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.550\nSo one of the great things about\nSharePoint, we can connect to\n\n107\n00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.980\nany organized data source and\nbring it into a SharePoint environment.\n\n108\n00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.710\nIn other words, have it searchable\nfrom within one interface.\n\n109\n00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.140\nSome people deploy SharePoint, their prime\ndriver is search because the user is so\n\n110\n00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.040\nfrazzled to having to go to multiple\ndata repositories with different search\n\n111\n00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.430\nterminology and queries just to try and\nextract data they need to do their job.\n\n112\n00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.759\nSo one of the topics we look at in this\ncourse as well is that users often spend\n\n113\n00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:41.641\n20 to 40% of their time throughout the\nwork week just looking for information,\n\n114\n00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:43.670\nnot even doing anything with it.\n\n115\n00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.280\nNot synthesizing, prioritizing,\ndeleting, forwarding,\n\n116\n00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.800\ncreating reports, not just looking for\nit and often they get frustrated and\n\n117\n00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.170\nrecreate it, a total waste of time.\n\n118\n00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.800\nSo by properly designing a search\ninterface in SharePoint, no matter where\n\n119\n00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.000\nthat data lives, inside your firewall,\ncompetitors' websites, news sources,\n\n120\n00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.693\ngovernment repositories, SQL databases,\nOracle databases, any organized data\n\n121\n00:06:07.693 --> 00:06:12.190\nsource can be indexed, searchable from\nSharePoint and have the results displayed.\n\n122\n00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.606\nAlso the content from those external and\n\n123\n00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:18.952\ninternal data resources can be\ndisplayed in a dashboard in SharePoint.\n\n124\n00:06:18.952 --> 00:06:22.774\nSo, that was Bill Gates' idea back\nin the day in the 90's I believe,\n\n125\n00:06:22.774 --> 00:06:26.686\nthe digital dashboard, he got\ncredited with that, that terminology.\n\n126\n00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:31.219\nSo the idea of you get information feeding\ninto one screen rather then you having to\n\n127\n00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:32.940\ngo look at it, it comes to you.\n\n128\n00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.365\nAnd that could be things like KPIs,\nstock reports, baseball scores.\n\n129\n00:06:37.365 --> 00:06:40.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Weather information,\n\n130\n00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.420\ninformation on your commute time.\n\n131\n00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.671\nOther KPIs like turnover,\nyear-to-date sales, whatever is important\n\n132\n00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:50.728\nto you can come to you as opposed to\nyou having to manually go look for it.\n\n133\n00:06:50.728 --> 00:06:55.107\nWe'll talk, we'll have that information\ndisplayed in a SharePoint context.\n\n134\n00:06:55.107 --> 00:06:58.995\nWe also, it can be very complicated if\nyou don't do it properly in terms of\n\n135\n00:06:58.995 --> 00:07:02.592\ngranting the right access to content\nin a SharePoint environment.\n\n136\n00:07:02.592 --> 00:07:05.525\nSo, as always,\nthe law of least privilege applies.\n\n137\n00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:10.250\nGive people just enough rights and\npermissions to do the job, but no more.\n\n138\n00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.020\nSometimes people get lazy and\nsay we'll make that person a local admin,\n\n139\n00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.272\nand then you hope they don't realize what\nthey can do with local admin privileges.\n\n140\n00:07:16.272 --> 00:07:17.045\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n141\n00:07:17.045 --> 00:07:20.490\nthat's often the fault of the application\ncreator because they didn't\n\n142\n00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.930\nconfigure the app properly so you have to\nprovide more permissions than possible.\n\n143\n00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.541\nBut in a SharePoint context, we'll\nshow you what permissions to apply and\n\n144\n00:07:27.541 --> 00:07:31.110\nwhere inheritance kicks in, and\nwhy you might wanna break inheritance?\n\n145\n00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.270\nAnd we'll look at different\nways of authenticating as well.\n\n146\n00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.800\nSo not just internally in\nour own organization but\n\n147\n00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.620\nhow can we provide a certain kind of\naccess to say partner organization so they\n\n148\n00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.350\ncan access certain documents or content on\nour SharePoint site, without the hassle of\n\n149\n00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.650\nus having to give them accounts in\nour active directory environment.\n\n150\n00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.280\nSo you might have set up\nfederation services before for\n\n151\n00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.530\nother kinds of collaboration between\norganizations, a similar process here.\n\n152\n00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:01.040\nWe'll show you exactly what to do to\nconfigure that partner authorization.\n\n153\n00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.460\nAnd then also we'll get into\nhardening the platform somewhat.\n\n154\n00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.140\nSecuring the platform so\nfarm level security, settings,\n\n155\n00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.720\nchanges to make in your\nSQL server backend,\n\n156\n00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:15.090\nto make hacking a little harder and make\nyour information a little more secure.\n\n157\n00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:19.780\nAlso we got total control over\nthe kinds of content people can save\n\n158\n00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.000\nin a SharePoint context.\n\n159\n00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.330\nWe'll look at how to block certain file\ntypes from living in your SharePoint\n\n160\n00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:24.850\nenvironment.\n\n161\n00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.420\nTaxonomy is a big part.\n\n162\n00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.270\nThis goes back to governance and planning.\n\n163\n00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.430\nSo taxonomy, a good example of\ntaxonomy is the duodecimal system.\n\n164\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:38.180\nIt's robust, it stood the test of time for\na 100 years or more.\n\n165\n00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.896\nSo, no matter if you went to college\n50 years ago or five years ago or\n\n166\n00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:45.525\nfive years in the future,\nthat duodecimal system still holds up.\n\n167\n00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:50.050\nIt still allows for\nthe classification of new knowledge and\n\n168\n00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.330\ncoexistence with old knowledge.\n\n169\n00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.198\nSo that is a kind of taxonomy, an example.\n\n170\n00:08:54.198 --> 00:09:01.770\nOther taxonomy examples from the world of\nspecies, fish, even plant life, rocks.\n\n171\n00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.490\nI mean there's a schema or an organized\nplan for how to classify that information.\n\n172\n00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.680\nSo, in a SharePoint context as it relates\nto your organization, you need to have\n\n173\n00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.520\na way of classifying information\nto make management of it easier.\n\n174\n00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.080\nBut also to make finding content or\n\n175\n00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.380\nthe findability of your\ninformation that much easier.\n\n176\n00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.655\nSo we'll look at metadata, which is\ninvolved in classifying and part of your\n\n177\n00:09:25.655 --> 00:09:31.580\ntaxonomy and why you probably want to\ncollect more metadata than you are now.\n\n178\n00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.625\nWe look at ways to automate that\ncollection process so that users aren't\n\n179\n00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:39.935\nhassled with having to enter multiple\nfields manually or pick from a list when\n\n180\n00:09:39.935 --> 00:09:44.146\nthey try and save a document in\na SharePoint document library for example.\n\n181\n00:09:44.146 --> 00:09:46.328\nUser profile is another\nsection of the course.\n\n182\n00:09:46.328 --> 00:09:50.687\nThis is great because we can import\ncontent from active directory so\n\n183\n00:09:50.687 --> 00:09:55.000\ninformation about individual users and\nadd to it big time.\n\n184\n00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.560\nSo we can surface more resources or\n\n185\n00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.230\nmore intellectual resources if you\nlike throughout our organization.\n\n186\n00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:06.990\nSo, it's said that 50 to 75% of what's\nneeded to run your organization comes,\n\n187\n00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.870\nor lives in the minds of employees.\n\n188\n00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.630\nIn other words, it's not documented\nanywhere, so that means I can't search for\n\n189\n00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.680\nit easily until now.\n\n190\n00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.160\nBecause with SharePoint user profiles,\nthere are built in fields for\n\n191\n00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.140\nthings like alma mater,\nhobbies, programming languages.\n\n192\n00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.710\nAnything you want to expose like that that\nthere's no active directory field for,\n\n193\n00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:30.670\nthere is in SharePoint.\n\n194\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.570\nWe can also create custom fields as well.\n\n195\n00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.420\nWhat this means is when I'm searching for\ninformation, say,\n\n196\n00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.669\non a programming language.\n\n197\n00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.760\nI dont just get some documentation,\nI can find Fred Smith\n\n198\n00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.730\nover in Anchorage is an expert in Python,\nfor example.\n\n199\n00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.244\nIm gonna ping Fred right now,\n\n200\n00:10:48.244 --> 00:10:51.592\nwith presence awareness\nI can see Fred's online.\n\n201\n00:10:51.592 --> 00:10:53.050\nIm gonna ping him and ask him a question.\n\n202\n00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.214\nOtherwise I would not necessarily have\nknown that Fred was a Python expert,\n\n203\n00:10:56.214 --> 00:10:59.850\nespecially if you have a large\ngeographically disbursed organization.\n\n204\n00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.660\nSo it can really make\n\n205\n00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.810\nemployees more resourceful to other\nemployees in the organization.\n\n206\n00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:08.940\nEnterprise search.\n\n207\n00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.620\nSo as I mentioned,\n\n208\n00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.950\nsearch is a big reason why people\ndeploy SharePoint in the first place.\n\n209\n00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.090\nI'm not saying it's easy to setup,\n\n210\n00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:20.610\nwe'll show you some of the basics to set\nup Enterprise search in your environment.\n\n211\n00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:25.560\nThat can be frankly a multi day process\nand a thing,s something you tweak over\n\n212\n00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:31.520\ntime to increase or improve the quality of\nthe results from various search queries.\n\n213\n00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.920\nSo I'm not gonna kid you here.\n\n214\n00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.560\nIt requires librarian type skills\n\n215\n00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.940\nto be able to properly service\ninformation from search results.\n\n216\n00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.430\nAnd then we'd be remiss if we\ndidn't tell you how to monitor and\n\n217\n00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.110\nmaintain your SharePoint environment.\n\n218\n00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:51.830\nSo things like optimizing, caching,\nwe'll look at how to look at log files.\n\n219\n00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.740\nHealth analyzer rules.\n\n220\n00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.824\nHow to monitor network traffic?\n\n221\n00:11:54.824 --> 00:11:58.315\nHow to monitor, maybe a page loads slowly,\nhow to analyze that so\n\n222\n00:11:58.315 --> 00:12:02.199\nyou can identify elements of the page\nthat are causing it to load slowly?\n\n223\n00:12:02.199 --> 00:12:04.254\nOften it's a poorly written web part.\n\n224\n00:12:04.254 --> 00:12:08.365\nWe'll look at how to secure your\nenvironment that way as well in terms of\n\n225\n00:12:08.365 --> 00:12:09.118\nweb parts and\n\n226\n00:12:09.118 --> 00:12:14.700\ncontent that users can access to maintain\nthe overall security of your environment.\n\n227\n00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.240\n>> All right, Mark,\n\n228\n00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.120\nsounds like we've got a lot of information\nto go over that's gonna help me implement,\n\n229\n00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.900\ndeploy, work with, manage, and\nmaintain my SharePoint environment.\n\n230\n00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.890\nThere's also an exam associated\nwith this information, correct?\n\n231\n00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:26.590\n>> Absolutely, Mike.\n\n232\n00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.430\nIt's the 70-339 exam from Microsoft,\n\n233\n00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:35.180\nso we'll cover all\nthe objectives on the exam.\n\n234\n00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.500\nWill you be able to pass the exam\nafter watching these episodes?\n\n235\n00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.042\nOf course not.\n\n236\n00:12:39.042 --> 00:12:40.018\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n237\n00:12:40.018 --> 00:12:41.950\n>> You gotta get some hands on.\n\n238\n00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.820\nAnd your day-to-day real world experience\nwith SharePoint will help tie you through.\n\n239\n00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:50.060\nGone are the days where you could just\nread a book or watch some videos and\n\n240\n00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.290\njust breeze in and\ncome out with a passing score.\n\n241\n00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.985\nSo I don't wanna get you\nunder any illusions.\n\n242\n00:12:53.985 --> 00:12:56.959\nHowever, we'll cover all the concepts\nthat do appear on the exam.\n\n243\n00:12:56.959 --> 00:13:00.824\nSo you're not gonna be surprised\nwhen you get hands on or\n\n244\n00:13:00.824 --> 00:13:04.700\nwhen you attempt the exam at\nthe questions that come up.\n\n245\n00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.660\n>> Very good Mark.\n\n246\n00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.960\nAll right, I'll tell you what, you've\ngot me excited about SharePoint 2016.\n\n247\n00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.852\nI hope everybody out there\nis as excited as I am.\n\n248\n00:13:11.852 --> 00:13:13.815\nIf you are, you are in the right place,\nstay tuned.\n\n249\n00:13:13.815 --> 00:13:16.891\nWe got some really exciting\nSharePoint episodes coming your way.\n\n250\n00:13:16.891 --> 00:13:25.959\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
