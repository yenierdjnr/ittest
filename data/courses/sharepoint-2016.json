ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.293 --> 00:00:14.311\nI am Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n5\n00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:19.001\nAnd we're here to start recording\nour SharePoint 2016 series.\n\n6\n00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:23.637\nSo here to tell you a little bit more\nabout what to expect from the upcoming\n\n7\n00:00:23.637 --> 00:00:25.470\nvideos is Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n8\n00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.510\nHow is it going, Mark?\n\n9\n00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.140\n>> Good, Mike, thanks very much.\n\n10\n00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.450\nWe have a lot to cover, and what's new?\n\n11\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.830\nWhat can SharePoint do?\n\n12\n00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.120\nWhat can't it do?\n\n13\n00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.900\nWe finally have a mature product now.\n\n14\n00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.220\nThe first version came out in 2001,\nwhich was a bit of a going show,\n\n15\n00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.070\nfrankly, but through major revisions and\nrefinement and feedback,\n\n16\n00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.220\nMicrosoft's got a stellar product.\n\n17\n00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.960\nIs it perfect?\n\n18\n00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.460\nNo.\n\n19\n00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.650\nCan it do a lot?\n\n20\n00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.650\nYes.\nIt can mean many things to many people.\n\n21\n00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.680\nSo I'm excited to tell you about all\nthe ways where SharePoint can help you\n\n22\n00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.898\nstreamline your workflows,\nyour collaboration and so much more.\n\n23\n00:00:59.898 --> 00:01:03.730\nSo we're gonna cover a bunch of\nthe objectives that we'll be talking about\n\n24\n00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.850\nin the episodes to come.\n\n25\n00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.400\n>> Very good, Mark.\n\n26\n00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.286\nNow is this course, are we gonna\nbe talking from the ground up,\n\n27\n00:01:09.286 --> 00:01:12.827\nlike somebody that's not familiar with\nSharePoint, never used it before,\n\n28\n00:01:12.827 --> 00:01:14.248\nis this a good course for them?\n\n29\n00:01:14.248 --> 00:01:18.285\n>> Absolutely, with no assumed prior\nSharePoint knowledge, a background,\n\n30\n00:01:18.285 --> 00:01:22.511\na general background in IT and working\nwith information is certainly useful but\n\n31\n00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:23.596\nwe assume nothing.\n\n32\n00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:26.871\n>> [LAUGH] And then for people that\nare familiar with SharePoint but\n\n33\n00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:31.220\nmaybe are new to SharePoint 2016,\nprobably be a good fit for them as well.\n\n34\n00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.710\n>> Absolutely, so what's in it for\nthe experienced SharePoint administrator?\n\n35\n00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.080\nMicrosoft has put a lot of\ninvestment into SharePoint Online.\n\n36\n00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.020\nIn fact, all the development really\nover the past number of years,\n\n37\n00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.240\na lot in SharePoint Online.\n\n38\n00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.670\nSo we'll all be working in some kind\nof hybrid environment eventually,\n\n39\n00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.230\nif not a pure\nSharePoint Online environment.\n\n40\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.206\nOf course, with that ties in with O 365,\nso if you're not in the cloud\n\n41\n00:01:55.206 --> 00:01:59.629\nnow it's time to jump on even in\na trial environment with Azure.\n\n42\n00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:01.823\nIt's definitely the future and\nthe future is now.\n\n43\n00:02:01.823 --> 00:02:02.867\nSo you wanna be ahead of the curve.\n\n44\n00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:08.235\nSo that's the reason for it, if you're an\nexperienced SharePoint administrator but\n\n45\n00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:11.922\ndo not yet use cloud services,\nthis course is also for you.\n\n46\n00:02:11.922 --> 00:02:12.770\n>> Very good.\n\n47\n00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.320\nSo, what kind of topics are we gonna cover\nas we progress through these episodes.\n\n48\n00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.920\n>> Well, we'll look at first\nan introduction to SharePoint,\n\n49\n00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.260\nsome of the key functionality.\n\n50\n00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.520\nAgain, it can be many\nthings to many people.\n\n51\n00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.890\nWe don't cover all\nthe technology of SharePoint.\n\n52\n00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.735\nWe have an advanced class for that.\n\n53\n00:02:28.735 --> 00:02:29.330\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> However,\n\n54\n00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.410\nyou'll get a good grounding and then we'll\nlook at a lot of the success of your\n\n55\n00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.070\nSharePoint deployment actually has\nnothing to do with touching the keyboard.\n\n56\n00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.320\nI'm talking about governance and planning.\n\n57\n00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.792\nSo the expression goes,\nif you don't have time to plan,\n\n58\n00:02:41.792 --> 00:02:43.345\nyou have to make time to plan later.\n\n59\n00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:48.238\nIn other words, after you've screwed up,\nplowed straight ahead without thinking,\n\n60\n00:02:48.238 --> 00:02:51.066\nsort of the ready, fire,\naim approach, right?\n\n61\n00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:53.370\nOr we'll fix it later, no.\n\n62\n00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.060\nSo we really slow you down\nin the beginning modules\n\n63\n00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.620\nlooking at things like\nan information architecture.\n\n64\n00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.020\nSo if you do deploy SharePoint and\nyou're new to product,\n\n65\n00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.540\nit's a great time to look at\nyour existing information,\n\n66\n00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.460\nhow it's stored, often with mergers and\nmaybe moving physical locations.\n\n67\n00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.992\nA lot of literal and\nfigurative IT related junk goes with you.\n\n68\n00:03:13.992 --> 00:03:16.710\nSo maybe a good time to\nprune out the old and\n\n69\n00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.130\nalso to standardize on classifications for\ndata.\n\n70\n00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.520\nSo that a customer for example,\nin the sales department\n\n71\n00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.810\nmeans the same thing as a customer\nin the marketing department.\n\n72\n00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.990\nIn terms of the data, how we describe\na customer, the data we retain etc.\n\n73\n00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.010\nSo, again governance is a key part of the\nsuccess of your SharePoint deployments.\n\n74\n00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.030\nWe talk about design and\ninformation architecture.\n\n75\n00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.780\nAnd then we go into designing,\nboth logical and physical architectures.\n\n76\n00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.910\nSo, how is information gonna flow?\n\n77\n00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.260\nHow many SharePoint service do\nyou need in your environment?\n\n78\n00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.560\nAre you gonna go hybrid?\n\n79\n00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.465\nAre you gonna go with\nthe purely online environment?\n\n80\n00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.366\nLot of questions to ask.\n\n81\n00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.025\nOffice 365 integration?\n\n82\n00:03:55.025 --> 00:03:56.430\nAre you gonna choose Yammer?\n\n83\n00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.390\nAre you integrating SharePoint\nwith Exchange and Lync?\n\n84\n00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.389\nI know I've asked a lot of questions here.\n\n85\n00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:01.063\n>> Wow, yeah.\n\n86\n00:04:01.063 --> 00:04:05.167\n>> But these are some of the questions\nwe'll answer as you watch the episodes and\n\n87\n00:04:05.167 --> 00:04:07.331\nwatch the demos and our witty repartee.\n\n88\n00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:10.943\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Some of the jokes are lame frankly,\n\n89\n00:04:10.943 --> 00:04:13.700\nbut you take it with the bad,\nit's a mixed bag.\n\n90\n00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.510\nSo installing configuring the product,\nwe get into that.\n\n91\n00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.922\nNot at first, we get into that\nlater because again, we really want\n\n92\n00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:26.150\nyou to consider the governance aspects and\nthe planning first before installing.\n\n93\n00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.824\nSo, we'll look at farm settings, so\nSharePoint farm is your entire SharePoint\n\n94\n00:04:30.824 --> 00:04:34.204\ndeployment, what settings have\nto be made at that level.\n\n95\n00:04:34.204 --> 00:04:39.038\nProvisioning of farm settings like\nincoming email and outgoing email,\n\n96\n00:04:39.038 --> 00:04:41.821\nintegration with Office WebApp Server.\n\n97\n00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:44.422\nAnd we show you how to\ncreate web applications and\n\n98\n00:04:44.422 --> 00:04:46.550\nsite collections in SharePoint.\n\n99\n00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.500\nSo a way of allowing for\nextending IIS websites to allow for\n\n100\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.358\nSharePoint functionality.\n\n101\n00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:54.610\nAnd with it,\nonce we create site collections,\n\n102\n00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.318\nthen we can start creating other objects,\ndocument libraries, sub-sites,\n\n103\n00:04:58.318 --> 00:05:02.530\net cetera, and really start using\nSharePoint for what it's intended for.\n\n104\n00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.620\nWe have a variety of service\napplications as well,\n\n105\n00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.020\nso we can provide services like search and\nbusiness connectivity services.\n\n106\n00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.550\nSo one of the great things about\nSharePoint, we can connect to\n\n107\n00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.980\nany organized data source and\nbring it into a SharePoint environment.\n\n108\n00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.710\nIn other words, have it searchable\nfrom within one interface.\n\n109\n00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.140\nSome people deploy SharePoint, their prime\ndriver is search because the user is so\n\n110\n00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.040\nfrazzled to having to go to multiple\ndata repositories with different search\n\n111\n00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.430\nterminology and queries just to try and\nextract data they need to do their job.\n\n112\n00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.759\nSo one of the topics we look at in this\ncourse as well is that users often spend\n\n113\n00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:41.641\n20 to 40% of their time throughout the\nwork week just looking for information,\n\n114\n00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:43.670\nnot even doing anything with it.\n\n115\n00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.280\nNot synthesizing, prioritizing,\ndeleting, forwarding,\n\n116\n00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.800\ncreating reports, not just looking for\nit and often they get frustrated and\n\n117\n00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.170\nrecreate it, a total waste of time.\n\n118\n00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.800\nSo by properly designing a search\ninterface in SharePoint, no matter where\n\n119\n00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.000\nthat data lives, inside your firewall,\ncompetitors' websites, news sources,\n\n120\n00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.693\ngovernment repositories, SQL databases,\nOracle databases, any organized data\n\n121\n00:06:07.693 --> 00:06:12.190\nsource can be indexed, searchable from\nSharePoint and have the results displayed.\n\n122\n00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.606\nAlso the content from those external and\n\n123\n00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:18.952\ninternal data resources can be\ndisplayed in a dashboard in SharePoint.\n\n124\n00:06:18.952 --> 00:06:22.774\nSo, that was Bill Gates' idea back\nin the day in the 90's I believe,\n\n125\n00:06:22.774 --> 00:06:26.686\nthe digital dashboard, he got\ncredited with that, that terminology.\n\n126\n00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:31.219\nSo the idea of you get information feeding\ninto one screen rather then you having to\n\n127\n00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:32.940\ngo look at it, it comes to you.\n\n128\n00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.365\nAnd that could be things like KPIs,\nstock reports, baseball scores.\n\n129\n00:06:37.365 --> 00:06:40.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Weather information,\n\n130\n00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.420\ninformation on your commute time.\n\n131\n00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.671\nOther KPIs like turnover,\nyear-to-date sales, whatever is important\n\n132\n00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:50.728\nto you can come to you as opposed to\nyou having to manually go look for it.\n\n133\n00:06:50.728 --> 00:06:55.107\nWe'll talk, we'll have that information\ndisplayed in a SharePoint context.\n\n134\n00:06:55.107 --> 00:06:58.995\nWe also, it can be very complicated if\nyou don't do it properly in terms of\n\n135\n00:06:58.995 --> 00:07:02.592\ngranting the right access to content\nin a SharePoint environment.\n\n136\n00:07:02.592 --> 00:07:05.525\nSo, as always,\nthe law of least privilege applies.\n\n137\n00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:10.250\nGive people just enough rights and\npermissions to do the job, but no more.\n\n138\n00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.020\nSometimes people get lazy and\nsay we'll make that person a local admin,\n\n139\n00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.272\nand then you hope they don't realize what\nthey can do with local admin privileges.\n\n140\n00:07:16.272 --> 00:07:17.045\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n141\n00:07:17.045 --> 00:07:20.490\nthat's often the fault of the application\ncreator because they didn't\n\n142\n00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.930\nconfigure the app properly so you have to\nprovide more permissions than possible.\n\n143\n00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.541\nBut in a SharePoint context, we'll\nshow you what permissions to apply and\n\n144\n00:07:27.541 --> 00:07:31.110\nwhere inheritance kicks in, and\nwhy you might wanna break inheritance?\n\n145\n00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.270\nAnd we'll look at different\nways of authenticating as well.\n\n146\n00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.800\nSo not just internally in\nour own organization but\n\n147\n00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.620\nhow can we provide a certain kind of\naccess to say partner organization so they\n\n148\n00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.350\ncan access certain documents or content on\nour SharePoint site, without the hassle of\n\n149\n00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.650\nus having to give them accounts in\nour active directory environment.\n\n150\n00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.280\nSo you might have set up\nfederation services before for\n\n151\n00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.530\nother kinds of collaboration between\norganizations, a similar process here.\n\n152\n00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:01.040\nWe'll show you exactly what to do to\nconfigure that partner authorization.\n\n153\n00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.460\nAnd then also we'll get into\nhardening the platform somewhat.\n\n154\n00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.140\nSecuring the platform so\nfarm level security, settings,\n\n155\n00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.720\nchanges to make in your\nSQL server backend,\n\n156\n00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:15.090\nto make hacking a little harder and make\nyour information a little more secure.\n\n157\n00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:19.780\nAlso we got total control over\nthe kinds of content people can save\n\n158\n00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.000\nin a SharePoint context.\n\n159\n00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.330\nWe'll look at how to block certain file\ntypes from living in your SharePoint\n\n160\n00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:24.850\nenvironment.\n\n161\n00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.420\nTaxonomy is a big part.\n\n162\n00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.270\nThis goes back to governance and planning.\n\n163\n00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.430\nSo taxonomy, a good example of\ntaxonomy is the duodecimal system.\n\n164\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:38.180\nIt's robust, it stood the test of time for\na 100 years or more.\n\n165\n00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.896\nSo, no matter if you went to college\n50 years ago or five years ago or\n\n166\n00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:45.525\nfive years in the future,\nthat duodecimal system still holds up.\n\n167\n00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:50.050\nIt still allows for\nthe classification of new knowledge and\n\n168\n00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.330\ncoexistence with old knowledge.\n\n169\n00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.198\nSo that is a kind of taxonomy, an example.\n\n170\n00:08:54.198 --> 00:09:01.770\nOther taxonomy examples from the world of\nspecies, fish, even plant life, rocks.\n\n171\n00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.490\nI mean there's a schema or an organized\nplan for how to classify that information.\n\n172\n00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.680\nSo, in a SharePoint context as it relates\nto your organization, you need to have\n\n173\n00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.520\na way of classifying information\nto make management of it easier.\n\n174\n00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.080\nBut also to make finding content or\n\n175\n00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.380\nthe findability of your\ninformation that much easier.\n\n176\n00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.655\nSo we'll look at metadata, which is\ninvolved in classifying and part of your\n\n177\n00:09:25.655 --> 00:09:31.580\ntaxonomy and why you probably want to\ncollect more metadata than you are now.\n\n178\n00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.625\nWe look at ways to automate that\ncollection process so that users aren't\n\n179\n00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:39.935\nhassled with having to enter multiple\nfields manually or pick from a list when\n\n180\n00:09:39.935 --> 00:09:44.146\nthey try and save a document in\na SharePoint document library for example.\n\n181\n00:09:44.146 --> 00:09:46.328\nUser profile is another\nsection of the course.\n\n182\n00:09:46.328 --> 00:09:50.687\nThis is great because we can import\ncontent from active directory so\n\n183\n00:09:50.687 --> 00:09:55.000\ninformation about individual users and\nadd to it big time.\n\n184\n00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.560\nSo we can surface more resources or\n\n185\n00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.230\nmore intellectual resources if you\nlike throughout our organization.\n\n186\n00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:06.990\nSo, it's said that 50 to 75% of what's\nneeded to run your organization comes,\n\n187\n00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.870\nor lives in the minds of employees.\n\n188\n00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.630\nIn other words, it's not documented\nanywhere, so that means I can't search for\n\n189\n00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.680\nit easily until now.\n\n190\n00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.160\nBecause with SharePoint user profiles,\nthere are built in fields for\n\n191\n00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.140\nthings like alma mater,\nhobbies, programming languages.\n\n192\n00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.710\nAnything you want to expose like that that\nthere's no active directory field for,\n\n193\n00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:30.670\nthere is in SharePoint.\n\n194\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.570\nWe can also create custom fields as well.\n\n195\n00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.420\nWhat this means is when I'm searching for\ninformation, say,\n\n196\n00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.669\non a programming language.\n\n197\n00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.760\nI dont just get some documentation,\nI can find Fred Smith\n\n198\n00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.730\nover in Anchorage is an expert in Python,\nfor example.\n\n199\n00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.244\nIm gonna ping Fred right now,\n\n200\n00:10:48.244 --> 00:10:51.592\nwith presence awareness\nI can see Fred's online.\n\n201\n00:10:51.592 --> 00:10:53.050\nIm gonna ping him and ask him a question.\n\n202\n00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.214\nOtherwise I would not necessarily have\nknown that Fred was a Python expert,\n\n203\n00:10:56.214 --> 00:10:59.850\nespecially if you have a large\ngeographically disbursed organization.\n\n204\n00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.660\nSo it can really make\n\n205\n00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.810\nemployees more resourceful to other\nemployees in the organization.\n\n206\n00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:08.940\nEnterprise search.\n\n207\n00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.620\nSo as I mentioned,\n\n208\n00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.950\nsearch is a big reason why people\ndeploy SharePoint in the first place.\n\n209\n00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.090\nI'm not saying it's easy to setup,\n\n210\n00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:20.610\nwe'll show you some of the basics to set\nup Enterprise search in your environment.\n\n211\n00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:25.560\nThat can be frankly a multi day process\nand a thing,s something you tweak over\n\n212\n00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:31.520\ntime to increase or improve the quality of\nthe results from various search queries.\n\n213\n00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.920\nSo I'm not gonna kid you here.\n\n214\n00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.560\nIt requires librarian type skills\n\n215\n00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.940\nto be able to properly service\ninformation from search results.\n\n216\n00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.430\nAnd then we'd be remiss if we\ndidn't tell you how to monitor and\n\n217\n00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.110\nmaintain your SharePoint environment.\n\n218\n00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:51.830\nSo things like optimizing, caching,\nwe'll look at how to look at log files.\n\n219\n00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.740\nHealth analyzer rules.\n\n220\n00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.824\nHow to monitor network traffic?\n\n221\n00:11:54.824 --> 00:11:58.315\nHow to monitor, maybe a page loads slowly,\nhow to analyze that so\n\n222\n00:11:58.315 --> 00:12:02.199\nyou can identify elements of the page\nthat are causing it to load slowly?\n\n223\n00:12:02.199 --> 00:12:04.254\nOften it's a poorly written web part.\n\n224\n00:12:04.254 --> 00:12:08.365\nWe'll look at how to secure your\nenvironment that way as well in terms of\n\n225\n00:12:08.365 --> 00:12:09.118\nweb parts and\n\n226\n00:12:09.118 --> 00:12:14.700\ncontent that users can access to maintain\nthe overall security of your environment.\n\n227\n00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.240\n>> All right, Mark,\n\n228\n00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.120\nsounds like we've got a lot of information\nto go over that's gonna help me implement,\n\n229\n00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.900\ndeploy, work with, manage, and\nmaintain my SharePoint environment.\n\n230\n00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.890\nThere's also an exam associated\nwith this information, correct?\n\n231\n00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:26.590\n>> Absolutely, Mike.\n\n232\n00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.430\nIt's the 70-339 exam from Microsoft,\n\n233\n00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:35.180\nso we'll cover all\nthe objectives on the exam.\n\n234\n00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.500\nWill you be able to pass the exam\nafter watching these episodes?\n\n235\n00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.042\nOf course not.\n\n236\n00:12:39.042 --> 00:12:40.018\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n237\n00:12:40.018 --> 00:12:41.950\n>> You gotta get some hands on.\n\n238\n00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.820\nAnd your day-to-day real world experience\nwith SharePoint will help tie you through.\n\n239\n00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:50.060\nGone are the days where you could just\nread a book or watch some videos and\n\n240\n00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.290\njust breeze in and\ncome out with a passing score.\n\n241\n00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.985\nSo I don't wanna get you\nunder any illusions.\n\n242\n00:12:53.985 --> 00:12:56.959\nHowever, we'll cover all the concepts\nthat do appear on the exam.\n\n243\n00:12:56.959 --> 00:13:00.824\nSo you're not gonna be surprised\nwhen you get hands on or\n\n244\n00:13:00.824 --> 00:13:04.700\nwhen you attempt the exam at\nthe questions that come up.\n\n245\n00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.660\n>> Very good Mark.\n\n246\n00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.960\nAll right, I'll tell you what, you've\ngot me excited about SharePoint 2016.\n\n247\n00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.852\nI hope everybody out there\nis as excited as I am.\n\n248\n00:13:11.852 --> 00:13:13.815\nIf you are, you are in the right place,\nstay tuned.\n\n249\n00:13:13.815 --> 00:13:16.891\nWe got some really exciting\nSharePoint episodes coming your way.\n\n250\n00:13:16.891 --> 00:13:25.959\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:20.827\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're going over SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.827 --> 00:00:24.985\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be taking\na look at some of the new features and\n\n5\n00:00:24.985 --> 00:00:28.940\ncapabilities that SharePoint 2016\nbrings to us in the IT world.\n\n6\n00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.020\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n7\n00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.070\nHow's it going Mark?\n\n8\n00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.210\n>> Going great, thanks Mike.\n\n9\n00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.500\nGood to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.032\nThere's a lot that SharePoint can do and\nwe'll certainly have a lot of demos,\n\n11\n00:00:39.032 --> 00:00:42.687\nsome hands-on showing you some\nof those nitty gritty things.\n\n12\n00:00:42.687 --> 00:00:45.133\nOne thing that's often overlooked though,\n\n13\n00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.907\nare the planning aspects\nof SharePoint 2016.\n\n14\n00:00:47.907 --> 00:00:49.962\nSome of you may have had familiarity and\n\n15\n00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:54.790\nexperience with SharePoint all the way\nback in 2001, the first major version.\n\n16\n00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.260\nAnd we've moved on since then to 2003,\n2007, 2010, 2013, so\n\n17\n00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.320\nthis is the sixth major\nrelease of SharePoint.\n\n18\n00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.525\nSo, a lot of people say it\ntakes a vendor three cracks.\n\n19\n00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:09.455\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> To get it right with any release\n\n20\n00:01:09.455 --> 00:01:10.954\nof new technology.\n\n21\n00:01:10.954 --> 00:01:13.494\nSo, for Microsoft,\nyou could argue that MOSS, or\n\n22\n00:01:13.494 --> 00:01:17.633\nMicrosoft Office SharePoint Server in\n2007 was that third major release, and\n\n23\n00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:20.547\nstarted getting real traction and\nwide spread adoption.\n\n24\n00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:22.288\nSome of the unhelpful,\n\n25\n00:01:22.288 --> 00:01:28.450\ninflexible architecture designs you were\nstuck with that you chose earlier on.\n\n26\n00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.493\nBut now we've got all\nkinds of flexibility and\n\n27\n00:01:31.493 --> 00:01:34.546\nthe ability to alter at\nany time our topology.\n\n28\n00:01:34.546 --> 00:01:39.975\nSo even those of you that have experience\nwith SharePoint might have skipped over.\n\n29\n00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:43.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because as IT pros and devs,\n\n30\n00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.360\nwe tend to wanna get\nright on to the hands-on.\n\n31\n00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.380\nJust give me the splash screen.\n\n32\n00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.384\n>> Get it installed,\nlet's play with it, let's do it.\n\n33\n00:01:48.384 --> 00:01:50.717\n>> Yeah, yeah, installed.\n\n34\n00:01:50.717 --> 00:01:55.277\n>> I think the saying here about if you\ndon't plan, you plan to fail, right?\n\n35\n00:01:55.277 --> 00:01:57.080\nSharePoint being no exception.\n\n36\n00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.210\nIt can be a relatively\ncomplex environment,\n\n37\n00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.490\ndepending on what you're setting up.\n\n38\n00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.590\n>> Absolutely, so the way to guarantee\nfailure with your SharePoint deployment is\n\n39\n00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.355\nto try and involve and install everything\nthat SharePoint can do at once.\n\n40\n00:02:09.355 --> 00:02:12.140\nThere's probably not a single\nenvironment in the world\n\n41\n00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.960\nthat is using everything\nthat SharePoint can offer.\n\n42\n00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.690\nSo the way to succeed is,\nfirst of all, know what you're doing.\n\n43\n00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.070\nWhy are you deploying\na SharePoint environment?\n\n44\n00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.320\nWhat can you expect from it?\n\n45\n00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.380\nWhat is SharePoint not good at?\n\n46\n00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.080\nAnd then take one at a time.\n\n47\n00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.560\nSo if you want to use it for a place\nto collaborate on documents, great.\n\n48\n00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.220\nSet up some team sites,\nmaybe an intranet portal.\n\n49\n00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.620\nBut don't go all out and move all your\ndata into SharePoint and then redesign all\n\n50\n00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.180\nyour workflows at the same time and\ndo some auditing and compliance work.\n\n51\n00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.782\nNo, that's a guarantee for failure.\n\n52\n00:02:45.782 --> 00:02:48.062\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, I've seen that happen.\n\n53\n00:02:48.062 --> 00:02:48.569\n>> True.\n\n54\n00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:49.689\n>> [CROSSTALK] been part\nof that unfortunately.\n\n55\n00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.150\n>> Yeah, so\nwe all have those horror stories.\n\n56\n00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.980\nIt's uncomfortable at best.\n\n57\n00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.360\nSo, the other thing with\nSharePoint that is huge,\n\n58\n00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.640\na huge part of the success\nof it is end user training.\n\n59\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.698\nSo you need to plan and\nbudget that in, why?\n\n60\n00:03:04.698 --> 00:03:05.792\nBecause users, well,\n\n61\n00:03:05.792 --> 00:03:08.867\nhuman beings like doing things\nthe way they've always done them.\n\n62\n00:03:08.867 --> 00:03:12.793\nSo if you're telling them now, okay,\nwe don't want you to save new content into\n\n63\n00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:15.852\nFileShare, no we want you to save\nit to a document library, and\n\n64\n00:03:15.852 --> 00:03:20.080\nthere's some unlearning and relearning\nto do, there's gonna be push back.\n\n65\n00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.328\nIf you've read Who Moved My Cheese?,\nyou'll know that we just resist change,\n\n66\n00:03:24.328 --> 00:03:28.707\neven if intellectually we can obviously\nsee yeah, this is a better solution.\n\n67\n00:03:28.707 --> 00:03:31.078\nSome people might say, well,\nI'm only 18 years from retirement,\n\n68\n00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:32.275\nI'm gonna keep doing it this way.\n\n69\n00:03:32.275 --> 00:03:34.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Unless we force them to\n\n70\n00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.990\nuse the new way.\n\n71\n00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.086\nBut the point is,\nlet's have empathy for end users and\n\n72\n00:03:38.086 --> 00:03:42.594\nit doesn't have to be formal classroom\ntraining, it could be video training,\n\n73\n00:03:42.594 --> 00:03:45.507\nmaybe you throw some\nintranet video tutorials up.\n\n74\n00:03:45.507 --> 00:03:49.009\nAnd then people can learn at their own\npace or just-in-time learning, but\n\n75\n00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:51.427\nwe're asking users to do\nthings in a different way.\n\n76\n00:03:51.427 --> 00:03:55.031\nSo, again, have some empathy, don't just\ncut over and announce after the fact okay,\n\n77\n00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:58.150\nthis is the new way of doing things,\nlet people know well in advance.\n\n78\n00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.271\nMaybe they can keep saving, for example,\nto their files servers, familiar shares,\n\n79\n00:04:02.271 --> 00:04:03.348\nup to a certain point.\n\n80\n00:04:03.348 --> 00:04:06.948\nAnd then you say you know what,\nit's read only, all new content,\n\n81\n00:04:06.948 --> 00:04:11.410\nespecially collaborative in nature,\nmust now be saved in a SharePoint context.\n\n82\n00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.650\n>> I've seen that specific thing cause\nfailures in SharePoint deployments,\n\n83\n00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.290\nwhere a company has invested lots of money\nin deploying SharePoint, a lot of energy,\n\n84\n00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.550\na lot of resources.\n\n85\n00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.635\nBut then don't follow up\nwith the training and\n\n86\n00:04:22.635 --> 00:04:25.424\nthe users end up not using it,\nthey stick with what they know.\n\n87\n00:04:25.424 --> 00:04:28.817\nThey try it, they think it's horrible,\nthey're like we don't like that.\n\n88\n00:04:28.817 --> 00:04:30.534\nAnd they go back to what\nthey're used to and\n\n89\n00:04:30.534 --> 00:04:33.110\nit's all because of a lack\nof training there I think.\n\n90\n00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.600\n>> Absolutely, Mike.\n\n91\n00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.800\nAnd then people blame Microsoft or\nthey blame the expensive license.\n\n92\n00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.020\nIt didn't work for us.\n\n93\n00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.570\n>> Yep.\n>> So,\n\n94\n00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.560\nmore than any other Microsoft\ntechnology I've worked with,\n\n95\n00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.051\nthe failure to plan\nappropriately with SharePoint,\n\n96\n00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:50.630\nit's gonna be an expensive mess and\ncause mass frustration.\n\n97\n00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.330\nAnd it will be worse than\nwhatever you're using currently.\n\n98\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.300\nHowever, having said that, the reason\nwhy SharePoint is my favorite Microsoft\n\n99\n00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.270\ntechnology is it can do so many things.\n\n100\n00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.000\nIs it perfect?\n\n101\n00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.630\nNo.\n\n102\n00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.920\nDoes it streamline workflow and\n\n103\n00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.480\neliminate duplication and allow for\nall kinds of collaboration?\n\n104\n00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.750\nYes, and\nthat's what we're gonna look at this week.\n\n105\n00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.867\nSo SharePoint's been\ncalled a Swiss Army knife,\n\n106\n00:05:13.867 --> 00:05:17.521\nanother way I like to describe\nit is if you had or a metaphor.\n\n107\n00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:21.840\nLet's say you had five blind people\ntrying to describe an elephant.\n\n108\n00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.310\nWell, depending on where\nthey were on the elephant,\n\n109\n00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.630\nthey'd have a completely\ndifferent experience.\n\n110\n00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.387\nSo someone might have a toenail,\ntrunk, ear.\n\n111\n00:05:28.387 --> 00:05:29.154\n>> Right.\n\n112\n00:05:29.154 --> 00:05:32.170\n>> And each person would swear,\nthis is how it is.\n\n113\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.230\nThis is how the elephant is.\n\n114\n00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.257\nAnd they'd be equally valid.\n\n115\n00:05:35.257 --> 00:05:36.837\nBut just a different perspective.\n\n116\n00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:40.991\nSo let's look at or talk about some\nof the things that SharePoint can do.\n\n117\n00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:43.000\nI mentioned document collaboration.\n\n118\n00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.350\nSo, for the typical user, they're okay.\n\n119\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.270\nOr the way they've probably\nbeen doing things is\n\n120\n00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.160\nwe'll just email an attachment back and\nforth 20 times.\n\n121\n00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.390\nAnd the version numbers may or\nmay not be in sync.\n\n122\n00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.367\nAnd who knows who made what change when.\n\n123\n00:05:56.367 --> 00:06:01.001\nAnd it fills up the Exchange store, so\nyour Exchange admins are not pleased plus,\n\n124\n00:06:01.001 --> 00:06:05.145\nagain, without version control you\ndon't know who made what changes.\n\n125\n00:06:05.145 --> 00:06:10.460\nSo, you can have a document\nlibrary set up in SharePoint.\n\n126\n00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.600\nAnd it's one place.\n\n127\n00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.624\nSo I can go, for example, and\ncheck out a document from the library.\n\n128\n00:06:16.624 --> 00:06:18.837\nThat means no one else can edit it,\nonly I can edit it.\n\n129\n00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:21.200\nAnd then when I've done\nmy edits I can check in.\n\n130\n00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.610\nAlso, you can enable document\nlibraries for simultaneous editing.\n\n131\n00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.770\nSo, three of us can be working on\nthe same document, for example,\n\n132\n00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.680\nat the very same time, and we could\neach see the edits made by the others.\n\n133\n00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.680\nBut the point is, we have one version.\n\n134\n00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.350\nWe can keep multiple versions if we want,\nbut there's not multiple misnamed,\n\n135\n00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.610\nor renamed versions\nflying around the email.\n\n136\n00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:42.297\nVery handy.\n\n137\n00:06:42.297 --> 00:06:43.260\n>> Absolutely.\n\n138\n00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:49.427\n>> So Bill Gates got credited with\nthis digital dashboard idea years ago.\n\n139\n00:06:49.427 --> 00:06:51.689\nAnd the idea was let's get one screen, or\n\n140\n00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:56.750\nwouldn't it be great to have one screen we\ncan go and have information coming to us.\n\n141\n00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.040\nSo a lot of companies now they have\ninformation in different repositories.\n\n142\n00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.580\nSo they might need different tools or\ndifferent kinds of\n\n143\n00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.660\nqueries to extract usable information\nfrom those different repositories.\n\n144\n00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.990\nSo wouldn't it be great, again,\nto have information coming in?\n\n145\n00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.150\nSo we have web parts\nare a way of servicing or\n\n146\n00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.902\nbring in data from other data,\nany organized data source, so\n\n147\n00:07:17.902 --> 00:07:22.990\nSQL databases, third party databases,\nWeather Channel, stock ticker,\n\n148\n00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.430\nbaseball scores, whatever you want set\nup in different places on your screen.\n\n149\n00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.517\nThen you don't have to go search for\nit, it comes to you.\n\n150\n00:07:30.517 --> 00:07:33.837\nAnd this can be part of an intranet\nhome page, for example.\n\n151\n00:07:33.837 --> 00:07:37.077\nSo the same technology we can use for\n\n152\n00:07:37.077 --> 00:07:41.610\nan intranet home page,\nwe can have team sites.\n\n153\n00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.060\nWe can have an extranet to\ncollaborate with partners.\n\n154\n00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.970\nWe can even make our Internet\nsite all hosted to SharePoint.\n\n155\n00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.880\nSo a lot of people now, they might have\na different solution for Internet,\n\n156\n00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.566\nextranet, an intranet pages.\n\n157\n00:07:53.566 --> 00:07:55.923\nDifferent tools, tough to manage.\n\n158\n00:07:55.923 --> 00:07:59.132\nSo by having a single source for\nthose pages,\n\n159\n00:07:59.132 --> 00:08:02.261\nMuch easier to manage\nin terms of security.\n\n160\n00:08:02.261 --> 00:08:04.779\nPeople need to allow access to\npeople outside our organization,\n\n161\n00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:06.850\nsince we are dealing with\nsuch a connected world now.\n\n162\n00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:11.620\nCollaborating suppliers, vendors\nneeding access to part of our network.\n\n163\n00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.270\nSo again, a Swiss Army Knife,\n\n164\n00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:20.040\nmany things that you can do with\nshare point compliance is another\n\n165\n00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.530\nuseful functionality built into SharePoint\nand the ability to audit access.\n\n166\n00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.800\nWe can use SharePoint as\na records management solution.\n\n167\n00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.890\nNow is it as good as a pricier third\nparty records management solution?\n\n168\n00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.860\nNo, is it 90% as good?\n\n169\n00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.320\nYes.\nAnd for many companies\n\n170\n00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.870\nthat's all they need.\n\n171\n00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.940\nSo again it's not like you\ncan just install SharePoint.\n\n172\n00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.320\nJust choose all the options and\nvoila, it's good to go.\n\n173\n00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.370\nIt requires planning.\n\n174\n00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.520\nSo that's why the information\narchitecture,\n\n175\n00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.130\nwhich we'll get to as our next\nmajor topic, is so important.\n\n176\n00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:59.150\nBecause what happens is, often people\nwill tend to okay, we got Sharepoint.\n\n177\n00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.390\nLet's move all the content to SharePoint,\nthat's not necessary.\n\n178\n00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.450\nAnother reason people deploy SharePoint\nis for the search architecture.\n\n179\n00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.590\nSo if all you did with\nSharePoint was set up search\n\n180\n00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:16.050\nwhich by the way is not a one and\ndone process either.\n\n181\n00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.160\nIt can take days, possibly weeks\nto correctly configure search for\n\n182\n00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.760\nyour environment but\n\n183\n00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.200\nthe benefit is it doesn't matter what\ndata type you have or the data source.\n\n184\n00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.980\nAs long as it's some kind of organized\ndata source, or even a web page,\n\n185\n00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:34.740\nfile shares, internal websites, external\nwebsites, any organized data source,\n\n186\n00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.910\nyou can crawl that content and\nbring it in, index it in SharePoint.\n\n187\n00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:45.540\nAnd it's one place users can go to search\nfor content no matter where it lives.\n\n188\n00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.320\n>> Wow.\n\n189\n00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.110\nSo this is actually, we'll get to\ninformation architecture later, but\n\n190\n00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:56.430\none of the benefits of search, if you\nset it up properly, is it can overcome\n\n191\n00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:01.750\ndeficiencies or complete lack of planning\nin terms of information architecture,\n\n192\n00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:06.940\nespecially a lot of companies, Mike,\nthat have been acquired or merged.\n\n193\n00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.710\nAnd then you've got disparate\ninformation architectures, and\n\n194\n00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.380\nyou kind of just throw them all together.\n\n195\n00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:19.070\nSome people like to move, moving houses or\noffices, and they take everything.\n\n196\n00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.765\nWhy, because well we might need it later.\n\n197\n00:10:20.765 --> 00:10:22.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or\n\n198\n00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.470\nin an IT context,\nwe have this old file from 20 years ago.\n\n199\n00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.850\nWe don't even have the software\nto open this file type anymore.\n\n200\n00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:28.810\nBut we might need it.\n\n201\n00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.420\nSo let's take it with us.\n\n202\n00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.710\nIt's ludicrous.\n\n203\n00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:35.370\nSo, all that clutter and\nbulk becomes problematic.\n\n204\n00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:40.380\nSo, another neat thing about SharePoint\nis you can use the deployment of it\n\n205\n00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.590\nas a reason or excuse if you like\n\n206\n00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:48.900\nto actually think through what should\nour information architect should be.\n\n207\n00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:53.210\nHow do if restoring from zero, how would\nwe lay out and organize our data and\n\n208\n00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:56.580\ninformation to make it easier for\nuses to find.\n\n209\n00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:01.170\nSo findability is a key\ncomponent of SharePoint.\n\n210\n00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.770\nThere's actually a great book\ncalled Ambient Findability.\n\n211\n00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:08.220\nIt's published by O'Reilly by renowned\ninformation architect who's name I forget.\n\n212\n00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.470\nBut it's a good read.\n\n213\n00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.018\nIronically, I lost my book\ncalled Ambient Findability.\n\n214\n00:11:12.018 --> 00:11:16.920\nAgain, it's not just enough\nto deploy SharePoint,\n\n215\n00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.719\nwe wanna make it easier on the users.\n\n216\n00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.940\n>> That's a challenge that we face\na lot of times especially nowadays with\n\n217\n00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.190\nthe organizations being so data dependant.\n\n218\n00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:33.650\nYou get stuff put in a file server here,\na file server there, and\n\n219\n00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:36.360\nyour users have to remember,\nokay where is this stuff located,\n\n220\n00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.560\nwas it on server 01/employeedocuments,\nwas it on server 02/something.\n\n221\n00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.340\nYou're telling me with SharePoint,\nwe can basically index\n\n222\n00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.310\nall of our different data sources and\nkind of getting it into one place.\n\n223\n00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.760\nI can see that being a good\nreason to deploy SharePoint.\n\n224\n00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.630\n>> Huge as well, so\n\n225\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:57.090\nagain we talked about being friends with\nour customers which are our employees.\n\n226\n00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:01.860\nRight and I think about internal customers\nwe need someone wearing the hat of,\n\n227\n00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.270\nor advocating for, the internal user.\n\n228\n00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.180\nAs opposed to treating\nthem as an afterthought.\n\n229\n00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.150\nSame with customers, but\nwe will leave that discussion alone.\n\n230\n00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.050\nSo think of our employes\nas internal customers,\n\n231\n00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:14.380\nhow can we make their jobs easier.\n\n232\n00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.760\nSo one way is to deploy search properly.\n\n233\n00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.925\nAnother way is to use navigational aides.\n\n234\n00:12:19.925 --> 00:12:22.420\nMm-hm, so they can find content.\n\n235\n00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.490\nThere was a study years ago.\n\n236\n00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.690\nI forgot the exact numbers, but\nwith statistics you can make up anything.\n\n237\n00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the gist of it is this, and\n\n238\n00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:30.740\nI'm not joking about this.\n\n239\n00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:34.380\nAnd that is,\npeople spend roughly ten to 40% of\n\n240\n00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.340\ntheir working hours just looking for\ncontent.\n\n241\n00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.050\n>> Really?\n\n242\n00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.460\n>> Just trying to find what\nthey need to do their job.\n\n243\n00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.530\nSo they're not even doing anything,\nadding value, they're not synthesizing,\n\n244\n00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.230\nthey're not using it to\nmake business decisions.\n\n245\n00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:50.180\nThey're just looking for\nsomething they know exists somewhere or\n\n246\n00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.750\nthey think it does but\nthey have to track it down.\n\n247\n00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.630\nSo that's a colossal waste of time.\n\n248\n00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.920\nAnd often people end up recreating\nthat document, for example,\n\n249\n00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.110\nthat they swore they saw\na couple months ago.\n\n250\n00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.620\nCan't find it.\n\n251\n00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.660\nI'll start over.\n\n252\n00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.000\nWhat a waste of time.\n\n253\n00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.280\nSo if we can deploy search and make\ncontent findable, we're really doing our\n\n254\n00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.590\nemployees a favor and then they'll\nbe better equipped to do their jobs,\n\n255\n00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:12.660\nwhat they're actually paid to do.\n\n256\n00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.190\nNobody should be paid to\nwaste time looking for\n\n257\n00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:17.990\ninformation required to do their job.\n\n258\n00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.680\nSo we're still talking\nabout all the things,\n\n259\n00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.190\ngeneral overview of what SharePoint can\ndo, or why companies may wanna deploy it.\n\n260\n00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:26.340\nBecause license isn't cheap.\n\n261\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.360\nSo you want to get the most out of it.\n\n262\n00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.610\nSo employee buy in for\n\n263\n00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.310\nsure, employee training, budgeting\nthat in right from the beginning.\n\n264\n00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.090\nAnd of course, training your admins,\nwhich if you're watching this,\n\n265\n00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:41.340\nI assume that you want to get\ntrained as well, which is fantastic.\n\n266\n00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:46.770\nSo, anything you can dream up in terms\nof business processes or work flow,\n\n267\n00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.780\nif it can be done electronically,\nwe can do it in SharePoint.\n\n268\n00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.773\nSo years ago when Bill Gates was still at\nMicrosoft he asked about, company-wide,\n\n269\n00:13:54.773 --> 00:13:58.680\nhow many paper-based processes are there,\nhe wanted to know.\n\n270\n00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.330\nAnd I don't know what the number was but\nwhen he found out, he hit the roof.\n\n271\n00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.560\nI mean we're a technology company,\nwhy are we still using so\n\n272\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.340\nmany paper-based processes?\n\n273\n00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.640\nSo the point is, with work flows, and\n\n274\n00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.030\nthere are some built in tools with\nSharePoint, very primitive tools for\n\n275\n00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.600\nthings like approval work flows that say\nyou need to get your boss, and your boss'\n\n276\n00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.660\nboss to sign off on an expense report,\nfor example, before the check gets cut.\n\n277\n00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.500\nThat's pretty basic.\n\n278\n00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.830\nWith SharePoint designer,\nwhich, by the way,\n\n279\n00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.850\nthere's no 2016 version\nof SharePoint Designer.\n\n280\n00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:29.830\nBut the 2013 version of Designer,\n\n281\n00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:33.260\nwhich used to be FrontPage,\nwill still work with SharePoint 2016.\n\n282\n00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.610\nSo there's nothing extra you need to do.\n\n283\n00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:40.910\nYou can still work with SharePoint\nDesigner 2013 in your 2016 environment.\n\n284\n00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.820\nSo you can get more complex workflows.\n\n285\n00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.050\nAnd then for maximum complexities,\n\n286\n00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.580\nespecially if we're dealing\nwith a lot of databases\n\n287\n00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.670\nthen Visual Studio is the tool for you.\n\n288\n00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.150\n>> Very good.\n>> And so your, your devs would,\n\n289\n00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.270\nwould understand that, how to surface\ninformation in, in a web part, for\n\n290\n00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.870\nexample, in our digital dashboard\nidea we talked about sooner.\n\n291\n00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:02.060\nSo my point is, whatever you're doing\npaper-based now, or maybe some other\n\n292\n00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.570\nsoftware context, consider, at least,\nmoving that into a SharePoint.\n\n293\n00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.090\nContext, you could\neliminate several steps and\n\n294\n00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:12.560\ncertainly a lot of manual\npaper-based processes.\n\n295\n00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:18.530\nSo whatever length of time that\nworkflow normally took with sign offs,\n\n296\n00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.120\npaper, blah blah blah,\nnow you can considerably, often,\n\n297\n00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.900\nshorten that time and then have all\nthe reporting you need, auditing.\n\n298\n00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.510\nPeople kept in the loop like\na sales manager for example,\n\n299\n00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.800\nbeing notified when a new\nenquiry came in on our website.\n\n300\n00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.370\nSo, the sales manager gets an email.\n\n301\n00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.270\nOkay, this lead has been\nassigned to so-and-so.\n\n302\n00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.830\nAnd then maybe five days later,\n\n303\n00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.830\nthe sales manager gets prompted\nto follow up if he hasn't heard.\n\n304\n00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.670\nSo, you can automate these processes.\n\n305\n00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.360\nWhatever we can do let's face it.\n\n306\n00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.990\nWe're bombarded with information.\n\n307\n00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.070\nI think that the stat is we get more\ninformation in one day than our\n\n308\n00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.610\ngrandparent's did in\ntheir entire lifetime.\n\n309\n00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.314\n>> Wow. [LAUGH] >> Which is mind\nboggling when you think about it.\n\n310\n00:15:54.314 --> 00:15:55.745\n>> We have so many devices, right?\n\n311\n00:15:55.745 --> 00:15:56.245\n>> Yes.\n>> Right.\n\n312\n00:15:56.245 --> 00:15:59.536\nYour smartphones, tablets, computers.\n\n313\n00:15:59.536 --> 00:16:00.897\nSmart fridges, your car.\n\n314\n00:16:00.897 --> 00:16:01.719\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n315\n00:16:01.719 --> 00:16:03.485\n>> There's more computing power in\n\n316\n00:16:03.485 --> 00:16:04.619\nthe average car, for\n\n317\n00:16:04.619 --> 00:16:08.560\nyears this has been true, than\nthe technology that took man to the moon.\n\n318\n00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.060\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n319\n00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.290\n>> So the point is it's not a lack\n\n320\n00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:15.350\nof data we suffer from, it's\nan information overload in many cases.\n\n321\n00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:19.630\nSo how can we intelligently\nprocess that data and\n\n322\n00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.680\nbe notified about things\nthat we are interested in?\n\n323\n00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.465\nSo that's, again,\nSharePoint can help in that regard.\n\n324\n00:16:25.465 --> 00:16:31.570\nNow, where a lot of Microsoft\nresearch dollars are going,\n\n325\n00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:36.030\nin terms of SharePoint, is SharePoint\nOnline and Office 365, Office Server.\n\n326\n00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:40.630\nSo If you're familiar with\nthe interface for SharePoint 2013,\n\n327\n00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:45.980\nyou're not going to be shocked or\nsurprised by what's there in 2016.\n\n328\n00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.410\nAnd Microsoft has committed\nto keep releasing on-premises\n\n329\n00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.970\nversions of SharePoint.\n\n330\n00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.230\nSo, a lot of people get\nfreaked out thinking, my God,\n\n331\n00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:58.240\nwe have to move to the cloud right away,\nwe're gonna be left behind.\n\n332\n00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.470\nNo, that's not true and\nits compelling reasons for\n\n333\n00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.390\nkeeping at least some of\nyour data on premises.\n\n334\n00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.330\nNow, certain industries demand that and\n\n335\n00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:09.470\nI mean government,\nmaybe some finance, defense.\n\n336\n00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:15.100\nThere are other industries that may,\njust for\n\n337\n00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.160\nyour business rules or\nregulatory requirements.\n\n338\n00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.830\nYou may be required to keep\na certain amount of data on prem.\n\n339\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:24.490\nHowever, for the less critical information\nthat could be stored anywhere,\n\n340\n00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.480\nyou should at least be\ninvestigating the Cloud.\n\n341\n00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.650\nAnd that's in terms of SharePoint and\n\n342\n00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:31.800\nthat's where Microsoft's put a lot\nof their money in research dollars.\n\n343\n00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:37.990\nSo my point is, we'll be existing in\na hybrid world probably for some time.\n\n344\n00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.070\nSome companies do everything on-prem,\n\n345\n00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:44.830\nsome companies are all in the cloud now,\nthey have zero servers on-premises.\n\n346\n00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.940\nBut for most companies,\nwe'll have a combination of on-prem and\n\n347\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.850\ncloud based services and\nthere's flexibility too.\n\n348\n00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.130\nSo, you might try using a service\nin the Cloud and then realize,\n\n349\n00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.970\nno, we're not happy with\nthe management capability.\n\n350\n00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:00.170\nOr we're concerned about security here, so\n\n351\n00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:03.700\nwe're going to move that service\noffering back to on-premises.\n\n352\n00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.250\nSo you're not committed one way or\nthe other permanently,\n\n353\n00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.240\nyou can always have that flexibility.\n\n354\n00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.380\n>> That's nice to know.\n\n355\n00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.850\nVery good.\n>> Which is great!\n\n356\n00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:14.610\n>> Yes, so a lot of new things that\nwe can really do with SharePoint.\n\n357\n00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.528\nWhat else we have there, Mark?\n\n358\n00:18:17.528 --> 00:18:21.740\n>> Well so we talked about collaboration,\nthere are variety of\n\n359\n00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.480\ntemplates that Microsoft build\ninto SharePoint bake them in.\n\n360\n00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.300\nIn other word,\n\n361\n00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:30.100\nyou don't have to start from scratch every\ntime when you want to create a new site.\n\n362\n00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.380\nSo there's a template, let's say you're\ninterested in business intelligence,\n\n363\n00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.830\nthere's a template for that.\n\n364\n00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.940\nSo that is a huge, again,\nwe're awash with data.\n\n365\n00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.910\nHow can we make business\ndecisions from our data?\n\n366\n00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:42.880\nWell BI Tools,\n\n367\n00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.670\nlike SQL Server Reporting Services is\nbeautifully integrated with SharePoint.\n\n368\n00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.840\nSo people can go to a page and\n\n369\n00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.070\ngenerate reports or\nsee the reports displayed on the page.\n\n370\n00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:00.910\nAnd then, even click down into\nthe report and get drill down data and\n\n371\n00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.250\nview it in different formats.\n\n372\n00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.340\nLike numbers or pie charts or\nwhat have you, and see trends over time.\n\n373\n00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:11.760\nSo, the ability to display SQL Server\nreporting services in integrated\n\n374\n00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:17.870\nmode with share point is a compelling\nreason to use share point as well.\n\n375\n00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:23.240\nSo another template is the enterprise\nsearch center, again this is customizable.\n\n376\n00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.230\nSo my purpose in this\nsession here right now is,\n\n377\n00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:31.460\nto whet your appetite about what\nthings are possible with share point.\n\n378\n00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.910\nImagine if you could,\nfrom one screen, one search box,\n\n379\n00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:40.920\nsearch all these contents,\nvarious data sources, on prem.\n\n380\n00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.620\nMaybe in the cloud, competitors' websites,\nother data repositories, and\n\n381\n00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.080\nhave the results returned.\n\n382\n00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:53.000\nIt goes beyond that, you could even direct\ncertain queries to certain search engines.\n\n383\n00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.970\nSo you could say, if this word or phrase\nappears in the search query you use.\n\n384\n00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:05.320\nGoogle or Yahoo or maybe a custom\nLexus Nexus legal database for\n\n385\n00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.760\nexample if a certain term\nappears in the search field.\n\n386\n00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.740\nSo in terms of results return,\n\n387\n00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:17.920\nyou could say some of quadrant are for\n2x2 screen.\n\n388\n00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.180\nAnd then, results can appear from\ndifferent search engines on a very\n\n389\n00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.280\nsame page.\n\n390\n00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.900\nOrganize by search engine,\nthatâs pretty cool.\n\n391\n00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:25.780\n>> Thatâs impressive.\n\n392\n00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.030\n>> Yeah and\nthen you might wants to customize your,\n\n393\n00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.860\nanything you share was customizable.\n\n394\n00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.650\nThe beauty is, well see you later when\nit customize your search center screen.\n\n395\n00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:37.080\nOr the results page or\nlet's talk about the search itself.\n\n396\n00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.590\nSo you might want to have a field,\n\n397\n00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:43.780\na special field inserted like patient\nnumber or customer ID, or employee number.\n\n398\n00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:48.642\nSo, that is a special field\nthat you can search on.\n\n399\n00:20:48.642 --> 00:20:52.590\nSo, whatever makes sense for\nyour customers or employees,\n\n400\n00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:58.350\nyou can customize that search pane.\n\n401\n00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:02.800\n>> And I don't know about you guys out\nthere, you've got my mouth drooling here.\n\n402\n00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.520\nIt's about whetting our appetite for\n\n403\n00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.790\nwhat we can do with SharePoint,\na lot of great features.\n\n404\n00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.540\nAnything else we need to cover,\nMark, in this particular episode?\n\n405\n00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.950\n>> Yeah, yeah, so\nthere's various deployment options.\n\n406\n00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:16.850\nSo I mentioned earlier, that in the old\ndays, very inflexible architecture.\n\n407\n00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:18.320\nIn other words, once we set it up,\n\n408\n00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:23.070\nwe basically had to start over if we\nwanted to make any changes to the farm.\n\n409\n00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.240\nWhen we say SharePoint farm,\n\n410\n00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:29.160\nwe mean our entire SharePoint deployment,\nwhich could be as little as one server.\n\n411\n00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.450\nNow, that would only make\nsense in a test environment or\n\n412\n00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:32.950\nif you're a really small company.\n\n413\n00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.860\nYou at least want to have\nSQL Server on it's own box.\n\n414\n00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.720\n>> Performance reasons or\njust security reasons or both?\n\n415\n00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.290\n>> Both.\n\n416\n00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:41.890\n>> Yeah.\n>> But especially performance,\n\n417\n00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:46.775\nso it's kind of like highways and\ncars, right.\n\n418\n00:21:46.775 --> 00:21:48.435\nIn terms of hardware and software.\n\n419\n00:21:48.435 --> 00:21:51.705\nHardware gets faster, cheaper and\nthen the software developers think,\n\n420\n00:21:51.705 --> 00:21:53.825\nwow we've got all this extra capacity now.\n\n421\n00:21:53.825 --> 00:21:56.305\nLet's design a software that takes\nadvantage of this new hardware,\n\n422\n00:21:56.305 --> 00:21:58.433\nit's similar to building another highway.\n\n423\n00:21:58.433 --> 00:22:00.645\nGreat we're going to ease traffic now.\n\n424\n00:22:00.645 --> 00:22:04.795\nWell what often happens is, development\nskyrockets because people realize, okay,\n\n425\n00:22:04.795 --> 00:22:06.870\nmy commute time would only be an hour.\n\n426\n00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:10.350\nIf I'm going to this community,\nwhich right now is all trees, so\n\n427\n00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:12.700\nthen all these developments spring up and\nthe lanes get clogged.\n\n428\n00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.720\nSo, it's a similar battle\nwith hardware and software.\n\n429\n00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:19.470\nSo my point is, you're not going to\nget great performance by loading\n\n430\n00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.590\neverything SharePoint\nrelated on to one box.\n\n431\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:26.650\nBut if it's just a test environment,\nthen what the heck, you can do that and\n\n432\n00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:30.570\nbut at least you're going to\nwant to have a separate block.\n\n433\n00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.340\nWhen I say blocks it could be a VM or\n\n434\n00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:36.470\nphysical server or everything SharePoint\nrelated and then separate SQL backend.\n\n435\n00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.670\nNow, there's reasons you may want\nto separate out into tiers and\n\n436\n00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:43.230\nhave multiple servers and\nwe'll show you this later in the week.\n\n437\n00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.360\nMultiple servers as part of\nyour SharePoint deployment, for\n\n438\n00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.650\nexample application servers.\n\n439\n00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:52.120\nWeb front end servers,this is what\nthe client machines connect into and\n\n440\n00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.830\nthen the web front end\nservers relay requests.\n\n441\n00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.970\nOn behalf of the client machines to\nthe SQL server in the back end or\n\n442\n00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.850\nthe application server and\nreturn results to those client machines.\n\n443\n00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:07.530\nSo as always, more is more,\nyou want redundancy at each tier\n\n444\n00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:12.790\nif you can afford it and\nthat will give you better performance.\n\n445\n00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:13.930\nAnother neat thing that's new,\n\n446\n00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:17.710\nbecause we're talking about what's\nnew in SharePoint 2016 here as well.\n\n447\n00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:21.840\nNot just SharePoint in general,\nis this concept of zero down time.\n\n448\n00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.650\nSo, if you think back to SQL Slammer Worm,\nand\n\n449\n00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:28.230\nthe big reason why that wasn't deployed.\n\n450\n00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.770\nEven months even after\na known patch was released,\n\n451\n00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:35.670\nhis companies were afraid or\nreluctant to reboot their sequel servers.\n\n452\n00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.400\nA, they weren't sure if they\nwere going to come back up and\n\n453\n00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.610\nB, downtime would have cost them money.\n\n454\n00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:45.100\nSo now the idea is, since then by the way,\n\n455\n00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.320\nMicrosoft has made great strides and\ndone great work.\n\n456\n00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.140\nIn reducing the number of\nactivities that require a reboot.\n\n457\n00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.170\n>> Yes they have.\n\n458\n00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:55.300\n>> Sometimes you can even install\na service pack without rebooting,\n\n459\n00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.310\nthat really shocked me,\nthe first time I did that.\n\n460\n00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.430\nBecause of all the activities\nyou'd expect to require a reboot,\n\n461\n00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:02.600\nservice pack installation\nwould be one of those.\n\n462\n00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.210\nBut my point is now, and it's,\n\n463\n00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:10.460\nif you have redundancy of the different\ntiers, you can have zero downtime.\n\n464\n00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.760\nBecause they manage whatever\nreboots are necessary to\n\n465\n00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.590\nkeep service availability high.\n\n466\n00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.590\nAnd that's very important,\nbecause if you've got a website and\n\n467\n00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.260\nyou're making sales,\nmillions of dollars a year.\n\n468\n00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.890\nYou can't afford to have a customer\nshow up at your website and\n\n469\n00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:24.750\nget some kind of error.\n\n470\n00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.270\nThey will just go shop at a competitor or\nat the very least,\n\n471\n00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.990\nyour reputation will be tarnished.\n\n472\n00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:33.080\nEither they're growing too fast or they're\njust clueless, people are impatient,\n\n473\n00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.380\nthey will just buy from the competitor.\n\n474\n00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.800\nSo zero downtime is a beautiful thing.\n\n475\n00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.370\n>> All right, Mark,\nA lot of great features and\n\n476\n00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.100\nthen there's still more new features,\nright?\n\n477\n00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.200\nThat Javin told us about?\n\n478\n00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:43.800\n>> Indeed.\n\n479\n00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:49.650\nSo Office Graph is one of my favorite\ntechnologies, from that we have Delve.\n\n480\n00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:51.230\nSo what this does is,\n\n481\n00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:55.250\nit looks at all the documents you've\nworked on and your interactions.\n\n482\n00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.350\nAnd it will service information\nthat it thinks is relevant to you.\n\n483\n00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:02.220\nFor example,\nbased on if it's your boss and\n\n484\n00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.980\nit's a document you're\nboth collaborating on.\n\n485\n00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.740\nThat is an obvious indication that you're\ngoing to want to see that prominently,\n\n486\n00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.060\nif there has been a change made.\n\n487\n00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:12.160\nSo it looks at all your social\ninteractions, maybe your likes, or\n\n488\n00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.930\nratings, you might have\nrated some content.\n\n489\n00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.960\nAnd again, documents you've worked on and\nuses some machine learning,\n\n490\n00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.190\nas well,\nto expose content that's relevant to you.\n\n491\n00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.550\nAgain, another way to,\nrather than you looking for content,\n\n492\n00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:30.490\ncontent comes to you and\nkeeps you in the loop.\n\n493\n00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:33.106\n>> Skynet,\ncoming to us through SharePoint [LAUGH]\n\n494\n00:25:33.106 --> 00:25:33.640\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n495\n00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.320\n>> All right, Mark,\n\n496\n00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.430\nwell a lot of great information there,\nwe thank you for that.\n\n497\n00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:37.710\nI know you've whetted our appetites,\n\n498\n00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:41.310\nhopefully yours out there as well,\nabout aome of the capabilities.\n\n499\n00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:44.210\nAnd things that we're going to be able\nto accomplish with SharePoint and\n\n500\n00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.420\nthroughout the week,\nwe're gonna expand on those.\n\n501\n00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.920\nDo some demos for you and\nshow you how to get this up and running.\n\n502\n00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.450\nAs well as, help you prepare for that exam\nso that you can get SharePoint certifies.\n\n503\n00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:54.840\nSo we thank you for that, Mark.\n\n504\n00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.800\nEverybody out there we\nhope you enjoyed watching.\n\n505\n00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.060\nSigning off for IT Pro TV.\n\n506\n00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:58.990\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n507\n00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:00.600\n>> And

00:00:17.570\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.882\nToday we're doing our SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:23.933\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're continuing our thought processes on\n\n6\n00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:27.810\ndesigning our infrastructure, right,\nplanning to install SharePoint.\n\n7\n00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.320\nBecause we've already said that\nit's a very important part.\n\n8\n00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.950\nSharePoint's very complex, has a lot\nof pieces and a lot of capabilities.\n\n9\n00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.718\nAnd, odds are, your needs are not going\nto include every single one of those.\n\n10\n00:00:38.718 --> 00:00:42.810\nSo we gotta think about what it is\nwe're gonna do with SharePoint, and\n\n11\n00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.270\nhow we're going to set it up to support\nwhat we need to do with that information.\n\n12\n00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.330\nAnd so that means storing it within\nSharePoint in a way we can find it.\n\n13\n00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.440\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n14\n00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.560\nHow's it going, Mark?\n\n15\n00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.150\n>> Good, Mike, thanks very much.\n\n16\n00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.010\nYeah, so\nlet's talk about information architecture.\n\n17\n00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.828\nYou'll find that there's two things that\nmake a huge difference with the success\n\n18\n00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:05.927\nof your SharePoint deployment,\none is budgeting and planning for\n\n19\n00:01:05.927 --> 00:01:08.390\nend user training, right in the get-go.\n\n20\n00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.396\nThe other is planning successfully.\n\n21\n00:01:10.396 --> 00:01:13.342\nIf you don't plan, you plan to fail.\n\n22\n00:01:13.342 --> 00:01:17.240\nSo there's a lot of ad-hoc\nenvironments out there,\n\n23\n00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.610\nin terms of information architecture.\n\n24\n00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.120\nIn other words,\nno one's really thought it through.\n\n25\n00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.309\nOr maybe if they have thought it through,\nbut there's a merger acquisition,\n\n26\n00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:25.385\nsometimes more than one.\n\n27\n00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:29.420\nAnd then you've got a hodgepodge of\ndisparate information architectures.\n\n28\n00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.550\nSo, my purpose, for\nthe next few minutes is to\n\n29\n00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.620\nsell you on the idea of the importance\nof information architecture.\n\n30\n00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.960\nSo in the old days, we used to sell or\n\n31\n00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.050\nattempt to sell technology to businesses\njust because we had the latest version.\n\n32\n00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.616\n>> Absolutely.\n\n33\n00:01:46.616 --> 00:01:49.100\n>> There's no thought to it, I mean,\nof course you should have it.\n\n34\n00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.740\nWe just spent a year and a half creating\nthis new version, Mr. Customer.\n\n35\n00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.990\nYou should upgrade,\nwithout regard to any kind of\n\n36\n00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.230\nbusiness requirement that really would\nmake a difference to the customer.\n\n37\n00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.290\nIn other words, what's in it for them?\n\n38\n00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.120\nThey wanna know, and\nthat's a reasonable question.\n\n39\n00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.660\nSo thankfully for years now we've been\nmuch more on the side of business.\n\n40\n00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.710\nSure, pitch a technology, but\n\n41\n00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.300\nonly if there's a compelling business\nreason that the customer should deploy it.\n\n42\n00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.860\nDon't just pitch it just\nbecause you have it.\n\n43\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.710\nWhat problems are we solving?\n\n44\n00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.730\nSo, we need to understand\nthe business requirements.\n\n45\n00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.930\nWhy are they using SharePoint?\n\n46\n00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.457\nAnd remember, SharePoint can\ndo a lot of different things.\n\n47\n00:02:26.457 --> 00:02:31.110\nBut in almost every case, you're gonna\nbe dealing with manipulating, modifying,\n\n48\n00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.708\nsaving, storing, retrieving information.\n\n49\n00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:39.400\nHow can we categorize information\nto make it easily findable?\n\n50\n00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.260\nSo studies have shown users can spend 10\nto 40% or more of their time just looking\n\n51\n00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.680\nfor information, like we talked about in\nanother episode, so, what a waste of time.\n\n52\n00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.525\nSo what I'm saying is, if we spend the\ntime to properly classify our information,\n\n53\n00:02:55.525 --> 00:02:58.708\nin other words,\nset up an architecture, a taxonomy,\n\n54\n00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:00.944\nwe'll define that a little later on.\n\n55\n00:03:00.944 --> 00:03:05.270\nIf we spend that time up front,\nwe're gonna reap great benefits.\n\n56\n00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.860\nUsers will be able to find the documents,\nfor example, they're looking for\n\n57\n00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.740\nmuch easier.\n\n58\n00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.830\nSo we've got site columns and\ncontent types and term sets we'll discuss.\n\n59\n00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.610\nSo what is a site column?\n\n60\n00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.000\nA site column holds a piece of\ninformation, a piece of metadata.\n\n61\n00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.980\nNow, what do we mean by metadata?\n\n62\n00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.335\nWell, the best definition I know of is,\nmetadata is data about data.\n\n63\n00:03:31.335 --> 00:03:32.410\n>> Yep.\n[LAUGH]\n\n64\n00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.810\n>> So let's say you've got a simple\n\n65\n00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.080\nWord document.\n\n66\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.720\nEven if you only have one\nletter in the Word document,\n\n67\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.300\nthere's still gonna be a bunch of\nmetadata associated with that document.\n\n68\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.890\nFor example, the author, the file size,\n\n69\n00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.310\nthe date the file was created,\nthe date the file was saved or modified.\n\n70\n00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.220\nSo it's information about the information.\n\n71\n00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.640\nDifferent file types will have different\nmetadata which makes sense to capture.\n\n72\n00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.730\nFor example, if it's a photo,\nthen focal length,\n\n73\n00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.010\nresolution, file size\nwill all be relevant.\n\n74\n00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.880\nSo some metadata terms or\n\n75\n00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.098\nsite columns only make sense when\ntalking about certain file types.\n\n76\n00:04:13.098 --> 00:04:13.640\nFor example,\n\n77\n00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.190\nthere's no image size relating to\na Word document, doesn't make sense.\n\n78\n00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.100\nSo, depending on the file type and\ndepending on the business reason for\n\n79\n00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.380\nthe information,\nwe're gonna capture different metadata.\n\n80\n00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.280\nSo, SharePoint is one of those\ntechnologies that to use properly,\n\n81\n00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.500\nyou require governance.\n\n82\n00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.476\nSo, a lot of what the success of\na SharePoint deployment comes in\n\n83\n00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:40.990\nthe planning stage, that's why we're\ntalking about it right up front.\n\n84\n00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.820\nIt's very easy as a dev or\n\n85\n00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.930\nan IT pro, even an end user,\npeople wanna get hands on right away.\n\n86\n00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.346\n>> Yes.\n>> Let's just get in there, and\n\n87\n00:04:49.346 --> 00:04:50.347\nwe'll figure it on the way.\n\n88\n00:04:50.347 --> 00:04:53.203\nAnd if we screw something up,\nwe'll fix it later.\n\n89\n00:04:53.203 --> 00:04:54.968\n>> I've had a boss like that.\n\n90\n00:04:54.968 --> 00:04:57.420\nHe was like, hey, we got this\nnew software, let's install it.\n\n91\n00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.020\nNo consideration as to what it might do\nto anything else running on the network.\n\n92\n00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.107\n>> Right.\n>> Lack of planning.\n\n93\n00:05:03.107 --> 00:05:04.802\n>> Install first, ask questions later.\n\n94\n00:05:04.802 --> 00:05:06.265\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not helpful.\n\n95\n00:05:06.265 --> 00:05:10.770\nSo today, in this episode we want to again\n\n96\n00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.910\nenroll you in the idea of proper planning.\n\n97\n00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.015\nThat comes from governance, and\nthat comes from C-level buy-in, so\n\n98\n00:05:19.015 --> 00:05:20.681\nyou need a champion for this project.\n\n99\n00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:23.835\nSo in terms of information or\narchitecture,\n\n100\n00:05:23.835 --> 00:05:26.740\ndifferent divisions of a company, say,\n\n101\n00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.969\nmight define what seems like the same\nterm or entity, like a customer, for\n\n102\n00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:37.625\nexample, or a patient, people might think\nthe customer, how hard could it be?\n\n103\n00:05:37.625 --> 00:05:41.293\nIt's a customer, maybe we got their name,\ntheir address, phone number,\n\n104\n00:05:41.293 --> 00:05:43.710\nmaybe the last time they\npurchased something.\n\n105\n00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.740\nHow hard could it be?\n\n106\n00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.030\nWell the point is,\nespecially with mergers or for\n\n107\n00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:53.020\nfinance, HR, sales, deployment,\ndifferent divisions\n\n108\n00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.260\nare gonna have a different\ninterest in the exact same entity.\n\n109\n00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.340\nFor example, if I'm a research scientist\ndoing a study on patients, I might have\n\n110\n00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.810\na case ID or a research patient ID\nnumber that only I'm interested in.\n\n111\n00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.470\nBut other kinds of information you want\nto capture pertains organization wide.\n\n112\n00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.370\nSo my point is we need\nto get people together.\n\n113\n00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.080\nThere was a Chinese chain,\na restaurant chain in the States and\n\n114\n00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.400\nit was a franchise situation,\nhundreds of stores.\n\n115\n00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.776\nAt one point the owner said, because\ndifferent people had different recipes for\n\n116\n00:06:27.776 --> 00:06:29.807\nthe exact same menu item,\nhe said you know what,\n\n117\n00:06:29.807 --> 00:06:32.061\nwe're gonna get these head\nchefs together in a room.\n\n118\n00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:35.540\nNobody leaves until you've standardized\non these eight menu items.\n\n119\n00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.068\nWhat is kung pao chicken,\nwhat goes into it?\n\n120\n00:06:38.068 --> 00:06:39.950\nHow big is the portion size?\n\n121\n00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.330\nWhat sauces are we using?\n\n122\n00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.100\nThat way when a customer goes\nto an outlet in Florida,\n\n123\n00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.720\nGeorgia, Washington,\nwherever, they're gonna get\n\n124\n00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.940\nthe same experience because we're\nmaking the food the exact same way.\n\n125\n00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.482\nThat's the same principle when it\ncomes to defining metadata columns or\n\n126\n00:06:56.482 --> 00:07:00.100\nsite columns pertaining\nto certain information.\n\n127\n00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.640\nSo, let's say with customer, we want,\n\n128\n00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.652\nmaybe we need their birth date and\nphysical location, so their address,\n\n129\n00:07:07.652 --> 00:07:11.660\nmaybe their shipping address, billing\naddress, and whatever else we need.\n\n130\n00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.356\nSo when I save,\nlet's say I get a new customer document,\n\n131\n00:07:15.356 --> 00:07:17.674\na new customer form, I fill it out.\n\n132\n00:07:17.674 --> 00:07:19.972\nI save it to, let's say,\n\n133\n00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:25.280\na SharePoint library I have\nto specify certain metadata.\n\n134\n00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.410\nNow some of this could be\nautomatically specified.\n\n135\n00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.860\nFor example, the name of the person\nsaving the customer for the first time,\n\n136\n00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.050\nthe customer information, that would\nbe me, the currently logged in user.\n\n137\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:41.639\nMaybe I have to attach also or associate a\nparticular salesperson with the customer.\n\n138\n00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.920\nOr what region is the customer in, is it\nnorth, south, east, west for example?\n\n139\n00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.010\nSo we can classify that customer.\n\n140\n00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.880\nSo, it gets managed appropriately,\nthat customer.\n\n141\n00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.533\nSo, some of the fields we enter\nMaybe we can type them in, but\n\n142\n00:07:58.533 --> 00:08:04.290\nit's better to choose from a restricted\nlist like a drop down menu.\n\n143\n00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.190\nSo when it comes time to\nenter the metadata or\n\n144\n00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:12.720\nenter the field of data for\nregion, they choose the drop down.\n\n145\n00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.490\nThey can only choose one,\nand then it's standardized.\n\n146\n00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.510\nSometimes we see problems with\ndifferent abbreviations for\n\n147\n00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.380\nstates, for example,\nespecially if there's a merger involved.\n\n148\n00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:28.330\nSo you might call Florida FLA is\nan abbreviation, I might call it FL.\n\n149\n00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.160\nIt refers to the same state.\n\n150\n00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.020\nCleaning up the data is\nanother conversation\n\n151\n00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.990\nwhich we can do with some of Microsoft's\ntools, but we'll leave that for now.\n\n152\n00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:41.140\nBut just know that I'm talking about\nthe importance of standardizing\n\n153\n00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:41.820\non definitions.\n\n154\n00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.880\n>> It's got to be an important part\nof when you're dealing with so\n\n155\n00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.760\nmuch information.\n\n156\n00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.130\nBeing able to make it consistent because\nif I'm going to search for something,\n\n157\n00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:54.020\nif I search for FLA, I only find half the\nrecords cuz I'm not gonna find the ones\n\n158\n00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.070\nwith FL, for example,\ndepending on of course how I do my search.\n\n159\n00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:02.508\nSo making that information, the metadata,\nthe data about the data, consistent, eases\n\n160\n00:09:02.508 --> 00:09:07.820\nor makes it much more successful when\nyou go to search for that information.\n\n161\n00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.640\n>> Absolutely, in fact, part of the making\nsearch better, so search is a whole\n\n162\n00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.020\nother topic, we'll certainly talk\na lot about search this week.\n\n163\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.100\nWe can help users by, let's say we\nhave not standardized data yet, or\n\n164\n00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.900\nwe're in the process of synchronizing or\n\n165\n00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.600\nstandardizing, FL versus\nFLA is a good example.\n\n166\n00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:33.030\nIn the meantime, we can define synonym so\nthat if I'm searching for FL,\n\n167\n00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:39.770\nI get results with customers from Florida\nwhen they're define as FL or even FLA.\n\n168\n00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.300\nSo that's a manual process, so I can make\nsure that the searchers also returning\n\n169\n00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.940\nall the information that\nwe originally searched on.\n\n170\n00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.430\nOkay, so let's talk taxonomy now.\n\n171\n00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:57.170\nSo taxonomy, to me, I always think of\nsome little fossilized bones in a museum,\n\n172\n00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:01.020\nbut there's different ways of\nclassifying plants, for example,\n\n173\n00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:06.035\nflora and fauna, animals with genuses,\ngeni, I'm not sure.\n\n174\n00:10:06.035 --> 00:10:08.861\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But our product catalog,\n\n175\n00:10:08.861 --> 00:10:11.540\na little closer to home.\n\n176\n00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.300\nLet's say I manufacture a car.\n\n177\n00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.430\nI'm a car manufacturer.\n\n178\n00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.055\nWell I'm gonna have model numbers.\n\n179\n00:10:17.055 --> 00:10:19.870\nThere'll be lots of part numbers.\n\n180\n00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:23.900\nThere's certain ways to best\nclassify those parts for example.\n\n181\n00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:29.780\nNuts and bolts, panels,\nit's a way of easily navigating to and\n\n182\n00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.880\nsearching through various\ninformation that we've classified.\n\n183\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.470\nAnother classification, the best ever in\nmy opinion, from over a hundred years ago,\n\n184\n00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.940\nit's stands the test of time,\nit's very durable, reliable,\n\n185\n00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.960\nis the Dewey Decimal System.\n\n186\n00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.440\nSo, over a hundred years old.\n\n187\n00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.370\nDewey had no idea about\nsome of the new technology\n\n188\n00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.850\nthat's been created if you think about\nall the changes in the last 100 years.\n\n189\n00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:55.550\nHowever, the system is\nrobust because it allows for\n\n190\n00:10:55.550 --> 00:11:01.305\nthe insertion of New learning, new\nknowledge, entirely new fields, but they\n\n191\n00:11:01.305 --> 00:11:05.485\nstill can be classified in the existing\n100s, 200s, 300s that he's set up.\n\n192\n00:11:05.485 --> 00:11:07.015\nSo if you've ever spent\ntime in a high school or\n\n193\n00:11:07.015 --> 00:11:11.335\ncollege library, maybe back in the day\nwhen the index cards I'm dating myself.\n\n194\n00:11:11.335 --> 00:11:12.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was before the Internet.\n\n195\n00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:16.010\nBut you had to flip through the cards,\nthen go to a certain book stack.\n\n196\n00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.471\n>> I remember those days.\n\n197\n00:11:17.471 --> 00:11:18.592\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Track the book.\n\n198\n00:11:18.592 --> 00:11:20.193\nHopefully, no one had hidden the book.\n\n199\n00:11:20.193 --> 00:11:21.160\n>> Yeah, right?\n[LAUGH]\n\n200\n00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.660\n>> So anyway.\n\n201\n00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.180\n>> That's the one\n\n202\n00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.060\nyou need for exams.\n\n203\n00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:23.930\n>> Exactly.\n>> Never there.\n\n204\n00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:24.625\n>> Son of a gun.\n\n205\n00:11:24.625 --> 00:11:26.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyway, the Dewey Decimal System.\n\n206\n00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:31.048\nSo you, in your organization, your\ncustomers' organizations, need a taxonomy.\n\n207\n00:11:31.048 --> 00:11:37.680\nSo, again,\nit's not a hands on part design taxonomy.\n\n208\n00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.620\nYou come up with the site columns,\nthe metadata that's of interest for\n\n209\n00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.750\nyou to capture.\n\n210\n00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:48.220\nSome of the metadata columns or site\ncolumns would contain mandatory fields.\n\n211\n00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.420\nYou define them as mandatory.\n\n212\n00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:54.201\nFor example, customer address,\nsales rep assigned to the customer,\n\n213\n00:11:54.201 --> 00:11:56.450\nregion the customer's in.\n\n214\n00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:00.430\nWhereas other site columns,\nwe might define as optional.\n\n215\n00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.360\nIn other words, it's a nice information to\nhave, but it's not absolutely required.\n\n216\n00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.910\nEven the mandatory columns\nthough may not require\n\n217\n00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:11.230\na manual choice from the user when\nthey save a document for example.\n\n218\n00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:16.950\nIn other words, we could automatically\ncalculate or populate that value for them.\n\n219\n00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.500\nSo what kinds of information can\nbe included in site columns?\n\n220\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.170\nAnything you can dream up.\n\n221\n00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.760\nIt could be a number, a date, a time.\n\n222\n00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.140\nIt could reference\na lookup to another field.\n\n223\n00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.790\nSo a product ID number, for\nexample, or sales person ID.\n\n224\n00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.379\nIt could be a calculated column.\n\n225\n00:12:34.418 --> 00:12:37.460\nSo really you're only limited\nby your imagination in terms of\n\n226\n00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.170\nwhat metadata you want to capture.\n\n227\n00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.410\nWhy do we capture it?\n\n228\n00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:45.180\nBecause we can do so\nmuch more with, in terms of\n\n229\n00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:50.020\neasily find that information, and also we\ncan use what they called ContentType, and\n\n230\n00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.320\nwe'll certainly demoing\nthis throughout the week.\n\n231\n00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.270\nSo a ContentType is a unique\ngrouping of columns.\n\n232\n00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.400\nAnd then we can use the ContentType\nto classify information snd take\n\n233\n00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.680\naction on information of\na certain ContentType.\n\n234\n00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.390\nFor example, we might have\nthe information archival policy.\n\n235\n00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:12.500\nSo, we're saying if it's ContentType A,\nany content at all that\n\n236\n00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.170\nis defined as ContentType A,\nwe have new information retention policy.\n\n237\n00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.060\nSo let's say two years after,\n\n238\n00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.330\nthe last person has accessed\nanything to do with ContentType A,\n\n239\n00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.140\nwe're gonna archive that content to\nkeep it off our production server.\n\n240\n00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.190\nSo, a little more offline,\nnear line if you like.\n\n241\n00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:31.270\nAnd that's a way of classifying.\n\n242\n00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:36.060\nWe can also dispose of information\nx years after content creation\n\n243\n00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.520\nbased on content type.\n\n244\n00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.635\nWe could also have a SearchScope.\n\n245\n00:13:39.635 --> 00:13:43.780\nIn other words, I wanna return\nsearch results for this phrase but\n\n246\n00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.960\nonly return results\nrelating to ContentType A.\n\n247\n00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:53.510\nSo there's all kinds of great reasons to\ncome up with standardized definitions for\n\n248\n00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:57.905\nsite columns and then collect them\ntogether in various ContentTypes.\n\n249\n00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:05.208\nOkay, so in terms of information\ndesign and search, so\n\n250\n00:14:05.208 --> 00:14:13.350\nthere's an information, there's a master's\nyou can get in information management.\n\n251\n00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.620\nWhich is extremely important\nnowadays because often\n\n252\n00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.620\nit's missing from our education in IT,\nbut some of these people are expert at\n\n253\n00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:26.130\nknowing how to classify\ninformation to make it findable.\n\n254\n00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.910\nHaving said that, there's still\na lot of manual processes involved.\n\n255\n00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:33.220\nSo in other words, you might have\na trademark name for a certain synthetic\n\n256\n00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:39.920\nfabric if you make overcoats, for example,\nbut then you change the brand name,\n\n257\n00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.210\nbut you want to include search results\nusing the new term and the old term.\n\n258\n00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:48.130\nWell, you could then manually define\nsynonyms, so when someone searched for\n\n259\n00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:51.960\nthe old term, what they get back\nare results including the old term and\n\n260\n00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.680\nthe new term.\n\n261\n00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.890\n>> That's gonna be a great feature.\n\n262\n00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.120\nEspecially when you've got\ndifferent classifications or\n\n263\n00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.490\nthe classification system maybe\nwasn't in place in the beginning.\n\n264\n00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.350\nOr as you talked about with some mergers\nand things where we've got things\n\n265\n00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.920\nthat might be classified slightly\ndifferently meaning the same things.\n\n266\n00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.870\nWe can slowly transition\nto that new system but\n\n267\n00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:11.360\nin the meantime, still get all\nthe results we need using those synonyms.\n\n268\n00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:11.980\n>> Exactly.\n\n269\n00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.750\n>> Exactly.\n\n270\n00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.830\n>> We could also use promoted results.\n\n271\n00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:18.310\nSo we can say if someone searches for\nthis word or phrase,\n\n272\n00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:23.220\nwe're going to bump that result\nup in the search results.\n\n273\n00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.240\nAnd if you think of Google, for example,\nor other search technologies, Bing,\n\n274\n00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.160\npeople generally don't scan beyond\nthe first one or two pages.\n\n275\n00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.300\nSo by promoting a result,\nwe're saying okay, people,\n\n276\n00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.220\nno matter what they search for, this\nword or phrase, they probably want this.\n\n277\n00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.130\nBecause it's a popular document,\nit's been rated highly.\n\n278\n00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.964\nAnd or maybe we're getting calls\nI can't find this document.\n\n279\n00:15:42.964 --> 00:15:47.940\nSo we can, but again, it requires some\ninformation architect point of view even\n\n280\n00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:53.210\na librarian kind of mindset to help people\nfind what it is they're looking for.\n\n281\n00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:57.870\nEven if they don't know exactly\nthe term Or what search term to use.\n\n282\n00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:03.699\nSo we'll talk about search lot this week\nand one of the ways to improve search\n\n283\n00:16:03.699 --> 00:16:09.690\nresults for users is to run a report\non queries that produced no results.\n\n284\n00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:13.840\nUnless it's an obvious thing like a typo,\npeople were searching for something.\n\n285\n00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.700\nSo, what were they searching for\nthat got no results?\n\n286\n00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:21.440\nMaybe we need to add some keywords or\nsynonyms, or again, some manual process.\n\n287\n00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.790\nSo, when they search for this term, or\nthis phrase, we'll give them this result.\n\n288\n00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.070\nBecause we think that's actually\nwhat they're looking for.\n\n289\n00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.659\nSo, we wanna make things easier and\nget better results for our users.\n\n290\n00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.630\nWe also have this concept of term sets.\n\n291\n00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:42.410\nSo maybe we have 50 products and\nwe want to use certain terms\n\n292\n00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:46.630\nto refer to the products, maybe product\nname, or some element of that product.\n\n293\n00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.380\nSo, let's say there's a drop down menu.\n\n294\n00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.560\nThen we can restrict meta data entry,\nfor example.\n\n295\n00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.160\nI'll give you the example of four\ndifferent regions north, south,\n\n296\n00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.120\neast, west.\n\n297\n00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.630\nMaybe we have eight different\nkinds of jackets and peopl,e\n\n298\n00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.840\nwhen they're saving a document, they have\nto define one of those eight options.\n\n299\n00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.410\nSo, we can define the terms.\n\n300\n00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:10.150\nSo, sometimes we need the write\nin options, assume a blank field,\n\n301\n00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:11.060\na text field.\n\n302\n00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.060\nOther times we want to restrict entry.\n\n303\n00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:18.080\nAnd we can do that with what are called\nterm sets, which are collections of one or\n\n304\n00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.200\nmore terms.\n\n305\n00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.180\nAnd we'll be showing you that\nlater this week as well.\n\n306\n00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.230\n>> Very nice.\n\n307\n00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.730\n>> Okay.\n\n308\n00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:29.410\nSo again, to get buy-in for SharePoint,\n\n309\n00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.620\nwe're asking users to do\nthings a different way.\n\n310\n00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.880\nMaybe they're used to searching\nthrough various file servers or\n\n311\n00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.720\ndifferent data stores.\n\n312\n00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.620\nIn a different episode,\nwe talked about search capabilities and\n\n313\n00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:44.660\nhow we can use SharePoint to search\nacross a huge variety of data sources,\n\n314\n00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.750\nno matter where that data lives.\n\n315\n00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.150\nCould be in the cloud.\n\n316\n00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:52.650\nCould be file servers, exchange public\nfolders, any organized data source,\n\n317\n00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:54.800\nSQL databases, other databases.\n\n318\n00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:59.540\nWe can search and have the results show\nup in one place in our search results.\n\n319\n00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.961\nSo, that is a beautiful thing.\n\n320\n00:18:02.961 --> 00:18:03.529\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n321\n00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:08.520\n>> And again, by defining and\n\n322\n00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.020\nstandardizing on definitions of\nvarious entities, like customer,\n\n323\n00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:17.110\nsupplier, employee,\nit's gonna ultimately make life easier.\n\n324\n00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:22.320\nIt might take a little longer to\nsave documents, for example, but\n\n325\n00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.430\nthe payoff is it'll be much easier\nto navigate to those documents,\n\n326\n00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:31.050\nto find them and, or\nwork to search for those documents.\n\n327\n00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.800\nSo, again, little pain up front.\n\n328\n00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.220\nThere could be some arguments\nof standardizing definitions but\n\n329\n00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.390\nit's worth it in the end for find-ability.\n\n330\n00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:44.600\nAlso, you're not restricted\nto these enterprise wide,\n\n331\n00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.590\nor farm wide,\ndefinitions of a particular entity.\n\n332\n00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.710\nSo in other words,\nlet's say I'm in a research group.\n\n333\n00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:55.610\nThere's only five of us, we have our\nown site collection, team sites.\n\n334\n00:18:55.610 --> 00:19:00.560\nThere may be meta data columns I need to\ncapture that make no difference whatsoever\n\n335\n00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.250\nto anyone else in the organization,\nlike research subject ID for example.\n\n336\n00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.680\nMaybe funding source for\na particular drug trial, for\n\n337\n00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:14.130\nexample, that it's really only\nrelevant to my particular department.\n\n338\n00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:18.670\nSo, rather than cluttering up\nmetadata options enterprise wide,\n\n339\n00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:23.020\nI'm gonna restrict those metadata options,\nsite column choices,\n\n340\n00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.590\nto just my department,\njust my site collection.\n\n341\n00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:31.390\nSo you have that individual flexibility\nin how you define additional columns\n\n342\n00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:35.780\nthat are only relevant for\na subset of the enterprise.\n\n343\n00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.630\n>> That's fantastic because that can\nbe challenging is trying to make\n\n344\n00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.330\nthings work across\nthe entire enterprise when\n\n345\n00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.600\neach department might do things\na little bit differently.\n\n346\n00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.330\nAnd, as you said, some information is\nreally important to one department but\n\n347\n00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:48.830\nirrelevant to another department,\n\n348\n00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.410\nand yet, it shows up because that's\njust the way the data was tagged.\n\n349\n00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.560\nSo now we can filter that out or\n\n350\n00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.480\nmake it show just the relevant\ninformation to me and my department.\n\n351\n00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.840\n>> True, another great thing is,\nand this has been true since 2013,\n\n352\n00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.430\nis the ability to standardize with\na special kind of site collection\n\n353\n00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:11.260\nat the farm level on these definitions\nof columns and metadata, and\n\n354\n00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.510\nhave what are called\nconsuming site collections.\n\n355\n00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:18.670\nIn other words, we define this site\ncolumn at the enterprise level.\n\n356\n00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:23.700\nOther site collections consume or\nutilize that definition of a site column.\n\n357\n00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:28.030\nLet's say, maybe there's some regulation\nor business decision made, that we need to\n\n358\n00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:33.880\nmodify a content type, or modify a site\ncolumn slightly at the enterprise level,\n\n359\n00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.340\nto capture a different kind\nof information, for example.\n\n360\n00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:41.290\nWe can change that site column\ndefinition once at the enterprise,\n\n361\n00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:46.290\nor farm level, and all the consuming\nsite collections that are leveraging\n\n362\n00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:52.000\nthat same definition of a column,\nwill automatically get the change.\n\n363\n00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.030\nOtherwise, we might have to make\na change 50 times across enterprise,\n\n364\n00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:59.380\nwhich would be a disaster to try and\nsynchronize that.\n\n365\n00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.630\nSo with this managed metadata service,\nwe can synchronize these enterprise wide\n\n366\n00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:09.340\ncolumns, auto-magically making simply\none change at the enterprise level.\n\n367\n00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.510\n>> Mark again a lot of great\ninformation there on planning,\n\n368\n00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.210\ndeploying our SharePoint.\n\n369\n00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:19.490\nThings that we've gotta think about before\nwe ever put that disk in the CD, or\n\n370\n00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.335\nman up that ISO and\nstart installing thing and playing around.\n\n371\n00:21:22.335 --> 00:21:26.810\nBecause a good, successful plan is gonna\nlead to a good, successful deployment.\n\n372\n00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:30.380\nAnd hopefully something that your end\nusers will end up actually using,\n\n373\n00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:34.010\nwhich is, I'm sure, the deal to make\ngoals, so we appreciate that Mark.\n\n374\n00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.090\nI hope everyone out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n375\n00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.610\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n376\n00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:39.270\n>> And I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n377\n00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:43.085\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n378\n00:21:43.085 --> 00:21:48.310\n>> [NOISE]\n\n",

00:00:20.228\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing our SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:22.352\nAnd more specifically, in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:24.831\nwe're continuing on with\nour planning process.\n\n6\n00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:26.570\nWe've stressed to you a few times,\n\n7\n00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.390\nMark has, how important this part of\nsuccessfully deploying SharePoint is.\n\n8\n00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.050\nSo we're continuing on with our planning.\n\n9\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.430\nWe're gonna dive into the logical\narchitecture of our SharePoint solution.\n\n10\n00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.710\nSo here to help us, of course,\nis Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n11\n00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.587\nHow's it going Mark?\n\n12\n00:00:40.587 --> 00:00:41.630\n>> Great, thanks Mike.\n\n13\n00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.750\nAll right continuing on, so as we say, for\n\n14\n00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.950\nthose of you that don't think planning\nis important or you can't get buy in.\n\n15\n00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.930\nMaybe business units have said,\nhere IT, SharePoint,\n\n16\n00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.470\nwe just paid a lot of money for\nthis license.\n\n17\n00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.195\nYou deploy it.\n\n18\n00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:56.930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What could possibly go wrong?\n\n19\n00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.730\nWell, a lot, so we could say,\nif you don't have time to plan,\n\n20\n00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.110\nwhat you're saying is you have\ntime to plan later, after failure.\n\n21\n00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.330\nWhich invariably takes longer, and\nthen SharePoint gets a bad rep,\n\n22\n00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.040\nbecause it didn't work when\nyou installed the software.\n\n23\n00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.380\nThat's not the design of it.\n\n24\n00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.150\nSo I'm encouraging you strongly to\ngather stakeholders together, and\n\n25\n00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.120\nto do that, you're gonna need\nsome executive-level buy in.\n\n26\n00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.090\nSomebody to the champion the project and\nto see it through when perhaps\n\n27\n00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.640\ncompeting priorities start poking up and\nsay, we need attention, we need attention.\n\n28\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.430\nWell this is an important project and\nthe more care and time and effort to\n\n29\n00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.600\nget the results in the planning stage, the\nbetter your SharePoint deployment will be.\n\n30\n00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.258\nIncluding for elements of SharePoint,\nthat you're not deploying right away, but\n\n31\n00:01:42.258 --> 00:01:43.760\nthat you're gonna deploy later.\n\n32\n00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.170\nThe planning,\nthe foundation is extremely important.\n\n33\n00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.430\nNot that you can't change things later but\nit's much better to start fresh.\n\n34\n00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.400\nBy the way, what we're talking about\nin this segment applies equally for\n\n35\n00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.810\nthose of you who are upgrading SharePoint.\n\n36\n00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.640\nNow, there's no direct upgrade path\nfrom SharePoint 2010 or earlier, but\n\n37\n00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.230\nfrom SharePoint 2013,\nno problem to upgrade.\n\n38\n00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.390\nWe'll look at a couple of methods for\nthat this week.\n\n39\n00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.410\nSome people skip a major\nversion before upgrading,\n\n40\n00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.130\nso maybe you're still\nrunning SharePoint 2010.\n\n41\n00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.870\nIn that case, you're gonna have to\ndo two upgrades to get to 2016,\n\n42\n00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.600\nunless you look at a third-party tool.\n\n43\n00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.990\nBut natively you're gonna have to go\nfrom 2010 to 2013 and then to 2016.\n\n44\n00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.860\nBut the good news about this discussion\nis the principles still apply.\n\n45\n00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.320\nSo there's some common elements\nto any SharePoint upgrade about\n\n46\n00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.558\nthings like customization\nprobably won't work.\n\n47\n00:02:37.558 --> 00:02:42.710\nSo you'd wanna revert to a vanilla\ninstallation of SharePoint or at least\n\n48\n00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.860\nbe planning and coding and designing your\napplications for the new 2016 environment.\n\n49\n00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.530\nSo again,\nthere's different ways you can go.\n\n50\n00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.950\nIn terms of upgrading, you can do it\nall at once on the same hardware,\n\n51\n00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.350\nwhich is fast, but potentially risky,\ncuz you're eliminating rollback potential.\n\n52\n00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.210\nAnother way to go is to do side by\nsides so your running concurrently, say\n\n53\n00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.460\nSharePoint 2013 and your new SharePoint\n2016, preferably on new hardware,\n\n54\n00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.175\nbecause I don't think there's a version of\nany software that required less resources.\n\n55\n00:03:13.175 --> 00:03:13.914\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n56\n00:03:13.914 --> 00:03:15.870\n>> Right, so-\n>> Except for maybe Vista to Windows 7,\n\n57\n00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:16.994\nthat might be one [LAUGH].\n\n58\n00:03:16.994 --> 00:03:18.097\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n59\n00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:19.049\nGood point.\n\n60\n00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.200\nWe don't talk about Vista.\n\n61\n00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.370\n>> That's right, we forget about that one.\n\n62\n00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.345\n>> It's a four letter word,\neven though it's actually five.\n\n63\n00:03:23.345 --> 00:03:26.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it got us to Windows 7,\n\n64\n00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.780\njust like Windows 8,\n8.1 got us to Windows 10.\n\n65\n00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.631\nSo we work with what we got, all right.\n\n66\n00:03:35.631 --> 00:03:36.381\nBy the way,\n\n67\n00:03:36.381 --> 00:03:41.340\nwe're gonna talk about physical design\nconsiderations in an upcoming show.\n\n68\n00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.471\nAnd some of the concepts arguably you\ncould say are logical and/or physical,\n\n69\n00:03:46.471 --> 00:03:49.150\nso we're not gonna be totally rigid.\n\n70\n00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.150\nI'll throw in some physical concepts\nrelated to upgrading and deploying,\n\n71\n00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.760\nand when we get to that show\nI'll probably refer back\n\n72\n00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.140\nto some of the logical concepts.\n\n73\n00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.230\nSo the point is there's\nlogical elements to plan and\n\n74\n00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.912\nphysical elements to plan as well.\n\n75\n00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:13.830\nAnd again, if you avoid doing that\nplanning, you do so at your own risk.\n\n76\n00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.160\nAgain there's nothing\nthat you can't overcome.\n\n77\n00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.280\nI mean it's a flexible architecture, but\n\n78\n00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.750\nfar better to invest the time\nto get it right at the start.\n\n79\n00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.840\nSo one of the first design\nconsiderations to consider is\n\n80\n00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.070\nare we gonna have SharePoint on-prem?\n\n81\n00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.660\nNow there was a nasty rumor that after\n2016 that will be it, in other words,\n\n82\n00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.670\nMicrosoft was not gonna release any\nmore on-prem SharePoint deployments.\n\n83\n00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.269\nThat is not the case, so\nas long as there's demand\n\n84\n00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.460\nMicrosoft will keep releasing\non-premises versions of SharePoint.\n\n85\n00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.860\nWhich is good news because some of us work\nin environments where we may be open to\n\n86\n00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.810\nsome kind of hybrid deployment, so some\nelements on-premises, some in the cloud.\n\n87\n00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.930\nBut others, we just want strictly\non-premises deployment of SharePoint, and\n\n88\n00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.220\nthat path will be supported going forward.\n\n89\n00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.940\n>> Yeah, you talked about certain\nscenarios where it might be\n\n90\n00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.620\nlegal requirements, either industry or\n\n91\n00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.600\ngovernmental, that say we can't\nstore this out in the cloud.\n\n92\n00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.850\nAnd I don't wanna invest all my time and\nmoney getting SharePoint set up only\n\n93\n00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.200\nto find out that they're not gonna\ncontinue the support for us.\n\n94\n00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.080\nSo good to know that we can go with\nan on-premise solution, we don't have to\n\n95\n00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.760\nworry about it being yanked out from\nunder us in the next server release.\n\n96\n00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.950\n>> Exactly right.\n\n97\n00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.860\nSo this is also important for\nthose of you watching\n\n98\n00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.630\nfrom different countries because not\nevery country that Microsoft sells in,\n\n99\n00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.700\nwhich I think is every country in\nthe world, almost every country, at least.\n\n100\n00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.100\nNot everyone's gonna have sufficient\nresources to justify cloud investments.\n\n101\n00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.720\nIn other words,\nthere is no cloud first of all.\n\n102\n00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.240\nI mean, those Google balloons,\nthose are providing Wi-Fi, that's true,\n\n103\n00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.100\nbut there's no Microsoft\nmagical cloud in the sky.\n\n104\n00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.068\nAlthough they were talking\nabout underground data centers.\n\n105\n00:05:51.068 --> 00:05:53.342\n>> I've read some of those articles,\nthat is interesting, yes.\n\n106\n00:05:53.342 --> 00:05:54.039\n>> And under water.\n\n107\n00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.362\n>> Yes, yes, very cool.\n\n108\n00:05:55.362 --> 00:05:58.126\n>> Yeah, I mean,\nnaturally cooled, so [LAUGH].\n\n109\n00:05:58.126 --> 00:06:02.795\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyway, so it's a storage box,\n\n110\n00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:07.330\nI mean,\na huge railcar-sized box of servers.\n\n111\n00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.090\nThat's what the cloud infrastructure is,\nand, of course, physical security is high.\n\n112\n00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.800\nSo you can't get close to them,\nit's a gated environment.\n\n113\n00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.000\nBut those are the resources\nrunning the cloud.\n\n114\n00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.460\nSo if you're in a country like Canada, for\n\n115\n00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.622\nexample, I know there's\nsome Canadians watching.\n\n116\n00:06:22.622 --> 00:06:23.596\n>> Hurrah?\n\n117\n00:06:23.596 --> 00:06:24.558\n>> Hurrah.\n\n118\n00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.560\nI mean, it's slated for release this\nyear in a couple of Canadian cities but\n\n119\n00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.380\nat this point there is no cloud\ninfrastructure for Microsoft.\n\n120\n00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.430\nSo if you're working for\na Canadian governmental agency you may be\n\n121\n00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.520\nprohibited by law from using Microsoft\ncloud services because the data is-\n\n122\n00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.720\n>> Stored outside of the country.\n\n123\n00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.261\n>> That's right, in the US.\n\n124\n00:06:43.261 --> 00:06:47.240\nSo that's why a lot of Microsoft Canada\ncustomers have been saying,\n\n125\n00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.720\nhey Microsoft,\nwe're open to dipping our toe and\n\n126\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.980\ntrying out some cloud services,\nbeyond e-mail, which everybody uses.\n\n127\n00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.490\nBut we'll need to have\n\n128\n00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.960\nthe physical data stored in Canada in\norder to be willing to move forward.\n\n129\n00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.100\nSo not every country has the population,\nas I was mentioning before,\n\n130\n00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.350\nto justify Microsoft's expenditure\nof putting the compute resources\n\n131\n00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.580\nphysically in that country.\n\n132\n00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.810\nOf course, there may be other\nconcerns like physical security or\n\n133\n00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:20.350\nwar zones that also prevent\nthat cloud storage.\n\n134\n00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.785\nSo the point is, you're gonna\nhave some combination of entirely\n\n135\n00:07:24.785 --> 00:07:28.080\non-premises SharePoint deployment,\nand it's either gonna be brand new or\n\n136\n00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.290\nsome kind of upgrade from\nyour existing environment.\n\n137\n00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:36.490\nYou may decide to go entirely online,\nin the cloud, in other words.\n\n138\n00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:42.595\nSo a combination of SharePoint online and\nprobably with Office 365 as well,\n\n139\n00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:47.895\nbut you have choices there, and\nhybrid deployments are supported.\n\n140\n00:07:47.895 --> 00:07:51.001\nSo you can move workloads around.\n\n141\n00:07:51.001 --> 00:07:55.217\nYou might try out a cloud resource, for\nexample, hosting a SharePoint online,\n\n142\n00:07:55.217 --> 00:07:59.247\nthen decide that the price point is not\nYou're not getting the performance or\n\n143\n00:07:59.247 --> 00:08:01.417\nthe bang for the buck you expected, and so\n\n144\n00:08:01.417 --> 00:08:04.040\nyou might pull that work\nload back onto premises.\n\n145\n00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.740\nYou've got that flexibility.\n\n146\n00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:10.990\nBut you still need to decide whether\nto keep your existing on prem Cloud or\n\n147\n00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.670\nHybrid Deployment, whether or\nnot you want to keep using or\n\n148\n00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.250\nstart using Office 365 and\nSharePoint Online.\n\n149\n00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:20.620\nThat's a fundamental decision which\nwill guide future decisions regarding\n\n150\n00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.970\nSharePoint planning.\n\n151\n00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.710\nAll right so I mentioned stake holders.\n\n152\n00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.010\nThat's one of those jargon words that show\nup in those, when you're playing bingo,\n\n153\n00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.412\nlisten to a conference speaker.\n\n154\n00:08:30.412 --> 00:08:32.128\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And somebody says bingo,\n\n155\n00:08:32.128 --> 00:08:35.020\nbecause there's an ex jargon\nwords on your bingo board.\n\n156\n00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.020\n>> Right.\n>> What does that even mean,\n\n157\n00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:36.890\nstake holders?\n\n158\n00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:40.100\nPeople with a vested interest\nin the outcome of a deployment.\n\n159\n00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:45.890\nPeople who would be negatively\nimpacted if it goes south.\n\n160\n00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:51.060\nWho should comprise this committee\nthat decides about SharePoint design?\n\n161\n00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.050\nWell, we've certainly got business users.\n\n162\n00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:58.790\nI always advocate that somebody is\nadvocating for employees or customers?\n\n163\n00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.310\nThink of employees as internal customers.\n\n164\n00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.090\nWho else do we have?\n\n165\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.220\nCertainly security personnel.\n\n166\n00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.070\nYou know there's a lot of\nfinancial interest now in hacking,\n\n167\n00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.960\nstealing credit numbers.\n\n168\n00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.710\nNational security is a risk so\n\n169\n00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.620\nthere's people that their whole\nexistence is predicated on hacking.\n\n170\n00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.970\nThere's organized crime involved,\nransomware.\n\n171\n00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.060\nSome of you may know people who\nhave been impacted by that,\n\n172\n00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.630\nwhere your computer data is preserved.\n\n173\n00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.301\nBut in order to access it,\nyou have to pay a fee, so.\n\n174\n00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:31.308\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n175\n00:09:31.308 --> 00:09:33.211\n>> That's ransomware.\n\n176\n00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:34.553\nData managers.\n\n177\n00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:41.040\nCertainly your IT staff and maybe some\nother group that I haven't mentioned\n\n178\n00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.680\nthat's particular to your environment or\nyour customer's environment.\n\n179\n00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.680\nBut certainly anyone that,\nagain can benefit\n\n180\n00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.185\nfrom some new process in SharePoint or\nwill be impacted somehow.\n\n181\n00:09:51.185 --> 00:09:56.290\nThere has to be a voice representing\nthat group of people at the table.\n\n182\n00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:01.360\nOften IT may deploy something or marketing\nmight get a hold of something and it's\n\n183\n00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.010\njust, they make what looks like a pretty\npage but it's really not functional.\n\n184\n00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.170\nIn fact it's downright irritating for\nemployees, customers,\n\n185\n00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.810\nvendors potentially to actually do what\nthey want when they come to your site.\n\n186\n00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:18.290\nSo that's another kind of information\narchitecture conversation.\n\n187\n00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.860\nBut hey it's our show we can\ntalk about whatever we want so.\n\n188\n00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.171\n>> That's right [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna throw in a name here a fellow\n\n189\n00:10:24.171 --> 00:10:27.679\nnamed Jerry McGovern,\nhe sends out emails every Sunday and\n\n190\n00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:29.937\nhe's all about top task management.\n\n191\n00:10:29.937 --> 00:10:34.930\nSo he says make it really easy for\npeople to get work done.\n\n192\n00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.270\nSo in other words,\nwhen they go to the website,\n\n193\n00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.780\nthey don't want to see a laundry list\nof links and a really crowded page.\n\n194\n00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.530\nWhich makes it hard to get anything\ndone or to do what you came to do.\n\n195\n00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.390\nSo identify the top three reasons\npeople are going to a page.\n\n196\n00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:52.880\nSay, whether it's your intranet or\na team site or your product ordering site.\n\n197\n00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.310\nIf it's an online, Internet based page or\n\n198\n00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.530\nsite you're hosting,\nwhere people can make orders.\n\n199\n00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.930\nMake it really easy to do\nwhat they came to do, and\n\n200\n00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.230\neverything else must be deprecated.\n\n201\n00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.010\nSo, the champion for that,\n\n202\n00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:10.290\nBing, or you think of Google, they're\nalways simplifying their interface.\n\n203\n00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.410\nAnd then, so,\nthat search box is ubiquitous.\n\n204\n00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.810\nThat's why people go to\nGoogle to search for things.\n\n205\n00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.240\nIf they want other options,\n\n206\n00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:21.800\nthey go to the waffle and they can access\ntranslation or news or what have you.\n\n207\n00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.150\nIn other words make it really easy for\n\n208\n00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.880\nusers to do what they\ncame to your site to do.\n\n209\n00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.720\nDon't make life hard.\n\n210\n00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.750\nThe problem is what we found\nis SharePoint sometimes,\n\n211\n00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.860\nlet's say we have\na departmental guinea pig.\n\n212\n00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:39.420\nSo we invest resources, and\nmaybe it's the IT department, for\n\n213\n00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.700\nexample, or\nsome regional department website.\n\n214\n00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.720\nAnd then, they start getting a good buzz,\nand people saying, wow,\n\n215\n00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.390\nthe way they're doing it is saving\nthem a lot of time, we want that.\n\n216\n00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.960\nOr we want our link on that page.\n\n217\n00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.100\nAnd the thing is if you start saying\nyes to everybody that wants a link or\n\n218\n00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.240\nsome functionality on the page it gets\nbogged down and less useful for everybody.\n\n219\n00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.950\nSo to be an effective, and\nthis relates to governess too, but\n\n220\n00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:07.730\nto be an effective SharePoint environment,\nsomebody has to say no.\n\n221\n00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.970\nNo we're not gonna put\nthat link on this page,\n\n222\n00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.390\nno that web part does not belong here.\n\n223\n00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.620\nYou can have it on this page over here.\n\n224\n00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.615\nWe don't need a breadcrumb\ntrail with links.\n\n225\n00:12:16.615 --> 00:12:20.330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All the links or may we do or\n\n226\n00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.960\ncertain tabs but not.\n\n227\n00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.080\nWe don't wanna overwhelm the viewer\nwhen they get to a page.\n\n228\n00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.974\nAnd they're just absolutely in shock.\n\n229\n00:12:27.974 --> 00:12:29.145\nAnd don't know what to do or where to go.\n\n230\n00:12:29.145 --> 00:12:30.248\nSo I wanna make it easier for them.\n\n231\n00:12:30.248 --> 00:12:37.339\nOkay so governance is another\nhuge element of this puzzle.\n\n232\n00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:39.570\nSo, often, there might be turf wars or\n\n233\n00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:42.288\njust disagreements about\nhow to create a page.\n\n234\n00:12:42.288 --> 00:12:45.382\nOr what should be prominent, or\nwhat the purpose of the page is, or\n\n235\n00:12:45.382 --> 00:12:48.270\nwhat are we even doing with\nSharePoint period, right?\n\n236\n00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.310\nSo somebody has to be\nempowered to make a decision.\n\n237\n00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.381\nThis is the first priority,\nthis is second, this is third,\n\n238\n00:12:54.381 --> 00:12:57.934\nand then others, nice to have,\nwe're not going to do them this year,\n\n239\n00:12:57.934 --> 00:13:00.308\nmaybe next year we'll\nget to those projects.\n\n240\n00:13:00.308 --> 00:13:08.293\nSo the governance committee gets to\ndecide the person that gets to decide.\n\n241\n00:13:08.293 --> 00:13:12.852\nIn other words, we're saying,\nJoe Smith, you get to decide on what\n\n242\n00:13:12.852 --> 00:13:17.740\nthe top three priorities for SharePoint\nare in our deployment this year.\n\n243\n00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.400\nYou have the final say in the matter.\n\n244\n00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:25.110\nAnd then people are clear,\nif there's no obvious and\n\n245\n00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.930\ndeclared hierarchy,\nyou're gonna get turf wars with people.\n\n246\n00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.020\nMaybe they have the same job title and\n\n247\n00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.690\nmaybe get into political considerations\nwhere there are different countries.\n\n248\n00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:37.350\nAnd you know they want their\npage to be the homepage.\n\n249\n00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:38.880\nSo European division and\n\n250\n00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.704\nthen you have to click on another page\nto get to the US division or something.\n\n251\n00:13:42.704 --> 00:13:46.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> To avoid these silly human turf war\n\n252\n00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.560\ntype scenarios, governance\ncommittee has to decide everything\n\n253\n00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.450\nreally in terms of who gets to decide.\n\n254\n00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:55.590\nSo what are some of\nthe checklist items you need to\n\n255\n00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.320\nget clarity on before deploying.\n\n256\n00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.940\nAnd when I say deploying\nalso including upgrading.\n\n257\n00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.100\nSo these are same considerations and\nif you are upgrading from 2013,\n\n258\n00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:08.040\nthis is a good time to set\na clean house and think, okay.\n\n259\n00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:15.460\nMaybe you haven't turfed out some old\ncontent and it's time to do that.\n\n260\n00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.240\nFor example old product manuals,\n\n261\n00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.495\ndo you really want the price\nlist from 2012 on your site?\n\n262\n00:14:19.495 --> 00:14:22.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean it may be a negative because\n\n263\n00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.480\ncustomers may compare the pricing and\nsay hey, it went up 50%.\n\n264\n00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.415\nWhat up with that?\n\n265\n00:14:26.415 --> 00:14:29.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's and it helps again.\n\n266\n00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.440\nUsers, whether they're internal,\n\n267\n00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.970\nexternal, find the content they're\nlooking for by pruning, deleting,\n\n268\n00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:40.450\njust getting rid of any old content that's\nno longer valid or perhaps now inaccurate.\n\n269\n00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.720\nI mean you might reference a product\nyou no longer sell, for example.\n\n270\n00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.530\nOr maybe you sold that\nproduct to a competitor.\n\n271\n00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.679\nSo you don't even represent\nthe product any more.\n\n272\n00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.953\nSo a good time to prune and upgrade.\n\n273\n00:14:50.953 --> 00:14:55.230\nSo what do you need to, so\nonce you've decided, okay,\n\n274\n00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:59.520\ndo we wanna go on Prem,\nhybrid, entirely in the Cloud?\n\n275\n00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.710\nAre we using Office 365,\nare we using SharePoint Online?\n\n276\n00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.130\nThose are basic considerations.\n\n277\n00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.880\nOr are we using SharePoint for intranet?\n\n278\n00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.480\nAre we hosting an intranet portal?\n\n279\n00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.290\nAnd that might involve, maybe you\nhave a different solution now and\n\n280\n00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.320\nyou realize hey we're paying\na lot of money for SharePoint.\n\n281\n00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.900\nLet's get the most out of it.\n\n282\n00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.190\nAnd maybe it doesn't look quite as\npretty as the other offering but\n\n283\n00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:19.050\nit's good enough for internal use.\n\n284\n00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:25.690\nSo let's port that old website over\nto an Internet hosted environment.\n\n285\n00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.500\nDo you need external collaboration?\n\n286\n00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:35.130\nMore and more we're partnering up with,\ncoopetition is a buzz word.\n\n287\n00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:39.020\nIt's a portmanteau, I think that's\nthe right word, between competition and\n\n288\n00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:39.960\ncooperation.\n\n289\n00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.200\nSo sure there are competitors but\nwe may need to join with them.\n\n290\n00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.260\nLet's say it's a bridge\nbuilding project and\n\n291\n00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.910\nwe're a construction company but we don't\nhave the resources to build a bridge.\n\n292\n00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.976\nWe have to partner up with other firms.\n\n293\n00:15:51.976 --> 00:15:57.048\nSo in that case, how would you provide\nthe right kind of access, shared access,\n\n294\n00:15:57.048 --> 00:16:01.687\nto your competitors who are cooperating\nwith you on this bid process say?\n\n295\n00:16:01.687 --> 00:16:06.176\nWithout unnecessarily exposing other\nresources that should be kept private and\n\n296\n00:16:06.176 --> 00:16:08.560\naway from your competitor's eyes.\n\n297\n00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.030\nSo in other words, you need an extra\nnet for external collaboration.\n\n298\n00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:19.040\nAre you considering using SharePoint\nas a records management tool?\n\n299\n00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.810\nRemember, SharePoint is\na Swiss Army knife of technology.\n\n300\n00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:25.740\nSo, document management is one thing.\n\n301\n00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.240\nWhat is records management?\n\n302\n00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.380\nThat is, typically,\na record is something that's finalized,\n\n303\n00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.170\nso a contract, for example.\n\n304\n00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.528\nNow you may re-up the contract,\nbut let's say your contract or\n\n305\n00:16:35.528 --> 00:16:41.525\n2016 is finalized, it's signed off on,\nyou've got digital signatures,\n\n306\n00:16:41.525 --> 00:16:44.835\nit just needs to be stored now because\nyou might need to refer to it later.\n\n307\n00:16:44.835 --> 00:16:48.005\nWell, we have a special\ntemplate in SharePoint.\n\n308\n00:16:48.005 --> 00:16:50.945\nAgain, you don't have to\nreinvent the wheel of SharePoint,\n\n309\n00:16:50.945 --> 00:16:53.075\nthat's the beauty of it,\nthere's all kind of builds in templates.\n\n310\n00:16:53.075 --> 00:16:55.059\nAnd one of them is for records management.\n\n311\n00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.950\nSo it requires some librarian type skills,\nwhich I often refer to\n\n312\n00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:05.720\nto figure out how to organize that\ndocument, or sorry, that record center.\n\n313\n00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.490\nAnd then what will happen\nfrom a user perspective.\n\n314\n00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:13.790\nSo let's say I'm charged with finalizing\nthe storage of a customer contract and\n\n315\n00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.290\ndeclaring it a record,\nI can right click that document,\n\n316\n00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:20.100\nit's like the context menu, and\nsend it to a records library.\n\n317\n00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:24.530\nAnd because I've automatically set\nup the classification in advance,\n\n318\n00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:28.300\nthat record will automatically be\nfiled in the appropriate place,\n\n319\n00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:33.080\nwhich could be by calendar year,\nby customer type, for\n\n320\n00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.200\nexample, or any other information,\n\n321\n00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.290\norganization structure that's already\nbeen set up in that records center.\n\n322\n00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.990\nSo, do you want records management,\nin other words.\n\n323\n00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.970\nNow, one of the things that's\namazing about SharePoint, and\n\n324\n00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:51.610\nwe don't get into this week,\nthat could easily be a week in itself,\n\n325\n00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:54.520\nis SharePoint integration\nwith Project Server.\n\n326\n00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:59.400\nSo some of you are using Project Server\nintegrated with SharePoint Server, so\n\n327\n00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.400\na great way to manage workflow for\nconstruction projects or what have you, so\n\n328\n00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.460\nthat's kinda cool.\n\n329\n00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:10.700\nAnd then sorry, another completely\nseparate aspect is social.\n\n330\n00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.710\nSo some organizations,\n\n331\n00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.480\nthey specifically deploy SharePoint\nbecause they want the social aspect.\n\n332\n00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.410\nRemember Microsoft bought 5% of Facebook,\nright?\n\n333\n00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:23.750\nWhich then valued Facebook in the hundreds\nof millions I think at that point.\n\n334\n00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:25.350\nBased on their 5% investment.\n\n335\n00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.660\nBut the point is there's some\nsocial tools built into SharePoint.\n\n336\n00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.440\nSo for example I can like something,\nlike a document,\n\n337\n00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.660\nI can rate it if that's been enabled so\nzero to five stars for example.\n\n338\n00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.760\nAnd this will help other people who\nare maybe searching for content.\n\n339\n00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.170\nThat will effect the search\nrankings based on,\n\n340\n00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.670\nit makes sense if many other\npeople have already liked or\n\n341\n00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.420\nhighly rated a document, it probably\nshould be higher in the search results.\n\n342\n00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.950\n>> Right.\nAnd that is part of the secret sauce about\n\n343\n00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:57.900\nhow search results get ranked when\nyou're searching in SharePoint.\n\n344\n00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.630\nBut having said that, for\n\n345\n00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:05.450\na lot of companies It's another aspect of\nsocial computing is this idea of My Sites.\n\n346\n00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:10.974\nSo My Sites it's everyone gets, if you\nenable it, and I start up my My Sites,\n\n347\n00:19:10.974 --> 00:19:14.422\nI initialize it,\nthen I get my own private site collection.\n\n348\n00:19:14.422 --> 00:19:18.553\nNow this could drive some people\ninto a frenzy because they think,\n\n349\n00:19:18.553 --> 00:19:19.970\nhow can I manage this?\n\n350\n00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:21.940\nIt's some else's private site collection.\n\n351\n00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.850\nI don't have control over it.\n\n352\n00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.610\nSo, for some organizations,\n\n353\n00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.930\nthey absolutely do not deploy\nthe My Sites functionality.\n\n354\n00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.820\nOthers, embrace\nthe My Sites functionality.\n\n355\n00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.900\nSo, with that,\njust like if you think of Facebook, or\n\n356\n00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.070\nmaybe, LinkedIn, or\nother social media platforms.\n\n357\n00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:44.070\nThe user now, is empowered to create, has\nchoice, when it comes to privacy settings.\n\n358\n00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:48.150\nSo for example, there's all kinds of\nfields I could fill out that go way\n\n359\n00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.750\nbeyond Active Directory\nfields in SharePoint.\n\n360\n00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.020\nLike what school I went to,\nor what my hobbies are,\n\n361\n00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.920\nor maybe what programming\nlanguages I know.\n\n362\n00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:01.550\nSo I can choose to expose certain\ncontent to say just my manager.\n\n363\n00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:04.131\nFor example, if I had a home phone,\nI haven't had one for a long time.\n\n364\n00:20:04.131 --> 00:20:05.458\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But if I had a home phone.\n\n365\n00:20:05.458 --> 00:20:07.320\nWell let's say my cell phone.\n\n366\n00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.320\nThat's something I do have.\n\n367\n00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.400\nI may choose that I only\nwant my manager and\n\n368\n00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.595\nmaybe my immediate reports\nto know my cell number.\n\n369\n00:20:16.595 --> 00:20:22.450\nEveryone else can't see that or\ncertain documents,\n\n370\n00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:26.470\nso it's my own little fiefdom, my own\nsite collection if my sites is enabled,\n\n371\n00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.750\nI can choose who gets to see what.\n\n372\n00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.460\nI can also define who my colleagues are,\nand\n\n373\n00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.570\nthen, again,\nexpose content to them or not.\n\n374\n00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:37.210\nSo, this is something to plan\nbecause there are certainly\n\n375\n00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.480\nresource requirements involved.\n\n376\n00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:43.380\nIf you create My Sites and we'll look\nat those we demo later in the week.\n\n377\n00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:47.340\nAnd then,\nyou need to know what you have now.\n\n378\n00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.320\nWhat content you have now\nin a SharePoint context and\n\n379\n00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.050\nwhat content do you want\nto bring in to SharePoint?\n\n380\n00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.810\nAnd this brings up another point,\nwhich is some people think!\n\n381\n00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.410\nWe've got SharePoint I should\nport all my file server\n\n382\n00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.440\ncontact into SharePoint right away.\n\n383\n00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.260\nThat's not a good idea, there's no\nneed remember with SharePoint search\n\n384\n00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.730\nwe can search any organized data source\nfile shares, exchange public folders,\n\n385\n00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.280\nwebsites, etc, databases.\n\n386\n00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.950\nSo leave existing data where it is.\n\n387\n00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:20.090\nThere's no benefit to\nporting it into SharePoint.\n\n388\n00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.330\nIn fact since it uses SQL storage it's\nactually more expensive to store.\n\n389\n00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.880\nAnd certain content just\ndoes not lend itself well or\n\n390\n00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.969\nas well to SharePoint\nstorage like video content.\n\n391\n00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.900\nSo that's something to consider,\n\n392\n00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:37.190\nwhat content that you want to\ncreate going forward in SharePoint.\n\n393\n00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:42.630\nSo SharePoint really shines when it comes\nto newly created collaborative content.\n\n394\n00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:43.180\nIn other words,\n\n395\n00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:48.320\ncontent that requires input from a variety\nof people, and that's a consideration.\n\n396\n00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:48.960\nBut again,\n\n397\n00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:54.220\nyou need to know what your current data\nstores are and what needs to be indexed.\n\n398\n00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.120\nWhat should be turfed out.\n\n399\n00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.840\nIt's like when you move a house.\n\n400\n00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.676\nDo you wanna bring all\nthe garbage with you or\n\n401\n00:21:58.676 --> 00:22:00.967\nold papers if you still have\nprint versions of papers?\n\n402\n00:22:00.967 --> 00:22:03.610\nNo, you should delete stuff.\n\n403\n00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.990\nGet rid of old clothes rather than\nmove it to the new environment.\n\n404\n00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.880\nwell this is a good time, the SharePoint\nas well, whether your deploying for\n\n405\n00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.860\nthe first time or migrating,\nget rid of the stuff you don't need.\n\n406\n00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.640\n>> Probably learned a lot from\nthrough first deployment and maybe\n\n407\n00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.090\nchanged some ideas or maybe you're moving\nto a different direction with SharePoint,\n\n408\n00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.580\nwant to add or\nremove some of that functionality.\n\n409\n00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.080\nGood time to just clean all that up.\n\n410\n00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.110\n>> Indeed, indeed.\n\n411\n00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:32.267\nSo one of the elements of SharePoint that\ndoesn't migrate well and has historically\n\n412\n00:22:32.267 --> 00:22:37.363\nnot migrated is any kind of customizations\nor solutions you may have implemented.\n\n413\n00:22:37.363 --> 00:22:42.420\nIt's rather than migrate them and\nfix what's broken later.\n\n414\n00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:48.070\nIt's best to assume that any\ncustomizations will not migrate and\n\n415\n00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.830\nthen recreate those migrations, sorry,\n\n416\n00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:55.460\nrecreate those customizations fresh\nin the new version of SharePoint.\n\n417\n00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.470\nIt's a bit of hassle for\n\n418\n00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.940\nsure because you'll have to probably\ndo things a little differently.\n\n419\n00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:04.000\nDepending on what the customization is but\ncompared to headache of trying to trouble\n\n420\n00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.160\nshoot a customization that\nsort of upgraded, hassle.\n\n421\n00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.380\nSo we want, generally wanna\nstrip away any customizations.\n\n422\n00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:17.690\nJust go vanilla that, that pertains to\nthings like master pages, site themes.\n\n423\n00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:19.830\nMaybe some custom work flows.\n\n424\n00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:20.860\nThird party tools,\n\n425\n00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:25.050\na whole other conversation as\nwell in terms of your planning.\n\n426\n00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:27.320\nA lot of people will take\nadvantage of third party tools.\n\n427\n00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.450\nThose need to be evaluated as well, and\n\n428\n00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.180\nyou can go to the vendor website,\nif the vendor's still in business.\n\n429\n00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:37.912\nAnd they'll have some guidance about what\nwill migrate successfully and what won't.\n\n430\n00:23:37.912 --> 00:23:44.260\nNow even if, they may say yes, our\nbrilliant customization is 100% certified.\n\n431\n00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.870\nIt will migrate successfully.\n\n432\n00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:46.970\nYou never know.\n\n433\n00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.937\nIt's impossible to test\nall the permutations.\n\n434\n00:23:48.937 --> 00:23:53.134\nThat's why, even if when it comes\nto physical sizing you have to\n\n435\n00:23:53.134 --> 00:23:57.177\nconsider yourself one of one\nthere are general guidelines but\n\n436\n00:23:57.177 --> 00:24:00.383\nthere is next one chance\nthat there will be some.\n\n437\n00:24:00.383 --> 00:24:05.231\nUnique tweak in your environment that's\ngonna be a new kind of error that maybe\n\n438\n00:24:05.231 --> 00:24:07.190\nhasn't been seen before.\n\n439\n00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.390\nBut we're talking about\ngeneral principles here.\n\n440\n00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:12.010\nBut expect any customizations\nto not work and\n\n441\n00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:16.080\nplan to create them newly in the new\nin this case the 2016 environment.\n\n442\n00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:22.880\nBy the way when it comes to SharePoint\nonline think of SharePoint 2016 and\n\n443\n00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.855\nany future release for\n\n444\n00:24:24.855 --> 00:24:30.190\non prem as a supported snapshot of\nthe functionality in the Cloud.\n\n445\n00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:32.390\nThink about that for a minute.\n\n446\n00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.390\nA supported snapshot.\n\n447\n00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:39.120\nThe pace of change now is so vast\nonline you may of discovered already in\n\n448\n00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.680\nthe Cloud for example you may run\na power [INAUDIBLE] Script that works in\n\n449\n00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.040\nthe morning in the afternoon there\nis some perimeter that changed or\n\n450\n00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.509\nthat was expected and you didn't provided\nit and your script doesn't work.\n\n451\n00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:51.390\nUnfortunately the documentation for\n\n452\n00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:55.080\nchanges in the Cloud often\nlags behind the actual change.\n\n453\n00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.800\nAnd sometimes it's just an experiment,\nlike Facebook for example,\n\n454\n00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.950\nexperiment with certain functionality.\n\n455\n00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:00.920\nAnd then it'll disappear.\n\n456\n00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.490\nSimilarly, Microsoft with\nAzure solutions we'll test\n\n457\n00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:10.035\nout new functionality and decide whether\nor not to keep it based on some feedback.\n\n458\n00:25:10.035 --> 00:25:10.580\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n459\n00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.180\n>> So you could consider yourself\na guinea pig in that sense.\n\n460\n00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The benefit though,\n\n461\n00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.470\nis that instead of having the expense and\nall this planning we're talking about in\n\n462\n00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:23.910\nthis episode, I'm sure you can tell\nthere's a lot of factors to consider and\n\n463\n00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.790\nwrite down, document\n>> But\n\n464\n00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:31.080\nthe benefit of using an online service,\nis your getting regular upgrades.\n\n465\n00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.980\nSometimes daily or\neven more than once a day.\n\n466\n00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.900\nSo your getting incremental improvements\nin your SharePoint deployment.\n\n467\n00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.920\nSo that is one of reasons why\nthose who have gone to a fully.\n\n468\n00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:46.820\nA full Cloud online investment Share Point\nonline, nothing on Prem, that's why,\n\n469\n00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.670\nbecause they don't have\nto worry about upgrades.\n\n470\n00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:51.175\nIt's being upgraded for\nthem automagically.\n\n471\n00:25:51.175 --> 00:25:55.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, metadata,\n\n472\n00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.560\nwe talked about in a different episode the\nimportance of properly classifying data.\n\n473\n00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:04.130\nYou need to know what you're migrating\n>> What information you need to\n\n474\n00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:08.710\ncapture about that data,\nis also very important.\n\n475\n00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:14.270\nAnd again, a good chance to bring together\npeople standardized on definitions for\n\n476\n00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:15.680\nour customer.\n\n477\n00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.950\nOur customer entity.\n\n478\n00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:18.660\nWhat is the crucial date of the capture?\n\n479\n00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.500\nShould we be capturing new data now?\n\n480\n00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.020\nMaybe something pertaining to some\nregulation like HIPPA for example.\n\n481\n00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:30.320\nSo maybe we're required to record some\nextra information to being compliance.\n\n482\n00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:34.220\nSo that depends on where you live or\nwhere your company operates.\n\n483\n00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.700\nThe industry you're in as well.\n\n484\n00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.220\nSo, these are factors to consider.\n\n485\n00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.130\nSo for your old data, you may want to.\n\n486\n00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:46.350\nI talked about the importance\nof deleting old data.\n\n487\n00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:49.890\nMaybe it's data that you don't\nneed online all the time.\n\n488\n00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:52.320\nYou'd like to have available or near line.\n\n489\n00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.660\nSo you may wanna archive some data.\n\n490\n00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.890\nSo speaking of a hybrid environment,\none thing people are doing is\n\n491\n00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:02.320\nthey are keeping all their\nactive business data on-prem and\n\n492\n00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.480\nthen the archived content\nthey're storing in the Cloud.\n\n493\n00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.960\nThat way they don't have to\nworry about backup tapes and\n\n494\n00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.730\nwhether the media has a finite life.\n\n495\n00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:14.860\nSo rather than having to test old\ntape drives, for example, old tapes.\n\n496\n00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:17.160\nTo make sure they're still good to go.\n\n497\n00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.470\nYou can archive in the Cloud.\n\n498\n00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.010\nNow it's still good to do a trial restore,\n\n499\n00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:21.460\nas even though the content\nis stored in the Cloud.\n\n500\n00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:26.410\nBut at least it's safer there than maybe\n\n501\n00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:31.200\ntapes that people may lose track of where\nthe tapes go, or other backup media.\n\n502\n00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:35.050\nOkay!\n\n503\n00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:38.500\nAnother thing to consider is quotas.\n\n504\n00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:42.040\nDo you want to modify\nquotas on team sites.\n\n505\n00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:46.240\nSo, again,\nwe definitely want to get away from people\n\n506\n00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.900\nemailing attachments back and forth.\n\n507\n00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.130\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> So\nyou might want to revisit.\n\n508\n00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:53.010\nOkay, so for these team sites\nis this quota too restrictive?\n\n509\n00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:54.160\nIs it too generous?\n\n510\n00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.630\nDo we want to restrict the file types,\nnow?\n\n511\n00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:01.780\nSome people say, hey,\nit's my personal quasi Netflix server, or\n\n512\n00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.450\nmy video repository,\nI'll just upload some movies.\n\n513\n00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.960\nThat could expose you\nto legal ramifications,\n\n514\n00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.200\nas well as just the waste of storage.\n\n515\n00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.770\nSharePoint thankfully gives us tools to\n\n516\n00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:20.290\nrestrict the kinds of content that users\nare even allowed to store in SharePoint.\n\n517\n00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.570\nNow, depending on your industry,\nif you're creating video for\n\n518\n00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:25.055\na living,\nthen obviously you need to allow video.\n\n519\n00:28:25.055 --> 00:28:26.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But if you're not,\n\n520\n00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:30.720\nthen those MP3s that have\nmaybe copyright infringed,\n\n521\n00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:34.560\nit's a good time to check for\nlegal compliance as well.\n\n522\n00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.880\nSo you might want to do a file audit.\n\n523\n00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:42.870\nA lot of people don't know all the content\nthat's on their various file servers for\n\n524\n00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:46.040\nexample, or in SharePoint deployments,\nbecause they've never investigated.\n\n525\n00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:50.940\nSo that might be a time for a third\nparty tool to get an overall picture and\n\n526\n00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.120\nnice reports, pie charts,\netc, both the percentage\n\n527\n00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.100\nbreakdowns on different kinds of\ncontent in your SharePoint environment.\n\n528\n00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.682\n>> I wasn't realizing you're\nhosting all of that MP3 content.\n\n529\n00:29:01.682 --> 00:29:04.633\n[LAUGH]\n>> Wonder why I'm bad with so\n\n530\n00:29:04.633 --> 00:29:06.030\nmuch last month.\n\n531\n00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:06.950\nExactly.\nOkay.\n\n532\n00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:13.600\nSo, in SharePoint we enable\nfunctionality by turning on features.\n\n533\n00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.840\nSome features apply at the farm level,\nso our entire share-point deployment.\n\n534\n00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:22.460\nOthers apply at the web app level,\nCyclex level, or site level, so\n\n535\n00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.760\ngoing from large to small.\n\n536\n00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:29.340\nAnd that's how we enable functionality or\nintroduce new functionality,\n\n537\n00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:33.010\nmaybe by a third-party solution or\nour devs have provided.\n\n538\n00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:37.410\nMaybe it gives us some new button or\nmenu option.\n\n539\n00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:41.120\nSo do we need all those\nfeatures enabled going forward,\n\n540\n00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.080\nor are some of those features,\ndo they no longer apply?\n\n541\n00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:49.840\nbecause we no longer utilize\nthat work flow, for example.\n\n542\n00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:53.390\nAnd then work flows,\nthis leads on to work flows,\n\n543\n00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:57.320\nwhich your work flows may be outdated\nas well and you have to assume,\n\n544\n00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:01.270\njust like customization's, that work flows\naren't necessarily going to translate and\n\n545\n00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:05.810\nwork as you expected them to in\n2016 like they did in 2013 so\n\n546\n00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:09.080\nplan on redoing all of your workflows.\n\n547\n00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.540\nRelated to that is info path, so\n\n548\n00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:18.770\nthere's no new info path versions planned,\nbut there is support for\n\n549\n00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:25.220\ninfo path 2013 to at least 2024, so\nyou can continue to use info path 2013.\n\n550\n00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.890\nGoing forward for\nat least another eight years.\n\n551\n00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:30.090\nBut just don't expect a new version of it.\n\n552\n00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.580\n>> All right, Mark, again,\na lot of great information there.\n\n553\n00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.840\nA lot of information involving planning.\n\n554\n00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.950\nIt's a big part,\n\n555\n00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:39.590\nif we can't stress it enough,\nof a successful SharePoint deployment.\n\n556\n00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.620\nSo, and we've still got more to go.\n\n557\n00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.080\nWe've got a little bit\nmore planning to do, so.\n\n558\n00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:44.610\nHang with us.\n\n559\n00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:47.300\nHope everybody's enjoying\nwatching these episodes.\n\n560\n00:30:47.300 -->

--> 00:00:19.930\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\ntoday we're doing our SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.011\nAnd specifically, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at both the logical and\n\n5\n00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:25.515\nphysical architecture.\n\n6\n00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:28.768\nThings that we've gotta think about\nduring that planning phase before we\n\n7\n00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:30.640\never get started installing anything.\n\n8\n00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.608\nAnd here to help us with that, of course,\nis the one and only Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n9\n00:00:34.608 --> 00:00:35.570\nHow's it going, Mark?\n\n10\n00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.310\n>> Thanks, Mike.\n\n11\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.030\nGreat to be back.\n\n12\n00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.510\nSo yes, diagrams.\n\n13\n00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.440\nPeople can understand these\nbetter by visualizing so\n\n14\n00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.110\nwe got some diagrams which Mike kindly\ncooked up, looking all professional.\n\n15\n00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.717\n>> Try to anyway.\n\n16\n00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:51.140\n>> Yeah, you did a great job.\n\n17\n00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.910\nAnd this will, if you're familiar with\nSharePoint from previous versions,\n\n18\n00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.380\nit'll be like a review.\n\n19\n00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.630\nBut if you're new to product,\nit's really gonna help you conceptualize.\n\n20\n00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.980\nBecause the terminology,\ngetting a grasp of how we categorize,\n\n21\n00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.270\nand classify, and organize our\ninformation from an IT admin perspective\n\n22\n00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.740\nis gonna be really useful to help\nplan your initial deployment.\n\n23\n00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.979\nHowever small or large that may be.\n\n24\n00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.151\nSo let's pull up our first diagram.\n\n25\n00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:21.719\n>> All right.\n\n26\n00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:28.263\n>> Great, now this is where I should have-\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n\n27\n00:01:28.263 --> 00:01:29.702\n>> Wait, I do have it on my computer,\n\n28\n00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:30.852\nokay, I didn't realize.\n\n29\n00:01:30.852 --> 00:01:37.700\nI need that giant screen we were talking\nabout, the 96 inch, 8K resolution.\n\n30\n00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.920\nOkay, that one, all right, so\nthere's some concepts to get clear on.\n\n31\n00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.220\nAn application pool, if you've worked with\nIAS you may be familiar with the concept.\n\n32\n00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.140\nSo, a little history of IAS,\npart of the reason\n\n33\n00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.709\nin the early days when it was sort of an\neveryone full control mentality with IAS.\n\n34\n00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.870\nWe heard about, let's say,\na rogue website, or\n\n35\n00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.120\nsomeone hacked into a website and\ntaking down the entire server.\n\n36\n00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.330\nSo you might have been running\n2000 websites, and just because of\n\n37\n00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.470\nsome bad code, or someone hacked into one\nwebsite, the whole server got taken down.\n\n38\n00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.190\nThat's not cool.\n\n39\n00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.410\nSo we had a way of essentially subdividing\n\n40\n00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.870\nresources, specifically RAM,\non the IAS server using application pools.\n\n41\n00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.740\nSo this means, worse case scenario, let's\nsay there's some bad code that runs or\n\n42\n00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.540\nsomeone does hack in, the most damage\nthey can do is take down all the websites\n\n43\n00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.460\nhosted in that application pool.\n\n44\n00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.820\nSo think of an application pool as a way\nto subdivide Ram on an IAS machine.\n\n45\n00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.610\nNow there are costs to creating\nmore than one application pool,\n\n46\n00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.720\nbut also some compelling\nsecurity reasons to do so.\n\n47\n00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.290\nSo we'll look at that throughout the week.\n\n48\n00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.371\nSo typically, for example,\n\n49\n00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:57.375\nour central admin website we want to\nsegment its own application pool.\n\n50\n00:02:57.375 --> 00:03:02.085\nThe central admin site, we don't use MMC,\nit's Microsoft Management Consoles,\n\n51\n00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:06.950\nlike we are familiar with using with any\nkind of Windows Server admin for example.\n\n52\n00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.425\nInstead, most of what we do in\nterms of SharePoint configuration,\n\n53\n00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:14.415\nalmost all of it actually,\nis via a web page.\n\n54\n00:03:14.415 --> 00:03:19.289\nAnd the central admin site, we can obscure\nits identity through a port number so\n\n55\n00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:21.848\nvery few people should have access to it.\n\n56\n00:03:21.848 --> 00:03:27.900\nBecause once you do have access to that\nsite you can change anything on the farm.\n\n57\n00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.230\nSo let's talk about a farm.\n\n58\n00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.285\nA farm, in a SharePoint context,\nmeans your entire SharePoint deployment.\n\n59\n00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:37.710\nNow there are some cases where you\nmight have a multiple farm deployment.\n\n60\n00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.040\nBut the vast majority of cases, your\nentire SharePoint context if you will,\n\n61\n00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.960\nor all your SharePoint resources\nwill be contained in a single farm.\n\n62\n00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.900\nNow, you may have interaction with\nanother, a partner organization,\n\n63\n00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.440\nfor example.\n\n64\n00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.710\nThey have their own SharePoint farm so\nthere's, occasionally,\n\n65\n00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.790\nsome trusts you might want to configure.\n\n66\n00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.150\nBut generally, for your own organization,\n\n67\n00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.950\nall your resources, SharePoint related,\nwill exist in that one farm.\n\n68\n00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.490\nSo the application pools\nwe talked about briefly.\n\n69\n00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.015\nNow, web application, this is an IAS\nwebsite on steroids, I like to say.\n\n70\n00:04:13.015 --> 00:04:13.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hopefully,\n\n71\n00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.490\nthat's not politically incorrect in\nthis continuing era of sports doping.\n\n72\n00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.833\n>> No required testing in SharePoint,\nright?\n\n73\n00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:20.470\n>> That's true.\n\n74\n00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're free to take meldonium.\n\n75\n00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.151\nI think that's what it was.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n76\n00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:27.580\n>> To increase your blood flow.\n\n77\n00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.902\nWhich you may need,\nif you spend too much time in IT.\n\n78\n00:04:31.902 --> 00:04:33.310\nNeed a blood thinner maybe.\n\n79\n00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.683\nBut anyway, so web app it's an IAS\nwebsite extended, if you like.\n\n80\n00:04:39.683 --> 00:04:43.505\nIn other words, additional\nfunctionality introduced to allow for\n\n81\n00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:47.400\nSharePoint specific containers and\nfunctionality.\n\n82\n00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.470\nSo we'll be showing you how to install\nthe web app in another episode.\n\n83\n00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.920\nOnce we've installed the web app.\n\n84\n00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.688\nSo remember, that's an IAS\nwebsite that's been extended,\n\n85\n00:04:57.688 --> 00:05:02.830\ngreater functionality, then and\nonly then we can create site collections.\n\n86\n00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.432\nAnd we can see some site collections on\nthe screen there, I wish I could see that.\n\n87\n00:05:08.432 --> 00:05:10.857\nYes, [LAUGH] it's down here as well.\n\n88\n00:05:10.857 --> 00:05:12.122\nWhich tab are we on?\n\n89\n00:05:12.122 --> 00:05:15.164\n>> We are gonna be on the [CROSSTALK]\n>> Okay,\n\n90\n00:05:15.164 --> 00:05:18.688\nwhich is not immediately apparent,\nyes it is!\n\n91\n00:05:18.688 --> 00:05:19.261\nThank you.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n92\n00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:20.378\n>> Okay, so\n\n93\n00:05:20.378 --> 00:05:25.460\nnow we have a variety of site collections.\n\n94\n00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.910\nThree specifically, on this slide.\n\n95\n00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.700\nAnd you can see underneath the intranet,\nand near the top we have an HR site\n\n96\n00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.426\ncollection, marketing site collection,\nand sales site collection.\n\n97\n00:05:37.426 --> 00:05:40.458\nAnd then we can have a variety of\nresources contained within those\n\n98\n00:05:40.458 --> 00:05:43.190\nsite collections,\nlike other sites for example.\n\n99\n00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:49.348\nSo again, these are general diagrams,\nthese aren't cast in stone.\n\n100\n00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:56.713\nThese are possible ways to configure your\nSharePoint environment, if you so choose.\n\n101\n00:05:56.713 --> 00:06:01.570\nAll right, now down below, I'm just\ntrying to get my screen working the way I\n\n102\n00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.430\nwant it to and\nit's not really cooperating.\n\n103\n00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.751\nSo okay, in SharePoint,\nwe use SQL storage,\n\n104\n00:06:09.751 --> 00:06:13.290\nand we have content databases.\n\n105\n00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.920\nSo a site collection,\nwhich is a collection of other sites and\n\n106\n00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.310\nother resources, documents, etc.,\nthat content lives in a SQL database and\n\n107\n00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.970\nwe call it a content database.\n\n108\n00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.310\nYou can move site collections and\n\n109\n00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.220\ntheir associated storage or content,\nlike documents, for example.\n\n110\n00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.169\nYou could move them to\na different content database, but\n\n111\n00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.480\neach site collection's resources can live\nin only one content database at a time.\n\n112\n00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.310\n>> You couldn't divide it up\nbetween multiple databases.\n\n113\n00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.630\n>> Exactly, so\nyou can balance out the total\n\n114\n00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.760\nstorage amongst more than one content\ndatabase, in fact, that's recommended.\n\n115\n00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.910\nBut at any given time,\n\n116\n00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.110\nall the site collection's content must\nlive in a single content database.\n\n117\n00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.950\nNow, in turn,\nwhy would you want more than one?\n\n118\n00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.651\nThe primary driver of content\ndatabase size is not the maximums.\n\n119\n00:07:02.651 --> 00:07:09.613\nAnd by the way, the SharePoint software\nlimits are rather extreme, in other words,\n\n120\n00:07:09.613 --> 00:07:15.719\nyou're highly likely to only bump up\nagainst hardware limits, if at all.\n\n121\n00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:20.348\nIn other words, you're not gonna go\nbeyond typically multi-million sites, for\n\n122\n00:07:20.348 --> 00:07:21.430\nexample.\n\n123\n00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.790\nSo, it's your hardware you\nneed to be concerned about.\n\n124\n00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.660\nSo specifically, in terms of size and\n\n125\n00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:31.550\ncontent databases, the primary driver\nshould be backup and restore time.\n\n126\n00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.890\nMeaning, how long does it take to back up?\n\n127\n00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:38.250\nKnowing that you're probably, if you're\nnot wearing multiple hats, that means you\n\n128\n00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.210\nhave a large organization and\nother people are wearing hats, relating to\n\n129\n00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.620\ndifferent windows for activity to occur\non a daily, weekly, monthly basis.\n\n130\n00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:51.626\nThings like backups, for example,\nor ETL processes with SQL,\n\n131\n00:07:51.626 --> 00:07:55.255\nSQL's integration services, for example.\n\n132\n00:07:55.255 --> 00:07:59.703\nSo you might think well, I'll just put\neverything in one giant content database,\n\n133\n00:07:59.703 --> 00:08:01.110\nI'll back it up nightly.\n\n134\n00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.629\nI don't care if it takes 14 hours.\n\n135\n00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:04.953\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because this content\n\n136\n00:08:04.953 --> 00:08:07.410\ndata base is the only thing that\nmatters in this organization.\n\n137\n00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:08.450\n>> No, it's silly.\n\n138\n00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.320\nIt's going to interfere with other\nwindows of activity, maintenance windows.\n\n139\n00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.740\nSo, you want to.\n\n140\n00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:19.160\nAnd also, it relates to your rpo and\nrto times.\n\n141\n00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.730\nRTO recovery point objective.\n\n142\n00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.110\nso how much data can you live with losing?\n\n143\n00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:29.660\nAnd recovery time objective, how long will\nit take you to recover content, let's say\n\n144\n00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.550\nif a content database goes offline or\nthe disk fries or what have you?\n\n145\n00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.630\nSo the point is, we want multiple\n\n146\n00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.990\nsmaller content databases\nare much easier to deal with.\n\n147\n00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.880\nMaybe you do a full back\nup on each of them.\n\n148\n00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.260\nMaybe if you have seven\ncontent data bases,\n\n149\n00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.140\nyou back up each one in full on\na different day of the week, and then do\n\n150\n00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.950\nsome basic incremental back ups on the\nother days for those content data bases.\n\n151\n00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.700\nMaybe you have a third party solution\ntaking care of your back ups.\n\n152\n00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.210\nMaybe you're backing up to the Cloud.\n\n153\n00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:02.010\nYou've got a lot of options, but with\nthe smaller, more nimble content database.\n\n154\n00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.200\nYou could back faster and\nimportantly you can restore faster\n\n155\n00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.620\nin the event of some kind of\ninadvertent or malicious error.\n\n156\n00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.750\nOkay, so that's my content database spill.\n\n157\n00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.090\nAnd the other concept on\nthis slide that is shown,\n\n158\n00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.810\nit's the concept of zones\nin the bottom right there.\n\n159\n00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:24.900\nSo, A zone is a vector\nto access information.\n\n160\n00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.410\nThankfully we don't have to duplicate,\n\n161\n00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.710\nor recreate well it' snot\nreally recreating the wheel.\n\n162\n00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.480\nWe don't have to duplicate data for\ndifferent audiences.\n\n163\n00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.500\nFor example if I'm currently logged\nin within the firewall I can just\n\n164\n00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.250\nuse HTTP://intranet If I\nset it up that way.\n\n165\n00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:47.250\nWere as someone accessing from\noutside the organization and\n\n166\n00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.200\nthey're multiple zones you can have\nwould use a different url, but\n\n167\n00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.880\nthey be accessing the exact same content.\n\n168\n00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.290\nI could also filter restrict what\nthat person could see accessing\n\n169\n00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:00.750\nthrough another vector.\n\n170\n00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.170\nOr another zone.\n\n171\n00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:05.620\nBut the point is, I don't have to\nhave duplicates, or triplicates, or\n\n172\n00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.990\nquadruplicates.\n\n173\n00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.020\nIs that a word?\n>> I think so.\n\n174\n00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:08.940\n>> Yeah. I think so. >> It is now.\n\n175\n00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.355\n>> How about quintuplicates,\nbecause you can have up to five zones.\n\n176\n00:10:11.355 --> 00:10:14.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You don't have to recreate that content\n\n177\n00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.570\nfor different audience types say,\nwell that's\n\n178\n00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.320\nnot the right word because audiences\nrefers to something else in SharePoint.\n\n179\n00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.880\nBut for different populations that\nwould need access to the data,\n\n180\n00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.390\nin other words customers, suppliers\n>> Contractors,\n\n181\n00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:32.510\nfull time employees, they can all access\nthe same content, different ways.\n\n182\n00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.730\nAnd using different authentication\nmechanisms potentially, as well,\n\n183\n00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:36.950\nif you want.\n\n184\n00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.170\nSo that's what we mean\nwhen we talk about zones.\n\n185\n00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.500\nJust a different way,\nto access the same content.\n\n186\n00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.490\nLet's move on to another slide.\n\n187\n00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.370\nWhat's next up in your-\n>> My sites, maybe?\n\n188\n00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:49.200\n>> Yeah, my sites.\n\n189\n00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:56.250\nOkay, so my sites you may recall, ooh,\nI just moved something around there.\n\n190\n00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.680\nYou may recall from another episode.\n\n191\n00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.880\nFor some people, my sites is one of\nthe primary drivers, in other words,\n\n192\n00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.530\none of the main reasons they're\ninvesting in SharePoint.\n\n193\n00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:09.020\nMy sites, it's like giving everyone\ntheir own personal site collection\n\n194\n00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:13.420\nwhere they're the boss and they can\ncontrol who has access to what content.\n\n195\n00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.960\nIn terms of collaboration,\n\n196\n00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.520\nexposing information about themselves that\ngoes way beyond Active Directory Field.\n\n197\n00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.420\nSome talk about things like hobbies,\nskill sets,\n\n198\n00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.640\nprojects worked on\n>> Maybe areas of the world lived in.\n\n199\n00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:33.200\nSo it's sad that maybe three-quarters of\nwhat it takes to run a business is not\n\n200\n00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.000\nlisted anywhere,\nnot written down anywhere.\n\n201\n00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.750\nIt's going around the people's heads,\nemployees' heads.\n\n202\n00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.320\nSo how can we surface\nsome of that information?\n\n203\n00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.040\nI mean the greatest search\ntechnology in the world.\n\n204\n00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.510\nCan only search what data exists.\n\n205\n00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.420\nRight?\nIt's hard to probe someone's mind.\n\n206\n00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.989\nalthough, and others I'm sure they're\nworking on that- to read thoughts.\n\n207\n00:11:51.989 --> 00:11:54.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's not as far fetched as\n\n208\n00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:55.700\nit used to be.\n\n209\n00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:00.220\nBut, so how can we help users\nfind resources in the company?\n\n210\n00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.661\nespecially if you're firm,\n\n211\n00:12:02.661 --> 00:12:06.650\nyou might not meet in person most of\nthe people you have to collaborate with,\n\n212\n00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:10.560\nmaybe have a little video conference, but\nit's not the same as meeting them live.\n\n213\n00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.525\nAnd you still want to benefit from\nsomeone's expertise potentially.\n\n214\n00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:15.790\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Well, it's the kind of thing,\n\n215\n00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:16.540\nit's a network effect.\n\n216\n00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.680\nRight?\nThe more people buy into it and\n\n217\n00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.580\nexpose information about\nwhat their expertise is\n\n218\n00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.180\nthe more resourceful they'll be for\nothers in the company.\n\n219\n00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:30.090\nHowever, it can be a double edged sword\nbecause if only some people are willing to\n\n220\n00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:34.280\nshare their expertise and\nbe contacted as a resource.\n\n221\n00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:38.020\nAnd others are not,\nthen that presumably could take away from\n\n222\n00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.880\nthe user's primary reason for being in\nthe company, or what they're hired to do.\n\n223\n00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.790\n>> Right.\n\n224\n00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:45.190\nBut again, if everyone participates or\n\n225\n00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:49.470\nthe more people participate the more\nresourceful you can be come.\n\n226\n00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.330\nAnd again, not having to recreate data\n\n227\n00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.580\nthat you didn't know\nsomeone had the expertise.\n\n228\n00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:59.270\nor maybe had already created the document\nthat has the information you needed.\n\n229\n00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:03.590\n>> And I know Mark you say that some\npeople this is their driving reason\n\n230\n00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.250\nfor going to SharePoint\n>> Do you have the other end\n\n231\n00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:06.770\nof the spectrum?\n\n232\n00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.730\nCuz when you say I'm gonna\ngive everybody in my company\n\n233\n00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:15.210\ntheir own SharePoint collection\nI'm freaking out, I get worried.\n\n234\n00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.685\n>> He's freaking out here!\n\n235\n00:13:16.685 --> 00:13:19.390\n>> [LAUGH] I'm like gosh\nwhat are my users gonna do?\n\n236\n00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:23.040\n>> Well you've perfectly illustrated\nthe other side of the equation,\n\n237\n00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:28.150\nwhich is\n>> The lack of control so Sharepoint\n\n238\n00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:33.930\nif you want to super lock down,\nno freedom, do it this way, it's the only\n\n239\n00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.840\nway kind of environment Sharepoint is\nprobably not the software for you.\n\n240\n00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:43.750\nSo as IT admins and people involved\nin governance we all decide.\n\n241\n00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.790\nWhat the guard rails are.\n\n242\n00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.000\nSo we keep people on the road, as it were.\n\n243\n00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.990\nBut there has to be,\nanother metaphor, is a sandbox.\n\n244\n00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:53.500\nAll right, you have to let people play,\nand learn and experiment, and\n\n245\n00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.710\nmake mistakes, on their own.\n\n246\n00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:59.330\nSo, having my sites, and people's own site\ncollections, which they're the master of,\n\n247\n00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:03.220\nthey can experiment in an environment\nthat's not gonna negatively impact others.\n\n248\n00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:08.690\nHaving said that, It's the lack\nof control, which you alluded to,\n\n249\n00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:13.910\nand not knowing, and maybe having\nissues with quotas or runaway storage.\n\n250\n00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.800\nMaybe some liability issues because there\nmight be some inappropriate content\n\n251\n00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.060\nthat is exposed to some users.\n\n252\n00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:25.250\nI can see there's certainly an argument\nto be made to not enable the My Sites\n\n253\n00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:30.770\nfunctionality, and there's so much other\ngood stuff available and useful technology\n\n254\n00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:35.850\nat SharePoint, that if you never touch\nmy site you can still get great benefit.\n\n255\n00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:37.900\n>> Right.\n>> But there's definitely two sides\n\n256\n00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.860\nthere that have equal valid claims.\n\n257\n00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.330\nAll right, and so my sites.\n\n258\n00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.030\nYeah, we're gonna call\nin the databases there.\n\n259\n00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.610\nThat's all I wanna say on that slide.\n\n260\n00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.460\n>> All right.\nAnd we got team sites, maybe next?\n\n261\n00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.470\n>> All right.\nTeam sites.\n\n262\n00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:57.060\nSo when I gave you that sandbox metaphor,\npeople can still play and learn, and\n\n263\n00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:02.470\nhave experimental sites which nobody\nhas to see in a team site context.\n\n264\n00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:06.310\nSo you don't have to set up my sites\njust for the sandbox approach.\n\n265\n00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.240\nYou can do that in any Context.\n\n266\n00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.970\nSo team sites is a way to get\na quick win in SharePoint.\n\n267\n00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.010\nLet's say you wanna just get\nsome functionality going, and\n\n268\n00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:16.810\nlet people collaborate.\n\n269\n00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:18.730\nMaybe there's some\ncalendaring functionality.\n\n270\n00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.750\nMaybe you wanna,\nwho's bringing what for the picnic.\n\n271\n00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:26.640\nAnnouncements, new hire,\nnews that's relevant to your division.\n\n272\n00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:31.410\nOr departments, these are good,\napplications of team sites.\n\n273\n00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:34.940\nSo when we say team sites,\nremember there's all kinds of\n\n274\n00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.350\ntemplates available to us in SharePoint,\nright out of the box.\n\n275\n00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.250\nSo you don't have to\nstart with a blank page,\n\n276\n00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.830\njust like an author,\nstaring at a blank page, right?\n\n277\n00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:43.337\nHe can,\n>> Yes.\n\n278\n00:15:43.337 --> 00:15:43.979\nFreeze your brain.\n\n279\n00:15:43.979 --> 00:15:44.553\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n280\n00:15:44.553 --> 00:15:46.720\n>> No, there's templates which\n\n281\n00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.554\nare a suggest- essentially a suggested\narrangement of web parts and\n\n282\n00:15:51.554 --> 00:15:54.990\nbranding.\nSo the top part of screen and the right\n\n283\n00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:59.741\nhand side Sorry, the left-hand side.\nI was thinking how to translate that to\n\n284\n00:15:59.741 --> 00:16:01.271\nyou all-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n285\n00:16:01.271 --> 00:16:02.231\n>> While looking at myself\n\n286\n00:16:02.231 --> 00:16:03.680\nin the monitor, awkward.\n\n287\n00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.226\nAnyway, you have to be somewhat dyslexic,\nI suppose, or the opposite.\n\n288\n00:16:07.226 --> 00:16:09.125\n>> Thinking about one of my last guests,\nAdam Gordon,\n\n289\n00:16:09.125 --> 00:16:11.629\ntalked about getting some turn signal\nlike blinkers to put up there so\n\n290\n00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:13.800\nhe could figure out whether left\nis right and right is left.\n\n291\n00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.820\n>> Yeah, okay, so I'll-\n>> Yeah.\n\n292\n00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.735\n[LAUGH]\n>> Or is it L?\n\n293\n00:16:17.735 --> 00:16:20.875\nAnyway, I had a point which\nI totally forgot now.\n\n294\n00:16:20.875 --> 00:16:23.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We were talking about the team size.\n\n295\n00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.040\nWe got the databases there.\n\n296\n00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:31.690\nSo it seems like my sites are more like,\nobviously, for individuals, and then\n\n297\n00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:36.290\nwe just step it up a notch, team sites,\nnot everybody, but a group of individuals.\n\n298\n00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.630\nMaybe this would be departments?\n\n299\n00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.620\n>> Yeah, departmental.\n\n300\n00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.546\nI remember, after interrupting myself,\nI remember what I meant now,\n\n301\n00:16:42.546 --> 00:16:44.270\nwhat I was on about, which is templates.\n\n302\n00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.641\nSo, there's a team site template.\n\n303\n00:16:45.641 --> 00:16:47.917\nThere's sites for projects.\n\n304\n00:16:47.917 --> 00:16:52.590\nThere's sites for a document center,\npublishing site templates.\n\n305\n00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:57.510\nSo we have some that are so-called\nEnterprise templates like search center,\n\n306\n00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:01.970\nfor example, and others\nare collaboration or document workspace.\n\n307\n00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:07.030\nSo that's a template that's designed to\nhelp people collaborate on a document.\n\n308\n00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:11.220\nNow there's a lot of customization\navailable in SharePoint.\n\n309\n00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.930\nSo there are a lot of themes\nyou could choose from.\n\n310\n00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.720\nWhen I say themes,\nthink of branding, colors, fonts.\n\n311\n00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.300\nBut you can absolutely\nmodify any default themes or\n\n312\n00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.780\nsite templates and make them your own.\n\n313\n00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.379\nSo save them as a new name.\n\n314\n00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.490\nBy the way, any customizations,\nin general, the rule of thumb is\n\n315\n00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:34.960\nsave them in a different directory than\nwhatever you modified in the first place.\n\n316\n00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.050\nWhy?\nBecause, well,\n\n317\n00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.100\nlet's say it's service pack time.\n\n318\n00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.860\nWhat typically happens when service\npacks get installed is that\n\n319\n00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.920\ndefault directory gets cleared out and\nthen reloaded with new contents.\n\n320\n00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.700\nSo all your customizations\nwould be thrown out and\n\n321\n00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.660\nlost to you if you save them\nin the default location.\n\n322\n00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.045\nI mean, I don't code the product.\n\n323\n00:17:53.045 --> 00:17:54.820\nIt's not necessarily the way\nI would have done it,\n\n324\n00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.350\nbut the point is-\n>> Valuable point there because you spend\n\n325\n00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.100\na lot of time on those customizations and\n\n326\n00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.895\nthen you think you're\ndoing the right thing.\n\n327\n00:18:00.895 --> 00:18:03.200\nYou're running an update on it and\nthen all of a sudden everything is gone.\n\n328\n00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:03.805\nI hate it when that happens.\n\n329\n00:18:03.805 --> 00:18:04.746\n>> Yeah.\n\n330\n00:18:04.746 --> 00:18:05.722\n>> Not cool.\n\n331\n00:18:05.722 --> 00:18:08.806\nRemember Bill G at Microsoft, no,\nhe doesn't work there anymore.\n\n332\n00:18:08.806 --> 00:18:14.367\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> SatyaN@Microsoft.com.\n\n333\n00:18:14.367 --> 00:18:19.802\nOkay, so that's it for team sites.\n\n334\n00:18:19.802 --> 00:18:22.269\n>> We've got research or\nweb application research.\n\n335\n00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:23.987\n>> Let's go research.\n\n336\n00:18:28.805 --> 00:18:31.545\nOkay so, there's nothing really rather\nthan giving our research compared\n\n337\n00:18:31.545 --> 00:18:32.600\nto the team sites.\n\n338\n00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.010\nHowever, keep in mind you have a lot\nof control in terms of permissions.\n\n339\n00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:41.228\nIn other words, who gets access to\nwhat in your SharePoint environment.\n\n340\n00:18:41.228 --> 00:18:46.552\nThere's no convenient tool, by the way,\nto enumerate permissions for a single\n\n341\n00:18:46.552 --> 00:18:52.140\nuser across the farm, so you might wanna\nlook at a third party tool for that.\n\n342\n00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.272\nFor example, let's say a contractor's\nfinished his contract, or\n\n343\n00:18:55.272 --> 00:18:58.031\nmaybe you had to let someone go,\nin other words, fire them.\n\n344\n00:18:58.031 --> 00:19:00.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It might be useful to know, okay,\n\n345\n00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:04.870\nyou're gonna do things like disable or\neliminate their Active Directory account.\n\n346\n00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.980\nIt'd be still useful to know what\npermissions that user account has, or had,\n\n347\n00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:14.390\non your farm, so you can make sure you've\nremoved any lingering permissions.\n\n348\n00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.450\nOr this a way to audit for\nexisting employees.\n\n349\n00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:20.380\nMaybe someone got granted\npermission they should not have.\n\n350\n00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.240\nAnd without a third party tool,\n\n351\n00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.760\nit can be laborious to go through\nsite collection by site collection.\n\n352\n00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.500\nEven if you script it,\nit can be a, laborious and\n\n353\n00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.720\nb, less than totally accurate.\n\n354\n00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:36.000\nSo it's good to know for across the entire\nfarm cuz you might end up with thousands\n\n355\n00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.190\nof site collections, tens of thousands\nof sub-sites and other resources.\n\n356\n00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.480\nTough to know.\n\n357\n00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.058\nThere's no farm-wide baked in\nfunctionality to determine for\n\n358\n00:19:45.058 --> 00:19:48.976\na given user account what they can\naccess across the farm, all right.\n\n359\n00:19:48.976 --> 00:19:50.114\n>> Extranet.\n\n360\n00:19:50.114 --> 00:19:51.356\n>> Extranet.\n\n361\n00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:53.422\nOkay, so remember, we can set up for\n\n362\n00:19:53.422 --> 00:19:57.825\ncollaboration with partner organizations\nso they can get access to some of our\n\n363\n00:19:57.825 --> 00:20:02.630\nSharePoint deployment without having any\naccess or even knowing about the existence\n\n364\n00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.790\nof any other resources in\nthe SharePoint environment.\n\n365\n00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.700\nSo that's very handy.\n\n366\n00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.840\nYou don't necessarily wanna grant\nthem Active Directory permissions.\n\n367\n00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.260\nAnd there's ways of setting up trusts\nbetween different environments\n\n368\n00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.790\nto allow those external partner or\n\n369\n00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:21.631\nvendor organizations just enough access\nto a part of your SharePoint environment.\n\n370\n00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:26.361\n>> And last but not least,\nwe've got our company Internet site.\n\n371\n00:20:26.361 --> 00:20:29.741\n>> Yeah, so often, you might\nthink that wow, anonymous access,\n\n372\n00:20:29.741 --> 00:20:31.000\nhow could that secure?\n\n373\n00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.200\nBut if it's a customer or Internet\nfacing site, that would be totally fine.\n\n374\n00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.780\nYou wouldn't expect just\nsomeone perusing your products.\n\n375\n00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:38.651\nThey have to log in.\n\n376\n00:20:38.651 --> 00:20:41.147\nIn fact, it's totally annoying\nwhen you go to websites, and\n\n377\n00:20:41.147 --> 00:20:42.640\nthey do require your details.\n\n378\n00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.449\nThey haven't given you anything yet\nand they want something from you.\n\n379\n00:20:45.449 --> 00:20:47.388\nIt's like, well, I won't go there.\n\n380\n00:20:47.388 --> 00:20:50.565\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Anyway, so it's, so\n\n381\n00:20:50.565 --> 00:20:54.237\nanonymous access can\nbe totally legitimate,\n\n382\n00:20:54.237 --> 00:20:59.520\na legitimate way of providing access\nto a part of your deployment.\n\n383\n00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.780\nAnd the great thing about SharePoint,\none of the great things, is you can have\n\n384\n00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:07.415\nthe same as opposed to other solutions\nwhere you might have a separate vendor for\n\n385\n00:21:07.415 --> 00:21:11.870\nyour intranet compared to you externet,\nand your Internet-facing sites.\n\n386\n00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:15.840\nWith SharePoint you can use the same\ntechnology for all three of those\n\n387\n00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:21.320\napplications, in terms of sites,\nso that's very handy.\n\n388\n00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:27.040\nAnd maybe there is a part of your Internet\nsite that does require log-in for\n\n389\n00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:27.720\ndeeper access.\n\n390\n00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.693\nYou know maybe some customer resources,\nwhereas if I'm a potential customer I get\n\n391\n00:21:31.693 --> 00:21:34.091\naccess to maybe some white\npapers I can download.\n\n392\n00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:39.038\nAnd there might be some deeper\nresources available to customers only,\n\n393\n00:21:39.038 --> 00:21:44.080\nin which case they can log in, or\njust enter their user account details.\n\n394\n00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:49.330\n>> So, really flexible in the different\nways that we can set it up, depending on\n\n395\n00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:53.900\nwhat it is we're trying to accomplish, and\nalso very obvious that we can segregate.\n\n396\n00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:58.850\nAnd we can make content available to\ncertain groups of people, certain teams,\n\n397\n00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:03.250\ncertain vendors without compromising\nthe security on our other resources.\n\n398\n00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.240\n>> Right, and very flexible, too, Mike.\n\n399\n00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.130\nSo in the old days,\n\n400\n00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:12.280\nas we mentioned, it was very\ninflexible and rigid architecture.\n\n401\n00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.830\nSo you really had to know in\nadvance what you wanted for\n\n402\n00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.400\nthe life of your SharePoint deployment.\n\n403\n00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.940\nAnd, it made sense to start from scratch,\n\n404\n00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.540\nif you wanted to make any\narchitecture changes.\n\n405\n00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.580\nNowadays, we're well beyond that,\nthankfully.\n\n406\n00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.930\nSo, it's very flexible.\n\n407\n00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:30.070\nIf you wanna provision a new web\napplication, create a new site collection,\n\n408\n00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:34.030\ndelete a site collection, total\nflexibility, and that's a beautiful thing.\n\n409\n00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:36.516\nWe'll be showing a lot of those\nsettings as we go through the week.\n\n410\n00:22:36.516 --> 00:22:37.639\n>> I remember that.\n\n411\n00:22:37.639 --> 00:22:40.950\nI think I first started playing with\nSharePoint back in 2003, I think it was.\n\n412\n00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:44.430\nAnd it was that warning at\nthe very beginning of the install\n\n413\n00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:48.330\nthat really kinda got you a little\nworried or intimidated, I guess,\n\n414\n00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.510\nbecause it said,\nyou've gotta make this decision.\n\n415\n00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.940\nAre you going to do a farm or are you\ngoing to do a single server deployment?\n\n416\n00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:57.170\nBy the way,\nyou can't change this once you've done.\n\n417\n00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:00.050\nAnd so, you're like, whoa, wait,\nI don't wanna click anything just yet.\n\n418\n00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:02.580\nSo it did require a lot of\nresearch ahead of time.\n\n419\n00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.490\nSo it's nice that they've given\nus the ability to make changes\n\n420\n00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:08.350\nif we start out with a single server and\nwe wanna move to a farm.\n\n421\n00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.010\nIt makes it easier for us to do that.\n\n422\n00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:11.640\n>> Definitely, definitely.\n\n423\n00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.650\nSo that leaves us with\nthe physical architecture.\n\n424\n00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:15.920\nSo, everything we've\ntalked about is logical.\n\n425\n00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.110\nLet's talk about some of the physical.\n\n426\n00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:20.440\nAnd again,\nthis is one suggested way to go.\n\n427\n00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.930\nIt's certainly not the final\nword in physical design, but\n\n428\n00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:26.440\nit's a place to start.\n\n429\n00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.010\nAll right, so we can see here\na few sections of screen there.\n\n430\n00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:33.010\nWe've got a threat management gateway,\nor firewall,\n\n431\n00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:37.210\nright in the middle near the top, and on\nthe left-hand side, a perimeter network.\n\n432\n00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:40.280\nSo where vendors or\ncustomers could access and\n\n433\n00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.492\ninside the firewall our corporate\nnetwork over on the right.\n\n434\n00:23:43.492 --> 00:23:48.836\nNotice that we have Active Directory and\nDNS internally and a couple of SQL boxes.\n\n435\n00:23:48.836 --> 00:23:52.405\nIt's always good to mirror the SQL\nback in if you have the budget for it.\n\n436\n00:23:52.405 --> 00:23:56.214\nYou need at least a separate SQL box,\nwhen I say box,\n\n437\n00:23:56.214 --> 00:23:59.257\nthat could physical or virtual machine.\n\n438\n00:23:59.257 --> 00:24:02.088\nMirroring SQL back end is great for\nperformance reasons.\n\n439\n00:24:02.088 --> 00:24:07.680\nYou also wanna have high, at least gigabit\nethernet connections with low latency,\n\n440\n00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.260\nless than a millisecond for\nbest performance.\n\n441\n00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.795\nThere's a lot of IO, there's a lot\nof back and forthing between,\n\n442\n00:24:12.795 --> 00:24:16.070\ncuz all the content in share point\nis stored in the SQL back end.\n\n443\n00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.480\nI mean there might be some file stream\nreferences to video content say sort of\n\n444\n00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.460\nthe file system, but generally almost\nall the contents in SQL, a lot of\n\n445\n00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:29.140\ncommunication back and forth between\nactive directory, DNS and the SQL boxes.\n\n446\n00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:33.230\nOpen the perimeter network, okay so,\nclimb machines never interact\n\n447\n00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.810\ndirectly with SQL in the back end or\neven applications servers, no,\n\n448\n00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:40.690\nclimb machines always go through\na web front end server or WFE.\n\n449\n00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:45.240\nIt's good too, for performance, load\nbalancing, and high availability reasons\n\n450\n00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:50.100\nto have at least two, preferably three or\nmore web front end servers.\n\n451\n00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.690\nAnd because of the flex of architecture,\nyou can start small,\n\n452\n00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:56.060\nadd more functionality to your\nSharePoint deployment and\n\n453\n00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:01.040\nas expected demand increases then its\neasy to provision additional roles.\n\n454\n00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:06.530\nEspecially nowadays, in the SharePoint\n2016 environment where more improvements\n\n455\n00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:11.490\nhave happened, in terms of not having\nto reboot your servers after patching.\n\n456\n00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.750\nSo, again, higher availability,\navailable to you.\n\n457\n00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:18.290\nSo, we've got, a variety of web\nfront end service here, for,\n\n458\n00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.650\nyou can see it in the upper left there,\nIntranet.acme.com.\n\n459\n00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:25.570\nAnd other web servers, or sorry,\nweb front end servers, for our Acme.com.\n\n460\n00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:31.932\nSo perhaps a customer\nfacing Internet presence.\n\n461\n00:25:31.932 --> 00:25:35.820\nAnd that is all I've got to say on.\n\n462\n00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.620\nSorry, one more thing,\napplication servers.\n\n463\n00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.450\nSo.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n464\n00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.250\n>> We can have a three tier environment\nfact larger organizations will definitely\n\n465\n00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.810\nprobably start off with\na three tier environment,\n\n466\n00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:47.930\nwhere you've got web front end\nservers that interact with clients,\n\n467\n00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:51.600\ntake LAN request, serve back content and\n\n468\n00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:57.580\napplication servers can more specialize\nto run a certain workloads and\n\n469\n00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:02.405\nthen in the back end, now we got our\nSQL preferable mirror SQL databases.\n\n470\n00:26:02.405 --> 00:26:05.335\nNow, you don't require\na dedicated SQL box.\n\n471\n00:26:05.335 --> 00:26:08.585\nIt could be an instance on\na SQL server that's mirrored.\n\n472\n00:26:08.585 --> 00:26:13.455\nAlthough, if you can dedicate one or two\nSQL boxes to your SharePoint deployment,\n\n473\n00:26:13.455 --> 00:26:15.325\nthat would definitely be preferred.\n\n474\n00:26:15.325 --> 00:26:17.705\nSolid State Drives, again,\nif you got the budget for\n\n475\n00:26:17.705 --> 00:26:20.420\nit, huge increases in performance.\n\n476\n00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:24.260\nBecause we're measuring read or\nwrite times in microseconds instead of\n\n477\n00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:27.630\nmilliseconds, nothing physical moving,\nso that's the way we're going.\n\n478\n00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:33.220\nAlso, if you can't quite afford to go all\nSolid State Drives for your workload,\n\n479\n00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:37.990\nhybrid drives are a nice compromise where\nyou have some solid state storage and\n\n480\n00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.220\nsome traditional spinning physical disks.\n\n481\n00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:45.020\nAnd with server 2012,\nthen now the server 2012 r2 in 2016.\n\n482\n00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.830\nThey're smart enough to prioritize and\n\n483\n00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.970\nshift workload so\nthe most recently accessed or\n\n484\n00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:54.350\nmost likely to be accessed content is kept\non the faster solid state storage, and\n\n485\n00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:59.590\nthe less frequently accessed content is\nshunted to the slower physical drives.\n\n486\n00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:01.979\n>> Yeah, I like those storage\ntiers in our storage pools.\n\n487\n00:27:01.979 --> 00:27:03.200\nThat's fantastic.\n\n488\n00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.532\n>> Yeah, indeed.\nSo, that's all I got.\n\n489\n00:27:05.532 --> 00:27:07.540\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right Mark, well I tell you what.\n\n490\n00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.220\nIt's again a lot of information, but\n\n491\n00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.610\na really good look at what\nwe've got going on as far as.\n\n492\n00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:15.080\nOr what we can do I guess\nis a better way to say it,\n\n493\n00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.350\nwith our SharePoint environment.\n\n494\n00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:20.760\nAgain a lot of planning goes into\nsuccessfully deploying SharePoint.\n\n495\n00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.670\nYou've gotta understand what\nis it that I need to do?\n\n496\n00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:26.940\nAm I just supporting internal users and\nsetting up my pages for\n\n497\n00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:31.340\nthem or my sites for them,\nto share information among each other or\n\n498\n00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.760\nam I setting this up so that we can\nwork with a partner organisation?\n\n499\n00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.470\nOr do I have contractors that I\nwanna make information available to?\n\n500\n00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.176\nDo I wanna use it for my website,\n\n501\n00:27:40.176 --> 00:27:43.690\nmy actual public-facing website\nthat my customers visit?\n\n502\n00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:44.560\nOr do I wanna do all of that?\n\n503\n00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.160\nRight?\nSo, we really gotta plan out what it is\n\n504\n00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.790\nwe're gonna need to do,\nbecause that's gonna change or\n\n505\n00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:55.010\nimpact our decisions that we make down\nthe road as we actually implement\n\n506\n00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:59.190\nSharePoint 2016, which is what we're\ngetting ready to do pretty soon.\n\n507\n00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.930\nSo, we thank you for that Mark.\n\n508\n00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:03.880\nA lot of great information there,\nhopefully that helped you guys out and\n\n509\n00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.940\nyou enjoyed watching.\n\n510\n00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:08.160\nBut for now, signing out for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n511\n00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:08.780\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n512\n00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:09.815\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n513\n00:28:09.815 --> 00:28:18.660\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:20.480\nI'm your host Mike Roddick and today\nwe're going to be doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.028\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ncontinuing on with our planning phase and\n\n5\n00:00:25.028 --> 00:00:27.281\nour deployment of SharePoint 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:30.574\nNow we're gonna take a look\nat the physical architecture\n\n7\n00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:35.378\ndesign considerations when we're talking\nabout the physical architecture of our\n\n8\n00:00:35.378 --> 00:00:37.100\nSharePoint deployment.\n\n9\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.810\nAnd here to help us with that, of course,\nis Mr. Mark Ingram, how's it going Mark?\n\n10\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.250\n>> Thanks, MIke, good to be back.\n\n11\n00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.750\nOkay, so in the previous episode we\nlooked at some of the logical design\n\n12\n00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.350\nconsiderations that you must address\nbefore deploying SharePoint,\n\n13\n00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.940\nor before upgrading,\nor pay the price later.\n\n14\n00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.530\nNow, based on the results of\nyour notes that you've taken and\n\n15\n00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.930\ndiscussions you've had and decisions\ntaken regarding your logical design,\n\n16\n00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.690\nthat will naturally lead to, and\ninform your physical design.\n\n17\n00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.370\nSo if it's just some\nbasic test environment,\n\n18\n00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.430\nthen maybe you can install\neverything on one server.\n\n19\n00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.770\nWhen I say server,\n\n20\n00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.290\nyou can interchange physical server\nwith virtual machine, either or is fine.\n\n21\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.820\nNow in a production environment typically\nyou're going to have multiple servers\n\n22\n00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.890\ndepending on your budget for\nlicensing and hardware,\n\n23\n00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.150\nthere'll be some compelling reasons to\nchose at least a two server design.\n\n24\n00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.380\nSo, at least a SharePoint server and\na SQL database in the backend.\n\n25\n00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.580\nTypically in production though you're\ngoing to mirror your back end, SQL box and\n\n26\n00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.780\nprobably have redundancy at every level so\nyour web front end servers,\n\n27\n00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.050\nyour application servers,\nif any, more is more.\n\n28\n00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.690\nIn terms of specific hardware you're\ngoing to look at, realistically,\n\n29\n00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.240\nat least 16 gigs of RAM,\n24 would be better.\n\n30\n00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.170\nOf course everything's 64 bit nowadays,\neight core wold be good,\n\n31\n00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.230\nagain it depends if it's just\na test environment or production.\n\n32\n00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.990\nAnd if you forget or go cheap don't worry,\nyour users will remind you.\n\n33\n00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.080\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yes we will.\n\n34\n00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.370\n>> With helpdesk calls like this\npage is taking 18 seconds to load.\n\n35\n00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.860\n>> Yeah SharePoint does like\nits resources doesn't it.\n\n36\n00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.900\n>> It is a hog, [LAUGH] A beast,\nif you will, you must feed the beast.\n\n37\n00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.250\nSo depending on your architecture you\nmay be able to plug in more cores,\n\n38\n00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.870\nmore RAM and that's good.\n\n39\n00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.900\nSo it's a good idea to plan for a year or\ntwo out what you expect capacity to be.\n\n40\n00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.440\nSo you may just be dipping your\ntoe in the water of SharePoint,\n\n41\n00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.940\ntrying some site collections if you're new\nto product or even if you're upgrading,\n\n42\n00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.920\nand we'll look at specific\nupgrade considerations shortly.\n\n43\n00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.980\nBut even if you're upgrading, or new,\nyou're probably going to expand your\n\n44\n00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.740\nfootprint of resources\nSharePoint consumes.\n\n45\n00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.540\nYou might add on additional functionality\nor turn that on or enable it by enabling\n\n46\n00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.287\nfeatures and setting up Record Center for\nexample, Enterprise Search Center,\n\n47\n00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:12.810\nmore intranet sites, maybe some line of\nbusiness software you're integrating or\n\n48\n00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.960\naccessing from SharePoint,\nadditional work flows, etc.\n\n49\n00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.835\nSo the point is, as word gets out,\n\n50\n00:03:17.835 --> 00:03:20.200\nwith your successful with\nSharePoint deployment, and\n\n51\n00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.490\nthere's more demand to utilize SharePoint\nfor various work flows or processes,\n\n52\n00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.120\nthe demand is gonna go up on your RAM and\nCPU usage.\n\n53\n00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.260\nSo you want to, even if you're\nnot gonna start off with, say,\n\n54\n00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.950\n24 gigs of RAM, maybe you're starting with\n16, if you have available capacity, or\n\n55\n00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.990\nif you're running it all on\na virtualized environment,\n\n56\n00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.800\nif your host servers have available\ncapacity to upgrade, that's a good thing.\n\n57\n00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.280\nWhat you don't want is to get bind from\nyour users to do various processes,\n\n58\n00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.700\nenjoy document collaboration for\nexample, search,\n\n59\n00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.970\nupdating product lists, extranet,\ncollaborating with partners, and\n\n60\n00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.020\nthen find the performance\nslowly degrading over time.\n\n61\n00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.840\nThat would be a bad thing.\n\n62\n00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.170\nYou wanna always keep in mind that\nyou're in service of your users,\n\n63\n00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.620\nwhether they're internal and or External.\n\n64\n00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.700\nSo plan for what you expect capacity\nto be a year or two down the road and\n\n65\n00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.650\nyou're probably underestimate it,\nbut you gotta start somewhere.\n\n66\n00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.100\nWhich brings up another point, in terms of\nmonitoring your physical infrastructure\n\n67\n00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.550\nand how your software is running,\nsystem center operations manager, or\n\n68\n00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.330\nSCOM, used to be MOM, or Microsoft\noperations manager, is a great tool.\n\n69\n00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.750\nThere are third party tools\nyou could use as well but\n\n70\n00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.110\nrather than you having to\nmanually scour event logs and\n\n71\n00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.690\ndesign your own counters and\nmaybe some alerts,\n\n72\n00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.520\nwouldn't it be better to utilize the know\nhow of the SharePoint developers?\n\n73\n00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.550\nSo, who better than them to know\nwhat thresholds are important,\n\n74\n00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.115\nwhat settings to monitor, what\ncorrective action to take automatically,\n\n75\n00:04:53.115 --> 00:04:55.530\nthan the people coding the product.\n\n76\n00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.520\nSo system center is a framework,\nyou load in operations manager and\n\n77\n00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.520\nyou load in management pact's\ndepending what you're monitoring,\n\n78\n00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.340\nwhether it's Windows Server, SQL server,\nwhich is a big point of SharePoint,\n\n79\n00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.410\nvarious SharePoint server rules,\nother server technology,\n\n80\n00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.820\nthere's even management packs for\nDell hardware, HP hardware.\n\n81\n00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.450\nSo it's not just Microsoft\nsoftware you can monitor\n\n82\n00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.430\nfrom within\nSystem Center Operation Manager,\n\n83\n00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.110\nthe point is we wanna be proactively\nalerted well in advance.\n\n84\n00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.560\nSo we make an alert for example,\nyou're running low on disk space and\n\n85\n00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.470\nthen you can see that in three months for\nexample,\n\n86\n00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.980\nif usage growth continues you're\ngonna run out of storage space.\n\n87\n00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.570\nIt's better to find this out in\nadvance when you have some time and\n\n88\n00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.800\nbudget to plan for upgrading versus,\n\n89\n00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.410\nwe just ran out of storage space and then\nthere's something that got disconnected.\n\n90\n00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.480\n>> Everything stops and yeah not good.\n\n91\n00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.430\n>> Not good.\n\n92\n00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.300\nOr maybe you decided we don't have any\nhardware budget until fiscal 20 XX,\n\n93\n00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.350\nso we have to start implementing quotas or\nperhaps restrict the file types that we\n\n94\n00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.260\nallow in our SharePoint environment, but\nthe point is you wanna know in advance.\n\n95\n00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.009\nOr maybe it's your CPU usage\nthat's pinning over 95% and\n\n96\n00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.718\nyou wouldn't necessarily know.\n\n97\n00:06:09.718 --> 00:06:13.662\nYou might get the odd user complaint but\nif you can see this and\n\n98\n00:06:13.662 --> 00:06:18.841\nit throws up an alert, based on rules in\na manager pack for SharePoint then again\n\n99\n00:06:18.841 --> 00:06:23.635\nyou can be proactive, you can investigate\nmaybe at some shotty web part or\n\n100\n00:06:23.635 --> 00:06:29.420\nsome poor third party tool, that you may\nhave acquired that is the resource hog.\n\n101\n00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.004\nSo it gives you information\nyou can use in advance,\n\n102\n00:06:32.004 --> 00:06:35.470\nit's always better to know in\nadvance rather than after the fact.\n\n103\n00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.056\nSo that's my pitch for\nSystems Center Operations Manager.\n\n104\n00:06:38.056 --> 00:06:39.650\n>> [LAUGH] Microsoft thanks you for that.\n\n105\n00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.836\n>> See the link at\nthe bottom of your screen.\n\n106\n00:06:41.836 --> 00:06:45.260\n[LAUGH] Hey, they say in remnant,\nif you're not writing code,\n\n107\n00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.940\nyou're selling code, so since we're\nnot writing code, we're selling code.\n\n108\n00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.845\nI've got no problem with that,\njust the facts.\n\n109\n00:06:50.845 --> 00:06:52.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now where was I?\n\n110\n00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.110\nYeah, so, capacity planning.\n\n111\n00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.880\nSo, another thing you wanna make sure\nis that your latency within the farm\n\n112\n00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.510\nideally is less than one millisecond or\nyou're gonna run into problems and so\n\n113\n00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.696\nyou should have gigabit ethernet or\nbetter in your environment.\n\n114\n00:07:08.696 --> 00:07:11.960\nIn terms of .net framework requirements,\nand\n\n115\n00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.090\nby the way there's\na prerequisite installer.\n\n116\n00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.400\nSo later in the week, we're gonna get\nsome hands on, my favorite part and\n\n117\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.380\nprobably yours too, we'll see.\n\n118\n00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.940\n>> Yeah.\n>> We'll see by the ratings.\n\n119\n00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.340\n>> Yeah.\n>> This is rated isn't it.\n\n120\n00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.830\n>> each episode actually [CROSSTALK]\n>> Excellent, no pressure.\n\n121\n00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.740\n>> No not at all.\n\n122\n00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.171\n>> All right so yeah review us on Yelp\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n123\n00:07:31.171 --> 00:07:32.940\n>> Well, maybe not Yelp, but\n\n124\n00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.740\nthe point is, these minimums,\nyou don't necessarily have to remember,\n\n125\n00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.770\nbecause if you forget you'll be\nprompted or it will be a deal breaker.\n\n126\n00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.680\nHopefully we don't have too many\nof those this week, but we'll see,\n\n127\n00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.530\nwe'll react appropriately.\n\n128\n00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.761\nBut if your pre-requisites aren't\ninstalled, you can't deploy SharePoint,\n\n129\n00:07:47.761 --> 00:07:48.710\nyou can't install it.\n\n130\n00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:53.923\nBut there's again, from the splash screen\nyou can install pre-requisites, and\n\n131\n00:07:53.923 --> 00:08:00.196\nwe'll need, if you're running Server 2012\nR2, then you need .NET Framework 4.5.2.\n\n132\n00:08:00.196 --> 00:08:05.170\nIf you're brave and running some version\nof Windows 16, maybe a technical preview,\n\n133\n00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.090\nrelease candidate,\nthen you need .NET Framework version 4.6.\n\n134\n00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:15.395\nSo for the purposes of our demonstrations\nthis week we're gonna use server 2012 R 2.\n\n135\n00:08:15.395 --> 00:08:20.054\nWe don't want to introduce too much\ncomplexity, and there's enough.\n\n136\n00:08:20.054 --> 00:08:24.182\nAlthough it's a familiar interface,\n2016, if you're used to 2013,\n\n137\n00:08:24.182 --> 00:08:28.506\nSharePoint, why introduce needless\ncomplexity by introducing Server 2016?\n\n138\n00:08:28.506 --> 00:08:32.321\nWe're not gonna do that, so\nServer 2012 R2, is been established,\n\n139\n00:08:32.321 --> 00:08:35.040\nsolid platform,\nthat's the one we're gonna use.\n\n140\n00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:43.977\nYour database requirements, you need at\nleast SQL Server 2014, or SQL Server 2016.\n\n141\n00:08:43.977 --> 00:08:48.885\nSo for those of you upgrading, perhaps\nyou're running on an older SQL database,\n\n142\n00:08:48.885 --> 00:08:53.670\nyou're gonna need to upgrade your database\nbefore attempting to upgrade SQL.\n\n143\n00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:58.550\nAnd for those of you new to product,\nmake sure you have SQL databases that\n\n144\n00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:02.230\nare running at least SQL Server 2014.\n\n145\n00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:06.270\nOkay, there\n\n146\n00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.890\nare various deployment scenarios in\nterms of upgrading or migrating.\n\n147\n00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:16.580\nThere is a database attach method,\nand this is a native upgrade.\n\n148\n00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.090\nAnd the idea here, and you might have done\nthis method before when upgrading to 2013,\n\n149\n00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.035\nfor example.\n\n150\n00:09:22.035 --> 00:09:27.090\nSo you detach your databases from\nyour old SharePoint deployment and\n\n151\n00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.570\nattach them to your new\nSharePoint deployment.\n\n152\n00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.790\nSo in other words you'll have,\n\n153\n00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:37.240\nlet's say your SharePoint 2013 hardware\nand your SharePoint 2016 hardware,\n\n154\n00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.730\nand your SQL, you detach from the old and\nattach to the new.\n\n155\n00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:46.350\nSo your content databases get physically\nattached to your new deployment.\n\n156\n00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.270\nNow, remember you can\nonly upgrade directly\n\n157\n00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.210\nfrom the previous version of SharePoint.\n\n158\n00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.940\nSo if you have a SharePoint 2010\ndeployment you must first upgrade through\n\n159\n00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.880\none of the various methods\nwe'll look at in this episode.\n\n160\n00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.550\nSame idea, you need to upgrade from 2010\nto 2013, and then from 2013 to 2016.\n\n161\n00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.820\nNow, whenever you're doing sort\nof a two-hop upgrade process,\n\n162\n00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.400\nthat introduces its own complexity, why?\n\n163\n00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.937\nBecause people tend to be so excited with\n\n164\n00:10:16.937 --> 00:10:21.500\na new technology that they don't do\nthe proper checks after upgrading.\n\n165\n00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.220\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n166\n00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.972\n>> So in the example I just gave,\nSharePoint 2010 to 2013,\n\n167\n00:10:25.972 --> 00:10:30.765\nyou must check for functionality, are your\nsites operating the way you expected?\n\n168\n00:10:30.765 --> 00:10:34.780\nAny customizations, preferably you've\nturned them off or disabled them or\n\n169\n00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:35.590\nuninstalled.\n\n170\n00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.300\nBut you need to check to make sure\n\n171\n00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.870\nthe sites are operating\nthe way you expect them to.\n\n172\n00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:45.530\nThey're not gonna be auto-magically\nfixed just by upgrading them again.\n\n173\n00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.830\n>> I often wonder why people\nthink that's gonna happen.\n\n174\n00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.795\nYou don't just upgrade it and\nthe problem will go away.\n\n175\n00:10:49.795 --> 00:10:51.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think you're just\n\n176\n00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.638\nupgrading the problem, you're\nbringing the baggage with you, right?\n\n177\n00:10:53.638 --> 00:10:55.132\n>> That's right.\n\n178\n00:10:55.132 --> 00:10:58.355\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Exactly right, so we need to clean\n\n179\n00:10:58.355 --> 00:11:03.316\nup any debris or lingering issues from\nour intermediate upgrade, if you like,\n\n180\n00:11:03.316 --> 00:11:07.110\nfrom 2010 to 2013,\nbefore upgrading to 2016.\n\n181\n00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:11.820\nNow if you have an existing 2013\nenvironment, then you've been using it for\n\n182\n00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.050\na while, presumably you've\nalready ironed out those bugs so\n\n183\n00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:15.710\nyou're ahead of the game.\n\n184\n00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.340\nAnd then, again,\nif you're installing SharePoint 2016, for\n\n185\n00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:22.880\nthe first time there's no\nbaggage to worry about.\n\n186\n00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.150\nSo you're a step ahead\nof the game that way.\n\n187\n00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:32.490\nOkay, and you need a compatibility\nlevel of 15 or higher.\n\n188\n00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:39.687\nSo your database compatibility level\nis 15.O.4481.1005, memorize that.\n\n189\n00:11:39.687 --> 00:11:42.335\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was kidding.\n\n190\n00:11:42.335 --> 00:11:43.670\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n191\n00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.479\n>> [INAUDIBLE] like madly taking notes,\nwait, what was that again.\n\n192\n00:11:46.479 --> 00:11:49.610\n>> [LAUGH] So, that's right,\nthis will not be repeated.\n\n193\n00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:55.570\nSo one of the features if you like\nin SharePoint 2013 was that we\n\n194\n00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:00.890\ncould view our websites\nin SharePoint 2010 mode.\n\n195\n00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:07.050\nSo we could delay the upgrade of\nthe sites to 2013 indefinitely.\n\n196\n00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:12.370\nWe don't have that option in 2016, so\nthere's no kind of previous version mode.\n\n197\n00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.750\nNo, so as soon as we attach\nour content databases,\n\n198\n00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.748\nif we do the database attach method.\n\n199\n00:12:16.748 --> 00:12:17.687\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n200\n00:12:17.687 --> 00:12:23.590\n>> Then the site contents\nare upgraded to 2016,\n\n201\n00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:29.180\neither via PowerShell script or\nwhen someone visits the site for the first\n\n202\n00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.678\ntime on content that has been recently\nattached in a SharePoint 2016 environment.\n\n203\n00:12:33.678 --> 00:12:38.810\nSo there's no opportunity to view\nsort of an older version of the site.\n\n204\n00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:41.500\nNo, it's only 2016, so\nthat's different from 2013,\n\n205\n00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.430\nwhen you could keep sites in 2010 mode.\n\n206\n00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:50.790\nOkay, so typically we can upgrade\ndatabase by database, in other words,\n\n207\n00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.010\ncontent database by content database.\n\n208\n00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.850\nIf you're feeling bold you\nmight want to migrate or\n\n209\n00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.560\nattach more than one at the same time.\n\n210\n00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.180\nThere are PowerShell\ncommandlets we can use.\n\n211\n00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.710\nNow, I would tell people,\nif you've somehow made it this far,\n\n212\n00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.980\nmaybe you're new to the industry and\nyou're not familiar with PowerShell,\n\n213\n00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.360\nthink of it like PSL,\nPowerShell as a second language.\n\n214\n00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.320\nNow, if you're not a scripter, and\nI'm certainly not a scripter or a dev, but\n\n215\n00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.220\neven I find it user friendly.\n\n216\n00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.760\n>> Yeah.\n>> And easy to use,\n\n217\n00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.950\nwell at least not totally obtuse.\n\n218\n00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:28.600\nIn other words, there's lots of\nbuilt-in help, it uses almost English.\n\n219\n00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.990\n>> Mm hm.\n>> With the commandlets,\n\n220\n00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:34.500\nand there's plenty of online resources\nas well as built-in help as I mentioned.\n\n221\n00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.490\nSo the reason why PowerShell is so\nimportant to learn is,\n\n222\n00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:43.070\nwell first of all, it can greatly speed\nup and automate repetitive tasks.\n\n223\n00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.110\nAnd there's also remoting capabilities,\nso it's very powerful that way.\n\n224\n00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.820\nAnother reason to learn it, or\nput it on your list of things to learn or\n\n225\n00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:57.020\ndabble with, is that there\nare certain power cell functions,\n\n226\n00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.320\nthat are not available in the GUI.\n\n227\n00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.470\nIn other words, there's no GUI equivalent.\n\n228\n00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:04.280\nSo, some people think real computing\nprofessionals use the command line,\n\n229\n00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.620\nor shells, and GUIs are for wimps.\n\n230\n00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.940\nI don't subscribe to that philosophy, but\nthe point is, you're gonna have to learn\n\n231\n00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.900\nsome PowerShell, if only to do some of\nthose tasks that there's no GUI for.\n\n232\n00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:14.901\nNow, typically, sure.\n\n233\n00:14:14.901 --> 00:14:18.490\n>> Yeah, no, it's a big change I've seen\nin Microsoft over the last few years.\n\n234\n00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.440\nAnd we've talked about it in several of\nour server admin classes where you've\n\n235\n00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.610\ngotta learn PowerShell if you're gonna\nmanage Microsoft systems at this point.\n\n236\n00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.310\nBecause, like you say,\nExchange was the same for awhile.\n\n237\n00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.910\nI think the previous version\nof Exchange comes out and\n\n238\n00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.560\nthere's things that you\ncan't do in the GUI,\n\n239\n00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.670\nyou can only do it from PowerShell,\nPowerShell helps me automate it.\n\n240\n00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.945\nAnd, heck, most of the commands we're\nactually issuing in the GUI are generating\n\n241\n00:14:39.945 --> 00:14:41.500\nPowerShell commands in the background.\n\n242\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.830\nSo, you really need to start\nplaying with it and get used to it.\n\n243\n00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:48.084\n>> Exactly,\nnow some of those PowerShell options for\n\n244\n00:14:48.084 --> 00:14:51.879\nwhich there's no GUI equivalent,\nyou might only do once.\n\n245\n00:14:51.879 --> 00:14:54.979\nYeah, for in Exchange is a good\nexample of that, or in SharePoint, so\n\n246\n00:14:54.979 --> 00:14:58.150\nfar and low are configurations\nthat you would only do once.\n\n247\n00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.020\nSo there's no need to try and\n\n248\n00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:04.810\nmemorize some of these commandlets with\nassociated parameters and switches.\n\n249\n00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:08.580\nBecause there's examples online,\nand you can tweak for\n\n250\n00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.370\nyour own benefit in your environment.\n\n251\n00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:12.560\nAnd additionally now,\n\n252\n00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.220\nmost people are running some kind of\nvirtualization on some of the servers.\n\n253\n00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.823\nSo there's really no excuse\nto not learn PowerShell.\n\n254\n00:15:19.823 --> 00:15:23.490\nIn other words you can practice and roll\nback if you somehow screw something up.\n\n255\n00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:28.120\nOr easily create a test environment\nwith virtual machines so\n\n256\n00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.260\nyou can get some confidence and\nexperience.\n\n257\n00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.990\nAnd we'll be demoing\na lot during the week.\n\n258\n00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.743\nOkay, now, very important,\nwhen it comes time,\n\n259\n00:15:37.743 --> 00:15:41.520\nlet's say you've got your 2013 farm,\ncontent database.\n\n260\n00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.364\nYou wanna move over to\nyour SharePoint 2016 farm.\n\n261\n00:15:43.364 --> 00:15:48.601\nYou do not want to have a situation\nwhere you've got your old databases\n\n262\n00:15:48.601 --> 00:15:53.153\nin a read-write scenario, and\nyour new ones read-write.\n\n263\n00:15:53.153 --> 00:15:57.862\nBecause there's gonna be confusion, so\nAnd when it's time to do that migration,\n\n264\n00:15:57.862 --> 00:16:00.150\nyou're moving the content databases,\n\n265\n00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.290\nyou must make your old\ncontent databases read-only.\n\n266\n00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.130\nThen people are still\nable to view the content,\n\n267\n00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:11.960\nthey're just not able to modify or\ndelete or creating new content there.\n\n268\n00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:16.550\nSo this is the kinda thing where\nit's not gonna happen overnight.\n\n269\n00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:21.040\nYou might move content databases over\na period of weeks, maybe on weekends or\n\n270\n00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.280\na period of low activity.\n\n271\n00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.100\nDo one at a time, test it out.\n\n272\n00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.450\nIdeally you're gonna use content\ndatabases with user populations.\n\n273\n00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.340\nBut that aren't gonna freak\nout if something goes wrong.\n\n274\n00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:36.880\nNow typically IT we become our own guinea\npigs, now we can still freak out but\n\n275\n00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.940\ntypically not as much as maybe the CEO or\nsome of the end users.\n\n276\n00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.930\nSo I guess that's a form of dog food,\nyou know what I say.\n\n277\n00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:47.210\nMove your own content databases,\ntry them out, see what's working,\n\n278\n00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.160\nanything needs to be fixed and then you'll\nbe better and form the next time need to\n\n279\n00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.510\nhave a content database and see you should\nget a faster at it, with less hiccups, and\n\n280\n00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:58.370\nmore predictable resolutions for\nany glitches that you may encounter.\n\n281\n00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.330\nOkay so\nafter we move the content databases,\n\n282\n00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:06.760\nwe need to move our site collections.\n\n283\n00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:12.510\nAnd there's ways we can\ndo this manually or\n\n284\n00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:17.850\nwhen a user visits the site collection\nin the new SharePoint 2016 environment,\n\n285\n00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:20.800\nthose sites and site collections\nget updated automatically.\n\n286\n00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.170\nThat's first browse, in other words.\n\n287\n00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:29.660\nYou could allow users to\nmanually port their content over.\n\n288\n00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.470\nThat is a bad idea.\n\n289\n00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:36.510\nAnytime, I just strongly recommend\nagainst that, although it is possible.\n\n290\n00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:40.510\nBecause you're gonna be on the phone\nsupporting them or fixing issues.\n\n291\n00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:41.820\nYou do it, you're IT.\n\n292\n00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.610\nLet the users worry about\ncreating content, or\n\n293\n00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.510\nwhatever they're using\nthe SharePoint interface for.\n\n294\n00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:51.790\nDon't make them quasi admins,\neven if they're so-called power users.\n\n295\n00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:55.850\nEven site collection owners, I wouldn't\nput the onus on them to make that move.\n\n296\n00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.190\nYou move for them.\n\n297\n00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.130\nSome other issues you'll have to resolve,\nincluding if\n\n298\n00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.810\nyou're changing authentication method,\nwhen you're migrating say between\n\n299\n00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.860\nforms based authentication,\nclaims based authentication.\n\n300\n00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:12.250\nIdeally you're not gonna, when you're\ndoing a migration you're not gonna create,\n\n301\n00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.180\nthat's a rather large project in itself.\n\n302\n00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.910\nSo keep the migration process or\nupgrade process as clean as possible\n\n303\n00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.290\nby not trying to do so\nmuch at the very same time.\n\n304\n00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:26.180\n>> We can do that, the authentication\nmigration after we've successfully\n\n305\n00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.410\nmigrated as SharePoint 2016.\n\n306\n00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.330\n>> That's exactly right,\n\n307\n00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:33.440\nthat's a good idea to keep those\ncompletely separate projects.\n\n308\n00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.170\nOkay, so if you're running\nan express version of SQL,\n\n309\n00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.400\nthat's no longer compatible\nwith SharePoint 2016.\n\n310\n00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:44.890\nYou'll need a full flavored\nversion of SQL 2014 SP1 or later.\n\n311\n00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:48.220\nSo SQL 2016 is okay.\n\n312\n00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.610\nIn terms of estimating your time for\n\n313\n00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:57.560\nmigration you should have some idea of\nhow big your site content databases are.\n\n314\n00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:00.410\nThat will help inform the time to move.\n\n315\n00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.450\nAnd, again, the more you do it,\nyou'll get better at estimating\n\n316\n00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:06.350\nthe amount of time remaining to\nmigrate all the remaining content.\n\n317\n00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:13.180\nYour hardware, you might again,\nyou want to verify after migrations.\n\n318\n00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.370\nSo, are the sites working\nthe way you expect them to?\n\n319\n00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.360\nFix whatever issues that exist\nbefore migrating more content.\n\n320\n00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.110\nAnd again, it's an iterative process.\n\n321\n00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.794\nYou get better as you go along.\n\n322\n00:19:30.739 --> 00:19:33.670\nAnother way to go is a scripted migration.\n\n323\n00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:37.570\nThe problem there is it might take\nyou a long time to hone the script\n\n324\n00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:38.250\nto get it right.\n\n325\n00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:45.020\nSo, a third party solution is\ndefinitely a good way to go, why?\n\n326\n00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.850\nBecause that third party developer\nhas had a lot of experience and\n\n327\n00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:53.580\nexperienced a lot of failure and\nlearned from glitches, or\n\n328\n00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.070\nshow stoppers,\nthat could prevent a successful migration.\n\n329\n00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:00.920\nSo, investing in a third\nparty tool is a good\n\n330\n00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.690\nuse of money to make that\n\n331\n00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.980\nmigration process much more seemless\nthan it otherwise would have been.\n\n332\n00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.090\n>> Very good.\nAll right Mark again, just a ton of\n\n333\n00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:17.410\ngreat information on planning out in\nthis case our physical architecture.\n\n334\n00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:21.200\nIf we go back to the previous episodes,\nour logical architecture as well and\n\n335\n00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.750\njust SharePoint in general.\n\n336\n00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:27.340\nSo a lot of important decisions to be\nmade before we ever touch the disk and\n\n337\n00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.890\nstart installing SharePoint if\nwe wanna be truly successful and\n\n338\n00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:32.140\nhave a good successful deployment.\n\n339\n00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.710\nSo we thank you for that Mark.\n\n340\n00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:36.920\nEverybody out there we hope you enjoyed\nwatching as much as we've enjoyed\n\n341\n00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.170\nshooting it for you.\n\n342\n00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.870\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n343\n00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:41.512\n>> And I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n344\n00:20:41.512 --> 00:20:44.020\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n345\n00:20:44.020 -->

--> 00:00:20.200\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.590\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.450\nwe're gonna look at getting\nSharePoint installed, right?\n\n6\n00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.860\nWe spent a lot of time\nin that planning phase.\n\n7\n00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.937\nA very important part of a successful\ndeployment is making sure we know what it\n\n8\n00:00:30.937 --> 00:00:33.145\nis we wanna accomplish with SharePoint.\n\n9\n00:00:33.145 --> 00:00:34.668\nSo we're installing what we need,\n\n10\n00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:37.320\nnot setting up what we don't need\nbecause it is a big product.\n\n11\n00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.960\nIt can do a lot of different things.\n\n12\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.909\nSo the planning phase was very important.\n\n13\n00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:44.900\nBut now we're ready to actually get it\ninstalled and start implementing our plan.\n\n14\n00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.260\nAnd here to help us with that of course,\nis Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n15\n00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.674\nHow's it going Mark?,\n>> Thanks, Mike, great.\n\n16\n00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:51.745\nOkay, at long last,\nthe moment we've all been waiting for.\n\n17\n00:00:51.745 --> 00:00:52.436\n>> Yeah.\n\n18\n00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:53.833\n>> Hands on the product.\n\n19\n00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:55.227\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's neat.\n\n20\n00:00:55.227 --> 00:01:00.270\nSo SharePoint is a three\ngig DVD installation media.\n\n21\n00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.900\nSo I've got that queued up here.\n\n22\n00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.740\nAnd you'll see it in a box, very shortly.\n\n23\n00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.750\n>> All right, we'll put that up.\n\n24\n00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.220\n>> All right, so I'm in my DVD\ndrive there, and let's roll setup.\n\n25\n00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.433\nI wanna run as administrator.\n\n26\n00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:23.896\nAnd there's, well,\nactually a lot of waiting around.\n\n27\n00:01:23.896 --> 00:01:26.100\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.230\n>> We won't have as much today as you'll\n\n29\n00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.220\nprobably encounter out there in the wild.\n\n30\n00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.970\n>> Yeah, this is one thing we've tried\nto do is trim out some of the waiting\n\n31\n00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.740\nprocess here for you guys.\n\n32\n00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.360\nBut it's definitely not\nsomething you're gonna get done\n\n33\n00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.910\nin an hour in the morning, right?\n\n34\n00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:40.566\n>> True.\n\n35\n00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:44.307\nAs Gainesville's own Tom Petty said,\nthe waiting is the hardest part.\n\n36\n00:01:44.307 --> 00:01:45.054\n>> That's right.\n\n37\n00:01:45.054 --> 00:01:47.110\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so, here's a situation where,\n\n38\n00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.460\nif you're starting a clean Server 2012\nR2 installation, you need to make sure,\n\n39\n00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.820\nthere's actually several reboots\nworth of Windows updates to install.\n\n40\n00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.300\nAnd if you forget to reboot\nafter the last batch of updates,\n\n41\n00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.680\nin this case for .NET Framework 4.6,\n\n42\n00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.680\nthen you'll be prompted that you\ncannot continue and you must restart.\n\n43\n00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.480\nI've now restarted.\n\n44\n00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.290\nAnd the Product Key, there's 180 day\ntime bomb Product Key you can use for\n\n45\n00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.970\nboth Enterprise and Standard Editions,\ndifferent keys for each.\n\n46\n00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.720\nI'll enter the Enterprise Key.\n\n47\n00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.089\n>> So that way if you wanted to play\naround with this in a test environment,\n\n48\n00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:29.403\nyou don't have to go buy it right away.\n\n49\n00:02:29.403 --> 00:02:29.932\nYou can just try it out first.\n\n50\n00:02:29.932 --> 00:02:33.442\n>> Yeah, nobody should be forced to\nplunk down $25,000 for a test drive.\n\n51\n00:02:33.442 --> 00:02:35.799\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Your mileage may vary.\n\n52\n00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.283\nYour expense may vary,\ndepending on your small business,\n\n53\n00:02:40.283 --> 00:02:43.480\nwoman owned, governmental NGO, etc.\n\n54\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.110\nSo I tend to steer clear of actual\ncosts and licensing because there's so\n\n55\n00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.180\nmany deals I've encountered\nover the years.\n\n56\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.830\nSo File location,\n\n57\n00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.800\nnow it's always better to store\nSharePoint content off the C drive.\n\n58\n00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.320\nI mean you can move information off\nthe C drive, whether it's data files,\n\n59\n00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.240\nlog files, search and\nindex files, that's better.\n\n60\n00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.900\nBut in our test environment,\nwe're actually doing it all in one which\n\n61\n00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.068\nis one of the modes you\ncan install SharePoint in,\n\n62\n00:03:12.068 --> 00:03:17.750\nas we'll see those options after\nthis progress bar completes.\n\n63\n00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.340\nSo you can have a multiserver deployment,\ntwo server, single server.\n\n64\n00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.867\nSingle server deployment would only make\nsense in some kind of test environment.\n\n65\n00:03:25.867 --> 00:03:27.902\nIt's not certainly not recommended for\na production environment.\n\n66\n00:03:27.902 --> 00:03:30.782\n>> And that's because performance\nis just not gonna be adequate.\n\n67\n00:03:30.782 --> 00:03:31.518\n>> Exactly.\n\n68\n00:03:31.518 --> 00:03:32.210\n>> You try to do it on the same machine?\n\n69\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.736\n>> Exactly.\n\n70\n00:03:32.736 --> 00:03:33.305\n>> Okay.\n\n71\n00:03:33.305 --> 00:03:35.081\n>> It's just asking one\nmachine to do too much.\n\n72\n00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:37.538\nSo when that finishes that section,\n\n73\n00:03:37.538 --> 00:03:43.100\nthen you can either run the configuration\nwizard now, which we'll do, or later.\n\n74\n00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.140\nNow you might say what's the point\nof installing the binaries and\n\n75\n00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.450\nthen not actually configuring?\n\n76\n00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.830\nWell, maybe in a large organization,\n\n77\n00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.052\nyou don't have the privileges to run\nthe config wizard or vice versa.\n\n78\n00:03:54.052 --> 00:03:56.510\nMaybe someone has to install it, and\nyou run the configuration wizard.\n\n79\n00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.530\nOr maybe you don't have time that day,\nso you can split up those tasks and\n\n80\n00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.620\naccess the SharePoint's Product\nConfiguration Wizard as you can see now\n\n81\n00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.660\nfrom the Start Menu,\nif you have to resume installation or\n\n82\n00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.160\nconfiguration at a later date.\n\n83\n00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.430\nAs usual, we have to stop and\nrestart services, IIS,\n\n84\n00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.658\nSharePoint Admitting Service.\n\n85\n00:04:17.658 --> 00:04:20.997\nThe SharePoint Timer Service\nis a vital component and\n\n86\n00:04:20.997 --> 00:04:24.867\nis involved in all kind of\nprocesses relating to SharePoint.\n\n87\n00:04:24.867 --> 00:04:29.701\nSome processes happen at every x number\nof minutes, others are hourly, daily,\n\n88\n00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:31.274\nweekly, monthly, etc.\n\n89\n00:04:31.274 --> 00:04:35.100\nThey're all get initiated by a timer job.\n\n90\n00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.710\nSo I'm either gonna join an existing\nfarm or create a brand new one.\n\n91\n00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.930\nI've selected create a brand new\none which means I am creating a new\n\n92\n00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.490\nconfiguration database.\n\n93\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.440\nIn a real sense,\nthe configuration database is the farm.\n\n94\n00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.490\nSo when you add additional servers to the\nfarm, you wanna make sure that you specify\n\n95\n00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.280\njoining an existing SharePoint deployment,\nnot creating a new one.\n\n96\n00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.530\nNow, you need a valid domain account.\n\n97\n00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.420\nSo I showed you the dialogue box, if you\ndon't use a valid domain account, and\n\n98\n00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.810\nthen using the correct one,\nso it's domainname\\username.\n\n99\n00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.600\nAnd then a passphrase better than a\npassword, because a phrase can be a word.\n\n100\n00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.076\nMaybe it's a slogan for some company.\n\n101\n00:05:18.076 --> 00:05:19.321\nI'm loving it.\n\n102\n00:05:19.321 --> 00:05:21.330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For example, or\n\n103\n00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.070\nsomething that's easy for you to remember.\n\n104\n00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.450\nAnd you can have spaces in a passphrase.\n\n105\n00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.050\nAnd I got another error there.\n\n106\n00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.865\nOops, I'm supposed to have some complexity\nrequirements, special characters,\n\n107\n00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:32.825\nnumbers, etc.\n\n108\n00:05:32.825 --> 00:05:35.844\nSo it's not as easy to guess.\n\n109\n00:05:35.844 --> 00:05:40.746\nAnd you can change that passphrase later\nif you want, but if you're joining\n\n110\n00:05:40.746 --> 00:05:45.810\nnew servers to your deployment later on,\nyou must specify the passphrase.\n\n111\n00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.630\nHere's where I can choose,\n\n112\n00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:54.450\nam I selecting a server to\njoin an existing deployment?\n\n113\n00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.911\nOr creating a brand new, in this case,\nI'll choose single server farm.\n\n114\n00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:02.873\nSo again, not designed for production,\ngood for dev or testing, and\n\n115\n00:06:02.873 --> 00:06:06.035\nwhen you want to just\nexplore the interface.\n\n116\n00:06:06.035 --> 00:06:11.100\nI'm showing that you can select other\n\n117\n00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.850\nserver options, and then you get\na helpful description of the server role,\n\n118\n00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.350\nin case you're not familiar with the\nvarious roles in a SharePoint environment.\n\n119\n00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.956\n>> Now if we do a single server farm,\nare we stuck with that?\n\n120\n00:06:21.956 --> 00:06:24.027\nOr we can change that later on,\nif we choose to?\n\n121\n00:06:24.027 --> 00:06:29.898\n>> Yeah, we can't add to that later,\nactually.\n\n122\n00:06:29.898 --> 00:06:30.722\nWe are stuck with that.\n\n123\n00:06:30.722 --> 00:06:31.631\n>> Got you.\n\n124\n00:06:31.631 --> 00:06:32.440\n>> Later in the week,\n\n125\n00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.640\nwe'll look at a different environment\nwhere we do have multiple servers.\n\n126\n00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.595\n>> Okay, yeah.\n\n127\n00:06:36.595 --> 00:06:40.746\n>> And now for the central admin site or\nthe web app rather,\n\n128\n00:06:40.746 --> 00:06:43.573\na bit of security through obscurity,\n\n129\n00:06:43.573 --> 00:06:49.598\nwe specify a five digit port number\nup to 64K, so 1 to 65,000 in change.\n\n130\n00:06:49.598 --> 00:06:51.543\nI just choose 55,555.\n\n131\n00:06:51.543 --> 00:06:55.370\nVery few people should\nhave access to this site.\n\n132\n00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.720\nMost people won't even\nknow about its existence.\n\n133\n00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.712\nThe reason is if you have access to that,\nthose farm little settings,\n\n134\n00:07:02.712 --> 00:07:04.412\nyou can do whatever you want.\n\n135\n00:07:04.412 --> 00:07:07.095\nYou can grant yourself\npermissions to access or\n\n136\n00:07:07.095 --> 00:07:10.390\ndo anything you want in\nan entire SharePoint deployment.\n\n137\n00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:14.327\nSo very should people should have\nthose farm admin permissions.\n\n138\n00:07:14.327 --> 00:07:19.310\nAll right, now this can take a while,\nsome steps rush by so\n\n139\n00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.445\nfast, you might miss them,\nothers take their sweet time.\n\n140\n00:07:24.445 --> 00:07:26.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can see the various steps involved.\n\n141\n00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.729\nTen tasks which hasn't changed\nfrom previous versions-\n\n142\n00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:30.905\n>> All right.\n\n143\n00:07:30.905 --> 00:07:32.170\n>> In the process of configuring.\n\n144\n00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.408\nSo we'll let this run.\n\n145\n00:07:35.408 --> 00:07:37.770\n>> And\nwe got one of those famous progress bars.\n\n146\n00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.026\nIt really doesn't tell you\nhow far along you are,\n\n147\n00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:41.970\nit just kind of scrolls across the screen.\n\n148\n00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.882\n>> And\nit could be hypnotic if you stare at it.\n\n149\n00:07:43.882 --> 00:07:44.730\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n150\n00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.360\n>> Do look away, periodically.\n\n151\n00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.318\n>> We were talking about that\nthe other day, you and I, about,\n\n152\n00:07:49.318 --> 00:07:53.553\nyou had mentioned the stat about how users\nspend 10 to 40% of their time looking for\n\n153\n00:07:53.553 --> 00:07:57.440\nthe stuff they need to do their job And we\nwere joking about how IT people probably\n\n154\n00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.470\nspend ten to 40% of their time\nstaring at progress bars.\n\n155\n00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.580\n>> That's right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n156\n00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.170\n>> That's right.\n\n157\n00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.840\nSurely there's something else we can do.\n\n158\n00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.380\n>> Right?\n>> But\n\n159\n00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.830\nno because often it requires babysitting\nand you might go away for lunch and\n\n160\n00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:12.090\nthen realize the progress bar ended,\nthe task completed and\n\n161\n00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.750\nit's waiting for some okay or\nsome one click to keep going.\n\n162\n00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.280\n>> Yes.\n>> Which is so frustrating.\n\n163\n00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.160\n>> It can be annoying.\n\n164\n00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:20.400\nFor sure.\n\n165\n00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.508\nAll right so now we're on step ten,\nfinalizing the SharePoint configuration.\n\n166\n00:08:29.895 --> 00:08:33.430\nAlmost, wait for it.\n\n167\n00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.775\nSo exciting I can't stand it.\n\n168\n00:08:36.775 --> 00:08:41.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n169\n00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.430\nSo I get this installed and then.\n\n170\n00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.710\n>> Obviously we got a lot\nmore configuration to do.\n\n171\n00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.570\nThis is just basically\ngetting it installed.\n\n172\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.370\n>> Absolutely.\n\n173\n00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.260\nOkay, success.\n\n174\n00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.430\nWas there any doubt?\n\n175\n00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.080\nNo.\n>> No.\n\n176\n00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.110\n>> So you might want to screenshot this or\ngood to write down or\n\n177\n00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:03.050\nsomehow record you have the various\naccounts they'll be using in a SharePoint\n\n178\n00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.560\ndeployment, as opposed to\ntrying to remember them all.\n\n179\n00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.200\nKeep in mind that you may not be\nthe only person configuring your farm,\n\n180\n00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.140\nif you're a farm admin.\n\n181\n00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.620\nSo you should jot down those settings, and\n\n182\n00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.900\nthen when I finish that wizard,\nlet's see what happens next.\n\n183\n00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.620\nYou can see there,\nif you look in the address bar.\n\n184\n00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.390\nWe've got the server name,\n\n185\n00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:27.530\nwhich is SVR01 in this case,\nwith a colon and the port number.\n\n186\n00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.170\nThat's the five digit port number it\nchose for the central admin website.\n\n187\n00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.740\nSo that's the way to navigate\nthere in the future.\n\n188\n00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:39.440\nThere's also a shortcut available\nfrom start if you forget your\n\n189\n00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.150\nfive digit port number in the future.\n\n190\n00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.860\nNow, one of the general things about\nSharePoint which wasn't always true, but\n\n191\n00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.080\nis extremely useful.\n\n192\n00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:58.130\nThe idea of security trimmed menu options,\nalso security trimmed search results.\n\n193\n00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.090\nSo, with security trimmed menu options,\n\n194\n00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.820\nthat means, let's say I don't have\npermissions to perform a certain action.\n\n195\n00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.640\nI won't see that option\non a drop down menu.\n\n196\n00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.880\n>> Nice.\n>> That's handy.\n\n197\n00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.080\nThe worst thing is, well maybe not the\nworst thing, but we don't want a situation\n\n198\n00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.300\nwhere somebody sees an action option,\nbut it's grayed out and\n\n199\n00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.650\nthey click it and nothing happens and\nthey're probably going to call.\n\n200\n00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.440\nThey have no idea what they're trying\nto do and they'll call and say, but\n\n201\n00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:23.980\nhey, I can't do this.\n\n202\n00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:24.740\nI'm the owner.\n\n203\n00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.250\nI should be able to figure\nout this doohickey.\n\n204\n00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.500\nSo, security trend menu items means that\n\n205\n00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.550\nif I don't have permissions to perform\nthat action, it won't show up in the menu.\n\n206\n00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.269\nSo, in other words, you and\nI might have different permissions.\n\n207\n00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.560\nAnd so we can click on\nthe same drop down menu and\n\n208\n00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.210\nsee a different total number or options.\n\n209\n00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.350\n>> Nice.\n>> Because I'm a farming man\n\n210\n00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:46.860\nand you're not.\n\n211\n00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.600\n>> Definitely gonna save some calls\nto the help desk there, though.\n\n212\n00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.560\n>> Absolutely.\n\n213\n00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.650\nAdditionally security\nterms search results,\n\n214\n00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.760\njust pointing this out now\nbecause in case I forget later,\n\n215\n00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:02.940\nlet's say you search for an item,\nyou use a search phrase.\n\n216\n00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.140\nAnd then it comes back\nwith a bunch of results.\n\n217\n00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.450\nThen you click on one that you don't\nhave access to, but you see the title.\n\n218\n00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.720\nThe title of the document might be enough\nto cause wide spread panic, like, layoffs.\n\n219\n00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're clicking frantically.\n\n220\n00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.790\nSo, again, if you don't have\npermissions to the search results,\n\n221\n00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.540\nthey don't appear in your search results.\n\n222\n00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.500\n>> Very nice.\n\n223\n00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.540\n>> Alright.\nSo now, moved on here.\n\n224\n00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.670\nAnd then we're at the initial\nconfiguration screen, and\n\n225\n00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:37.950\nI can either choose the manual option,\nto configure everything myself.\n\n226\n00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.760\nI'd have to cancel or\nstart the wizard button.\n\n227\n00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.420\nUp on the top there is a gear\nicon with some various options.\n\n228\n00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.300\nFor now I'm gonna kick off the wizard and\n\n229\n00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:53.160\nI can use an existing managed\naccount which happens to\n\n230\n00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:58.250\nbe my currently logged in user name or\nI could create a new managed account.\n\n231\n00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.200\nLet's see what happens if I try and\n\n232\n00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.580\ncreate a new managed account\nright now from the interface.\n\n233\n00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.189\n>> All right.\n\n234\n00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.030\n>> Place your bets.\n\n235\n00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.235\nWill this work or not?\n\n236\n00:12:06.235 --> 00:12:08.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Will I be able to create a new\n\n237\n00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.500\nmanaged account, called managed account,\nright from this interface?\n\n238\n00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.290\nWe'll find out.\n\n239\n00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.260\nBut first,\nlet's look at the service applications.\n\n240\n00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.870\nIn other words,\nfunctionality that we can introduce and\n\n241\n00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.420\nmake available in our\nSharePoint environment.\n\n242\n00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:29.530\nThings like, access services, the BDC or\nbusiness data connectivity service,\n\n243\n00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.360\nthat acronym has changed\nover the various versions.\n\n244\n00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.710\nThat means it's a way to connect\nto any organized data source.\n\n245\n00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.200\nSo you might have a line to\nbusiness database app for example.\n\n246\n00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.810\nYou might have to create the middleware or\nconnector.\n\n247\n00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:45.490\nThat's what the BDC refers to,\na way of translating and\n\n248\n00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.700\nconnecting our SharePoint environment\nwith that organized data source.\n\n249\n00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:54.550\nManaged metadata service there, we talked\nabout taxonomies and hierarchies, and\n\n250\n00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.610\nterm sets in another episode.\n\n251\n00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.380\nSome of you will be using\nSharePoint with Project Server, so\n\n252\n00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:07.060\nthere's a service app to fully\nintegrate with Project Server.\n\n253\n00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.610\nSecure storage service there.\n\n254\n00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:13.240\nUseful for,\nlet's say we're selling a product online.\n\n255\n00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.130\nWe've got to save credentials\nduring the session.\n\n256\n00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.410\nAnd what else do we have here.\n\n257\n00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:19.310\nOther options.\n\n258\n00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.020\nWorkflow service applications.\n\n259\n00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.710\nSo again, any kind of, we talked in\nanother episode, anything you can dream up\n\n260\n00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:30.310\nthat can happen electronically we can do\nin the context of a SharePoint workflow.\n\n261\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:38.930\nAnd we have SQL server reporting services,\ndiagnostics there, document conversions.\n\n262\n00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:43.010\nSo, to make content\nrenderable in a browser,\n\n263\n00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:47.070\nwe use the document conversion service SQL\nserver reporting services I mentioned.\n\n264\n00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.230\n>> This is really where we're deciding\nwhat components of SharePoint we\n\n265\n00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.880\nwanna install.\n\n266\n00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.910\nSo from the results of our planning phase,\nwe would know what we wanted to check or\n\n267\n00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:56.750\nuncheck here.\n\n268\n00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.520\n>> Right.\nAnd this totally flexible architecture.\n\n269\n00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.590\nYou're not stuck with whatever settings\nyou might utilize some functionality and\n\n270\n00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.950\nchange your mind about it later or\nstart small and\n\n271\n00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.020\nthen add in more functionality as you go.\n\n272\n00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.240\nNow, the moment of truth.\n\n273\n00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.338\nI'll click on the next button.\n\n274\n00:14:10.338 --> 00:14:15.880\nAnd, what happened?\n\n275\n00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.080\nOkay, so the account called\nmanaged account was not found, so\n\n276\n00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.900\nI fact I cannot create a managed account\nright from within that interface.\n\n277\n00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.800\nBut I can just go over to AD users and\ncomputers from my server manager, and\n\n278\n00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.880\ncreate an account,\nour managed account, that way.\n\n279\n00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.200\nWhich I'll show you now.\n\n280\n00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:38.700\n>> And this is a managed account like\nwe've learned in our MCSA classes.\n\n281\n00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.590\nWhere Windows is going to take\ncare of changing the password for\n\n282\n00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.070\nus every so often.\n\n283\n00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.530\n>> Yes, that's a beautiful thing.\n\n284\n00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:51.470\nSo there's often a conflict between\nsecurity and convenience or hassle.\n\n285\n00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.330\nSo let's say you have a policy\nin your organization that\n\n286\n00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.550\nrequires password changes every six weeks.\n\n287\n00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.480\nWell, if you have 50 service accounts or\n\n288\n00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.510\n20 service accounts, that's a lot\nof account passwords to change.\n\n289\n00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.700\n>> It's almost a full time job just\nkeeping track of when I'm supposed to\n\n290\n00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.240\nchange them and what one's I gotta change.\n\n291\n00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.240\n>> Exactly.\n\n292\n00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.980\nSo why not, instead,\nhave Windows take care\n\n293\n00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.870\nof the password changes automagically,\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n294\n00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:15.840\nIt happens for you.\n\n295\n00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.810\nThe only potential drawback is that\nyou don't know what the password is.\n\n296\n00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:21.520\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n297\n00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.790\n>> Now, if you need to reset\n\n298\n00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:23.770\nthe password, you can.\n\n299\n00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:27.140\nBut as long as Windows is managing\nthe password account changes.\n\n300\n00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.510\nThen you don't know what the password\nis for the service account.\n\n301\n00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.940\nBut that shouldn't be a big deal.\n\n302\n00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.850\nIf it is,\nthen don't use managed accounts, right?\n\n303\n00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:35.900\nOkay, so that works.\n\n304\n00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:36.970\nOkay, so.\n\n305\n00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.097\nNow, I have the option to\ncreate a site collection.\n\n306\n00:15:40.097 --> 00:15:42.786\nWe'll talk about some of\nthe functionality, and\n\n307\n00:15:42.786 --> 00:15:46.947\nsome of the options with creating site\ncollections now, and more later, but\n\n308\n00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:50.420\nsince it popped up after that install,\nit's a good time as any.\n\n309\n00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:54.366\nSo let's, I'll give it a title,\nso each site collection.\n\n310\n00:15:54.366 --> 00:15:58.450\nIf you recall in another episode,\nwe talked about\n\n311\n00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:03.950\napplication pools as being like\ncarving out a section of RAM.\n\n312\n00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:10.240\nWithin application pools,\nwe can create, have applications and\n\n313\n00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.870\nthen we can create site collections\nwithin them in our SharePoint context.\n\n314\n00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:19.150\nSo, we talked about\nextending SharePoint sites,\n\n315\n00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:25.620\nor sorry, extending IS sites to allow for\nSharePoint functionality.\n\n316\n00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.260\nHaving done that,\nthen we can now create site collections.\n\n317\n00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.880\nSo, let's just call this one Demo.\n\n318\n00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.740\nAnd now the website address, so,\n\n319\n00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:39.610\nyou see here that we've got a few options,\nand this is the actual path.\n\n320\n00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:45.002\nSo, we've got http:// the server name,\nwhich is SVRO1,\n\n321\n00:16:45.002 --> 00:16:51.614\nand then I can choose the coveted top of\nthe hierarchy right after that slash or\n\n322\n00:16:51.614 --> 00:16:56.498\nI can create this new site\ncollection under slash sites,\n\n323\n00:16:56.498 --> 00:16:59.890\nor even under slash my personal.\n\n324\n00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:03.810\nThis brings in the concept of managed\npath, we'll talk about later, but\n\n325\n00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:08.440\nit's a way of managing aspects,\n\n326\n00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:13.330\nor sections if you like,\nof the whole URL namespace.\n\n327\n00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:18.960\nSo because shorter URLs are considered\nmore glamorous, people tend to\n\n328\n00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.340\nwant to have the root site collection of\nthe root site, so they have a shorter URL.\n\n329\n00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:28.580\nSometimes this gets, leads to turf\nwars where people don't want to be,\n\n330\n00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.810\nsort of underneath another division for\nexample.\n\n331\n00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:36.520\nAnd everyone wants their own top level\nsite in their own site collection, so.\n\n332\n00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:41.220\nBut again, as we looked at in another\nepisode, you're not, it's highly unlikely\n\n333\n00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.950\nyou're gonna bump up against\nsoftware limitations in SharePoint.\n\n334\n00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:49.014\nIN other words, it'll be your hardware\nthat provides the restriction or\n\n335\n00:17:49.014 --> 00:17:50.930\ncramps your growth.\n\n336\n00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.030\nYou'll have to expand hardware.\n\n337\n00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.484\nThe software you can\ncreate millions of sites.\n\n338\n00:17:55.484 --> 00:17:57.306\nVery few organizations are gonna\nneed millions of sites.\n\n339\n00:17:57.306 --> 00:17:57.969\n>> Right.\n\n340\n00:17:57.969 --> 00:18:03.067\n>> Okay, so for now, I'll just\nleave it at the root level there,\n\n341\n00:18:03.067 --> 00:18:07.511\nso my URL path will be\nright under http://sbr01.\n\n342\n00:18:07.511 --> 00:18:08.672\nI really should get a mouse for\nthis thing.\n\n343\n00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:09.624\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n344\n00:18:09.624 --> 00:18:12.479\n>> It hasn't really been a problem before.\n\n345\n00:18:12.479 --> 00:18:16.159\nWhoa, okay, so then template options.\n\n346\n00:18:16.159 --> 00:18:18.787\nThe charm bar, the bane of my existence.\n\n347\n00:18:18.787 --> 00:18:20.970\n>> Tell you what, I don't know.\n\n348\n00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:25.900\n>> Okay, so we do have a variety\nof templates to choose from.\n\n349\n00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:31.070\nRemember from a different episode, you can\ncustomize any of the default templates or\n\n350\n00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.890\nstart from scratch and\ncreate your own template.\n\n351\n00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:39.110\nIt's a good idea to save any, let's say\nyou use an existing template as the basis\n\n352\n00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:43.240\nand you customize for your own purposes,\nmaybe you add some more web parts for\n\n353\n00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.450\nexample or you change the look and\nfeel somehow.\n\n354\n00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:48.410\nSave that template with a different name.\n\n355\n00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:53.320\nNot a default name and in a different path\nthan the default directory for templates.\n\n356\n00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.000\nOkay, so, team site is the default.\n\n357\n00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.798\nI could choose to create a project site,\na community site.\n\n358\n00:18:59.798 --> 00:19:04.352\nJust gonna go over to.\n\n359\n00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:05.850\nOkay, I don't have those options.\n\n360\n00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.650\nSo let's go team site and\n\n361\n00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:12.560\nthere's an optional description there\nwhich you could throw something in\n\n362\n00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.390\nto help people when they're choosing\nwhich site they want to participate in.\n\n363\n00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.653\nI'll click OK.\n\n364\n00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:25.350\nAnd wait for\nthis site collection to be created.\n\n365\n00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:29.760\nYou can see the little jade or\nthe little circle in the tab up there.\n\n366\n00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:33.262\nMicrosoft has come up with\nvarious ways to hypnotize us.\n\n367\n00:19:33.262 --> 00:19:36.342\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> With the little dots that go around or\n\n368\n00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:37.490\nprogress bars.\n\n369\n00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:44.088\n>> So, right now it's basically building\nour site collection in that configuration\n\n370\n00:19:44.088 --> 00:19:49.150\ndatabase, and\npreparing an actual site on IAS.\n\n371\n00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:53.094\n>> Right, which brings up an interesting\npoint, Mike, and that is,\n\n372\n00:19:53.094 --> 00:19:58.320\nalthough a lot of changes that we\nmake from our central admin site, for\n\n373\n00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:03.910\nexample impact IAS in some way, you\ndefinitely do not want to go into IAS and\n\n374\n00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:08.600\nmake settings changes there, unless that's\nthe only way to make a settings change.\n\n375\n00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:13.330\nFor example, some certificates you\nmight want to create or deploy.\n\n376\n00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:17.970\nAnything that you can administer from\nthe SharePoint central admin site,\n\n377\n00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.930\nthat's where you should administer it.\n\n378\n00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:24.826\nEven though, as we go through there\ncreating web apps, web applications which\n\n379\n00:20:24.826 --> 00:20:29.428\nlive in application pools,\nyou might say, well, these are settings\n\n380\n00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:34.055\nchanges that pertain to IS settings,\nI'll just make those changes in IS.\n\n381\n00:20:34.055 --> 00:20:38.932\nNo, bad idea, because the SharePoint\nsettings will overwrite, in some cases,\n\n382\n00:20:38.932 --> 00:20:41.276\nchanges that you make directly on IAS.\n\n383\n00:20:41.276 --> 00:20:46.530\nSo always use central admin site,\neither the GUI, or PowerShell.\n\n384\n00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:50.970\nSo we'll look at some PowerShell\noptions for routine tasks, and\n\n385\n00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:54.860\nas Mike had mentioned on another episode,\na lot of what we do in the GUI nowadays,\n\n386\n00:20:54.860 --> 00:21:01.600\nwhether it's Server 2012, 2016, or other\nproducts like Exchange or SharePoint,\n\n387\n00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.528\nunder the hood, the actions that we set\nup are being executed via PowerShell.\n\n388\n00:21:06.528 --> 00:21:11.175\nSo it behooves us to learn PowerShell,\nand as I always evangelize that if you\n\n389\n00:21:11.175 --> 00:21:15.896\ndon't know anything about PowerShell now,\nor you somehow fear scripting or\n\n390\n00:21:15.896 --> 00:21:19.525\nthink I don't know how to dev,\nI'm not a script guy or gal,\n\n391\n00:21:19.525 --> 00:21:24.460\nthey make it as easy as possible to learn\nand get up to speed with built-in help and\n\n392\n00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:28.716\nlots of online resources and\ncourses for that matter on PowerShell.\n\n393\n00:21:28.716 --> 00:21:32.855\nOkay so, we now got to the screen\nthat says this completes the form\n\n394\n00:21:32.855 --> 00:21:37.238\nconfiguration wizard, hallelujah,\nand let's scroll down here.\n\n395\n00:21:37.238 --> 00:21:42.682\nSo it shows details of the farm there.\n\n396\n00:21:42.682 --> 00:21:45.340\nI can scroll this way maybe, there we go.\n\n397\n00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.292\nWhat a concept, I have a touchscreen.\n\n398\n00:21:46.292 --> 00:21:47.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which I forget sometimes.\n\n399\n00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.420\nI'm switching between a touchscreen and\n\n400\n00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.480\nanother computer that\ndoesn't have a touchscreen.\n\n401\n00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.040\nSo sometimes I'm touching the screen,\nwait a minute, yeah, wrong computer.\n\n402\n00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.000\n>> It's not working.\n[LAUGH]\n\n403\n00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.610\n>> My bad.\n\n404\n00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:57.640\nMaybe I should just standardize on one.\n\n405\n00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.110\nIt's nice to have two though.\n\n406\n00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.588\nOkay, so we can see various\nservice applications there.\n\n407\n00:22:01.588 --> 00:22:06.090\nHybrid features, so\n\n408\n00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:12.120\nalluding to Office 365 and\nSharePoint Online functionality.\n\n409\n00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:16.230\nSo you might have some aspects of\nyour deployment on premises, and\n\n410\n00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:20.180\nothers in the cloud, and\nthat's totally normal nowadays.\n\n411\n00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.140\nAnd a reminder that you can,\n\n412\n00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:26.160\nthere's a Configuration Wizards\nlink in the Quick Launch Bar.\n\n413\n00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.680\nThe Quick Launch Bar is that area\nof the screen on the left-hand side\n\n414\n00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.180\nwith shortcuts to various\ntasks you may perform.\n\n415\n00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.486\nYou also see the Quick Launch Bar\non regular old sites.\n\n416\n00:22:38.486 --> 00:22:43.810\nNow it's definitely a best\nprocess to not overload visitors\n\n417\n00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:49.190\nto your sites with dozens of links because\nthen a quick launch becomes a slow launch.\n\n418\n00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:50.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You don't want to just have you\n\n419\n00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:54.970\nscrolling up multiple screens trying\nto find the shortcut they want.\n\n420\n00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:59.170\nSo that means, as I mentioned before,\nsometimes somebody has to say no.\n\n421\n00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.760\nThe more popular your\nSharePoint roll out becomes,\n\n422\n00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.500\nmaybe you roll it out\ndepartmentally at first,\n\n423\n00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.370\nthen other people get wind of it and\nthey want their own departmental\n\n424\n00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:12.019\nportal perhaps or site collections for\ntheir team or project based sites.\n\n425\n00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.174\nSharePoint can become a victim of its\nown success if you have, let's say,\n\n426\n00:23:17.174 --> 00:23:20.430\na regional Intranet page, or\ncompany-wide Intranet page, and\n\n427\n00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:24.276\nall of a sudden everyone wants their own\nshortcuts to their regional picnic or\n\n428\n00:23:24.276 --> 00:23:27.080\nnews items, and\nthen the page can get totally clogged.\n\n429\n00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:27.927\nThat's not helpful.\n\n430\n00:23:27.927 --> 00:23:32.188\nSo somebody has to have the authority and\nwillingness to say, no,\n\n431\n00:23:32.188 --> 00:23:34.940\nthis link does not belong on the homepage.\n\n432\n00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.440\nWe could put it in\na departmental page that\n\n433\n00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.600\nother people can link to if they want.\n\n434\n00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:44.064\nSo there's various topology designs for\nsite collections and\n\n435\n00:23:44.064 --> 00:23:48.946\nalways the customer,\ninternal customer, i.e., employees, or\n\n436\n00:23:48.946 --> 00:23:53.255\nexternal customers or partners,\nalways have them in mind.\n\n437\n00:23:53.255 --> 00:23:58.067\nSo that might make more hassle for you\ndesigning your SharePoint environment But\n\n438\n00:23:58.067 --> 00:24:03.365\nit'll make it easier for the people that\nwe're designing it for, the end users.\n\n439\n00:24:03.365 --> 00:24:06.240\nOkay, that's my first of,\nor the next spiel.\n\n440\n00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.170\nI'll have many more mini rants.\n\n441\n00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.710\nHere's our site URL that's listed there.\n\n442\n00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:15.510\nAgain you might want to do\na screenshot of this page,\n\n443\n00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:19.840\nbut all this information is still readily\navailable if you forget any of it.\n\n444\n00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.490\nOkay, so, as it says,\nthat completes the wizard.\n\n445\n00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.130\nI'll click on the finish button, and I'm\nnot gonna configure hybrid features now,\n\n446\n00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.790\nwe'll come to that in a later episode.\n\n447\n00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:36.060\nAnd the little wheel is spinning\naround again in the tab.\n\n448\n00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.550\nAll right, now this is,\nit's a bit of crying wolf.\n\n449\n00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:45.260\nEvery time I've ever installed\na SharePoint in the last decade, there's\n\n450\n00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.600\nalways this yellow bar saying Health\nAnalyzer detected some critical issues.\n\n451\n00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.340\nI think Microsoft puts it there just\n\n452\n00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:55.020\nto make you aware that\nthe Health Analyzer exists.\n\n453\n00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:59.350\nI don't think these issues\nrequire a gold bar kind of alert.\n\n454\n00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:00.940\nAt least it's not red.\n\n455\n00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:04.990\nSo there's a link there to\nview those issues if you want,\n\n456\n00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:07.560\nbut that's something you can put off.\n\n457\n00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.090\nLet's see now, what else do we have?\n\n458\n00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.828\nOkay, so we have various categories.\n\n459\n00:25:11.828 --> 00:25:16.193\nSo if you look again on the quick\nlaunch section on the left-hand side,\n\n460\n00:25:16.193 --> 00:25:21.219\nunder Central Administration you can see\nOptions like Application Management,\n\n461\n00:25:21.219 --> 00:25:22.408\nSystem Settings.\n\n462\n00:25:22.408 --> 00:25:26.601\nAnd then if you look over to the body\nof the main part of the screen,\n\n463\n00:25:26.601 --> 00:25:31.790\nyou can also see those general section\nheaders, like Application Management,\n\n464\n00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:35.170\nSystem Settings,\nGeneral Application Settings.\n\n465\n00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:40.790\nSo like many things, Microsoft has several\nways to accomplish the exact same thing.\n\n466\n00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:44.470\nYou can click on the left-hand side,\nsay application management, or\n\n467\n00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:47.450\nyou can click application management\nin the main part of the screen.\n\n468\n00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:53.740\nAnd then the most popular\nlinks related to that section,\n\n469\n00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:57.200\nfor example under application management,\nwe have manage web applications.\n\n470\n00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.580\nThe most popular applications\nappear right there.\n\n471\n00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.080\nIf I were to click on application\nmanagement either of the two application\n\n472\n00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.830\nmanagement links then I'd have\na far greater list of options.\n\n473\n00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:12.270\nBut often you're doing one thing like\nmanaging or creating a web application.\n\n474\n00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:13.920\nCreating a site collection.\n\n475\n00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.690\nSo Microsoft through extensive research\nhas figured out which of the most\n\n476\n00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:23.800\npopular reasons or links that people\nclick after clicking on a section header.\n\n477\n00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.410\nFor example under security,\nmanage the farm administration group.\n\n478\n00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:30.808\nSo it just saves you one click,\nthat's all.\n\n479\n00:26:30.808 --> 00:26:34.960\nBut again so whatever appears\nunderneath these general sections,\n\n480\n00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.920\nlike general application settings.\n\n481\n00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:41.570\nThis is not an exhaustive list, this is\nonly a small part of the total options\n\n482\n00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:46.528\nyou'd get by clicking on those settings.\n\n483\n00:26:46.528 --> 00:26:49.000\nOkay, so there's a lot to show you\n\n484\n00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:54.730\nrelated to the farm development before\nwe get into nitty gritty detail.\n\n485\n00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:57.128\nSo we're talking about\ngeneral farm wide settings.\n\n486\n00:26:57.128 --> 00:27:01.828\nAgain, very few people will ever see\nthis screen because just like enterprise\n\n487\n00:27:01.828 --> 00:27:04.188\nadministrators in your environment.\n\n488\n00:27:04.188 --> 00:27:07.786\nWe don't want everyone and their dog\nhaving access to maybe make a settings\n\n489\n00:27:07.786 --> 00:27:10.560\nchange that would pooch your environment.\n\n490\n00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.470\nThat's a technical term.\n\n491\n00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:17.650\nSo, that said, let's delve in.\n\n492\n00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:19.929\nSo I'm going to click on system settings.\n\n493\n00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:28.420\nAnd if you've noticed, they say\neverything in SharePoint is a web page.\n\n494\n00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.285\nThat's not entirely true,\nbut almost everything is.\n\n495\n00:27:31.285 --> 00:27:31.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n496\n00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:35.930\nremember there's no Microsoft management\nconsole which I'm sure you're more\n\n497\n00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:40.260\nfamiliar with than\nadministering via web page But\n\n498\n00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.110\nthat's the way it is, so get used to it.\n\n499\n00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.210\nFor third party tools,\n\n500\n00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:48.480\nthere wouldn't be more of an mmc type\nof environment available in some cases.\n\n501\n00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:53.400\nSo that's the world we live in,\nis browser based administration.\n\n502\n00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.890\nCertainly for SharePoint.\n\n503\n00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:58.730\nOkay, so notice that on the left\nhand side on quick launch,\n\n504\n00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:03.020\nwe still have our quick\nlaunch options there.\n\n505\n00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.840\nAnd you know what,\n\n506\n00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:09.420\nthere's so much more to say I'm gonna\npass it over to our great host Mike.\n\n507\n00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.470\n>> Getting ready to have to\ncut you off there, Mark so.\n\n508\n00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:16.610\nA lot of them you know we've got\nSharePoint installed, now it's time to\n\n509\n00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:20.060\ndive in and take a look at some of\nthe options getting it configured, and\n\n510\n00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:23.140\ngetting it ready for you actually\nin our production environment.\n\n511\n00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:27.130\nBut unfortunately we're out of time for\nthis particular episode, so for\n\n512\n00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:30.210\nnow signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n513\n00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:30.788\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n514\n00:28:30.788 --> 00:28:33.288\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n515\n00:28:33.288 -->

at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.010\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.539\nToday we're doing our SharePoint 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.162\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:24.580\nwe're going to be taking a look at\nconfiguring our farm settings, right?\n\n8\n00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.780\nIn a previous episode, we got SharePoint\ninstalled, went through the wizard,\n\n9\n00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.460\ngot everything ready, but we still have\na lot of things to do before we try to\n\n10\n00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.060\nactually use SharePoint, so here to\nhelp us with that is Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n11\n00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.250\nHow's it going Mark?\n\n12\n00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.360\n>> Great Mike thank you.\n\n13\n00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.230\nWe'll be working on the farm all day long.\n\n14\n00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.130\nThis is part two of\nlooking at farm settings.\n\n15\n00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.510\nThere could be a part three.\n\n16\n00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.080\nThere's a lot to cover.\n\n17\n00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.890\nWe're not gonna cover\n\n18\n00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.230\nabsolutely everything you need to\nknow about share point this week.\n\n19\n00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.220\nBut we'll certainly wet your appetite.\n\n20\n00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.360\nAnd cover all the objectives for\nthe first SharePoint 2016 admin exam.\n\n21\n00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.600\nSo let's keep going.\n\n22\n00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.140\n>> All right.\n\n23\n00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.090\n>> So let me get a screen shot please,\nmy demo machine.\n\n24\n00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.020\nRight on.\nAll right, so when we, in a previous\n\n25\n00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.880\nepisode, we got to this point where\nwe're looking at farm settings.\n\n26\n00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.730\nSo let's look at, under the server\nsection, Manage Servers in this farm.\n\n27\n00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.250\nRemember everything is web page,\nso it loads up.\n\n28\n00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.660\nSo, at this point I only have\nthe one server, server 01 or SVR01.\n\n29\n00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.903\nI always think it should be SRV\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n30\n00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:36.380\n>> Stevie Ray Vaughan.\n\n31\n00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.090\n>> In fact, somebody mistyped that,\nbut I digress.\n\n32\n00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.690\nOkay, so we can see a variety of\nservices running on this server.\n\n33\n00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.040\nWe don't wanna have unnecessary services,\nand in SharePoint 2016,\n\n34\n00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.250\nwe've got the min rule option,\nwhich automatically takes care of\n\n35\n00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.610\nRunning services you need on\na particular server and no more.\n\n36\n00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.250\nSo you don't have to remember\nto disable or turn off or\n\n37\n00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.930\ndeactivate certain services\nthat happens automatically.\n\n38\n00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.140\nThat's cool.\n\n39\n00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.740\nNow remove server would not be a good move\nbecause it's the only server in the farm,\n\n40\n00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.000\nbut there's a link to do that.\n\n41\n00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.410\nWhat happens if I click on\nthe link to the server?\n\n42\n00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.830\nNow I have a page where,\nI'm sure if you've been to the admin\n\n43\n00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.750\nconsole for services,\nregular Windows services.\n\n44\n00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.680\nThis is a little different,\nbut similar kind of idea,\n\n45\n00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.250\nI've really got to get a mouse.\n\n46\n00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.385\nIf anyone could bring\na mouse I'd be grateful.\n\n47\n00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:34.240\n[LAUGH] Set it in.\n\n48\n00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.540\nAlright so various services now hopefully\ncolor coded so green for started,\n\n49\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.630\nred for stop and we can choose to\n\n50\n00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.800\nrestart a service, a service here for\ncentral admin for example,\n\n51\n00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.310\na document conversions to render\ndocuments, visible in a browser.\n\n52\n00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.255\nWe've got the timer service.\n\n53\n00:02:58.255 --> 00:03:01.030\n[COUGH] Sometimes resetting\nthe timer service,\n\n54\n00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.600\nby the way,\nis a great way to improve performance.\n\n55\n00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.460\nIt gets somehow bloated over time and\nstarts consuming more and more memory.\n\n56\n00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.860\nSo just resetting or restarting the timer\nservice from this console or even from\n\n57\n00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.460\ntask manager is a good way, in a lot of\nways, screwing up the SharePoint system.\n\n58\n00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.550\nIt will automatically restart itself\nafter a maybe, ten second delay.\n\n59\n00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.180\nSo, if you haven't rebooted your machine,\nor reset the timer services,\n\n60\n00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.390\nrestarted it in a while, and\nyou go to task manager and say, hey, wow,\n\n61\n00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.910\nthis is a consuming 20% of my RAM.\n\n62\n00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.900\nJust kill that process and it'll restart\nusing a much lower amount of RAM.\n\n63\n00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.570\n>> That's a good tip.\n\n64\n00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.990\n>> That's a little tip, yeah.\n\n65\n00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.320\nSo that's server one.\n\n66\n00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.948\nThat's not what I wanted.\n\n67\n00:03:48.948 --> 00:03:50.670\n[LAUGH] No.\n\n68\n00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:58.130\nOkay, So I will click on,\nlets go back in to, central admin.\n\n69\n00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.100\nI'm surprised actually I got that\nscreen that I got hitting the back\n\n70\n00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.070\nbutton on my, or alt, arrow key.\n\n71\n00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.980\nBut anyway,\nback where we were under Servers.\n\n72\n00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.700\nManage Services,\nthat's a shortcut to where we just were so\n\n73\n00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.350\nI can click on Manager Servers and\n\n74\n00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.290\nthen click the server object to\nmanage services or go directly there.\n\n75\n00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.920\nFor the server or in this case the farm,\nlet's check that one out.\n\n76\n00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.463\nSo these are farm level services.\n\n77\n00:04:30.643 --> 00:04:32.430\nSandbox code service.\n\n78\n00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.840\nThat's a way to isolate specific code to,\nso\n\n79\n00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.780\nit doesn't overwhelm\nresources of a server.\n\n80\n00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.930\nIf you're working on a custom app for\nexample for example you can restrict\n\n81\n00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.590\nthe CPU cycles and RAM usage for\nthat app so that it can get work done\n\n82\n00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.840\nwithout negatively impacting everyone else\nthat's using the SharePoint environment.\n\n83\n00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.520\n>> Very convenient.\n\n84\n00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.990\n>> Yeah so if you're using SharePoint,\nas you add more and more functionality to\n\n85\n00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.370\nyour deployment they'll be more contention\nfor resources so this kind of isolation\n\n86\n00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.489\nbecomes more important if you've got any\ncustom code you're running or developing.\n\n87\n00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.000\nOkay, User Profile Service,\n\n88\n00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.470\ncertainly a big part of synchronizing\ndata from Active Directory.\n\n89\n00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.150\nSo for user profiles we have some\ncontent that gets pre populated from\n\n90\n00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.870\nActive Directory, and\nothers that we add manually.\n\n91\n00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.070\nOur users can add information about\nthemselves in a SharePoint context.\n\n92\n00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.230\nAll right.\n\n93\n00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:29.581\nGo back here.\n\n94\n00:05:32.122 --> 00:05:34.540\nConvert server role on this farm.\n\n95\n00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.530\nLet's check that one out.\n\n96\n00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.560\nOkay, so I can,\nthere's not a lot of conversion options.\n\n97\n00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.300\nOkay.\n\n98\n00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.500\nHere we are, we can change to.\n\n99\n00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.260\nSo remember there's more\nflexible architecture in 2016,\n\n100\n00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.160\nespecially compared to\nthe early days of SharePoint.\n\n101\n00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.970\nSo.\n\n102\n00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:55.240\nI can configure this machine now to be an\napplication server which is a middle tier\n\n103\n00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.050\nworkload environment optional but\nthe bigger your deployment gets, the more\n\n104\n00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.860\nlikely you are to have not only separate\ntiers but redundancy at each tier.\n\n105\n00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.180\nSo, two or three web front end servers,\nfor example,\n\n106\n00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.290\nwhich the clients interact with.\n\n107\n00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.720\nOne or\nmore application servers in the middle.\n\n108\n00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.300\nAnd then in the back end,\nwe have our sequel service.\n\n109\n00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.630\nSo we could have a converting\nto a search role.\n\n110\n00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:27.430\nSo that, as you might guess, is optimized\nfor search, which can be a huge\n\n111\n00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.860\nperformance hit on your devices.\n\n112\n00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.000\nSo much so, that organizations often\ndedicate one or more boxes to search, and\n\n113\n00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.040\none or more boxes to indexing.\n\n114\n00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.075\nWhen I say boxes, I always mean\neither physical or virtual machines.\n\n115\n00:06:40.075 --> 00:06:41.710\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So depending on the total content\n\n116\n00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.690\nyou're crawling,\nif you're a 100 year old law firm and\n\n117\n00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.920\nyou're digitizing your content,\nthat's a lot to crawl.\n\n118\n00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.510\nAt least at first.\n\n119\n00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.920\nAnd then there's a lot less new data\ncoming in that needs to be crawled.\n\n120\n00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.970\nSo if it's static data, you don't\nneed to re crawl it but if you wanna\n\n121\n00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.180\nmake it available by search and SharePoint\nit has to be crawled at least once.\n\n122\n00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.760\nAnd then the more volatile the data is\nthe more likely you need to index it\n\n123\n00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.070\nespecially if we're talking about third\nparty content on external sites for\n\n124\n00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.460\nexample depending on how fresh your\ncontent needs to be for users,\n\n125\n00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.460\nthat will determine how often you are\ncrawling the content, then indexing it,\n\n126\n00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.480\nthen making it available to search.\n\n127\n00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.480\nSo that's how you can change the role.\n\n128\n00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.260\n>> That's pretty cool though.\n\n129\n00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.600\nSo if you felt like you're getting\nready to index a bunch of content,\n\n130\n00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:30.010\nI can add a server to my farm change\nthat role, let it do that for awhile.\n\n131\n00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.530\nNow once I don't need an extra\nserver doing that, cuz it's static,\n\n132\n00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.740\nI could then provision it for something\nelse, continue to use that server for\n\n133\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.960\nanother role within SharePoint.\n\n134\n00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.680\n>> Excellent point.\n\n135\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.140\nYes, you have that flexibility to\nadjust your workload as required.\n\n136\n00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.410\nThat's a good point.\n\n137\n00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:50.674\nNow we have the next section, under System\nSettings, is E-mail, and Text Messages.\n\n138\n00:07:50.674 --> 00:07:55.951\nSo, there are a lot of\nsituations where users might\n\n139\n00:07:55.951 --> 00:08:00.624\nwant to be alerted about\na change in content.\n\n140\n00:08:00.624 --> 00:08:06.180\nSo, for example, let's say I'm\nresponsible for taking some kind of\n\n141\n00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:12.190\naction on a document, as soon as it\nhits a certain document library.\n\n142\n00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.120\nThat could be, for\nexample, a new customer.\n\n143\n00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.600\nSomeone has gone to our website,\nand they've requested information.\n\n144\n00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.270\nAnd then a document automatically\nlands inside of a document library,\n\n145\n00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.450\nand then I have, part of my job is\nto take action on that document.\n\n146\n00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.143\nWell, rather than me having to check\nto see if there's any new content\n\n147\n00:08:30.143 --> 00:08:34.010\nin the document library every hour,\nwhy not make it so\n\n148\n00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.320\nI can be alerted as soon as content\nis put into that document library?\n\n149\n00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.504\nOr perhaps if I'm collaborating\nwith someone else on a document,\n\n150\n00:08:42.504 --> 00:08:46.020\nmaybe I wanna be notified when there's\nbeen a change to that document.\n\n151\n00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.470\nSomeone has made a change, saved it,\nI need to know about it and\n\n152\n00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.650\ncan maybe review their work for example.\n\n153\n00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.680\nOr if we're handing off work flow,\nthen it's' my turn to take some action on\n\n154\n00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.450\nthe document get some paperwork done,\ndigitally or otherwise.\n\n155\n00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.570\nSo I could be notified by\na process called Alert.\n\n156\n00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.590\nNow I could theoretically have hundreds\nof alerts, that could be overwhelming.\n\n157\n00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:13.374\nSo I have the option then of being alerted\nimmediately, or in a daily digest,\n\n158\n00:09:13.374 --> 00:09:17.571\nin other words, one email per day\nsummarizing all the changes that I\n\n159\n00:09:17.571 --> 00:09:20.462\nwould've been alerted about individually.\n\n160\n00:09:20.462 --> 00:09:22.320\nAnother option is the weekly digest.\n\n161\n00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:31.310\nSo, of course, it depends on how urgently\nyou need to be notified of the changes.\n\n162\n00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.940\nSo, but anytime, I,\n\n163\n00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.960\npersonally, we talk about being\noverwhelmed with data in our environment,\n\n164\n00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.790\nso anyway I can short cut that process,\nand have information come to me\n\n165\n00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:47.180\nthat's relevant to me, without me having\nto look for it, that makes my life easier.\n\n166\n00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.480\nIt's less I have to remember,\n\n167\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.290\ntrying to think about in my\nbrain to freeze up brain power.\n\n168\n00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.120\nSo that is the purpose for\nthese farm level settings.\n\n169\n00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.220\nSo we have to have an SMTP server setup or\nelse we can't generate alerts.\n\n170\n00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.740\nNow, I just gave you\nthe end user scenario.\n\n171\n00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.150\nIf I'm an admin, I'd have a different\ninterest in the SharePoint environment.\n\n172\n00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:09.660\nI mean, I'm a user as well, but I'm mostly\nconcerned with farm administration.\n\n173\n00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:16.060\nSo I have to set up outgoing email\nsettings to specify an SMTP server.\n\n174\n00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.530\nI won't do that here but I'm just showing\nyou the fields to enter the outbound SMTP\n\n175\n00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:26.130\nserver and then a from address and reply\nto address, so that when a user get's\n\n176\n00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:30.980\nan alert they see who it's from and that's\nbased on the entry in this field here.\n\n177\n00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.840\nAnd then a server port is optional there.\n\n178\n00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:38.325\nSo that is the outgoing email settings,\nand\n\n179\n00:10:38.325 --> 00:10:41.305\nthen I can configure\nincoming email settings.\n\n180\n00:10:41.305 --> 00:10:44.980\nNow you might think why would\nI want an email SharePoint?\n\n181\n00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.140\nThere's a warning there I\nhaven't installed SMTP.\n\n182\n00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:53.460\nWell Part of the frustration some users\n\n183\n00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.970\nhave with SharePoint is maybe they're\nused to saving documents in a file share,\n\n184\n00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.720\nwhich was a one-click operation,\nmaybe two clicks.\n\n185\n00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.223\nNow typically in a SharePoint, we're\nasking them to click more times to get\n\n186\n00:11:03.223 --> 00:11:05.697\nthrough to the information they need or\neven to save.\n\n187\n00:11:05.697 --> 00:11:08.667\nAlthough, let's say they're\nworking at an office document,\n\n188\n00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:10.099\nlike a PowerPoint slide deck.\n\n189\n00:11:10.099 --> 00:11:14.996\nThey go to save that slide deck,\nwe can have these SharePoint document\n\n190\n00:11:14.996 --> 00:11:18.400\nlibraries populate in\nthe save as dialogue box.\n\n191\n00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.200\nSo, they just select that SharePoint URL,\n\n192\n00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.930\nas opposed to having to type in a long\nURL, which they probably won't remember.\n\n193\n00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.099\nSo, that will probably\nbe a nice short cut.\n\n194\n00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.600\nAnother way to put information into\na document library is via email.\n\n195\n00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.990\nOkay, remember we're talking\nabout farm level settings so\n\n196\n00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:40.860\nbefore I can have an individual\ndocument library email enabled.\n\n197\n00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.440\nI have to make sure that it\nisn't able at the farm level.\n\n198\n00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:50.770\nAnd this might not work actually\ncuz I haven't set up SMTP.\n\n199\n00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:52.180\nThere's also a drop folder there.\n\n200\n00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.130\nSo the idea is once I've enabled\nthis at the forum level,\n\n201\n00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.860\nthen an individual site collection\nadministrator can choose whether or\n\n202\n00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.800\nnot to email enable\ntheir document library.\n\n203\n00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.960\nWhat that means is the user can just\nemail, just like they're emailing their\n\n204\n00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.608\ncolleague, Across the world or\nat the next desk, it's that easy.\n\n205\n00:12:07.608 --> 00:12:11.510\nAnd that's the same process to get\na document into a document library.\n\n206\n00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.860\n>> Wow.\n>> They just send an email with\n\n207\n00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.970\nthe attachment, and\nthen the attachment becomes a document, or\n\n208\n00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.630\na SlideDeck, or what have you,\nin the document library.\n\n209\n00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:20.950\nSo that's good.\n\n210\n00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.827\nUsers love that because probably everyone\nhas emailed an attachment before.\n\n211\n00:12:25.827 --> 00:12:27.627\n>> Yes.\n>> That's not new learning.\n\n212\n00:12:27.627 --> 00:12:31.307\nIt's just, it's a different contact\nif you like in a contacts list.\n\n213\n00:12:31.307 --> 00:12:34.510\nIt happens to be a document\nlibrary that they're E-mailing.\n\n214\n00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.440\n>> That's fantastic.\n\n215\n00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.196\n>> Yeah, that's a lot less clicks\nto get that document there.\n\n216\n00:12:38.196 --> 00:12:40.201\nSo these are farm wide settings again, so\n\n217\n00:12:40.201 --> 00:12:42.980\nwe have to enable income\nEmail at the farm level.\n\n218\n00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.800\nAnd then that will surface an option\nin the site collection settings\n\n219\n00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.960\nwhich we'll get into this week.\n\n220\n00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.120\nSo that site collection\nadministrators can choose whether or\n\n221\n00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.510\nnot they want to email\nenable document libraries.\n\n222\n00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.150\nNow, when I mentioned site collection\nadministrator that brings up\n\n223\n00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.170\nanother point.\n\n224\n00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:06.320\nSo SharePoint there's so many tie-ins it's\ntough to I mean we have an outline here\n\n225\n00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:12.130\nof things to cover But\nit's tough to stick to that topic\n\n226\n00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:17.230\nonly because every SharePoint somehow\nrelates to other topics in SharePoint.\n\n227\n00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:21.088\nSo there's gonna be some\nbouncing around plus my brain may\n\n228\n00:13:21.088 --> 00:13:23.223\nnot remember later in the week.\n\n229\n00:13:23.223 --> 00:13:28.639\nSo I'll try and keep it coherent or\nat least entertaining.\n\n230\n00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:29.658\n>> You're doing a great job so far.\n\n231\n00:13:29.658 --> 00:13:32.765\n>> Thank you, thanks Mike,\nhappy to be here, what was my point?\n\n232\n00:13:32.765 --> 00:13:34.400\nYeah, so delegated administration.\n\n233\n00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.190\nSo we have farm administrators we're\nconcerned with farm-wide settings,\n\n234\n00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:43.430\nsetting up servers, assigning roles,\nperhaps allow a delegating permission.\n\n235\n00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:47.670\nSo one of the ways we can delegate\npermission is by having site collection\n\n236\n00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:51.670\nadministrators, so that they are\nresponsible just for their site collection\n\n237\n00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.460\nat all the sites there could be tens of\nthousands of sites in a site collection.\n\n238\n00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.800\nBut they are the all powerful\nwithin their site collection.\n\n239\n00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.530\nSo they can make settings changes.\n\n240\n00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:06.210\nThey can decide on site templates\nthat are allowed to be used.\n\n241\n00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:10.369\nThey can assign permissions to users for\nvarious sites or subsites.\n\n242\n00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.100\nSo we don't want to be in a situation\nin IT where as farm administrators,\n\n243\n00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.310\nwe're thinking big picture.\n\n244\n00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.420\nWe don't also want to be responsible for\ntiny picture.\n\n245\n00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:25.210\nIn other words, we don't want to get\na call from help desk saying, so and so\n\n246\n00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:29.600\nneeds access to this document library\nin the marketing site collection.\n\n247\n00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.320\nThat is something that if again,\nit comes down to training.\n\n248\n00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.560\nThat should be part of a basic training\ncourse, or lunch and learn session, for\n\n249\n00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.220\nsite collection administrators,\nhow to grant permissions, to users.\n\n250\n00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.166\nTo a resource, or an entire site,\nin your site collection.\n\n251\n00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:48.787\nSo we wanna empower and train up,\nsite collection administrators,\n\n252\n00:14:48.787 --> 00:14:53.885\nto avoid the Not to make anyone wrong but\nthe lower level requests that really\n\n253\n00:14:53.885 --> 00:14:58.608\nshould be handled by someone else\nwhile we focus on big picture items.\n\n254\n00:14:58.608 --> 00:15:07.020\nOkay, so we can also create distribution\ngroups in a SharePoint context.\n\n255\n00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.340\nSo, this way we can have SharePoint's,\nemail-enabled SharePoint lists.\n\n256\n00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:19.550\nSo an easy way to email\na lot of people at once, and\n\n257\n00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.190\nthat's all we need to see on\nthe incoming e-mail settings.\n\n258\n00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:26.070\nWe'll click on Cancel there, and\nthen a Mobile Account as well.\n\n259\n00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.187\nSo maybe you wanted to\nget as a farm admin, but\n\n260\n00:15:29.187 --> 00:15:31.658\nyou want to get SMS notifications.\n\n261\n00:15:31.658 --> 00:15:36.349\nThe server blew up or\nthe backup didn't work or\n\n262\n00:15:36.349 --> 00:15:39.355\nsomething of that nature, so\n\n263\n00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:44.527\nyou can get a text message about that,\nif you want or\n\n264\n00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:49.940\ne-mail or if it was a regular\nphone you can be called,\n\n265\n00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.576\nbut not from SharePoint directly.\n\n266\n00:15:53.576 --> 00:15:54.312\nIt's time to plant some seed.\n\n267\n00:15:54.312 --> 00:15:55.288\n>> That's right.\n\n268\n00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:58.954\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay, I'm getting loopy already.\n\n269\n00:15:58.954 --> 00:16:00.530\nLet's go under farm management.\n\n270\n00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.050\nSo, alternate access mappings.\n\n271\n00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.656\nThis brings up the concept of zones.\n\n272\n00:16:05.656 --> 00:16:12.260\nSo, you may recall from another episode,\nwe talked about zones as being a vector.\n\n273\n00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.259\nWith five zone possibilities, Intranet,\n\n274\n00:16:16.259 --> 00:16:21.088\nExtranet, Internet, custom, for example.\n\n275\n00:16:21.088 --> 00:16:25.760\nSo rather than, let's say,\ntypically we have different user\n\n276\n00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.900\npopulations accessing content\nin our SharePoint environment.\n\n277\n00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.200\nSo we've got our internal users.\n\n278\n00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:35.040\nWe might have customers,\nsuppliers, vendors\n\n279\n00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:41.010\nall wanting access to some of\nthe same kinds of information.\n\n280\n00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:45.270\nSo rather than having to duplicate or\ntriplicate, etc., information.\n\n281\n00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:48.490\nWhy not have that information\nexisting one time, but\n\n282\n00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.280\nprovide different ways to\naccess that information?\n\n283\n00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.110\nThat's the concept of zones and\nalternate access mappings.\n\n284\n00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:59.380\nSo in other words, internally I\nmight be able to type in Intranet\n\n285\n00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:04.190\nin my address bar and get to my Intranet\nsite, but that wouldn't make sense.\n\n286\n00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.720\nThat wouldn't resolve properly if I was\ntrying to access my Intranet site from\n\n287\n00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.990\noutside the firewall.\n\n288\n00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:13.690\nSo, there would be a longer URL for\n\n289\n00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:19.510\noutside access or for, let's say,\na customer to access our website.\n\n290\n00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.790\nSo, with an alternate access\nmappings we can grant\n\n291\n00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:26.720\nadditional ways to access\nthe exact same content.\n\n292\n00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.030\nAnd then we can see\nthe public URL there as well.\n\n293\n00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.090\nSo that's all I'll say about that for now.\n\n294\n00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:41.250\nAnd, let go back here, Farm Features okay.\n\n295\n00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:46.180\nSo, in the ShapePoint deployment you\nhave the out-of-the-box deployment\n\n296\n00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.400\nwith certain features or\nfunctionality enabled.\n\n297\n00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:55.509\nThere are different levels at which we can\nenable functionality through features.\n\n298\n00:17:55.509 --> 00:17:59.510\nThe farm level, the SharePoint farm covers\neverything in our Share Point deployment.\n\n299\n00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:03.590\nSo, by enabling, or\nactually the word is activating or\n\n300\n00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:09.920\ndeactivating a feature we are enabling\nfunctionality or removing functionality.\n\n301\n00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.350\nWe can also create custom\nfeatures on our own.\n\n302\n00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:18.254\nThat feature could simply be to expose\n\n303\n00:18:18.254 --> 00:18:22.700\na bar or a button that people can click,\nfor example.\n\n304\n00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.560\nSo the great thing about SharePoint is\nyou got out-of-the-box and it's fine,\n\n305\n00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.330\nbut there's so\nmuch customization potential as well.\n\n306\n00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:33.050\nNot just for branding, look,\nand feel, menu options.\n\n307\n00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:38.880\nIn fact, some of the most popular\nwebsites in the world, you would never\n\n308\n00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.340\nguess they're SharePoint sites because\nof the customizations they've done.\n\n309\n00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.060\nFerrari.\n\n310\n00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.660\nI used to show a bunch of demos of sites.\n\n311\n00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.520\nFerrari was one that you look at it and\nsay, wow, that's a SharePoint site?\n\n312\n00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.060\nNot that there's anything wrong\nwith a SharePoint sites, but for\n\n313\n00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.270\nsome reason people often say,\nokay, we love SharePoint.\n\n314\n00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.590\nDesign a site but just make sure it\ndoesn't look like a SharePoint site.\n\n315\n00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:58.090\nGo figure.\n\n316\n00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.220\nOkay.\n>> That used to be the thing,\n\n317\n00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.030\ncuz you could say,\nthat's a SharePoint site.\n\n318\n00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:02.880\nYou know you look at it,\n\n319\n00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.850\ncuz they left that default template or\njust used the defaults.\n\n320\n00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.200\n>> Exactly.\n\n321\n00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.300\nOkay, so certain features\nexist at the farm level only.\n\n322\n00:19:12.535 --> 00:19:15.820\nOthers exist at the web application level.\n\n323\n00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:22.006\nSo web application, within a web app\nwe have one or more site collections.\n\n324\n00:19:22.006 --> 00:19:25.143\nThey're also features\navailable to activate or\n\n325\n00:19:25.143 --> 00:19:29.750\ndeactivate at the site collection\nlevel and also at the site level.\n\n326\n00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:34.840\nThat's four different places where\nfunctionality can be exposed or hidden.\n\n327\n00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:41.400\nSometimes you have to enable\na feature at one level and\n\n328\n00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.660\nanother level,\nspecifically publishing, for example.\n\n329\n00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.170\nSo, if you want to take advantage of\npublishing functionality in SharePoint,\n\n330\n00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.470\nlet's say you're running msn.com,\n\n331\n00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.940\nyou're probably going to have\na multi-farm environment.\n\n332\n00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.360\nYou know, dev, test, production, and\n\n333\n00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:01.190\nyou need to port content\nbetween those different farms.\n\n334\n00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.920\nShoot, I lost my train of thought, ha!\n\n335\n00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.680\nYeah, right, so\nto enable the publishing feature\n\n336\n00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.765\nyou'd have to enable at\nthe site collection level.\n\n337\n00:20:09.765 --> 00:20:11.300\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n338\n00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.780\nAnd then at the site level.\n\n339\n00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:14.280\n>> Nice.\n\n340\n00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.940\n>> Unless you enable\nfeatures in that order\n\n341\n00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.878\nthen you won't have\npublishing available to you.\n\n342\n00:20:19.878 --> 00:20:22.540\nSo, the farm-wide features, typically,\n\n343\n00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:26.390\nyou'd only see it at the farm level, web\napp features, cycle action site features.\n\n344\n00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.960\nSo, let's look at some\nof these farm features,\n\n345\n00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.340\nnow that we know there's four different\nplaces to activate or deactivate them.\n\n346\n00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.730\nAnd we know that certain\nfeatures are active because\n\n347\n00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.158\nunder the status call on the right\nhand side, it says Active.\n\n348\n00:20:41.158 --> 00:20:45.360\n[LAUGH] All right, so this is kinda cool,\n\n349\n00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.000\na cloud video thumbnail provider,\nthat's new.\n\n350\n00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.720\nSo a way to generate thumbnails for\nvideos,\n\n351\n00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.320\na thumbnail is that single frame you see.\n\n352\n00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.902\nOops.\n\n353\n00:20:57.902 --> 00:21:05.040\nTo give some idea to what the video is\nabout that users may want to click on.\n\n354\n00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.980\nThat's a thumbnail.\n\n355\n00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.600\nExcel services there.\n\n356\n00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.420\nThis is annoying, I can't seem to scroll\ndown without getting the charm bar.\n\n357\n00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.290\nOkay, let's see,\n\n358\n00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:22.630\nOffice Web Parts, I went by there\ntoo quickly, let's go back up there.\n\n359\n00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:28.800\nGlobal Web Parts, so a web part is\nanother way to introduce functionality.\n\n360\n00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:34.369\nAnd a web part,\nwe could use to expose baseball scores,\n\n361\n00:21:34.369 --> 00:21:40.666\nsome KPI information or\nstock ticker, weather information.\n\n362\n00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:45.749\nAnything you can dream up electronically\nwhether it's a video feed, a piece\n\n363\n00:21:45.749 --> 00:21:51.140\nof data from somewhere internally or\nexternally, you can expose via a web part.\n\n364\n00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.450\nIn fact templates, so\n\n365\n00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:57.540\nwe created a template earlier when\nwe created our site collection.\n\n366\n00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.786\nThat might have been a different episode,\nactually.\n\n367\n00:21:58.786 --> 00:21:59.665\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the point is,\n\n368\n00:21:59.665 --> 00:22:01.920\nthere are many templates to choose from.\n\n369\n00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.460\nA template is a combination of web parts.\n\n370\n00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.210\nAgain, totally customizable.\n\n371\n00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.420\nOkay, scroll down here.\n\n372\n00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:18.960\nServer to server authentication,\nspell checking, so\n\n373\n00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.570\nthat is a feature.\n\n374\n00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:25.580\nVisio process repository, so\n\n375\n00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:30.410\nto enable that document library feature if\nyou're working with video, for example.\n\n376\n00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:34.459\nSo those are some of\nthe farm level features.\n\n377\n00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.950\nSo if we decide to activate one of these,\n\n378\n00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:43.410\nthat makes it available to all the web\napps and site collections in the farm.\n\n379\n00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.930\nBut then we could to a specific\nsite collection, say,\n\n380\n00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:48.412\nwe don't want that at\nthis one site collection?\n\n381\n00:22:48.412 --> 00:22:53.480\n>> Yes, now, we don't have time\nto cover an exhaustive list,\n\n382\n00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.170\nbut some farm features\nyou'd never see the options\n\n383\n00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:01.001\nrelated to that at a different level\nlike web apps, site collection, or site.\n\n384\n00:23:01.001 --> 00:23:04.560\nOthers, all right, let's say I activate\na feature at the farm level that would\n\n385\n00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:10.410\nexpose or make available other features\nfurther down the chain, if you like.\n\n386\n00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:14.130\nSo again, these are not cast in stone.\n\n387\n00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.550\nLet's see what happens if\nI click on Active here,\n\n388\n00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.560\nnext to farm level exchange tasks sync.\n\n389\n00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:25.546\nSo I'll click on Activate, uh-oh [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n390\n00:23:25.546 --> 00:23:30.380\nCould be because we don't\nhave SMTV set up, I suppose.\n\n391\n00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:34.720\n>> No, this is clearly, Microsoft says,\nsorry, we made some changes and\n\n392\n00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.625\nthis functionality is no longer supported.\n\n393\n00:23:36.625 --> 00:23:39.640\n[LAUGH] Thanks for\nleaving it in the interface.\n\n394\n00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.180\n>> Yes, [LAUGH].\n\n395\n00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.115\n>> Nothing but net,\nno net ladies and gentlemen.\n\n396\n00:23:43.115 --> 00:23:45.974\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No net, no nothing but net, no net.\n\n397\n00:23:45.974 --> 00:23:53.733\nOkay, so lets look at a feature\nthat will actually work.\n\n398\n00:23:53.733 --> 00:23:56.832\n[SOUND] Site mail box\nprobably won't work either.\n\n399\n00:23:56.832 --> 00:24:00.050\nLet's see what happens when we deactivate.\n\n400\n00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:02.590\nFor example, the Visio process repository.\n\n401\n00:24:04.058 --> 00:24:08.540\nOkay now helpfully we get a warning so in\ncase I accidentally click the deactivate\n\n402\n00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.510\nbutton, I can really think through.\n\n403\n00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:14.620\nOkay is that what I wanted to do and\nthere's also a warning that\n\n404\n00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.360\nthere might be other dependencies\nin terms of features or apps.\n\n405\n00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.360\nSo there can be some\n\n406\n00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.680\nadditional consequences to deactivating\nthis feature at the farm level.\n\n407\n00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:29.050\nSo in this case I might look and say,\nwell I'm not sure what depends on this.\n\n408\n00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:32.580\nI'm gonna hold off for now, maybe do some\nresearch before actually deactivating.\n\n409\n00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.385\nBut in this environment what\ncould possibly go wrong?\n\n410\n00:24:35.385 --> 00:24:38.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nothing.\n\n411\n00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.361\nThrough miracle of checkpoints.\n\n412\n00:24:43.361 --> 00:24:43.902\n>> That's right.\n\n413\n00:24:43.902 --> 00:24:46.792\n>> So now, sometimes it happens,\nit takes a minute or\n\n414\n00:24:46.792 --> 00:24:49.023\nso, that happened almost right away.\n\n415\n00:24:49.023 --> 00:24:53.141\nSo now we know that that was successful\nbecause next to Visio process repository\n\n416\n00:24:53.141 --> 00:24:56.645\nit says, well there's no active\nbutton in the right hand column and\n\n417\n00:24:56.645 --> 00:25:00.590\nthere's the option to activate in\nthe column that's second from the left.\n\n418\n00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:06.230\nSo I'll just restore it to where it\nwas before and click on activate and\n\n419\n00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:10.720\nthen that happened immediately so\nwe see Visio process repository.\n\n420\n00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.882\nThat feature is active farm wide.\n\n421\n00:25:15.482 --> 00:25:16.422\nGood times.\n\n422\n00:25:16.422 --> 00:25:17.502\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n423\n00:25:17.502 --> 00:25:19.980\n>> What else to do we have here?\n\n424\n00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:24.710\nFarm solutions, so features we can enable\nor sorry, use the right terminology,\n\n425\n00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.710\nwe can activate or deactivate.\n\n426\n00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:28.510\nAgain at four different levels.\n\n427\n00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:33.010\nThere's also another way to introduce\nfunctionality and that is via a solutions.\n\n428\n00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:37.740\nThis can be some custom code we developed\nto maybe capture some information or\n\n429\n00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.780\nprovide some functionality farm wide.\n\n430\n00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.970\nAnd we can introduce this via a solution.\n\n431\n00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:49.230\nSo now there's an additional step\nwe would have needed to have done.\n\n432\n00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.190\nSays there are no solutions\nin the solution store.\n\n433\n00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:55.860\nSo first we have to use\na PowerShell commandlet.\n\n434\n00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:00.400\nSo remember there's certain things\nnowadays you cannot do with the GUI,\n\n435\n00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.420\nyou must do via a PowerShell commandlet.\n\n436\n00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:08.160\nDon't be afraid,\nit's a user friendly language.\n\n437\n00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.878\nIt uses commandlets so\nalways a verb-noun combination,\n\n438\n00:26:13.878 --> 00:26:16.830\nin this case add hyphen SP solution.\n\n439\n00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.810\n>> They really do try to make it easy for\nus.\n\n440\n00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:21.180\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n441\n00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.439\nI mean we're not devs.\n\n442\n00:26:23.439 --> 00:26:27.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And they realize that.\n\n443\n00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.020\nAll right, so\nthe add SP solution commandlet, we put\n\n444\n00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:35.150\nthe package in the solution store and from\nthere we can enable it at the farm level.\n\n445\n00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:39.350\nAnd it could be a functionality that\ndownstream of the site collection level,\n\n446\n00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:43.150\na site administrator or site collection\nadministrator may choose to leave ridge or\n\n447\n00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:43.890\ntake advantage,\n\n448\n00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.700\nuse that functionality provided by\nthe solution at the farm level.\n\n449\n00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:53.370\nAll right, and there's a reference to\nthe Microsoft SharePoint foundation\n\n450\n00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:58.320\nsolution developer kit as well which\nis definitely beyond the scope\n\n451\n00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.750\nof this course so\nlet's look at user solutions next.\n\n452\n00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:12.900\nThis is all about actually blocking\nuser solutions potentially.\n\n453\n00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:18.710\nSo sandboxed code we talked about\na little bit in another episode.\n\n454\n00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:23.280\nThis is a way of allowing some\nfunctionality to be introduced to our farm\n\n455\n00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.800\nwithout the risk of\noverwhelming farm resources.\n\n456\n00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:32.430\nAnd we have units that per 24 hour period,\na certain amount of CPU and\n\n457\n00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:37.260\nRAM, there's a secret sauce, I think there\nis 37 different factors that go into\n\n458\n00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:41.790\ntotal impact on a share\npoint farm environment.\n\n459\n00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:47.060\nSo we can say, you get 25 units per 24\nhour period to run this application or\n\n460\n00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.490\nthe sandbox code.\n\n461\n00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:54.860\nThat way the code could run and there's no\nrisk of overwhelming other processes of\n\n462\n00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.410\nwhich there are dozens that need to happen\nregularly in a SharePoint environment.\n\n463\n00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:04.336\nSo we could choose to block\na solution here or allow.\n\n464\n00:28:04.336 --> 00:28:08.940\nAlright, that's sandbox solutions,\n\n465\n00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.900\nthat's something that a dev\nwould be more interested in.\n\n466\n00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:16.940\nThey would design the solution then\nwe as farm administrators would\n\n467\n00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:22.180\nchose how to allow it,\nif we're going to allow it and what total\n\n468\n00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:25.806\npercentage of resources if you like, that\nwe'll allow for this particular solution.\n\n469\n00:28:25.806 --> 00:28:28.819\nPrivacy options.\n\n470\n00:28:32.616 --> 00:28:33.285\nLet's look at those.\n\n471\n00:28:33.285 --> 00:28:35.385\nOkay, this is a customer\nimprovement program,\n\n472\n00:28:35.385 --> 00:28:37.640\ncustomer experience improvement program.\n\n473\n00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.710\nNow unfortunately the NSA, they\nadmitted that one of the ways they were\n\n474\n00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:44.450\ngetting data was from something\nlike this from Microsoft or\n\n475\n00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:46.050\nactually it was with error reports.\n\n476\n00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.370\nThey were intercepting error reports and\n\n477\n00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:51.210\nusing it as a way in\nto gather information.\n\n478\n00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:56.580\nSo that's the world we live in.\n\n479\n00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.500\nI like to participate in these things,\nyou may have a policy in\n\n480\n00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:03.350\nyour organization that you don't send\nsolutions automatically to Microsoft and\n\n481\n00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:08.890\nyou don't participate in the customer\nexperience improvement program but\n\n482\n00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:10.920\nyou do get the network effect.\n\n483\n00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.420\nThe more people that participate,\n\n484\n00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:18.290\nthe more Microsoft is able to prioritize\nwhat issues are people having that we\n\n485\n00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:22.620\nshould address, how are people\nusing their SharePoint environment,\n\n486\n00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:27.210\ncan we tweak some settings or\nsome resource allocation based on usage?\n\n487\n00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:31.440\nSo there's some compelling reasons that\nif you imagine hundreds of thousands of\n\n488\n00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:36.630\nSharePoint deployments reporting in some\nnon-identifiable use data, then in that\n\n489\n00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:43.290\ncase everyone would benefit by Microsoft\nprioritizing some fixes or improvements.\n\n490\n00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:47.940\n>> It's really a shame that they\nhad that happen because you want to\n\n491\n00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:50.890\nparticipate in these because it makes\na better product force in the end.\n\n492\n00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.734\nBut then you find out that somebody\nmight be farming that data and\n\n493\n00:29:53.734 --> 00:29:55.440\nit kinda makes you leery.\n\n494\n00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.230\nReal shame there.\n\n495\n00:29:56.230 --> 00:30:00.880\nMark, I know we've got more to go over\nwhen it comes to our farm base settings.\n\n496\n00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.160\nBut unfortunately we're out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n497\n00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.770\nSo we're gonna have to come back and\n\n498\n00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.380\ndo another part to continue\non with our farm settings.\n\n499\n00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.630\nI hope everybody out there\nhas enjoyed it so far.\n\n500\n00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:10.910\nMake sure you come back for part three.\n\n501\n00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:12.890\nSigning off for now, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n502\n00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:13.490\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n503\n00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:15.182\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n504\n00:30:15.182 --> 00:30:23.300\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:12.428 --> 00:00:15.332\nHello, and welcome to another\nexciting episode here at IT Pro TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.332 --> 00:00:16.956\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.956 --> 00:00:19.161\nToday we're doing share point 2016, and\n\n5\n00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:22.961\nspecifically in this episode we're gonna\nbe continuing our thought process.\n\n6\n00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:26.220\nWe've already started\nconfiguring our farm settings.\n\n7\n00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.580\nOnce we got Share Point installed\nwe've got more settings to cover.\n\n8\n00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.990\nSo here to go over those with us is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n9\n00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.130\nHow's it going Mark?\n\n10\n00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.450\n>> Thank you, Mike.\n\n11\n00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.040\nAll right, the long and continuing journey\nof Share Point farm settings continues.\n\n12\n00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.490\nIn a different episode we were\ntalking about Privacy options, so\n\n13\n00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.740\nwe could see by screen in\na little box up there please.\n\n14\n00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.910\nThat would be awesome, thank you.\n\n15\n00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.010\nOkay, so\ncustomer experience approval program.\n\n16\n00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.580\nAgain, the more, if you participate,\nthen if it's everybody error reporting.\n\n17\n00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.480\nYeah, you may want to\ncollect error reports but\n\n18\n00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.470\njust use them internally and\nperiodically you can have it.\n\n19\n00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.230\nIt's set up with its check box\nselected that you can, it'll download\n\n20\n00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.130\nautomatically some potential solutions,\nissues you might be having from Microsoft.\n\n21\n00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.639\nIf you leave the settings as they are now,\n\n22\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.170\nthe second check box here under\nMicrosoft Error Reporting.\n\n23\n00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.750\nError reports automatically\nwill get sent to Microsoft and\n\n24\n00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.250\nthe usual disclaimer applies.\n\n25\n00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.985\nThey won't, if they discover,\nif they inadvertently collect personal\n\n26\n00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:39.600\ninformation,they're not gonna use it to\nspam you, you know pitching you software.\n\n27\n00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.160\nSo this way,\nthere's no prompting of users.\n\n28\n00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.120\nWhether you might have seen with\nother Microsoft technologies.\n\n29\n00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.070\nA dialog box asking, do you want to send\nerror reports to Microsoft now, yes or no?\n\n30\n00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.700\nSo again,\nit's good to at least collect the errors,\n\n31\n00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.910\neven if you keep them internal.\n\n32\n00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.400\nThe default is to send the error\nreports automatically to Microsoft\n\n33\n00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.040\nwithout prompting.\n\n34\n00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.470\nAnd again, this helps Microsoft make a\nbetter product so you'll benefit that way.\n\n35\n00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.650\nAnd then there is an option there for\nhelp or\n\n36\n00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.900\nmore help if you leave it on yes, so there\nthe help provides an external website.\n\n37\n00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.520\nSo in the other words,\n\n38\n00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.090\nif you want to get out to tech net\nin response to certain errors.\n\n39\n00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.190\nNow there's still some errors that\nfrankly, it's kind of annoying because it\n\n40\n00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.380\ngives you an error message with what looks\nlike a helpful link, or even an event ID.\n\n41\n00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.905\nYou click on that, and it goes nowhere.\n\n42\n00:02:33.905 --> 00:02:36.030\n[LAUGH] Or it's not populated.\n\n43\n00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.020\nSo it's a theoretical help file\nthat doesn't actually exist.\n\n44\n00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.710\n>> One day.\n\n45\n00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.570\nFuture functionality.\n\n46\n00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.430\n>> Yeah.\nFutureware.\n\n47\n00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.230\nFutureware.\n\n48\n00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.510\nAll right.\n\n49\n00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.420\nSo that hasn't changed.\n\n50\n00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.090\nNow, that's all I want to say there.\n\n51\n00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.800\nSo let's go to monitoring now.\n\n52\n00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.370\nSo we're in Central Admin.\n\n53\n00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.830\nWe're just taking a overview of\n[INAUDIBLE] level settings before we get\n\n54\n00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.920\ninto other kinds of content lower down\nthe [INAUDIBLE] hierarchy if you like.\n\n55\n00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.510\nSo health analyzer often ,you'll see\n\n56\n00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.380\na bar across the top of\nthe central admin's site.\n\n57\n00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.040\nI'll go back there now just to point\nthis out in the gold bar there,\n\n58\n00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.340\ncritical issues that require attention.\n\n59\n00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.820\nNow that is a bit of crying wolf, it's\nnot like the farm is gonna break down.\n\n60\n00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.910\nBut, the point is there is a link there,\nor we can get it from the monitoring link.\n\n61\n00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.210\nAlso if you notice, there's a helpful tool\ntip if you hover over different sections.\n\n62\n00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.950\nOr even links within the sections in case\nyou forget what the link is actually for.\n\n63\n00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.150\nIt will help you out as opposed\nto having click the link and\n\n64\n00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.490\nthen realize that's not where\nI want to be and go back.\n\n65\n00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:55.020\nSo let's go into health analyzer this.\n\n66\n00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.870\nI think there was a sequel to that movie.\n\n67\n00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.650\n>> I think so.\n\n68\n00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.880\n>> Anyway, I digress.\n\n69\n00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.110\nWe're loading, and\nwe can see the circle there on the tab.\n\n70\n00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.790\nA little less prominent than before so\n\n71\n00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.580\nyou might start wondering do\nI have to click it again?\n\n72\n00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.900\nBut no, so check your tab.\n\n73\n00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.630\nCheck your browser tab for\nthat little circle rolling around,\n\n74\n00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.530\nthat's how you know that\nsomething is in fact happening.\n\n75\n00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.310\n>> So it says.\n\n76\n00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.640\n>> Yes, oxygen is flowing though\nyour bag might not inflate.\n\n77\n00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.175\n>> That's right.\n\n78\n00:04:25.175 --> 00:04:30.400\n[LAUGH] I have noticed\nsometimes with SharePoint,\n\n79\n00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.280\nsometimes the first time you open a page\nlike especially right after you install.\n\n80\n00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.340\nIt takes a little bit to get\nthat page up and running.\n\n81\n00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.620\nBut once you've been there a few times or\nsomething,\n\n82\n00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.170\nit seems to open them a little bit faster.\n\n83\n00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.300\n>> That's an excellent point, Mike.\n\n84\n00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.260\nSo while we're waiting\nwe can talk about that.\n\n85\n00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.070\nSo there are often dozens of elements\nthat make up a given SharePoint page.\n\n86\n00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.000\nI still don't know why it takes so\nlong for anything to load, but\n\n87\n00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.279\nthe content typically comes\nfrom many different sources.\n\n88\n00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.810\nTemplates, files, etc., web parts.\n\n89\n00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.410\nSo especially for popular sites,\nlike an Intranet site.\n\n90\n00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.800\nLet's say you're a nine to five shop,\nnot a 24/7 global enterprise.\n\n91\n00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.740\nSo you're a nine to five shop,\nlocal or regional,\n\n92\n00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.830\nit's a good idea to have scripts running.\n\n93\n00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.720\nSo they run before the first\nemployee gets to work.\n\n94\n00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.060\nAnd say these things are opens\nup the internet page.\n\n95\n00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.710\nSo then the next the first employee\nin does not to wait two minutes\n\n96\n00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.510\nafter the page to load.\n\n97\n00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.780\nNow the reason why you will might\nexpress slow load time at first,\n\n98\n00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.400\nand then employee comes in to get more\nfaster load because information is cash.\n\n99\n00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.710\nAnd will talk about cash settings this\nweek as well but by running scripts for\n\n100\n00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.440\npopularly accessed pages that way\nyou can eliminate wait time for\n\n101\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.660\nthe early birds.\n\n102\n00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.320\nSo, here's the new problems and\nsolution page now.\n\n103\n00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.730\nSo, current server running low on memory.\n\n104\n00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.415\nHard to believe.\n\n105\n00:05:59.415 --> 00:06:03.730\n[LAUGH] That's sort of an inside joke,\nit's not hard to believe.\n\n106\n00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.470\nSo let's click on that and\nsee what happens.\n\n107\n00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.570\nPresumably there'll be a recommendation.\n\n108\n00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.230\n>> Buy more RAM?\n\n109\n00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.320\n>> Buy more RAM.\n\n110\n00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.450\nHere's a link to the Microsoft\nsponsored Dell memory site.\n\n111\n00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:17.060\nNo.\n\n112\n00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.620\nOkay.\n\n113\n00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.970\nSo, now this is alerts.\n\n114\n00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.110\nWe talked about alerts in a different\nepisode, how we can be notified either\n\n115\n00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.660\nas a user or, in this case, as an admin\nwhen situations require our attention.\n\n116\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.140\nWe can create our own alerts.\n\n117\n00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.540\nEverything in SharePoint is customizable.\n\n118\n00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.640\nStart with out of the box, but\nknow that you can tweak settings.\n\n119\n00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.250\nYou can add your own rules\nyou want to be alerted on.\n\n120\n00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.410\nYou can, modify existing alert rules.\n\n121\n00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.300\nSo, notice how I have\nthe ability right here,\n\n122\n00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.780\nin the upper left,\nI'm on the view tab, right now.\n\n123\n00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:50.860\nI can edit the item.\n\n124\n00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.410\nIn other words,\nthis particular alert condition,\n\n125\n00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.730\nthe server's running low on memory.\n\n126\n00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:03.240\nMicrosoft has classified this as\na severity level of two or Warning.\n\n127\n00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.690\nBut you know what,\nI might say this is not.\n\n128\n00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.790\nI'm going to call this\nan informational kind of error, so\n\n129\n00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.900\na lower severity level of three.\n\n130\n00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.600\nAnd there's also different categories\nthat the air relates to, it\n\n131\n00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.230\ncould be a configuration issue, a security\nissue, performance, or availability.\n\n132\n00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.270\nOr I could even customize and\ncreate my own category if I wanted, and\n\n133\n00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.850\nI could even modify the explanation.\n\n134\n00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.760\nNow the remedy is very useful.\n\n135\n00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.520\nThink of it like knowledge base\ninformation which you might have seen with\n\n136\n00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.320\nsystem center, operations manager,\nfor example, SCOM.\n\n137\n00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.111\nSo it's not just that the management\npack for SharePoint, for example,\n\n138\n00:07:43.111 --> 00:07:46.122\nwill alert you when a condition\nrequires your attention.\n\n139\n00:07:46.122 --> 00:07:50.022\nThat's good, it's even better\nif there's prescribed guidance,\n\n140\n00:07:50.022 --> 00:07:53.261\nhow to solve the issue, so\nknowledge base information.\n\n141\n00:07:53.261 --> 00:07:58.061\nThat's the kind of information we could\nput or modify in the remedy section, so\n\n142\n00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:01.655\npretty obvious if the alert is low RAM,\ncheck your memory.\n\n143\n00:08:01.655 --> 00:08:03.119\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n144\n00:08:03.119 --> 00:08:06.300\n>> You may not be able to add more,\nbut you can at least check that.\n\n145\n00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.030\nMaybe you're maxed out with your\nhardware so maybe you wanna think about\n\n146\n00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.830\nmigrating to a better hardware or\nsplitting up rules.\n\n147\n00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:19.560\nIf you've got an all in one\nconfiguration like we do for this demo,\n\n148\n00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.080\nmaybe it's time to get a separate\nSQL server for your backend.\n\n149\n00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.590\nFor example, maybe an application,\nmiddle tier application server,\n\n150\n00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.600\nseparate web frontend server,\nso divide up the roles.\n\n151\n00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.130\nAnd then it tells us which\nthe failing server was,\n\n152\n00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.980\nwhich was Server 01 And\nwhich service was failing.\n\n153\n00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:45.030\nAll right.\nSo again, we can modify alert conditions.\n\n154\n00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.490\nWe can also add our own.\n\n155\n00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.970\nSo I will close out of this.\n\n156\n00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.300\nNow I could also,\nchoose to reanalysed now.\n\n157\n00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.640\nSo let's say I made some change,\n\n158\n00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.119\nI could choose to reanalysed,\nsee if this alert condition still exists.\n\n159\n00:09:04.119 --> 00:09:04.980\n>> Nice.\n\n160\n00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.890\n>> So we can get the green light\nthere that everything is tickety-boo.\n\n161\n00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.320\nWhat happens if I click new item?\n\n162\n00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.550\nOkay, this is how I create\na new alert condition.\n\n163\n00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:18.330\nSo again, just the sections that\nwe looked at on the existing\n\n164\n00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.630\nalert rule we can set\nup there with new item.\n\n165\n00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.358\nThere's also a little reports link here.\n\n166\n00:09:26.945 --> 00:09:29.099\nSo let's see what happens\nwhen we click on that one.\n\n167\n00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.240\nWe get nothing.\n\n168\n00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.800\n>> Hm.\n>> All right, so then the ability.\n\n169\n00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.930\nSo you're gonna see.\n\n170\n00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:38.180\nIf you've worked with SharePoint 2013\nyou'll be familiar with this concept of\n\n171\n00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.070\nellipses.\n\n172\n00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:41.510\nSo that's the plural of ellipsis.\n\n173\n00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:45.440\nEllipsis is you might recall from your\nEnglish essays, or I don't know tweets or\n\n174\n00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.330\nFacebook posts.\n\n175\n00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.300\nLittle three dots.\n\n176\n00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:53.020\nThat is called an ellipsis, and\noften we're clicking on that.\n\n177\n00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.120\nSometimes you click on the ellipses, and\n\n178\n00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.120\nthen the dialogue box that\nopens has another ellipses.\n\n179\n00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.540\nSo just get used to that.\n\n180\n00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.770\nDot dot dot.\n\n181\n00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:06.190\nIf you're not familiar with it already.\n\n182\n00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.890\nLet's go back into monitoring\nactually to make sure.\n\n183\n00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.000\nYeah, we got more to do.\n\n184\n00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.150\nSo rule definitions we just looked at.\n\n185\n00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.830\nNow, timer jobs.\n\n186\n00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.320\nIn a different episode, we talked about\nthe incredible importance of timer jobs,\n\n187\n00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.370\nbecause there are so many routine tasks.\n\n188\n00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.070\nJust like there would be with\na SQL database, and by the way,\n\n189\n00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.320\nthose can take care of themselves\nin your SharePoint contacts,\n\n190\n00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.380\nrestoring almost everything in SQL.\n\n191\n00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.800\nSo we're just talking about\nSharePoint specific share timer jobs.\n\n192\n00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.420\nNow actually some of\nthose do include sequel.\n\n193\n00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.470\nBut the point is there is routine tasks.\n\n194\n00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.860\nSome of them happen every several minutes.\n\n195\n00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.920\nOthers hourly, daily,\nweekly, monthly, etcetera.\n\n196\n00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.950\nSo let's check out the job definitions for\nour various timer jobs.\n\n197\n00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.550\nSo again, if you had to do them yourself,\nit would be a full time task.\n\n198\n00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.390\nSo the more we can automate, the better.\n\n199\n00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:57.040\nSo here's for example,\nwe have audit log trimming.\n\n200\n00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.950\nWe don't want our log files to grow to big\n\n201\n00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.050\nbecause it will overwhelm\nour storage resources.\n\n202\n00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.640\nSo, although then again,\n\n203\n00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.650\nyou may have a requirement that you're\nnot allowed to do circular logging.\n\n204\n00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:13.900\nIn other words the latest error or\naudit information overriding the oldest.\n\n205\n00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.740\nIn which case you have to take\nsome action to save audit logs and\n\n206\n00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.320\ntaken them off your hard drive there.\n\n207\n00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.770\nSo we're just going to generality,\n\n208\n00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.870\nwe're not going to cover\nevery specific timer job.\n\n209\n00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.560\nBut notice how in the right hand\ncolumn under audit log trimming,\n\n210\n00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.210\nit is a monthly timer task Right.\n\n211\n00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:32.920\nI think I might have.\n\n212\n00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.330\n>> If we can pop that out maybe and\nget rid of that box.\n\n213\n00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:36.420\nWe're covering up some of that.\n\n214\n00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.740\nThere we go.\n>> Yeah, who's that guy there?\n\n215\n00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.310\nGood.\nMuch better.\n\n216\n00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:39.730\nPerfect face for radio.\n\n217\n00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:40.720\nOkay.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n218\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.880\n>> SharePoint is the star.\n\n219\n00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.620\nLet's full screen it, which you just did.\n\n220\n00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.870\nExcellent, thank you.\n\n221\n00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.800\nSo auto log trimming,\nthe web applications so\n\n222\n00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.129\nremember we could have multiple web apps.\n\n223\n00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:55.185\nThis week we will show you haw to\ncreate web applications as well.\n\n224\n00:11:55.185 --> 00:12:00.940\nBut did we just it's a monthly task,\nsomething that happens once a month.\n\n225\n00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.260\nOther tasks are, for example,\na workflow task processing.\n\n226\n00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.860\nWorkflow task processing\nthat is a daily task.\n\n227\n00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:13.060\nOkay, let's look down here.\n\n228\n00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.270\nHere's a database\nperformance metric provider.\n\n229\n00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:22.260\nThis happens at a frequency\nmore than once an hour.\n\n230\n00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:27.460\nJob history there, that's a daily task,\nwe've got some timing\n\n231\n00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.810\nreports that are disabled so\nthat We could enable them.\n\n232\n00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.950\nFor example, to get diagnostic\ndata about SQL blocking, or\n\n233\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:41.900\ndeadlocks, quota warnings\nare other timer jobs.\n\n234\n00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.770\nSo a dizzying array.\n\n235\n00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:49.070\nIn fact, there's so many timer jobs,\nthey can't even fit on the first hundred,\n\n236\n00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.730\nthe first page shows a hundred.\n\n237\n00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:55.590\nSo let's click to the second page,\nand there are many more.\n\n238\n00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:59.270\nSo, for example, password managements,\n\n239\n00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:05.130\na lot of timer jobs related to project\nservice, so there's as you'd expect\n\n240\n00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.990\ngreat tight integration between\nShare Point and Project.\n\n241\n00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:15.280\nThis isn't a project server class, that\nwould easily be an entire week in itself.\n\n242\n00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:21.050\nAll right, query logging,\nBI or business intelligence,\n\n243\n00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:26.420\nmaintenance, all kinds of timer jobs\nrelating to the user profile service.\n\n244\n00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:31.140\nSo this is how we can surface or expose\ninformation about ourselves to other users\n\n245\n00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:35.120\nin our SharePoint environment, so\nlots of jobs relating to user profiles.\n\n246\n00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:39.570\nFor example synchronizing\nfrom active directory and\n\n247\n00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:43.680\nthere is also language specific\nsynchronization tasks you might be\n\n248\n00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.890\nin a multi language environment\nvideo query rule permission.\n\n249\n00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:52.300\nAnd so, all kind of different timer\njobs I don't wanna be label the point.\n\n250\n00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.480\n>> A lot of them.\n\n251\n00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.770\n>> Yeah, now on the left hand side\nthere in the quick launch area,\n\n252\n00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.430\nwe have timer jobs status link.\n\n253\n00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:03.430\nSo, I'll click on that.\n\n254\n00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:09.590\nOkay.\nSo, these show the status of timer jobs\n\n255\n00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:13.070\nthat have, we have three sections here.\n\n256\n00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.490\nI'll scroll down a bit to show history.\n\n257\n00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.530\nSo, these are timer jobs\nthat have recently run.\n\n258\n00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:19.220\nMm hm.\n\n259\n00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:25.240\nSo things like user profile\nservice app synchronization there.\n\n260\n00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.110\nIf I scroll up a bit, we can see there are\nactually no timer jobs running right now.\n\n261\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.630\nSo there's a running section.\n\n262\n00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:38.440\nAnd then, at the top is the scheduled\ntimer job status section, these show.\n\n263\n00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.240\nTimer Jobs that are in the que to start up\nand the time at which their due to start.\n\n264\n00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.450\nSo things like health\nstatistics upgrading,\n\n265\n00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.000\nmigration jobs, project server jobs.\n\n266\n00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.040\nSo we can get a sense of what timer jobs\nare coming and what have recently run.\n\n267\n00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:02.440\nThere's also a link for Currently Running\nJobs, if I just want to focus in on those.\n\n268\n00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.370\nSeparate link for\nScheduled Jobs and Job History.\n\n269\n00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:11.760\nSo we can see them all at once, by\nsection or on their own individual page.\n\n270\n00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.320\nThere's also a Job Definitions page for\ntimer jobs.\n\n271\n00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.120\nWhat happens if I click on, for\n\n272\n00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.260\nexample, change log which is set\nup as a weekly timer job task.\n\n273\n00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.070\nHere's where I can change the schedule.\n\n274\n00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:30.540\nNow, I'd highly recommend do not modify\ndefault schedules at least at first.\n\n275\n00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.570\nThere may be some compelling reason where\nsome timer job that relates to some custom\n\n276\n00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:39.490\nfunctionality and you may want to adjust\nthe frequency of that job running.\n\n277\n00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:44.855\nBut leave the defaults alone,\nsomehow like leave Britney alone.\n\n278\n00:15:44.855 --> 00:15:47.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sorry,\n\n279\n00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.785\neverything reminds you of something else,\nokay.\n\n280\n00:15:49.785 --> 00:15:51.151\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let us leave Virginia alone, but\n\n281\n00:15:51.151 --> 00:15:52.716\nthat's but that's another whole story.\n\n282\n00:15:52.716 --> 00:15:56.982\nSo I can change from a weekly task\nright now, it's scheduled for\n\n283\n00:15:56.982 --> 00:15:59.275\nSaturday night at 11 o'clock.\n\n284\n00:15:59.275 --> 00:16:02.209\nI can change that, you can see there,\n\n285\n00:16:02.209 --> 00:16:07.920\nto a different frequency from every x\nnumber of minutes to a monthly task.\n\n286\n00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.851\nIt also shows, let's say I'm expecting\nsome timer job and some performance or\n\n287\n00:16:12.851 --> 00:16:16.911\nsomething to have been accomplished,\nand it doesn't get done.\n\n288\n00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:22.730\nThen I can go into the timer job and it'll\nshow me the last time the timer job ran.\n\n289\n00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:27.560\nSo it's a troubleshooting tool\nas opposed to wading through\n\n290\n00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:32.010\nsay event viewer logs that you may not\nbe exactly sure what you're looking for.\n\n291\n00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:33.030\nYou go right to the source.\n\n292\n00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:37.330\nThis timer job was supposed to have done\nthis task, that task has not happened,\n\n293\n00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.040\nI was expecting it to\nhave happened last night.\n\n294\n00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.320\nI can go right into the timer job,\nit'll show me the last run time,\n\n295\n00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.000\nat this point N/A.\n\n296\n00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.560\nThat's not North America, that means\nnot applicable, it's never run yet.\n\n297\n00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:52.020\nThis is a new SharePoint deployment so\nnot all of the tasks will run because\n\n298\n00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.630\nsome of them are monthly or\nweekly tasks, or daily.\n\n299\n00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:56.910\nIt just might not have run yet.\n\n300\n00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:01.480\nSo that's how you get into an individual\njob definition for the hundreds, or\n\n301\n00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.880\npotentially certainly dozens,\nof regular timer jobs.\n\n302\n00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.110\n>> Really convenient that they'll\nlet you change that schedule.\n\n303\n00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:10.800\nLike you said, probably important\nthat a lot of those built-in\n\n304\n00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.708\ntimer jobs are important to SharePoint and\nits functionality.\n\n305\n00:17:13.708 --> 00:17:15.260\nWe don't wanna just turn them off or\n\n306\n00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.690\nanything but there is one that\nschedule to go 11:00 on Saturday and\n\n307\n00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.890\nthat happens to be right in\nthe middle of my maintenance window.\n\n308\n00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.480\nSo maybe we move that to 9:00.\n\n309\n00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.380\nWe didn't stop it,\nwe didn't change the frequency but\n\n310\n00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.020\nwe alter the time that it's executing.\n\n311\n00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.980\n>> Excellent point, so\nwe have that flexibility.\n\n312\n00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.800\nBut again leave the defaults at first.\n\n313\n00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.750\nThere's need to be a compelling reason\nto why you wanna change the time for\n\n314\n00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:38.380\na job frequency but\nat least you know now how to do that.\n\n315\n00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:39.280\n>> Perfect.\n\n316\n00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.630\n>> All right let's go on to security now.\n\n317\n00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.390\nSo this is another major section\nof our farm administration.\n\n318\n00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:50.080\nNow users so I've implored you to consider\n\n319\n00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.190\nminimizing membership in\nthe farm administrators group.\n\n320\n00:17:55.190 --> 00:18:00.040\nMaybe it's one person, maybe two is\nbetter, the old hit by the bus scenario.\n\n321\n00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:05.420\nSo we got the built-in admins group is\nautomatically a farm administrator.\n\n322\n00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.690\nYou can remove that.\n\n323\n00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:11.740\nRight now I've got ACME, ACME\nadministrator is a farm administrator.\n\n324\n00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:19.920\nAnd I can add a new user from this drop\ndown menu here, there's an actions menu.\n\n325\n00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.820\nSo I can not only email one or\n\n326\n00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.090\nmore of these group members,\nin the Farm Admin group.\n\n327\n00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.880\nI can also call or\nmessage them, hm, that's cool.\n\n328\n00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.060\nAnd then I can remove\nthe users from the group.\n\n329\n00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:36.050\nThe Settings here,\nI can modify group permissions.\n\n330\n00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.280\nI definitely don't wanna do this on\na Farm Administrators group, but\n\n331\n00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.340\nthese same kinds of principles apply\nin any SharePoint group we may look at,\n\n332\n00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:48.080\nthe ability to contact one or\nall of them to modify permissions.\n\n333\n00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.110\nWe can also check out settings,\nother settings there.\n\n334\n00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.530\nMore of which we'll get into when we talk\nabout our site collection administration.\n\n335\n00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.220\nSo, I'm not gonna go into if you're\nwondering why I just skipped over\n\n336\n00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:58.970\nsome of that.\n\n337\n00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.370\nThat's why,\nwe're gonna cover it in more detail later.\n\n338\n00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:06.010\nSo this, same principles apply no\nmatter what group you are populating or\n\n339\n00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:08.350\ndepopulating in a SharePoint context.\n\n340\n00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:13.690\nAnd okay so,\nas a farm admin I can approve or\n\n341\n00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:17.520\nreject a request to form\na distribution group.\n\n342\n00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.040\nYou may want control over that.\n\n343\n00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.950\nYou may not want to let just anybody\ncreate a distribution group,\n\n344\n00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.665\nespecially if it's one that\nincludes everybody in the firm.\n\n345\n00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:27.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's been some embarrassing\n\n346\n00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:32.390\nscenarios in the past where\nthe wrong email went to everybody\n\n347\n00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:35.940\ninstead of one person, or\nthe wrong distribution group, for example.\n\n348\n00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:40.960\nSo, If you want to have the ability\nto approve distribution groups,\n\n349\n00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.010\nthis is where you would allow or\n\n350\n00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:48.860\ndeny the request to create\nthat new distribution group.\n\n351\n00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.180\nOkay.\n\n352\n00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.220\nWhat else do we have here?\n\n353\n00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.319\nWe have the web app user policy.\n\n354\n00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:56.741\nOkay, so.\n\n355\n00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:02.680\nNow, we're talking about\nfarm administration.\n\n356\n00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.640\nBelow the farm level,\nwe have Web Applications.\n\n357\n00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:11.760\nSo a Web App, just as a review,\nis an IS website that's been extended.\n\n358\n00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:16.110\nOr in other words, functionality\nhas been enhanced to allow for\n\n359\n00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:21.700\nSharePoint specific items like,\nsite collections, and sites, and so on.\n\n360\n00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.100\nSo, this hasn't changed.\n\n361\n00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.870\nOften, you might be making a change.\n\n362\n00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.850\nSo, we got farm level settings,\nbelow that, we have one or\n\n363\n00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.715\nmore web applications,\nthroughout the farm.\n\n364\n00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.179\nWe can change settings\non a per web app basis.\n\n365\n00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.225\nMake sure you're making a change\non the correct web application.\n\n366\n00:20:42.225 --> 00:20:44.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I would personally like,\n\n367\n00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.470\nnobody asked me, but\nI would like this to be more prominent.\n\n368\n00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.560\nOver here on the right hand side,\nit says web application.\n\n369\n00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.880\nIf I click on that link,\n\n370\n00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.900\nthen I have a drop down option\nto change web application.\n\n371\n00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.420\nAnd I'll say yes there.\n\n372\n00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.430\nNow at this point,\nI only have one web app.\n\n373\n00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:07.148\nThat's the default SharePoint 80, 80\nstanding for port 80 and here's the url.\n\n374\n00:21:07.148 --> 00:21:11.220\nIf I had one or more additional web apps,\n\n375\n00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:17.660\nhere's where I could choose which web app\nthat I wanted to make settings changes to.\n\n376\n00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.550\nI have no choices here,\nI have the choice of one.\n\n377\n00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:22.930\nI'll choose that one.\n\n378\n00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:23.510\n>> Good choice.\n\n379\n00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:24.085\n>> Yes, thank you.\n\n380\n00:21:24.085 --> 00:21:26.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It feels like the right choice.\n\n381\n00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:31.480\nSo for example you might not get,\nthat this applies to\n\n382\n00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:36.540\nother places where you can change settings\nrelating to a particular web app only.\n\n383\n00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.110\nThere's going to be a drop down.\n\n384\n00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.570\nSo make sure you're working\nin the correct web app.\n\n385\n00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:45.850\nOne clue that you're not in the correct\nweb app that you want to make changes to\n\n386\n00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.780\nis the list of whatever is\npopulated on the screen.\n\n387\n00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.210\nYou might say, wait a minute.\n\n388\n00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:51.100\nThis doesn't look right.\n\n389\n00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.600\nThis isn't the list of\nitems I was expecting.\n\n390\n00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.980\nThe first thing to do would\nbe check if you're working or\n\n391\n00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.390\nlooking at information pertaining\nto the correct Web application.\n\n392\n00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:06.720\nOkay.\nSo, let's say I click on the Web Crawl\n\n393\n00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:12.901\naccount here, so\nmaybe I want to change a permission here.\n\n394\n00:22:12.901 --> 00:22:16.310\nNow, there's a couple different\npermission policy levels,\n\n395\n00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:19.870\nso these permissions pertain\nto the entire Web application.\n\n396\n00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:24.420\nThat means it includes,\ncan affect all the site collections,\n\n397\n00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:29.060\nall the sites and sub-sites that\nare hosted within the web application.\n\n398\n00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:33.180\nSo the permission policy levels are less,\n\n399\n00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:38.370\nthere's less policy levels to choose\nfrom at the web application level.\n\n400\n00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:41.690\nWe get much more granular control\nat the site collection level and\n\n401\n00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:44.470\nthe site level,\nwhich we'll be talking about this week.\n\n402\n00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:49.260\nSo they're more broad strokes if you like,\npermission policy levels.\n\n403\n00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.330\nFor example, full control.\n\n404\n00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:55.890\nFull read is a bit misleading isn't it\nbecause full and read we kind of think of\n\n405\n00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:59.120\nopposite ends of the spectrum in\nterms of freedom and restrictions.\n\n406\n00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:04.229\nThere is also deny, so\ndeny takes precedence.\n\n407\n00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:10.300\nand we'll talk more about permission\nlevels, custom permissions, conflicting\n\n408\n00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.110\nsettings, when we talk about site\ncollection settings later in the week.\n\n409\n00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.080\nAnd that's all I want to show you there.\n\n410\n00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.010\nThat happened to be\nthe search crawling account.\n\n411\n00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:22.380\nSo You might have more\nthan one crawling account,\n\n412\n00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.080\nremember I said I would jump around a bit.\n\n413\n00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.090\nSo in terms of crawling for\ncontent that means\n\n414\n00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:31.458\nwe're looking at content we wanna\nindex and then make searchable.\n\n415\n00:23:31.458 --> 00:23:36.898\nThe search crawl account must have\npermissions, must have read permission\n\n416\n00:23:36.898 --> 00:23:42.603\nto whatever content it's looking at,\notherwise it can't crawl the content.\n\n417\n00:23:42.603 --> 00:23:48.806\nSome organizations for a very sensitive\ncontent like finance server, hr server\n\n418\n00:23:48.806 --> 00:23:55.113\ninformation they might have a dedicated\ncrawl account just for that data source.\n\n419\n00:23:55.113 --> 00:24:00.206\nAnd then they give just the bare minimum\npermissions to that special account,\n\n420\n00:24:00.206 --> 00:24:03.120\njust to crawl say the finance or\nHR servers.\n\n421\n00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.145\nOr some line of business database for\nexample.\n\n422\n00:24:06.145 --> 00:24:07.410\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n423\n00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.010\n>> So we've got a lot to talk about\nin the realm of search as well,\n\n424\n00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:13.665\nso I'll just give you a little teaser for\nnow.\n\n425\n00:24:13.665 --> 00:24:16.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that is,\n\n426\n00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.690\nall I want to say on a web app,\nactually, there's more.\n\n427\n00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:19.660\nSo, on the upper left there,\n\n428\n00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.230\nchange anonymous access restrictions,\nI'll click that.\n\n429\n00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:29.210\nAnd this relates to users\nthat are authenticating.\n\n430\n00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.600\nSo, maybe from the web, for example.\n\n431\n00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:36.790\nThey're potential customers and\ndo I want to set up a policy for that?\n\n432\n00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:40.810\nWhen they're accessing any content\nhosted within the web apps so\n\n433\n00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.560\nany site collections or sites.\n\n434\n00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.540\nI can specify no policy deny right or\n\n435\n00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:50.450\ndeny all, so\nthis is generally not necessary.\n\n436\n00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:54.010\nBecause typically anonymous users\nonly have read access anyway, but\n\n437\n00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:58.760\njust know that there's settings you can\napply at the web app level that apply to\n\n438\n00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.450\nall the site collections and sites.\n\n439\n00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:06.020\nSpecifically pertaining to anonymous or\nunauthenticated access.\n\n440\n00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.800\nThere's also a permission policy\nlevels link in the upper right.\n\n441\n00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:14.510\nMore on permission policies.\n\n442\n00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:19.020\nThese are the four policy levels\navailable to us at the web app level.\n\n443\n00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.370\nLet's say again always\ngood to set the defaults,\n\n444\n00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:24.870\nbut let's say there is some combinations.\n\n445\n00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:29.370\nOr some different quality policy level\nyou want to implement you can do that.\n\n446\n00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:31.120\nAnd you can also add policy levels\n\n447\n00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.800\nequivalence at the site\nclose to site level.\n\n448\n00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.850\nBut generally there is enough control Or\n\n449\n00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:43.120\nenough ways to categorize different\nkinds of users and the access they need,\n\n450\n00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.870\nthat you should not need to create\ncustom permission policy levels.\n\n451\n00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:52.326\nIf you want to experiment with it anyway,\nclick on the Add Permission Policy link.\n\n452\n00:25:52.326 --> 00:25:59.100\nAnd then you can give it a name.\n\n453\n00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:04.137\nFor that permission policy level, and then\nyou're gonna specify [COUGH] pardon me.\n\n454\n00:26:04.137 --> 00:26:06.445\nI should've used the kill switch for that.\n\n455\n00:26:06.445 --> 00:26:10.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, here's some of the much more\n\n456\n00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:14.870\ngranular permissions that we'd expect\nto see at the site collection level.\n\n457\n00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:18.660\nAnd notice how they're both grant and\ndeny options.\n\n458\n00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:25.389\nFor options like manage lists,\nthe ability to add items to lists.\n\n459\n00:26:28.029 --> 00:26:31.930\n>> Yeah, it really does give you\na very granular control at this point.\n\n460\n00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:35.320\n>> Indeed, I don't wanna,\nI kinda restrict myself,\n\n461\n00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.610\nI have to throttle myself if you will,\nthrottle the bandwidth here.\n\n462\n00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:40.060\nTo not go into too much detail.\n\n463\n00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:44.600\nBut know there are many\npermissions relating to lists,\n\n464\n00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:49.070\nrelating to site permissions, and\n\n465\n00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.730\nrelating to personal permissions,\nlike the ability to add web parts.\n\n466\n00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.470\nSo we'll go into much more detail about\nall these when we get to our site\n\n467\n00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:57.280\ncollection and site permission levels.\n\n468\n00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.800\nBut just know that at the web app level\nwhich applies to all the same site\n\n469\n00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.230\ncollections sites hosts\nwith in the web app.\n\n470\n00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:07.320\nWe can have a custom permission\npolicy level if necessary.\n\n471\n00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:12.040\nPlease start with the defaults and\nthen add additional level if you need to.\n\n472\n00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.060\nYou shouldn't need to\nat the web app level.\n\n473\n00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:18.010\nThere's more arguments for needing to\ncreate a custom level or collection or\n\n474\n00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:21.268\nsite level,\nwhich we'll discuss In a later episode.\n\n475\n00:27:21.268 --> 00:27:26.460\nAll right,\nthe back button is my friend again.\n\n476\n00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:32.150\nIt wasn't so much my friend in\na different episode earlier.\n\n477\n00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:41.480\nSo that's policies for web apps and\nLet's wrap it up there for now.\n\n478\n00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.260\nBefore I go off for another-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n479\n00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.855\n>> Hour on the next section of security.\n\n480\n00:27:45.855 --> 00:27:47.280\n[LAUGH]\n>> And there really are a lot of\n\n481\n00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.840\nlittle detailed settings that we\ncan get into there that obviously,\n\n482\n00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.760\nwe don't need to know everyone.\n\n483\n00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.620\nWe need to know where they are and\nhow we can configure them.\n\n484\n00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.880\nAnd it sounds like another really big\npoint that we want to draw out of this,\n\n485\n00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.910\nis the fact that we can manage\nall of this at different levels.\n\n486\n00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.480\nWe've gotta keep that\nhierarchy in mind where\n\n487\n00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:08.020\nare we doing things at the farm level\nthat affect the entire share point setup?\n\n488\n00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.300\nAre we doing it at the web application\nlevel that would only affect\n\n489\n00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.540\nevery site collection and\nsite under that web app, but\n\n490\n00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.650\nyou might have separate web\napps that it wouldn't affect.\n\n491\n00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.140\nOr do you get down into\nthe site collection level or\n\n492\n00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.140\neven all the way down into the site level?\n\n493\n00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.800\ndepending on who those permissions or\npolicies or\n\n494\n00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.650\nwhatever it is we're trying to\nfigure is going to apply to.\n\n495\n00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:28.610\nSo you've got to do it at the right point.\n\n496\n00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:32.280\nSimilar to NTFS permissions where we\nalways talk about, do it at the highest\n\n497\n00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.330\nlevel that makes sense, that way you\ndon't have to do it more than once.\n\n498\n00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.620\nEvery one of the site\ncollections in that web app\n\n499\n00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.080\nneeds that setting then do\nit at the webapp right?\n\n500\n00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.500\nBut if only one of the site collections\nwithin the web application needs it\n\n501\n00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.530\nthen do it at that level.\n\n502\n00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:49.970\nVery good Mark well we thank you for\nall that information, great stuff.\n\n503\n00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:51.630\nHope you guys enjoyed

00:00:16.789\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.880\nToday we're doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.230\nAnd more specifically, we're gonna be\nhitting our configuring farm objectives.\n\n6\n00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.180\nWe've already done a couple of episodes\nthat have dealt with doing our farm\n\n7\n00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.760\nsettings, but we have more to go.\n\n8\n00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.770\nSo we're just gonna jump right\nback into it without further ado.\n\n9\n00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.860\nHere's Mr. Mark Ingram,\nhow's it going Mark?\n\n10\n00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.550\n>> Thanks Mike, appreciate that.\n\n11\n00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.941\nAll right, so kin a previous episode,\n\n12\n00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:43.577\nwe were looking at other\nforeign configuration settings.\n\n13\n00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:47.293\nWe're gonna keep going.\nAs was mentioned with now general security\n\n14\n00:00:47.293 --> 00:00:48.270\nsettings.\n\n15\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.040\nSo remember we're in\nour central admin site.\n\n16\n00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.380\nWhich is based on a URL of\nthe server name with a colon and\n\n17\n00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.074\na port number which shows 55555.\n\n18\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.550\n>> Easy to remember.\n>> Yeah, easy to remember.\n\n19\n00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.180\nYou can choose whatever you want.\n\n20\n00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.375\nI thought of 90210 but that was beyond\nthe 64K limit, so that was not allowed.\n\n21\n00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:10.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so in the security section\n\n22\n00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.430\nwe have under general security\nconfiguring managed accounts.\n\n23\n00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.230\nSo, we get right in there.\n\n24\n00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.860\nAnd, here's where I can\nregister a managed account.\n\n25\n00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.520\nManaged accounts, if you recall,\nthat means it's an account,\n\n26\n00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.520\nthat Microsoft managed,\nwe use them for service accounts.\n\n27\n00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.550\nSo, we can participate\nin the domain policy,\n\n28\n00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.980\nof password change, replication frequency,\nsay every four weeks, or every six weeks.\n\n29\n00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.440\nWe don't have to manually change\nthe passwords, the OS takes care of that.\n\n30\n00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.830\nSo we get the benefit of frequently\nchanging passwords without the hassle\n\n31\n00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.050\nof manually changing a password.\n\n32\n00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.084\nSo I'll click on Register Managed Account.\n\n33\n00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:55.080\nActually I'll just show you where\nyou'd enter the fields here.\n\n34\n00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.350\nService Account Credentials,\nso username and password, And\n\n35\n00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.760\nthen here's where it enabled automatic\npassword change with this checkbox.\n\n36\n00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.960\nAnd then I can choose\nto change the password,\n\n37\n00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.910\nx number of days before expiry,\nand then I can specify specifics.\n\n38\n00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.640\nFor example, weekly, or monthly by date.\n\n39\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.850\nOr, I say on the first or the third day of\nevery month, so you've got options there.\n\n40\n00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.700\nI'd say registered managed account.\n\n41\n00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.460\nAnd you might wanna have a separate,\nso now actually because it's so\n\n42\n00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.860\nconvenient these last.\n\n43\n00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.890\nThere's no manual password\nchange requirement,\n\n44\n00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.390\nyou might wanna get the security benefit\nof having separate managed accounts for\n\n45\n00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.830\neach of your service applications.\n\n46\n00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.700\nSo that way again security\nthrough obscurity.\n\n47\n00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.710\nIn a sense your not having one account,\n\n48\n00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.940\nif hacked somehow give access\nto the farm or keys to the farm.\n\n49\n00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.510\nYou might have a compromised access for\none service app or\n\n50\n00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.690\none component of your farm,\nbut not the entire farm.\n\n51\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.200\nSo that's good.\n\n52\n00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.710\nAll right, and next up is service\naccounts, configuring service accounts.\n\n53\n00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.400\nSo there's a dropdown here,\nso various services here, for\n\n54\n00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.390\nexample document conversions.\n\n55\n00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.230\nThere's accounts relating\nto project server.\n\n56\n00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.480\nSandbox code service, we talked about in\nanother episode, a way of isolating, say\n\n57\n00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.790\ncustomized development environment or a\ncertain application, a program that runs.\n\n58\n00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.500\nWe don't want it to overwhelm our\nfarm resources, so it can use some of\n\n59\n00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.391\nthe resources, but we can control how\nmany resources over a 24 hour period.\n\n60\n00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.310\nAnd a web application pool, which we're\nusing now for our current only web app.\n\n61\n00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.660\nI'm gonna show you how to\ncreate a web application soon.\n\n62\n00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.550\nAnd then we specify an account.\n\n63\n00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.520\nSo I have my login account\nwhich is Acme administrator.\n\n64\n00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.920\nAnd I also set up a managed\naccount at time of install,\n\n65\n00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.539\nwhich we showed you in another episode.\n\n66\n00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.850\nSo at this point I could also\nregister a new managed account.\n\n67\n00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.890\nSo sometimes we could do the exact\nsame action, either with a link,\n\n68\n00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.810\nfrom in this page,\nin this case, service accounts,\n\n69\n00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.510\nor, creating new managed accounts has\nits own screen, which we just looked at.\n\n70\n00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.020\nSo I won't create a service account now,\nbut\n\n71\n00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.230\nwe will need them later on in the week.\n\n72\n00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.000\nHere's our password\nchange settings option.\n\n73\n00:04:16.463 --> 00:04:20.945\nAnd this is to notify,\nlet's say I want to be notified when\n\n74\n00:04:20.945 --> 00:04:26.560\npasswords have changed,\neven if I'm not doing them myself.\n\n75\n00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.987\nSo I can get a notification\nwhen that happens.\n\n76\n00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.790\nPassword management.\n\n77\n00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.850\nAll right.\nAnd then authentication providers\n\n78\n00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.660\nis the next section.\n\n79\n00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.517\nNow the default is we've got Claims\nBased Authentication here for each zone.\n\n80\n00:04:45.517 --> 00:04:47.900\nWe talked about zones\nin a different episode,\n\n81\n00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.380\na different vector to get\nto the exact same content.\n\n82\n00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.130\nIntranet zone, Extranet, Internet.\n\n83\n00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.530\nSo we can have one content Copy,\n\n84\n00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.160\nif you like, accessed by different people,\ndifferent ways.\n\n85\n00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.120\nWe can even have different\nauthentication providers.\n\n86\n00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.420\nSo for example, for\nmaybe our vendors or suppliers or\n\n87\n00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.080\npartners, they might authenticate\nthrough forms based authentication.\n\n88\n00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.598\nSo if you've used Outlook Web Access,\n\n89\n00:05:12.598 --> 00:05:15.270\nyou'll know what that's like just\na form that shows up on a web page.\n\n90\n00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.160\nYou enter your user name, password,\nand sometimes you have a public, or\n\n91\n00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.120\nprivate option radio button to choose,\nand you're good to go.\n\n92\n00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.030\nSo, for different populations accessing\nour content from different places, inside\n\n93\n00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.950\nthe firewall, outside the firewall, we can\nhave a different authentication mechanism.\n\n94\n00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.966\nI click on default zone there.\n\n95\n00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.830\nThis gives me my zone information,\n\n96\n00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.170\nand here's where I can enable\nanonymous access if I want.\n\n97\n00:05:43.378 --> 00:05:47.750\nAnd Windows Authentication\nis set as the default\n\n98\n00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.970\nwith Integrated Windows Authentication and\nTLM.\n\n99\n00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.230\nYou could set up a Kerberos environment\nat the time of farm installation and\n\n100\n00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.780\nsetting up your SharePoint farm, is not\nthe time to embark on a Kerberos project.\n\n101\n00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.592\nThat is an entirely separate workflow,\n\n102\n00:06:00.592 --> 00:06:03.480\nan entirely project which\nshould be managed separately.\n\n103\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.070\nBut the point is, you could use\nKerberos authentication if you wanted.\n\n104\n00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.010\nAnd then,\nbasic authentication is an option.\n\n105\n00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.190\nIf you're using HTTPS, that's okay.\n\n106\n00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.070\nAnd here's where you set up for\nforms-based authentication.\n\n107\n00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.624\nAgain like an OWA-type interface.\n\n108\n00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.310\nManaged trust is the next section there.\n\n109\n00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.560\nActually this brings up\na good point which is,\n\n110\n00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.650\nwe're not gonna cover absolutely\neverything in the interface.\n\n111\n00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.150\nWhy?\nBecause we've got a whole other course\n\n112\n00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.925\nwhich is not out yet.\n\n113\n00:06:34.925 --> 00:06:35.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n114\n00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.320\nfeel free to tweet about it at ITProTV.\n\n115\n00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.510\nAdvanced SharePoint configuration course\ncorresponding to that associated exam.\n\n116\n00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.420\nSo we're not gonna cover\neverything here but\n\n117\n00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.841\nI will at least show you almost\nall of what's available.\n\n118\n00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:51.240\nAnd then we'll either talk about it or\nI'll say it's in the advanced course.\n\n119\n00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.761\nHere's antivirus settings link and\nokay, so this is an odd one.\n\n120\n00:06:57.761 --> 00:07:00.025\nThe default setting here the third option,\n\n121\n00:07:00.025 --> 00:07:02.420\nallow users to download\ninfected documents.\n\n122\n00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.078\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Why on earth\n\n123\n00:07:03.078 --> 00:07:04.970\nwould you want to allow that?\n\n124\n00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.100\nMaybe that's the only option you've got,\nin other words the user has to have access\n\n125\n00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.550\nto that document, you don't have it\nbacked up or accessible any other way.\n\n126\n00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:18.244\nSo in that case maybe you're relying\non the desktop antivirus client for\n\n127\n00:07:18.244 --> 00:07:25.000\nyour user to at least protect\nthe computer from that infected document.\n\n128\n00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.469\n>> That does seems a counter\nintuitive there, yes.\n\n129\n00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:27.658\n>> Indeed.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n130\n00:07:27.658 --> 00:07:29.260\n>> So you could prevent that,\n\n131\n00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.400\nin which case you'd have to clean\nup the infection before allowing\n\n132\n00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.120\nusers to download.\n\n133\n00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.040\nOther options which are not selected by\ndefault is the ability to scan documents\n\n134\n00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.910\non upload and or\nto scan documents on download.\n\n135\n00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.690\nNow again you might think why wouldn't\nyou just leave those selected?\n\n136\n00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.520\nWell how many antivirus passes do\nyou need for the same document?\n\n137\n00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.540\nPresumably you've got some\nantivirus when you're coming in.\n\n138\n00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.440\nEither hosted solution, your smart host or\nan enterprise wide solution.\n\n139\n00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.717\nYou've got your other servers in\nyour environment with antivirus,\n\n140\n00:08:01.717 --> 00:08:05.254\nthe client machines have antivirus,\nso You may decide,\n\n141\n00:08:05.254 --> 00:08:09.770\nokay we're not gonna do repetitive\nscanning on our SharePoint server.\n\n142\n00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:17.230\nOr you might allow, you might wanna\nhave an antivirus timeout, so in other\n\n143\n00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:21.880\nwords it will scan on your SharePoint\nserver but it won't go on forever.\n\n144\n00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.590\nSo you can have a timeout\nduration there if you wanted.\n\n145\n00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.900\nAnd these options would appear.\n\n146\n00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:33.330\nSee I've selected the first check box,\nnow scan documents and upload.\n\n147\n00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.260\nNow the bottom two options,\nthe antivirus timeout and\n\n148\n00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.520\nthe number of threads, so you can restrict\nthe processor impact of any AV scans.\n\n149\n00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.220\nSo the default is five.\n\n150\n00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.270\nBut those last two options appear once\nI've selected either scan documents and\n\n151\n00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.560\nupload And/or scan documents on download.\n\n152\n00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.410\nI'll just leave them in the default,\nwhich is not to scan.\n\n153\n00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.520\nDefine block file types.\n\n154\n00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.250\nOkay, remember, you may recall from\nanother session that it's very\n\n155\n00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:04.250\nimportant when we have setting that\npertain to a single web application only,\n\n156\n00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:09.650\nlike this one does, check out the web\napplication list on the right-hand side.\n\n157\n00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:14.210\nTypically and\nif we had more than one web application.\n\n158\n00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:15.520\nWell I'll just show you anyway you might,\n\n159\n00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.460\nwho knows what order you're\nwatching these episodes in.\n\n160\n00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.770\nAnd actually this one is useful because\nwe do have two web apps listed.\n\n161\n00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.120\nWe've got our SharePoint AD\ndefault web app.\n\n162\n00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.720\nWe also have a web app containing our\nSharePoint central admin site which is\n\n163\n00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.740\nthe site we're working on now.\n\n164\n00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.680\nAnd notice how there's\na port number there.\n\n165\n00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.440\nSo if I want to change the web app.\n\n166\n00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.060\nI can only, because these are web app\nspecific settings blog file types.\n\n167\n00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.790\nIf I wanted the same blog file type\nbehavior across my whole enterprise I\n\n168\n00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:50.290\nwould have to make these settings\nchanges at each and every Web app level.\n\n169\n00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.890\nNow you could script this with\nPowerShell if you wanted, but\n\n170\n00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:59.040\nfrom the GUI there's no universal\nway to establish blog file types.\n\n171\n00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.750\nIt's on a per web app basis.\n\n172\n00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.150\nSo I'll just leave it\nat this SharePoint AD.\n\n173\n00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:08.870\nIf I click on SharePoint central admin\nthough then, you can see there on\n\n174\n00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.690\nthe right-hand side, now we see web\napp shows the central admin website.\n\n175\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.720\n>> So it looks like they've got a couple\nscreens where it's very important we pay\n\n176\n00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.570\nattention to what we're\nconfiguring because it might've\n\n177\n00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:24.390\nflipped to the wrong site for\nsome reason or the wrong application.\n\n178\n00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.380\nYou think you're working with,\nsay, that central admin site and\n\n179\n00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.750\nyou're actually working with\nThe developer site, or the HR site, or\n\n180\n00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.070\nsomething like that.\n\n181\n00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:32.352\n>> Right, and they may hate you.\n\n182\n00:10:32.352 --> 00:10:34.004\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Worst case scenario,\n\n183\n00:10:34.004 --> 00:10:35.655\npresumably you're gonna test.\n\n184\n00:10:35.655 --> 00:10:37.940\nYou should always test\nthe effect of a change.\n\n185\n00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.490\nFor example, if we're changing the blocked\nfile types that we're allowing or\n\n186\n00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.740\ndisallowing for web app,\nyou wanna check it out.\n\n187\n00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.810\nCan I in fact upload an XLS file, if for\n\n188\n00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.160\nsome reason that becomes\na blocked file type.\n\n189\n00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.840\nAnd if you can, and you're expected\nto be prevented from doing so,\n\n190\n00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.750\nyou probably made the settings\nchange on the wrong web app.\n\n191\n00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.310\nThis kind of consideration\nmight just refer to,\n\n192\n00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:05.120\nwe have to keep in mind as well When we\nget into our site collection settings and\n\n193\n00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.380\nour site settings, sometimes they\nare overlapping or the same options\n\n194\n00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.680\nat both the site collection level and\nlower down at the site level, so we may\n\n195\n00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.790\nhave made the settings change at the wrong\nlevel and not gotten the behavior we want.\n\n196\n00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:24.970\nOkay so Unfortunately there's\nno way to automatically,\n\n197\n00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:29.630\noops, alphabetize the list\nof block file types.\n\n198\n00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:34.050\nSharePoint doesn't care in which\norder you type the file extensions.\n\n199\n00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:37.140\nThey must each be on\na separate line though so\n\n200\n00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:42.380\nyou might wanna just naturally alphabetize\nit if you have a blocked file type.\n\n201\n00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.090\nFor example,\nmaybe you don't want AVI files.\n\n202\n00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.120\nI'll type in AVI.\n\n203\n00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.980\nAnd I've alphabetized it myself.\n\n204\n00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.790\nShare Point doesn't care\nabout the order but\n\n205\n00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.140\nthey also make no effort to alphabetize.\n\n206\n00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.950\nOkay, and as a disclaimer at the bottom or\n\n207\n00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.679\ncomment that any file name with braces,\nthey're blocked automatically.\n\n208\n00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:06.880\nBraces are typically the key above\nthe square parenthesis usually\n\n209\n00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.510\non the right hand side of your keyboard.\n\n210\n00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:14.290\nAlright so again if we want to\nblock ABI's enterprise wide I\n\n211\n00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:18.090\nhave to type in AVI as a blocked file\nextension for each web app so I hit OK.\n\n212\n00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.550\nAnd web park security is next.\n\n213\n00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.670\nAll right.\nSo,\n\n214\n00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:32.140\nwe introduced functionality in\nSharePoint in a variety of ways.\n\n215\n00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:36.560\nWe talked in other episodes\nabout farm-wide features,\n\n216\n00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:42.900\nweb app wide features, features Web Parts\nis great way to use functionality.\n\n217\n00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:49.280\nSo we have Web Parts for things like\nnews feeds, content rollups, documents,\n\n218\n00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:54.650\nlists, KPIs, video feeds,\n\n219\n00:12:54.650 --> 00:13:00.270\nany data from an external source,\nmaybe a stock ticker for example.\n\n220\n00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.200\nCustomer sentiment rating.\n\n221\n00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.440\nAnything you can imagine\nthat can be done digitally,\n\n222\n00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.542\nwe can present in a SharePoint\ndigital dashboard.\n\n223\n00:13:08.542 --> 00:13:11.503\nAnd we could have security now, so,\n\n224\n00:13:13.685 --> 00:13:18.504\nOne of the neat things about Web Parts\nas well is we can have One web\n\n225\n00:13:18.504 --> 00:13:23.325\npart consuming content from another\nweb part maybe filtering or\n\n226\n00:13:23.325 --> 00:13:28.145\napplying a multiplier like\na currency conversion for example so\n\n227\n00:13:28.145 --> 00:13:34.770\nwe might have a or a realtime markup maybe\nwe don't use the official exchange rate.\n\n228\n00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:40.070\nWe tack on 1.2% extra for\nany foreign currency transaction so\n\n229\n00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.330\nthe point is you can have web\npoint displays about currency and\n\n230\n00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:48.670\nthen a conversion to a different currency\nwith our standard spread attached to it.\n\n231\n00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.970\nNow, do we want to just allow our\n\n232\n00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:56.870\ncontent developer is to create web\nparts and make links between web parts.\n\n233\n00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.990\nOr do we wanna allow users to also\ncreate connections between web parts.\n\n234\n00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:06.200\nThis is one of the considerations on this\npage here, security for web part pages.\n\n235\n00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:13.860\nAnother consideration is, some of you may\nhave used a store like a Windows store,\n\n236\n00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.379\nand now in the Windows 10 era,\nand server 2012 [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n237\n00:14:17.379 --> 00:14:21.640\nlater, We can have Window's Store\napps that Microsoft provides\n\n238\n00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:26.510\nare already vetted just like from\nyour Apple Application store.\n\n239\n00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.840\nWe can also have side loading,\nwhich is maybe\n\n240\n00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:36.080\nLOb business apps available to our users,\nfrom within the Windows Store.\n\n241\n00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.790\nSo those are pre-approved,\nwell in this context\n\n242\n00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:44.160\nThe metaphor is making is there's\nan online web part gallery.\n\n243\n00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.210\nNow, we might not want our users to have\naccess to all of the different web parts\n\n244\n00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:53.260\nthat are available, we might want to make\na restricted set of web parts that we\n\n245\n00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:58.350\nhave approved, to somebody has approved,\nto make available to users.\n\n246\n00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.710\nIn this case we can prevent users from\naccessing the online web part gallery.\n\n247\n00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:12.000\nNow there's another section here for\nscriptable web parts so\n\n248\n00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.890\nshould contributors be able to add or\nedit scriptable web parts.\n\n249\n00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:21.630\nSo we have two concerns here when\nwe're talking about granting and\n\n250\n00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:25.320\nrestricting access to web parts and\nmaking connections between web parts.\n\n251\n00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:30.810\nOne is security for sure, because\nthere may be some rogue software or\n\n252\n00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:36.180\nrogue code in a web part that can maybe\nsteal customer data, for example.\n\n253\n00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.000\nOr it turned into ransomware.\n\n254\n00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.970\nSo that's one consideration.\n\n255\n00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.660\nThe other consideration is performance.\n\n256\n00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.740\nIt may be a safe web part,\nbut it's poorly written.\n\n257\n00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.010\nAnd is wasteful in terms of resources.\n\n258\n00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.500\nThen we get users complaining\nabout slow performance\n\n259\n00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.100\nin other areas of the SharePoint farm.\n\n260\n00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.380\nFor example,\npages used to load within a second.\n\n261\n00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.458\nWhich is typically the amount\nof time people want to wait.\n\n262\n00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:00.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> One second.\n\n263\n00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.820\nMaybe two seconds tops.\n\n264\n00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.160\n>> Maybe.\n>> But maybe now it's slowing down to\n\n265\n00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:03.960\nthree or four seconds.\n\n266\n00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.894\nSo SharePoint does use resources so\n\n267\n00:16:06.894 --> 00:16:11.210\nwe want to Make the most\nefficient use of resources.\n\n268\n00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:15.746\nOne way is to prevent badly written\ncode from over-consuming resources.\n\n269\n00:16:15.746 --> 00:16:20.768\nSo, again, when it comes to web parts,\nwe're concerned about security\n\n270\n00:16:20.768 --> 00:16:25.470\nof our information and identities,\netc., and also performance.\n\n271\n00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.970\nNotice how there's a Restore Defaults\noption which occurs on several\n\n272\n00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:32.080\npages as well.\n\n273\n00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:37.000\nSo, you or another administrator, might\nhave made a change and not documented it.\n\n274\n00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.165\nI know, all of you watching,\nalways document everything.\n\n275\n00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:44.455\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, some of you do some of the time.\n\n276\n00:16:44.455 --> 00:16:45.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> At least.\n\n277\n00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.050\nOkay, so you might have forgot.\n\n278\n00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:50.460\nMaybe you're the only farm admin and\nyou forgot what change you made.\n\n279\n00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.450\nYou wanna restore defaults or\nget back to your default settings.\n\n280\n00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.510\nAnd by clicking on the Restore Defaults\noption, which is available, again,\n\n281\n00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.800\non some Settings pages, not all.\n\n282\n00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:05.000\nIt helps to get back to the state you\nwere in at the time of farm deployment.\n\n283\n00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.110\n>> I really like it when they give us\nthose kind of options cuz like in a test\n\n284\n00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:10.223\nenvironment when you're\ntesting things out,\n\n285\n00:17:10.223 --> 00:17:12.409\nyou might be playing with\nall kinds of features.\n\n286\n00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:15.215\nAnd you get to a point where you forget\nwhat you've done and you've done so\n\n287\n00:17:15.215 --> 00:17:17.900\nmany things you wanna kind of start\nover and test it in a different way.\n\n288\n00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.260\nMaybe it didn't work out.\n\n289\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.790\nEasier to restore the defaults, or as you\nsaid another admin that maybe didn't know\n\n290\n00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:26.430\nwhat they were doing or were not\nreal careful, goofed something up.\n\n291\n00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:29.380\nUnfortunately I have no record of how\nit was set before when it was working.\n\n292\n00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.780\nRestore defaults, although it\ndoes take you all the way back.\n\n293\n00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.640\nIt doesn't take you back to what you\nhad before somebody goofed up, right?\n\n294\n00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.310\nIt takes you back to\nthe SharePoint defaults.\n\n295\n00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.120\n>> That's a good point.\n\n296\n00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.080\n>> Which is better than being broken.\n\n297\n00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.760\n>> True, true, and\nthis is where snapshots come in,\n\n298\n00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.460\nor now they call them checkpoints.\n\n299\n00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.540\nSo Microsoft syncs up with\nthe VMware terminology, checkpoint,\n\n300\n00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.860\nsnapshot is the same thing.\n\n301\n00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:54.610\nSo, now, you might have some issues\nin a multiserver environment taking\n\n302\n00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:55.980\nsnapshots that are robust.\n\n303\n00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.490\nBut that's why,\nespecially in a test environment,\n\n304\n00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:01.770\nnot such a bad idea to do\nwhat we're doing here today,\n\n305\n00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:06.530\nwhich is we've installed all components\nof SharePoint on a single machine.\n\n306\n00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:09.340\nNow, again,\nthis we never do this in production.\n\n307\n00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.416\nBut for a test environment\nit does make it easy and\n\n308\n00:18:12.416 --> 00:18:17.070\nconsistent then to roll back to previous\nsnapshot without worrying about\n\n309\n00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:22.037\nconsistency issues between DC one or\nmore SharePoint servers or SQL backend.\n\n310\n00:18:22.037 --> 00:18:25.820\nBecause those multi server\nenvironments sometimes snapshots or\n\n311\n00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.465\ncheckpoints don't work the way you expect.\n\n312\n00:18:28.465 --> 00:18:29.450\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n313\n00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.530\n>> And you might roll back to a previous\nsnapshot and end up with an inconsistent\n\n314\n00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:37.260\nenvironment, and\nsometimes you have to start from scratch.\n\n315\n00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.980\nSo let's move onto the next section,\nwhich is or the next part of the general\n\n316\n00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.431\nsecurity section,\nConfigure self-service site creation.\n\n317\n00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.270\nAgain, this is a per web app setting.\n\n318\n00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:53.062\nSo good, before you click anything in\nthe SharePoint Central admin interface, or\n\n319\n00:18:53.062 --> 00:18:57.786\neven a site collection or a site settings\ninterface, look around a bit, make sure\n\n320\n00:18:57.786 --> 00:19:02.750\nyou know where the settings change you're\nabout to make, where it will impact.\n\n321\n00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.882\nIs it web app level,\nsite collections, site?\n\n322\n00:19:05.882 --> 00:19:11.290\nSo make sure you're making the change\nat the level you think you are.\n\n323\n00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.580\nSometimes these links are useful.\n\n324\n00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.190\nSometimes they lead nowhere.\n\n325\n00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.770\nI'm talking about the help\nlinks on SharePoint.\n\n326\n00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:22.640\nBut you'd think it was\ntechnical preview one or\n\n327\n00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.820\nat least candidate two or something,\nbut no this is RCM bits we're using.\n\n328\n00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.485\nAnd drum roll please,\nlet's see if this link works.\n\n329\n00:19:29.485 --> 00:19:36.840\n>> [SOUND]\n>> Amazing it works!\n\n330\n00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.496\nBut it refers to a previous\nversion of the product.\n\n331\n00:19:39.496 --> 00:19:41.044\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, but then again,\n\n332\n00:19:41.044 --> 00:19:46.238\nif you see 2013 info, don't think,\ndon't discard it out of hand as old.\n\n333\n00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:51.086\nBecause almost all of Microsoft's\ninvestment in new technology when it\n\n334\n00:19:51.086 --> 00:19:54.583\ncomes to SharePoint has\nbeen in SharePoint online,\n\n335\n00:19:54.583 --> 00:19:58.910\nOffice 365 integration not so\nmuch the on premises version.\n\n336\n00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.984\nSo that's why if you're familiar\nwith SharePoint 2013 on prem,\n\n337\n00:20:02.984 --> 00:20:05.962\n2016 on prem is going to\nbe fairly easy for you.\n\n338\n00:20:05.962 --> 00:20:09.040\nThere won't be anything shocking for\nyou in your learning journey.\n\n339\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.020\nIf you're new to product well\nthat's all on you anyway.\n\n340\n00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:15.440\nSo don't be dissuaded if\nyou get a link like this.\n\n341\n00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.480\nIt goes to info about 2013,\n\n342\n00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:22.330\nbecause it's highly likely that\nstill applies to your on-prem 2016.\n\n343\n00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:27.557\nSometimes you can click on the other\nversions link when you're on Technet,\n\n344\n00:20:27.557 --> 00:20:32.459\nand you can get the same information\npertaining to previous versions of\n\n345\n00:20:32.459 --> 00:20:33.890\nthe product.\n\n346\n00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:38.210\nIf there is a parallel in the previous\nversion, there might be a new feature,\n\n347\n00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.650\nfor example, that only just came\nout with that version of product.\n\n348\n00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.210\nIn which case, there is no backwards\ncompatibility type information.\n\n349\n00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.935\nAnother thing I learned recently\nyou may not know about,\n\n350\n00:20:46.935 --> 00:20:48.932\nI'm not sure if it existed before or not.\n\n351\n00:20:48.932 --> 00:20:53.502\nBut this, so often we can get bogged\nin tech articles that link and link and\n\n352\n00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:56.020\nlink and we forget where we were.\n\n353\n00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.320\nIt'd be nice to have a repository.\n\n354\n00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.570\nWell, here's something you can do.\n\n355\n00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.320\nThis is not a SharePoint specific tip.\n\n356\n00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.100\nThis is a TechNet tip you can use for\nany technology.\n\n357\n00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.960\nSo you see up in the right here, there's\nan Export button and a Print button.\n\n358\n00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.860\nSo, Print will format the page so\nit comes out better in print.\n\n359\n00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:17.670\nExport, you can collect one or more pages\ntogether in one collection, if you like.\n\n360\n00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.420\nAnd save them as a single file.\n\n361\n00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:24.130\nAnd then if you're offline, whatever pages\nthat you've saved in this collection.\n\n362\n00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.470\nCollection might now be the right term,\nI can remember what the exact term is.\n\n363\n00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:27.750\nBut that's the idea.\n\n364\n00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:32.100\nThen the links work,\neven in offline state.\n\n365\n00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.020\nYou've got a file, a single file,\n\n366\n00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.470\nincluding all the pages that you\nincluded as part of your collection.\n\n367\n00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.750\nSo, that might be something to consider.\n\n368\n00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.922\nSometimes, there's too\nmany pages to print, but\n\n369\n00:21:42.922 --> 00:21:47.741\nthen you don't want 18 tabs open either,\nso this is a nice, happy medium.\n\n370\n00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:49.727\n>> Been there, done that.\n>> We've all done that.\n\n371\n00:21:49.727 --> 00:21:54.120\nOkay, amazingly the link did work.\n\n372\n00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.090\nOften they don't.\n\n373\n00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.387\nI don't know why.\n\n374\n00:21:56.387 --> 00:22:00.150\nAll right, so\nSelf-service Site Collection Management.\n\n375\n00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:06.110\nOkay, SharePoint you could think\nof as we as farm admins, and\n\n376\n00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.010\ncertainly the business decision makers and\ngovernance types,\n\n377\n00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:12.960\nwould decide we're setting up guard rails,\nlike on the highway.\n\n378\n00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.650\nThen again that example may not be apt.\n\n379\n00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:18.990\nJust went for lunch at a barbecue\njoint and a truck somehow went over.\n\n380\n00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.920\nI mean it looked like everyone was okay,\nbut it went over through the guard rail.\n\n381\n00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.500\nI thought guard rails were\nsupposed to keep you on the road.\n\n382\n00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.410\nIt was a very odd scenario, but\n\n383\n00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:32.010\nanyway think of cars and guard rails\ngenerally they stay within the lines.\n\n384\n00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:35.159\nYou can drift a little bit, but then\nyou're over those little Braille things on\n\n385\n00:22:35.159 --> 00:22:36.674\nthe side that wake you up if you go off.\n\n386\n00:22:36.674 --> 00:22:38.686\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that's what we do,\n\n387\n00:22:38.686 --> 00:22:42.850\nwe provide the sort of the extremes\nof what people can do.\n\n388\n00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.990\nBut there's also a sandbox\nelement to SharePoint,\n\n389\n00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.550\nand we talked about this\nin another episode.\n\n390\n00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.910\nYou have to give users the ability\nto play around a bit and experiment.\n\n391\n00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:53.750\nIf you need a totally locked down solution\nwhere no user gets access to anything.\n\n392\n00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:57.520\nAnd they have to fill out four pages\nin triplicate to request some button or\n\n393\n00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.370\nsome menu item be added.\n\n394\n00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:01.320\nSharePoint is probably\nnot a technology for you.\n\n395\n00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:09.180\nSo of course there is ranges of freedom\nversus control as well in any environment.\n\n396\n00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.300\nOne of the ways we can allow or\n\n397\n00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.240\nprevent freedom is should users\nget to create their own sites?\n\n398\n00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:15.985\nYes or no?\n\n399\n00:23:15.985 --> 00:23:19.510\nSo that's what we're talking about with\nSelf-service Site Collection Management.\n\n400\n00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.340\nOr site collections I should say.\n\n401\n00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.500\nAnother thing to keep in mind with\nSharePoint, which could be confusing for\n\n402\n00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.620\nsomeone new to product\nIn the interface itself,\n\n403\n00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:34.665\noften the words site and\nsite collection are used interchangeably.\n\n404\n00:23:34.665 --> 00:23:36.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That could be confusing.\n\n405\n00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:41.150\nSo I'll just, to recap,\nwe've got farm level,\n\n406\n00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:45.680\nweb app, site collection and site.\n\n407\n00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.130\nSo site collection hosts one or\nmore sites.\n\n408\n00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.710\nA site can only be part\nof one site collection.\n\n409\n00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:53.920\nBut again,\nyou might find the words site and\n\n410\n00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.110\nsite collection used\ninterchangeably in the interface.\n\n411\n00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.234\nI don't write the software.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n412\n00:24:00.234 --> 00:24:01.388\n>> So we're saying,\n\n413\n00:24:01.388 --> 00:24:05.221\nyes, users can create their own\nsite collections by default.\n\n414\n00:24:05.221 --> 00:24:07.920\nNow, we can have quota templates.\n\n415\n00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:12.412\nFor the same reason you want quotas\non your file storage usage or\n\n416\n00:24:12.412 --> 00:24:14.120\nexchange for example.\n\n417\n00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.480\nYou may or\nmay not actually enforce the quota, but\n\n418\n00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.250\nyou at least wanna know\nwho's using how much.\n\n419\n00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.960\nOr generating reports like the top\nten users of storage space for\n\n420\n00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.550\nexample, very useful.\n\n421\n00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.980\nSo you could use a quota template.\n\n422\n00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:33.500\nTo restrict, say, site collections\nto 250 megabytes of storage.\n\n423\n00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.890\nAnd then if there's exceptions,\nmaybe they can make a request for\n\n424\n00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:40.240\nan exception,\nmaybe you disable the quota on their site.\n\n425\n00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.930\nBut you wanna have some restrictions or\nelse people might start uploading\n\n426\n00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:49.490\nall kinds of inappropriate content or\nmovies that have copyright restrictions.\n\n427\n00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:54.340\nSo I just showed you how to set up\na blocked file type to that AVI file so\n\n428\n00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:56.530\nquotas are a good idea.\n\n429\n00:24:56.530 --> 00:25:00.390\nEven if they're a high quota you\ndon't want runaway storage growth.\n\n430\n00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.470\nAlso it helps, we've talked about in\nanother episode the importance of\n\n431\n00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.530\npruning or eliminating old data.\n\n432\n00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:12.888\nJust to make the data that is current and\nusable easier to find,\n\n433\n00:25:12.888 --> 00:25:16.810\nwe can de-clutter to make\nthe valuable content easier to find.\n\n434\n00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:19.710\nDo we need old product catalogues\nwith pricing that no longer applies?\n\n435\n00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:24.340\nNo, that's just gonna be confusing for\ninternal or external users.\n\n436\n00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.459\nSo I do recommend quotas.\n\n437\n00:25:29.179 --> 00:25:36.640\nAll right, and then, let's see,\nyou could also have a link.\n\n438\n00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.487\nSo users can create team sites\nat certain locations, and\n\n439\n00:25:40.487 --> 00:25:42.900\nthat's called a start a site link.\n\n440\n00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.570\nThat's something new so you may wanna\nhide that which is the default.\n\n441\n00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:51.460\nOr give users a path under which\nthey can create a team site.\n\n442\n00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:56.000\nSo, you can see here under this radio\nprompts users to create a team site under.\n\n443\n00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.180\nWe've already got the http:// and\nour server name, which is svor1,\n\n444\n00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.730\nand then a forward slash.\n\n445\n00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:08.480\nAnd then we could also\nuse a wild card here.\n\n446\n00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.600\nSo you can see in the text,\nuse user ID or present user ID percent.\n\n447\n00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.300\nThat way the user name\nwho created the site,\n\n448\n00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.840\nthat name would be\nrepresented in the URL path.\n\n449\n00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.189\nSo it makes really\nobvious whose site it is.\n\n450\n00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:27.320\nYou can also allow users to create\nsite collections under manage paths.\n\n451\n00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.920\nWe'll talk about manage\npaths later in the week.\n\n452\n00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.790\nAnd site classification.\n\n453\n00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:37.400\nSo search is a big part of SharePoint and\nwhy users would use,\n\n454\n00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:42.920\nwhy users would love to use SharePoint\nis they can search any kind of content,\n\n455\n00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.070\nif we set up our search\nenvironment correctly.\n\n456\n00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.390\nThey can search any kind of\ncontent from one interface.\n\n457\n00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:51.910\nAs opposed to nowadays, they may\nbe searching, finding, navigating,\n\n458\n00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:57.110\na whole variety of file servers,\ncustom databases, line of business apps.\n\n459\n00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.400\nWouldn't it be great to\nsearch from one place,\n\n460\n00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:05.660\nand get all the results from any\na content source, we can do that.\n\n461\n00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:11.120\nSo one of the ways to make content easier\nto find, is to require users to classify\n\n462\n00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:16.140\nsites, so then this could be an optional\nclassification or a mandatory one.\n\n463\n00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.610\nSo they might have to classify\nby division, for example, or\n\n464\n00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:25.135\ngeographic region or\nsome kind of customer classification.\n\n465\n00:27:25.135 --> 00:27:31.130\nIt's really up to your imagination\nhow you want to classify sites.\n\n466\n00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:34.500\nAnother reason why we classify,\nthey can be part of a search scope.\n\n467\n00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.100\nSo a search scope is if you think of a pie\nas all the information that could be\n\n468\n00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:43.120\nsearched search scope means the user\nchoses the subset of that pie to search.\n\n469\n00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:47.370\nFor example based on content\ntype of based on geography or\n\n470\n00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:50.070\ndivision or country for example.\n\n471\n00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:54.100\nSo by classifying sites maybe\nsomeone does a search on just\n\n472\n00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.510\na particular classification of sites.\n\n473\n00:27:56.510 --> 00:28:02.010\nLike automobile manufacturers for example\nas supposed to all the other customers.\n\n474\n00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:06.210\nIf we're BASF for example, huge firm all\nkinds of customers, all kinds of different\n\n475\n00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.450\nindustries, maybe someone knows\nthat what they're looking for\n\n476\n00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:14.830\nresides in information pertaining to one\nindustry only, or one customer type.\n\n477\n00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.350\nSo you can search a subset of the whole.\n\n478\n00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.940\nAll right, and then this is useful.\n\n479\n00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.690\nThe bottom here,\nremember these are overall settings.\n\n480\n00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:26.220\nAnd this is the last thing we'll\ntalk about for this episode.\n\n481\n00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.320\nAnd that is,\ndo we wanna require a secondary contact?\n\n482\n00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:33.900\nSo every site collection that gets created\nhas a site collection administrator.\n\n483\n00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.820\nOptionally you can have\na secondary contact.\n\n484\n00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:40.640\nSo let's say the primary site collection\nadministrator is out on pat leave,\n\n485\n00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.260\nunavailable for four months,\nbut emails are still coming in.\n\n486\n00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.030\nAnd so someone should be able to respond.\n\n487\n00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:51.260\nWell, if we specify that\na secondary contact is required.\n\n488\n00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:56.690\nThat means both the primary and secondary\nadministrator will get notification\n\n489\n00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:03.130\nof things like requests to join the site\nfor example, so permissions request.\n\n490\n00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:06.910\nSo that's a good idea that\nyou might wanna consider.\n\n491\n00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.410\n>> All right Fantastic, Mark.\n\n492\n00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:10.320\nAgain, a lot of great information there,\nand\n\n493\n00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.540\nI think we've still got some\nmore configurations to go over?\n\n494\n00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:13.390\n>> We're all day long.\n\n495\n00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:16.960\n>> All day long, so\nwe've got more farm configurations.\n\n496\n00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.810\nRemember, SharePoint is 2016,\nwe're talking about the entire farm.\n\n497\n00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:23.350\nSo a lot of different settings\nthat we need to configure\n\n498\n00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:25.475\nto make sure that everything is\ndoing what we want it to do.\n\n499\n00:29:25.475 --> 00:29:28.700\nSo I appreciate that Mark,\nhope everybody out there enjoyed it.\n\n500\n00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.360\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n501\n00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:31.920\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n502\n00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.327\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n503\n00:29:34.327 --> 00:29:35.710\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:20.510\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing our SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.070\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.210\nwe're continuing on with\nconfiguring our farm settings.\n\n6\n00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.770\nSo, we already know why\nwe need to do this.\n\n7\n00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.130\nSo, without further ado,\nwe'll just jump right back in, and\n\n8\n00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.400\nI'll turn it over to Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n9\n00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.290\nHow's it going, Mark?\n\n10\n00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.480\n>> Great, thanks Mike, right on.\n\n11\n00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.900\nSo, when last we spoke,\nor a recent episode,\n\n12\n00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.640\nwe looked into security settings or\nforeign configuration settings.\n\n13\n00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.730\nLet's go into information policy, so\nIRM, Information Rights Management.\n\n14\n00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.100\nAll right, so,\nthis is a whole other topic in itself.\n\n15\n00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.370\nRights management services.\n\n16\n00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.650\nSo we'd have to set up a rights\nmanagement services infrastructure first,\n\n17\n00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.900\nan active directory to take advantage\nof information rights management.\n\n18\n00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.390\nYou're looking at a half-day setup for\nthat.\n\n19\n00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.670\nSo what is rights management?\n\n20\n00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.330\nBriefly, it's a way to add\nan additional layer of security\n\n21\n00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.920\nover your Office documents.\n\n22\n00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.790\nSo, it doesn't negate or replace\nanything you are currently doing, but\n\n23\n00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.150\nit can allow us,\nif I have authoring capabilities\n\n24\n00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.770\nwithin an IRM infrastructure, I can apply\nadditional restrictions to the document.\n\n25\n00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.280\nFor example, do not print that one's\na little bogus because if I have read\n\n26\n00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.990\npermission to the document,\neven if you've set up do not print on it,\n\n27\n00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.750\nI can still take\na photograph of the screen.\n\n28\n00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.670\nBut I cannot use Print Screen.\n\n29\n00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.490\nSo, it makes it a little more difficult\nfor someone to print the contents.\n\n30\n00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.200\nDo not forward is more robust.\n\n31\n00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.870\nThat means, let's say I try and forward\nan attachment outside our firewall,\n\n32\n00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.330\nto a competitor maybe or inadvertently\nsent to a customer, some product\n\n33\n00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.110\nlist that should only remain inside\nthe firewall or should not be forwarded.\n\n34\n00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.460\nThen it will be prevented from being sent.\n\n35\n00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.750\nSo that Do Not Forward\ncapability is useful.\n\n36\n00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.110\nI can also expire content.\n\n37\n00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.720\nSo let's say I'm bidding on\na contract to replace a bridge.\n\n38\n00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.480\nThe bid close date happens and\nthen I can say okay,\n\n39\n00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.060\nthree months after that,\nexpire the content.\n\n40\n00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.600\nIn other words,\nit won't be legible after that time.\n\n41\n00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.030\nSo that's some rights\nmanagement we can apply.\n\n42\n00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.980\nSo I could utilize that in the SharePoint\ncontext if I've already set up a rates\n\n43\n00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.380\nmanagement server infrastructure.\n\n44\n00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.840\n>> You do need Active Directory Rights\nManagement server running outside of\n\n45\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.830\nSharePoint to be able to\nuse that within SharePoint.\n\n46\n00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.360\n>> Exactly.\n\n47\n00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.090\n>> Okay.\n\n48\n00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.800\n>> Exactly\n>> And if I click on a configure\n\n49\n00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.260\ninformation management policy this is\nthis relates to what I do with data.\n\n50\n00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.160\nWe've been preaching the value\nof discarding unneeded data\n\n51\n00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.900\nto make it easier to find relevant\ncurrent data for example,\n\n52\n00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.440\nhere is some additional things\nI can do with my documentation.\n\n53\n00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.970\nI can apply Auditing.\n\n54\n00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.790\nI can have a retention policy established.\n\n55\n00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.210\nRetention policy can be based\non anything you can dream up.\n\n56\n00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.800\nAnd you can even incorporate\nretention as part of a work flow.\n\n57\n00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.330\nFor example, you might say, okay if a\ndocument has not been accessed by anybody\n\n58\n00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.400\nfor one year,\nthen notify the document creator.\n\n59\n00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.629\nOr maybe the document creator's manager.\n\n60\n00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.910\nAnd then at that point the manager can\ndecide what to do with the document.\n\n61\n00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.310\n>> Nice.\n>> Or you can say\n\n62\n00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.210\nif a document has not been accessed\nin say, two years, then archive it.\n\n63\n00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.740\nSo, it's still accessible but\nit's not online, it might be near line.\n\n64\n00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:46.090\nBar code so you can tag documents\nwith bar codes, and labels as well.\n\n65\n00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.000\nSo let's say I want to print a document.\n\n66\n00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.670\nIf it's got labeling attached to that\nthat means information gets printed\n\n67\n00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.290\non the cover page of the document.\n\n68\n00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.460\nIt also can form part of a search for\nthe document.\n\n69\n00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.320\nSo again we can use information management\npolicies as part of a work flow\n\n70\n00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.510\nif we choose.\n\n71\n00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.100\nSo that's a security section.\n\n72\n00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.430\nNow one thing a couple\nof sometimes let's say\n\n73\n00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.330\nI click on a link that last one there the\nsecond last I might click on that link.\n\n74\n00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.940\nThe title of that page that opens up,\n\n75\n00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.540\nmost people would expect to have\nthe same name as that link, but\n\n76\n00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.210\nno sometimes those names don't exactly\nmatch up that could be a little confusing.\n\n77\n00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.020\nAnother thing which is odd and\n\n78\n00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.240\nwe experienced it at the end\nof the last episode.\n\n79\n00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.400\nLet's say I click on a link and then I\ngo back, or hit Cancel, or OK, or I'm\n\n80\n00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.830\nfinished with that page, one would expect\nto go back to the exact same place I was\n\n81\n00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.840\nbefore, the page I was on before I clicked\nthe link., to get to the other page.\n\n82\n00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.095\nNo, often sometimes it can have you\nbounce to a complete different page.\n\n83\n00:04:50.095 --> 00:04:52.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Somewhere else in the farm\n\n84\n00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.040\nadministration settings.\n\n85\n00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.830\nNow that you've heard this you\nmight not have experienced it\n\n86\n00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.190\nwhen it does happen to you,\nyou'll say yeah.\n\n87\n00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.630\n>> Nice. [LAUGH] >> I remember that now.\n\n88\n00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.035\nI don't cone the product.\n\n89\n00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:04.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Microsoft trying to keep us\n\n90\n00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.530\non our toes.\n\n91\n00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.330\nMake sure you're paying attention.\n\n92\n00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.950\n>> That's [INAUDIBLE] It's working.\n\n93\n00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:08.847\n[LAUGH] It's working.\n\n94\n00:05:08.847 --> 00:05:14.770\n>> [LAUGH] All right, let's look at\nBackup and Restore, always important.\n\n95\n00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.280\nNow, you may wanna use third-party tools,\nthat's totally okay.\n\n96\n00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.930\nLet's look at what's\nbaked into the product.\n\n97\n00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.390\nI click on Perform a Backup.\n\n98\n00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.160\nAnd wait for it to load.\n\n99\n00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.390\nSee what comes up here.\n\n100\n00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.450\n>> It's thinking about it.\n\n101\n00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.650\n>> All right.\n\n102\n00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.870\nSo we have a lot of granularity when\nit comes to choosing what to back up.\n\n103\n00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.490\nNow at this point we can see or\nhave a lost now.\n\n104\n00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.170\nA concept.\n\n105\n00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.460\nSo it gives us some headlines here,\nsome information.\n\n106\n00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.600\nNo backup or restore in progress.\n\n107\n00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.740\nI can click this link to find out the\nstatus of a current backup or restore job.\n\n108\n00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.920\nThe Timer service is running,\nthat's excellent.\n\n109\n00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.810\nWe looked at in another episode,\n\n110\n00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.740\nthe importance of various Timer jobs to\nperform routine activities in SharePoint.\n\n111\n00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.010\nThe Administration Service is running,\nthat's excellent.\n\n112\n00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.320\nNow, here's the granularity\nI was talking about.\n\n113\n00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.380\nI could backup the entire farm, and\n\n114\n00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.170\nnotice how that we have\na nice blue shaded area now.\n\n115\n00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.810\nSteely blue.\n\n116\n00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.580\nNow maybe I don't wanna backup the farm,\n\n117\n00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.480\nmaybe I'm just interested\nin some subset of the farm.\n\n118\n00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.830\nFor example.\n\n119\n00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.680\nInfopath forum services.\n\n120\n00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.700\nSo notice now I select that checkbox.\n\n121\n00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.680\nAnything related that needs to be backed\nup along with what I originally selected,\n\n122\n00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.900\nautomatically gets selected.\n\n123\n00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.410\nSo I don't need to worry\nabout accidentally\n\n124\n00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.690\nforgetting to select one checkbox.\n\n125\n00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.570\nIt can save me from myself, as it were.\n\n126\n00:06:45.055 --> 00:06:50.560\nOkay, so that's how you select a component\nof the to back up, some kind of subset.\n\n127\n00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.285\nI won't actually do the backup\nnow; it's supposed to be a tour.\n\n128\n00:06:54.285 --> 00:06:55.895\n[LAUGH] It's a long tour!\n\n129\n00:06:55.895 --> 00:06:57.905\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Charging by the hour.\n\n130\n00:06:57.905 --> 00:06:59.300\n>> [LAUGH] A tour of the city.\n\n131\n00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.430\nRestore from backup is\nthe opposite of backup, of course.\n\n132\n00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.620\nI'd have to first navigate\nto file share path\n\n133\n00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.430\nwhere the backup was located, and\n\n134\n00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.910\nthen I would have the option of restoring\nall the content that backed up or\n\n135\n00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.120\nsome subset and to the original\nlocation or a different location.\n\n136\n00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.300\nBackup settings, let's check those out.\n\n137\n00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.900\nOkay, so, remember, a lot of activity\nin a SharePoint environment,\n\n138\n00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.070\neven with the basic deployment.\n\n139\n00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:35.410\nSo, we want to be cognizant of the impact\nof our tasks that are running.\n\n140\n00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.870\nMicrosoft makes it easy to do that.\n\n141\n00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.420\nIn this case, with backup threads.\n\n142\n00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.507\nIn other words,\nprocessor threads in used for\n\n143\n00:07:41.507 --> 00:07:46.254\nour maximum number in use at one time for\nboth backing up and restoring,\n\n144\n00:07:46.254 --> 00:07:49.912\nanywhere from one to ten\nthreads would be the maximum.\n\n145\n00:07:49.912 --> 00:07:52.553\nAnd we could also specify\na backup location there.\n\n146\n00:07:52.553 --> 00:07:58.335\nThere's a link to find out more about\nbackup locations if you're curious.\n\n147\n00:07:58.335 --> 00:08:03.072\nI could look up at the Backup and Restore\nHistory, which there'll be none right now.\n\n148\n00:08:03.072 --> 00:08:06.874\nBut, you can check it out if you are so\ninclined, and\n\n149\n00:08:06.874 --> 00:08:09.720\nthe job status should also be blank.\n\n150\n00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.960\nSometimes when a back up and restore\njob is in process it doesn't refresh,\n\n151\n00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.830\nin which case if you want to see\nthe latest info because you're impatient,\n\n152\n00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:24.040\nlike me, you can click on refresh and\nyou get a more current status on the job.\n\n153\n00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.010\nYou can see x number of files out\nof a total number restoring and\n\n154\n00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.990\nyou can get at least some idea of\nwhen you'll be back in business.\n\n155\n00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.983\nNow, those are,\neven with farm backup and restore,\n\n156\n00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:40.980\nI showed you how to backup or\nrestore a subset of total farm data.\n\n157\n00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.560\nWell, let's go into\nthe granular backup section.\n\n158\n00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:49.420\nThis is optimized, or arranged for\nif you like backing up a site collection\n\n159\n00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:56.520\nand again we're not going to actually set\none up there but that's where you'd go.\n\n160\n00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.220\nI could also export a site or list.\n\n161\n00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.880\nAnd, for example, I would specify a site\ncollection, a site, a particular list.\n\n162\n00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.920\nNow it's said that everything\nin SharePoint is a website.\n\n163\n00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.600\nAnother thing that's often bandied about,\nor\n\n164\n00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.369\nsaid is that everything\nin SharePoint is a list.\n\n165\n00:09:14.369 --> 00:09:17.700\nSo, it's usually either a list or a site.\n\n166\n00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.750\nSo, even a document library, for\n\n167\n00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:23.740\nexample, library sounds fancy,\nbut really it's just a list.\n\n168\n00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:29.220\nIt's a list of documents or an InfoPath\nforms library it's simply a list of forms.\n\n169\n00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:34.220\nSo, let's says I want to export a list for\nsome reason, I can do that by specifying\n\n170\n00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:40.660\nin which site the list lives and\nhigher up in site is site collection.\n\n171\n00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.490\nAnd then,\n\n172\n00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:47.730\ndo I want to include the existing security\non the list when I export the list?\n\n173\n00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.230\nOr do I not care about security\n\n174\n00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.580\non that list which I'm\nexporting on the other side?\n\n175\n00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.270\nSo, I have an option there.\n\n176\n00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.790\nAnd then, now, versions this is\nan interesting topic here, and\n\n177\n00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.620\nwhat the heck,\nI might as well talk about it.\n\n178\n00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.850\nSo, one of the neat things about\nSharePoint is the ability to retain\n\n179\n00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.880\nversions of information.\n\n180\n00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.060\nSo, that if someone accidentally deletes\nthe page of a document, especially if\n\n181\n00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.550\nmultiple people are collaborating, someone\nmight inadvertently fat finger something,\n\n182\n00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.110\nand whoops, I just deleted a page or\na certain chart which we really needed.\n\n183\n00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.972\nOr, we thought we didn't\nneed it back in version one.\n\n184\n00:10:17.972 --> 00:10:21.750\nWe've saved version two, version three,\nthen we realize we really do need that.\n\n185\n00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.040\nSo, let's go back to version one.\n\n186\n00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.610\nSo, you can save a defined number,\nyou define the number,\n\n187\n00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:34.430\nof major versions of documents and\nalso draft, or minor versions.\n\n188\n00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:38.590\nSo, let's say a few of us\nare collaborating, let's say it's msn.com.\n\n189\n00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:42.530\nThe bigger the audience is the more likely\nyou are to have multiple stages involved\n\n190\n00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.710\nin the process of creating and\napproving content.\n\n191\n00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:49.380\nSo, let's say we're collaborating on\na draft document, it's not ready for\n\n192\n00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.840\nprime time, the public should not see it.\n\n193\n00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.770\nEventually, we edit it,\nit's been approved, and it gets published.\n\n194\n00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.340\nThat would be version number one.\n\n195\n00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.960\nAnd then, maybe there's some\nmore edits updates to the story,\n\n196\n00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.920\nso draft version 1.1 draft version 1.2,\nwhich generally or this\n\n197\n00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.220\ndefault is only people involved in editing\nor approving can see draft versions.\n\n198\n00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.790\nWhen it's time to approve that\nversion it becomes version 2.0 so\n\n199\n00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.130\nthe published versions are always\na whole number integer.\n\n200\n00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:20.450\nSo, when it comes to in this\nspecific case of exporting a list,\n\n201\n00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.130\ndo I want to include\nthe versions with the list?\n\n202\n00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.320\nVarious choices there.\n\n203\n00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.600\nOr, just the current or latest version?\n\n204\n00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.770\nSo, that's that, and\nthere's a good example of,\n\n205\n00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.798\nI hit Cancel and\nwent back to a different screen.\n\n206\n00:11:36.798 --> 00:11:37.803\n>> Interesting.\n\n207\n00:11:37.803 --> 00:11:39.440\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n208\n00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.310\nDon't try this at home.\n\n209\n00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.410\nAll right.\n\n210\n00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.970\nUnattach client database that's beyond\nthe scope, so is that other option there.\n\n211\n00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.150\nSo, that's backup and restore.\n\n212\n00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.940\nWe have upgrade and\nmigration options at the farm level.\n\n213\n00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.480\nSo, confirm farm license type,\n\n214\n00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.840\nthat simply means you're going from\nmaybe a trial to a full version,\n\n215\n00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.900\nor from standard, SharePoint Standard\nEdition to Enterprise Edition.\n\n216\n00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.000\nAnd, you simply enter the product key,\nand voila.\n\n217\n00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.480\nThe Enterprise functionality, which\nwas hidden for you, from you, rather,\n\n218\n00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:14.640\nif you were using Standard Edition, now\nthe Enterprise functionality is revealed\n\n219\n00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.800\nbased on you entering a valid key.\n\n220\n00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.650\nSo, that's converting the license type.\n\n221\n00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.593\nAnd, enable enterprise features.\n\n222\n00:12:26.252 --> 00:12:29.249\nOkay, so, let's say you fork out for\n\n223\n00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:35.520\nthe enterprise license over the standard\nlicense, you're paying more.\n\n224\n00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.450\nBut, you're not quite ready to\nenable those enterprise features.\n\n225\n00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.470\nYou can choose when to\nenable those features.\n\n226\n00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.100\nSo, if I had a standard edition,\nit would say standard.\n\n227\n00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:50.920\nIf I enter the enterprise key,\nthen enterprise radio button option.\n\n228\n00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.720\nBut again, just because we have\nthe capability to make available features,\n\n229\n00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.216\nEnterprise level features,\nmaybe we're not ready for it yet.\n\n230\n00:12:58.216 --> 00:12:59.880\nMaybe we want to look at okay,\n\n231\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.370\nwhich Enterprise features do we actually\nwant to utilize, rather than just making\n\n232\n00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.680\neverything available without realizing\nsome of the consequences of that.\n\n233\n00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.639\nOkay, and\nenable features on existing sites.\n\n234\n00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:19.580\nOkay so, again we can make it available\nfor farm level and then we check\n\n235\n00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.960\nthis check box and then those enterprise\nfeatures will be available, say to site\n\n236\n00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.950\ncollection administrators to implement in\ntheir site collections if they so choose.\n\n237\n00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:33.220\nProduct and\npatch installation status, okay.\n\n238\n00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:38.790\nIt's very important to keep your versions\nof SharePoint in a multi-machine\n\n239\n00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:43.010\nenvironment making sure you use the exact\nsame version number of SharePoint.\n\n240\n00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:46.100\nNow, there's going to be some lag\ntime because you typically you're\n\n241\n00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:51.300\nnot necessarily passing every SharePoint\nmachine at the exact same time.\n\n242\n00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:56.370\nBut, for example, you might start\nwith the web finance servers, and\n\n243\n00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.700\nmaybe you have three web print out\nservers, you patch one at a time.\n\n244\n00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.490\nAnd then, when you check that\nthey're all three web point end\n\n245\n00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:05.260\nservers are at the same parch level,\nthen you move on to your application tier.\n\n246\n00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.740\nIf you have servers below that level and\n\n247\n00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.350\nthen perhaps your other index server,\nsearch server, etcetera.\n\n248\n00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:17.340\nSo, this is one place to go, the manage\npack status page where you can verify\n\n249\n00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:21.750\nthat you are each server in your\nenvironment's running the same version.\n\n250\n00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:27.090\nNow, this is a little odd because we only\nhave one physical machine right now and\n\n251\n00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:32.910\nit's also got different language\nversions reporting here,\n\n252\n00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:34.690\nwhich is a bit odd frankly.\n\n253\n00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.782\nBut, this screen would make more sense\nif we had multiple servers in our\n\n254\n00:14:37.782 --> 00:14:40.730\nenvironment, or it would be more\nuseful to refer to I should say.\n\n255\n00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:45.950\nSo again, we could verify that eventually,\nsooner rather than later,\n\n256\n00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:51.002\nif we make a patch to one web front m\nmachine then we patch all the way up front\n\n257\n00:14:51.002 --> 00:14:55.900\nm machines to the same patch level,\nin this case 16.0.4351.1000.\n\n258\n00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.190\nAnd then, work on an application\ntier if we have any.\n\n259\n00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.940\nAnd then, our search servers,\nindex servers,\n\n260\n00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.700\nany specialized roles on\nany different hardware.\n\n261\n00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.645\nWhen I say hardware I mean VMs or\nphysical machines.\n\n262\n00:15:07.645 --> 00:15:09.280\nThat's the patch status.\n\n263\n00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.690\nConsistency is the key.\n\n264\n00:15:11.692 --> 00:15:14.330\n>> Yeah, because really one of those\nupdates could bring in a new feature or\n\n265\n00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.990\nsomething that now one of your\nservers out of the ten understands.\n\n266\n00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.890\n>> Right, exactly, or one of the neat\nthings about client interaction\n\n267\n00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:27.210\nwith web front end servers is let's say\nwe have three web front end servers,\n\n268\n00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:31.425\nas a client there's typically some kind\nof round robin so that the web front end\n\n269\n00:15:31.425 --> 00:15:35.870\nservers know which machine is\nresponding to my client machine.\n\n270\n00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:41.082\nHowever, I could get information to\npopulate my whatever site I'm clicking\n\n271\n00:15:41.082 --> 00:15:45.903\non I can get components of that site\nfrom all three web front end severs.\n\n272\n00:15:46.953 --> 00:15:52.091\n>> Potentially, and depending on what,\nthe actions I'm performing I may have,\n\n273\n00:15:52.091 --> 00:15:56.692\nthere's no not necessarily affinity\nbetween me and the web front end of\n\n274\n00:15:56.692 --> 00:16:01.544\nthe server that takes my connection\nrequest at first or click on a webpage.\n\n275\n00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:05.296\nSo maybe passed around,\nelements may come from more than one.\n\n276\n00:16:05.296 --> 00:16:06.098\nBrev front end server.\n\n277\n00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:10.022\nSo that underscores the importance of\nkeeping the patch levels the same, so\n\n278\n00:16:10.022 --> 00:16:11.751\nthere's consistencies there.\n\n279\n00:16:11.751 --> 00:16:14.380\nNow, Review Database Status\nis another option here.\n\n280\n00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.660\nLet's check that out.\n\n281\n00:16:20.265 --> 00:16:24.289\nOkay, so there are a variety\nof databases installed.\n\n282\n00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:29.894\nNow in a different episode,\nwe looked at content databases,\n\n283\n00:16:29.894 --> 00:16:33.336\nor that was our logical\ndiagramming episode.\n\n284\n00:16:33.336 --> 00:16:36.965\nAnd we talked about site collection\ncontent only being allowed to live in\n\n285\n00:16:36.965 --> 00:16:38.670\na single content database.\n\n286\n00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:42.700\nWe can move an entire site collection's\ncontent to a different content database.\n\n287\n00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.820\nWe can't break up a site\ncollection's content,\n\n288\n00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.150\nin other words, subsites,\ndocument libraries,\n\n289\n00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.200\netc, and spread a site collection\nover more than one content database.\n\n290\n00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.870\nSo we can see a couple of\ncontent databases there.\n\n291\n00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:59.660\nNow, depending on service applications,\nwhich we'll talk about,\n\n292\n00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:05.009\ndepending on which service apps we enable,\nmore databases will be created.\n\n293\n00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.610\nFor example, the user profile\nservice installs multiple databases.\n\n294\n00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:14.820\nHere's one, a search links database,\nsearch gatherer database.\n\n295\n00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:21.080\nSo all kinds of databases here, some\nof which at this point require action.\n\n296\n00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.423\nAnd so this says databases and\ncompatibility range,\n\n297\n00:17:23.423 --> 00:17:25.290\nan upgrade is recommended.\n\n298\n00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.190\nThat's something we'd talk\nabout in an advanced course.\n\n299\n00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:32.110\nBut the point is, I'm just showing you\nthat we have multiple databases in play.\n\n300\n00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.330\nKinda leads me to my recommendation\nthat you have a dedicated SQL box or\n\n301\n00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:41.100\ntwo mirrored for\nyour SharePoint deployment.\n\n302\n00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.550\nIf you have to coexist and have\nan instance running on a SQL box that's\n\n303\n00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.230\nserving another SQL workload, that's okay.\n\n304\n00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:47.970\nIt's just not ideal.\n\n305\n00:17:51.694 --> 00:17:54.701\nAnd check Upgrade Status here.\n\n306\n00:17:54.701 --> 00:17:56.918\nOkay, nothing there.\n\n307\n00:17:56.918 --> 00:18:00.393\nAnd that's something we talk about\nin the advanced course anyway.\n\n308\n00:18:00.393 --> 00:18:02.193\nSo that's upgrade and migration.\n\n309\n00:18:02.193 --> 00:18:07.035\nI think we covered, no we didn't,\nokay so general Application Settings.\n\n310\n00:18:07.035 --> 00:18:09.995\nSo here's our send to connections.\n\n311\n00:18:09.995 --> 00:18:11.830\nThis is kind of neat.\n\n312\n00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:18.770\nSo we can make available when a user\nselects the context menu for a document.\n\n313\n00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:22.000\nSo we don't right-click as a webpage,\nbut we can select,\n\n314\n00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.270\nlet's say there's a link representing\na document name in a document library.\n\n315\n00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:31.780\nIf we click beside that,\nthe whole bar lights up\n\n316\n00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.690\nincluding that link for the document and\nthen we can have a context menu when we\n\n317\n00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:39.840\nclick on that bar, which is like a\nright-click menu but we can't right-click.\n\n318\n00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.380\nOkay so we could populate that\nmenu with an additional item and\n\n319\n00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.480\nthat is a send to item.\n\n320\n00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:52.475\nIn other words, a place where there's\na shortcut that you just can click on,\n\n321\n00:18:52.475 --> 00:18:55.981\nor more than one, and\ndirect that document or\n\n322\n00:18:55.981 --> 00:19:00.523\nmove it to a different place\nin the SharePoint hierarchy.\n\n323\n00:19:00.523 --> 00:19:03.780\nNow, we could also copy.\n\n324\n00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.620\nIn other words, we can duplicate\nthe content with a send to link.\n\n325\n00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.360\nAnother option is move it,\nso like that's cut and\n\n326\n00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:16.340\npaste, or move it and\nleave a link, which is cool.\n\n327\n00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.340\nThat's like,\nif you've had any archive experience,\n\n328\n00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.750\nlet's say with Exchange Mailboxes\nwhere there's just a stub left or\n\n329\n00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:28.060\na shortcut to the email that lives\nsomewhere else in more efficient storage,\n\n330\n00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.390\nthat takes advantage of de-duplicating for\nexample.\n\n331\n00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:34.200\nSo that way you could still see a link to\nthe document in your document library.\n\n332\n00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.772\nIt's just the document now lives somewhere\nelse in your SharePoint environment.\n\n333\n00:19:36.772 --> 00:19:37.689\n>> That's pretty cool.\n\n334\n00:19:37.689 --> 00:19:40.231\n>> Which is cool,\nbecause you still get the benefit\n\n335\n00:19:40.231 --> 00:19:42.843\nof navigating-\n>> It still shows up in the library they\n\n336\n00:19:42.843 --> 00:19:45.921\nexpect to find it in,\neven though it's archived on a server for\n\n337\n00:19:45.921 --> 00:19:48.200\nleast accessed files or\nsomething like that.\n\n338\n00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:56.070\n>> Exactly, so this is kind of neat\nthat you can set up these send to links.\n\n339\n00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:02.767\nSo maybe there's some library you need to\nsend to based on workflow, for example.\n\n340\n00:20:02.767 --> 00:20:05.360\nSo that's the Send To Connections.\n\n341\n00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:10.780\nDocument Conversions is\nanother option here.\n\n342\n00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:15.440\nSo this is a way of converting\ncertain file types into\n\n343\n00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.300\ncontent that can be read on a webpage, for\n\n344\n00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:24.540\nexample, InfoPath forms,\nXML, even Word documents.\n\n345\n00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:29.786\nAnd because I give an example of\na law firm that's 100 years old,\n\n346\n00:20:29.786 --> 00:20:30.870\nthey're gonna have a lot of paper.\n\n347\n00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.990\nLet's say they're in the process\nof digitizing it, so, scanning and\n\n348\n00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:35.340\ndigitizing.\n\n349\n00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:40.079\nWell, converting these\ndocuments to be read in\n\n350\n00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:44.112\nHTML format could take months, right?\n\n351\n00:20:44.112 --> 00:20:45.130\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n352\n00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:49.540\n>> But you can schedule\nactivity to occur in, say,\n\n353\n00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:54.590\n15 minute chunks once a day.\n\n354\n00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:59.170\nOr an hour a day overnight, depending\non your windows for other activities.\n\n355\n00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:03.511\nAnd that way you're not overwhelming your\nSharePoint farm with this one task, but\n\n356\n00:21:03.511 --> 00:21:05.566\nyou're still moving forward with it.\n\n357\n00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:10.253\nI mean if you've had it in paper for\n100 years, you can wait a year maybe, or\n\n358\n00:21:10.253 --> 00:21:14.390\nseveral months for the project to\nbe digitized and readable online.\n\n359\n00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.470\nSo that is\nthe Document Conversion service.\n\n360\n00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:25.016\nThere are applications settings for\nInfoPath forms as well.\n\n361\n00:21:25.016 --> 00:21:27.826\nSo InfoPath, the latest I've heard,\n\n362\n00:21:27.826 --> 00:21:31.925\nthere's no plans to upgrade\nInfoPath beyond 2013.\n\n363\n00:21:31.925 --> 00:21:36.600\nHowever, it will still work, you can still\ncreate InfoPath forms, InfoPath 2013.\n\n364\n00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.140\nThat'll work for this current version\nof SharePoint on-prem 2016 and\n\n365\n00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.170\nfuture versions.\n\n366\n00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:46.306\nSupport has been committed for\nInfoPath, from Microsoft, until 2024.\n\n367\n00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:48.950\nSo here's some variety of forum templates.\n\n368\n00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:52.260\nNow, many customers are gonna want\nto create their own templates.\n\n369\n00:21:54.253 --> 00:21:57.430\nWhat kinds of things would\nthey create templates for?\n\n370\n00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.060\nMike, if I could throw it\nover to you on the spot.\n\n371\n00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.880\nMaybe what have you used internally or\nyour workplace before?\n\n372\n00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.440\n>> We need templates for\nsome of our outlines for\n\n373\n00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.040\nour shows that we send out to our subject\nmatter experts that are coming in.\n\n374\n00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.480\nThat'd be a great template\nthat we could use.\n\n375\n00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.790\n>> Perfect.\n>> Yeah.\n\n376\n00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:18.350\nShow notes we do, anything really I\nguess that you do repetitively, right?\n\n377\n00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:22.470\nLike descriptions for each one of my\nepisodes, they need certain things,\n\n378\n00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:25.360\na title, a date, a shot,\nand things like that.\n\n379\n00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.050\nTemplates make it really easy to get\nconsistent collection of that information.\n\n380\n00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.983\n>> Right, and also ensure that you're\ncapturing all the data you need.\n\n381\n00:22:31.983 --> 00:22:34.270\nSo you could have required form fields.\n\n382\n00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:38.603\nThese form fields once filled out and\nyou've uploaded the form,\n\n383\n00:22:38.603 --> 00:22:44.400\nindividual fields could be sent off or\ninform a part of a work flow, if you will.\n\n384\n00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:49.700\nFor example, managing director, say,\nor I'm just switching gears, for\n\n385\n00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:53.930\nexample, an expense report typically has\nto be signed off by one or more people.\n\n386\n00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:57.482\nWell, as soon as a person submits\na report, maybe there's a form there that\n\n387\n00:22:57.482 --> 00:23:00.814\nautomatically calculates or\nmaybe you've filled out the manager, so\n\n388\n00:23:00.814 --> 00:23:04.774\na copy of that form automatically goes to\nthe manager, for example, for sign offs.\n\n389\n00:23:04.774 --> 00:23:06.927\nSo there's some built-in forms here but\n\n390\n00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:09.950\npeople definitely go to town\non creating their own forms.\n\n391\n00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:14.681\nWhatever you can dream up in terms of\na work flow that happens electronically,\n\n392\n00:23:14.681 --> 00:23:18.481\nas opposed to a paper-based form\nwhich requires re-entry and\n\n393\n00:23:18.481 --> 00:23:20.600\npossible mistakes in re-entry.\n\n394\n00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.900\nGet rid of paper-based\nforms wherever possible.\n\n395\n00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.750\nI realize it's not always\nentirely possible,\n\n396\n00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:29.530\nbut with digital signatures being fully\naccepted now as legal documents or\n\n397\n00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:33.770\nlegal signing, there's really no excuse\nto persist with paper-based forms.\n\n398\n00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:37.631\nSo I won't show you more\nin InfoPath form services,\n\n399\n00:23:37.631 --> 00:23:40.366\nthat is an advanced course subject.\n\n400\n00:23:40.366 --> 00:23:45.432\nNow, SharePoint Designer, this is useful.\n\n401\n00:23:45.432 --> 00:23:49.400\nIf you've used Microsoft FrontPage,\nthat turned into SharePoint Designer.\n\n402\n00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:54.380\nAnd now,\nyou can do a lot of things with it.\n\n403\n00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.010\nSharePoint Designer, which affect\nthe look and feel of your deployments.\n\n404\n00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:05.039\nSo I've preached the gospel of\nvery few farm admins per farm.\n\n405\n00:24:05.039 --> 00:24:08.725\nSimilarly, very few people should\nhave SharePoint Designer access.\n\n406\n00:24:08.725 --> 00:24:10.990\nWhy, cuz they could really\nscrew things up is why.\n\n407\n00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.869\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Do you really want Fred down the hall\n\n408\n00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:18.931\nhaving pink and purple designs or\nlight blue or all black goth design?\n\n409\n00:24:18.931 --> 00:24:21.300\nI mean, it can be ugly.\n\n410\n00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:26.290\nEspecially if you have customer facing\nterminals, and you need to standardize,\n\n411\n00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:31.740\nyou wanna have people that are involved\nin marketing, branding, graphic design,\n\n412\n00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:37.880\nwebsite design, that can use corporate\ncolors and schemes, and images, etc.\n\n413\n00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:43.770\nUnless it's team site and\nthe people don't see the light of day, or\n\n414\n00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:47.900\nthey, at least customers don't see\nthe screens, then the impact of\n\n415\n00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.860\nmaybe someone in their own personal\nsite tweaking around is not so great.\n\n416\n00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:56.100\nCertainly for any customer,\nbank teller terminals, for example, or\n\n417\n00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.950\ntravel agencies, or\nyou wanna standardize, because people can\n\n418\n00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:06.080\ndo a lot of damage with Designer that\nis a major hassle to try and fix.\n\n419\n00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.052\nSo, people that need it, again,\nthe graphic, the branding types,\n\n420\n00:25:11.052 --> 00:25:15.542\ninvolve with the look and feel,\ncolor schemes, fonts, etc.\n\n421\n00:25:15.542 --> 00:25:16.869\nThat's SharePoint Designer.\n\n422\n00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:21.273\nAll right, and let's see.\n\n423\n00:25:22.996 --> 00:25:24.958\nThat's good for\nnow actually, this episode.\n\n424\n00:25:24.958 --> 00:25:27.448\nSo there's certainly more\nI wanna talk about but\n\n425\n00:25:27.448 --> 00:25:29.520\nthat's a natural place to end this one.\n\n426\n00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.028\n>> All right, sounds good Mark.\n\n427\n00:25:31.028 --> 00:25:32.944\nAgain, ton of information, right?\n\n428\n00:25:32.944 --> 00:25:37.934\nYou see how many options there are when it\ncomes to configuring our farm settings,\n\n429\n00:25:37.934 --> 00:25:42.362\nour web application settings,\nour site collection settings and so on.\n\n430\n00:25:42.362 --> 00:25:44.534\nSo thank you for\nthat tour of those settings,\n\n431\n00:25:44.534 --> 00:25:46.776\nI hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n432\n00:25:46.776 --> 00:25:49.296\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n433\n00:25:49.296 --> 00:25:50.259\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n434\n00:25:50.259 --> 00:25:51.501\n>> And we'll see you next

here\nat ITPro.TV, I'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.059\nToday we're doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:23.062\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna continue our look at our\n\n6\n00:00:23.062 --> 00:00:26.488\nconfigurations that we can do\non our SharePoint Server Farm.\n\n7\n00:00:26.488 --> 00:00:29.790\nAnd here to help us with that is\nnone other than Mister Mark Ingram.\n\n8\n00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.620\nHow's it going Mark?\n\n9\n00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.370\n>> Good Mike, thanks very much.\n\n10\n00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.531\nSo we're still in the interface and\nif you've been following along or\n\n11\n00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:39.931\neven if you haven't there's\nother episodes to review.\n\n12\n00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:41.610\nSo let's look at search settings.\n\n13\n00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.470\nWe have whole other sections,\nepisodes, just on search, but\n\n14\n00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.010\nI wanna introduce you to what is available\nat the farm level as an overview.\n\n15\n00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.030\nSo if I click on Farm Search\nAdministration, still in the SharePoint\n\n16\n00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.030\ncentral admin site, we can see here, I\ncan specify a Search Service Application.\n\n17\n00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.310\nLet's click on that, see what happens.\n\n18\n00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.994\nOkay, and we have a topology here for\n\n19\n00:01:13.994 --> 00:01:17.218\nour search application.\n\n20\n00:01:17.218 --> 00:01:21.411\nAnd at this point, since we've\ninstalled all components on one server,\n\n21\n00:01:21.411 --> 00:01:23.853\nit doesnât make as much sense as it might.\n\n22\n00:01:23.853 --> 00:01:27.540\nGenerally you'd wanna separate out\nroles on the separate machines.\n\n23\n00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.762\nFor example, you might have the separate\nmachine dedicated just to crawling.\n\n24\n00:01:30.762 --> 00:01:33.387\nEspecially if you have\na lot of content indexed,\n\n25\n00:01:33.387 --> 00:01:35.900\nthat could be a full-time\njob just crawling.\n\n26\n00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.424\nAnd then also, depending on how\ncurrent the search results need to be.\n\n27\n00:01:41.424 --> 00:01:44.338\nHistorical data that hasn't changed,\nyou just need to search once.\n\n28\n00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:47.701\nBut if it's volatile data or\na lot of changes get made to your content,\n\n29\n00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:51.929\nit's important that users searching for\nthat content get the most up-to-date data.\n\n30\n00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.754\nThen it's not unrealistic to search\ncontents more than twice a day,\n\n31\n00:01:56.754 --> 00:01:58.685\ncertain content sources.\n\n32\n00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:02.435\nOther times, once ever is enough or\ndaily, even weekly,\n\n33\n00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:06.095\ncrawls might be appropriate for\ncertain content types in your environment.\n\n34\n00:02:06.095 --> 00:02:09.095\nBut the point is,\nit can add quite a heavy load.\n\n35\n00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:14.605\nSo, larger firms would have a separate\nserver just for crawling content.\n\n36\n00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.000\nThere's a crawl database as well.\n\n37\n00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.550\nSo, always good to have a separate\nphysical drive for that.\n\n38\n00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.350\nAdministration database, so\nwe looked, at a different episode,\n\n39\n00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.370\nat all the databases that\nlive in a SharePoint context.\n\n40\n00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.177\nAnd more are created depending on\nthe service apps we have in use and\n\n41\n00:02:30.177 --> 00:02:32.147\nthe functionality we\nintroduced in our farm.\n\n42\n00:02:32.147 --> 00:02:36.631\nIt will naturally and automatically\ncreate the necessary database or\n\n43\n00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:41.300\ndatabases depending on what\nthe service application is.\n\n44\n00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.930\nOkay, Search Center URL, that is a special\nsite template users can go to which\n\n45\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.240\nyou can customize, just like anything\nelse in SharePoint, to have fields.\n\n46\n00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.206\nFor example for customer ID, patient ID,\nsupplier number, part number, etc., or\n\n47\n00:02:56.206 --> 00:02:59.212\njust leave the standard\nsingle search field there.\n\n48\n00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:04.178\nThere's also other ways of filtering\nscope so you can set up, and\n\n49\n00:03:04.178 --> 00:03:08.061\nDefault Content Access Account\nis listed there and\n\n50\n00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:10.810\na contact email address for crawl.\n\n51\n00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.470\nSo you might be impacting\nsomeone's content,\n\n52\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.470\nthey might want to contact you,\nthe owner of that crawl service, saying,\n\n53\n00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.570\nlook you're putting too\nmuch load on our server.\n\n54\n00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.830\nOr you might try to index microsoft.com\nfor example, probably not a good idea.\n\n55\n00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.310\nBut you need to be contactable or\n\n56\n00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.900\nelse they could just block you from\nsearching their content all together.\n\n57\n00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.790\nAll right, so this is all I\nwanted to show you on that page,\n\n58\n00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.205\nlet's go over to\nthe left-hand side though.\n\n59\n00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:42.480\nSo in the later episodes we'll be\nlooking at different settings here,\n\n60\n00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.660\nlike a crawl log, how to specify and\nset up new content sources to crawl.\n\n61\n00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.820\nAnd then other terms, authoritative pages,\nresult sources, and likes.\n\n62\n00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.400\nThat's just a little teaser,\nwe'll have at least one, possibly two, or\n\n63\n00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.050\npossibly even three episodes just\non search, later on in the week.\n\n64\n00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.790\nAll right, now, let's go back,\nTo crawler impact rules.\n\n65\n00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.580\nAgain, we'll cover that\nwhen we get to search.\n\n66\n00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.499\nAnd there's one more thing I\nwanna show you here on apps.\n\n67\n00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.178\nOkay, so here is where we can\npurchase applications, or\n\n68\n00:04:19.178 --> 00:04:20.370\napps as they're now known as.\n\n69\n00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.660\nManage our licensing.\n\n70\n00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.190\nWe can also monitor apps from here,\napp permissions.\n\n71\n00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.170\nThese are subjects we'll get into more in\nthe advanced course in a different week.\n\n72\n00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.230\nAnd then Office 365 settings as well.\n\n73\n00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.545\nSo, here is a link to configure\nHybrid OneDrive and sites features.\n\n74\n00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:41.191\nSo OneDrive hasn't been the best,\nfrankly, with SharePoint.\n\n75\n00:04:41.191 --> 00:04:44.474\nTo this version there's definitely\nimprovements have been made to make\n\n76\n00:04:44.474 --> 00:04:47.950\nseamless integration between OneDrive and\nyour SharePoint deployments.\n\n77\n00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.870\nAnd then you can specify\naudiences here and\n\n78\n00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.250\nturn off Hybrid or\nenable OneDrive or OneDrive in site.\n\n79\n00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.180\nSo you can redirect certain content\nto OneDrive or OneDrive for\n\n80\n00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.910\nBusiness storage locations.\n\n81\n00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.870\nThis is more of an advanced\nfeature as well.\n\n82\n00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.296\nAnd configuration wizards,\n\n83\n00:05:07.296 --> 00:05:11.090\nwe showed you in a different episode\nhow to set up front-end configuration.\n\n84\n00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.418\nIf you want to revisit\nthe front-end configuration wizard,\n\n85\n00:05:14.418 --> 00:05:19.380\nhere's how you access that, and\nyou can make settings changes as needed.\n\n86\n00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.718\nBut we've already stepped\nyou through that,\n\n87\n00:05:20.718 --> 00:05:23.120\nI'm just showing where you can go if\nyou wanna make changes via a wizard.\n\n88\n00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.970\nOf course there is other\nways to make change as well.\n\n89\n00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.630\nSome people are comfortable with\nthe wizard, some people like to do just\n\n90\n00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.090\nspecific tasks or even PowerShell to\nscript the change, you have options there.\n\n91\n00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.044\n>> So, this is basically the same\nwizard we saw when we installed it,\n\n92\n00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:39.120\nso if we didn't add a feature and\nnow we wanna try that feature,\n\n93\n00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.140\nthis is the wizard we that we could\ngo to get that installed again.\n\n94\n00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.480\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n95\n00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.230\nSo let's just look, to finish up\non the central admin section here,\n\n96\n00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.800\nthere's a little gear icon\nwhich is now the standard for\n\n97\n00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.110\nsettings in Microsoft technologies.\n\n98\n00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.090\nYou probably know that already.\n\n99\n00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.518\nAll right, so I can share with, So,\n\n100\n00:05:59.518 --> 00:06:03.552\nI can invite people to participate or\naccess this page, but again there's\n\n101\n00:06:03.552 --> 00:06:07.795\nreasons why we don't do that, we restrict\nthe group, the forum admin group.\n\n102\n00:06:07.795 --> 00:06:11.870\nI could add an app,\nhere I could look at site contents.\n\n103\n00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.400\nThis gives me a listing\nof contents in the site,\n\n104\n00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.070\nwe'll cover this more when we\nget into site collections.\n\n105\n00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.160\nThere's also Site Settings.\n\n106\n00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.790\nAnd again, we'll cover this when we get\ninto our site collections and sites.\n\n107\n00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.010\nNow, what else do we have here?\n\n108\n00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:34.272\nWe have this little full-screen icon\nfocused on content, notice how if\n\n109\n00:06:34.272 --> 00:06:40.460\nI click on the button, the click launch\non the left-hand side disappears.\n\n110\n00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.010\nWhy do we have this functionality?\n\n111\n00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:47.490\nWell some people are using small form\nfactors and every inch or two inches of\n\n112\n00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:53.510\nscreen real estate we can save or use to\nfocus on what we're looking for is better.\n\n113\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.970\nSo it's a toggle and the quick launch will\nappear and disappear with that toggle.\n\n114\n00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.860\nNow, what else can I do here.\n\n115\n00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.180\nI can, let's say, add an app.\n\n116\n00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.800\nOkay, so\nI can add a functionality to the site.\n\n117\n00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.160\nSo, for example,\na document library if I wanted.\n\n118\n00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.390\nThis could pertain to farm\nlevel restore information.\n\n119\n00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.270\nNow you might think, okay,\nif the farm needs restoring,\n\n120\n00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.280\nwhy would I store the recovered\ndocuments in the farm?\n\n121\n00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.930\nWhich is probably down.\n\n122\n00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.574\nWell, that's an excellent question.\n\n123\n00:07:26.574 --> 00:07:30.470\nSo you wanna have them off-premises,\nmaybe even printed out in hard copy, or\n\n124\n00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.030\nmaybe stored in the cloud somewhere so\n\n125\n00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.570\nyou could access the recovery documents\nthat you need when you need them.\n\n126\n00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.530\nMaybe there's some hurricane or something,\nand you can't access your office.\n\n127\n00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.950\nSo other functionality we can add,\ncontacts, calendars, etc.\n\n128\n00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.580\nBut again, more on this when we get\ninto our site collections and sites.\n\n129\n00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.510\nAnd we'll also cover editing pages then.\n\n130\n00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:58.360\nSo SharePoint Store,\nlet's just visit that while we're here.\n\n131\n00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.130\nAnd okay, so this,\n\n132\n00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.450\nI always love it when it says, contact\nyour network administrator for assistance.\n\n133\n00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.150\nI am the network administrator!\n\n134\n00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.680\nGive me a little more here.\n\n135\n00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.280\nSo apps are turned off, it says,\n\n136\n00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.810\nif I know who runs the server,\ntell them to enable apps, hilarious.\n\n137\n00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.290\nOkay, so there's some featured apps.\n\n138\n00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:19.570\nSo, you've probably been to an app\nstore for Google, or Apple,\n\n139\n00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:24.220\nor Microsoft before, there's a lot of the\napps are free, others you have to license.\n\n140\n00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:29.023\nAnd again, we looked at in a different\nepisode how we can restrict the end-user\n\n141\n00:08:29.023 --> 00:08:34.273\nfrom accessing apps, maybe you just allow\nthem to access only apps you pre-approve.\n\n142\n00:08:34.273 --> 00:08:36.814\nSo there's a gallery,\na page they can go to and\n\n143\n00:08:36.814 --> 00:08:41.065\nthey're allowed to use any web part or\napps that they can find in the gallery.\n\n144\n00:08:41.065 --> 00:08:46.846\nBut they don't have the ability to\ndownload and install apps willy-nilly.\n\n145\n00:08:46.846 --> 00:08:48.940\nSo I'll let you search those.\n\n146\n00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.490\n>> They can get carried away\nif given the permission.\n\n147\n00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.491\n>> Yeah, and\nthen you have to clean up the mess, right,\n\n148\n00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:57.893\nif there's some security risk\nthat's exposed somehow, or\n\n149\n00:08:57.893 --> 00:09:01.315\nsome undesirable or\nunexpected interaction between apps.\n\n150\n00:09:01.315 --> 00:09:04.600\nThat is not good.\n\n151\n00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.161\nAll right, Mark.\n\n152\n00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:09.208\nAgain, a great look at the myriad of\nsettings, the plethora of settings that\n\n153\n00:09:09.208 --> 00:09:14.130\nwe've got available when configuring our\nSharePoint farm, so we thank you for that.\n\n154\n00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.340\nHope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n155\n00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.600\nRemember, this was a part five, so\nif you didn't see the setting that you're\n\n156\n00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.980\nlooking for information on, go back and\ncheck out those other parts.\n\n157\n00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.650\nHope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n158\n00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.180\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n159\n00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:26.770\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n160\n00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.204\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n161\n00:09:29.225 --> 00:09:36.459\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

host,\n\n3\n00:00:15.988 --> 00:00:16.746\nMike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:19.730\nToday we're doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.110\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.480\nwe're gonna be looking at creating web\napplications and site collections.\n\n7\n00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.800\nWe've already spent a lot of time in\nthe planning phase, get everything ready.\n\n8\n00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.640\nAnd then we got SharePoint installed and\n\n9\n00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.970\nwe went through our farm settings\nthat we have to configure.\n\n10\n00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.500\nNow we're ready for\n\n11\n00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.590\nthe next step, if we think about that\nhierarchy that Mark's tought us about.\n\n12\n00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.490\nYou got the farm at the top, right below\nthat then is the web applications,\n\n13\n00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.850\nthey contain our site collections,\nthey contain our sites.\n\n14\n00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.915\nSo the next logical step would be\nto create some web applications and\n\n15\n00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:49.328\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n16\n00:00:49.328 --> 00:00:52.600\nAnd here to do it for us is Mr.\nMark Ingram, how's it going, Mark?\n\n17\n00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.180\n>> Great, thanks very much, Mike.\n\n18\n00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.360\nAll right, let's continue on, so we're\ngonna dive into web applications now.\n\n19\n00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.440\nSo a little review, a web app,\n\n20\n00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.880\nit's Microsoft gives IIS\nextended capabilities.\n\n21\n00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.400\nSuper powers if you will,\n\n22\n00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.460\nto host SharePoint related content\nlike site collections and sites.\n\n23\n00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.340\nThink of it like extending the schema for\nexchange for\n\n24\n00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.350\nexample, you can do more\nthings once we've done this.\n\n25\n00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.200\nSo I'll click on Manage web applications.\n\n26\n00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.792\nYou could see here two existing\nweb apps by a SharePoint 80,\n\n27\n00:01:29.792 --> 00:01:34.071\nthat's when I click the side not\non the list item, SharePoint 80.\n\n28\n00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:38.593\nBut beside it, there's a whole\nblue bar that highlights and\n\n29\n00:01:38.593 --> 00:01:44.460\nnow it exposes ribbon functionally in\nterms of buttons for General Settings.\n\n30\n00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.255\nLet's look at those, so\nthe tour of the interface continues.\n\n31\n00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:52.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> These are also farm-related settings,\n\n32\n00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.190\nbut specifically related to web apps, so\n\n33\n00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.530\nnow is a great time to\ndrill down into them.\n\n34\n00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.868\nAnd then we'll actually create a web app.\n\n35\n00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:02.220\nAll right, so I can choose\nthings like Default time zone.\n\n36\n00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.260\nThat's interesting, I didn't know\nthere's an International Date Line West,\n\n37\n00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.105\nthat's a time zone.\n\n38\n00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:08.920\n>> [LAUGH] I did not know that either.\n\n39\n00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.940\n>> I'm sure I've crossed the date\nline but, okay, I digress.\n\n40\n00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.310\nAnd then we only have one\nuser settings profile,\n\n41\n00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.400\nthat's an advance topic we will get into.\n\n42\n00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.908\nQuota templates, we can set up additional\ntemplates if we want or not use a quota.\n\n43\n00:02:24.908 --> 00:02:28.553\nI'm always a fan of quotas to\nprevent runaway storage growth and\n\n44\n00:02:28.553 --> 00:02:33.730\nforce users to prioritize what information\nshould be stored in a SharePoint context.\n\n45\n00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.750\nAnd then maybe also prune away old content\nor move it to some other form of storage.\n\n46\n00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.330\nOr worst case scenario, maybe they ask for\nan increase in quota for\n\n47\n00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.165\nsome business reason not\nto upload movies from home.\n\n48\n00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:48.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then you can grant them or\n\n49\n00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.018\ndeny that request to increase the quota.\n\n50\n00:02:51.018 --> 00:02:55.400\nBut you wanna get a handle on storage\nbecause some companies are more nimble\n\n51\n00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.710\nthat others in terms of just automatically\napproving spending for new hard drives.\n\n52\n00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.596\nNew storage for example.\n\n53\n00:03:01.596 --> 00:03:08.450\nAll right, there's settings here for\npresence settings, so online status.\n\n54\n00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.690\nThat's really handy especially if\nyou're in a multi-national environment.\n\n55\n00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.510\nYou're not sure when you\ncan reach someone by phone,\n\n56\n00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.340\nbut by using Presence Awareness you\nknow how to contact them and when.\n\n57\n00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.290\nAlerts, we covered alerts\nin a different episode.\n\n58\n00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.290\nThat's where I can be, as a user,\nnotified of changes to content for\n\n59\n00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.460\nexample, maybe a document I authored.\n\n60\n00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.170\nI can be notified by an alert,\nwhenever the content changes or\n\n61\n00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.269\na new document has reached\nthe document library.\n\n62\n00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.930\nAs a farm admin,\n\n63\n00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.340\nI can be alerted when certain conditions\noccur like low disk space for example.\n\n64\n00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.440\nLet's see, so we're not gonna\ncover all the settings here.\n\n65\n00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.210\nBrowser file handling sessions here.\n\n66\n00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.500\nSo should certain kinds of downloads\nprompt interaction from the user.\n\n67\n00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.310\nDifferent mime types and\n\n68\n00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.020\nso you may require a download of\ncertain content as opposed to opening.\n\n69\n00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:14.330\nSecurity validation here, so\nin terms of filling out form fields,\n\n70\n00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.660\nhow much time you have to fill them\nout before having to reenter settings.\n\n71\n00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.590\nName and password in email, so\n\n72\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.080\nthere's different ways of granting\naccess to users, access to some site.\n\n73\n00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.818\nYou could phone them up or email them or\n\n74\n00:04:31.818 --> 00:04:37.330\nhave SharePoint automatically sent\nusername password combinations.\n\n75\n00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.680\nYou may have a policy that\nprevents that kind of action.\n\n76\n00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.740\nYou may require postal mail potentially or\na phone call to deliver that information.\n\n77\n00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.190\nOkay, and Recycle Bin status.\n\n78\n00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.710\nSo, one of the more recent\ndevelopments in SharePoint land\n\n79\n00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.210\nis the concept of a second\nstage recycle bin.\n\n80\n00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.830\nSo if you've ever had to restore\na single item from a backup or\n\n81\n00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.050\na single email message.\n\n82\n00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.730\nYou know how much of a hassle it could be\njust to get that one document or email.\n\n83\n00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.580\nSo with the Recycle Bin,\n\n84\n00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.720\nusers can recover their own\ndocuments up to 30 days by default.\n\n85\n00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.530\nAnd beyond that,\nlet's say I'm responsible for\n\n86\n00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.490\na site or created a site,\nmy 30 day time period has been exceeded.\n\n87\n00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.630\nI realize I really needed that\ndocument from six weeks ago,\n\n88\n00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.540\nI can contact my site\ncollection administrator.\n\n89\n00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.200\nAnd they have a second\nstage recycle bin and\n\n90\n00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.980\nmagically they're able to restore the item\nthat I thought might be lost forever.\n\n91\n00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:43.570\nOr would require hassle of\nrestoring from backup for example.\n\n92\n00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.370\nTo prevent runaway growth of recycle\nbin data, you can restrict data,\n\n93\n00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.960\nit would be a first in first out scenario.\n\n94\n00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.830\nFor the second stage recycle bin,\nthe default is 50% of the live site quota\n\n95\n00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.380\nin addition to the site quota utilized for\nthe second stage recycle bin.\n\n96\n00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.050\nOr I can turn off the recycle\nbin all together at the first or\n\n97\n00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.420\nsecond stage level.\n\n98\n00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:12.480\nThe maximum upload size by default\nis two gigs or 2,047 megabytes.\n\n99\n00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.620\nThat is for one file at a time or\nany group of files that you may upload.\n\n100\n00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.530\nSo if you have files,\nif you wanna upload 10 files,\n\n101\n00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.590\nthey're three gigs total, you just have to\nbreak that up into two separate uploads.\n\n102\n00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.580\nAnd then here's your customer\nexperience improvement program,\n\n103\n00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.050\nwe talked about in another episode.\n\n104\n00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.440\nGiving performance data to Microsoft,\nso they can improve the product.\n\n105\n00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.460\nAnd then also there's cookie status\nas well that you can enable or not.\n\n106\n00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.970\nSo those are the web\napplication general settings.\n\n107\n00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.500\nThose are specific to a given web app\n\n108\n00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.400\nwhich happens to be\nhighlighted down below.\n\n109\n00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.850\nSo if I wanted to change the settings for\nthe SharePoint Central Admin web app.\n\n110\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.130\nThen I have to select that first.\n\n111\n00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:57.410\nWe're going back to General Settings now\nand Resource Throttling, this is handy.\n\n112\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.120\nSo we have default thresholds for\nlist view.\n\n113\n00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.100\nSo in other words, number of items\nthe database operation can invoke.\n\n114\n00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.430\nAnd for others and admins, we can\nsee a 20,000 object list view there.\n\n115\n00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.400\nNow large queries,\njust like we'd have large print job,\n\n116\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.610\nwe can schedule them to\nrun at a certain time.\n\n117\n00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.720\nTypically overnight, so\nas not to impact other users.\n\n118\n00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.010\nSimilarly large queries,\n\n119\n00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.990\nthey're gonna have a major performance\nin on the database and our SQL Server.\n\n120\n00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.098\nWe can schedule to occur in a window,\n\n121\n00:07:31.098 --> 00:07:33.860\nmaybe a one hour range overnight for\nexample.\n\n122\n00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.060\nThis one is always extreme,\nI don't know why they need somebody.\n\n123\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.705\nBut number of unique\npermissions on the list,\n\n124\n00:07:41.705 --> 00:07:46.570\n50,000 unique permissions,\nthat is bizarre.\n\n125\n00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.753\nSurely 50 would have been enough.\n\n126\n00:07:49.753 --> 00:07:54.403\nThe others are advanced topics,\nwe don't get into in this course.\n\n127\n00:07:54.403 --> 00:07:59.284\nBack up to General Settings again and\nWorkflow All right, so\n\n128\n00:07:59.284 --> 00:08:04.010\ndo we want to allow for\nuser define workflows?\n\n129\n00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.900\nYes or no.\nWe'll talk about workflows a little more\n\n130\n00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.300\nlater on, we get into our\nsight collection discussion,\n\n131\n00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.750\nwhich is coming up in a future episode.\n\n132\n00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.360\nAll right, so\n\n133\n00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.450\nshould you just be allowed to initiate\nworkflows, is the question there.\n\n134\n00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.220\nAnd then,\nlet's say we have a workflow task, and\n\n135\n00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.835\nagain, whatever you can dream up in\nterms of complexity we can handle.\n\n136\n00:08:25.835 --> 00:08:28.465\nin the workflow,\nyou might need SharePoint Designer, or for\n\n137\n00:08:28.465 --> 00:08:31.525\nmore complexity Visual Studio,\nbut it can be done.\n\n138\n00:08:31.525 --> 00:08:34.375\nSo sometimes you're gonna\nhave tasks assigned to people\n\n139\n00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:36.385\nthat are outside the organization.\n\n140\n00:08:36.385 --> 00:08:38.875\nSo do you want to allow that?\n\n141\n00:08:38.875 --> 00:08:43.835\nAnd also, let's say, again,\nsomeone outside the organization,\n\n142\n00:08:43.835 --> 00:08:46.665\nmaybe a contractor if they're\ninvolved in the workflow,\n\n143\n00:08:46.665 --> 00:08:49.269\nshould they get copies of documents?\n\n144\n00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.730\nThose are some settings options there and\n\n145\n00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:59.960\noutgoing email.\n\n146\n00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.880\nSo earlier we looked at outgoing\nemail settings for the farm.\n\n147\n00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.960\nOnce those are set up then we can\noptionally enable work flow, sorry.\n\n148\n00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.850\nEmail settings on a per web app basis but\nit all starts with the farm.\n\n149\n00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.608\nIf they're not enabled at the farm level\nwe don't get the ability to set them up at\n\n150\n00:09:17.608 --> 00:09:18.505\nthe web app level.\n\n151\n00:09:22.127 --> 00:09:26.714\nGlobal account settings here,\nsimilarly we have farm settings and\n\n152\n00:09:26.714 --> 00:09:28.729\nlower down web app settings.\n\n153\n00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.690\nAnd share point designer.\n\n154\n00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.180\nWhether or\nnot to name all share point designer for\n\n155\n00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.390\nall sites hosted within a given web app.\n\n156\n00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:45.090\nThen we have other buttons up here for\nuser policy and honest policy,\n\n157\n00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:45.960\npermission policies.\n\n158\n00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.549\nWe've looked at those,\nwe've also looked at blocked file types.\n\n159\n00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.250\nOkay, so let's go and\ntake the plunge and click on New.\n\n160\n00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.510\nIt's so exciting.\n\n161\n00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:57.840\n>> I am excited.\n\n162\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:59.480\n>> I'm excited too.\n\n163\n00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.130\n>> Drum roll.\n\n164\n00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.040\n>> Okay.\n\n165\n00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:08.660\nSo we could either use an existing\nwebsite or create a new website.\n\n166\n00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.670\nI'll create a new website.\n\n167\n00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.320\nNotice how there's a port\nnumber suggested here.\n\n168\n00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.370\nThat seems a little long to me.\n\n169\n00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:20.148\nI'm gonna come back to that\n\n170\n00:10:20.148 --> 00:10:27.250\nbecause, Yes, okay, so\nwe go back up there.\n\n171\n00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:32.550\nLet's just say I'll call it SharePoint,\nwoah, no.\n\n172\n00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.490\nThat was weird.\n\n173\n00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.260\nI hit my back button and\nsomething screwed up.\n\n174\n00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.030\nBut that's okay, we'll go back in there.\n\n175\n00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:49.482\nNew No net, ladies and gentlemen, no net.\n\n176\n00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.930\n>> [LAUGH] that's right, this is live.\n\n177\n00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:52.780\n>> Indeed.\n\n178\n00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.010\nOkay, so a new website.\n\n179\n00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.180\nLet's notice how it came up with\na different default number.\n\n180\n00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.041\nLet's call this SharePoint Demo.\n\n181\n00:11:02.956 --> 00:11:07.317\nAnd let's use a, well,\n\n182\n00:11:07.317 --> 00:11:10.650\nactually, yeah.\n\n183\n00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.000\nLet's use port number.\n\n184\n00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.020\nWe have a combination.\n\n185\n00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.650\nWe can use either port number or\ncome up with a host header.\n\n186\n00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:22.390\nHost header's nice because Then we could\nuse the standard port 80 if we wanted.\n\n187\n00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.100\nBut either way works.\n\n188\n00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.790\nLets keep it at port number\none one one one one.\n\n189\n00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.460\nTheres the path here under C.\n\n190\n00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.440\nDo I want to allow anonymous access?\n\n191\n00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.810\nLet's say no.\n\n192\n00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:37.730\nSSL?\n\n193\n00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:38.780\nNo.\n\n194\n00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.600\nAnd here's the options for\nforum based authentication,\n\n195\n00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.020\nI'll keep it the default\nwhich is Windows NTLM.\n\n196\n00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:50.790\nAnd there's my URL, okay.\n\n197\n00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.360\nThe zone, so\nwe have different zone options.\n\n198\n00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:56.880\nI'll just leave it at the default zone.\n\n199\n00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.460\nNow, Do I want to create\na new application pool?\n\n200\n00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:05.380\nRemember, think of an application pool\nas if we're carving out a section of RAM\n\n201\n00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.470\njust for\nour web app in this new application pool.\n\n202\n00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:14.210\nYou can have more then one web app\nper application pool if you wanted.\n\n203\n00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:19.120\nFor ultimate security separation though\nyou have a dedicated app pool per web app.\n\n204\n00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:26.920\nBut keep in mind, it's like it carves out\nmaybe 200 to 300 megabytes of ram, so\n\n205\n00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:33.200\ndon't just be, have a reason for\ncreating a new application pool.\n\n206\n00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.844\nIt's definitely your SharePoint\n[INAUDIBLE] site deserves its own\n\n207\n00:12:35.844 --> 00:12:38.060\napplication pool for security reasons But\n\n208\n00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:43.330\nthere's no reason you cannot combine other\nweb apps in a single application pool.\n\n209\n00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:47.170\nAnother option here is to use\nan existing application pool.\n\n210\n00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.920\nBut just for kicks,\nI'm gonna create a new application pool.\n\n211\n00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.180\nAnd then here's my security account for\nthe app pool.\n\n212\n00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:59.200\nIn other words, that account will be used\nto interact With content in that pool,\n\n213\n00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.720\nthere's a database server now the content\nname this is am extraordinary amount of\n\n214\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.230\ngobbledy gook that appears at the end so\nI always like to trim that and\n\n215\n00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:12.600\ngive the database name something\nintelligent, let's say content for demo\n\n216\n00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:18.340\nand I'll use Window's authentication I\ncould use SQL authentication if I wanted.\n\n217\n00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.260\nFill out the database server.\n\n218\n00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.860\nWe don't have one so\nI'll leave that blank.\n\n219\n00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:27.740\nOkay so here is some service\napplication connectors, so\n\n220\n00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:32.900\nI can create a custom sub-set of\nservice applications if I wanted, or\n\n221\n00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.480\njust leave all the defaults for now.\n\n222\n00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.260\nI'll leave the defaults, I'll say yes,\ncustomer experience improvement program.\n\n223\n00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.970\nAnd it says this shouldn't\ntake long which is true.\n\n224\n00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.920\nSo just going back to one\nof those settings options,\n\n225\n00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.300\nI chose a port number\ninstead of host headers.\n\n226\n00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.290\nIf I had chosen a host header\nthen I would go into DNS and\n\n227\n00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:54.110\nmake sure that host header\nresolves to this server 01.\n\n228\n00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.860\nSo it actually saves a step.\n\n229\n00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.730\nThe only problem is that users\nhate typing in port numbers,\n\n230\n00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.340\nthey can often be confused by them.\n\n231\n00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:07.260\nNow if you set up a site or cycle action,\nyour URL is set up as a favorite then\n\n232\n00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.390\nno big deal because they don't have to\ntype they can just choose a favorite.\n\n233\n00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:15.740\nOr link to that site or site collection\nfrom somewhere else in the SharePoint\n\n234\n00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:20.240\nhierarchy, so there's various I'll juts\ntalk about navigation while we're waiting\n\n235\n00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:26.110\nfor this web app to be created so You want\nto just like we talked about in another\n\n236\n00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:32.520\nepisode not overloading the quick links on\nthe left, the quick launch links rather.\n\n237\n00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:37.980\nSimilarly you don't want necessarily\na whole bunch of tabs across the top or\n\n238\n00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.650\nnear the top of your screen\nbecause it becomes confusing.\n\n239\n00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:46.620\nSome tabs, great, too many tabs,\nTough to navigate.\n\n240\n00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.330\nSo we'll look when we get into\nsite collection settings at\n\n241\n00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.740\ndifferent navigation options.\n\n242\n00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.340\nYou can also display tree\nnavigation on the left-hand side.\n\n243\n00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.820\nSo if you view as Windows Explorer,\n\n244\n00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.625\nI'm sure you have,\nyou're familiar with that folder,\n\n245\n00:14:58.625 --> 00:15:02.660\nsub-folder hierarchy which you can expand\nor contract by clicking on plus or minus.\n\n246\n00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.900\nSimilar kind of idea with site navigation.\n\n247\n00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.950\nSo you always wanna make it users or\nemployees, or whoever's interact with our\n\n248\n00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:13.050\nsites, make it really easy for\nthem to either get where they need to go,\n\n249\n00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:17.680\neither by navigating or\nsearch box or some shortcut links.\n\n250\n00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.210\nAnd they should also easily\nknow where they are.\n\n251\n00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:26.900\nSo this book I referenced in another\nepisode, Ambient Findability,\n\n252\n00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.290\nBy O'Reilly press, I forgot the author.\n\n253\n00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:34.850\nWe talked about various\nways of navigating back in.\n\n254\n00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:39.080\nYou know, when we were hunting dinosaurs,\nwe needed to know where the good hunting\n\n255\n00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.290\ngrounds were, or buffalo, and\nhow to get back to the cave.\n\n256\n00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.550\nA more wanted example, the London\nUnderground tube system, subway.\n\n257\n00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:50.751\nSo we had a perimeter,\nwithin which all the nodes existed,\n\n258\n00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:56.211\neach node would be a subway station and\nthen various routes to get from A to B and\n\n259\n00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:58.999\nSo one example of course are web pages.\n\n260\n00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:00.810\nWe have different ways of navigating.\n\n261\n00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:07.020\nWe can use the browser back button,\nforward button, links, tabs.\n\n262\n00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.660\nWe have what's called\na bread crumb trail and\n\n263\n00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.600\nthat is a series of links near the top\nof you're screen to share a point.\n\n264\n00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:19.400\nAnd so if you wanna skip back say two\nlinks instead of clicking a link,\n\n265\n00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:24.410\nor a back button once, and a second time\nyou can get directly where you wanna go.\n\n266\n00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.980\nSo you have choice when it\ncomes to navigation, but\n\n267\n00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.320\npeople always need to\nknow where they are now.\n\n268\n00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.690\nAnd we're gonna get back to a previous\npoint in time, so a lot of organizations\n\n269\n00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:41.940\nwill have maybe a company logo,\na little image of a company logo.\n\n270\n00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.220\nAnd when you click on that they\nautomatically get back to the home page.\n\n271\n00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.280\nSo they're never more than one click\naway from the home page in case they\n\n272\n00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.480\ngo down some tunnel and get lost.\n\n273\n00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.700\n>> Easy to do sometimes.\n\n274\n00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.200\n>> Indeed.\n\n275\n00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.690\nIndeed.\n>> So we're still waiting this web app.\n\n276\n00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.280\nIt's taking a little longer than normal.\n\n277\n00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.480\nBut it shouldn't take too much longer.\n\n278\n00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.040\nMaybe a minute max.\n\n279\n00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.660\n>> Just kick it one time or something.\n\n280\n00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.350\n>> Yes, that's true.\n\n281\n00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:06.445\nWhat would the Fonz do?\n\n282\n00:17:06.445 --> 00:17:09.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Smack him aside, hey.\n\n283\n00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:14.730\n>> That's right\n>> Through the miracle of television and\n\n284\n00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:20.150\nstop pause action, we eliminated some time\nthere and now the web app's being created.\n\n285\n00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:25.010\nYou get a blur here, this dialogue saying\nthere's some extra configuration to do,\n\n286\n00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.590\nif you set up with forum space\nauthentication, we didn't.\n\n287\n00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.680\nWe use the default Windows\nauthentication and\n\n288\n00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.340\nalso if we had a multi-server environment\nthat we'd have to wait a little while.\n\n289\n00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:40.010\nSo IS could do it's magic on all\nour web front end servers, but\n\n290\n00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:46.140\nwe just have a single server\nhosting all roles for this demo, so\n\n291\n00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:51.570\nthat's good, and then I can click on the\ncreate site collection page now or later.\n\n292\n00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:56.567\nI'll do it now Remember,\n\n293\n00:17:56.567 --> 00:18:03.020\nevery web app can have one and\nonly one root site collection.\n\n294\n00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:07.360\nAnd that gets the shortest possible URL.\n\n295\n00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:11.880\nSo we can see here,\nwe've got the http:// Server 01,\n\n296\n00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.540\nthat's the server name,\ncolon, port, 11111,\n\n297\n00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:19.360\nthat's the port name I selected when I\ncreated the web app, and then a slash and\n\n298\n00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:24.220\nso whatever I type in a little later\nwill be the route site collection.\n\n299\n00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:29.090\nI could also, if I wanted,\ncreate the new site\n\n300\n00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:33.449\nunder the slash sites\nsection of the url hierarchy.\n\n301\n00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.270\nAfter I create the initial site collection\n\n302\n00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.660\nthis slash option will not be\navailable to future site collections.\n\n303\n00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.260\nIn other words, they'll have to\ncreate new sites under slash sites or\n\n304\n00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:49.250\nanother managed path that I may set\nup like /personal or /corporate or\n\n305\n00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:53.850\n/HR, whatever I want to set up to\nhave a so-called managed path.\n\n306\n00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:57.580\nSo I give it a title,\nI'll call it Demo Site.\n\n307\n00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.570\nI know, not very imaginative.\n\n308\n00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:00.690\nThat's okay.\n\n309\n00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.670\nAnd then let's see.\n\n310\n00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.640\nLet's go, Team Site is fine.\n\n311\n00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.840\nNow this people picker is very handy.\n\n312\n00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.500\nI'll type in a few letters of a username.\n\n313\n00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.450\nAnd if I hit Enter or\nclick on the people picker,\n\n314\n00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:15.970\nthat's the little person\nicon with a check mark.\n\n315\n00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:20.500\nIt will come back with a little\n\n316\n00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.458\nred wrinkly line reminiscent of\nCharlie Brown's t-shirt design.\n\n317\n00:19:25.458 --> 00:19:28.200\nThis means I can click on it and\n\n318\n00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.530\nit says multiple entries\nmatched when I hover over.\n\n319\n00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:36.350\nSo when I click Actually, there's one\nentry here, and that's the one I wanted my\n\n320\n00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:40.630\nacme slash administrator accounts, that's\ndomain name backslash administrator.\n\n321\n00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:45.490\nIf there was more than one username that\nmatched up to the number of characters I\n\n322\n00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:49.420\nhad typed in, then they would all be\nlisted there and I could choose one.\n\n323\n00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.910\nI like doing it this way A because is\nmore efficient, Not lazy, more efficient.\n\n324\n00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:59.310\nAnd it gives me confidence\nthat I have correctly selected\n\n325\n00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:03.040\na valid username as opposed to hitting\nOK later then getting feedback.\n\n326\n00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.830\nThat was invalid, fix it.\n\n327\n00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:05.650\nSo I'll select that.\n\n328\n00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.440\nAnd notice how it's a verified username.\n\n329\n00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.120\nHow do we know, because it's underlined.\n\n330\n00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.940\nHm.\n>> Now, in another episode we talked about\n\n331\n00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.920\nthe benefit of having a secondary\nsite collection administrator.\n\n332\n00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:22.130\nIn fact, we could require entry of\na secondary site collection administrator\n\n333\n00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:26.390\nbefore site collection\ncreation could ensue.\n\n334\n00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.760\nWhy?\nBecause that way it's more likely that\n\n335\n00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.460\nusers needing access for example to\nresources hosted to site collection Or\n\n336\n00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.930\nwanna be part of a group that accesses it.\n\n337\n00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:41.840\nMore likely to look at a response if two\npeople get emails rather than just one.\n\n338\n00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.680\nBut for now I'll leave that Secondary\nSite Collection Distributer blank.\n\n339\n00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.580\nAnd then I choose a quota template here.\n\n340\n00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.640\nYou're not limited, by the way,\nto either no quota or personal site.\n\n341\n00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.380\nI can create any number of\nquota templates if I want.\n\n342\n00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.760\nSay for managers, executives, etc.\n\n343\n00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.070\nor not use quotas at all.\n\n344\n00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:01.260\nAnd here is a link here.\n\n345\n00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.360\nUnfortunately, if I were to\nclick on Manage Quota Templates,\n\n346\n00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.230\nI'd lose whatever fields I've\nfilled out in the form already.\n\n347\n00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:11.170\nSo you might think that they would make\nit user friendly and then I could go\n\n348\n00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:15.030\ncreate another quota and then come\nback here to this page and select it.\n\n349\n00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:18.100\nBut no, I would lose this work so,\n\n350\n00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:22.510\nforget it I just gonna click okay and\nsee what happens.\n\n351\n00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.990\nMaybe a cycle actually\nhappened that would be ideal.\n\n352\n00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.610\n>> Yeah.\n\n353\n00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:30.490\nthat's really good.\n\n354\n00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.240\n>> At this point we're getting\nabsolutely no feedback\n\n355\n00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.435\n>> But the OK button has been depressed.\n\n356\n00:21:37.435 --> 00:21:40.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now don't be confused by this\n\n357\n00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.810\nred text here saying no\nexact matches found.\n\n358\n00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:48.510\nI fixed that, and I know I have fixed it\nbecause my username there is underlined.\n\n359\n00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:54.850\nLet's check on Task Manager just for\nkicks See whats going on there, and\n\n360\n00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:56.710\nas expected CPU is very high.\n\n361\n00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:01.280\nYou can see there Sequel Server process\n\n362\n00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:08.310\nand also the IS Worker Process\nare both very busy.\n\n363\n00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.620\nAnd we've got approximately one and\n\n364\n00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.710\na half gigabytes of REM allocated\nto Sequel Server right now.\n\n365\n00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:18.200\nSo this just goes to show\nhow resource intensive.\n\n366\n00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:23.990\nSharePoint is in terms of SQL impact,\nthat's why we preach the benefit of\n\n367\n00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:29.670\nseparate physical machine for SQL,\npossibly mirrored SQL in the back end.\n\n368\n00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:32.880\nBecause there's a lot\nof IO to the database,\n\n369\n00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.360\nand it also underscores\nthe benefit of at least gigabit,\n\n370\n00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.930\npreferably ten gigabit\nethernet in your environment.\n\n371\n00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.230\nYeah, especially, if you get, I know\nwe're doing it all on a single server for\n\n372\n00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:48.750\nthe demo, but you take two resource\nintensive products like SharePoint and\n\n373\n00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:52.440\nSQL, you put them on the same machine,\nand you're bound to run into some issues.\n\n374\n00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.740\n>> Indeed.\n\n375\n00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:54.616\n>> Which we have.\n\n376\n00:22:54.616 --> 00:22:55.426\n[LAUGH]\n>> Ha!\n\n377\n00:22:55.426 --> 00:22:56.830\nThat's right.\n\n378\n00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.890\nOK, this is interesting, because now it\nsays 'create new web application' but\n\n379\n00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.930\nactually I'm creating\na new site collection.\n\n380\n00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.890\nAlthough I did click on the link\n\n381\n00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:09.650\nright on the end of the 'create\nnew application' dialogue box.\n\n382\n00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:12.000\n>> So the wizard it still open\nin the background somewhere.\n\n383\n00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.060\n>> Yeah, I don't code the software!\n\n384\n00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.100\nNor does Mike!\n\n385\n00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.065\nThis is not the way I would do it.\n\n386\n00:23:19.065 --> 00:23:20.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But anyway,\n\n387\n00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.930\nwe'll just wait for\nthat process to complete.\n\n388\n00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:29.080\nOkay, excellent, so\nyeah well actually in fairness the,\n\n389\n00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.470\nthe, new web app was still in\nthe process of being created.\n\n390\n00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:37.130\nWe could Create a site collection\nin the root of the web app at\n\n391\n00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.750\nthe time of web app\ncreation like we just did.\n\n392\n00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:42.960\nOr I could have chosen to,\nyou know what I'm going for\n\n393\n00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.270\nsoda, I'll create the root\nsite collection later.\n\n394\n00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:52.306\nSo we did both there, and\nthen here's a helpful link.\n\n395\n00:23:52.306 --> 00:23:54.620\nSo I could click on that URL if I want.\n\n396\n00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.849\nLet's do that just for a lark.\n\n397\n00:23:56.849 --> 00:24:00.137\nSee what happens, and as expected,\nit's opening in another window.\n\n398\n00:24:00.137 --> 00:24:03.750\nI'll come back to the original tab and\nclick OK.\n\n399\n00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.740\nAnd then it should refresh and\n\n400\n00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.810\nshow our new web application in a list,\nand it does.\n\n401\n00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:13.712\nSo that's right,\nthere's the SharePoint demo,\n\n402\n00:24:13.712 --> 00:24:17.360\nand the URL path, and it's loading.\n\n403\n00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.550\nIt'll take a while, just like we\ntalked about in another episode,\n\n404\n00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:25.010\nthe importance of, if you have a site\ncollection that's likely to be visited,\n\n405\n00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:26.580\nnow it's asking for credentials.\n\n406\n00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:31.520\nBut, you'd wanna run a script to ping the,\nor hit the site early in the day before\n\n407\n00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.270\nyour first employee comes, and\nthen when the first employee comes,\n\n408\n00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:37.390\nthat site is cached,\nthey don't have to wait a couple minutes.\n\n409\n00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:38.530\nNow it's asking for credentials.\n\n410\n00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:41.010\nSometimes, you get annoyingly\nrepeatedly asked for\n\n411\n00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.440\ncredentials in a SharePoint environment.\n\n412\n00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.170\nYou should only get asked once, if at all.\n\n413\n00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:49.860\nThat depends on some internet\noption settings you can tweak.\n\n414\n00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.300\nAll right.\nSo there is, again,\n\n415\n00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:57.150\nback in my list of web applications.\n\n416\n00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.670\nWhile we're waiting for\nthe other site to load.\n\n417\n00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:02.050\nI can see it's still loading because\nthe circle is going around in the tab.\n\n418\n00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:04.080\nNotice there's a delete option here.\n\n419\n00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:09.070\nI can either delete the web app, and\n\n420\n00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:13.690\nalso optionally delete all the IS content\nassociated with extending the web app.\n\n421\n00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.650\nSo a caveat here I've mentioned before,\nI'll mention it again.\n\n422\n00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:20.150\nWhatever you can do in terms of\nadministration from central admin,\n\n423\n00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.030\ndo it there.\n\n424\n00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:25.756\nDon't think I am an IAS expert, I'll\njust do whatever I needed to do in IAS.\n\n425\n00:25:25.756 --> 00:25:29.430\nNo, that's a bad move because then you\nmight come back to central admin site and\n\n426\n00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.750\nmake some changes that overwrite or\n\n427\n00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:36.285\nmaybe conflict with settings you\nestablished by tweaking IAS setting.\n\n428\n00:25:36.285 --> 00:25:39.710\nSome activities you must do in IAS,\nlike certificate settings for\n\n429\n00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:43.110\nexample, but\nwhatever you can do in SharePoint admin or\n\n430\n00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:47.720\nvia PowerShell, you should do it\nthat way and use IAS sparingly.\n\n431\n00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.970\nOkay, so this is a good time to wrap up,\nwhile we're waiting for\n\n432\n00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.220\nthis site collection to load.\n\n433\n00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:59.750\nAnd then we'll talk about site collection\nsettings in an upcoming episode.\n\n434\n00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.750\n>> All right, so in all fairness,\nwe do sometimes give it a,\n\n435\n00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:05.990\nwe start complaining a little bit but\nit's really doing a lot, right?\n\n436\n00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:07.650\nIt's creating the web application,\n\n437\n00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:11.530\nit's creating the site collection,\nit's creating all the resources for that.\n\n438\n00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:15.210\nIt's creating the database and\nSQL and all the entries.\n\n439\n00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:19.930\nSo we really shouldn't get too frustrated\nor we need to be a little more patient,\n\n440\n00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:20.780\nI don't know, sometimes.\n\n441\n00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:24.878\nIt seems like the faster computers get the\nless patient I am with them sometimes, but\n\n442\n00:26:24.878 --> 00:26:25.810\na little patience.\n\n443\n00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:29.700\nAnyway, we are going to, we're out of\nour time for this particular episode so\n\n444\n00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.760\nwe will come back and\ncheck on the completion of that.\n\n445\n00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.440\nBut we got to see the main portion of\nthe creation of the web application and\n\n446\n00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.130\nthe creation of the site collection.\n\n447\n00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.900\nWhen we come back in our next part we'll\nshow you the results of the that creation.\n\n448\n00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.320\nSo signing off for now.\n\n449\n00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.071\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n450\n00:26:44.071 --> 00:26:44.884\n>> And I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n451\n00:26:44.884 --> 00:26:47.682\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n452\n00:26:47.682 --> 00:26:54.846\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.770\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.923\nToday we're doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:20.923 --> 00:00:22.397\nAnd specifically, in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:25.300\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\nconfiguring our site collections.\n\n7\n00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.220\nIn a previous episode,\n\n8\n00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.050\nwe saw how to create our web application,\ncreate our root site collection.\n\n9\n00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.460\nNow we wanna go back and\nmake sure it's finished,\n\n10\n00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.290\ncompleted and\nto configure that site collection.\n\n11\n00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.816\nAnd here to help us with that of course,\nis Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n12\n00:00:38.816 --> 00:00:39.559\nHow you doing, Mark?\n\n13\n00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.460\n>> Great Mike, thanks very much.\n\n14\n00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.570\nSo, since last we met, the site\n\n15\n00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.550\ncollection has finished creating in the\nroot of the web application we created.\n\n16\n00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.802\nSo if we go up to the URL path here,\nwe can see our server name, colon 1111.\n\n17\n00:00:55.802 --> 00:00:58.930\nThat's the port number I selected.\n\n18\n00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.520\nAnd great, so\nnow we have a generic SharePoint site.\n\n19\n00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.710\nLots to talk about here.\n\n20\n00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.960\nNotice how Microsoft's been more\nconversational in the last few years,\n\n21\n00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.550\nso it's pretty quiet here.\n\n22\n00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.870\nInvite more people to the site or\nstart a conversation, kind of hip.\n\n23\n00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.383\nIf you're on Windows 10, for example, and\n\n24\n00:01:19.383 --> 00:01:23.072\nyour browser is not connected,\nthe web is not the same without you.\n\n25\n00:01:23.072 --> 00:01:26.160\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, their blue screen has even gotten\n\n26\n00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.510\na little friendlier with\na little frowny face on it.\n\n27\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.830\nThey are trying to keep with the times.\n\n28\n00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.340\n>> Right that is a good point.\n\n29\n00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.910\nIt a white screen.\n\n30\n00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.490\nOkay.\n\n31\n00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.070\nSo, if you wondering about\nthe configuration of settings and\n\n32\n00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.180\noptions, keep in mind that\nMicrosoft is optimizing for Touch.\n\n33\n00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.920\nMany of us are using hybrid machines.\n\n34\n00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.410\nIt's nice to have the space\nbetween options so\n\n35\n00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.120\nthat we can get our little fingers in\nthere and select the right option.\n\n36\n00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.650\nSometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\n\n37\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.230\nLots to talk about.\n\n38\n00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.130\nIn the upper left corner, here,\nwe've got the S, I'm hovering over it,\n\n39\n00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.210\nit says Demo Site.\n\n40\n00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.910\nThat is a good link to get back home,\nin other words,\n\n41\n00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.450\nto this very page from wherever\nI may navigate in the site.\n\n42\n00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.310\nYou could replace that, of course,\nwith your company logo.\n\n43\n00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.140\nEverything is replaceable,\neven us, in your SharePoint site.\n\n44\n00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.298\nI mean a site template is a suggested\narrangement, essentially,\n\n45\n00:02:22.298 --> 00:02:28.770\nof how to configure in this case, a\nfunctional team site, but you can adjust.\n\n46\n00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.580\nOver the left here,\nwe have our quick launch section.\n\n47\n00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.630\nHome, and I click on Documents.\n\n48\n00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.010\nIt'll load up, and you can see, it says\nworking on it, briefly, and the tab there,\n\n49\n00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.813\nand here is our link to\na documents library.\n\n50\n00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.189\nI have a Site Contents link also,\nin the quick launch.\n\n51\n00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.630\nSo it will be a little a adjustment\nto make the if you were working\n\n52\n00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.670\nwith SharePoint 2010 currently,\nfor example,\n\n53\n00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.480\nthen these icons may be a little\nconfusing, a little unfamiliar.\n\n54\n00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.136\nI can add an app.\n\n55\n00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:01.769\nI click on that.\n\n56\n00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.457\nSo I can add functionality,\nlike a Forms Library,\n\n57\n00:03:09.457 --> 00:03:15.430\nmaybe a little Announcement section,\na Discussion Board, Custom List.\n\n58\n00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.160\nSo it's good to peruse these options.\n\n59\n00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.960\nYou are not gonna add all of them at once,\nor on any given site.\n\n60\n00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.560\nIn fact, in your whole deployment,\n\n61\n00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.790\nyou might only use some of\nthe functionality of SharePoint.\n\n62\n00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.690\nThere's a survey, an issue tracking app.\n\n63\n00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.415\nIf I click on the arrow here,\nI've got an asset library app.\n\n64\n00:03:33.415 --> 00:03:36.910\nI can import a spreadsheet,\nset up a report library.\n\n65\n00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.820\nWhen we talk libraries in SharePoint,\nthat means it's optimized for\n\n66\n00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.110\nstorage of certain kinds of content.\n\n67\n00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.590\nIt's not like we can not store\npictures in a document library.\n\n68\n00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.540\nIt's just that the meta data columns,\nand the site columns,\n\n69\n00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.870\nthe way we can classify data, are\noptimized for a certain kind of content.\n\n70\n00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.150\nSo if I went to a picture library,\nfor example,\n\n71\n00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.790\nthat would be optimized to store pictures.\n\n72\n00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.380\nIt would have columns pertaining to focal\nlength, the date picture was taken, etc.\n\n73\n00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.280\nSo just something to keep in mind there.\n\n74\n00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.820\nNow, I'll go back.\n\n75\n00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.820\nThe recycle bin we talked\nabout in another episode,\n\n76\n00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.330\nhow we have a two stage recycle bin now.\n\n77\n00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.180\nSo I have a recycle bin at\na site I might create, and\n\n78\n00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.120\nalso my site collection administrator\nhas the second stage recycle bin.\n\n79\n00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.770\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n80\n00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.640\nNow in case I forgot who I was,\n\n81\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.450\nI am actually the Site Collection Admin,\nit says.\n\n82\n00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.540\nWhoo!\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n83\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.830\n>> Which means I can see deleted\n\n84\n00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.730\nitems from all sites in\nthis site collection,\n\n85\n00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.840\nwhich could be potentially\nthousands of sites.\n\n86\n00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.570\nI can click a link there to learn more.\n\n87\n00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.562\nAnd here's where I can\nempty the Recycle Bin.\n\n88\n00:04:44.562 --> 00:04:47.880\nIf I can't find what I'm looking for,\nthere's a link, here, for the second stage\n\n89\n00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.070\nrecycle bin, which goes to the very\ntop level and, as it says here,\n\n90\n00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.000\nI can see all items deleted from\nanywhere in the site collection.\n\n91\n00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.150\nFirst stage Recycle Bin in the default, is\nto keep it in the recycle bin for 30 days.\n\n92\n00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.050\nBeyond that, it goes to the site\ncollection Recycle Bin, and\n\n93\n00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.590\na maximum of 50% more than\nthe site collection quota\n\n94\n00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.080\nworth of material will be saved\nin the second stage Recycle Bin.\n\n95\n00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.210\nIf some new content hits the second stage\nrecycle bin which will push over quota, or\n\n96\n00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.610\nover the 50% of the quota,\nthen the oldest item gets deleted.\n\n97\n00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.340\nWhich means you're going to have to\nrestore from a back up if you want access\n\n98\n00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.220\nto that content.\n\n99\n00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.730\nAll right.\n\n100\n00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.370\nNow, there's an edit link as well.\n\n101\n00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:39.120\nAnd I can either drag and drop a link or I\ncan click on the plus sign next to a link.\n\n102\n00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.070\nSo I might want, now,\nI've been speiling on various episodes,\n\n103\n00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.520\nyou've heard me talk about the importance\nof decluttering, eliminating old data.\n\n104\n00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.180\nSo I'm not just going to add a link for\nthe sake of adding a link.\n\n105\n00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.015\nWell, who am I kidding?\n\n106\n00:05:51.015 --> 00:05:51.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sure I am.\n\n107\n00:05:52.595 --> 00:05:56.790\n[LAUGH] I just changed\nmy mind on the spot.\n\n108\n00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.720\nI can always delete the link later.\n\n109\n00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.358\nLet's see if we can get out to MSN.com.\n\n110\n00:06:01.358 --> 00:06:05.300\nNow there's helpfully, a try link, link so\n\n111\n00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.380\nif I fat fingered it in any way,\nI can observe that.\n\n112\n00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.260\nOkay, so\n\n113\n00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.000\nprobably some horrific headlines, let's\ndelete before we actually look at that.\n\n114\n00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.345\nLook away, look away, save yourself first.\n\n115\n00:06:16.345 --> 00:06:18.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So now I click on okay.\n\n116\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.550\nVoila.\n\n117\n00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.340\nThere's my MSN link.\n\n118\n00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.880\nBut, it looks like I can click on Save.\n\n119\n00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:32.170\nAnd now MSN is located, alphabetically,\nin the quick link section.\n\n120\n00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.260\nBut I don't really want\nthat there anymore so\n\n121\n00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.670\nI'll just delete the link I just created.\n\n122\n00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.160\nOkay, so that's how you create and\ndelete a link.\n\n123\n00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.590\nNow, let's go back home.\n\n124\n00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.201\nThere is a home link, or\nI could click on the S,\n\n125\n00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:50.970\nSuperman, super SharePoint logo.\n\n126\n00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.350\nAll right, now let's go to settings.\n\n127\n00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.700\nI can edit the page.\n\n128\n00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.240\nWe can edit almost anything\nin a SharePoint context.\n\n129\n00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:06.270\nNow, You can see here,\nwe have various zones.\n\n130\n00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.080\nSo we have some links here.\n\n131\n00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.918\nI can remove this whole section.\n\n132\n00:07:10.918 --> 00:07:12.840\nThese tiles.\n\n133\n00:07:15.707 --> 00:07:19.400\nAnother option is to remove\nthis little document section.\n\n134\n00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.410\nNotice when I'm hovering my mouse over\nthe document section in the lower right,\n\n135\n00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.140\nthere, in the upper right\nhand part of the box,\n\n136\n00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.090\nthere's a little checkbox there and\na drop down arrow that appears.\n\n137\n00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.470\nAnd here's where I can\neither delete the web part,\n\n138\n00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.170\nremember I can always add it in later if\nI need to, or I can edit the web part.\n\n139\n00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.150\nLet's click on edit web part.\n\n140\n00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:45.960\nAll right, so\n\n141\n00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.490\nthis would be covered extensively\nin a SharePoint designer course.\n\n142\n00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.285\nI'm just showing you what you can do\njust so you'll know that it can be done.\n\n143\n00:07:56.285 --> 00:07:59.187\nI can change things like\nthe layout of the web part.\n\n144\n00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.579\nWhere the web part appears.\n\n145\n00:08:01.579 --> 00:08:05.040\nIn other words,\nwhich zone on the screen there.\n\n146\n00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.440\nNot to be confused with the zones we were\ntalking about in another episode with\n\n147\n00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.760\nalternate access mappings.\n\n148\n00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.190\nThat's different ways of accessing\nthe same contact, content rather.\n\n149\n00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:19.050\nThis zone referred to in this menu option\nrefers to where on this single page,\n\n150\n00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.610\nwhere on this screen\nthe web part will appear.\n\n151\n00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.180\nLet's see here.\n\n152\n00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.220\nAJAX Options for refreshing.\n\n153\n00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.610\nMiscellaneous options,\nin terms of caching.\n\n154\n00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.620\nThere's an Appearance section here.\n\n155\n00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:39.360\nSo I could make the web part\na fixed height and or width.\n\n156\n00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.660\nOr let Windows automatically adjust\n\n157\n00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.050\nthe dimensions of the web\npart to fit the zone.\n\n158\n00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:48.880\nAnd depending on how many other web\nparts need to fit into that zone.\n\n159\n00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.230\nSo I can in other words hard code\nthe sizing or let Windows decide, or\n\n160\n00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.980\nSharePoint rather, decide.\n\n161\n00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.850\nOkay, so\nI will not worry about that right now.\n\n162\n00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:05.320\nLet's go to the insert tab here so\nI could add additional content.\n\n163\n00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.790\nThere is a files, actually we'll\nget into that more a little later.\n\n164\n00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.570\nSo, let's get out of\nthe editing option here for\n\n165\n00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:18.820\nthe page to show you that\nevery page is editable.\n\n166\n00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:26.360\nAnd there's also an edit button on, or\nedit link which gets me to the same place.\n\n167\n00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.710\nSo like many things Windows, different\nways to accomplish the exact same task or\n\n168\n00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.100\nget to the same place.\n\n169\n00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.180\nI'll go back to my gear icon.\n\n170\n00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.562\nI can add a page to my site if I want.\n\n171\n00:09:37.562 --> 00:09:41.602\nAnd give the page a name,\nlet's see what that looks like.\n\n172\n00:09:41.602 --> 00:09:45.510\nI'll call this demo 2, son of demo.\n\n173\n00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.720\nNotice how the url changes, I don't\nknow if you can see that on your screen,\n\n174\n00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.860\nhopefully you can.\n\n175\n00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:58.370\nSo we have under site pages now\n/ demo there's a percent 20.\n\n176\n00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:04.470\nPercent 20 is a kind of expensive way, in\nterms of characters, of denoting a space.\n\n177\n00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.250\nSo let's see what happens if I.\n\n178\n00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.915\nIdeally, you were going to snug up and\neliminate spaces.\n\n179\n00:10:10.915 --> 00:10:12.000\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n180\n00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.860\n>> In our naming conventions.\n\n181\n00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.430\nSo notice,\nwhen I remove the space in the page\n\n182\n00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:21.098\nname from demo space two to demo two,\nall snugged up.\n\n183\n00:10:21.098 --> 00:10:26.080\nThat the %20 has been eliminated\nfrom the URL at the bottom.\n\n184\n00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.580\nSo that's, you know it may not seem like\na big deal, but in terms of a navigability\n\n185\n00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:36.560\nand ease of access and visualizing and\nseeing what the URL is,\n\n186\n00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.210\nand also the URL length, which may be\na concern if you have a lot of sub-sites.\n\n187\n00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.480\nAnd subdirectories,\nit's good to conserve characters.\n\n188\n00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:49.520\nSo I'll call it demo2 with no space and\nclick on Create.\n\n189\n00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:55.118\nAnd that didn't take long at all,\nand here's my very basic page.\n\n190\n00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.270\nWhoops, so\nI'll just type in some content here.\n\n191\n00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:02.545\nDemo2 is alive and well.\n\n192\n00:11:02.545 --> 00:11:04.480\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n193\n00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.730\n>> And living in Las Vegas.\n\n194\n00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.340\nAnd then I can click on\nthe save button here.\n\n195\n00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.680\nI can save and keep editing.\n\n196\n00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.120\nI just click on save.\n\n197\n00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:19.370\nAnd there's the content I just typed in,\nDemo2 is alive and well, in my Demo2 page.\n\n198\n00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:19.870\n>> Nice.\n\n199\n00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.510\n>> I'll click on my home button and\n\n200\n00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:29.930\nlet's go back into,\nlet's check out site content here.\n\n201\n00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.020\nSo this is what's currently in my site.\n\n202\n00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.570\nHere I can click on it,\ncreate a new subsite.\n\n203\n00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.040\nLittle button at the bottom there.\n\n204\n00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.374\nSo let's do that,\nI'll call this demo subsite.\n\n205\n00:11:43.374 --> 00:11:44.858\nActually, let's snug that up.\n\n206\n00:11:46.835 --> 00:11:49.201\nAnd I need to give it a URL name.\n\n207\n00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:50.456\nI'll call it demosubsite.\n\n208\n00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.100\nAnd I have some enterprise\noptions here for sites.\n\n209\n00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.740\nWe'll get into that more later.\n\n210\n00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:08.590\nSome advanced or enterprise type\nfunctionality, in terms of site templates.\n\n211\n00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:09.990\nBut let's just keep it simple.\n\n212\n00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.030\nAnd now,\nhere's something you need to decide.\n\n213\n00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.946\nThe default is, if you think of\ncreating an NTFS permissions,\n\n214\n00:12:14.946 --> 00:12:18.313\nif you create a folder, or a sub\nfolder hierarchy, what is the default?\n\n215\n00:12:18.313 --> 00:12:21.911\nThe default is to inherit\nthe permissions of the parent object.\n\n216\n00:12:21.911 --> 00:12:26.273\nYou can create an exception and break\ninheritance from the parent object but\n\n217\n00:12:26.273 --> 00:12:29.600\nthere should be a compelling\nreason to do so.\n\n218\n00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.950\nSo I could either say the default is to\nuse the same permissions as the parent\n\n219\n00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.200\nsite or\nI could click on use unique permissions.\n\n220\n00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.790\nI'll keep it at the default,\nuse same permissions.\n\n221\n00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:43.670\nNow, in terms of having a clean interface,\ndo I want to have this site\n\n222\n00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:48.480\nI'm about to create available on\nthe quick launch of the parent site.\n\n223\n00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.490\nYou might think, well why not?\n\n224\n00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.620\nWell, it can clutter up the parent site.\n\n225\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.490\nAlso, it helps you know where you are,\n\n226\n00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:03.530\nhaving distinct quick launch links on\na sub site versus the parent site.\n\n227\n00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:08.425\nSo you may not want to standardize all\nthe quick launch links on every site and\n\n228\n00:13:08.425 --> 00:13:09.700\nsub-site.\n\n229\n00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.080\nAdditionally, do you wanna\nuse the top link bar,\n\n230\n00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.770\nthat's across the top there, top link\nbar for the current site, yes or no.\n\n231\n00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:19.640\nAgain it's easier to know you're in\na sub-site if you don't see the same\n\n232\n00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.724\ntop link bar on child sites or sub-sites.\n\n233\n00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.620\nI will choose to keep the default\nof displaying the site on the top\n\n234\n00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.860\nlink bar of the parent site.\n\n235\n00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:33.500\nIn other words from the parent\nsite I can link to the sub-site.\n\n236\n00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.450\nLet's see what that looks like.\n\n237\n00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.300\nAnd feel free to experiment, you can\nalways change these settings later.\n\n238\n00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.980\nI'll show you how to do\nsome of that as we go.\n\n239\n00:13:46.113 --> 00:13:47.690\nWorking on it it says.\n\n240\n00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.065\nThere no little circle anymore,\nit just says working on it.\n\n241\n00:13:50.065 --> 00:13:52.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay,\n\n242\n00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.030\nthe screen is refreshing, excellent.\n\n243\n00:13:55.050 --> 00:14:00.330\nSo now I'm in my DemoSubsite which\nlooks pretty familiar, because it's\n\n244\n00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.639\nalso a team site like the parent site,\nI just created the DemoSubsite underneath.\n\n245\n00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:10.300\nSo what happens if I\nclick on the home button?\n\n246\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.702\nWell that's interesting,\nI'm still on my demo sub-site.\n\n247\n00:14:15.303 --> 00:14:18.622\nOkay that's less than ideal, so\n\n248\n00:14:18.622 --> 00:14:25.080\nI'll use my back button to\nget to my original home-site.\n\n249\n00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:25.760\nWhich was right there.\n\n250\n00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.630\nOkay so then but\n\n251\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:33.360\nnotice now back at the home site I can\nclick directly to the demo sub site.\n\n252\n00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.290\nWhy?\nBecause when I created them a sub site I\n\n253\n00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:40.790\nchose to put that link on the top\nlink bar of the parent site.\n\n254\n00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.080\nSo that's a good idea.\n\n255\n00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.470\nOkay what else do we\nwanna talk about here.\n\n256\n00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:47.510\nChange the look.\n\n257\n00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.770\nFreshen up the look.\n\n258\n00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:52.270\n>> Always good.\n\n259\n00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.770\n>> Well it can be,\nit can also be a confusing mess.\n\n260\n00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:00.050\nSo we've got various looks here.\n\n261\n00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.300\nHere's sea monster.\n\n262\n00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.110\nThat's good if you sell sushi.\n\n263\n00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.670\n[LAUGH] Or seaweed or something.\n\n264\n00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.310\nAnd then there's Sushi\ningredients in other words.\n\n265\n00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:15.820\nWe've got various looks here,\nlime, nature, some of these\n\n266\n00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:20.770\nto me look rather extreme, but to you\nthey might fit right in your wheelhouse.\n\n267\n00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.670\nThese are just some options\nhere to change the look.\n\n268\n00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.500\nLet's see what happens.\n\n269\n00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.700\nLet's go to sea monster.\n\n270\n00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.170\n>> I like it.\n>> We can always go back.\n\n271\n00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.930\nOoh, interesting.\n\n272\n00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.555\nSo that's sea monster.\n\n273\n00:15:34.555 --> 00:15:37.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm going back.\n\n274\n00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:38.625\nCall me traditional.\n\n275\n00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:39.312\n>> [LAUGH] Okay, traditional.\n\n276\n00:15:39.312 --> 00:15:42.820\n>> [LAUGH] But just not late for dinner.\n\n277\n00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.210\nI'm keeping with the, okay, there we go.\n\n278\n00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.730\nThis is demo site again.\n\n279\n00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:47.945\nNow.\n>> It is nice that they give us some pre\n\n280\n00:15:47.945 --> 00:15:51.862\nbuilt themes like that where, you know,\nI might not be a web designer.\n\n281\n00:15:51.862 --> 00:15:53.679\nI'm not the most creative person but\n\n282\n00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:56.930\nI don't want it to look like\na default SharePoint site.\n\n283\n00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.515\nOr I want something different,\nlike our demo site and\n\n284\n00:15:59.515 --> 00:16:01.419\nour demo subsite are exactly the same.\n\n285\n00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:05.100\nSo really just to\ndifferentiate between the two.\n\n286\n00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.710\nThere's quick little themes\nyou can throw out there.\n\n287\n00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:11.640\nYou don't have to be a graphics designer,\nwhich you certainly can, but you can just\n\n288\n00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.040\ngrab one of those real quick and instantly\nhave it look different from the default.\n\n289\n00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.640\n>> Excellent point.\n\n290\n00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.450\nLet's go back up.\n\n291\n00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.769\nI'm on my gear icon here, and\nnow I'll click on site settings.\n\n292\n00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.130\nAll right,\nhere's a variety of site settings here.\n\n293\n00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:33.320\nSo the way these are organized\nis not the best frankly.\n\n294\n00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:40.510\nFor example, the general categories like\nusers and permission, site administration,\n\n295\n00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:45.365\nlook and feel I'm not sure how this order\ncame to be, they're not alphabetical.\n\n296\n00:16:45.365 --> 00:16:47.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> they're not really necessarily in\n\n297\n00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:51.370\nthe order you configure these\nsettings either, similarity,\n\n298\n00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:57.220\nunderneath the different section headers,\nfor example look and\n\n299\n00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:01.690\nfeel\n>> These may actually have something to do\n\n300\n00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:05.230\nwith the order in which you'd normally\nconfigure them, but many of the options\n\n301\n00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:10.100\nunderneath section headers are neither\nalphabetical nor in a chronological order.\n\n302\n00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:14.230\nIn which you normally configure these\nsettings, so it's a little confusing.\n\n303\n00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.090\nYou could always use Ctrl+F and\n\n304\n00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:21.000\nsearch for a word on the page If you're\nnot sure where a certain setting is.\n\n305\n00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:28.310\nAlso important to remember is to\nchange settings at the right level.\n\n306\n00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.500\nAt the bottom of the page,\n\n307\n00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:36.290\nI have Site Collection Administration\nsettings like Recycle Bin, Site hierarchy.\n\n308\n00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:42.080\nBut if I scroll right above that there\nare site administration settings.\n\n309\n00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.980\nOnly at the root site collection or\nthe root site at the top of\n\n310\n00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:50.650\nthe site collection hierarchy would I see\nsite collection administration settings.\n\n311\n00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.780\nSo if I see these site administration\nsettings I know that I'm at the top\n\n312\n00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.890\nof the hierarchy.\n\n313\n00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:59.760\nOtherwise further down, I would only\nsee site administration settings, and\n\n314\n00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.510\nsome other combination of these\nother settings like users and\n\n315\n00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.600\npermissions look and feel inside actions.\n\n316\n00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:09.990\nSo since we are at the top level site,\nlet's look at\n\n317\n00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:14.970\nsome of these site collection\nadministration settings like features.\n\n318\n00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:18.749\nSo we've already in other episodes\nlooked at farm level features.\n\n319\n00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.370\nLet's look at some site\ncollection features.\n\n320\n00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:30.880\nOkay, so here's for\nexample a content type,\n\n321\n00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.720\ncontent deployment source feature So,\ncontent deployment.\n\n322\n00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.360\nWe can move content\nbetween SharePoint farms.\n\n323\n00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.609\nIf we have a publishing farm,\nfor example, editing environment,\n\n324\n00:18:46.609 --> 00:18:50.560\nstaging, test environment and\nthen production.\n\n325\n00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:54.184\nWe're not going to cover all these\nfeatures, just to point out they exist.\n\n326\n00:18:54.184 --> 00:18:58.906\n>> And some of the features that\nare available to configure at the site\n\n327\n00:18:58.906 --> 00:19:00.350\ncollection level.\n\n328\n00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:05.692\nLet's see here, in-place records\nmanagement, typically for records\n\n329\n00:19:05.692 --> 00:19:11.652\nwe'd have a separate record center,\na special site template to manage records.\n\n330\n00:19:11.652 --> 00:19:14.264\nBut we could manage\nrecords in place as well.\n\n331\n00:19:14.264 --> 00:19:19.440\nWe've got a reporting feature\nat the site collection level and\n\n332\n00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.980\nthen a variety of work flows.\n\n333\n00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.470\nIt says 2007, Share Point 2007 work flows.\n\n334\n00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:25.370\nDon't freak out.\n\n335\n00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:27.840\nThey're still usable in 2016 or\nthey wouldn't be here.\n\n336\n00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.630\nHere's a new one, video enriched media.\n\n337\n00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:37.010\nSo, this is functionality relating\nto managing and displaying\n\n338\n00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:42.150\nthings like video files,\nsound clips, images, work flows.\n\n339\n00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.610\nI like this one I'm gonna activate this\nbecause I'll be showing you some of\n\n340\n00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:51.840\nthe basic built in work\nflows in a later session.\n\n341\n00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.820\nSo now we can see that that's active.\n\n342\n00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.390\nThat's beautiful.\n\n343\n00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:56.680\nAlso publishing infrastructure.\n\n344\n00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.820\nThat's usually demolator.\n\n345\n00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.010\nI can activate this.\n\n346\n00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.960\nRemember, there's certain features\nthat you have to activate at the site\n\n347\n00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.620\ncollection level first and\nat the site level later.\n\n348\n00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:10.890\nThis is the poster child for that example.\n\n349\n00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.330\nLet's start with a good metaphor.\n\n350\n00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:14.825\nIt's late in the day.\n\n351\n00:20:14.825 --> 00:20:17.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's still, the circle is going there.\n\n352\n00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:21.260\nSo when I enable the SharePoint server\npublishing infrastructure at the site\n\n353\n00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.990\ncollection level, that will allow me to\nenable the feature at the site level,\n\n354\n00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:32.600\nlower down things like libraries,\npage layouts for publishing.\n\n355\n00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.240\nDifferent combinations of columns and\nimages, and\n\n356\n00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.060\nwhether the image is embedded\nin the columns, etc.\n\n357\n00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:44.800\nSo we're just making functionality\navailable by activating features.\n\n358\n00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.339\nSo we'll just let that run.\n\n359\n00:20:50.486 --> 00:20:53.330\nI encourage you, when you're in\nthe interface, just to scroll down.\n\n360\n00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:56.380\nEven though you're not going\nto be using all the features,\n\n361\n00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.610\nit's good to know what features exist.\n\n362\n00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:02.030\nEspecially, if you're looking for\na setting that you're familiar with using,\n\n363\n00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.960\nand it doesn't appear in\na particular environment.\n\n364\n00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.530\nOr a certain site or site collection\nprobably because that feature is not\n\n365\n00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:12.860\nactivated, or perhaps you don't have as\nmany permissions in that site collection\n\n366\n00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.050\nas you did in a different site collection.\n\n367\n00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:16.950\nSo you're not seeing that functionality or\n\n368\n00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.540\nmenu drop down option that\nyou're used to seeing.\n\n369\n00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.740\nOkay, that worked.\n\n370\n00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:23.630\nExcellent.\n\n371\n00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.690\nWas there any doubt?\n\n372\n00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.020\nNo.\n\n373\n00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:28.530\n>> Never.\n>> Good answer.\n\n374\n00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:33.510\nI'll go back now to my\nsite collection settings.\n\n375\n00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:42.520\nSite hierarchy here, I'll click on that.\n\n376\n00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:45.270\nThat's the entire Hierarchy at this point.\n\n377\n00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.560\n>> Not a very complex one just yet.\n\n378\n00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.200\n>> No.\nI have one demo subsite\n\n379\n00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.630\nwithin the Hierarchy.\n\n380\n00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.460\nBut, is there one place\nto go to check that out?\n\n381\n00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.520\n>> That can be very helpful\nin a complex environment.\n\n382\n00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.150\nOr especially, where you've got\nusers that could create sites.\n\n383\n00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.550\nYou don't know, maybe, or haven't\npaid attention to who's created what.\n\n384\n00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:02.970\nI need to get an overview.\n\n385\n00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.570\nAnd that's a great place to look.\n\n386\n00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:05.690\n>> Indeed.\n\n387\n00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:07.080\nNavigation is important,\n\n388\n00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.810\nespecially if you have a lot of\nsub-sites in your site collection.\n\n389\n00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:14.150\nAnd I can, the default is to\nenable security trimmings.\n\n390\n00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.350\nThis means that if I don't have\npermissions to do an action on a menu\n\n391\n00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:20.582\nitem, I won't see that menu option,\nso that's good.\n\n392\n00:22:20.582 --> 00:22:22.750\nAudience targeting.\n\n393\n00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.810\nThis is not the same as security,\nbut it is handy.\n\n394\n00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.190\nSo let's say I have an internet page And\n\n395\n00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:33.470\nthere's a thousand users that\nwill view that intranet page.\n\n396\n00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.320\nRather than creating multiple\nversions of the same page,\n\n397\n00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.410\nI can use audience targeting\nto expose certain content.\n\n398\n00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:44.970\nFor example, news clips or\nKPIs to certain audience members.\n\n399\n00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:49.280\nFor example, only executives\nshould see this certain KPI.\n\n400\n00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.320\nWell, based on audience membership.\n\n401\n00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.590\nAnd I can define audience membership\non any mandated field like job title,\n\n402\n00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:00.530\ngeography, classification for example.\n\n403\n00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.020\nThen even though I am displaying or\n\n404\n00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:08.050\npeople are accessing the same intranet\npage, depending on the users and audience\n\n405\n00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:12.010\ntargeting we could have several versions\nof that page being viewed at once.\n\n406\n00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:17.380\nThere are certain web parts, viewable for\nsome users and invisible to other users.\n\n407\n00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:18.290\n>> Well, that's pretty cool.\n\n408\n00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.630\n>> So audience targeting is a nifty thing.\n\n409\n00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:21.130\n>> Yeah.\n\n410\n00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.180\n>> Go back here, and\nI also want to show you now.\n\n411\n00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.410\nLet's look at there's variation settings.\n\n412\n00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.400\nThat refers to translations.\n\n413\n00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.078\nIf you're in a multilingual environment.\n\n414\n00:23:38.412 --> 00:23:41.535\nAnd that's all I wanted to show you\non Site Collection Administration.\n\n415\n00:23:43.613 --> 00:23:49.460\nLet's take a look at\nsome other options here.\n\n416\n00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.680\nSo Users and Permissions.\n\n417\n00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.927\nLet's go under People and Groups.\n\n418\n00:23:57.522 --> 00:24:02.602\nOkay, so\nthese are members of the demo site And\n\n419\n00:24:02.602 --> 00:24:06.390\nI can click on New, and Add Users.\n\n420\n00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.880\nAnd then I can invite\ncertain people to the site.\n\n421\n00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:18.387\nShare it with, interesting,\nunexpected response to different server.\n\n422\n00:24:18.387 --> 00:24:20.065\nNo net ladies and gentlemen.\n\n423\n00:24:20.065 --> 00:24:20.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n424\n00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.440\nI can invite people to join or\nview the site.\n\n425\n00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.420\nAnd then actions as well.\n\n426\n00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:30.100\nWe looked at this in a different episode\nat the central admin site level,\n\n427\n00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:35.890\nsimilar settings here in\nterms of email all or\n\n428\n00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:38.499\nsome members of the group\nthat have access to the site.\n\n429\n00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.710\nAnd we have three general categories.\n\n430\n00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:46.340\nVisitors Members and owners in SharePoint.\n\n431\n00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.780\nVisitors typically get read only access,\n\n432\n00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:53.450\nmembers can upload modify\ntheir own content.\n\n433\n00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:58.140\nOwners have essentially full control\nover the content of a particular site.\n\n434\n00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:04.340\nSo I can click on and see visitors and\nowners if I have any people or\n\n435\n00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:09.180\nthere's me my currently login user name\nacme administrator I am a demo site owner.\n\n436\n00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.680\nWhy I just created a this site and\n\n437\n00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.420\nI specify myself as the primary\nsite collection admin.\n\n438\n00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.140\nThat's why I am the owner.\n\n439\n00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:23.750\nAll right under more here are a variety of\nother group types, which are relevant now.\n\n440\n00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:27.420\nBecause I enabled SharePoint\npublishing infrastructure,\n\n441\n00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:32.911\nthat is gonna give me some more\noptions here in terms of our groups.\n\n442\n00:25:32.911 --> 00:25:38.220\nSo approvers, for example, so approvers\ncan do things like approve pages,\n\n443\n00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.370\napprove documents for publishing.\n\n444\n00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:45.980\nDesigners, that lets me use\nthe SharePoint designer functionality,\n\n445\n00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.670\nchanging the look and\nfeel of a site collection or a site.\n\n446\n00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.820\nQuick deploy users, this is handy.\n\n447\n00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:55.520\nSo this also relates to publishing.\n\n448\n00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.850\nSo let's say we have\na normal approval workflow,\n\n449\n00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:04.100\nit has to go through three people before\na news item appears on, let's say, CNN.\n\n450\n00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:08.220\nBut let's say there's an emergency\nsituation where we don't have time to go\n\n451\n00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.580\nthrough, or we can't contact\nthe regular approval channels,\n\n452\n00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.240\nthis information needs\nto be published now.\n\n453\n00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.830\nWell if I'm part of\nthe quick deploy users group\n\n454\n00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:20.380\nI have that ability to\ninstantly deploy content.\n\n455\n00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.510\nOr it's called a quick deploy job.\n\n456\n00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.080\nOkay.\n\n457\n00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:36.220\nLet's go back into our Site Settings,\nokay.\n\n458\n00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:41.200\nAnd now, let's look at some of these\nsite features under site action.\n\n459\n00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.910\nSo, we've just looked at\nthe site collection features.\n\n460\n00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:47.040\nLet's look at site features now.\n\n461\n00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:51.640\nSo, we can see here, here's our BI center,\ndata connection features for\n\n462\n00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.579\nbusiness intelligence data we can surface.\n\n463\n00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.190\nLet's see what else do I\nwant to show you here.\n\n464\n00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:03.690\nOkay so within SharePoint we have\nthe ability to perform legal holds.\n\n465\n00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:07.550\nIn other words we have some paralegals or\nlawyers going through content and\n\n466\n00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:11.270\nflagging or\ntagging content with a legal hold.\n\n467\n00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.740\nThat means, let's say we have scheduled\nwith our data retention policy we\n\n468\n00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:18.810\nscheduled this particular\ndocument to be deleted.\n\n469\n00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:21.650\nWell if it was scheduled to be deleted,\nit would not be deleted for\n\n470\n00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:23.200\nthe duration of the legal hold.\n\n471\n00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.840\nThe courts would not look kindly on you\nif you went back to them saying well,\n\n472\n00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.490\nwe had that document but\nwe just deleted it.\n\n473\n00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:30.730\nSorry.\nThat would not look good.\n\n474\n00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:34.020\nSo you could actually have\nmultiple legal holds.\n\n475\n00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.300\nBut on the same document.\n\n476\n00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.070\nBecause the same document might be part of\ndifferent legal proceedings, they think.\n\n477\n00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:39.800\nBig companies like Microsoft, for example.\n\n478\n00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.120\nOther big firms.\n\n479\n00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.190\nAre always under some kind of litigation.\n\n480\n00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:44.120\nFrivolous or not.\n\n481\n00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.120\nBecause that's just\nthe nature of the beast.\n\n482\n00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:53.030\nSo that is an example of a feature\nwe'd see at the site level.\n\n483\n00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:56.550\nAnd you can see, as I scroll down here,\nin general there's a lot of different\n\n484\n00:27:56.550 --> 00:28:00.450\nfeatures that are not available\nat the site collection level.\n\n485\n00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.090\n>> All right Mark,\na lot of great information there.\n\n486\n00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.830\nWe got to see the creation\nof that site collection and\n\n487\n00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:09.080\nthen creating the site within it, and a\nlot of the different options that we have\n\n488\n00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.900\navailable once we get\nthat first site created.\n\n489\n00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:12.900\nWe thank you for that.\n\n490\n00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.600\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n491\n00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.120\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n492\n00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:17.940\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n493\n00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.951\n>> And we'll see you next

--> 00:00:17.036\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:19.890\nToday, we're doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.390\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.810\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\nconfiguring our service applications.\n\n7\n00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.580\nAnd here to help us with that,\nof course, is Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n8\n00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.960\nHow ya doing Mark?\n\n9\n00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.110\n>> Thanks, Mike, great to be back here.\n\n10\n00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.690\nLet's talk now about service applications.\n\n11\n00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.360\nNow, some of what, when it comes to\nlearning a new technology like SharePoint\n\n12\n00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.050\n2016, half the battle for those of you who\nhave experience with other versions of\n\n13\n00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.990\nthe product is unlearning\nwhat you already knew.\n\n14\n00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.000\nSo if you're brand new to product,\n\n15\n00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.390\nyou actually have an advantage\nbecause there's nothing to unlearn.\n\n16\n00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.070\nIt's all new to you.\n\n17\n00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.710\nSo everyone is welcome though,\n\n18\n00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.840\nyou can join the SharePoint bandwagon\nat any time, we'll make room.\n\n19\n00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.140\nIt's very expandable.\n\n20\n00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.740\nSo what we used to call shared service\nproviders in the moss 2007 era,\n\n21\n00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.385\nwhen Kobe was still playing basketball.\n\n22\n00:01:08.385 --> 00:01:10.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'll give you a metaphor there.\n\n23\n00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.350\nSo, a power supply.\n\n24\n00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.740\nLet's say it's possible and\nsome people are doing it.\n\n25\n00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.649\nThey're creating their own power\nsupply and living off the grid.\n\n26\n00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.922\nMaybe with hydro electric or\ngas generators for example.\n\n27\n00:01:22.922 --> 00:01:25.580\nMaybe some solar panels or\na combination thereof.\n\n28\n00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.238\nSo you could generate your own power,\nbut it's far easier just\n\n29\n00:01:31.238 --> 00:01:36.578\nto consume from region wide electricity or\nnuclear power,\n\n30\n00:01:36.578 --> 00:01:42.690\nsolar a variety of energy modalities\nif you will, you can tap into.\n\n31\n00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.560\nYou don't need to know anything about\npower you just need to know to plug in\n\n32\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.090\nyour appliance and you're good to go.\n\n33\n00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.330\nMaybe flip a circuit breaker occasionally.\n\n34\n00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.470\nSo bringing that back to a SharePoint\ncontext when we had shared service\n\n35\n00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.020\nproviders, the idea was we don't\nneed people reinventing the wheel.\n\n36\n00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.190\nFor example, let's say we have a very\nsmall deployment just starting out,\n\n37\n00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.910\nwe have ten site collections.\n\n38\n00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.850\nWe looks at site collections\nin another episode.\n\n39\n00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.630\nTheoretically each site collection\nadministrator could create their own\n\n40\n00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.440\nsearch infrastructure.\n\n41\n00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.880\nBut why bother?\n\n42\n00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.770\nWhen users from the different site\ncollections are probably going to want to\n\n43\n00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.680\nsearch across the same body of material\ninside, and outside the organization.\n\n44\n00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.510\nSo why not set up search\nat the farm level once.\n\n45\n00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.640\nAnd have farm level advance or\npeople with access, or\n\n46\n00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.300\nability to set up Crawl your accounts,\netc, to various sources.\n\n47\n00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.540\nBy the way, we'll have another episode,\nat least one.\n\n48\n00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.360\nProbably two just on search.\n\n49\n00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.650\nBut the point is we set up\nsearch ones at the level and\n\n50\n00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.090\nthen the collection\nadministrators can consume.\n\n51\n00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.410\nOr utilize, benefit from all that search\ninfrastructure that's been set up.\n\n52\n00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.560\nIt does not mean that site collection\nadministrators don't have any control\n\n53\n00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.690\nover their site collections and sites.\n\n54\n00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.050\nThey can tweak search as provided\nby the farm level and make it their\n\n55\n00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.020\nown in terms of maybe setting up search\nscopes or filtering out search results.\n\n56\n00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.610\nFor their users that are participating\nin their site collections, so\n\n57\n00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.340\nwe do the grand scale farm wide.\n\n58\n00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.200\nAnd we can make adjustments down\nat the site collection level.\n\n59\n00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.810\nThat's the concept of back in\nthe day a shared service provider.\n\n60\n00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.230\nNow we call them something different.\n\n61\n00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.910\nSometimes I think those people at\nMicrosoft and other tech companies,\n\n62\n00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.440\nall they do is dream up new terms,\none word or a couple words.\n\n63\n00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.700\nFor what we already knew just so they can\nmarket it as something new and fabulous.\n\n64\n00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.870\nSo now we call them service applications.\n\n65\n00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.260\nThe print spool is the same that we can\nset up a particular service and we'll give\n\n66\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.860\nyou some examples of those services that\ncan be provided in your SharePoint farm.\n\n67\n00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.330\nWe set them up once or maybe twice\ndepending on the divisional alignments,\n\n68\n00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.570\nlanguage issues, political considerations.\n\n69\n00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.260\nAnd then a variety of people, and\nsite collection administrators can consume\n\n70\n00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.190\nfrom those shared service applications.\n\n71\n00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.970\n>> It's gotta simplify\nthe overall architecture a little\n\n72\n00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.040\nbit by using shared services like that.\n\n73\n00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.830\n>> Absolutely.\nSo\n\n74\n00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.850\nagain, we don't want everyone and\ntheir dog creating their own examples or\n\n75\n00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.410\niterations of a service that\nIt's more efficient to do once.\n\n76\n00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.200\nAnd like mentioned in another episode,\n\n77\n00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.925\nwell as we want to set permissions\nat the highest level possible.\n\n78\n00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:30.860\nSell this is another example where if we\njust need one search service farm wide,\n\n79\n00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.710\nthere's no point in\ncreating multiple search.\n\n80\n00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.660\nBy the way we have talked a bit or eluded\nto the integration between on prem and\n\n81\n00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.940\ncloud deployments of SharePoint.\n\n82\n00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.050\nAnd one of the great things\nis you can go to your, say,\n\n83\n00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.510\nSharePoint online portal or\nfrom an O365 environment and search,\n\n84\n00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.970\nnot just your on prem data,\nbut also your cloud data.\n\n85\n00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.280\nSo we want to,\nagain Search is a great way to get your\n\n86\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.670\nusers enthusiastic about Sharepoint\nif they're new to product.\n\n87\n00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.620\nIf they know they can go to Sharepoint,\none place to go, in the Cloud or on-prem,\n\n88\n00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.150\nlet's say in the Cloud.\n\n89\n00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.690\nAnd they can search Cloud-based\nresources and on-prem resources,\n\n90\n00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.240\nother organizations One source.\n\n91\n00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.821\nThey get the search results returned.\n\n92\n00:05:11.821 --> 00:05:17.010\nThey're gonna be very happy and they'll\nbe more open to other new processes or\n\n93\n00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.850\nworkflows, for example that you may wanna\nintroduce to them that involve some change\n\n94\n00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.030\nin what they're doing now for their job or\nin the way your company does business.\n\n95\n00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.040\nSo you wanna get people the quick win and\nthen.\n\n96\n00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.660\nFeeling positive about Share Point.\n\n97\n00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.300\nI was gonna go the other way and\ntalk about the negative consequences but\n\n98\n00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.920\nlet's keep it positive and\nthat's how you get a win.\n\n99\n00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.320\nAll right, so\n\n100\n00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.100\nlet's look at some of the examples of\nservice applications you can provide.\n\n101\n00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.980\nThis is a partial list so\nsearch is a big one VIZIO services.\n\n102\n00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.030\nSo, if you have a need for\ncreating diagrams and\n\n103\n00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.010\nmaking that resource, the ability to\ncreate VIZIO diagrams, you can do that.\n\n104\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.930\nThe managed meta data service, we'll be\ntalking about that in another episode.\n\n105\n00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.800\nAnd you may recall from another\nepisode we talked about taxonomies,\n\n106\n00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.399\nlike the Dewey decimal system,\nterm sets so that could include.\n\n107\n00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.510\nJargon or\nproducts specific to our industry.\n\n108\n00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.540\nSo the clothing manufacturers example,\nthey'll have some nylon, polyester, rayon,\n\n109\n00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.320\nluan, I think that's a Lululemon product.\n\n110\n00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.720\nSo a variety of fabric types,\n\n111\n00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.390\nyou're going to have as maybe a drop\ndown menu option to classify or\n\n112\n00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:40.100\nhelp users search for\ngarments made with a particular fabric.\n\n113\n00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.940\nYou know, maybe someone is keen\non a particular fabric and\n\n114\n00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.620\nthey want to see all the products you\nhave that have that fabric in it.\n\n115\n00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.930\nLet's see,\nwe have the user profile service.\n\n116\n00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.790\nWe'll be showing you\na bunch about that as well.\n\n117\n00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.450\nIn terms of synchronizing user profiles,\n\n118\n00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:01.120\nexposing information about one's\nself in a SharePoint environment.\n\n119\n00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.300\nWe also have a translation service.\n\n120\n00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.310\nSo some of you watching are working\nin a multilingual environment.\n\n121\n00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.270\nEven in the US I'm saying this,\n\n122\n00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.920\nwe're now in a multilingual world\njust in the US, with Spanish.\n\n123\n00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.920\nFor me, a turning point as a few years\nago, I was on I think it was a DHL or\n\n124\n00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.910\none of the major international carriers.\n\n125\n00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.090\nIt was the US site, and\nthere was a language drop down.\n\n126\n00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.520\nDo you want to have English or\nSpanish as your choice?\n\n127\n00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.440\nI thought, wow,\nthat is a significant seat change.\n\n128\n00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.010\nWhen a company like that, that's based\nin the US or has a significant presence\n\n129\n00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.970\nin the US, is asking me to specify\na language, English or Spanish.\n\n130\n00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.990\nSo you may have a requirement, or people\nin your organization if you're worldwide,\n\n131\n00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.410\nto translate content, and\nthere's a shared service for that.\n\n132\n00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.919\nA service application called\nthe translation service.\n\n133\n00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.152\nOkay.\n\n134\n00:07:55.152 --> 00:07:59.384\nThose are some,\nnot an exhaustive list of service\n\n135\n00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:03.327\napplications available\nto us in SharePoint.\n\n136\n00:08:03.327 --> 00:08:07.330\nAnother one is the Business\nConnectivity Services, or BCS.\n\n137\n00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.258\nThat's not the Bull Championship Series.\n\n138\n00:08:09.258 --> 00:08:12.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're right here in Gator Country.\n\n139\n00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.060\n>> It is almost time to\nkick off the season.\n\n140\n00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.220\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n141\n00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.270\nThe hotels are going to quintuple for\nroom nights.\n\n142\n00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.940\nPeople will be sleeping in their cars.\n\n143\n00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.920\nBut I digress.\nSo BCS, think of it as middleware.\n\n144\n00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.770\nWe need to, SharePoint is great for\nexposing data, KPIs,\n\n145\n00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.130\nnumeric data, graphs, charts,\nmany of which can be interactive.\n\n146\n00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.920\nSo we can pull in data from\na variety of sources and display it.\n\n147\n00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.910\nNow, if it's a standard data\nsource like SAP or SQL database or\n\n148\n00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:48.000\neven Oracle database ODBC, OLE DB,\nthere is connectors built-in.\n\n149\n00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.800\nThere's nothing we have to do,\nwe don't have to contract out or\n\n150\n00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.040\nbuy some middleware online.\n\n151\n00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.280\nBut if it's a more obscure data source,\nmaybe a line of business source that\n\n152\n00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.540\nyou've created, we need a way for\nSharePoint to be able to interact.\n\n153\n00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.040\nIt's like a translator, if you will,\n\n154\n00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.820\nmiddleware between our SharePoint,\nwhere we can display and\n\n155\n00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.740\nmanipulate the data, and, let's say,\nthe database in which that data lives.\n\n156\n00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.330\nSo again there's third party connectors,\na lot of them are built-in,\n\n157\n00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.690\nyou might have inhouse dev resources that\ncan create the middleware to connect in.\n\n158\n00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.370\nSo that is another example of\na service application, BCS or\n\n159\n00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.160\nBusiness Connectivity Services.\n\n160\n00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.490\nThat acronym actually has\nchanged over the years as well,\n\n161\n00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:29.250\nso again if you use a previous\nversion of the product, or\n\n162\n00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.670\nmaybe gone away, or just not familiar with\n2016 or 2013, some of the terminology,\n\n163\n00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.790\nyou'll be familiar with the concepts,\nbut the acronyms changed.\n\n164\n00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:44.462\nAll right,\nlet's scanning through my notes here,\n\n165\n00:09:44.462 --> 00:09:51.961\nwe can have multiple instances\nof the same service application.\n\n166\n00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:54.523\nSo I gave you a rationale for\nthat earlier,\n\n167\n00:09:54.523 --> 00:09:56.920\nin terms of political consideration.\n\n168\n00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.670\nSo you might have, let's say, European\ndivision and a North American division,\n\n169\n00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:06.920\nand each division wants control over some\naspect of their service applications.\n\n170\n00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.880\nThey want to manage it, and control it,\nand configure it themselves, so\n\n171\n00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.110\nyou can have multiple instances\nof a service application.\n\n172\n00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.690\nNow in some cases, search for\nexample is a good example, especially if\n\n173\n00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.470\nyou're talking multi-language scenarios,\nwhere what's important to the European\n\n174\n00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.350\ndivision may not be as important where you\nhave different term sets because often\n\n175\n00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:28.890\nproducts are called different things\nin different parts of the world.\n\n176\n00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.390\nIt's the exact same product.\n\n177\n00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.050\nIt's just called by a different\ntrade name like cars, for example.\n\n178\n00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.320\nReminds me of the Chevy Nova in Mexico.\n\n179\n00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.350\nThat was not a good name in the Mexican\nmarket cuz Nova meant no go.\n\n180\n00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.190\nIt won't go.\n\n181\n00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.510\nSo that is an example of why you'd\nwant to have different divisions or\n\n182\n00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:52.600\nregions of your company managing\nthe service app separately from the other.\n\n183\n00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.830\nSo you have the capability to do that.\n\n184\n00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.470\nAll right, so\n\n185\n00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:00.500\nwe have some configuration to do and we'll\nall be showing you that very shortly.\n\n186\n00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.310\nWe need to do things in active directory.\n\n187\n00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.990\nAlso from our central admin website and at\nlast I'll be showing you some PowerShell\n\n188\n00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:14.020\nin the context of what\nwe're about to demonstrate.\n\n189\n00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.000\n>> Love PowerShell.\n\n190\n00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.740\n>> Indeed.\n\n191\n00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.050\nSo, I assume we have PowerShell courses,\nyes?\n\n192\n00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.220\n>> Yes, we do.\n>> Okay, excellent.\n\n193\n00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.670\n>> We've got a bunch of\nthem in the library.\n\n194\n00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.130\n>> Check the library if you're\nnot familiar with PowerShell.\n\n195\n00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.650\nIt's something that you're\ngonna wanna get familiar with,\n\n196\n00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:33.360\nbecause there's certain things\nyou can only do in PowerShell,\n\n197\n00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.830\never since Exchange 2007, I believe,\nwas the first server product from\n\n198\n00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.540\nMicrosoft that required PowerShell\nto do some administrative tasks.\n\n199\n00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.870\nAnd of course, many tasks you can\neither use the shell or the GUI.\n\n200\n00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.680\nBut for scripting, repetitive tasks,\nPowerShell is fantastic.\n\n201\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.400\nThe idea was to take the best from\nvarious languages and shells and\n\n202\n00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.110\ncombine it into one.\n\n203\n00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.100\nAnother reason we might wanna\nhave service applications or\n\n204\n00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.890\nsomething we can do with them is\nwe can delegate administration.\n\n205\n00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:03.430\nSo often in IT in the Windows world we're\ntalking about delegated administration, so\n\n206\n00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:08.230\nI might be an enterprise admin and\nthen you might be a domain admin, so\n\n207\n00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.370\nyou have great power in your domain.\n\n208\n00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.130\nBut I have power across all domains,\nif I'm Enterprise Admin.\n\n209\n00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.950\nAnd then, with organizational units,\nthat's a further way of delegating or\n\n210\n00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:23.940\nsubdividing authority, and so\n\n211\n00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.430\nthat we have the same kind of\nidea in the SharePoint context.\n\n212\n00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:31.070\nIn that I can empower you to be in control\nof a service application and all related\n\n213\n00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:35.460\nsettings, without giving you unnecessary\npermissions to the entire farm.\n\n214\n00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.280\n>> Nice.\n\n215\n00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.440\n>> Yeah, so that's cool.\n\n216\n00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.050\nAnd then we have this\nconcept of proxy groups,\n\n217\n00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:45.040\nso where shared service providers\nNow we have service applications.\n\n218\n00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.840\nProxy group means some unique\ncombination of service apps that we can\n\n219\n00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:55.100\ntreat as one or administer collectively so\nwe can have different proxy groups\n\n220\n00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.590\nto manage and interact with different\nresources in a SharePoint context.\n\n221\n00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.610\nOkay so\nnow the time has come to demonstrate.\n\n222\n00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.340\n>> Alright love to see it.\n\n223\n00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:07.970\n>> Good times.\n\n224\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.100\n>> Yes.\n>> So I have opened up my active directory\n\n225\n00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:16.190\nadministrative center, you may be\nunfamiliar with this if you haven't done\n\n226\n00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:22.720\nany SharePoint server admin lately, but\nit's another tool we can use our tool kit.\n\n227\n00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.570\nIt's different than\nActive Directory Users and Computers.\n\n228\n00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.470\nSome of the things you can do with\nActive Directory Users and Computers,\n\n229\n00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.760\nyou can do in active directory\nadministrative center.\n\n230\n00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.640\nOther things you can only do in the active\ndirectory administrative center.\n\n231\n00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.200\nOkay, so, we have a variety of Windows\nserver courses in the library as well, so\n\n232\n00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.350\nyou might want to check and\n\n233\n00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:45.150\ngo for more on the active\ndirectory administrative center.\n\n234\n00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.950\nAll right.\n\n235\n00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:51.060\nNow, let's go into my domain environment\nhere, where we have the ACME domain,\n\n236\n00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.440\nlike Wile E Coyote.\n\n237\n00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.490\nPaying homage to the Road Runner.\n\n238\n00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:03.000\nOkay, and I'm going to go over\nhere to the tasks menu or\n\n239\n00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.630\nwhere the menu options often are on\nthe right-hand side of the screen.\n\n240\n00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.320\nThis interface, it might take you\na little bit to get used to, but\n\n241\n00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.310\nnothing Earth-shatteringly complex.\n\n242\n00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:19.130\nSo new user is what I want and\nI'll give it a full name of,\n\n243\n00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:24.300\nlet's see here, let it load up, full name.\n\n244\n00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:29.750\nNotice how they have a nice big red\nasterisks, that denotes a required field.\n\n245\n00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:35.641\nSo I'll call this SharePoint,\nwe'll call it general\n\n246\n00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:44.825\nMMS and let's call\n\n247\n00:14:44.825 --> 00:14:50.905\nthis UPN logon here\n\n248\n00:14:50.905 --> 00:14:56.230\nSP general MMS.\n\n249\n00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:03.790\nAnd we have the same account name there so\nthat's good.\n\n250\n00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.760\nA password, onto the password.\n\n251\n00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.792\nWhat password am I gonna use,\nyeah that one.\n\n252\n00:15:12.743 --> 00:15:16.130\nSo many passwords in my head it's\ntough to have to remember sometimes.\n\n253\n00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.600\nWhich one of several standard\nones they use for these demos.\n\n254\n00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:25.430\nUsing it, so thankfully it tells\nme the passwords don't match.\n\n255\n00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.050\nSo I'll reenter, no problem.\n\n256\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.510\nAnd I'm gonna say password never expires.\n\n257\n00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.050\nSo we'll click on other password options.\n\n258\n00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.755\nSome of the things you can do with\nActive Directory Users and Computers,\n\n259\n00:15:38.755 --> 00:15:41.620\nyou can do in active directory\nadministrative center.\n\n260\n00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:45.800\nSo I'll say password never expires,\nuser cannot change password.\n\n261\n00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:51.343\nSome of the things you can do with\nActive Directory Users and Computers,\n\n262\n00:15:51.343 --> 00:15:53.862\nyou can do in active directory\nadministrative center.\n\n263\n00:15:53.862 --> 00:16:01.524\nAll right, so now there is PowerShell\nthat is built-in to Windows.\n\n264\n00:16:01.524 --> 00:16:05.183\nSo I can open that as a regular user or\nas an administrator.\n\n265\n00:16:05.183 --> 00:16:08.820\nThere's also various shells for\nserver products.\n\n266\n00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.270\nThere's an exchange management shell,\nfor example, for exchange.\n\n267\n00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:15.860\nIn our case, we're interested in\nthe SharePoint management shell.\n\n268\n00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.670\nAll that means is it might have\na different background color,\n\n269\n00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.560\nblack versus blue and you can customize\nthat as you can change the font as well.\n\n270\n00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.260\nAll that means when we say\nSharePoint management shell\n\n271\n00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:30.440\nit's the Windows PowerShell\nwith extra commandlets loaded\n\n272\n00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.890\nin a module specific to\nSharePoint administration.\n\n273\n00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.680\nSo if I open up Windows PowerShell and\nadded, or\n\n274\n00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.490\nimported a module for SharePoint,\n\n275\n00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:46.470\nthat would include hundreds of commandlets\nwhich would let me administer SharePoint.\n\n276\n00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:50.670\nBut rather than have to do that, I just\nopen the SharePoint Management Shell, so\n\n277\n00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.700\nthat's Windows PowerShell with\nthe SharePoint commandlets\n\n278\n00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.320\nautomatically loaded, so then I don't have\nto wait around or do an extra action.\n\n279\n00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.410\nI'm ready to go and\nmy SharePoint knowledge and\n\n280\n00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.300\ncommands will work, in that context.\n\n281\n00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:04.400\n>> Convenient.\n\n282\n00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.420\n>> Very convenient.\n\n283\n00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:11.780\nSo I'll go, SharePoints and\n\n284\n00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.740\nyou might have noticed since it's\nWindows 2008 or was it 2012?\n\n285\n00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:16.740\nActually it's 2012.\n\n286\n00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.910\nYou are going to hit the start menu and\njust start typing.\n\n287\n00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.000\nYou might be looking around okay where\ndo i click where is the search field,\n\n288\n00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:23.630\nI can't find it.\n\n289\n00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:27.860\nNo you just start typing and\nthe field magically appears.\n\n290\n00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.310\nIf you build it, they will come.\n\n291\n00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.830\n>> They will.\n\n292\n00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.470\n>> If you type it, the field will appear.\n\n293\n00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:37.130\nOkay, so you can start typing it and\nthen you'll see a list populate and so\n\n294\n00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:39.350\nyou want to type the entire name\nof what you're looking for.\n\n295\n00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:42.760\nYou just start typing and then use\nthe arrow or click your mouse button or\n\n296\n00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.860\ntouch the screen.\n\n297\n00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.950\nSo, I want the sheriff one 2016.\n\n298\n00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.170\nAll right, so\nnow we have our PowerShell prompt up.\n\n299\n00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:50.200\nIt usually takes about ten seconds.\n\n300\n00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.430\nYou could start typing\nif you felt like it, but\n\n301\n00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:57.050\nif you weren't confident I would wait\ntill the PowerShell prompt appears.\n\n302\n00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:01.170\nBut if you did start typing before the\nprompt appears that would still count as\n\n303\n00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.350\nvalid input and it would display all\nthe characters you had previously typed.\n\n304\n00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.410\nSo just take ten seconds for yourself.\n\n305\n00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:07.920\n>> Yeah, get yourself a coffee.\n\n306\n00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.070\n>> Look out into the distance.\n\n307\n00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:10.360\nGive your eyes a break.\n\n308\n00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:16.690\nAll right, so and I'm not going to cover\neverything from a PowerShell context,\n\n309\n00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:20.580\nor a SharePoint management context, there\nwill be some assumed knowledge here, but\n\n310\n00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:25.030\nI encourage you if you're PowerShell\ncurious, check out our library of videos\n\n311\n00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.700\nand I think you'll be as impressed\nas I am how easy it is to get into.\n\n312\n00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.110\nAll right, so I'm gonna declare\na variable here, which will be service\n\n313\n00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:39.020\nequals new-SPState-Service.\n\n314\n00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.140\nNow I was able to use tab complete.\n\n315\n00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:41.910\nThis is very handy.\n\n316\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.320\nSo I can type in the first, and you learn\nover time how many characters you need to\n\n317\n00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:50.700\ntype before hitting the tab button so\nI typed in New-SPS and\n\n318\n00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.130\nhit tab and it filled out the rest for me.\n\n319\n00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.020\nLet's say I didn't type in enough\nunique characters, no problem.\n\n320\n00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:00.170\nI can just hit the tab key and\nit will cycle through the relevant\n\n321\n00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:04.700\ncorresponding commandlets that correspond\nto the number of characters I typed.\n\n322\n00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.710\nOr, I can also use Shift+Tab to\ngo back up through the list.\n\n323\n00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.400\nYou don't have to use Tab complete but\nit sure makes life easier,\n\n324\n00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:15.630\nit also pretties it up and capitalizes\nit so that it's easier to parse,\n\n325\n00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.990\nread as a human being.\n\n326\n00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:24.596\nCapitalization is not critical from\na SharePoint management self perspective,\n\n327\n00:19:24.596 --> 00:19:27.070\nbut again, it's easier to read.\n\n328\n00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.900\nSo if you type that all lowercase it\nwould have the exact same effect if we\n\n329\n00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.270\nran or hit enter.\n\n330\n00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.780\nBut I need to specify a name here.\n\n331\n00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:42.110\nAnd even many, not all, but many\nparameters also I work with tab complete.\n\n332\n00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:51.580\nSo I put a space in there, so\nI'm gonna call this Acme State Service.\n\n333\n00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.970\nAnd in quotes,\nanother thing I love about Powershell.\n\n334\n00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.600\nIn fact,\nwell actually I don't wanna risk it,\n\n335\n00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.130\nbut I was gonna intentionally\nleave off the closing quotes.\n\n336\n00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:08.200\nUnlike other technologies or\nother error interfaces you actually do get\n\n337\n00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.330\na lot of useful information,\nnot every time but most of the time.\n\n338\n00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.150\nIf there's some error,\nit'll tell you the line,\n\n339\n00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:18.590\nmaybe the character where there was\nan issue and then you get a ink.\n\n340\n00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.686\nIt reminds some of you of\nhigh school English essays.\n\n341\n00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:22.359\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Teacher.\n\n342\n00:20:22.359 --> 00:20:25.400\nBut the red ink is useful\n\n343\n00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.810\nbecause you can usually pretty\nquickly tell, okay I must've.\n\n344\n00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:33.189\nMistype something or left out a dash\nto denote a parameter, for example,\n\n345\n00:20:33.189 --> 00:20:36.094\nbut I'm pretty sure I typed that\ncorrectly so I'll hit enter.\n\n346\n00:20:39.762 --> 00:20:44.590\nAnd wait, so it take a while to\ncreate this SharePoint state\n\n347\n00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:48.850\nservice application so\nwe'll wait for that to occur\n\n348\n00:20:56.961 --> 00:21:01.600\nWhile we're waiting the next thing we're\ngonna do is create a service database.\n\n349\n00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.180\nSo in the previous\nepisode we talked about,\n\n350\n00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:09.180\nwe looked at actually, in SQL context,\nsome of the large number of databases\n\n351\n00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.790\nthat gets created in our SharePoint\nenvironment, not just content databases,\n\n352\n00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:17.020\ndatabase for content but\ndepending on the functionality we enable.\n\n353\n00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:21.760\nOur service application the we configure,\neach of them come with one or\n\n354\n00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:26.440\nmore databases, so we end up with dozens\nof databases in our SQL environment, okay.\n\n355\n00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.600\nThat created successfully.\n\n356\n00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:34.070\nAnd one more thing I'll show you here is\nwe'll create this state server database.\n\n357\n00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:39.520\nThat's new SP State Service.\n\n358\n00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.550\nSo here's an example of\nusing tab to complete.\n\n359\n00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.600\nThat's not the one I want.\n\n360\n00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.950\nI'll hit tab, and\n\n361\n00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.870\nthen I got to the command that I want,\nNew-SPStateServiceDatabase.\n\n362\n00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:52.790\nCommandlets in PowerShell\nare always a combination of a verb,\n\n363\n00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:55.415\nI know new isn't exactly a verb but\nbear with me.\n\n364\n00:21:55.415 --> 00:21:57.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Think of it as create new.\n\n365\n00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:57.830\n>> Yeah.\n\n366\n00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:01.880\n>> If you like and then a hyphen and\nthen what we're creating.\n\n367\n00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.840\nSo we're creating a new\nSPStateServiceDatabase.\n\n368\n00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.590\nGood times, I need to give it a name.\n\n369\n00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:13.240\nSo I'll call that AcmeState.\n\n370\n00:22:20.992 --> 00:22:26.578\nDb and I have to specify\na service application to associate\n\n371\n00:22:26.578 --> 00:22:33.304\nwith that database, again tab complete\nworks for most parameters and\n\n372\n00:22:33.304 --> 00:22:38.218\nthat's the service variable\nI declared earlier.\n\n373\n00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:46.067\n>> So your first command created\nthe what did we create there?\n\n374\n00:22:46.067 --> 00:22:48.843\nThat service and\nthen you stored that in a variable and\n\n375\n00:22:48.843 --> 00:22:52.977\nthen in your second command rather than\nhave to specify the entire long name that\n\n376\n00:22:52.977 --> 00:22:56.430\nyou might have given it when you\ncreated it it's in that variable so\n\n377\n00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.469\nyou just say service and\nthen you give that variable name.\n\n378\n00:22:59.469 --> 00:23:01.350\nAnd it knows exactly what\nservice you're talking about.\n\n379\n00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:04.390\n>> Exactly, so I gave you wrong\ninformation at first, actually.\n\n380\n00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:09.780\nI forgot that we were actually declaring a\nvariable not creating the sp state service\n\n381\n00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:14.950\napplication from the first\nline of typing there.\n\n382\n00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:18.100\nSo it did get created,\nalong with the database.\n\n383\n00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:18.880\nThanks for that Mike.\n\n384\n00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.330\n>> Yep.\n>> And we can see the result of that,\n\n385\n00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:23.160\nthe AcmeStateDb with an Id number.\n\n386\n00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.160\nAnd more information which we could\noutput to a file if we wanted.\n\n387\n00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.550\n>> Very good.\nAll right, Mark,\n\n388\n00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.460\nI know you got more to show us with\nPowerShell and with SharePoint.\n\n389\n00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.300\nBut unfortunately we're out of time for\nthis particular episode so\n\n390\n00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.850\nwe've got to come back and\ndo a part two on this one.\n\n391\n00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:37.540\nBut great information.\n\n392\n00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.300\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n393\n00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.780\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n394\n00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.640\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n395\n00:23:42.640 -->

00:00:15.433\nat ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:16.966\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.485\nToday, we're doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:23.736\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at managing user's\n\n7\n00:00:23.736 --> 00:00:28.191\npermissions and just generally securing\ncontent in our SharePoint environment.\n\n8\n00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:31.160\nAnd here to help us with all\nthat is of course Mark Ingram.\n\n9\n00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.916\nHow's it going Mark?\n\n10\n00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:33.850\n>> Good, Mike, thanks very much.\n\n11\n00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.394\nAll right, so if you're watching along\nvarious episodes in our course then you've\n\n12\n00:00:38.394 --> 00:00:39.938\nseen some 100% theory.\n\n13\n00:00:39.938 --> 00:00:43.235\nThis is closer than 90% hands on demos.\n\n14\n00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:43.940\n>> All right.\n\n15\n00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.949\n>> Let's plunge right in.\n\n16\n00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.950\nAll right so from server manager,\nwe're going to launch our ADAC,\n\n17\n00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.480\nactive directory administrative center.\n\n18\n00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.120\nYou can do a lot of things\njust like you can with ADAC,\n\n19\n00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.960\nactive directory users of computers but\neven more.\n\n20\n00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.160\nSo it's my go-to interface\nwhenever possible.\n\n21\n00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.490\nWe're going to create some\nSharePoint groups and\n\n22\n00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.140\nthen assign users to those groups and\ncheck out\n\n23\n00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.520\nthe impact that has on various kinds\nof access to our SharePoint resources.\n\n24\n00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.260\nSo as always, you wanna give just\nenough permission to do things,\n\n25\n00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.220\nto accomplish tasks and no more.\n\n26\n00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.390\n>> So\ngood old principle of least privilege.\n\n27\n00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.410\nAnd these are just standard security\ngroups with inactive director, right.\n\n28\n00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.189\nNot SharePoint specific at this point,\nright.\n\n29\n00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.390\n>> Right,\nwe're just adding Active Directory groups.\n\n30\n00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.860\nWe will add SharePoint-specific\ngroups later.\n\n31\n00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.900\nThat was a little foreshadowing there,\nwhich I like, at times.\n\n32\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.440\nSo going to add gin to\nthis user group there.\n\n33\n00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.417\nSome of you may be wanting gin\nat the end of this long demo.\n\n34\n00:01:47.417 --> 00:01:51.498\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That was J-I-N for\n\n35\n00:01:51.498 --> 00:01:54.713\nthe record, not G-I-N.\n\n36\n00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:56.624\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it created a SharePoint full\n\n37\n00:01:56.624 --> 00:01:57.863\ncontrol group as well.\n\n38\n00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.900\nAnd couple more to create here.\n\n39\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.000\n>> And good naming conventions,\nalways a recommendation, right?\n\n40\n00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.610\nYou see the way he's naming these groups,\nSharePoint at the beginning and then\n\n41\n00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.430\nthe permission that that group is going to\nbe assigned ultimately within SharePoint.\n\n42\n00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.440\nAnd that's gonna help you,\n\n43\n00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.930\nit's gonna help other administrators\nto know what that groups purpose is.\n\n44\n00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.210\nI also love it when I'm searching, right?\n\n45\n00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.424\nBecause we all know about our\nActive Directory searches and\n\n46\n00:02:27.424 --> 00:02:31.344\nthings like that and if every SharePoint\ngroup starts with SharePoint,\n\n47\n00:02:31.344 --> 00:02:33.222\nthen we type in share check names.\n\n48\n00:02:33.222 --> 00:02:36.054\nWe get that list of all\nthe SharePoint specific groups and\n\n49\n00:02:36.054 --> 00:02:37.530\nit makes it easy to find them.\n\n50\n00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.540\nSo lots of good reasons to follow those\nbest practices for our naming conventions.\n\n51\n00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.920\n>> Make it easy on yourself,\nmake it easy on your colleagues.\n\n52\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.150\nDon't get cute with baby names or\nStar Trek name's are a little geeky.\n\n53\n00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.430\nI guess if you wanted to name your\nserver some kind of Star Trek thing.\n\n54\n00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.640\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n\n55\n00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.620\nMachine names, that's okay, right?\n\n56\n00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.670\nAt least in my world.\n\n57\n00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.547\nBecause all my machines, at home,\nare Star Wars [INAUDIBLE].\n\n58\n00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:03.480\n[LAUGH]\n>> Nothing against Star Wars or Star Trek.\n\n59\n00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.980\nOkay, so now we're going to\ncreate a permission policy.\n\n60\n00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.770\nThis applies to the web application and\nall the site collections hosted within it.\n\n61\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.400\nRemember our hierarchy in SharePoint, our\nfarm is the entire SharePoint deployment.\n\n62\n00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.590\nWithin that we have application\npools which host web applications,\n\n63\n00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.040\nwhich then allow us to\ncreate site collections.\n\n64\n00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.580\nSo there's permission policy levels\nhere at the web app level and\n\n65\n00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.930\nwe're gonna create a policy level for\ncontent auditors.\n\n66\n00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.400\nAnd choose the auditor checkbox\nthere say collection auditor.\n\n67\n00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.750\n>> So they got a pre-built option for\nauditors there.\n\n68\n00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.810\n>> Right, and\nwe also grabbed some specific permissions,\n\n69\n00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.670\nwell, more granual permissions.\n\n70\n00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.140\nWe're not gonna cover all these here, but\n\n71\n00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.590\njust enough we're gonna enable in\norder to allow for auditing to occur.\n\n72\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.430\nSo, open items,\nthe ability to view versions, so\n\n73\n00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.778\nprevious versions of a document.\n\n74\n00:04:02.778 --> 00:04:07.520\nIf we've enabled that versioning\nfunctionality at the sight collection\n\n75\n00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.020\nlevel or the document library level or\nlists level.\n\n76\n00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.010\nAnd we'll save those permissions.\n\n77\n00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.340\nNow you can see the new policy\nlevel there at the bottom.\n\n78\n00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.010\nThe content auditors\npolicy level plus the four\n\n79\n00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.950\ndefault policy levels pertaining\nto that web application.\n\n80\n00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.080\nNow, let's go over to the user policy and\nthese are built in as well.\n\n81\n00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.860\nWe've got a couple for\nthe search crawling account.\n\n82\n00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.130\nWe have a couple of episodes on search.\n\n83\n00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.100\nBut right now, we're going to add a user.\n\n84\n00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.300\nAll zones and here's where we can type\nin part of the user or group name.\n\n85\n00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.630\nAnd I like to hit enter and\nthen you get a red squiggly line.\n\n86\n00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.670\nAnd then you can click on\nwhat was underlined and\n\n87\n00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.930\nthe user or group names corresponding\nto the part I typed in are there.\n\n88\n00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.900\nI'm going to use the content auditor\npermission, assign that to our content\n\n89\n00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.810\nauditor's active directory group and\nI'll add more users here.\n\n90\n00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.690\nAgain, all zones of your call,\nzones refers to the different vector,\n\n91\n00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.830\na different way to access the same\ncontent whether it's intranet or\n\n92\n00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.590\nintranet or extranet.\n\n93\n00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.980\nRather than having to duplicate all the\ncontent for different user populations.\n\n94\n00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.840\nSo full control, your permissions for\n\n95\n00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.580\nthe SharePoint full control\nactive directory group.\n\n96\n00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.620\nAnd I keep on adding users.\n\n97\n00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.620\nAgain all zones.\n\n98\n00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.700\nAnd this time,\nI want the deny access group.\n\n99\n00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.270\nNow, it's good to fully get cognizant\nwith all the different permission\n\n100\n00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.000\nlevels at different places in the farm.\n\n101\n00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.320\nSo you might be familiar with Deny\nfrom regular NT folder permissions,\n\n102\n00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.920\nbut look what Deny means.\n\n103\n00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.800\nYou can have a Deny Read and\na Deny All, for example,\n\n104\n00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.670\nso at different levels of SharePoint,\nit's inconsistent frankly.\n\n105\n00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.900\nThe permissions options so\njust take your time and\n\n106\n00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.940\nexamine what full read,\nthat's not something we see every day.\n\n107\n00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.600\nWe're used to seeing read or\nfull control but not full read.\n\n108\n00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.615\nIt almost seems designed to deceive or\nconfuse.\n\n109\n00:06:20.615 --> 00:06:22.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, just take your time with it.\n\n110\n00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.215\n>> Like you're Microsoft.\n\n111\n00:06:24.215 --> 00:06:26.980\n>> [LAUGH] Well, I say,\nconfusion equals cash.\n\n112\n00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.431\nRight, if things worked the way\nthey're supposed to every time,\n\n113\n00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:30.540\nthere'd be less need for us.\n\n114\n00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.360\n>> Yeah, that's true.\n\n115\n00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.590\n>> Like plug and play.\n\n116\n00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.900\nThankfully, it's plug and\npray quite often.\n\n117\n00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.039\nJustify our presence there.\n\n118\n00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.050\nSupport personnel or what have you.\n\n119\n00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.180\nAll right so now I'm into,\n\n120\n00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.260\nI'm gonna check out there's\na sample document in my library.\n\n121\n00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.675\nAnd I'm gonna click on an ellipsis\nthat's those three dots there and\n\n122\n00:06:51.675 --> 00:06:56.509\nthat will reveal even more actions\nwith another ellipsis or a few dots.\n\n123\n00:06:58.599 --> 00:06:59.753\nSo I click on that,\n\n124\n00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:04.677\nyou can see options there like the ability\nto access version history, and more.\n\n125\n00:07:06.693 --> 00:07:10.194\nAnd also this is where I would\nupload new documents as well.\n\n126\n00:07:15.413 --> 00:07:19.868\nNow I'm gonna open a separate\nbrowser session for\n\n127\n00:07:19.868 --> 00:07:24.639\neach user account that I\nplan to work with to, again,\n\n128\n00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:27.940\nit's one thing to set permissions.\n\n129\n00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.980\nWe definitely wanna verify that we set\nthe permissions we thought we did.\n\n130\n00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.230\nBecause we might have made\na mistake at some level and\n\n131\n00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.520\ngranted way too much access or not enough.\n\n132\n00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.730\nNot enough, is less critical because\nHelpdesk will certainly hear from\n\n133\n00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.110\nthe person whose expecting\nto access some content.\n\n134\n00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:51.405\nNow, few is the, few people would\nactually, we've got today's headlines.\n\n135\n00:07:51.405 --> 00:07:53.759\nI thought I'd eliminated that but\napparently not.\n\n136\n00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:56.654\n[LAUGH] There's Putin on there,\ngood Ole Vlad.\n\n137\n00:07:56.654 --> 00:07:57.628\nAnyway.\n\n138\n00:07:57.628 --> 00:07:58.595\nI had a point there.\n\n139\n00:07:58.595 --> 00:07:59.696\nYeah.\nSo few people,\n\n140\n00:07:59.696 --> 00:08:04.630\nif they discover, I'm not sure if\nI'm supposed to have access to that.\n\n141\n00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:09.130\nFew people are going to actually admit\nto that and say, excuse me, help desk.\n\n142\n00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.490\nI have too many permissions here.\n\n143\n00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.882\nCould you please restrict\nwhat I can look at.\n\n144\n00:08:12.882 --> 00:08:16.144\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's good for you to test and\n\n145\n00:08:16.144 --> 00:08:17.846\nknow in advance.\n\n146\n00:08:17.846 --> 00:08:22.160\nAnd, okay,\nthat's what I was expecting there.\n\n147\n00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.240\nSorry, this site hasn't\nbeen shared with you.\n\n148\n00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.780\nSo, that's again what I\nwas expecting to see.\n\n149\n00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:36.950\nSo now, I'm gonna add a user to a member\n\n150\n00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:42.400\nSharePoint group here, so\nI'll go down into Site Settings.\n\n151\n00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.550\nClick on People and\nGroups under User and Permissions there.\n\n152\n00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.550\nClick on New.\n\n153\n00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.410\nAnd I just want to share with Jen.\n\n154\n00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.582\nUnderline, that's a good sign.\n\n155\n00:09:02.283 --> 00:09:04.530\nI'll check and\nmake sure I have access to that content.\n\n156\n00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.550\nSo again, instead of having to log out and\nlog in, I'll just open a private browsing\n\n157\n00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:17.560\nsession right within IE, so I'll have a\nvariety of Internet Explorer windows open.\n\n158\n00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.480\nBut it's a lot faster to switch\nbetween those than to sign out and\n\n159\n00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.620\nsign in continually.\n\n160\n00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.371\n>> And so, even though you added Jen to a\ngroup you still had to add his actual user\n\n161\n00:09:28.371 --> 00:09:30.763\naccount to people in\ngroups within SharePoint.\n\n162\n00:09:30.763 --> 00:09:33.770\nMaybe that's why we got that message\nsite hasn't been shared with you.\n\n163\n00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:34.937\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n164\n00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:41.745\nAnd I'm just gonna add\nthis as a home page, so\n\n165\n00:09:41.745 --> 00:09:46.325\nwe don't keep see MSN which\nis designed to distract.\n\n166\n00:09:46.325 --> 00:09:48.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n167\n00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:53.370\nSo I can just verify that I have\naccess to that sample document, and\n\n168\n00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.570\nI can check properties and\nperform a variety of other actions there.\n\n169\n00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.949\nThat's all I wanted to verify there.\n\n170\n00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:15.143\nNext up, I wanna add a user to\na site's visitors SharePoint group.\n\n171\n00:10:15.143 --> 00:10:18.401\nSo, sometimes you have to click on more if\nyou don't see the group you're looking for\n\n172\n00:10:18.401 --> 00:10:20.681\nunder the group's heading on\nthe quick launch to the left.\n\n173\n00:10:29.179 --> 00:10:32.361\nAnd there's my Acme

Share.\n\n176\n00:10:51.811 --> 00:10:54.190\nAnd as I always say, trust but verify.\n\n177\n00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.818\nSo we're gonna go open another browser\n\n178\n00:10:58.818 --> 00:11:03.460\nwindow now in IE, and open that as Ray.\n\n179\n00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.462\nYou can call me Ray.\n\n180\n00:11:04.462 --> 00:11:11.045\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Takes a few seconds to open up.\n\n181\n00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:11.831\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n182\n00:11:17.613 --> 00:11:19.750\n>> So there is a fair amount\nof waiting in Sharepoint.\n\n183\n00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:24.642\nEven if you have a lot of resources thrown\nat it, you can expect to wait as sites\n\n184\n00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:28.204\nget created, or you're waiting for\nlists to display.\n\n185\n00:11:28.204 --> 00:11:31.759\n>> And like you said,\na lot of that's the first time,\n\n186\n00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:35.665\nif once that gets cached,\nit does speed up the process.\n\n187\n00:11:35.665 --> 00:11:36.378\n>> True.\n\n188\n00:11:38.283 --> 00:11:41.165\nSo, you should run scripts\nto cache content that's\n\n189\n00:11:41.165 --> 00:11:44.897\ngonna be accessed by many people\nthroughout the day, for example,\n\n190\n00:11:44.897 --> 00:11:49.087\notherwise the first person to access in\nthe intranet site through the day for\n\n191\n00:11:49.087 --> 00:11:52.711\nexample, would have to wait a few\nminutes for the page to render.\n\n192\n00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:57.695\nBut if you have a script that accesses the\nsite beforehand, then that site will have\n\n193\n00:11:57.695 --> 00:12:02.248\nbeen cached, and the first user of\nthe day will get better performance, and\n\n194\n00:12:02.248 --> 00:12:04.720\nthe page will load faster.\n\n195\n00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.890\nSo there's no new documents link,\nI can see documents there, but\n\n196\n00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.850\nthe new documents link is missing.\n\n197\n00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.310\nThat's another great\nthing about SharePoint.\n\n198\n00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.180\nTo reiterate, if I don't have\npermissions to do an action,\n\n199\n00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.890\nthat action does not appear.\n\n200\n00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:21.190\nEither in the body of the site there or\nthrough any drop down menu options.\n\n201\n00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:25.070\nSo it's the kind of thing where people\ndon't know what they're missing.\n\n202\n00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:29.270\nBut if you have an option, a drop down and\nit's a grayed out selection,\n\n203\n00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:33.550\nthat can be frustrating, because then the\nuser knows that the capability exists, but\n\n204\n00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:38.120\nfor some reason they or\nmaybe a group in which they are member,\n\n205\n00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.240\ncannot access and then they start\ncalling help desk, do you know who I am?\n\n206\n00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.225\nI should have access to everything.\n\n207\n00:12:42.225 --> 00:12:44.020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, if they don't see the option,\n\n208\n00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.850\nthey're not gonna complain about it.\n\n209\n00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.390\nUsually.\n\n210\n00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.340\nNow we're going into Designers here.\n\n211\n00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.328\nIt's one of the new SharePoint group for\ndesigners.\n\n212\n00:12:54.114 --> 00:12:58.256\nAnd SharePoint Designers, remember\nthat's an add on from front page, so\n\n213\n00:12:58.256 --> 00:13:00.570\nwe're gonna give Tony this permission.\n\n214\n00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:06.660\nSo designers can alter the look and\nfeel of a SharePoint environment,\n\n215\n00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.132\nand can really destroy things, frankly.\n\n216\n00:13:09.132 --> 00:13:09.825\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n217\n00:13:09.825 --> 00:13:13.411\nvery few people should have access\nto that designer permission,\n\n218\n00:13:13.411 --> 00:13:17.270\nbecause they can change the fonts,\ncolor schemes, and more.\n\n219\n00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.110\nAnd a little knowledge\nis a dangerous thing, so\n\n220\n00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.860\nif someone's just playing around.\n\n221\n00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.690\nNow if it's their own My Sites that's\ndifferent, because the consequence for\n\n222\n00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:29.890\nscrewing up, maybe it's only them,\nthat person themself that's affected.\n\n223\n00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.961\nBut if you allow just anyone to play with\ndesigner in a production environment,\n\n224\n00:13:33.961 --> 00:13:37.686\nyou could very quickly have\na non-functional SharePoint deployment.\n\n225\n00:13:37.686 --> 00:13:41.061\nSo people that, again,\nare responsible for the look and feel,\n\n226\n00:13:41.061 --> 00:13:43.450\nthat's who should have access to Designer.\n\n227\n00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:46.510\nOkay.\n\n228\n00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.570\nSo, now I'm verifying, logged in as Tony.\n\n229\n00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:54.790\nThat's, yes in fact, Tony can adjust\nthe look and feel of the site.\n\n230\n00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:58.080\nI clicked on edit and\nyou can see your various zones and\n\n231\n00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.070\nweb parts that I can edit.\n\n232\n00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.770\nI just removed\nthe Getting Started web part.\n\n233\n00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:07.550\nI'm gonna save that change.\n\n234\n00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:10.340\nIn the upper right there is a Save button,\nand\n\n235\n00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.100\nbriefly you saw a little\nsaving dialogue box.\n\n236\n00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.200\nAnd now that getting started section or\nweb part is missing from the team site,\n\n237\n00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.170\nand that'll be true for\nanyone accessing that team site.\n\n238\n00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:25.180\nIt shows you how quick it is to\nmake a change in SharePoint.\n\n239\n00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:32.370\nAgain, which is why only certain people\nshould get the chance to edit, all right.\n\n240\n00:14:34.656 --> 00:14:35.515\nNow.\n\n241\n00:14:39.092 --> 00:14:40.055\nBack here at the Team Site.\n\n242\n00:14:46.267 --> 00:14:47.380\nWhich is not what I want.\n\n243\n00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.900\nI want to be in.\n\n244\n00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.120\nThat's one problem with mini windows is\nsometimes you forget which one you're\n\n245\n00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.030\nactually working on.\n\n246\n00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.020\nHowever, even hovering over\nsometimes you can see the logged in\n\n247\n00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.070\nuser in the upper right.\n\n248\n00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:02.460\nShow system account here, and then I\ncan make the change at the right place.\n\n249\n00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.110\nSo, I'm at my Acme Team Site homepage.\n\n250\n00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:11.100\nClick on the gear icon near the upper\nright, and go into Site Settings.\n\n251\n00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.350\nAnd the first section there,\nUsers and Permissions,\n\n252\n00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:15.920\nI'll click on site permissions.\n\n253\n00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.390\nNow, we've got permission levels.\n\n254\n00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:24.780\nSo, in the gold bar there we've\ngot some different permission\n\n255\n00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:29.740\nlevels for\nsome of the site content displayed here.\n\n256\n00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.300\nSo just know that you can just\nlike with anti vest permissions\n\n257\n00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.150\nthat you can break inheritance,\n\n258\n00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:39.390\nso the default would be for subfolders to\ninherit permissions of the parent folder.\n\n259\n00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:41.230\nYou can break inheritance and\n\n260\n00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:45.920\nnot have changes to the parent folder\npermissions affect the subfolder.\n\n261\n00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.520\nSo you have that capability in SharePoint.\n\n262\n00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.129\nYou also have the ability for\n\n263\n00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:53.100\nchild item to revert back to\ninheriting permissions from the parent.\n\n264\n00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.130\nSo that's a good out.\n\n265\n00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.758\nIn case you accidentally break something,\npermissions wise,\n\n266\n00:15:58.758 --> 00:16:00.242\nyou can always go back to.\n\n267\n00:16:00.242 --> 00:16:03.012\nHaving the child object\ninherit permissions.\n\n268\n00:16:03.012 --> 00:16:05.804\n>> Been there done that.\n\n269\n00:16:05.804 --> 00:16:08.620\n>> [LAUGH] I'm sure we all have actually.\n\n270\n00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.080\nI want to be able to\nview web analytics data.\n\n271\n00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.828\nIn this permission level.\n\n272\n00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:22.979\nOkay, and then it's the view usage\ndata permission level which will allow\n\n273\n00:16:22.979 --> 00:16:25.020\nme to view web analytics data.\n\n274\n00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.560\nSo I'll create a new SharePoint group.\n\n275\n00:16:32.029 --> 00:16:36.180\nAnd assign that group the permission we're\nlooking for which is view usage data.\n\n276\n00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.050\nLet's go back into people and groups,\n\n277\n00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:47.540\nclick on groups in the upper left And\nnew, this one will be usage monitors.\n\n278\n00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.600\nI'll scroll down.\n\n279\n00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.470\nAnd it's the view usage data.\n\n280\n00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.520\nCustom permission level\nI created previously.\n\n281\n00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.786\nIn the usage monitors page,\nI'm gonna click on New.\n\n282\n00:17:11.996 --> 00:17:13.627\nHere we go.\n\n283\n00:17:17.096 --> 00:17:18.610\nThis time I'll enter Willa.\n\n284\n00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:22.450\nNotice how the, Willa's name\nappears down below as I'm typing.\n\n285\n00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:23.690\nSo that's kind of nice.\n\n286\n00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:27.990\nSo I can stop typing if I want and\njust click on this selection.\n\n287\n00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.610\nSave some time.\n\n288\n00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.440\nAnd, again, we're verifying that\nwe're selecting the correct name.\n\n289\n00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:42.317\nA valid name So\n\n290\n00:17:42.317 --> 00:17:44.650\nwait for that new browser to open.\n\n291\n00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:51.030\nI've signed in as Willa and\nwe'll see what happens here.\n\n292\n00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:51.650\nSo exciting.\n\n293\n00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:53.935\n>> Drum roll please.\n\n294\n00:17:53.935 --> 00:17:57.670\n>> [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n295\n00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.490\nSo can Willa view usage reports?\n\n296\n00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:09.481\nThat is the question we're\ngoing to find the answer to.\n\n297\n00:18:09.481 --> 00:18:10.028\nDenied.\n\n298\n00:18:10.028 --> 00:18:11.007\nNo.\n\n299\n00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:14.910\nAll right.\n\n300\n00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.440\nAnd let's try another way.\n\n301\n00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.564\nLet's go into Layouts.\n\n302\n00:18:25.989 --> 00:18:27.490\nI'll delete that URL.\n\n303\n00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.600\nI'll go into my server_name:port_number.\n\n304\n00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.320\nRemember you can use host headers.\n\n305\n00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.180\nSo if you just wanted a default port 80,\n\n306\n00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:38.950\nnot requiring users to enter any port\ninformation, just use a host header and\n\n307\n00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.710\nthen you set up\nthe resolution there in DNS.\n\n308\n00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:43.900\nAnd then you just don't have to\nworry about typing port numbers,\n\n309\n00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.865\nwhich tends to freak some users.\n\n310\n00:18:45.865 --> 00:18:46.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They just\n\n311\n00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:48.450\ndon't understand port numbers.\n\n312\n00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:50.910\nOkay, so that didn't work either.\n\n313\n00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.680\nAnd that's expected.\n\n314\n00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.050\nSo we're gonna go tweak\nthe permission level,\n\n315\n00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.449\nour View Usage Data permission\nlevel that we set up.\n\n316\n00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:05.900\nTo add the required permissions so that\nWilla can, in fact, view usage reports.\n\n317\n00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.650\nThat's one of those where it's supposed\nto fail, so that was successful.\n\n318\n00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.060\n>> And it's a real good example, though,\n\n319\n00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.950\nof how granular\nthe permissions are in there.\n\n320\n00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:16.890\nYou gave her this view usage statistics,\nbut yet she\n\n321\n00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.250\ncan't view the site itself, right, because\nyou've got to give her that as well.\n\n322\n00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.070\nSo, it's not like you give her\nthat view usage statistics and\n\n323\n00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.740\nit automatically picks up\nall the other permissions.\n\n324\n00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:25.510\nYou've got to go in there and\n\n325\n00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.740\ntell it what permissions you\nwant to assign to that user.\n\n326\n00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.658\n>> Right, now sometimes,\nwhen you select a granular permission,\n\n327\n00:19:30.658 --> 00:19:32.366\nothers are automatically selected.\n\n328\n00:19:32.366 --> 00:19:36.604\nBut that doesn't guarantee you've actually\nselected enough permissions to do what you\n\n329\n00:19:36.604 --> 00:19:37.170\nwanna do.\n\n330\n00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.260\nSo as Mike alluded to,\nthat's why we always test.\n\n331\n00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.200\nWe don't just assume that we\ngranted the correct permissions.\n\n332\n00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.200\nAll kinds of granular permissions\nthere as you can see,\n\n333\n00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.080\nas we've been scrolling through.\n\n334\n00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.760\nSo we always test.\n\n335\n00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.440\nLet's now look at managing permissions and\ninheritance.\n\n336\n00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:58.080\nSo, I'm gonna go into my Documents\nLibrary, and then the Files menu there.\n\n337\n00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.520\nI'm gonna click on New Folder.\n\n338\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.370\nI'm gonna call this one Reports.\n\n339\n00:20:09.595 --> 00:20:11.010\nOkay, there's our Reports folder.\n\n340\n00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:11.799\nIt appears right away.\n\n341\n00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.499\nUnder all documents.\n\n342\n00:20:19.119 --> 00:20:23.416\nNow I gotta verify that I can access that\nreports folder logged in as another user.\n\n343\n00:20:23.416 --> 00:20:26.568\nNamely Tony.\n\n344\n00:20:31.593 --> 00:20:37.768\nI'll click on Documents and\nthere it is as expected.That's good.\n\n345\n00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:44.560\nNow I'll go in as Ray.\n\n346\n00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:55.939\nRefresh there, and there's a reports\nfolder visible with Ray's credentials.\n\n347\n00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.860\nNow let's see what happens when I\ndisable permissions inheritances.\n\n348\n00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.090\nAnd at that point,\n\n349\n00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:11.370\nI have to define custom permissions\non the folder to allow for access.\n\n350\n00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:15.940\nBut it will be a different kind of access\nthat was previously granted as a child\n\n351\n00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.710\nobject to the parent object.\n\n352\n00:21:33.586 --> 00:21:34.908\nSo I'll go into reports there.\n\n353\n00:21:49.989 --> 00:21:54.147\nGood old ellipsis.\nAnd I'll click on Share.\n\n354\n00:21:57.203 --> 00:21:59.770\nAnd share again.\n\n355\n00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:06.380\nAnd then click on advance, there's another\noption to get to advance a little sooner.\n\n356\n00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.240\nSo again like many things,\n\n357\n00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.400\nMicrosoft has different ways to\naccomplish the exact same task.\n\n358\n00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:15.309\nNow up on the ribbon here, going to\nclick on stop inheriting permissions.\n\n359\n00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.250\nAnd a warning.\n\n360\n00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.210\nAgain, just like we would get.\n\n361\n00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:25.360\nVery similar if we were disabling\na inheritance in an NTFS folder structure\n\n362\n00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.770\nwith a subfolder.\n\n363\n00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:27.390\nWe get a warning.\n\n364\n00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:31.930\nYou're about to essentially divorce\nthe parent or unlink, if you will.\n\n365\n00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.539\nStop inheriting permissions\nfrom the parent.\n\n366\n00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:40.260\nAnd now it shows in the gold bar near the\ntop, this folder has unique permissions.\n\n367\n00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:49.590\nI'm also gonna remove user permissions\nusing that button on the ribbon there.\n\n368\n00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.520\nNow I'm all powerful.\n\n369\n00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.980\nI can remove permissions.\n\n370\n00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.160\nI taketh away and I grant.\n\n371\n00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:55.730\nSo I'm going to give permissions now.\n\n372\n00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:58.821\nWith.\n\n373\n00:22:58.821 --> 00:23:03.619\nRay.\nClick on Show Options and I can choose\n\n374\n00:23:03.619 --> 00:23:09.207\na permission level to\nassign things like read or\n\n375\n00:23:09.207 --> 00:23:13.694\ndesign or full control permissions.\n\n376\n00:23:13.694 --> 00:23:18.473\nWith Ray.\n\n377\n00:23:18.473 --> 00:23:19.923\nClick on Share.\n\n378\n00:23:38.355 --> 00:23:43.633\nAnd let's verify that site members can\nsee the folder with custom permissions.\n\n379\n00:23:56.308 --> 00:23:57.882\nClick Refresh.\n\n380\n00:24:04.823 --> 00:24:07.514\nOkay, so with Tony there moments ago,\n\n381\n00:24:07.514 --> 00:24:11.033\nwe did not see the reports folder and\nwith Ray we do.\n\n382\n00:24:11.033 --> 00:24:12.311\nSo that's expected behavior.\n\n383\n00:24:20.246 --> 00:24:21.964\nLet's go on as Nelly.\n\n384\n00:24:26.817 --> 00:24:27.758\nTakes a while to load up.\n\n385\n00:24:46.402 --> 00:24:50.983\nNow, Nelly's a non-authorized user and\nas expected we got a message,\n\n386\n00:24:50.983 --> 00:24:54.170\nsorry this site has not\nbeen shared with you.\n\n387\n00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:57.095\nNow, that's somewhat useful but\nnot totally useful.\n\n388\n00:24:57.095 --> 00:25:00.040\nWouldn't it be great to have a way that\nthe user when seeing this message could\n\n389\n00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.790\nrequest access?\n\n390\n00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:02.730\nLet's see how to do that.\n\n391\n00:25:04.287 --> 00:25:09.329\nSo we're gonna enable access requests for\nour Acme team site.\n\n392\n00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:14.840\n>> Here's a nice feature here.\n\n393\n00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.980\nIt allows somebody to, rather than them\nto have to try to figure out who it\n\n394\n00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.960\nis they're supposed to ask, go through the\nprocedure of either shooting off an email,\n\n395\n00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.640\nor going and finding them or\ngetting them on the phone.\n\n396\n00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.660\nRight here on the page when it tells them,\nyou don't have access,\n\n397\n00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.060\nwe give them a link and they can fire\noff an email to the appropriate person.\n\n398\n00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.940\nThey don't even have to know, do they?\n\n399\n00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.280\n>> Exactly, no they don't have to know.\n\n400\n00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.704\nSo up in the ribbon there's\nAccess Requests Settings,\n\n401\n00:25:38.704 --> 00:25:42.050\nthen I click on Allow Access Requests.\n\n402\n00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:45.420\nAnd now you would have had to set up your\nemail settings in the farm level first or\n\n403\n00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.890\nelse that checkbox will be dark and\n\n404\n00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:49.050\nyou won't be able to type\nan email in that field.\n\n405\n00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:54.630\nAnd now, so I've enabled access requests.\n\n406\n00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:59.450\nSo let's see what happens when Nelly,\ngo back in as.\n\n407\n00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:00.970\nThere's Putin again.\n\n408\n00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:02.592\nCan't rid of that guy.\n\n409\n00:26:02.592 --> 00:26:04.670\n[LAUGH] All right, I'll go back in.\n\n410\n00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:10.220\nEventually if I can get to\ninto my Internet Explorer.\n\n411\n00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.755\nLet me out!\n\n412\n00:26:12.755 --> 00:26:15.088\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Aha!\n\n413\n00:26:15.088 --> 00:26:18.687\nFamiliar task bar, thank goodness, okay.\n\n414\n00:26:18.687 --> 00:26:23.111\nAll right, and,\n\n415\n00:26:26.152 --> 00:26:29.740\nNow there's a little field\nthere I can type in.\n\n416\n00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.320\nI have to type in some characters.\n\n417\n00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:36.390\nI can't just send request, in other words,\nsome rationale for why I deserve access,\n\n418\n00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:40.190\nor why I need it, which I'm not\ngonna provide cuz I'm a Refusenik.\n\n419\n00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:41.250\nSo I'll say, please allow access.\n\n420\n00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.980\nThen the send request button becomes\nvisible cuz I've typed some characters\n\n421\n00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.120\nin that field.\n\n422\n00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.363\nAnd you can see the wheel\nspinning on the tab.\n\n423\n00:26:54.237 --> 00:26:55.074\nStill spinning.\n\n424\n00:26:59.613 --> 00:27:02.435\nOkay, so now it says awaiting approval.\n\n425\n00:27:02.435 --> 00:27:04.125\nWe'll let you know about any updates.\n\n426\n00:27:04.125 --> 00:27:08.921\nAnd then I can further harass whoever's\nsupposed to let me in if I want by typing\n\n427\n00:27:08.921 --> 00:27:10.065\nit again.\n\n428\n00:27:10.065 --> 00:27:11.745\nBut that would be rude.\n\n429\n00:27:11.745 --> 00:27:12.835\nSo let's see what happens.\n\n430\n00:27:12.835 --> 00:27:13.755\nHow do I approve?\n\n431\n00:27:13.755 --> 00:27:18.675\nAs a site collection admin,\nhow do I approve an access request?\n\n432\n00:27:18.675 --> 00:27:23.600\nWell, I'll go back into access\nrequest settings on my ribbon, and\n\n433\n00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.300\nnow notice how there's a new option\nthere under users and permissions called\n\n434\n00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:33.130\nAccess Requests and Invitations.\n\n435\n00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:35.430\nAnd, actually I, so I went in as Willa,\n\n436\n00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:37.820\nnot as Nellie cause I had\nanother browser window open.\n\n437\n00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.210\nBut the same principal applies, right?\n\n438\n00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:43.920\nNow Willa wants request, so Nellie\nwould have done the exact same thing.\n\n439\n00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.010\nNow the approve button,\nannoyingly is grayed out.\n\n440\n00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:48.900\nSo I must be missing something here.\n\n441\n00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:50.716\nWhat am I missing?\n\n442\n00:27:50.716 --> 00:27:55.740\nI put in OK, so I've replied and\n\n443\n00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.655\nstill I can't approve.\n\n444\n00:27:59.655 --> 00:28:04.438\nSo I will close out of\nthat little dialog there.\n\n445\n00:28:04.438 --> 00:28:09.280\nNo, that's not gonna work.\n\n446\n00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:15.432\nWhat if I go over here to\nthe good old ellipses?\n\n447\n00:28:15.432 --> 00:28:17.110\nSo that's what it's missing.\n\n448\n00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:20.270\nI have to set a permission level first.\n\n449\n00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:23.770\nWhich is good because this way rather\nthan just approving access and\n\n450\n00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:26.630\nmaybe it's full control,\npossibly by default.\n\n451\n00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:31.290\nThis way there is no default forcing me\nas an approver to think through, okay,\n\n452\n00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:32.855\nwhat kind of access am I granting?\n\n453\n00:28:32.855 --> 00:28:37.620\nWilla, I'll give it read, I mean, that's a\ngood default if you're not entirely sure.\n\n454\n00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:41.220\nWe need to check on something, maybe they\ndeserve a higher permission level, but for\n\n455\n00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.070\nnow, read.\n\n456\n00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:45.820\nAnd now I'm back in as Willa,\n\n457\n00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:51.060\nI will refresh and now I have access.\n\n458\n00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:51.640\n>> Voila.\n\n459\n00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.528\n>> And the angels sing.\n\n460\n00:28:52.528 --> 00:28:56.430\n>> All right Bart, great look there\nat all different permissions and\n\n461\n00:28:56.430 --> 00:29:00.510\nsettings that we have to control\nwhat users have access to the site.\n\n462\n00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:03.610\nAnd then what access they have\nonce they get to the site,\n\n463\n00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:06.210\nas well as denying some permissions.\n\n464\n00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:09.890\nWe also took a look at how we could block\ninheritance from one site to the other.\n\n465\n00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:12.180\nRemember when you have a parent site and\na child site,\n\n466\n00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.150\nit works like NTFS permissions,\n\n467\n00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:17.500\nyou wanna set them at the highest level\nthat's convenient, take advantage of that.\n\n468\n00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:21.018\nThere are gonna be times when that child\nsite needs separate permissions from\n\n469\n00:29:21.018 --> 00:29:23.629\nthe parent objects, and so\nyou just block inheritance.\n\n470\n00:29:23.629 --> 00:29:26.319\nWell, I call it block inheritance,\nright, like we're used to with NTFS.\n\n471\n00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:28.950\nBasically the same concept.\n\n472\n00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:30.980\nAnd then you can set custom and\npermissions on that site.\n\n473\n00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.190\nAnd then if that site had a child site\nthey would still inherit down from that\n\n474\n00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.810\npoint on, but of course you could\nblock them down there as well.\n\n475\n00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:40.220\nSo, really cool stuff Mark,\nappreciate those fantastic demos.\n\n476\n00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:43.240\nReally getting to take a look at\nwhat's going on there in SharePoint.\n\n477\n00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:47.360\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching\nas much as we enjoyed shooting this one.\n\n478\n00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.830\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n479\n00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:50.479\n>> And I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n480\n00:29:50.479 --> 00:29:52.801\n>> And

00:00:20.310\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.690\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.570\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\nconfiguring our federated authentication.\n\n6\n00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.510\nReally, we've talked about authentication\nwithin SharePoint, within our sites and\n\n7\n00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.540\nthings like that.\n\n8\n00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.050\nBut now, we wanna take a look at,\n\n9\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.520\nwhat if we wanna give access to\npeople outside of our organization?\n\n10\n00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.090\nThey don't have an account\nmaybe in Active Directory.\n\n11\n00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.540\nThis could be a contractor or it could be\nanother organization that we wanna give\n\n12\n00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.340\naccess to maybe a partner organization,\nyou know something like that.\n\n13\n00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.760\nSo, we're gonna take a look at that and\n\n14\n00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.180\nhere to guide us through this process is\nMr. Mark Ingram, how's it going Mark?\n\n15\n00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.360\n>> Mike.\nThanks very much, yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.860\nSo, let's dig in in the nitty gritty,\n\n17\n00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.810\nit's quite technical providing\naccess to that partner organization.\n\n18\n00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.850\nAnd there's a trust relationship that\nneeds to be configured on each side.\n\n19\n00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.280\nSo let's get right down to it.\n\n20\n00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.840\nSo I'm in my partner\norganization domain and\n\n21\n00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.010\nI'm gonna use\nActive Directory Federation Services,\n\n22\n00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.980\ngood old ADFS, and it brings up\nthe console there with a few nodes.\n\n23\n00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.010\nMaybe familiar to some of you.\n\n24\n00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.575\nSo, the first thing is to\ncreate a relying party trust.\n\n25\n00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:34.455\nAnd I can enter that info in manually.\n\n26\n00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:35.870\nAlways fun.\n\n27\n00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.286\n>> Good times.\n\n28\n00:01:37.286 --> 00:01:40.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Great thing about this is\n\n29\n00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.820\nyou can export a lot of this and\n\n30\n00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.420\ngive it to your partner organization and\nthey can import it on their side.\n\n31\n00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.750\n>> Indeed.\n\n32\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.490\nIt's one of these things that you do so\n\n33\n00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.330\nrarely that you definitely\nwant to have a checklist.\n\n34\n00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.020\nDon't try and do this from memory.\n\n35\n00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.300\nThat could lead to grief or\nat least wasted time.\n\n36\n00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.816\nSo, I'm gonna call this\nthe display name Acme SP,\n\n37\n00:02:05.094 --> 00:02:09.844\nAnd there's a legacy EDFS 1.0 and\n1.1 profiles, but\n\n38\n00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:15.580\nI can use the more modern ADFS profile,\nwhich we were just SAML 2.0.\n\n39\n00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.540\nSecurity Association Markup Language.\n\n40\n00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.491\nI'm not going to include a token\nencryption certificate but\n\n41\n00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:30.716\nif I was going to, I'd specify browse and\nthen browse to that certificate.\n\n42\n00:02:39.382 --> 00:02:44.947\nAnd next, I'm gonna enter the URL\nafter checking the checkbox here,\n\n43\n00:02:44.947 --> 00:02:49.485\nenable support for\nthe WS Federation passive protocol.\n\n44\n00:02:49.485 --> 00:02:51.998\nTop one will give you a little\nexample URL down there.\n\n45\n00:02:51.998 --> 00:02:55.274\nSo choosing\n\n46\n00:02:55.274 --> 00:03:06.085\nhttps://spo13333/_trust\n\n47\n00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:12.635\nand not question mark,\n\n48\n00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:16.570\nit's slash.\n\n49\n00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.240\nSo it's very important to put\nthe trailing slash in not just here.\n\n50\n00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.280\nBut a lot of the times with dialogue\nboxes with Microsoft you might just omit\n\n51\n00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.010\nthat thing.\n\n52\n00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.980\nIt's not necessary, but it often is.\n\n53\n00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.290\nSo need that trailing slash.\n\n54\n00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.170\n>> Really indicates the directories\nunderneath this URL\n\n55\n00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.690\nrather than just this URL.\n\n56\n00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.490\n>> And, next I need to specify URN,\nwhich will be\n\n57\n00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.880\nthe environment I'm connecting to,\nwhich is Acme, and\n\n58\n00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.920\nthen the server name, port number.\n\n59\n00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.460\nI could enable multi-factor\nauthentication.\n\n60\n00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.420\nA little paranoia is good.\n\n61\n00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.254\nBut I'm not going to for\nthe purposes of this demo.\n\n62\n00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.107\nThat's certainly something\nMicrosoft's getting more into,\n\n63\n00:04:09.107 --> 00:04:11.970\nis the multi-factor authentication,\nwith Windows Hello.\n\n64\n00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.599\nSo we've gone way beyond smart cards now.\n\n65\n00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.200\nAnd I'm now ready to add the trust and\nthere is a dialog box it's gonna open by\n\n66\n00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.140\ndefault when I click on close that's the\nedit claim rules dialog and there it is.\n\n67\n00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:35.190\nFew tabs here, I'm interested in the first\ntab there the issuance transform rule.\n\n68\n00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.530\nAnd I choose a template.\n\n69\n00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.930\nAnd in fact I'll leave the default there.\n\n70\n00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.470\nWe're just setting it l-dat\nattributes as claims.\n\n71\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.160\nSo we have to map the relying\nparty to the party that wants\n\n72\n00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.249\naccess in terms of l-dat attributes.\n\n73\n00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.695\nSo, I'll give this claim rule a name,\nwhich will be Acme SharePoint Claim Rule.\n\n74\n00:05:01.761 --> 00:05:04.390\nAnd I can use Active Directory\nas my attribute storage but\n\n75\n00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.990\nany l-dat directory would work.\n\n76\n00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.683\n>> Right.\n>> You might be using some other third\n\n77\n00:05:07.683 --> 00:05:10.980\nparty l-dat directory,\nthat's totally acceptable.\n\n78\n00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.320\nYou could see the variety of the l-dat\nattributes that can be used.\n\n79\n00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.039\nI'm gonna choose Sam account name.\n\n80\n00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.130\nAnd that would be mapped two.\n\n81\n00:05:23.421 --> 00:05:25.789\nRight at the top there, email address.\n\n82\n00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.990\nAnother l-dat attribute will be right\nat the bottom, user principle name.\n\n83\n00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.370\nAnd that will map to UPN.\n\n84\n00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.950\nI could add more mappings if I want.\n\n85\n00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.420\nBut I don't.\n\n86\n00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.080\nSo, notice there's room for\nother rules as well.\n\n87\n00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.220\nBut I just need that one rule.\n\n88\n00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.610\nSo, I'm good to go.\n\n89\n00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.770\nNow I'm going to expand the service\nnode in my ADFS console.\n\n90\n00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.670\nI go into certificates.\n\n91\n00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.240\nYou can see three different\nkinds of certificates, here.\n\n92\n00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.610\nOne for service communications,\none for token decrypting, but\n\n93\n00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.020\nI'm interested in the token\nsigning certificate right now.\n\n94\n00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.310\nI'm gonna click on View Certificate.\n\n95\n00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.310\nThis is a certificate I'm going to copy,\nand I do that from the Details tab.\n\n96\n00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.970\nA copy of file, and gonna export it,\nusing the default format which is X509.\n\n97\n00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.244\nAnd I will browse.\n\n98\n00:06:28.051 --> 00:06:31.310\nStick it on the desktop for convenience.\n\n99\n00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.959\nGive it a name.\n\n100\n00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.305\nOf my environment here\nwhich is monorail so\n\n101\n00:06:39.305 --> 00:06:44.220\nthey call it monorail\ntoken signing.CER and\n\n102\n00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.340\nthe export was successful.\n\n103\n00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.742\nAlways a good sign.\n\n104\n00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:53.606\nAnd Iâm done with that certificates\ndialogs so I can close that as well.\n\n105\n00:06:53.606 --> 00:06:56.743\nAnd I'm done with ADFS.\n\n106\n00:06:56.743 --> 00:06:57.671\nNow what.\n\n107\n00:06:57.671 --> 00:07:00.514\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, File Explorer,\n\n108\n00:07:00.514 --> 00:07:05.690\nlets copy that over to\nthe relying party environment.\n\n109\n00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.430\nAnd I will do that.\n\n110\n00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.160\nActually, I did that earlier,\nI do confess.\n\n111\n00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.305\nIt was already there.\n\n112\n00:07:17.305 --> 00:07:18.581\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But\n\n113\n00:07:18.581 --> 00:07:21.690\nonly just before this occasion.\n\n114\n00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.033\nYou can tell by the date if\nyou're monitoring the date.\n\n115\n00:07:25.033 --> 00:07:28.070\nAll right.\n\n116\n00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.580\nSometimes it's a hassle to paste over and\nget the share information accurate, etc.\n\n117\n00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.610\nSo I spared you that experience on my end.\n\n118\n00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:35.180\nAll right.\n\n119\n00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.450\n>> Yeah, real world we might be\nusing email to transmit this to\n\n120\n00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.240\na partner organization.\n\n121\n00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.243\n>> Right, I almost did that actually.\n\n122\n00:07:42.243 --> 00:07:43.359\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> To myself.\n\n123\n00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:46.180\n[LAUGH] I thought,\nthere's got to be a better way.\n\n124\n00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:51.320\nI didn't want to be defeated by\na simple share between forests.\n\n125\n00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:51.858\nAll right.\n\n126\n00:07:51.858 --> 00:07:55.282\nSo, I'm gonna declare a variable now,\nwhich is Cert.\n\n127\n00:07:55.282 --> 00:07:57.313\nView object.\n\n128\n00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:10.765\nA lot of typing this way.\n\n129\n00:08:10.765 --> 00:08:12.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n130\n00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:17.042\nthis is about things difficult\ndown here It will be.\n\n131\n00:08:17.042 --> 00:08:27.042\nSystem.security.cryptography.\n\n132\n00:08:35.366 --> 00:08:37.893\nX09.\n\n133\n00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:40.340\nX509 certificates, rather.\n\n134\n00:08:44.047 --> 00:08:46.038\nYou can see why you don't\nwant to memorize this stuff.\n\n135\n00:08:46.038 --> 00:08:46.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean, if you have\n\n136\n00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.110\na photographic memory, great, but\nit's far better for something, like I say,\n\n137\n00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.050\nyou're gonna do once probably,\nor once every few years.\n\n138\n00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.695\nUse a checklist, don't try and\nbe a hero and pull it off from memory.\n\n139\n00:08:55.695 --> 00:08:58.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] There's no benefit.\n\n140\n00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.670\nSo .X509Certificate2, and then I have to\n\n141\n00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.410\nspecify the share where\nthe certificate is.\n\n142\n00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:12.230\nWhich is in C.\n\n143\n00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:25.462\nAnd that's Monorail Research,\nmonorail sign rather dot CER,\n\n144\n00:09:25.462 --> 00:09:30.906\nso this is what happens when\nyou forget to use a double\n\n145\n00:09:30.906 --> 00:09:38.140\nquote which I did before the C\nthere where it says C colon share.\n\n146\n00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.080\nSo I threw that in and then now it works.\n\n147\n00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.400\nThat time.\n\n148\n00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.860\nSo if you get a command prompt\nthat is not a command prompt,\n\n149\n00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.450\nits two chevrons then you know\nyou typically missed a bracket or\n\n150\n00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:54.870\nquote at the beginning or\nend of some part of what you just typed.\n\n151\n00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.670\nNext up is to use the new SP trusted\nroot authority command line.\n\n152\n00:10:05.025 --> 00:10:10.137\nNow the name will be\nMonorail ADFS Token Signing.\n\n153\n00:10:11.992 --> 00:10:16.945\nCertificate I'll use is\nthe one call that variable\n\n154\n00:10:16.945 --> 00:10:22.260\ndollar sign cert\n>> So basically we're setting up a trust.\n\n155\n00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.790\nWe're importing their certificate\nto our trusted root so\n\n156\n00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.720\nthat we trust certificates signed by\ntheir public key infrastructure, right?\n\n157\n00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.520\nBecause we've got two separate companies,\ntwo separate PKIs.\n\n158\n00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.095\n>> Right.\nNext up, we're gonna map incoming claims\n\n159\n00:10:38.095 --> 00:10:42.453\nto SharePoint claims So\n\n160\n00:10:42.453 --> 00:10:46.158\nif we call the claim\nmapping we set up earlier,\n\n161\n00:10:46.158 --> 00:10:50.539\nwe're gonna make this more\nformal arrangement here.\n\n162\n00:10:50.539 --> 00:10:55.540\nSo $email claimmapping equals\nusp claim typemapping.\n\n163\n00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.912\nAnd then we specify\nthe incoming claim type.\n\n164\n00:11:02.146 --> 00:11:03.410\nUse that parameter.\n\n165\n00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:15.640\nIt's

think the standard would have\nbeen upgraded since 2005 of May,\n\n169\n00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.880\nbut it's robust it doesn't need to.\n\n170\n00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.460\n>> I guess so.\n\n171\n00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.049\n>> Slash e-mail address, so\nthat's one of the parameters we mapped.\n\n172\n00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.879\nAnd, incoming claim type display name.\n\n173\n00:11:46.863 --> 00:11:50.570\nGuess I could be using tab complete here?\n\n174\n00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.543\nMaybe I'm a glutton for punishment.\n\n175\n00:11:52.543 --> 00:11:53.969\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n176\n00:11:53.969 --> 00:11:55.714\n>> That will be email address.\n\n177\n00:11:56.803 --> 00:11:59.542\n>> And so this is very similar\nto setting up a federation,\n\n178\n00:11:59.542 --> 00:12:01.220\noutside of SharePoint, right?\n\n179\n00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.230\nYou've got two organizations\nWe're going to share claims.\n\n180\n00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:08.210\nWell what they call one thing might not be\nthe same as what we call it on our end.\n\n181\n00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:09.470\nSo we're really creating that mapping.\n\n182\n00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:14.040\nSo when the claim comes over and\nit says Sam Account Name,\n\n183\n00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.710\nour organization might use that or\naccept that as an email address.\n\n184\n00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.919\nAlright, so we're just making sure we're\nboth talking the same language, basically.\n\n185\n00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:32.370\n>> Use u pin claim mapping all that we'll\nfind is u s p claim type mapping, incoming\n\n186\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:41.690\nclaim type Of that same standard,\n\n187\n00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.426\nI guess I could have copied from\nthe previous one but whatever.\n\n188\n00:12:44.426 --> 00:12:47.100\nSo https://shcemas.xml .org.\n\n189\n00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:55.040\nBut at the very end here we're using upn.\n\n190\n00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.802\nSo the first one was email address,\nnow upn.\n\n191\n00:12:59.765 --> 00:13:02.730\nAnd the incoming display name.\n\n192\n00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.630\nWill be UPN as you might have guessed.\n\n193\n00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:08.630\nThe same as incoming.\n\n194\n00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.310\nSo now weve mapped incoming\nclaims to SharePoint claims.\n\n195\n00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:20.270\nThe next step is to register ADFS as\na trusted provider in SharePoint.\n\n196\n00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.389\nSo im going to find a REM variable.\n\n197\n00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:32.859\nThe URN of, This will be Acme.\n\n198\n00:13:41.729 --> 00:13:46.662\nAnd use my SPO1, and\n\n199\n00:13:46.662 --> 00:13:53.530\nmy five-digit port number.\n\n200\n00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:54.210\nThat's the realm.\n\n201\n00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.090\nAnd, now the sign-in url.\n\n202\n00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.630\nI'll define that variable.\n\n203\n00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:03.538\nAnd, that will\n\n204\n00:14:03.538 --> 00:14:07.695\nbe https//\n\n205\n00:14:10.147 --> 00:14:16.019\nSo the SPO1, SPO2\n\n206\n00:14:16.019 --> 00:14:21.098\nrather .monorail,\n\n207\n00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:29.620\n.nest /adfs /ls.\n\n208\n00:14:34.299 --> 00:14:38.361\nAnd now, we'll set up the new SP\ntrusted identity token issuer.\n\n209\n00:14:38.361 --> 00:14:39.090\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n210\n00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:40.035\n>> How's that for a commandlet?\n\n211\n00:14:40.035 --> 00:14:44.340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Thank goodness for tab complete.\n\n212\n00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.147\nThis will be called.\n\n213\n00:14:46.147 --> 00:14:50.988\nMonorail ADFS.\n\n214\n00:15:01.205 --> 00:15:03.248\nAnd I'll give it a description.\n\n215\n00:15:07.103 --> 00:15:10.051\nWhich is the ADFS deployment.\n\n216\n00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:17.870\nWhoops, deployment@monorail.\n\n217\n00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:21.300\nI'll use the realm parameter here.\n\n218\n00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.500\nThe variable I defined earlier.\n\n219\n00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:29.210\nAnd then I'll use the import\ntrust certificate\n\n220\n00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:33.640\nusing the cert variable\nI declared earlier.\n\n221\n00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:40.439\nAnd then claims mappings.\n\n222\n00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:48.176\nBe the, dollar sign, email, claim mapping.\n\n223\n00:15:48.176 --> 00:15:53.268\nAnd, Need to do,\n\n224\n00:15:53.268 --> 00:15:56.474\nand then, UPN claim mapping.\n\n225\n00:15:56.474 --> 00:16:01.623\nAnd sign in URL, which\n\n226\n00:16:01.623 --> 00:16:08.128\nis the sign in URL variable,\n\n227\n00:16:08.128 --> 00:16:15.446\nand then the identifier claim,\n\n228\n00:16:15.446 --> 00:16:21.680\nwill be email claim mapping\n\n229\n00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.056\ninput claim type.\n\n230\n00:16:26.056 --> 00:16:30.030\nOkay, that command completed,\nnow we have some more configuration to do\n\n231\n00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.540\nin the central admin site\nof our relying party.\n\n232\n00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:37.290\nThe relying party is the domain of the\nSharePoint environment with the goodies\n\n233\n00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:41.390\nthat are being shared out, so\nwe have to create externet zone.\n\n234\n00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:45.450\nRemember zone is a vector\nthat's other users or\n\n235\n00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:48.380\npopulations can access the same content.\n\n236\n00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:52.140\nSo, I would use an intranet zone, if I'm\nin the company, I might setup another\n\n237\n00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.710\nzone, an externet zone for\na supplier or partner to come in and\n\n238\n00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:01.150\naccess the content in a restricted way and\nwe'll see what that looks like right now.\n\n239\n00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:08.130\nOkay, so now I'm central admin\nof my relying party farm,\n\n240\n00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.730\nand I gonna click on\nManage Web Applications, and\n\n241\n00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.820\nthen my SharePoint quintuple three.\n\n242\n00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:21.930\nI clicked on the extend button,\nso we're extending access.\n\n243\n00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:23.565\nThink of it that way.\n\n244\n00:17:23.565 --> 00:17:26.908\nSo I'll create a new IS website\n\n245\n00:17:29.068 --> 00:17:34.362\nTo serve up the content to\nour partner organization.\n\n246\n00:17:34.362 --> 00:17:38.507\nI'll give it a port number of 55556.\n\n247\n00:17:38.507 --> 00:17:41.109\n>> Can it keep it separate from maybe\nwhat we're using internally and\n\n248\n00:17:41.109 --> 00:17:42.650\nthings like that?\n\n249\n00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.760\n>> Yeah, it's a different\nway to access the content.\n\n250\n00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.609\nSo in other words, the partner on\nthe externet, they would go to\n\n251\n00:17:49.609 --> 00:17:54.120\na different site to authenticate and\nstill be accessing the same content.\n\n252\n00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.670\n>> Right, cuz as you say we don't\nhave to duplicate the content,\n\n253\n00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.740\njust different ways in.\n\n254\n00:17:58.740 --> 00:17:59.590\n>> Exactly?\n\n255\n00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:04.561\nAnd then we gonna apply restrictions to\nthe entire web app for example read-only.\n\n256\n00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:11.735\nOkay, so now I'm gonna choose\nAuthentication Providers, and\n\n257\n00:18:11.735 --> 00:18:16.638\nthere is my externet zone I just\nset up and I scroll down here.\n\n258\n00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:19.910\nA little more.\n\n259\n00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.550\nAnd there's my, I'm gonna click\non trusted identity provider.\n\n260\n00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:28.700\nSo in other words, we're trusting\nthe monorail partner entity.\n\n261\n00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.920\nWe're trusting their\nauthentication mechanism.\n\n262\n00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.460\nSo if someone presents a claim\nthat has been authenticated\n\n263\n00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.525\nfrom the partner organization,\nwe trust that.\n\n264\n00:18:37.525 --> 00:18:38.025\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n265\n00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.606\n>> All right.\nNow I'm gonna add,\n\n266\n00:18:40.606 --> 00:18:42.697\nI'm going into a externet here.\n\n267\n00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.352\nNot gonna add users.\n\n268\n00:18:47.352 --> 00:18:48.536\nActually, I'll browse.\n\n269\n00:18:50.731 --> 00:18:53.590\nI can see there, there's my Monorail ADFS.\n\n270\n00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.260\nPeople in groups, I'll select that.\n\n271\n00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:58.700\nActually, I'll go this way.\n\n272\n00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.380\nI'll go all users, and then click all\nusers from the partner organization\n\n273\n00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:06.625\nmonorail, and click the Add button\nnear the bottom of the screen, and\n\n274\n00:19:06.625 --> 00:19:11.670\nOK, and here's where I can control\nwhat kind of access they have.\n\n275\n00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.030\nI'll say full read, so\nthey can't make any changes but\n\n276\n00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.675\nwe're saying they can read that content.\n\n277\n00:19:15.675 --> 00:19:16.214\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n278\n00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.181\n>> And okay.\n\n279\n00:19:19.181 --> 00:19:19.782\n>> All right, Mark.\n\n280\n00:19:19.782 --> 00:19:21.720\nAnother one of those great\ndemonstrations there.\n\n281\n00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.610\nReally taking a look at how we can\nprovide access to our SharePoint farm or\n\n282\n00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.820\nsites from another organization.\n\n283\n00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.471\nThis case a partner organization like,\nI think you called it Monorail.\n\n284\n00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:36.099\nBut it could be any partner\norganization or even contractors,\n\n285\n00:19:36.099 --> 00:19:39.386\nvendors, things like that,\nthat we wanna give access or\n\n286\n00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:43.915\ncontent even though they do not have\nan account with this in active directory.\n\n287\n00:19:43.915 --> 00:19:48.075\nThank you for that demonstrating that for\nus, hope everybody out there enjoyed\n\n288\n00:19:48.075 --> 00:19:51.310\nwatching signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n289\n00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:52.020\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n290\n00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:58.932\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n291\n00:19:58.932 --> 00:20:00.328\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:23.560\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.950\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be focusing in on security.\n\n5\n00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.810\nWe wanna take a look at\nfarm level security, so\n\n6\n00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.580\nour entire SharePoint organization right,\nthe farm,\n\n7\n00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.250\nas well as the underlying platform in\na way because that's just as important.\n\n8\n00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.260\nObviously, we've talked in other\nepisodes about how to harden the server\n\n9\n00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.320\noperating system itself, but\nit is something worth mentioning, right?\n\n10\n00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.700\nWe've gotta make sure that if there's\na vulnerability in the underlying\n\n11\n00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.670\noperating system,\n\n12\n00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.950\ndoesn't matter how much you secure your\nfarm, still gonna be an avenue of attack.\n\n13\n00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.020\nSo here to help us figure all\nthis out is Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n14\n00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.810\nHow's it going, Mark?\n\n15\n00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.300\n>> Good Mike, thanks very much.\n\n16\n00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.440\nAll right, let's dive into it.\n\n17\n00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.400\nWe're gonna look at blocking file types.\n\n18\n00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.390\nSo maybe you have not sure your\ncurrent file server environment.\n\n19\n00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.550\nYou may have some kind of restrictions as\nto the kind of content users can upload or\n\n20\n00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.860\nquite too often frankly,\nit could be a free for all.\n\n21\n00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.600\nWith no quotas whatsoever and\n\n22\n00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.510\njust the purchase orders to acquire more\nstorage when the old storage fills up.\n\n23\n00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.410\nThat's not a best practice, but that\nis the reality for many organizations.\n\n24\n00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.110\nThey don't wanna be boxed in.\n\n25\n00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.710\nSo let's start fresh\nif that's the case for\n\n26\n00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.460\nyou in your environment with SharePoint.\n\n27\n00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.220\nLet us restrict the kinds of content,\nthe file types users can upload.\n\n28\n00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.940\nNo, you can't upload your\nCarol Burnett collection of DVDs for\n\n29\n00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.030\nsafe keeping on the SharePoint server.\n\n30\n00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.460\nSo how can we do this?\n\n31\n00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.860\nLet's dive into the interface here,\nand we go into Manage Web Applications\n\n32\n00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.590\nand my particular web app,\nmy SharePoint quintuple three.\n\n33\n00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.280\nAnd I'm gonna click on Blocked File Types\nup there in the ribbon.\n\n34\n00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.650\nAnd there's just a few\nalready pre-populated.\n\n35\n00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.178\nWho knows what some of\nthose extensions are?\n\n36\n00:02:07.178 --> 00:02:11.020\nZamix, that sounds like\na pharmaceutical product.\n\n37\n00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.041\n>> Right?\n[LAUGH]\n\n38\n00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:12.900\n>> [LAUGH] Now,\n\n39\n00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.560\nthese aren't alphabetized so I strongly\nrecommend that you insert the new blocked\n\n40\n00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.610\nfile type, if you're going to enter any,\nin alphabetical order.\n\n41\n00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.810\nIt makes parsing much easier if\nyou have to troubleshoot, for\n\n42\n00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.600\nexample, why you're not\ngetting the expected behavior.\n\n43\n00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.090\nEither people are uploading when they\nshouldn't or you're blocking a file type\n\n44\n00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.970\nlike docx for example that is totally\nlegitimate and should be allowed.\n\n45\n00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.840\nSo by alphabetizing,\n\n46\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.240\ncuz this list can get very long,\nmakes it easier to troubleshoot.\n\n47\n00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.450\nAll right, so\nI've entered a couple file types there.\n\n48\n00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.670\nAnd now, let's see the impact of that.\n\n49\n00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.710\nAnd we go to my Acme Team Site, and\nI'm gonna go into Site Contents here.\n\n50\n00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.650\nScroll down a bit and\nI'm looking for Site Assets.\n\n51\n00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.870\nSo I'll add that.\n\n52\n00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.835\nAnd let's see what happens\nwhen I click on New,\n\n53\n00:03:04.835 --> 00:03:09.688\nand see if I can upload\na particular file type.\n\n54\n00:03:12.952 --> 00:03:15.436\nWhich I've conveniently\nlocated in the root of C.\n\n55\n00:03:15.436 --> 00:03:21.537\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's access that,\n\n56\n00:03:21.537 --> 00:03:24.500\nso I got a couple of,\nI got a JPEG and a bitmap here.\n\n57\n00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.940\nLet's see if I can upload the bitmap.\n\n58\n00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.758\nPlace your bets.\n\n59\n00:03:27.758 --> 00:03:31.091\nNo, denied.\n\n60\n00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:36.720\nAs expected, because we specifically\nlisted BMP as a blocked file type.\n\n61\n00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.930\nIt's good that it's highlighted there\nin a little pink background, just so\n\n62\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.180\nit's really obvious to the user.\n\n63\n00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.430\nThat didn't work, I should look at this.\n\n64\n00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.660\nOkay, blocked file type.\n\n65\n00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.180\nAnd then, if you have a legitimate\nreason for uploading that file site,\n\n66\n00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.835\nthen you can harass your site\ncollection administrator.\n\n67\n00:03:50.835 --> 00:03:52.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And they can grant permissions to you.\n\n68\n00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.723\nOkay, let's go back\ninto site contents now.\n\n69\n00:04:11.448 --> 00:04:12.480\nSite Assets.\n\n70\n00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:22.510\nSo the word app gets thrown\naround a lot nowadays.\n\n71\n00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.879\nWhat used to be just sorta site elements,\nnow we're calling them apps.\n\n72\n00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.920\nIt can be a little confusing.\n\n73\n00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.602\nWe're gonna go into Browse and\nI'm gonna try uploading shades of blue,\n\n74\n00:04:31.602 --> 00:04:32.990\nwhich is a JPEG file.\n\n75\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.870\nAnd success, why?\n\n76\n00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.144\nBecause it was not a blocked file type.\n\n77\n00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:43.090\nYou can see there it says modified\na few seconds ago, so that's good.\n\n78\n00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.390\nIt's always good when these\ndemos work as expected.\n\n79\n00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.340\nNow I'm gonna edit this page.\n\n80\n00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.640\nLet's look at some web part security here.\n\n81\n00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.785\nSo, don't freak out if you're not familiar\nwith FrontPage back in the day or\n\n82\n00:04:55.785 --> 00:04:59.250\nSharePoint Designer or\nthis looks intimidating to you.\n\n83\n00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.480\nJust take your time with it.\n\n84\n00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.165\nIt's a learn-as-you-go product.\n\n85\n00:05:02.165 --> 00:05:02.800\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n86\n00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.890\n>> So that's why it's good to have\na sandbox environment where you can play.\n\n87\n00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.790\nSo gonna add a web part here.\n\n88\n00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.250\nThere's various categories,\nso I'm gonna choose Filters.\n\n89\n00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.110\nAnd then you're gonna choose\nthe Current User filter, and Add.\n\n90\n00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.620\nAnd now, I have this tiny little\nrectangular box in the bottom right.\n\n91\n00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.635\nRight behind my head!\n\n92\n00:05:26.635 --> 00:05:30.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay now, so there's a web part.\n\n93\n00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.788\nTab, in purple there.\n\n94\n00:05:33.788 --> 00:05:37.340\nSo I'm gonna choose that tab and\nthen web part properties,\n\n95\n00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.710\nso I want to edit that part.\n\n96\n00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.870\nNow this can be confusing when you're\nediting web parts because it's tough to\n\n97\n00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.740\nknow where to click,\nwhere do I make the edit?\n\n98\n00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.690\nSo this is one of those,\nI generally promote the idea\n\n99\n00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.310\nof examining options in menus, drop downs,\netc., even though you're not gonna click\n\n100\n00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.970\non all of them, just to be generally\naware of what the setting's changes are.\n\n101\n00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.489\nSo, filter web parts is, there's settings\nrelated to the appearance of the web\n\n102\n00:06:03.489 --> 00:06:06.943\nparts, you can constrain the web\npart to a specific height and\n\n103\n00:06:06.943 --> 00:06:08.480\nwidth in pixels or inches.\n\n104\n00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.486\nOr let SharePoint figure out\nhow to place the web part,\n\n105\n00:06:12.486 --> 00:06:17.113\nwithin a given zone or\nregion of the page, so do explore those.\n\n106\n00:06:17.113 --> 00:06:20.518\nYou can also have a fixed width and\nadjustable height or\n\n107\n00:06:20.518 --> 00:06:24.900\na fixed height and adjustable width,\nthere's a lot of flexibility.\n\n108\n00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.540\nSo I want to go into\nthe connections from the web part.\n\n109\n00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.948\nSo I have hovered in the upper right,\nConnections and\n\n110\n00:06:31.948 --> 00:06:34.382\nthen Send Filter Value to Documents.\n\n111\n00:06:34.382 --> 00:06:39.994\nConnection type will be,\nhit this drop down here,\n\n112\n00:06:39.994 --> 00:06:44.051\nand I want to Get Filter Falues from.\n\n113\n00:06:44.051 --> 00:06:46.200\nOoh, that didn't work, one more time.\n\n114\n00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:53.322\n>> Get Filter Values from and\nthen Configure.\n\n115\n00:06:53.322 --> 00:06:57.316\nAnd then there's another drop down here,\nthe Consumer Field Name.\n\n116\n00:06:57.316 --> 00:07:00.180\nIt has nothing to do with vendor or\nsupplier.\n\n117\n00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.580\nIt's the consuming field.\n\n118\n00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.111\nAnd this will be consuming\nthe Created By field.\n\n119\n00:07:11.477 --> 00:07:15.994\nAnd now I'll go up to Page, and save.\n\n120\n00:07:19.755 --> 00:07:20.394\nNow.\n\n121\n00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:32.970\nGo back into my web part security here.\n\n122\n00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:41.100\nAnd I'm gonna say, Prevent users from\ncreating connections between web parts and\n\n123\n00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.740\nalso Prevent users from accessing\nthe online web part gallery.\n\n124\n00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.540\nSo a web part can be a source of\ninformation that gets consumed by another\n\n125\n00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.040\nweb part on the same page for example.\n\n126\n00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.060\nTo further filter our find, but it does\nintroduce some security vulnerabilities.\n\n127\n00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.104\nLet's see the impact of\nthat settings change.\n\n128\n00:08:00.815 --> 00:08:02.130\nI'm gonna go Edit again.\n\n129\n00:08:05.426 --> 00:08:09.080\nInto that tiny little\nrectangular web part.\n\n130\n00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.920\nThe right hand side here.\n\n131\n00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.370\nWeb part properties.\n\n132\n00:08:18.341 --> 00:08:19.920\nScroll down a bit here.\n\n133\n00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.450\nAnd then, again, you hover in the web part\nand the little context arrow appears.\n\n134\n00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:26.990\nWeb part.\nMany of you have noticed that I don't have\n\n135\n00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.090\nthe ability to connect to another\nweb part, the change I just made\n\n136\n00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.260\nreduced the number of options on\nthis context menu, as expected.\n\n137\n00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.490\nSo again, users,\n\n138\n00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.310\nif they don't see an option are probably\nnot even going to know it exists.\n\n139\n00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:42.750\nIt's much better to have it done this way\nas opposed to an option that's grayed out.\n\n140\n00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.500\nSo then a user says hey why is\nthis grayed out, I'm the boss.\n\n141\n00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.990\nI should have access to all of this.\n\n142\n00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.630\nSo by hiding the option for\n\n143\n00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:52.310\nthe drop down menu you just\ndon't know what they're missing.\n\n144\n00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.730\n>> Always good to reduce\nthe calls to the help desk.\n\n145\n00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.170\n>> Indeed.\n\n146\n00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.610\nNow let's go into auditing.\n\n147\n00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.870\nSo I'm in to my site\ncollection auditing settings.\n\n148\n00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.510\nAnd then it's good to prevent\nrunaway growth of your audit log, so\n\n149\n00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:05.430\nit'll automatically trim.\n\n150\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.770\nAnd I'm gonna say,\nkeep four week weeks worth of data.\n\n151\n00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:13.120\nThat's enough.\nAnd then there's an option to save\n\n152\n00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.780\ncontent from the audit log\nin the document library.\n\n153\n00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.820\nI'm specifically interested in\nauditing moving or copying activities,\n\n154\n00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.010\nalso deleting and restoring.\n\n155\n00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.910\nYou see other options there.\n\n156\n00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:27.920\nI could audit the editing or checking\nout of items and then I'm gonna audit\n\n157\n00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.220\nany time there's an edit of a user or\npermission level.\n\n158\n00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.830\nThat's the kind of content\nI'm interested in.\n\n159\n00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.180\nSo be judicious.\n\n160\n00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.890\nDon't audit what you think you might need.\n\n161\n00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.020\nThere's got to be a reason to audit, or\n\n162\n00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.920\ndon't collect that information\nin the first place.\n\n163\n00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.840\nNow that can be a regulatory reason or\na business reason.\n\n164\n00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.390\nIn other words you're told\nto capture this data.\n\n165\n00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.812\nRight now I'm going to\ngo into permissions for\n\n166\n00:09:50.812 --> 00:09:55.902\nthis document library, so\nI'm going to make a permissions change,\n\n167\n00:09:55.902 --> 00:10:00.220\nand that's an event that we\nhave just set up auditing for.\n\n168\n00:10:05.345 --> 00:10:06.930\nScroll down here.\n\n169\n00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.720\nSee the various viewers here.\n\n170\n00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.150\nAll right, but I'm interested\nin Acme Team site visitors, so\n\n171\n00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.460\nI'll select that check box.\n\n172\n00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.960\nAnd remove user permissions, so\nI'm uninheriting, if you like.\n\n173\n00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.590\nAnd go back to documents, here.\n\n174\n00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:36.710\nAnd, sample.\n\n175\n00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:45.670\nAnd, deleted documents so\nthat's another auditable activity,\n\n176\n00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:46.910\nbased on settings I made earlier.\n\n177\n00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:55.480\nI'll go into Site Settings now and\nscroll down to Audit log reports.\n\n178\n00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.080\nAgain, if you're frustrated trying\nto find an item, just use Ctrl+F.\n\n179\n00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.870\nAnd I'm not gonna click on\nthe Excel spreadsheet here,\n\n180\n00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.515\nbecause I don't have Excel installed.\n\n181\n00:11:03.515 --> 00:11:05.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well that fast read to find out\n\n182\n00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.840\nwhat information,

that.\n\n187\n00:11:24.146 --> 00:11:31.980\nAnd okay, it'll save the report\nin that document library for\n\n188\n00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.730\nlater viewing, and I can choose to view\nthe report from that link there, or\n\n189\n00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.808\njust visit the document library\nat any time in the future.\n\n190\n00:11:38.808 --> 00:11:39.721\n>> Nice.\n\n191\n00:11:42.925 --> 00:11:47.383\n>> Let's go back into audit log reports.\n\n192\n00:11:54.535 --> 00:11:58.091\nAnd there's the security settings,\nand auditing settings,\n\n193\n00:11:58.091 --> 00:11:59.910\nagain I can view those reports.\n\n194\n00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.276\nAnd save them in document library,\nor other places.\n\n195\n00:12:17.248 --> 00:12:22.459\nAll right, so now we're gonna look at\nhardening our SharePoint environment and\n\n196\n00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:24.690\nthere's various ways to do that.\n\n197\n00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:29.040\nWe'll just look at some basics,\nspecifically changing port number and\n\n198\n00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.760\nthen configuring firewall exceptions and\nlook at some of the firewall settings\n\n199\n00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.160\navailable from our windows firewall\nadvanced security console.\n\n200\n00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.084\nLet's do that now.\n\n201\n00:12:45.816 --> 00:12:49.390\nOkay, so I'm on my SQL box now.\n\n202\n00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:53.120\nI want to go into SQL 2014\nconfiguration manager.\n\n203\n00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:04.280\nAnd make sure you are choosing the correct\nSQL server configuration option here.\n\n204\n00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.910\nNot the 32 bit, 64 bit.\n\n205\n00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:12.547\nAnd then underneath their protocols, for\n\n206\n00:13:12.547 --> 00:13:19.242\nm s equal server want to go into\nmy TCIP protocol properties and\n\n207\n00:13:19.242 --> 00:13:25.600\nI want my ip addresses tab\nscroll down there, to ip all.\n\n208\n00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.004\nAnd right now I've got the standard\ndefault port there 1431 but\n\n209\n00:13:30.004 --> 00:13:36.095\nthink about security through obscurity and\nthen choose port 54321.\n\n210\n00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:42.100\nA warning or informational message that\nyou'll have to restart that service so\n\n211\n00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:42.920\nI'll do that now.\n\n212\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.630\nJust stretch out this column header here,\n\n213\n00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:51.000\nI want the SQL server,\nMS SQL Server, service.\n\n214\n00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.520\nI'll restart that.\n\n215\n00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.827\nIt should take about 20 seconds.\n\n216\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.890\n>> Yeah,\nalways good to change those defaults.\n\n217\n00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:09.100\nWe've talked about that in general\nserver classes and our MCSA and SE.\n\n218\n00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:15.210\nEverybody knows what port numbers\nthese applications use by default.\n\n219\n00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:20.410\nBy changing it, as Mark said, at least\nit's another layer of security, right?\n\n220\n00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.890\nIt's not the end all in security,\nthey can find it eventually.\n\n221\n00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.750\nBut it's one more step that they've\ngotta go through which makes it a little\n\n222\n00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.750\nmore difficult.\n\n223\n00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:31.480\nWhich give us a time to maybe find them,\nstop them, whatever the case may be.\n\n224\n00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.980\n>> Exactly,\nit's like having the club on your car.\n\n225\n00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.210\nIs that a theft deterrent?\n\n226\n00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:42.140\nNot exactly but it might have someone\nlook onto the next car: an easier target.\n\n227\n00:14:43.735 --> 00:14:49.333\nOkay, so for some reason I'm\nnot able to load a web page.\n\n228\n00:14:49.333 --> 00:14:51.750\nYeah, because I changed the port number.\n\n229\n00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.470\nThat would do it.\n\n230\n00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:58.410\nSo Don't experiment with this\nstuff in a production environment.\n\n231\n00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:02.940\n>> So really the port number on\nthe webpage didn't change but\n\n232\n00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.810\nnow SharePoint front end is\ntrying to reach over to SQL\n\n233\n00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:09.630\nto retrieve all that information\nto display and it can't find it.\n\n234\n00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.530\nBecause we changed the port\nnumber on the SQL.\n\n235\n00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:12.540\n>> Exactly.\n\n236\n00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.960\n>> Or the SQL server.\n\n237\n00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.110\n>> Indeed, so\nnow I'm just trying different sites.\n\n238\n00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.940\nReport numbers is to show, hey, I can't\nconnect in to my SQL backend anymore.\n\n239\n00:15:24.053 --> 00:15:24.815\nNo, what do we do?\n\n240\n00:15:24.815 --> 00:15:27.164\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's go into Client Config.\n\n241\n00:15:33.413 --> 00:15:38.380\nAnd that opens up my SQL\nserver client network utility.\n\n242\n00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.951\nLet me go to the alias tab.\n\n243\n00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.029\nThis will be Acme.db,\nand there's my tcp ip,\n\n244\n00:15:50.029 --> 00:15:54.477\nsee it says dynamically determined port,\nno.\n\n245\n00:15:54.477 --> 00:15:59.132\nI'm going to change that to port 54321,\n\n246\n00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.620\nAnd okay.\n\n247\n00:16:09.295 --> 00:16:10.980\nAnd, okay.\n\n248\n00:16:22.154 --> 00:16:26.330\nOkay, and now let's go into\nWindows Firewall with Advanced Security.\n\n249\n00:16:31.719 --> 00:16:34.192\nClick to maximize that, mm-hm.\n\n250\n00:16:39.108 --> 00:16:42.339\nScroll down here,\nI want Windows Firewall Properties,\n\n251\n00:16:42.339 --> 00:16:45.700\nwhich is hiding in plain\nsight in the middle console.\n\n252\n00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:51.092\nJust verifying that\nFirewall state is on for\n\n253\n00:16:51.092 --> 00:16:53.722\nour domain profile.\n\n254\n00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:55.768\nWe see some different profiles there,\n\n255\n00:16:55.768 --> 00:16:59.870\nprivate to public profiles represented\non different tabs of this dialog box.\n\n256\n00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:07.060\nThat's all I wanted to check\nthat was on my SQL box.\n\n257\n00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:12.413\nI'll go back to my SharePoint machine.\n\n258\n00:17:22.025 --> 00:17:22.845\nStill not connecting.\n\n259\n00:17:22.845 --> 00:17:23.375\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n260\n00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.372\n>> Go back to my SQL box.\n\n261\n00:17:54.953 --> 00:17:56.629\nAnd inbound rules.\n\n262\n00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.169\nI'll create a new rule.\n\n263\n00:18:04.901 --> 00:18:06.590\nThis will be based on a port.\n\n264\n00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.781\nTCP port, as you guessed, 54321.\n\n265\n00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.412\nAllow that connection.\n\n266\n00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:27.116\nAnd this will apply to my domain profile,\nI'll deselect private and\n\n267\n00:18:27.116 --> 00:18:31.691\npublic, hit Next and then give it a name.\n\n268\n00:18:31.691 --> 00:18:34.279\nIt's good to have descriptive names,\ndon't get lazy here,\n\n269\n00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:35.915\nbecause if you need to troubleshoot.\n\n270\n00:18:35.915 --> 00:18:38.642\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's nice to have it be obvious right\n\n271\n00:18:38.642 --> 00:18:42.157\nupfront, it's in this\nSQL server inbound TCP.\n\n272\n00:18:42.157 --> 00:18:48.654\nTraffic from SharePoint,\n\n273\n00:18:48.654 --> 00:18:51.770\nand Finish.\n\n274\n00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.574\nThat's all I need there.\n\n275\n00:18:54.574 --> 00:18:56.158\nLet's go back to SP1.\n\n276\n00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:03.408\nLet's have a look at the Firewall rules\nand ports in effect relating to our\n\n277\n00:19:03.408 --> 00:19:09.969\nSharePoint deployment, On SP1.\n\n278\n00:19:09.969 --> 00:19:13.380\nSo I'll go into Windows Firewall\nProperties on this machine.\n\n279\n00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.785\nFirewall on, okay,\nthat's what I wanted to see.\n\n280\n00:19:24.687 --> 00:19:25.680\nAnd inbound rule.\n\n281\n00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.400\nSo the way these are organized is\nby group, which is very handy.\n\n282\n00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.110\nYou can also organize by name, but\n\n283\n00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:38.731\nin this demo I'm interested in\nthe SharePoint related inbound rules.\n\n284\n00:19:47.875 --> 00:19:49.812\nSo we have various rules here.\n\n285\n00:19:54.104 --> 00:19:56.086\nVarious inbound rules.\n\n286\n00:20:01.866 --> 00:20:04.005\nResizing the columns is always helpful.\n\n287\n00:20:04.005 --> 00:20:05.260\n[LAUGH]\n>> Make\n\n288\n00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.050\nit a little easier to see more info.\n\n289\n00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:12.860\n>> Indeed, some of these rules are so long\nif I autosize the column it goes on for\n\n290\n00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.550\nmore than half the screen.\n\n291\n00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.484\nOkay, so\nhere's our SharePoint central admin v4.\n\n292\n00:20:17.484 --> 00:20:21.038\nYou can see there\nthe port number is 55555.\n\n293\n00:20:21.038 --> 00:20:22.840\nWe set that up when we set the farm.\n\n294\n00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:30.590\nAnd we have other ports enabled for\ndifferent web apps.\n\n295\n00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.110\nThere's 80.\n\n296\n00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:34.290\nThere's one for 16,500.\n\n297\n00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:35.989\nThat's the SharePoint search rule.\n\n298\n00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.530\nSo there's a range of ports for\nsearch, 20 in all.\n\n299\n00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.240\nSharePoint Web Services uses a few ports.\n\n300\n00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.731\nThey're listed there, 32843 4 and 5.\n\n301\n00:20:49.731 --> 00:20:51.267\nI should have thought of this before,\n\n302\n00:20:51.267 --> 00:20:53.290\nI'll drag the port number column over-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n303\n00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.430\n>> So we don't have to scroll across.\n\n304\n00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:56.420\nWhat a concept.\n\n305\n00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.510\nOkay.\n\n306\n00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:01.064\nAnd we have SP user code V4.\n\n307\n00:21:01.064 --> 00:21:03.490\nThat's for sandbox solutions.\n\n308\n00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:04.920\nOur little test environment.\n\n309\n00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.567\nSo that's port 32846.\n\n310\n00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.605\nSo although it's good to know what the\nports are in use on your SharePoint box,\n\n311\n00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:17.250\nwe don't have to configure any ports\nlike we did on the SQL backend.\n\n312\n00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:21.130\nBecause it's always the SharePoint\nmachines that are interacting with\n\n313\n00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.320\nthe content stored in the SQL database.\n\n314\n00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.310\nBut as I always say, trust but verify.\n\n315\n00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:31.320\nSo let's make sure that those tabs\nhave come up since we did the port\n\n316\n00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.740\nreconfiguration and\nin fact, there they are.\n\n317\n00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:34.489\nGood times.\n\n318\n00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.570\n>> All right Mark, thanks for\nthat great demonstration on setting or\n\n319\n00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:44.380\nconfiguring our farm level security from\nweb app security or web part security.\n\n320\n00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.670\nWe looked at configuring auditing all\nthe way to changing the port numbers that\n\n321\n00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:51.290\nwe're using to talk to our SQL backend.\n\n322\n00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.640\nWe got our security\nthrough obscurity there.\n\n323\n00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.470\nSo hope everybody enjoyed\nwatching this one.\n\n324\n00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.270\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike

00:00:15.435\nat ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:18.530\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.020\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe'll look at Managing Taxonomy.\n\n6\n00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.410\nWe're talking about content types and\nmetadata and\n\n7\n00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.140\nmaking sure we've got that setup\nproperly in our SharePoint environment.\n\n8\n00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.470\nHere to help us with that is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n9\n00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.370\nHow are you doing Mark?\n\n10\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.710\n>> Good Mike, thanks very much.\n\n11\n00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.950\nOkay, so in a different episode,\nwe talked about the why of content types.\n\n12\n00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.210\nThe importance of standardizing\ndefinitions, for example of a customer\n\n13\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.700\nfield, or a patient, so that different\ndepartments and divisions within your\n\n14\n00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.220\norganization define the metadata relating\nto a customer, for example, the same way.\n\n15\n00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.170\nCapturing the same kinds of data.\n\n16\n00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.250\nSo we talked about the why,\nlet's dive into the how.\n\n17\n00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.510\n>> All right, sounds fun.\n\n18\n00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.010\n>> Indeed.\n\n19\n00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.290\nOkay, so I'm in my Acme Team Site,\nI'm gonna go into site settings and\n\n20\n00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.223\nI want site columns under\nweb designer gallery's.\n\n21\n00:01:20.394 --> 00:01:25.280\nNotice we have a variety of columns here,\npre-built in.\n\n22\n00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.880\nSo, relating to contacts,\naddress information, pager.\n\n23\n00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.755\nWow, that's old school.\n\n24\n00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:33.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Fax number is pretty old, as well.\n\n25\n00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.950\nLet's create our own site called,\nbecause we're not restricted to just what\n\n26\n00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.620\nthe default ones are, and\nas we discussed there are a variety\n\n27\n00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.410\nof data types supported, and our column,\nwe're gonna call this one supplier.\n\n28\n00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.940\nSo you might wanna explore\nthe various possibilities there\n\n29\n00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.680\nrelating to numbers and currencies.\n\n30\n00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.030\nI'm gonna create a new group just for\n\n31\n00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.930\nease of organization of the site\ncolumns I'm gonna create.\n\n32\n00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.450\nSo I'm gonna call this Acme Columns.\n\n33\n00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.090\nAnd there's other settings there relating\nto whether or not we require metadata or\n\n34\n00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.870\nwhether it's an optional column.\n\n35\n00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.713\nI'll just leave it at optional.\n\n36\n00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:20.380\nSo conveniently the Acme Columns\ngroup appears at the top.\n\n37\n00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.809\nI need to create another column now.\n\n38\n00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.140\nAnd this one will be\ncalled Payment Due Date.\n\n39\n00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.260\nAnd as you probably guessed.\n\n40\n00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.315\n>> That you're gonna chose a date type.\n\n41\n00:02:34.315 --> 00:02:39.200\n[LAUGH]\n>> Funny you should mention that\n\n42\n00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.010\nbecause I am.\n\n43\n00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.550\n>> So basically you're defining\nthe name of the column and\n\n44\n00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.130\nthen what type of data you expect\nto be stored in that column.\n\n45\n00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.020\n>> Exactly.\n\n46\n00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.760\n>> Now does it restrict you?\n\n47\n00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.670\nIf you set it as a date time does\nthat prevent you from typing in text?\n\n48\n00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.423\n>> Absolutely,\n\n49\n00:02:56.423 --> 00:03:00.446\nit's not a free form field unless you\nchoose the very first default option.\n\n50\n00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:00.946\n>> Gotcha.\n\n51\n00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.240\n>> Like we did for the first one,\nthe supplier column, and this column.\n\n52\n00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.310\nSo single line of text\nmeans free form data.\n\n53\n00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.540\nSo this will be Acme Department column.\n\n54\n00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.440\nAnd again, this column group is for\n\n55\n00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.820\nease of organization and ease of finding\nthe relevent column we want to deploy.\n\n56\n00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.980\nAnd create another column here called\n\n57\n00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.810\nPayment Amount and\nthat will be a currency type.\n\n58\n00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.750\n>> And this will all come from our\nplanning phase when we decided what types\n\n59\n00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.640\nof information we planned\non storing in our site.\n\n60\n00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.200\n>> Exactly.\nNotice that there's various\n\n61\n00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.320\ncurrency formats there depending\non the country you're in.\n\n62\n00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.780\nOften in SharePoint,\nthis is another example.\n\n63\n00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.861\nThe actual doing of it is not that hard,\nbut are you doing the right thing?\n\n64\n00:04:00.861 --> 00:04:04.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If there's no governance you're\n\n65\n00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.970\nalmost definitely gonna have to deploy or\n\n66\n00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.710\nutilize the governance function later and\nyou have to undo things.\n\n67\n00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.740\nSo it takes a lot longer.\n\n68\n00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.670\nSo plan upfront, know your plan and\nthen you can implement it.\n\n69\n00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.860\nSo just agreeing on what the standards\nshould be often is far harder then\n\n70\n00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.790\ndeploying them.\n\n71\n00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.120\nOkay now I'm going to\ncreate a new content type.\n\n72\n00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.958\nIf you recall from other conversation,\n\n73\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:32.967\na content type is a unique\ngrouping of metadata columns.\n\n74\n00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:40.340\nAnd I can restrict based\non the parent content type.\n\n75\n00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.470\nSo a variety of options there,\nwhich we won't get into now.\n\n76\n00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.220\nAnd we'll create a new group for\nthis content type.\n\n77\n00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.610\nRemember content type,\nunique grouping of metadata columns,\n\n78\n00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.360\nhas nothing to do with the file type.\n\n79\n00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.790\nThat's one of the concepts people\nhave a hard time grasping at first.\n\n80\n00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.000\nIt's nothing to do with whether it's an\nExcel spreadsheet, Powerpoint, Word doc.\n\n81\n00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.720\nIt strictly refers to the kinds of\nmetadata we're going to capture.\n\n82\n00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.040\nSo I'm gonna add columns\nto this site content type\n\n83\n00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.170\nfrom the site columns I just created\nbefore, in the ACME columns group.\n\n84\n00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.560\nSo there's the four columns\nwe already just created.\n\n85\n00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.700\n>> All right so and\nbecause you created that group,\n\n86\n00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.370\nyou were able to filter that list down and\nfind just the ones you're looking for.\n\n87\n00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.340\n>> Right.\nAs opposed to wading through hundreds of\n\n88\n00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.352\nsite columns.\n\n89\n00:05:29.352 --> 00:05:29.857\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n90\n00:05:29.857 --> 00:05:32.910\n>> So I can add them all at once by\n\n91\n00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.359\nusing shift and click and okay.\n\n92\n00:05:41.766 --> 00:05:46.994\nI've got various settings here associated\nwith a site content type, for now,\n\n93\n00:05:46.994 --> 00:05:54.897\nI'm gonna go back into site settings And\nsite columns.\n\n94\n00:05:59.501 --> 00:06:00.630\nAnd create a column.\n\n95\n00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.148\nThis one will be called Client.\n\n96\n00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:11.920\nPut the client into the ACME columns.\n\n97\n00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:13.793\nThere's a pattern here.\n\n98\n00:06:13.793 --> 00:06:16.868\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And okay.\n\n99\n00:06:16.868 --> 00:06:21.260\nAnd another site column.\n\n100\n00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.620\nAnd this one will be Final Effective Date.\n\n101\n00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.030\nThat will be a date and time type.\n\n102\n00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.713\nIn the ACME columns group.\n\n103\n00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.230\nI could allow for a default value there or\njust let people choose the date.\n\n104\n00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:50.240\nI always like having people\nchoose the column input, or\n\n105\n00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.990\nit could be a calculated field,\nas opposed to having a default.\n\n106\n00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.010\nBecause some people just want to save the\ndocument, for example, they're working on.\n\n107\n00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.630\nThey don't actually pay\nattention to the metadata,\n\n108\n00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.770\nthey just want to click okay okay and\nget it done.\n\n109\n00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.760\nSo by requiring them to actually choose or\nenter some value, we're\n\n110\n00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.000\nmore likely to get accurate information\nwhich helps us for a variety of reasons.\n\n111\n00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.090\nLocating content later,\nmanaging content in terms of\n\n112\n00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.950\ninformation retention content\nwith a certain content type.\n\n113\n00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.138\nSo you don't want to totally\nirritate your users,\n\n114\n00:07:24.138 --> 00:07:24.704\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n115\n00:07:24.704 --> 00:07:26.290\n>> But you're collecting metadata for\n\n116\n00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.210\na reason, that's because, through\ngovernance, you've decided what kinds of\n\n117\n00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.560\nmetadata is important to capture for\nvarious content types.\n\n118\n00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.210\n>> It always amazes me too, they fight,\nand fight, and fight, trying to put that\n\n119\n00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.760\ninformation in, but when they go to search\nfor something and it's so easy to find,\n\n120\n00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.740\nthanks to all the metadata we've forced\nthem to enter, they don't complain then.\n\n121\n00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.156\n>> Right, although you're probably\nnot gonna get credit for that.\n\n122\n00:07:50.156 --> 00:07:52.492\n>> Yeah, a problem with that.\n\n123\n00:07:52.492 --> 00:07:55.045\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Of course it should be that way.\n\n124\n00:07:55.045 --> 00:07:58.110\nNo good deed goes unpunished.\n\n125\n00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.648\nSo, we added a contract column there.\n\n126\n00:08:00.648 --> 00:08:03.198\nAnd, we're gonna add\nanother site content type.\n\n127\n00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.397\nI want the client column, contract owner,\n\n128\n00:08:09.397 --> 00:08:14.110\nand finial effective date columns,\nto make up this site content type.\n\n129\n00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:23.251\n>> So, so far we've defined\nseveral different columns and\n\n130\n00:08:23.251 --> 00:08:25.100\ntwo different content types, and\n\n131\n00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.940\nthen associated those columns we created\nwith the different content types.\n\n132\n00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:30.440\n>> Exactly.\n\n133\n00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.290\nSo now I'm gonna go into my ADAC,\n\n134\n00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:41.050\nmy Active Directory Administrative Center\nand I'm gonna create a new user.\n\n135\n00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:48.510\nActually this will be\nthe SharePoint general MMS account.\n\n136\n00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.102\nI'll give it a UPN log on.\n\n137\n00:08:54.988 --> 00:08:56.799\nCall it Acme MMS.\n\n138\n00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.575\nAnd we'll have to enter a password\nas well and confirm it.\n\n139\n00:09:01.575 --> 00:09:05.085\nThe usual, the usual.\n\n140\n00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:12.349\nI could have done this from\nActive Directory uses computers as well,\n\n141\n00:09:12.349 --> 00:09:13.111\nif I wanted.\n\n142\n00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:15.090\nWhatever tickles your fancy.\n\n143\n00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.209\nAnd then I'll say password never expires\nand user cannot change password.\n\n144\n00:09:22.512 --> 00:09:23.520\nAnd okay.\n\n145\n00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:31.075\nAnd go back into my SharePoint machine,\nback into system Settings.\n\n146\n00:09:31.075 --> 00:09:37.237\nI want security And I'm gonna\n\n147\n00:09:37.237 --> 00:09:42.146\ngo into configure Managed Accounts and\nI'm gonna register a new managed account.\n\n148\n00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.921\nRemember managed accounts Windows takes\ncare of password changes according to your\n\n149\n00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:54.422\ndomain policy automatically, there's\nnothing that you have to do to manually\n\n150\n00:09:54.422 --> 00:09:57.930\nchange the passwords for\nyour service accounts.\n\n151\n00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.100\n>> Always good.\n\n152\n00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:01.970\nLittle less work for me, I like that.\n\n153\n00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.680\n>> Is it laziness or efficiency?\n\n154\n00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.252\n>> Efficiency is what I'm gonna say.\n\n155\n00:10:06.252 --> 00:10:06.824\n>> I agree.\n\n156\n00:10:06.824 --> 00:10:08.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's face it,\n\n157\n00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.036\nwe have enough other tasks to worry about.\n\n158\n00:10:10.036 --> 00:10:10.730\n>> Exactly.\n\n159\n00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.000\n>> Changing of passwords\nshouldn't be one of them.\n\n160\n00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.200\nOkay, I'm gonna restart the management\nweb service on my server.\n\n161\n00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.650\n>> And that's because you changed\nthe account associated with it.\n\n162\n00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.610\n>> Right.\n>> Okay.\n\n163\n00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.750\n>> Hello, it says,\nthis shouldn't take long.\n\n164\n00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.880\nWell you're right.\n\n165\n00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.052\nBut why is it taking long?\n\n166\n00:10:29.052 --> 00:10:31.414\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well it shouldn't, but it is.\n\n167\n00:10:31.414 --> 00:10:33.166\n[LAUGH]\n>> I agree with you.\n\n168\n00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:34.610\n>> Fix it.\n\n169\n00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:35.710\nSo this is one of those.\n\n170\n00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.980\nWe get these kind of Windows often.\n\n171\n00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.170\nNo matter how much,\nmany resources you throw at SharePoint,\n\n172\n00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.050\nthere's gonna be some waiting around.\n\n173\n00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:46.820\nSo you may not like it but\nit's part of the course.\n\n174\n00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.841\nSo I'm gonna create a new management data\n\n175\n00:10:51.841 --> 00:10:57.010\nservice and this one I'm gonna call.\n\n176\n00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.848\nIf I can get my typing happening here.\n\n177\n00:10:58.848 --> 00:11:01.239\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Fat fingering.\n\n178\n00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.450\nWhat am I doing here?\n\n179\n00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.820\nThere's putin again.\n\n180\n00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.540\nHe keeps appearing, that's annoying.\n\n181\n00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.560\n>> The Russians are attacking.\n\n182\n00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.360\n>> That's right, or\nthey're buzzing our ships rudely.\n\n183\n00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.400\nOkay, back in here.\n\n184\n00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.200\nLet's get it right the second time here.\n\n185\n00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.760\nSo Acme Managed Metadata.\n\n186\n00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.850\nServices I want.\n\n187\n00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:28.920\nI'll give it a database name.\n\n188\n00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.540\nRemember when we create new service\naccounts often we're creating one or\n\n189\n00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:38.430\nmore databases at the same\ntime on as needed basis.\n\n190\n00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.320\nAnd I can create a new application\npool which I'm gonna do.\n\n191\n00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.680\nI could reuse an existing\napplication pool.\n\n192\n00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.290\nRemember everytime we carve\nout an application pool we're\n\n193\n00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.960\nbasically sectioning off two\nto 300 megabytes of RAM.\n\n194\n00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:54.300\nSo, for resource reasons, you may wanna\nchoose an existing application pool,\n\n195\n00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:59.220\nideally for security reasons and\nisolation, you have a separate application\n\n196\n00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:03.670\nfull, reach manage, reach metadata\nservice, reach service account indeed.\n\n197\n00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:11.864\nAll right, Scroll up here.\n\n198\n00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.445\nAnd specify content type hub.\n\n199\n00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:24.320\nSo I'll do that.\n\n200\n00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.890\nSo we can have a hub site.\n\n201\n00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:31.590\nWhere we have definitions of this metadata\nwhen I propagate throughout our SharePoint\n\n202\n00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:38.360\nform and then we can have consuming\nside collection so we establish\n\n203\n00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:44.090\ncontent types and at one site and\n\n204\n00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:48.120\nthen let's say we need to update\na content type why because maybe through\n\n205\n00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.700\ngovernors who decided that we need to\ncapture or maybe regulatory requirements.\n\n206\n00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.270\nWe need to capture another field of\ninformation now like some kinda ID number,\n\n207\n00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.260\nfor example.\n\n208\n00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:01.200\nWell, rather than changing the content\ntype at 50 or 500 different site\n\n209\n00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.730\ncollections we can change that metadata\ncolumn or add an additional column once.\n\n210\n00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:12.940\nSo we update the content type at the hub\nsite and then we can propagate the change\n\n211\n00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.710\nto all these so\ncalled consuming site collections.\n\n212\n00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.800\nSo far more efficient.\n\n213\n00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:23.910\nYou can also run reports so you can get\nnotified or see which site collections\n\n214\n00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:30.400\nhave updated a content type definition,\nif and when you update that definition.\n\n215\n00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.655\nSo then, you can take corrective action\nand figure out why that consuming\n\n216\n00:13:34.655 --> 00:13:38.715\nsite collection is not, in fact,\nreceiving the propagated change.\n\n217\n00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.996\nAnytime we can do the centralized\nadministration like this,\n\n218\n00:13:46.996 --> 00:13:50.260\nmaking those in one place and\nallowing that to be replicated or\n\n219\n00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.610\npropagated out to the others always\ngonna be the best way to go.\n\n220\n00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.640\n>> Indeed.\n>> Okay so sometimes that I made a mistake\n\n221\n00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.970\nhere, you might encounter\nthis in a SharePoint context.\n\n222\n00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.890\nOften you need, a trailing slash.\n\n223\n00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:09.581\nOf course, spelling the url correctly\nin the first place, is helpful.\n\n224\n00:14:09.581 --> 00:14:13.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you might think,\n\n225\n00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.100\nwhy do I need a trailing slash?\n\n226\n00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.283\nWell sometimes you do.\n\n227\n00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:23.018\nIn order for\na settings change to take effect.\n\n228\n00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:32.040\n>> Always nice when they don't really tell\nyou why the okay button isn't working.\n\n229\n00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.410\nYou can go back and figure what it is.\n\n230\n00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:35.430\n>> Exactly.\nOkay, sometimes it's just waiting.\n\n231\n00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.320\nThere's no indication that\nyou've depressed the okay,\n\n232\n00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.710\nlike a change in background.\n\n233\n00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:44.784\nAnd it just doesn't\ngive you that feedback.\n\n234\n00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.640\nSo I've got my server name,\n\n235\n00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:58.350\nand port number, and trailing slash.\n\n236\n00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:59.200\nSo that worked.\n\n237\n00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.169\n>> All right.\n>> At last.\n\n238\n00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.652\nGo back into site settings now.\n\n239\n00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.550\nAnd now I'm gonna go down under\nsite collection administration, and\n\n240\n00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:14.950\nsite collection features.\n\n241\n00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.904\nRemember features can be\nenabled at different levels, so\n\n242\n00:15:17.904 --> 00:15:21.595\ndon't go into site features, no,\nyou need site collection features.\n\n243\n00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.970\nThat way you're enabling it for\nall the sites that are part of\n\n244\n00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.979\nthat collection rather than have\nto do it on the individual five or\n\n245\n00:15:30.979 --> 00:15:32.970\n500 sites within that collection.\n\n246\n00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.640\n>> Exactly and sometimes there's\nonly one way to do it and\n\n247\n00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.050\nyou must do it at the site\ncollection level or the site level.\n\n248\n00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.529\nSo there's, sometimes it overlap\na feature, other times it's not.\n\n249\n00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.250\nSo I'm gonna go into Site Content Types\nand manage publishing for\n\n250\n00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.860\nthis site content type.\n\n251\n00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:53.270\nAnd because I have not published\nthis content type before,\n\n252\n00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.788\nthe only option available\nto me is publish.\n\n253\n00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:58.290\nIf I had published this content type,\n\n254\n00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:03.463\nthen I would have the other options\navailable to me, unpublish or republish.\n\n255\n00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:09.440\nSo publishing is what's going to make\nit available to the sites within that\n\n256\n00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.690\nsite collection?\n\n257\n00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:13.329\n>> Yeah and beyond and any consuming site.\n\n258\n00:16:13.329 --> 00:16:13.829\n>> Okay.\n\n259\n00:16:17.191 --> 00:16:22.769\nSo I'm gonna publish the invoice,\nexcuse me, site content type as well.\n\n260\n00:16:26.391 --> 00:16:27.670\nAnd go into Monitoring.\n\n261\n00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:32.090\nGet rid of that little pop-up there.\n\n262\n00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:33.480\nReview job definitions.\n\n263\n00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:39.190\nSo remember, there's timer tasks or\njobs that occur at regular intervals.\n\n264\n00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.890\nSometimes they're every few minutes.\n\n265\n00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.370\nOthers, hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly.\n\n266\n00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:48.610\nBut to tap the machine as it were and\nmake things happen faster\n\n267\n00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:53.510\ncuz we don't have all day to wait,\nwe can go into the timer job.\n\n268\n00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.630\nSo there's my content site subscriber for\n\n269\n00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.580\nthe particular site\ncollection I'm working in.\n\n270\n00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.310\nAnd click on the Run Now button.\n\n271\n00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:05.020\nSo it doesn't wait til\nthe next scheduled time.\n\n272\n00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.720\nWe're saying, do it now.\n\n273\n00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.280\nDo not delay.\n\n274\n00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.320\n>> Nice.\n\n275\n00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.810\n>> There's still some\nwaiting around sometimes, but\n\n276\n00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:15.230\nit's a lot faster than just waiting for\nthe natural schedule to kick in for\n\n277\n00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:17.210\nthat particular task or time or job.\n\n278\n00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:22.462\nNow I'll go back into site content types.\n\n279\n00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.677\nLet's see if they published and\n\n280\n00:17:28.677 --> 00:17:33.729\nnow we can see the contract and\ninvoice ACME content types.\n\n281\n00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:52.533\nNow I'm gonna go back in\nApplication Management and\n\n282\n00:17:52.533 --> 00:17:56.310\nmy Acme Manage Metadata Service.\n\n283\n00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.590\nNow, keep in mind it's the same\nnamed link, it looks like, but\n\n284\n00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.180\nthat refers to the service connection.\n\n285\n00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:05.390\nSo, make sure you're utilizing\nthe management entity to service.\n\n286\n00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.960\nSelecting that line.\n\n287\n00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.980\nThen the manage button\nappears on the ribbon.\n\n288\n00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.270\nNow, we're into\nthe Term Store Management Tool.\n\n289\n00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:17.630\nSo we talked about the importance of using\nTerm Stores and the ways you can use it\n\n290\n00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:21.550\nto restrict entry, for example, as opposed\nto people writing in a product number.\n\n291\n00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:26.400\nFor example, we can say that they must\n\n292\n00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.300\nchoose In terms of metadata\nfrom a preapproved list.\n\n293\n00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:36.630\nSo I'm gonna add gin in my good\nold spadmin, S-P admin account\n\n294\n00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.770\nas terms store administrative, so people\nwith the ability to create term sets, and\n\n295\n00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.990\nadd and modify terms,\nlet's share what that looks like now.\n\n296\n00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:49.830\nSo I'm in my ACME management service,\nthere's a drop down menu.\n\n297\n00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:50.960\nI want New Group.\n\n298\n00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.970\nAnd it automatically puts the cursor,\nand so\n\n299\n00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.740\nI can just start typing the new\ngroup name, which is handy.\n\n300\n00:18:58.850 --> 00:18:59.945\nThanks to the devs on that one.\n\n301\n00:18:59.945 --> 00:19:05.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I have an organization Group name,\n\n302\n00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:09.340\nand then within that group name,\nI wanted to find a new term sets.\n\n303\n00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:11.790\nSo, I need to find.\n\n304\n00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:13.210\nThis one I call it department.\n\n305\n00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:22.100\nAnd within that term set called\ndepartment, I need to creat some\n\n306\n00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:26.606\nterms In other words,\nsome department names.\n\n307\n00:19:26.606 --> 00:19:30.539\nSo marketing,\n\n308\n00:19:30.539 --> 00:19:35.530\nfinance, IT, got to include IT in there.\n\n309\n00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:36.600\nSales.\n\n310\n00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.630\n>> So when you created the side\ncolumn in that, you did,\n\n311\n00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.300\nyou defined it as a single line text.\n\n312\n00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.440\nBut nowhere in there was there a way to\nlimit or control what they were typing.\n\n313\n00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.400\nIt was just basically freeform.\n\n314\n00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.590\nAs a separate step, you have to go back\ninto this term store management, create\n\n315\n00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:57.010\nthe datasets, and then somehow associate\nthat with the column that we created.\n\n316\n00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:57.860\n>> The term sets.\n\n317\n00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.860\nYes, exactly.\n\n318\n00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:06.770\nSo, now I'm gonna create\na supplier term set.\n\n319\n00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:08.350\n>> And while you're doing that,\nI know we've talked and\n\n320\n00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:12.490\nit's just one of those things that\nreally helps with consistency in\n\n321\n00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:16.780\nentering data into any type of database,\nin this case in SharePoint\n\n322\n00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.370\nwe talked earlier about some people\nsaying FL, some people saying FLA.\n\n323\n00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:21.560\nSome people capitalizing and\n\n324\n00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.610\nsome people not\n>> This way they have to choose\n\n325\n00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:24.140\nfrom a list.\n\n326\n00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.620\nAnd you get good consistency.\n\n327\n00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:30.320\nCuz when you run those reports it's extra\nsteps if you have to think about gosh.\n\n328\n00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.000\nDo I have to make sure I search for\nit this way and this way and this way?\n\n329\n00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.270\nIt can be a real pain.\n\n330\n00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.070\n>> Exactly.\n\n331\n00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.780\n>> Not to mention the reports look ugly\n\n332\n00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.330\nbecause all the states\nare listed differently.\n\n333\n00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:40.040\nThat's horrible.\n\n334\n00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:40.696\n>> Right, right, so\n\n335\n00:20:40.696 --> 00:20:43.365\nthere's way we can clean up data but\nthat's beyond the scope of this course.\n\n336\n00:20:43.365 --> 00:20:46.055\n>> Yeah, that's too much work.\n\n337\n00:20:46.055 --> 00:20:46.900\n>> [LAUGH] Just kidding.\n\n338\n00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:52.250\nThat's a BI related concept,\nso remember suggestions.\n\n339\n00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:53.680\n>> That's right.\n>> Send you suggestions in.\n\n340\n00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.805\n>> Sent them in.\nBring Mark back.\n\n341\n00:20:54.805 --> 00:21:00.410\n[LAUGH]\n>> Alright so now we've got a supplier.\n\n342\n00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:01.400\nTerms that group there.\n\n343\n00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:06.060\nAnd I got some supplier names,\nLyons, Presto, etc., Tully.\n\n344\n00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.170\nAnd now go back into site settings.\n\n345\n00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:17.560\nAnd I want site columns again.\n\n346\n00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.430\nI'm gonna create another column.\n\n347\n00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:27.830\nCall this one, Supplier,\n\n348\n00:21:33.151 --> 00:21:36.564\nMMS.\n\n349\n00:21:36.564 --> 00:21:40.016\nImplying that the terms\navailable are gonna come\n\n350\n00:21:40.016 --> 00:21:43.240\nfrom the manage by the date of service.\n\n351\n00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.750\nSo I clicked the last radio button there.\n\n352\n00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:45.520\nManage meta data.\n\n353\n00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:53.978\nAnd I'll use my ACME columns group.\n\n354\n00:21:53.978 --> 00:21:56.160\nMm-hm.\n\n355\n00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.620\nAnother radio button down there\nwas requiring unique values.\n\n356\n00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.300\nSo that's something you\nmay want to consider for\n\n357\n00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:06.330\na column to require you to make values,\nfor example, customer ID number.\n\n358\n00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:10.110\nSo, now that I term set settings, here's\nwhat I just created in my management.\n\n359\n00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:15.020\nI did a service, and under organization,\nI have department and supplier term sets.\n\n360\n00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:20.850\nNo default value, and notice how there's\nno fill-in choices allowed either.\n\n361\n00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.780\nI don't want any write-ins like\nright in ballots for the election.\n\n362\n00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:24.650\nNo.\n\n363\n00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:29.860\nYou must choose one of these\noptions that we restrict you to.\n\n364\n00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:30.700\nPower.\n\n365\n00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.310\n>> Power.\n>> Use it wisely.\n\n366\n00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.270\n>> Absolutely.\n>> So ACME department\n\n367\n00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.420\nwill be the call of name.\n\n368\n00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:41.635\nI like to put the whoops\n[INAUDIBLE] not dyslexic.\n\n369\n00:22:41.635 --> 00:22:42.135\nMMS.\n\n370\n00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.190\nNot that there's anything\nwrong with being dyslexic.\n\n371\n00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.640\nSome brilliant people have been dyslexic.\n\n372\n00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.180\nSo, manage metadata again, for the type.\n\n373\n00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.775\nHopefully I don't get any\nangry chat messages now.\n\n374\n00:22:53.775 --> 00:22:57.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Stop picking on groups of people.\n\n375\n00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:01.220\nAcme columns, and then managed term set.\n\n376\n00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:06.470\nI want the Acme Management Service.\n\n377\n00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:09.440\nAnd I'll choose the departments.\n\n378\n00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:15.045\nTerm set group, no fill in choices\nallowed, no default value and okay.\n\n379\n00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:19.760\nAll right.\n\n380\n00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.690\nLet's see what this looks\nlike to the end user.\n\n381\n00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:23.468\nIt's all building to a climax.\n\n382\n00:23:23.468 --> 00:23:24.563\n[LAUGH] Stay tune.\n\n383\n00:23:24.563 --> 00:23:26.475\nThe anticipation is killing me.\n\n384\n00:23:26.475 --> 00:23:29.290\n[LAUGH] But I'm doing it.\n\n385\n00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:32.200\nOkay, so slide content type of invoice.\n\n386\n00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.439\nRemember slide content type is\nunique grouping of mandated fields.\n\n387\n00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:43.240\nThe supplier column and notice how we can\n\n388\n00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:48.090\nhave a hidden column as well if wanted\nparticularly using required or optional.\n\n389\n00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.380\nI'm going to propagate the change and\n\n390\n00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:58.980\nagain it message that we're\ngonna propagate the change.\n\n391\n00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:03.341\nAnd we'll see what that looks like,\ncoming up.\n\n392\n00:24:03.341 --> 00:24:07.877\nNow for Acme Departments,\nneed to make a change there.\n\n393\n00:24:07.877 --> 00:24:09.145\nGonna remove.\n\n394\n00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.418\nThe original settings there.\n\n395\n00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.813\nAnd now add from existing site columns.\n\n396\n00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.520\nRestrict by Acme columns.\n\n397\n00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.970\nAnd we can see our Acme department MMS,\navailable column, and\n\n398\n00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.922\nI'll click on Control and\nselect the supplier MMS.\n\n399\n00:24:37.355 --> 00:24:39.180\nOkay, I say yes, I'm sure.\n\n400\n00:24:40.292 --> 00:24:45.400\nAnd unless the default is update\nsite columns for consuming sites.\n\n401\n00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.390\nNow I'll manage publishing for\nthe content type.\n\n402\n00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.320\nAnd here now I have the un-publish and\nrepublish options.\n\n403\n00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.970\nIt's the change that I do want to\npropagate, so I'll choose republish.\n\n404\n00:25:01.929 --> 00:25:04.950\nOkay, there's my various options there.\n\n405\n00:25:06.644 --> 00:25:08.322\nFor department and supplier.\n\n406\n00:25:09.872 --> 00:25:13.360\nWe'll go back into monitoring, and\nI'll kick start this timer job.\n\n407\n00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.130\nBy going into timer job definitions.\n\n408\n00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:19.320\nScrolling down to content type subscriber.\n\n409\n00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:25.118\nThe one relating to,\nthe port 33333 site collection.\n\n410\n00:25:25.118 --> 00:25:26.500\nRun now.\n\n411\n00:25:29.911 --> 00:25:31.526\nAnd, content type.\n\n412\n00:25:31.526 --> 00:25:33.488\nGo back to that site collection.\n\n413\n00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.731\nGo to my Acme Product Catalog site.\n\n414\n00:25:44.992 --> 00:25:49.908\nIn the Documents library,\ngo to the Library tab up top and\n\n415\n00:25:49.908 --> 00:25:56.780\nI want Library settings which is over on\nalmost the far right side of the ribbon.\n\n416\n00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:02.770\nNow, the crucial setting here,\nallow management of content types, yes.\n\n417\n00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:06.170\nOtherwise, we're not gonna get any\nbenefit from all these demoing.\n\n418\n00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:07.170\n>> There's all for not.\n\n419\n00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.330\n>> Yes, we don't want that\n>> We wanna offer something.\n\n420\n00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.740\nOkay.\nI'll add it from existing site content\n\n421\n00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.980\ntypes.\n\n422\n00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:20.030\nSo we're gonna setup this site to consume\n\n423\n00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:26.860\nfrom a content type we published\nat the content type hub,\n\n424\n00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:31.910\nsite collection Okay.\n\n425\n00:26:35.822 --> 00:26:39.630\nNotice there's some other settings here\nwhich we just don't have time to get into.\n\n426\n00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:40.590\nMaybe another course.\n\n427\n00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.570\nThere's so many layers of training for\nSharePoint.\n\n428\n00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:45.120\nThere's sort of an intermediate admin,\n\n429\n00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.100\nlike a site collection administrator\ntraining, there's end user training.\n\n430\n00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.724\nSo, I have to force myself\nto not go down that tunnel.\n\n431\n00:26:51.724 --> 00:26:54.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a different user population.\n\n432\n00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.610\nAlthough, as admins, we're users as well.\n\n433\n00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.457\nSo it never hurts for the farm admins\nto also get end user training and\n\n434\n00:27:00.457 --> 00:27:03.515\nsite collection administrator training.\n\n435\n00:27:03.515 --> 00:27:06.300\nOkay, finally, so\nnow we're going to add a document.\n\n436\n00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.360\nI can choose the content type options\nthere from the ones I've associated with\n\n437\n00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.060\nthe site collection.\n\n438\n00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.170\nI'll choose the invoice content type.\n\n439\n00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.430\nAnd here are those fields and\nthere are those columns we selected.\n\n440\n00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.730\nI have to give you a title for\nthe document.\n\n441\n00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.932\nAnd then notice those fields we created,\nin other words we added site columns for\n\n442\n00:27:24.932 --> 00:27:25.717\nPayment Amount.\n\n443\n00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:28.610\nPayment Due Date is a date field.\n\n444\n00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:36.170\nI could type in the date but I always\nlike to use the calendar icon there.\n\n445\n00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:37.070\n>> Yeah.\n\n446\n00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.920\n>> Little date picker.\n\n447\n00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:43.460\n>> Especially with dates different formats\nthey want a two number year, a four number\n\n448\n00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.540\nyear, slashes, dashes no spaces\n>> Right.\n\n449\n00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.300\n>> So the drop down's always\nthe safest way to go.\n\n450\n00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:49.980\n>> Right.\n\n451\n00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:53.400\nSo to the right now, there's little tags I\ndon't know if you can see on the screen,\n\n452\n00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.730\nbut there are little icons for tags.\n\n453\n00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.810\nAnd notice that I'm constrained in\nmy choices there for the department.\n\n454\n00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:02.650\nSo one of four departments, and for\n\n455\n00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:08.500\nthe supplier I'm constrained to one\nof the five suppliers I've entered.\n\n456\n00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.430\nFor example, lions.\n\n457\n00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:12.830\nAnd both those names resolve\nbecause they're underlined.\n\n458\n00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:17.570\nSo that's how you could restrict\nmetadata field entry for the end users.\n\n459\n00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:21.930\nWe can constrain them to a list of\nterms that we've already specified.\n\n460\n00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:24.050\nFor example, supplier.\n\n461\n00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:27.900\nAnd we can also have a combination of\nother fields where there is free form\n\n462\n00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.440\ntext entry allowed or date, currency.\n\n463\n00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.530\nThere's even a calculated column\noption which is pretty cool.\n\n464\n00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.090\nDidn't show you that, but\nthere's lots to explore.\n\n465\n00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:37.830\n>> Very good, Mark.\n\n466\n00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:41.000\nAll right, a lot of great information\nthere on managing our metadata,\n\n467\n00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.640\ncreating those content types,\ndefining our columns, defining all that,\n\n468\n00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.610\nmaking sure we get it published, sent\nout to all the sites that are consuming\n\n469\n00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:52.920\nthat information from\nthe site collection itself.\n\n470\n00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.500\nAnd doing it,\n\n471\n00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:57.610\nso thereby doing it in a centralized way,\nwe don't have to do it for every site.\n\n472\n00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:02.000\nTaking advantage of that hierarchy between\nthe site collections and the site.\n\n473\n00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.010\nSo thank you for that,\ngreat demonstration.\n\n474\n00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:06.240\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching that one.\n\n475\n00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.880\nSigning out for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n476\n00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.450\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n477\n00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:11.128\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n478\n00:29:11.128 -->

00:00:20.214\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.214 --> 00:00:24.980\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be taking a look at managing\n\n5\n00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.930\nuser profiles within SharePoint,\nas well as audiences.\n\n6\n00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.960\nSo here to help us with that is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n7\n00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.712\nHow's it going, Mark?\n\n8\n00:00:31.712 --> 00:00:33.690\n>> Good Mike, thanks very much.\n\n9\n00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.980\nSo in SharePoint, we have the ability to\ncapture far more information about our\n\n10\n00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.930\nusers than we could in a strictly\nActive Directory world.\n\n11\n00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.420\nBut rather than recreate or\nduplicate fields like name,\n\n12\n00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.810\nphone number, address, etc.,\nwe're gonna import that information\n\n13\n00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.030\nabout our users from Active Directory and\nthen we can add to it as well.\n\n14\n00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.372\nSo that's user profile service\napplications, we're gonna synchronize,\n\n15\n00:01:02.372 --> 00:01:04.787\nand I'll show you how\nto do that right now.\n\n16\n00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:14.252\nI'm in my Active Directory Admin Center\non my DC and\n\n17\n00:01:14.252 --> 00:01:19.039\nI'm gonna go and create a New > User.\n\n18\n00:01:22.012 --> 00:01:26.290\nThis will be my Profile Service.\n\n19\n00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.054\n>> Very good.\n\n20\n00:01:31.804 --> 00:01:36.674\nFamiliar Active Directory Administrative\nCenter screen that we've come to know and\n\n21\n00:01:36.674 --> 00:01:38.530\nlove throughout this course.\n\n22\n00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.661\n>> Indeed.\n>> And it's funny,\n\n23\n00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:44.160\nyou talk about this being your,\nI think you said, you're gonna like this.\n\n24\n00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.304\nI find myself sometimes having\nto make myself go over there,\n\n25\n00:01:47.304 --> 00:01:50.213\ncuz like you said,\nyou can do a few more things in there.\n\n26\n00:01:50.213 --> 00:01:52.910\nOld school, I love my\nActive Directory Users and Computers, but\n\n27\n00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.019\nit's probably gonna be going away, so-\n>> No.\n\n28\n00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:56.943\n>> You gotta get used to this new console.\n\n29\n00:01:56.943 --> 00:01:59.150\nYeah, cuz it's not PowerShell\nbased like this one is, so\n\n30\n00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.770\nI think most of the management tools\nwill end up being PowerShell based.\n\n31\n00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.820\n>> Good point.\n\n32\n00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:11.170\nSo we're creating a service account here\nfor our user profile import, I hit OK.\n\n33\n00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.927\nNow I have to do something else as well,\nI have to grant my farm admin account\n\n34\n00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:19.411\na permission called\nReplicating Directory Changes.\n\n35\n00:02:25.172 --> 00:02:28.872\nSo we'll go down under extensions here,\nclick on Add.\n\n36\n00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.592\nI'll type in the first few characters\nof my farm admin account, my SP admin.\n\n37\n00:02:42.134 --> 00:02:45.618\nNotice here, there's other settings\nwe can apply, which I'm not going to.\n\n38\n00:02:45.618 --> 00:02:49.437\nBut again,\nwhenever you're in a dialog box like this,\n\n39\n00:02:49.437 --> 00:02:53.431\nor some kind of wizard,\nit's usual just to scan through.\n\n40\n00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:56.916\nSo that's the settings I need to make,\nthe Replicating Directory Changes, but\n\n41\n00:02:56.916 --> 00:02:58.500\nI don't need to set any others.\n\n42\n00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.079\nBut hey, check the options available,\ndon't click them all indiscriminately,\n\n43\n00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.676\nbut at least know what's possible.\n\n44\n00:03:03.676 --> 00:03:07.650\nIt will feed into your brain, some of\nthe schema related information, and\n\n45\n00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.804\nthen down the road,\nif you need to configure something, or\n\n46\n00:03:10.804 --> 00:03:14.806\nsomeone asks if this is possible,\nyou'll have it in the back of your mind.\n\n47\n00:03:14.806 --> 00:03:18.968\nOkay, yes, there is this built in field,\nfor example, or permission,\n\n48\n00:03:18.968 --> 00:03:21.990\nor setting in Active Directory I can use.\n\n49\n00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.593\nAll right, so now I'm back to my Central\nAdmin and we've seen this movie before\n\n50\n00:03:26.593 --> 00:03:29.903\na lot as well,\nwe're gonna register a managed account.\n\n51\n00:03:29.903 --> 00:03:34.593\nThis will be for\nmy Acme profile service account.\n\n52\n00:03:34.593 --> 00:03:37.224\n>> So this account is what\nSharePoint's gonna use to reach out\n\n53\n00:03:37.224 --> 00:03:39.655\nthe Active Directory and\npull that information back?\n\n54\n00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:40.449\n>> Right.\n\n55\n00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:41.019\n>> Very good.\n\n56\n00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:50.039\n>> And okay, I won't store the password.\n\n57\n00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.535\nAnd I'll go into System Settings and\nI wanna manage services on server.\n\n58\n00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.037\nSo as my user profile service,\nit says started, but\n\n59\n00:04:10.037 --> 00:04:14.010\nI like to restart if it was stopped and\nI then start it.\n\n60\n00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.260\nAnd a warning, do I wanna continue?\n\n61\n00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.655\nIs this the service you want to restart?\n\n62\n00:04:17.655 --> 00:04:21.890\nIn other words,\nthat's nice to confirm that, hit OK.\n\n63\n00:04:24.426 --> 00:04:28.231\nAnd now,\nI'm gonna go into Application Management.\n\n64\n00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:34.889\nAnd Manage service applications.\n\n65\n00:04:41.623 --> 00:04:43.922\nWait for that to load.\n\n66\n00:04:43.922 --> 00:04:46.546\nA little circle on the tab there,\nso you know something's happening.\n\n67\n00:04:46.546 --> 00:04:51.257\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Then I want a New >\n\n68\n00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:54.097\nUser Profile Service Application.\n\n69\n00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.762\nWorking on it.\n\n70\n00:04:58.762 --> 00:05:01.038\nAnd I'll fill out this form here.\n\n71\n00:05:01.038 --> 00:05:05.542\nSo, this will be AcmeUPSA.\n\n72\n00:05:09.594 --> 00:05:11.110\nGive an application pool name.\n\n73\n00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.814\nThis will be the AcmeUPSAAppPool.\n\n74\n00:05:18.294 --> 00:05:23.136\nAnd as you probably guessed we're\ngonna use the profile service account\n\n75\n00:05:23.136 --> 00:05:27.433\nwe just created for this purpose\nto interact with that app pool.\n\n76\n00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:28.733\nAnd Create.\n\n77\n00:05:31.636 --> 00:05:35.049\nThat worked as expected.\n\n78\n00:05:35.049 --> 00:05:36.605\nSo I'll click on OK.\n\n79\n00:05:40.021 --> 00:05:46.653\nNow, let's make sure that the AcmeUPSA\n\n80\n00:05:46.653 --> 00:05:52.513\nservice app exists, scroll down,\n\n81\n00:06:00.924 --> 00:06:03.360\nAnd it's there, excellent.\n\n82\n00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.600\nSo now we've created a new instance of\nthe user profile service application.\n\n83\n00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.273\nNext up, we're gonna configure\nthe directory import.\n\n84\n00:06:13.747 --> 00:06:17.105\nSo it'll be an import only\nsynchronization, in other words, there's\n\n85\n00:06:17.105 --> 00:06:21.400\nno synchronization gonna happen between\nour SharePoint farm and Active Directory.\n\n86\n00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.420\nWe're only pulling in fields\nfrom Active Directory.\n\n87\n00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.218\n>> One-way then.\n\n88\n00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.797\n>> Yeah, one-way process, exactly.\n\n89\n00:06:33.167 --> 00:06:36.834\nOkay, so\nnow we're in the Manage Profile Service.\n\n90\n00:06:36.834 --> 00:06:41.458\nRemember, sometimes you click on a link\nthat has a certain name and the page title\n\n91\n00:06:41.458 --> 00:06:45.565\nthat you land on has a slightly\ndifferent name, this can be confusing.\n\n92\n00:06:45.565 --> 00:06:47.684\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n93\n00:06:47.684 --> 00:06:52.322\nwe need the SharePoint Active Directory\nImport, which is the default.\n\n94\n00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.940\nNow I need to configure\na connection to Active Directory.\n\n95\n00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.600\nSo I'll click on\nConfigure Synchronization Connections.\n\n96\n00:07:07.863 --> 00:07:09.024\nCreate a New Connection.\n\n97\n00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:18.410\nAnd this will be, Acme.\n\n98\n00:07:22.111 --> 00:07:23.109\nDomain.\n\n99\n00:07:28.468 --> 00:07:29.861\nAnd acme.com.\n\n100\n00:07:34.466 --> 00:07:36.146\nWe specify the account to use.\n\n101\n00:07:43.507 --> 00:07:49.072\nWhich will be my farm account,\nmy AcmeSPadmin account.\n\n102\n00:07:49.072 --> 00:07:50.647\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Put in the password.\n\n103\n00:07:54.126 --> 00:07:55.288\nAnd confirm it.\n\n104\n00:08:00.925 --> 00:08:04.185\nConfirm password boxes seem like a hassle,\nbut they actually can save you.\n\n105\n00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:05.610\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, they can.\n\n106\n00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:10.280\n>> Especially if you caps lock on,\nfor example, you didn't realize it.\n\n107\n00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.275\nAnd I'll click on\nthe Populate Containers button.\n\n108\n00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:20.310\nAnd there's my Acme object there,\nI'll expand it.\n\n109\n00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.010\nAnd you can see your\nvarious categories here.\n\n110\n00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.160\nComputers, DCs, et cetera,\nthat's all I wanted to see.\n\n111\n00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.230\n>> So you'd verify and can successfully\nreach out, talk to active directory, and\n\n112\n00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.390\nthere's all your OUs or\nbuilt-in containers.\n\n113\n00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:34.100\n>> Exactly.\n\n114\n00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.870\n>> Nice.\n\n115\n00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.130\n>> From which we'll be\nimporting information.\n\n116\n00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.300\nNow, I'll click on, I'm going\nback into Application Management,\n\n117\n00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.290\nbecause I'm gonna configure\nprofile synchronization.\n\n118\n00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:50.940\nSo, I'll go back into manage service apps\nand scroll down to my Acme UPSA accounts.\n\n119\n00:08:57.121 --> 00:09:01.574\nAnd under synchronization, I want to\nconfigure the synchronization timer job.\n\n120\n00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.527\nAnd Edit Timer Job here, I'll scroll down,\nyou can see the job scheduled to run every\n\n121\n00:09:10.527 --> 00:09:14.162\nfive minutes and just wanted to\nmake sure that the disable button\n\n122\n00:09:14.162 --> 00:09:18.090\nappeared at the button which it did\nthat means it is already enabled.\n\n123\n00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.440\nIf it was disabled,\nthe enabled button would appear,\n\n124\n00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.180\njust possibly counter intuitive but the\npoint is, it's set the way it should be.\n\n125\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.260\nThere's also the run now option there\nwhich we've seen from another timer jobs\n\n126\n00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.160\nand different episodes in order to kick\nstart a timer job rather than to wait to\n\n127\n00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.120\nwhat's next normal kick off time\nwhich could be minutes, hours,\n\n128\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:37.910\ndays or weeks away.\n\n129\n00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.210\nYou can get it going faster.\n\n130\n00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:48.250\nAll right, back into my, this time I want\nthe to start profile synchronization.\n\n131\n00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.670\nNow we could do incremental or full.\n\n132\n00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.060\nIt's always good to start with a full.\n\n133\n00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:57.880\nAnd then you can rely\non incremental syncs.\n\n134\n00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.960\nSometimes though just like with repairing\nan index it's impossible to do.\n\n135\n00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.203\nIts prohibitively time consuming,\nsometimes it is easier just to start over,\n\n136\n00:10:07.203 --> 00:10:09.881\nso that would be a reason\nto use a full crawl again.\n\n137\n00:10:09.881 --> 00:10:12.710\nAll right, so\neven though we started synchronization and\n\n138\n00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:15.539\nthe profile sync status shows idle,\ndon't be confused,\n\n139\n00:10:15.539 --> 00:10:18.500\nit'll take a a lot to populate,\nespecially the first time.\n\n140\n00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.930\nSo you'll have to come back to the screen\nrefresh, we're not gonna wait around for\n\n141\n00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.760\nthat right now, but I will point out,\nwe can see after a compilation has run\n\n142\n00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.078\nsuccessfully, there is\nthe last compilation time.\n\n143\n00:10:28.078 --> 00:10:31.390\nOn the right-hand side there,\nwe can see what the schedule is.\n\n144\n00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.930\nMaybe you wanna modify that.\n\n145\n00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:37.110\nAgain, there's so many activities that\nhappen in the life of an organization.\n\n146\n00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.670\nDifferent network admins, SQL admins,\netc., each with backup schedules,\n\n147\n00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:45.220\nmaintenance windows, so\nyou might have to tweak that time.\n\n148\n00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.820\nAnd you find out by measuring.\n\n149\n00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.020\nYou're measuring performance impact and\nthen you'll know,\n\n150\n00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.750\nokay, I can move some of these timer jobs.\n\n151\n00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.130\nAnd have them occur at different times.\n\n152\n00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.150\nSo you have that flexibility.\n\n153\n00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.460\nAnd right now we have a 15\norganization properties and\n\n154\n00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.900\none organization profile,\nand 109 user properties.\n\n155\n00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:06.350\nSo the other thing is you may decide\nover time that you don't need to import\n\n156\n00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.200\nall the fields from Active Directory\nthat you originally started with.\n\n157\n00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.910\nSo it's the principle.\n\n158\n00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.420\nIf you don't need the content or\nthe fields, don't import them.\n\n159\n00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.230\nIt doesn't add any value.\n\n160\n00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.550\nIf later on you'll realize you wanna\ndiscuss the field that we just created,\n\n161\n00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.280\nwe extended or scheme on,\nadded new field, and added directory.\n\n162\n00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.560\nThen, you can look in importing\nthat into the SharePoint context if\n\n163\n00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.970\nit makes sense to do that.\n\n164\n00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:33.320\nBesides, all this here we have all\nkinds of SharePoint unique properties.\n\n165\n00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.770\nLike hobbies, schools, etc,\nwhich will be covered in an other episode.\n\n166\n00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.410\nSo that's all for this little demo.\n\n167\n00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:46.330\nNow we're going to transition into\nconfiguring My Sites and audiences.\n\n168\n00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.450\nSo we talked about the rationale for\n\n169\n00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.580\nMy Sites, some organizations love them,\nsome hate them.\n\n170\n00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.130\nSo I'll show you how to enable\nself service site creation.\n\n171\n00:11:56.130 --> 00:12:00.560\nAnd then the benefit of audiences so they\ncan target information to specific users\n\n172\n00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:06.970\nor groups to get more relevant content on\nsay, an internet page or a team site page.\n\n173\n00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:11.920\nYou want to get people participating\nIn a SharePoint context and\n\n174\n00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.160\nlooking forward to go into that page,\nmaybe bookmarking it.\n\n175\n00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.390\nMaybe it's their homepage.\n\n176\n00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.140\nWell, one way to do that is to make\nsure you have timely information.\n\n177\n00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.550\nSo we don't want to hear\nabout last summer's picnic.\n\n178\n00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:24.090\nEspecially since you can schedule\npublishing to disappear from\n\n179\n00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.240\na site at a certain time.\n\n180\n00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.080\nSo it has to be relevant and\ntimely information and useful.\n\n181\n00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.900\nSo for all those reasons we're\ngoing to use audience targeting.\n\n182\n00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:39.180\nLet's get into that now.\n\n183\n00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.420\nI'm going to go into my active\ndirectory admin center.\n\n184\n00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.880\nActually, I just wanted to\nsee one more time if we could\n\n185\n00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.020\nget the sync status to show but.\n\n186\n00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:55.480\nIt's taking its own sweet time, so\nwe'll forget about that for now.\n\n187\n00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.053\nAll right, so back into A deck here, and\n\n188\n00:12:58.053 --> 00:13:01.854\nwe're gonna create an application\npool service account.\n\n189\n00:13:04.537 --> 00:13:05.610\nAgain.\n\n190\n00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:06.525\n>> I should say.\n\n191\n00:13:06.525 --> 00:13:09.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We create a client view users anyway.\n\n192\n00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:10.190\n>> Man.\n\n193\n00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.200\nIn service accounts and alike.\n\n194\n00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.830\nSo my sites application pool.\n\n195\n00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.390\nIt makes sense to segment out\nmy sites into their own pool for\n\n196\n00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.040\nmanagement reasons and security reasons.\n\n197\n00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.440\nNow you may have more than\none my sites trusted host.\n\n198\n00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.540\nI like to use the example,\nEurope and North America.\n\n199\n00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.510\nTypically there's political considerations\nor valid reasons that you want to have.\n\n200\n00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.480\nMore localized admins, responsible, for\n\n201\n00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.440\nthe content of those\ndifferent application pools.\n\n202\n00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.220\nBut for this we're going to use, it's\na one size fits all or one app pool for\n\n203\n00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.540\nall the Mysites, in our organization.\n\n204\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.210\nSo, password never expires,\nuser cannot change password.\n\n205\n00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.750\nAnd, ok.\n\n206\n00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.995\nAnd if your watching along you can\nguess the next thing were going to do.\n\n207\n00:13:56.995 --> 00:13:59.890\n[LAUGH] That's right,\nwere gonna register a manage account.\n\n208\n00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.580\nThat's going to security and\n\n209\n00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:15.481\nthen configure manage account\nRegister managed account.\n\n210\n00:14:18.301 --> 00:14:19.277\nEnter the credentials there.\n\n211\n00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.985\nMaking sure I selected the right box.\n\n212\n00:14:28.985 --> 00:14:31.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Always helps.\n\n213\n00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:31.760\n>> Indeed.\n\n214\n00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.870\nAll right.\nSometimes the cursor appears there but\n\n215\n00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.320\nit's not actually set there.\n\n216\n00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.810\nSo you can be typing without realizing,\nmy letters aren't showing on the screen.\n\n217\n00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:42.620\nThat can be annoying.\n\n218\n00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.792\nAll right, so I enter the password.\n\n219\n00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:57.690\nScroll down and okay, and\ndon't wanna remember the password.\n\n220\n00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.510\nGo into Application Management again.\n\n221\n00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.216\nIn there now, and Manage Web Apps.\n\n222\n00:15:03.155 --> 00:15:04.397\nAnd I want a new-\n\n223\n00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:23.260\n>> So this way we're going to segregate\n\n224\n00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.130\nout from everything else\nall the team site stuff.\n\n225\n00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:27.370\n>> Exactly.\n>> I'm sorry, not the team site, but\n\n226\n00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:28.680\nthe my sites.\n\n227\n00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.060\nRight, well from all the other\ncontent exactly, yeah.\n\n228\n00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:34.862\nSo create a new web app here.\n\n229\n00:15:37.706 --> 00:15:39.050\nAnd I'll give it a port number.\n\n230\n00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:43.276\nAgain, I could use host headers and\nthen just create any record in DNS, but\n\n231\n00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:47.993\njust for kicks I'm gonna use port numbers\nto distinguish instead of a host header.\n\n232\n00:15:50.213 --> 00:15:51.570\nAnd scroll down here.\n\n233\n00:15:58.283 --> 00:16:00.401\nYou can see there,\ndatabase name being created.\n\n234\n00:16:02.693 --> 00:16:06.143\nI want a new application pool,\ninstead of joining a existing app pool.\n\n235\n00:16:06.143 --> 00:16:14.185\nI'll call this app pool SharePointMySites\nwith the port number selected earlier.\n\n236\n00:16:14.185 --> 00:16:16.719\nAnd I'll choose the service account,\n\n237\n00:16:16.719 --> 00:16:19.651\nI just created\nthe My Sites App Pool account.\n\n238\n00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.941\nAnd let's use the default\nconnections there and OK.\n\n239\n00:16:29.259 --> 00:16:31.540\nAnd that worked, so I'll hit OK there.\n\n240\n00:16:37.036 --> 00:16:40.912\nI'll go into that web app I just created.\n\n241\n00:16:40.912 --> 00:16:45.580\nI'm gonna set up a managed path so\n[COUGH] creating a space in the URL path.\n\n242\n00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.090\nWe're gonna call this path personal.\n\n243\n00:16:54.803 --> 00:16:59.259\nAnd while card inclusion is good and\nadd path.\n\n244\n00:17:02.125 --> 00:17:03.311\nAnd OK.\n\n245\n00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:14.898\nBack in Application Management,\nI'm gonna create a site collection.\n\n246\n00:17:14.898 --> 00:17:15.756\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n247\n00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:23.910\n>> Making sure I'm creating it in\nthe correct web app, which it is now.\n\n248\n00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:28.060\nSP01, with the five digit port number\nI just specified earlier, 19191.\n\n249\n00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.035\nI'll give it a title.\n\n250\n00:17:30.035 --> 00:17:33.300\n[COUGH] This will be my site host.\n\n251\n00:17:39.743 --> 00:17:43.792\nYeah, this will be\nthe enterprise template type and\n\n252\n00:17:43.792 --> 00:17:47.020\nit will be the my site host template type.\n\n253\n00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:58.570\nGive it a username Futzing around and\nhere, [COUGH].\n\n254\n00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:04.767\nThis my SP admin account and optional\nsecondary site collection administrator,\n\n255\n00:18:04.767 --> 00:18:10.080\nI'll leave that for now,\nwe'll create one, and then we'll hit OK.\n\n256\n00:18:25.847 --> 00:18:27.529\n>> This is just a refresh for everybody,\n\n257\n00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:29.850\nremember we got that\nhierarchy within Share Point.\n\n258\n00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.550\nWe got that web application\nwithin the web application.\n\n259\n00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:37.440\nWe got the site collections, and then\nwithin the site collections we'll have\n\n260\n00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.413\nthe individual, in this case, My Sites.\n\n261\n00:18:42.138 --> 00:18:45.969\n>> Yeah, so\nthat got created [COUGH] as expected.\n\n262\n00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:48.159\nNext up,\n\n263\n00:18:48.159 --> 00:18:53.046\nI want to set up my site settings for the\nuser profile service application instance.\n\n264\n00:19:00.129 --> 00:19:03.861\nSo I'll click on\n\n265\n00:19:03.861 --> 00:19:11.065\nSelf Service Site Creation On.\n\n266\n00:19:11.065 --> 00:19:12.998\nSo that magic radio button,\n\n267\n00:19:12.998 --> 00:19:18.210\nnow you're unleashing a lot of power\nthere, by selecting that button.\n\n268\n00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:24.580\nAnd then, you have the option to\nshow that link, so users, it makes\n\n269\n00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.980\nit even easier for them to create it,\nbecause they say, what's this button for?\n\n270\n00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.550\nOoh, exciting, use the power wisely.\n\n271\n00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:37.210\nAnd then we can require them to classify\nthe sites they create, categorizing by\n\n272\n00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:42.039\nwhatever you want, division,\nregion, departments.\n\n273\n00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.560\nNow I'll go back into\nManage Service Applications.\n\n274\n00:19:57.323 --> 00:19:58.888\nBack into AcmeUPSA.\n\n275\n00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.788\nAnd Setup My Sites.\n\n276\n00:20:13.139 --> 00:20:16.792\nI can have a preferred\nsearch center if I want.\n\n277\n00:20:16.792 --> 00:20:17.827\nSo in other words,\n\n278\n00:20:17.827 --> 00:20:22.119\nit's a landing page when users are\nsearching from their My Site profile page.\n\n279\n00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.345\nFor now I'll set up\na My Site host location.\n\n280\n00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:36.300\nSo we're restricting on which server\nusers can set up their My Sites.\n\n281\n00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.690\nAn option there whether to make\nthe My Sites public or not.\n\n282\n00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.597\nUsers have control over\nthe privacy settings there.\n\n283\n00:20:51.244 --> 00:20:56.432\nGo back into Application Management,\nManage Service Apps.\n\n284\n00:21:01.007 --> 00:21:02.424\nAcme UPSA\n\n285\n00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.092\nGo back into this My Site settings here.\n\n286\n00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.434\nOr will I?\n\n287\n00:21:22.434 --> 00:21:23.664\nThat is the question.\n\n288\n00:21:31.218 --> 00:21:33.053\nLets go to monitoring now.\n\n289\n00:21:33.053 --> 00:21:37.918\n[COUGH] And review job definitions.\n\n290\n00:21:45.445 --> 00:21:47.453\nMy activity feed job.\n\n291\n00:21:52.067 --> 00:21:54.150\nWant to make sure that is enabled.\n\n292\n00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:57.139\nRemember, we can populate\ncontent on user's my sites.\n\n293\n00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.760\nBy setting it up once and it will\nautomatically show up on their feed.\n\n294\n00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.940\nSo it's great in terms of\nthe power of customization and\n\n295\n00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.400\ncommunicating to users\nthrough a variety of methods.\n\n296\n00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:10.930\n>> Very cool.\n\n297\n00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.651\n>> I'm going to mange audiences now.\n\n298\n00:22:14.091 --> 00:22:18.419\n[COUGH] So audiences are a way of\nservicing information that's relevant to\n\n299\n00:22:18.419 --> 00:22:20.560\nthat user or group.\n\n300\n00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.040\nWe can define audience multiple ways.\n\n301\n00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:28.380\nIt can be by any field, for example,\njob title, a city they're located in,\n\n302\n00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:32.720\nyears of service, classification ID,\nwhatever you can dream up.\n\n303\n00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.770\nIt can even be a combination of\nfields that can define an audience.\n\n304\n00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:42.600\nSo, say, managers in the western region\nwould see a certain web part say,\n\n305\n00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.470\nor certain news item,\nwhereas others would not.\n\n306\n00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:48.130\nSo these are all the different\nways you can restrict or\n\n307\n00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:53.140\ncreate an audience, again,\nby location, by managers.\n\n308\n00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.230\nMaybe you're going to targeting\ncontent to everyone who has\n\n309\n00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.980\nthe same manager, for example.\n\n310\n00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.330\nMaybe it's communication for\n\n311\n00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:01.450\nthe manager that they want\nall the team members to see.\n\n312\n00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:02.700\nSo I'm doing something a little unusual,\n\n313\n00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.350\ninstead of creating a group I'm creating\nan audience with a person in it.\n\n314\n00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:10.500\nSo it is literally micro\ntargeted to gin only.\n\n315\n00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:14.700\nThen I can click on compile audience.\n\n316\n00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.480\nI have the ability to edit\nthe audience rules at any time.\n\n317\n00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.040\nBut typically we would use\na group I'm just being creative.\n\n318\n00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.146\nCreative license if you will.\n\n319\n00:23:24.146 --> 00:23:28.730\nAnd targeting the user as an audience,\nan audience of one.\n\n320\n00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:36.292\nBack into application management,\n\n321\n00:23:36.292 --> 00:23:41.554\nthere's service apps,\nscroll down, and AcmeUPSA.\n\n322\n00:23:41.554 --> 00:23:46.223\nBack in the manage audiences again,\nI'm going to add another audience and\n\n323\n00:23:46.223 --> 00:23:50.380\nthis time gonna target\nsomeone individually again.\n\n324\n00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:57.389\nThis will be Ray,\nspecify a site owner here,\n\n325\n00:23:57.389 --> 00:24:02.190\nor an audience owner, and OK.\n\n326\n00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.890\nAgain, I'll choose\nthe first name property.\n\n327\n00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:12.935\nThere's boolean operators there,\nI'll just say equals, and\n\n328\n00:24:12.935 --> 00:24:18.989\nRay, and compile audience.\n\n329\n00:24:25.835 --> 00:24:29.880\nNow it's good to have a compilation\nschedule, because let's say you're\n\n330\n00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.246\ntargeting by department, well if it's\na large organization there maybe people\n\n331\n00:24:34.246 --> 00:24:37.350\nmoving in and out of that\ndepartment once or twice a week.\n\n332\n00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:40.060\nSo you wanna make sure\nthat your targeting.\n\n333\n00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:44.110\nThe audience is up to date, and\nwe can do this by recalibrating, or\n\n334\n00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:48.570\nrecalculating if you will,\nthe audience memberships.\n\n335\n00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:55.050\nSo in this case, at 1 AM,\nthe audience populations will be accurate.\n\n336\n00:24:55.050 --> 00:25:00.060\nAny changes made after 1 AM won't get\nreflected in the audience makeup until\n\n337\n00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.680\nthe next compilation schedule has run.\n\n338\n00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.440\n>> Very good, Mark.\n\n339\n00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.630\nAll right, a really good look there at\nhow we can manage those user profiles,\n\n340\n00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:10.430\nget their information out\nof active directory, so\n\n341\n00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:12.730\nwe don't have to re-key that information,\nright?\n\n342\n00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.160\nWe know that SharePoint stores a lot\nmore information about our users\n\n343\n00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.810\nthan active directory does.\n\n344\n00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:21.360\nBut why re-enter things that\nare already stored in active directory,\n\n345\n00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.160\nso we set that up We also got to see\nhow to create those audiences, so\n\n346\n00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.810\nwe can target information right?\n\n347\n00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:31.440\nBut push things out to their MySites\nbased on certain criteria we set up\n\n348\n00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.660\nin those audience rules.\n\n349\n00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.830\nSo very good stuff.\n\n350\n00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.710\nThank you for\nthose demonstrations there Mark.\n\n351\n00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:37.750\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n352\n00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.410\nSigning off for IT Pro TV.\n\n353\n00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:40.370\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n354\n00:25:40.370 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:14.841\nHello, and welcome to another\nexciting episode here it ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:16.810\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.600\nToday we're doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.790\nAnd specifically, in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.220\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\nconfiguring our Enterprise search.\n\n7\n00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.630\nNow we took a look at doing\nour SharePoint online,\n\n8\n00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.990\nconfiguring Search there,\nnow we want to bring it on-premise and\n\n9\n00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.320\ntake a look at configuring our\nEnterprise Search capabilities.\n\n10\n00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.490\nAnd here to walk us through\nall that is Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n11\n00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.450\nHow's it going Mark?\n\n12\n00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.520\n>> Good Mike, thanks very much.\n\n13\n00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.150\nKeep in mind my usual caveat\nabout SharePoint Search.\n\n14\n00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.820\nThere is literally a week's\nworth of training potential\n\n15\n00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.640\njust on configuring SharePoint Search,\n\n16\n00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.320\nwhether online or on-prem, so we're\nnot gonna cover absolutely everything.\n\n17\n00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.130\nIf I whet your appetite and\nencourage you to explore more and\n\n18\n00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.640\nlearn on your own,\nmaybe get involved in the labs,\n\n19\n00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.210\ncheck it out in a safe test environment,\nthen I've done my job.\n\n20\n00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.513\nSo let's look at a lot of\nthe functionality that's built into\n\n21\n00:01:10.513 --> 00:01:12.428\nthe Enterprise version of Search.\n\n22\n00:01:15.746 --> 00:01:20.828\nYeah, all right, so now I'm back in\nmy familiar Server Manager console.\n\n23\n00:01:20.828 --> 00:01:24.308\nI'll fire up ADAC, the Active\nDirectory Administrative Center.\n\n24\n00:01:27.408 --> 00:01:28.888\nCopyright 2013.\n\n25\n00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:32.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so remember,\n\n26\n00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.600\nyou can do a bunch of things here that\nyou can do in AD Users and Computers, but\n\n27\n00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.333\nyou can do more from ADAC, so that's\nthe preferred way to go, where possible.\n\n28\n00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:43.238\nI'll scroll down there and\nselect in my acme domain.\n\n29\n00:01:43.238 --> 00:01:46.896\nAnd to go into users, we need to\nset up some search accounts first.\n\n30\n00:01:46.896 --> 00:01:51.656\nDon't get lazy and just use your\nstandard administrator account.\n\n31\n00:01:51.656 --> 00:01:52.756\n>> Your administrator account,\nyeah [LAUGH].\n\n32\n00:01:52.756 --> 00:01:57.822\n>> I mean, maybe if it's a lab\nenvironment, fine, but you should be used\n\n33\n00:01:57.822 --> 00:02:03.760\nto the activity of creating multiple\nservice accounts for different reasons.\n\n34\n00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.920\nAnd now with the managed\naccount capabilities,\n\n35\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.720\nthis one'll be SPSearch,\nwith the ability to use managed accounts,\n\n36\n00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.800\nMicrosoft Windows takes care\nof changing passwords for you.\n\n37\n00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.480\nSo if you're worried about the hassle of\nchanging passwords, and that's why you're\n\n38\n00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.150\nusing one or a couple of accounts,\nyou don't have that concern anymore.\n\n39\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.890\nSo, set up right from the beginning,\nset up different service accounts for\n\n40\n00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.660\ndifferent reasons.\n\n41\n00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.145\nAlso helps you with troubleshooting.\n\n42\n00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.690\nI'll set up another account here,\nSPSearchAdmin.\n\n43\n00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.799\nSo, yeah, if you're looking at the event\nviewer for example, parsing logs there,\n\n44\n00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.200\nhaving the service account name associated\nwith a particular task and activity really\n\n45\n00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.200\nhelps you filter and\nnarrow down what the issue might be.\n\n46\n00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.300\nIf you have one account\ndoing multiple tasks,\n\n47\n00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.020\nit's gonna be a lot of noise when\nyou're looking at the event log.\n\n48\n00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.830\nA lot of compelling reasons to do,\nand create, multiple accounts.\n\n49\n00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.048\nSo that's my SPSearchAdmin.\n\n50\n00:03:04.048 --> 00:03:06.108\nGot a few more to do here.\n\n51\n00:03:06.108 --> 00:03:13.160\nThis one will be SPSearchQuery.\n\n52\n00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.840\nHopefully, your typing improves\nas your life as an administrator.\n\n53\n00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.790\nHopefully, you're not gonna do hunt and\npeck, one or two finger approach.\n\n54\n00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.748\nMy typing's certainly improved.\n\n55\n00:03:21.748 --> 00:03:28.408\nOkay, search query, usual password.\n\n56\n00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:31.008\nI wonder if anyone tries to make\na password using all asterisks?\n\n57\n00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:35.228\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Probably wouldn't work [LAUGH].\n\n58\n00:03:35.228 --> 00:03:37.348\nJust asking, okay\n>> Not enough complexity there.\n\n59\n00:03:37.348 --> 00:03:39.808\n>> Yeah, that's good point,\nthat's a good point.\n\n60\n00:03:39.808 --> 00:03:41.528\nOkay, so password never expires.\n\n61\n00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:45.428\nAnd one more.\n\n62\n00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:56.768\nThis one I'm gonna call SPContentAccess\n\n63\n00:04:05.108 --> 00:04:06.729\n>> Yeah, sometimes it can seem a little\n\n64\n00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:10.548\ntedious creating all these accounts, but\nit really, as Mark said, there's several\n\n65\n00:04:10.548 --> 00:04:14.264\nbenefits of doing it, especially now with\nthe managed service accounts where we can\n\n66\n00:04:14.264 --> 00:04:17.300\nlet Windows take care of it if we need to,\nfor the password.\n\n67\n00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.550\nAnd it follows the principle\nof least privilege, right.\n\n68\n00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.568\nWe've talked about that\nin several other shows.\n\n69\n00:04:22.568 --> 00:04:25.131\nYou don't want one account\ngetting compromised, and\n\n70\n00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:27.648\ncompromising the entire service or\nother services.\n\n71\n00:04:27.648 --> 00:04:30.828\nIf you've used that account in other\nplaces, it can get real nasty, so\n\n72\n00:04:30.828 --> 00:04:33.680\nfollow that principle of least privilege.\n\n73\n00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.000\n>> Indeed.\n\n74\n00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.320\nAll right, so in this course, we've showed\nyou a variety of ways to do things,\n\n75\n00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.115\nboth from a central admin site,\n\n76\n00:04:44.115 --> 00:04:49.170\nvarious GUI options, SharePoint online.\n\n77\n00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.274\nBut it's important to learn how\nto do things using PowerShell,\n\n78\n00:04:52.274 --> 00:04:55.710\nas well, because PowerShell is gonna\nbecome more and more prevalent.\n\n79\n00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.850\nAnd, again, there's certain things\nyou can only do in PowerShell,\n\n80\n00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.930\nin this case the SharePoint\nmanagement shell,\n\n81\n00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.200\nwhich is Windows PowerShell with\nthe SharePoint command list loaded.\n\n82\n00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.444\nNotice though, we're just setting up\nthese accounts that I just created as\n\n83\n00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:16.040\na SharePoint managed account, so there's\na new SP managed account commandlet.\n\n84\n00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.095\nAnd it's kind of the old and the new.\n\n85\n00:05:18.095 --> 00:05:20.760\nSo when I'm creating\nthis new managed account,\n\n86\n00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.040\nit comes up with a familiar dialog box,\nwhere I can enter my credentials.\n\n87\n00:05:26.442 --> 00:05:30.324\nOoh, there's a sea of red ink, reminiscent\nof my high school English essays.\n\n88\n00:05:30.324 --> 00:05:32.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Coming back from the teacher.\n\n89\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.690\nI kind of did that on purpose,\nthough, just to show you that\n\n90\n00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.640\nyou get useful error messages\nin PowerShell often.\n\n91\n00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.590\nNot all the time, but the vast majority of\nthe time, and then you can usually figure\n\n92\n00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.200\nout what you did or didn't do that\ncaused that error to be generated.\n\n93\n00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.520\nFor example, mistyping a user name or\n\n94\n00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.360\npassword would, in this case,\ngive you that red ink response.\n\n95\n00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.360\nSo kudos to Microsoft for\ntheir work with PowerShell.\n\n96\n00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.990\nIt's really been a boon for\nadmins everywhere,\n\n97\n00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.860\nespecially those of us who aren't devs and\ndon't have a lot of scripting background.\n\n98\n00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.990\nThey made it really intuitive,\noften easy to learn and\n\n99\n00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.270\ntroubleshoot, and lots of built-in help\nand online help as well for PowerShell.\n\n100\n00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.990\nSo I am an unabashed fan of PowerShell.\n\n101\n00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.415\nThis has been a sponsored announcement.\n\n102\n00:06:26.415 --> 00:06:27.548\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, no sponsoring.\n\n103\n00:06:27.548 --> 00:06:31.828\nOkay, so I'm just doing the same thing for\nthese several accounts.\n\n104\n00:06:31.828 --> 00:06:36.415\nAnd now I'm done with my\nSharePoint management shell, so\n\n105\n00:06:36.415 --> 00:06:38.390\nI'll exit out of there.\n\n106\n00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.030\nNext up I want to provision a Search\nservice application instance.\n\n107\n00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.678\nSo, for this,\nI'll go to my trusty Central Admin site.\n\n108\n00:06:55.438 --> 00:06:59.277\nRemember, we use a five digit\nport number when we set up\n\n109\n00:06:59.277 --> 00:07:03.538\nSharePoint as a bit of security\nthrough obscurity, there.\n\n110\n00:07:03.538 --> 00:07:06.818\nSo I happened to choose 55555.\n\n111\n00:07:06.818 --> 00:07:11.780\nYou can choose any five digit port\nnumber that's not currently in use up\n\n112\n00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.858\nto 65,000, roughly.\n\n113\n00:07:13.858 --> 00:07:15.998\nSo I have to enter credentials\nto access the site.\n\n114\n00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:23.844\nGood practice to use domain name\n\\ user name whenever you're asked\n\n115\n00:07:23.844 --> 00:07:25.230\nto authenticate.\n\n116\n00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:28.190\nEven though it does list the domain\ndown below, I've found that\n\n117\n00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.620\nsometimes you do need to specify\nthe domain name in the user name field.\n\n118\n00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.773\nAnd also typing the correct\npassword is helpful.\n\n119\n00:07:34.773 --> 00:07:36.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> See what happens when I talk and\n\n120\n00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.595\nI type at the same time.\n\n121\n00:07:37.595 --> 00:07:38.940\n>> Right?\n>> Mistakes can happen.\n\n122\n00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.265\nGood thing I'm not chewing gum or\nwalking at the same time.\n\n123\n00:07:42.265 --> 00:07:44.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That would be overwhelming.\n\n124\n00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.880\nOkay, so here's my Central Admin site.\n\n125\n00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.347\nAnd I wanna go into Application\nManagement, Manage Service Applications.\n\n126\n00:07:54.394 --> 00:08:00.196\nAnd I'm gonna create a new\nSearch service application.\n\n127\n00:08:02.946 --> 00:08:03.850\nWorking it.\n\n128\n00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.859\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna call this one,\n\n129\n00:08:07.859 --> 00:08:12.408\nI'm not gonna use the default suggested\nname there, I'm gonna use Acme Search.\n\n130\n00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:17.243\nSearching for coyotes.\n\n131\n00:08:17.243 --> 00:08:19.518\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And anvils.\n\n132\n00:08:19.518 --> 00:08:22.201\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Meep-meep.\n\n133\n00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:29.799\nAll right, and now I'll choose one of\nthe service accounts set up earlier.\n\n134\n00:08:29.799 --> 00:08:32.705\nThe Acme SP search account, scroll down.\n\n135\n00:08:32.705 --> 00:08:35.981\nThis is frankly, an annoying interface\nbecause you can't expand it.\n\n136\n00:08:35.981 --> 00:08:39.700\nI like to be able to maximize\nscreen size on my dialog box.\n\n137\n00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.503\nI know, a minor complaint but still.\n\n138\n00:08:42.503 --> 00:08:47.055\nBecause many dialog boxes that you get in\nSharePoint do allow you to go full screen.\n\n139\n00:08:47.055 --> 00:08:49.330\n>> Right, consistency is all we ask for.\n\n140\n00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.386\n>> Is that asking too much?\n\n141\n00:08:50.386 --> 00:08:51.096\n>> I don't think so.\n\n142\n00:08:51.096 --> 00:08:51.687\n>> I think it is.\n\n143\n00:08:51.687 --> 00:08:54.694\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Version next.\n\n144\n00:08:54.694 --> 00:08:55.400\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n145\n00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.496\n>> All right, so I'll create a new\napplication pool, and I wanna set\n\n146\n00:09:00.496 --> 00:09:06.870\nup an account or choose a security account\nfor that and this will be spsearchadmin.\n\n147\n00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:12.390\nScroll down again and I'm gonna\ngive it an application pool name.\n\n148\n00:09:15.114 --> 00:09:21.542\nEverybody into the pool,\nthis will be SharePoint,\n\n149\n00:09:21.542 --> 00:09:26.959\nget these fingers working, SearchAdmin.\n\n150\n00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:32.810\nNo, SharePointSearchQuery, rather.\n\n151\n00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:37.185\nAnd as you'd expect,\nI'm using the searchquery account,\n\n152\n00:09:37.185 --> 00:09:39.920\nhit OK and see what happens.\n\n153\n00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.360\nHey, created successfully.\n\n154\n00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.460\nWas there any doubt?\n\n155\n00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.288\n>> Never.\n\n156\n00:09:43.288 --> 00:09:45.266\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n157\n00:09:49.838 --> 00:09:55.079\nNow I'm gonna go into my\nAcme Search Service application,\n\n158\n00:10:10.927 --> 00:10:13.640\nYou can see there, various databases.\n\n159\n00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:18.570\nRemember, databases get created every time\nwe create a service app, at least one,\n\n160\n00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.108\nsometimes more than one.\n\n161\n00:10:20.108 --> 00:10:23.359\nI'm gonna go into my default\ncontent access account now.\n\n162\n00:10:23.359 --> 00:10:27.645\nI'm gonna click on my Acmespsearch.\n\n163\n00:10:27.645 --> 00:10:30.810\nA little warning about\nthe page not being encrypted.\n\n164\n00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:40.039\nSo I'm gonna change the account\nhere to ACMEspcontentaccess.\n\n165\n00:10:42.861 --> 00:10:43.776\nThen enter the password.\n\n166\n00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:53.731\nAnd OK.\n\n167\n00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:59.503\nAnd we can see a little green\nloading bar there, loading, loading.\n\n168\n00:10:59.503 --> 00:11:06.205\nOkay, and now go back to Central Admin.\n\n169\n00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.203\nClick on my Acme Search.\n\n170\n00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:32.910\nAnd there's my Acmespcontentaccess account\nthere, next to Default Content Access.\n\n171\n00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.313\nNow content sources,\nwhat are we gonna crawl?\n\n172\n00:11:36.313 --> 00:11:40.335\nWhat do we wanna make indexed and\ntherefore searchable for our users?\n\n173\n00:11:40.335 --> 00:11:45.677\nWell, the default, it's prepopulated,\nis the SharePoint internal sites.\n\n174\n00:11:45.677 --> 00:11:46.814\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n175\n00:11:46.814 --> 00:11:51.539\n>> However, there's all kinds of other\ncontent sources we may wanna add like\n\n176\n00:11:51.539 --> 00:11:53.190\na file share for example.\n\n177\n00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.080\nSo I've chosen the IT File Share.\n\n178\n00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.090\nNotice we have to specify\nthe content source type.\n\n179\n00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.560\nIs it a website?\n\n180\n00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.800\nIs it an Exchange public folder?\n\n181\n00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.097\nIt could be a mine of business data or\na custom repository.\n\n182\n00:12:04.097 --> 00:12:09.830\nSo any organized data source,\nwe can index with SharePoint.\n\n183\n00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:10.800\nThat's part of the beauty of it.\n\n184\n00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.060\nSome people deploy SharePoint just\nto take advantage of the vast search\n\n185\n00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:14.920\ninfrastructure.\n\n186\n00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.350\nOne place for users to go,\n\n187\n00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:20.581\nas opposed to users having to go to\nmultiple locations to search for content.\n\n188\n00:12:20.581 --> 00:12:22.400\n>> Yeah,\nthat's a really fantastic feature.\n\n189\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.830\n>> Indeed, so now that I've\nspecified the File Share option,\n\n190\n00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.060\nthat radio button, then I have\nto specify the start address or\n\n191\n00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:35.160\nin this case, the UNC path to the content.\n\n192\n00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.042\nAnd then I can choose to crawl all\nthe content below the start address,\n\n193\n00:12:40.042 --> 00:12:42.961\nor only the folder of each start address.\n\n194\n00:12:42.961 --> 00:12:46.713\nSo if you don't wanna crawl microsoft.com,\nfor example.\n\n195\n00:12:46.713 --> 00:12:49.428\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Necessarily, but\n\n196\n00:12:49.428 --> 00:12:53.374\nyou may wanna crawl one\nsite on microsoft.com.\n\n197\n00:12:53.374 --> 00:12:54.408\n>> Right.\n\n198\n00:12:54.408 --> 00:12:58.453\n>> So how often do I, I don't wanna\nmanually invoke crawls every time,\n\n199\n00:12:58.453 --> 00:13:02.050\nI can choose daily,\nmonthly, or weekly crawls.\n\n200\n00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:06.398\nSo I'll choose a daily incremental,\nand then for full,\n\n201\n00:13:06.398 --> 00:13:09.126\nlet's say I do a weekly full crawl.\n\n202\n00:13:09.126 --> 00:13:10.401\nWhy not Saturday,\n\n203\n00:13:10.401 --> 00:13:15.190\nnot a lot going on in the work\nenvironment Saturday 2 AM, I would hope.\n\n204\n00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.294\nUnless people are working really late.\n\n205\n00:13:18.294 --> 00:13:19.391\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, and\n\n206\n00:13:19.391 --> 00:13:22.390\nthen there's a content source priority\noption there, Normal or High.\n\n207\n00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.290\nAnd as you'd expect,\n\n208\n00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:31.330\nhigh priority takes presidence in\nterms of the crawling behavior.\n\n209\n00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.800\nPrioritizing the work load.\n\n210\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:39.660\nI'm gonna switch back\nover to my SQL box now.\n\n211\n00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.560\nAnd I need to edit a group policy setting.\n\n212\n00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.840\nSo, one of the neat things\nin the era we live in now,\n\n213\n00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.710\nI can just hit the Start menu and\nstart typing, and the field will appear.\n\n214\n00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.540\nAnd then, I chose the option there that\nappeared below, Edit group policy.\n\n215\n00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.774\nNow this is an example of a MMC\nthat I can maximize, and again,\n\n216\n00:13:58.774 --> 00:14:00.329\nI like to go to the max.\n\n217\n00:14:00.329 --> 00:14:03.985\nSo I'm gonna do that and\nrearrange this little bar here so\n\n218\n00:14:03.985 --> 00:14:07.499\nyou can all see exactly where\nI'm navigating down to.\n\n219\n00:14:07.499 --> 00:14:10.290\nWhich will be under\nthe Computer Configuration settings,\n\n220\n00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.040\nremember this is local computer\npolicy on the SQL Server.\n\n221\n00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:18.350\nUnder Windows Settings >\nSecurity Settings > Local Policies.\n\n222\n00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.500\nDon't ask me why these options\naren't alphabetically arranged,\n\n223\n00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.261\nI don't design these.\n\n224\n00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:24.301\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> However, at least the policy section,\n\n225\n00:14:24.301 --> 00:14:26.670\nwhere there can be dozens of settings.\n\n226\n00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:29.750\nAt least you can order that column,\nand by default,\n\n227\n00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:33.435\nit is ordered alphabetically, so\nthat's a mini rant there from me.\n\n228\n00:14:33.435 --> 00:14:34.449\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n229\n00:14:34.449 --> 00:14:40.104\nI'm particularly interested in the Manage\nauditing and security log Properties,\n\n230\n00:14:40.104 --> 00:14:44.014\nI'm gonna add my spcontentaccess\naccount to that group.\n\n231\n00:14:44.014 --> 00:14:44.542\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n232\n00:14:47.873 --> 00:14:48.627\n>> Okay.\n\n233\n00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:57.970\nThat's good, and\nnow I wanna set up permissions\n\n234\n00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:04.030\non the file share,\nthe IT share I set up earlier.\n\n235\n00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:08.721\nProperties, go to the Security tab there.\n\n236\n00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:10.568\nClick on Edit.\n\n237\n00:15:22.354 --> 00:15:23.472\nOpen, I command you.\n\n238\n00:15:23.472 --> 00:15:27.644\nOkay, and I'll add, and you don't have\nto type the whole user account or\n\n239\n00:15:27.644 --> 00:15:31.490\ngroup account name here,\nyou can just type some of it.\n\n240\n00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.736\nAnd I hit OK, and notice how it filled in\nthe rest, the spcontentaccess account.\n\n241\n00:15:35.736 --> 00:15:39.317\nIf there was more than one option from\nthe number of characters I created,\n\n242\n00:15:39.317 --> 00:15:41.049\nI would get a choice between those,\n\n243\n00:15:41.049 --> 00:15:44.850\nbut I knew that SPC was enough to\nuniquely identify that account.\n\n244\n00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:46.423\nAll right, so\nthat's all I need to do there.\n\n245\n00:15:46.423 --> 00:15:51.674\nAnd now, you can see there,\nI've got content source, the default local\n\n246\n00:15:51.674 --> 00:15:57.450\nSharePoint sites, and the one I added\nwhich is the IT File Share content source.\n\n247\n00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:01.603\nAnd by clicking or\nhovering near that IT File Share, I can,\n\n248\n00:16:01.603 --> 00:16:05.607\nfrom the context menu,\nyou choose to start a Full Crawl.\n\n249\n00:16:05.607 --> 00:16:09.710\nI'll say OK, let's do this.\n\n250\n00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:15.431\nThis'll take a few minutes, Normally,\n\n251\n00:16:15.431 --> 00:16:20.010\nor hours depending on the [COUGH]\nsize of the content you're crawling.\n\n252\n00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:23.910\n[COUGH] This one took minutes.\n\n253\n00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:26.940\nIt doesn't refresh automatically.\n\n254\n00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.830\nSo, you keep hitting Refresh and\nthen eventually it'll get to idle.\n\n255\n00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.070\nThen, you know the content source\nhas been crawled successfully.\n\n256\n00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:37.490\nAnd there's some details about\nwhen the crawl last completed,\n\n257\n00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:43.890\nwhen the next full crawl is scheduled and\nthe next incremental crawl that's useful.\n\n258\n00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:50.398\nAnd we have a Crawl Log as well,\nfor each content source.\n\n259\n00:16:50.398 --> 00:16:55.920\nSo, it says we've got success.\n\n260\n00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.770\n>> Good.\n\n261\n00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:01.100\nWhich is a beautiful thing and\nthen I can filter by content source now,\n\n262\n00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.780\nif you just have one or two continents\nsources with only a small amount of data\n\n263\n00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:09.796\nto parse no biggie but this could come in\nhandy when it comes to troubleshooting\n\n264\n00:17:09.796 --> 00:17:18.242\na summary on the left there and various\ntabs you can do statistics by Server Name.\n\n265\n00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:21.880\nError breakdowns.\n\n266\n00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.690\nOften you want to know why a crawl\nwas not able to be completed.\n\n267\n00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:26.990\nUsually it's a permissions issue.\n\n268\n00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.730\nIn other words, the crawler count\ndoes not have permissions to\n\n269\n00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.570\nthe content source it's trying to crawl.\n\n270\n00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:34.730\nSo, I can filter my errors.\n\n271\n00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.300\nThere's a little databases tab there,\nas well.\n\n272\n00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.820\nI wanna know my crawl database name,\nthere it is.\n\n273\n00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.420\nAnd I can search for\ndocuments that have been crawled\n\n274\n00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.660\nusing wildcard characters if you want,\nor a full URL path.\n\n275\n00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.360\nRemember, search is\na week-long conversation.\n\n276\n00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.240\nWe don't have a full week for\nsearch, so I'm deliberately not\n\n277\n00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.540\ndiving into detail on everything but\nshowing you most of what is here.\n\n278\n00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:06.740\nOkay, so\nI will check out the crawl history,\n\n279\n00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:10.620\nthere's another option there if I wanted.\n\n280\n00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.250\nLet's see what do I wanna do now?\n\n281\n00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:19.380\nGo back to contact sources and my local\nSharePoint sites, let's crawl them.\n\n282\n00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.810\nAre you sure?\n\n283\n00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:21.864\nSure, I'm sure.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n284\n00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.130\n>> Get on with it.\n\n285\n00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.330\nOkay, and\nI can see the status is starting there.\n\n286\n00:18:33.834 --> 00:18:36.787\nNow, if I click on the Content Source,\n\n287\n00:18:36.787 --> 00:18:42.080\nI can get more detail on when the last\nCrawl completed, when it began.\n\n288\n00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.430\nAnd again, whether you want to crawl\neverything under the URL host name, or\n\n289\n00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.470\njust the site selection referenced\nat the starting address.\n\n290\n00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:54.450\nThis is kind of the,\nyou can enable continuous crawls as well.\n\n291\n00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:57.990\nSo, rather than doing incremental\ncrawls every x number of hours,\n\n292\n00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.290\nyou can crawl continuously.\n\n293\n00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:03.750\nAnd the crawling behavior's smart\nenough not to overwhelm the resources,\n\n294\n00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:04.850\nwhich is crawling, right?\n\n295\n00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:08.940\nAnd I'll show you a little later\nhow you can change the impact,\n\n296\n00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.750\nin other words the speed of crawling.\n\n297\n00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:16.870\nLet's say Sunday, 2AM here for\nfull Crawl for our internal sites.\n\n298\n00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.990\nNow, depending on the organization,\n\n299\n00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:23.590\nusers may be demanding,\nthat search results are up to date.\n\n300\n00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.410\nIn other words, they don't wanna wait\n24 hours til the next full crawl,\n\n301\n00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.420\nso if that's important,\nthen also we've got crawl and\n\n302\n00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.150\ncontinuous there now for the status.\n\n303\n00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.150\nIf that's important, then you're gonna\nhave to set up an infrastructure and\n\n304\n00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:38.090\nmake sure you've tested out that\nyou can crawl either continuously.\n\n305\n00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.650\nDo multiple incremental crawls to\nmake sure that users are getting\n\n306\n00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.580\nfresh content or\nfresh results from their queries.\n\n307\n00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.710\nAnd you can guarantee that some\nof them will be testing out this.\n\n308\n00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:50.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Continuous crawl,\n\n309\n00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.020\na little knowledge is a dangerous thing,\nright?\n\n310\n00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.340\n>> Yes.\n>> I have done some readings, I said okay,\n\n311\n00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.200\nI should be able to get the searches out.\n\n312\n00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.500\nBased on this document I just\ncreated three minutes ago.\n\n313\n00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.550\nWhy can I not search for\n\n314\n00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:05.060\nmy fabulous document with\nthese special keywords in it?\n\n315\n00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.430\nAnd then they call Help Desk, so.\n\n316\n00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.990\n>> Probably, yeah, you can't please\nall the people all the time.\n\n317\n00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.990\nSo, I'll start a full crawl there\non my local SharePoint sites.\n\n318\n00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.770\nNow, you always want to have a combination\nof full and either incremental or\n\n319\n00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.160\ncontinuous crawling right?\n\n320\n00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.020\nBecause you might think continuous\ncrawling would capture everything,\n\n321\n00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.970\nindex all property fields but\nno that's not the case.\n\n322\n00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.730\nOther words theres other fields or\nMedidata related to documents for\n\n323\n00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:39.570\nexample or other file types that our\nonly captured during a full Crawl.\n\n324\n00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:44.000\nSo, you always need a combination of full\nand incremental or continuous crawling.\n\n325\n00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:51.155\nOkay, I'll go into my managed Web Apps\nhere, and the Central Admin v4 and\n\n326\n00:20:51.155 --> 00:20:55.540\nSharePoint 80, Web Apps are default.\n\n327\n00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.860\nThen I created a three for this course.\n\n328\n00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.740\nI'm going to go into managed paths now.\n\n329\n00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.910\nSo, you can see there these are defaults.\n\n330\n00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:09.830\nFor example, sites, so when I create a new\nsite collection, I can choose to create\n\n331\n00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:17.090\nthe URL for the unique URL\ninformation after the slash sites.\n\n332\n00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:19.430\nBut I want to create a new path, so\n\n333\n00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:22.810\nnow when I create a new site collection,\nyou can see there's search in the path.\n\n334\n00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:30.450\nI'll have an option to create a site\ncollection under slash search.\n\n335\n00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:34.510\nSo, you create any number of manage\npaths if you want which are useful for\n\n336\n00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.470\nadministration.\n\n337\n00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.670\nBackups and other reasons just general\ninformation on architecture and\n\n338\n00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:41.990\norganization.\n\n339\n00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:47.660\nSo, you don't have to that's an error,\ncuz I'm using IE on a server here.\n\n340\n00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:48.990\nSo, [COUGH] not to worry.\n\n341\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.550\nSo now, I can see Web Application.\n\n342\n00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:53.940\nI've got my SharePoint AD.\n\n343\n00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.260\nI'll just use that Web app.\n\n344\n00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:59.180\nRemember, you can choose the Web app\nby clicking on the listed Web app\n\n345\n00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.270\nwhenever there is a an option\nto create something or\n\n346\n00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:06.180\ndo some activity that pertains\nto a specific Web app only.\n\n347\n00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:10.100\nSo, I'm gonna create a site\ncollection here in my SPO1 path\n\n348\n00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:14.370\nwe're gonna call it search center you\ndon't have to give a description but\n\n349\n00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.220\nwhat the heck it can't hurt\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n350\n00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:21.820\n>> So,\nI'll say search results from all of ACME.\n\n351\n00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:26.200\nNow, I'll scroll down a bit\nto make this easier to see.\n\n352\n00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.430\nSo, you can see the URL path there, that\nwe can have our root site collection right\n\n353\n00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:34.950\nunder SPO1/ and then the URL but\nhere's the managed path I just set up.\n\n354\n00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:37.614\nSo, it'll be SPO1/search.\n\n355\n00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.910\nWe have a variety of templates which\nwe talked about in other episodes.\n\n356\n00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.248\nAnd so\nwithout going over all of them again,\n\n357\n00:22:47.248 --> 00:22:49.620\nill just click on\nEnterprise Search Center.\n\n358\n00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:54.318\nSo, remember template is some\nunique combination of themes and\n\n359\n00:22:54.318 --> 00:22:57.140\nWeb parts and functionality.\n\n360\n00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:58.740\nSo that you don't have\nto reinvent the wheel\n\n361\n00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.840\nwhen it comes time to creating\nnew sites or site collection.\n\n362\n00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.845\nSo, I can use my SPAdmin account.\n\n363\n00:23:04.845 --> 00:23:09.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Spam, no SPAdmin.\n\n364\n00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:13.270\nAnd then, I could optionally specify\na secondary site collection administrator,\n\n365\n00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.655\nand a quota template if I want but I'm\nnot into quotas today, so I won't bother.\n\n366\n00:23:19.655 --> 00:23:23.340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don't limit me, I'm the admin.\n\n367\n00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.030\nThis circle is going around of the tab\nif you're wondering what's happening.\n\n368\n00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:31.919\nIt's taking its time,\n\n369\n00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:38.450\nworking on it, work it, okay.\n\n370\n00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:43.238\nAnd now, I'm gonna click on my search\nsite that just got created and\n\n371\n00:23:43.238 --> 00:23:45.340\nI need to authenticate here.\n\n372\n00:23:52.493 --> 00:23:56.956\nRemember shorter URLs are more desirable,\nand internally by the way you can\n\n373\n00:23:56.956 --> 00:24:00.094\nget away with as long you\nset your DNS appropriately,\n\n374\n00:24:00.094 --> 00:24:04.908\nyou can get away with typing, for\nexample HTTP://intranet Which seems like,\n\n375\n00:24:04.908 --> 00:24:07.932\nwait a minute,\nthere's something missing here.\n\n376\n00:24:07.932 --> 00:24:11.036\nBut no, again with DNS if you\nset it up with host headers,\n\n377\n00:24:11.036 --> 00:24:13.538\nthat's enough to get\nto your internet site.\n\n378\n00:24:13.538 --> 00:24:16.780\n>> Yeah, or use global name zones,\nsingle label names,\n\n379\n00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.900\nI suppose you could set that up.\n\n380\n00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.050\n>> Indeed.\n\n381\n00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:23.870\nSo here's my very clean Search interface,\nless is more.\n\n382\n00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:24.440\nThank you, Google.\n\n383\n00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:29.730\nSo I can always customize this page,\nor get a dev to do it.\n\n384\n00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.916\nAnd let's see what happens\nwhen I search for a word.\n\n385\n00:24:38.095 --> 00:24:39.590\n>> Drumroll, please.\n\n386\n00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:40.870\nIt's searching.\n\n387\n00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:42.150\n>> It's searching.\n\n388\n00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.435\n>> And finding nothing.\n\n389\n00:24:43.435 --> 00:24:43.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nothing.\n\n390\n00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:48.920\nThis is annoying, when sometimes it\nlooks like from the content sources that\n\n391\n00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.280\nthe crawl completed successfully,\nbut in fact, it hasn't yet.\n\n392\n00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.820\nSo I'm just mainly pointing\nout the tabs here available to\n\n393\n00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:58.690\ndefault on the Search Center\nsite template.\n\n394\n00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:00.320\nSo you can filter by\n\n395\n00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:05.970\npeople if you wanna refine your search\nby conversations, even videos now.\n\n396\n00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:09.600\nSo Microsoft's, you can see in\nthe SharePoint online interface now,\n\n397\n00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.640\nmore support for\nvideo content because that is so popular.\n\n398\n00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:17.350\nOn the left it says,\nwe don't have any refiners to show you.\n\n399\n00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:18.385\nThat has nothing to do with sugar.\n\n400\n00:25:18.385 --> 00:25:21.855\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a way of if you end up with, say\n\n401\n00:25:21.855 --> 00:25:26.840\n100,000 search results, or 10,000, it's a\nway of further filtering the results that\n\n402\n00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.530\nare displayed based on date, for\nexample, or author, or some field.\n\n403\n00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:37.829\nBut for now I'll go back to\nApplication Manglement, here.\n\n404\n00:25:40.915 --> 00:25:41.530\nWhat am I gonna do?\n\n405\n00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:46.800\nOkay, back to Manage Content Sources,\nmy IT file share.\n\n406\n00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:54.270\nAgain, don't be surprised if it looks like\nthe search or the indexing is completed,\n\n407\n00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:57.650\ncrawling, and yet you don't actually\nget the results right away.\n\n408\n00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:58.530\nThere can be a lag there.\n\n409\n00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.850\nLike a lot of things SharePoint related,\nfrankly, there can be a lag,\n\n410\n00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:01.690\nwhether it's online,\n\n411\n00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.940\nyou're provisioning a service, setting\nup your app catalog for the first time.\n\n412\n00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.120\nSo I can go into Crawls, there.\n\n413\n00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.690\nAnd they're hyperlink numbers, so\n\n414\n00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.660\nthe number of URLs that\nwere successfully crawled.\n\n415\n00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.450\nThere's been a couple.\n\n416\n00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.160\nThis is kind of neat.\n\n417\n00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.780\nI can reveal what's in the content\nsource that I just crawled\n\n418\n00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.800\nby selecting that option there.\n\n419\n00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.500\nIt opens a new tab.\n\n420\n00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.110\nAnd this is the lingo.\n\n421\n00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:28.151\nThat's why I was expecting to find the\nwork paragraph in my search result, but\n\n422\n00:26:28.151 --> 00:26:32.420\nmaybe I was a little to hasty, and\nI'll have to come back later to try that.\n\n423\n00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.170\nWhat else do we have here?\n\n424\n00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:36.833\nWe have Crawl Health Reports, and\n\n425\n00:26:36.833 --> 00:26:42.657\nways of filtering by content source,\nby a date range.\n\n426\n00:26:42.657 --> 00:26:47.398\nSo we can see Total Items there\non the right-hand side, 17 items,\n\n427\n00:26:47.398 --> 00:26:48.934\n7 were modified.\n\n428\n00:26:48.934 --> 00:26:50.930\nYeah, my head was cutting that off.\n\n429\n00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:54.300\nSix errors in there, and\nthen a nice colored graph.\n\n430\n00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.532\nOf course, there's not a lot\nof content there to graph, so\n\n431\n00:26:56.532 --> 00:27:00.100\nit's not the most scintillating thing.\n\n432\n00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.200\nQuery Latency.\n\n433\n00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:08.060\nSo how much time between the query and\nthe results return?\n\n434\n00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.260\nTypically, one second,\n\n435\n00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:13.440\nour attention span is rather short and\nunfortunately declining.\n\n436\n00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:18.160\nIf you have one or two seconds max, if you\njust aren't getting some kind of response,\n\n437\n00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.630\neither some kind of spinning wheel, or\n\n438\n00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.780\nthe results they're wanting,\nthey're gonna get antsy.\n\n439\n00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.210\n>> They're gonna click\nit a hundred more times.\n\n440\n00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.065\n>> That's right [LAUGH].\n\n441\n00:27:25.065 --> 00:27:26.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That won't impact our server at all.\n\n442\n00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.060\n>> No [LAUGH].\n\n443\n00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:32.690\n>> Right, or they'll just\ngenerally experience odd behavior.\n\n444\n00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.969\nMultiple clicking, calling help desk,\ncomplaining about things,\n\n445\n00:27:35.969 --> 00:27:37.921\nhating SharePoint, whatever it takes.\n\n446\n00:27:37.921 --> 00:27:42.698\nSo that's why we wanna know\nabout query latency cuz maybe we\n\n447\n00:27:42.698 --> 00:27:46.623\ncan throw more resources\nto reduce the latency.\n\n448\n00:27:46.623 --> 00:27:49.780\nOf course, it's affected by the number\nof people querying at a given time.\n\n449\n00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.990\nSo this usage reports, ooh.\n\n450\n00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:58.250\nOkay, so if there is no usage to report,\nyou do get an error.\n\n451\n00:27:58.250 --> 00:27:59.290\nSo I won't open these other ones.\n\n452\n00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:02.400\nBut you can see there are Excel\nspreadsheets, conveniently formatted,\n\n453\n00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.440\nvery simple.\n\n454\n00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:10.810\nSo you can get reports on queries and\nother kinds of activities.\n\n455\n00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:12.680\nCrawl Rules, this is cool.\n\n456\n00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.710\nSo for a given URL path, let's say a\ndocument library, I can type in the URL to\n\n457\n00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:20.890\nthat document library and\nsee if it matches the crawl rule.\n\n458\n00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:22.230\nSo why would I do this?\n\n459\n00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.457\nWell, maybe someone's expecting to\nsearch for and find information and\n\n460\n00:28:25.457 --> 00:28:26.740\nthey can't find it.\n\n461\n00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:31.838\nSo maybe we've excluded a document\nlibrary from search, for example.\n\n462\n00:28:31.838 --> 00:28:34.110\nOr maybe it's subject to\nconflicting rules and\n\n463\n00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.670\nthe first rule that applied\nwas the effective one.\n\n464\n00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:42.110\nAnother thing we can do is we can add\na file type to search or not search.\n\n465\n00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:46.390\nSo maybe there's certain content,\nmaybe it's some old file type.\n\n466\n00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:52.190\nNow, we don't even have an application\nto open the old file type,\n\n467\n00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:53.520\nbut we don't need to index it, either.\n\n468\n00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.070\nWe're just keeping it around for\n\n469\n00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:59.580\nsome reason, so I can choose to\nnot index files of that extension.\n\n470\n00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:05.900\nNow, sometimes if the index gets\ncorrupted, there's no way to repair it,\n\n471\n00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.850\nthe best way is to start fresh.\n\n472\n00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:13.150\nIf you do that, and you start indexing,\nand then if people have subscribed to\n\n473\n00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.700\nalerts, they're gonna get all kinds\nof alerts thinking that, there's new\n\n474\n00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.710\ninformation, this document library,\nfor example, when really, it's not.\n\n475\n00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:22.060\nSo we can deactivate search\nresults during the reindexing.\n\n476\n00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.175\nJust remember though to\ncheck that box again after.\n\n477\n00:29:25.175 --> 00:29:27.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n478\n00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:30.020\nthat people's alerts\nwill get sent to them.\n\n479\n00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.220\nHere's what I was talking about earlier,\nCrawler Impact Rules.\n\n480\n00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:38.700\nSo let's say maybe we're\ngetting some feedback that\n\n481\n00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:43.790\nour crawler activity is negatively\nimpacting a content source.\n\n482\n00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:44.960\nMaybe we're a bit too aggressive.\n\n483\n00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:49.050\nThe default is for\neight documents at a time to be requested.\n\n484\n00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:52.170\nI can really slow that down by saying,\nonly request one at a time, and\n\n485\n00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:55.030\nwait x number of seconds between requests.\n\n486\n00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:58.780\nSo this will have two effects which\nI'm sure you can think of right away.\n\n487\n00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.030\nOne is, it's gonna take a lot\nlonger to index the content.\n\n488\n00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:06.620\nBut, two, we'll have a lot less noticeable\nimpact on that content we're searching.\n\n489\n00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:07.450\nSo you can tweak that.\n\n490\n00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.670\nYou might wanna increase it\nto 16 documents at a time.\n\n491\n00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:14.700\nJust experiment and measure the results\nand see if you get any feedback.\n\n492\n00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.160\nAuthoritative pages.\n\n493\n00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.850\nThis is useful because, and\nagain, a manual process.\n\n494\n00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:23.070\nThis doesn't happen automagically.\n\n495\n00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:24.620\nSomeone has to go in there and say, okay,\n\n496\n00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:29.900\nwe've gotta a renowned expert on\nstatistics in our organization.\n\n497\n00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:33.790\nSo anything that that statistician\nwrites or blogs about, or\n\n498\n00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:37.410\nany documents he or she's involved in,\nwe want to make authoritative.\n\n499\n00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:40.780\nIn other words,\nwe're going to increase the ranking,\n\n500\n00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.670\nthe secret sauce ranking, so\nthat when people are querying,\n\n501\n00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:49.405\nand it has something to do with\na document that the statistician created,\n\n502\n00:30:49.405 --> 00:30:52.550\nthat result is gonna appear\nhigher up in the search results.\n\n503\n00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.374\nFor less impact, we could use second or\nthird level authoritative pages.\n\n504\n00:30:56.374 --> 00:31:00.070\nWe could also demote, say,\nnon-authoritative pages.\n\n505\n00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:05.120\nIf we've got some wingnut that's\nhanging around and is losing it, demote\n\n506\n00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.730\ntheir content from the search results\n>> Why is Mike writing about statistics he\n\n507\n00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:10.335\nknows nothing about it.\n\n508\n00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:11.580\n>> [LAUGH] He's losing it.\n\n509\n00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.190\nHe went to see A Beautiful Mind and\nhe thinks he knows.\n\n510\n00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:17.840\nOkay, that was a good movie, actually.\n\n511\n00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:22.765\nOkay, so now we have result\nsources we can manage, and\n\n512\n00:31:22.765 --> 00:31:25.559\nwe can add a new Result Source.\n\n513\n00:31:28.854 --> 00:31:29.853\nAnd we can type it in there.\n\n514\n00:31:29.853 --> 00:31:36.811\nSo we can connect into other sources\nwith the OpenSearch 1.1 or 1.0 protocol.\n\n515\n00:31:36.811 --> 00:31:40.420\nThis lets us play nicely with others,\nso we can extract information,\n\n516\n00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:44.790\nhave it indexable, and\nbring it into our SharePoint environment.\n\n517\n00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:47.860\nSo Microsoft's much more user-friendly\nnow in terms of participating in some of\n\n518\n00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:51.270\nthese open standards, with the new regime,\nwith Satya in charge.\n\n519\n00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:54.510\nThings like Azure hosting,\nI think 25% of the workloads, or\n\n520\n00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:56.890\nthe VMs, in Azure are Linux boxes,\nfor example.\n\n521\n00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.646\n>> Wow.\n>> That would never happen in the Ballmer\n\n522\n00:31:58.646 --> 00:31:59.960\nera, for sure.\n\n523\n00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.054\nOkay, we can also transform queries there.\n\n524\n00:32:02.054 --> 00:32:07.820\nSo if a user searches on, let's say,\nan old product name we can Translate\n\n525\n00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:13.410\nthat query to include results from\nthe new product name, for example.\n\n526\n00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:18.010\nNow, so again if you've done\nany search engine optimization,\n\n527\n00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.370\nthis won't be a surprise to you or\nit won't throw you very much.\n\n528\n00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:24.780\nSo we can promote important results,\n\n529\n00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:29.510\nwe can tune the ranking here with query\nrules, we can even display a certain\n\n530\n00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:33.440\nsection of query results in a box or\npromoted results.\n\n531\n00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.330\nIf you think of Google, for example,\n\n532\n00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:37.400\nthere's paid results that\nappear at the top of the list.\n\n533\n00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.190\nIf you're using various apps,\nlike Hotwire, to look for a hotel,\n\n534\n00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:42.030\nthere would be a sponsored\nresult at the top.\n\n535\n00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:45.610\nOr you can do this kind\nof promotion of one or\n\n536\n00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:52.180\nmore search results based on any criteria\nyou specify from this slide here.\n\n537\n00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:55.200\nAnd it's an iterative process,\nyou're gonna get feedback from your users.\n\n538\n00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.750\nYou're gonna experiment\nwith the system and\n\n539\n00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:59.370\nrealize, this search isn't\nworking the way I want it.\n\n540\n00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:02.590\nI could make it better,\nI could demote certain results,\n\n541\n00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:06.920\nmaybe we're gonna not index certain\ncontent that's just not useful anymore.\n\n542\n00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.080\nWe have to keep it for archive purposes,\n\n543\n00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.020\nbut it's just cluttering\nup the search results.\n\n544\n00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:16.134\nTuning Search is an on-going process,\nit's not a one and done,\n\n545\n00:33:16.134 --> 00:33:19.095\nit's certainly not let's just install\nSharePoint and we're good to go.\n\n546\n00:33:19.095 --> 00:33:21.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Of all the products Microsoft has\n\n547\n00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.250\nSharePoint, I would say,\n\n548\n00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:26.040\nis the most hands- on in terms of what you\nneed to do to set it up for your needs.\n\n549\n00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.721\nAnd there's so much it can do, as well, so\n\n550\n00:33:30.721 --> 00:33:34.500\nyou're gonna need to plan first.\n\n551\n00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.820\nIt's gonna take awhile to execute.\n\n552\n00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:42.310\nOkay, so let's say I can create a rule\nhere based on source documents with\n\n553\n00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:48.020\nthe word, doctor,\nactually abbreviations of Dr.\n\n554\n00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.450\nWe can also use an alternate condition.\n\n555\n00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:54.240\nSo maybe a word like doctor spelled out,\nfor example.\n\n556\n00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:59.851\nSo in other words, if Dr.\nor doctor appears in the search query,\n\n557\n00:33:59.851 --> 00:34:03.944\nthen we're gonna say,\nadd a promoted result.\n\n558\n00:34:03.944 --> 00:34:06.029\nMaybe some of you use WebMD, I don't know.\n\n559\n00:34:06.029 --> 00:34:06.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's\n\n560\n00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:11.530\none of the authoritative web sources for\nI've got a hang nail, what should I do?\n\n561\n00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:12.445\nI think I broke my leg.\n\n562\n00:34:12.445 --> 00:34:15.536\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you can get curated and\n\n563\n00:34:15.536 --> 00:34:22.032\nactual doctor commentary, not just\npeople's theories about vaccination.\n\n564\n00:34:22.032 --> 00:34:24.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Okay, I won't go there.\n\n565\n00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.180\nI just went there,\nmaybe we can edit that out.\n\n566\n00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:30.960\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, we have fun here.\n\n567\n00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.360\nAnd more complexity here for\nbuilding a query.\n\n568\n00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:38.240\nAnd notice there's some keyword\nfilters there, property filters.\n\n569\n00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.270\nSo that is way beyond\nthe scope of this course.\n\n570\n00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.061\nBut again,\n\n571\n00:34:42.061 --> 00:34:47.056\nthere's many days of training you could\ndo just on tuning search results.\n\n572\n00:34:47.056 --> 00:34:50.910\nAnd then for this query rule, maybe we\nonly wanna run it for a one month trial,\n\n573\n00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:52.882\nfor example, so we can schedule this.\n\n574\n00:34:52.882 --> 00:34:54.736\nAnd what I love is that there's\nan end date as well, so\n\n575\n00:34:54.736 --> 00:34:56.880\nwe don't have to remember\nto turn anything off.\n\n576\n00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.210\nWe can do a one month trial, for\n\n577\n00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:01.270\nexample, and\nmaybe we're gonna get feedback from users.\n\n578\n00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:04.320\nDid you enjoy, did you notice anything\ndifferent about search results for\n\n579\n00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.815\nthe month of July, for example?\n\n580\n00:35:06.815 --> 00:35:10.700\nSo you always want to be getting feedback,\nnot just complains to help desk,\n\n581\n00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:16.400\nmaybe get a random sample of users and ask\nthem what they think of the search index.\n\n582\n00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.765\nSo now I'm looking at\nvarious properties here.\n\n583\n00:35:19.765 --> 00:35:25.850\nSo we don't have to index and search all\nof the metadata, or various properties,\n\n584\n00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:29.940\nwe can pick and choose which one's\nthat no one is likely to search on or\n\n585\n00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:34.750\nfilter by, therefore, maybe we don't need\nto index all of this obscure metadata.\n\n586\n00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:38.580\nLet's start with the defaults and then\ntweak as needed because everything that's\n\n587\n00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:43.190\nindexed does take up space in one or more\ndatabases, so keep that in mind as well.\n\n588\n00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.287\nNow, we have query suggestions as well.\n\n589\n00:35:45.287 --> 00:35:48.415\nAnd if you've ever typed in a search\nengine these days, Bing, Google,\n\n590\n00:35:48.415 --> 00:35:51.101\nyou start typing it's like,\nwow, are they reading my mind?\n\n591\n00:35:51.101 --> 00:35:53.221\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because it fills out the rest of\n\n592\n00:35:53.221 --> 00:35:55.940\na potential query for\nyou into some drop-down options.\n\n593\n00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:00.528\nWell, that's what these suggestion\nphrases are, suggested phrases.\n\n594\n00:36:00.528 --> 00:36:03.710\nAnd then we can populate\nthose suggested phrases\n\n595\n00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:06.199\nfrom the Term Store Management Tool.\n\n596\n00:36:06.199 --> 00:36:10.292\nSo this interface should look\nfamiliar from another episode.\n\n597\n00:36:10.292 --> 00:36:14.442\nYou can specify inclusions or\nexclusions, as well.\n\n598\n00:36:14.442 --> 00:36:17.927\nSo anytime we can make search\nresults easier for you,\n\n599\n00:36:17.927 --> 00:36:21.645\nyou don't have to type in\nthe entire multi-word query,\n\n600\n00:36:21.645 --> 00:36:26.340\nkind of like auto complete, they select,\nand that makes life easier.\n\n601\n00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:29.330\nNow, this is a very important screen here,\nURLs to remove.\n\n602\n00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:33.610\nSo sometimes with uncertainty\nabout permissions,\n\n603\n00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:35.345\nmaybe somebody broke inheritance,\n\n604\n00:36:35.345 --> 00:36:39.280\ncreated some custom permissions for a\nparticular document library, for example.\n\n605\n00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:43.840\nFor whatever reason, there may be content\nthat should be privately viewable that\n\n606\n00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:48.910\nsomehow, say, the rank and file were\nable to view, like layoffs or something.\n\n607\n00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:52.570\nSo you might get a panic call saying,\nwhy is this document in search results?\n\n608\n00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:53.330\nRemove it immediately.\n\n609\n00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:56.460\nSo then you can come to this page and\ntype in the URL, say,\n\n610\n00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:01.150\nof that document library, and\nimmediately remove it from search results.\n\n611\n00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:05.840\nSo from that point on, anyone searching\nfor content that previously returned that\n\n612\n00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:09.525\nconfidential information that\nwasn't supposed to be exposed,\n\n613\n00:37:09.525 --> 00:37:11.200\nthey won't get that result.\n\n614\n00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.559\nThen you have time, after you've done that\npart, you have time then to figure out\n\n615\n00:37:15.559 --> 00:37:20.359\nthe permissions issue, or why that content\nappeared for everyone, say, when it's only\n\n616\n00:37:20.359 --> 00:37:24.359\nsupposed to be revealed, or permissions\nare only supposed be for our VPs.\n\n617\n00:37:24.359 --> 00:37:27.798\nSo this is important link to remember.\n\n618\n00:37:27.798 --> 00:37:28.869\n>> Very good.\n\n619\n00:37:28.869 --> 00:37:32.916\nAll right Mark, again, you had a great\nlook there at the Enterprise search\n\n620\n00:37:32.916 --> 00:37:36.690\ncapabilities of SharePoint\n2016 on-premise.\n\n621\n00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:38.430\nSo we thank you for that,\ngreat demonstration.\n\n622\n00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:40.530\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n623\n00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:43.650\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n624\n00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:44.276\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n625\n00:37:44.276 --> 00:37:46.554\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n626\n00:37:46.554 --> 00:37:52.057\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.823\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:19.823 --> 00:00:23.889\nAnd specifically, in this episode, we'll\nbe looking at monitoring our SharePoint\n\n5\n00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:28.270\ndeployment, as well as, a little bit\nof maintaining and troubleshooting.\n\n6\n00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.780\nThe more complex these services get,\nand SharePoint being,\n\n7\n00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.930\nit's got a lot moving parts to it.\n\n8\n00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.500\nSo it's very important that we understand\none, how to monitor it, what to monitor,\n\n9\n00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.810\nwhere to look.\n\n10\n00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.242\nAnd then what to do if we find something\nthat maybe doesn't look quite right.\n\n11\n00:00:44.242 --> 00:00:47.370\nSo it's a big part of keeping\nthat environment up and\n\n12\n00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.651\nrunning at that peak performance\nthat we really need.\n\n13\n00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:52.616\nWe know SharePoint can get a little slow,\n\n14\n00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:56.615\nespecially if we're not making sure that\neverything's running the way it should.\n\n15\n00:00:56.615 --> 00:00:58.935\nSo here to help us with that is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n16\n00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:00.015\nHow's it going, Mark?\n\n17\n00:01:00.015 --> 00:01:00.976\n>> Good, thanks, Mike.\n\n18\n00:01:00.976 --> 00:01:02.262\nThere's no oil and filter requirement.\n\n19\n00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:03.832\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'd love to change that.\n\n20\n00:01:03.832 --> 00:01:07.733\nBut there are things you need to look at,\nand we're gonna dive right in, right now.\n\n21\n00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.253\nBack to our central admins site,\n\n22\n00:01:10.253 --> 00:01:15.303\nwhich will become your home away\nfrom home, I guess you could say.\n\n23\n00:01:15.303 --> 00:01:18.760\nSo, let's click on the monitoring link.\n\n24\n00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.782\nAnd I want to configure\ndiagnostic logging.\n\n25\n00:01:24.782 --> 00:01:29.525\nSo, there variety of categories in\nlogging, and a good caveat, don't log what\n\n26\n00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:34.370\nyou're not gonna look at, or\nthere's no legal requirement to capture.\n\n27\n00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.394\nDon't think I'm gonna log,\nall categories, in a verbose mode.\n\n28\n00:01:39.394 --> 00:01:40.499\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In other words,\n\n29\n00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:41.650\nexactly what I'm doing here.\n\n30\n00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.190\n>> Not unless you get a few\nextra terabytes of storage,\n\n31\n00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.750\nand\n>> Right.\n\n32\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.750\nSo this is the little unusual SharePoint,\ncompared to other kinds of login.\n\n33\n00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.730\nThe least critical event.\n\n34\n00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.990\nSo, if I chose informational,\nthat means informational, warning,\n\n35\n00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.450\nerror, critical, etc., would hit the log.\n\n36\n00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.370\nBut it has to be verbose level includes\njust about everything you can imagine.\n\n37\n00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.220\nSo, I love how it says\nrestrict trace log space and\n\n38\n00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.985\nthe default is a thousand gigabytes.\n\n39\n00:02:06.985 --> 00:02:09.150\n>> {LAUGH]\n>> Terabyte should be enough.\n\n40\n00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.660\n>> Yeah.\n>> Made it ten gigs of storage.\n\n41\n00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.593\nTrace logging is really low level,\nsuper detailed,\n\n42\n00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:17.474\nthe kind of detail you're\nnot gonna need normally.\n\n43\n00:02:17.474 --> 00:02:21.099\nIt's only if you're on the phone,\ntypically at a product support service at\n\n44\n00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.001\nMicrosoft or some other vendor, they say\nplease capture a log of this trace log, or\n\n45\n00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:27.706\nverbose log for\n20 minutes with this service running.\n\n46\n00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:30.643\nAnd then FTP us the results,\nand then turn off.\n\n47\n00:02:30.643 --> 00:02:32.068\nYou've got to remember to turn off.\n\n48\n00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:33.949\n>> Yes.\n>> The trace or verbose log in,\n\n49\n00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:37.569\nbecause it's a performance hit, and\nit will fill up your drives for\n\n50\n00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:38.916\nno benefit whatsoever.\n\n51\n00:02:38.916 --> 00:02:42.960\nSo, I'm going to go down to\nmy web server extensions.\n\n52\n00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.088\nThe 16 hives, 16 refers to the Share Point\n2016 version of Share Point,\n\n53\n00:02:49.088 --> 00:02:53.053\nand already,\nafter enabling the verbose logging,\n\n54\n00:02:53.053 --> 00:02:57.129\nlook at all the information\nfilling up the log files.\n\n55\n00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.775\nAgain, more than you're normally gonna\nuse for any kind of troubleshooting,\n\n56\n00:03:01.775 --> 00:03:03.870\nbut at least you have that ability.\n\n57\n00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.900\nYou get granular too,\nin terms of which services or\n\n58\n00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.870\nfunctions within SharePoint, you wanna\nhave different levels of logging force.\n\n59\n00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.510\nYou've got the flexibility there.\n\n60\n00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.789\nThat's not going to health\nanalyze it though, and\n\n61\n00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:18.077\nwe'll click on review problems and\nsolutions, it seems so optimistic.\n\n62\n00:03:18.077 --> 00:03:21.609\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sometimes you can actually solve\n\n63\n00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.903\nproblems here, other times, not.\n\n64\n00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:26.551\nWell it's a neat functionality in here and\n\n65\n00:03:26.551 --> 00:03:29.870\nwe're gonna explore that\nas soon as this page opens.\n\n66\n00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.985\n>> It's thinking about it.\n\n67\n00:03:30.985 --> 00:03:31.485\n>> Well, that's true.\n\n68\n00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.081\nCome back next week and we'll.\n\n69\n00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:37.456\n>> Yeah, and while he is waiting for\nthat page to load up, and\n\n70\n00:03:37.456 --> 00:03:40.279\nwe've talked about that in say our\ngeneral server classes, right?\n\n71\n00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:43.119\nAuditing is very important, but\nit's also very important that\n\n72\n00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.554\nwe come up with a plan, think about what\nit is that you really need to capture.\n\n73\n00:03:46.554 --> 00:03:50.090\nBecause as Mark said, if you capture\ntoo much information, you're gonna miss\n\n74\n00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.435\nthe important stuff buried amongst\nthe things that aren't so important.\n\n75\n00:03:53.435 --> 00:03:56.139\nAnd it's also something\nthat if a problem comes up,\n\n76\n00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.089\nyou can go and\nturn on some of those additional loggings,\n\n77\n00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:02.731\nor more detail temporarily,\nwhile you're working on that problem.\n\n78\n00:04:02.731 --> 00:04:05.509\nAnd then trim it back down\nonce you've tested and\n\n79\n00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:08.980\nverified that your solution\nhas fixed the problem, right?\n\n80\n00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.898\nSo, we can always go back in and\nchange those auditing levels.\n\n81\n00:04:11.898 --> 00:04:14.968\nOtherwise, yeah, you're capturing\ninformation that that's never gonna be\n\n82\n00:04:14.968 --> 00:04:16.356\nreviewed and just taking up space.\n\n83\n00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:20.208\nAs you said, can start hurting\nperformance, if it has to write down every\n\n84\n00:04:20.208 --> 00:04:23.080\nlittle detail that is doing\nthat all the SQL server do.\n\n85\n00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.750\n>> In deed, all right, so\nnow some problems and solutions here,\n\n86\n00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.454\nvarious categories we've got security.\n\n87\n00:04:31.454 --> 00:04:36.101\nIt says the server farm account should not\nbe used for this services, my bad, whoops.\n\n88\n00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:38.070\n[LAUGH]\n>> I did that, but\n\n89\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.515\nit is a classroom environment, so\nthe spadmin account is being used for\n\n90\n00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:46.750\ntoo many tasks, according to Microsoft and\nthe powers that be.\n\n91\n00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.080\nSo, there's a link ID there for\nmore information.\n\n92\n00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.000\nI can go into the rule that triggered\nthat alert and edit the item.\n\n93\n00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.062\nSo just because it a rule that's\nconfigured in SharePoint,\n\n94\n00:04:59.062 --> 00:05:00.628\nI can tweak it for my purposes.\n\n95\n00:05:00.628 --> 00:05:04.062\nFor example, some of the rules\nmay not apply in my environment.\n\n96\n00:05:04.062 --> 00:05:07.180\nAnd I don't wanna be warned,\nI don't wanna log entries to be made,\n\n97\n00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.149\nbecause I've configured my servers or\nservices a certain way.\n\n98\n00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:14.630\nI know what I'm doing, so let's turn\noff that rule, or modify that rule.\n\n99\n00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.426\nJust like you could\nwith a management pack.\n\n100\n00:05:17.426 --> 00:05:22.657\nLet's say you've got your SharePoint\nmanagement pack in an SCOM context, you\n\n101\n00:05:22.657 --> 00:05:28.213\ncan tweak the rules that exist there as\nwell, that's a whole other concept though.\n\n102\n00:05:28.213 --> 00:05:31.205\nSo, various categories here, performance.\n\n103\n00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:37.650\nSo, you can see they're check for daily,\nweekly, or hourly, configuration,\n\n104\n00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.110\nrules pertaining to missing server\nside dependencies, for example.\n\n105\n00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.798\nAnd whenever you see a long\nlist like this at SharePoint,\n\n106\n00:05:45.798 --> 00:05:48.431\nthere's probably another\npage at least worth of data.\n\n107\n00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:52.030\nSo look for the sometimes\nobscure arrows at the bottom, or\n\n108\n00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.490\nway at the top of the page,\nat the right hand side.\n\n109\n00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.640\nSo you can scroll through and\nlook at the different options.\n\n110\n00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.776\nSo there's an availability category,\nwere not going to cover all of them.\n\n111\n00:06:00.776 --> 00:06:03.420\nI just want to show you\nthe screens with the information.\n\n112\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.069\nYou can pause the video and\ncheck them out yourself.\n\n113\n00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:08.450\nUnless you're a speed reader with\na photographic memory, in which case,\n\n114\n00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.968\nyou've already committed\nthese things to memory.\n\n115\n00:06:09.968 --> 00:06:12.624\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so again,\n\n116\n00:06:12.624 --> 00:06:15.339\nvarious categories here.\n\n117\n00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:16.717\nNow let's go into one.\n\n118\n00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.735\nWhich one will it be.\n\n119\n00:06:20.735 --> 00:06:22.385\n>> Eeny meeny miny mo.\n\n120\n00:06:22.385 --> 00:06:23.709\n>> Yes.\n\n121\n00:06:25.915 --> 00:06:28.539\nOkay, it doesn't really matter.\n\n122\n00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:31.914\nI will go into our previous page.\n\n123\n00:06:31.914 --> 00:06:32.991\n>> You got your favorite\nyou're looking for.\n\n124\n00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:38.270\n>> Yeah, that's true I am, I confess.\n\n125\n00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.336\nLet's go into reviewing rule definitions.\n\n126\n00:06:46.241 --> 00:06:49.984\nIt's always right there, sometime we\nget that if we use the back arrow\n\n127\n00:06:49.984 --> 00:06:52.974\nindiscriminately and\nthen end up where we were before.\n\n128\n00:06:52.974 --> 00:06:57.136\nOkay, I'm gonna click on one or\nmore categories I configured\n\n129\n00:06:57.136 --> 00:07:02.099\nwith verbose trace logging, which I\njust set up to trigger this alert, or\n\n130\n00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:06.046\nI can check for the presence of\nthat by clicking on run now.\n\n131\n00:07:06.046 --> 00:07:10.061\nSo you saw there, you could see\nthe schedule is set to check daily,\n\n132\n00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:12.801\nwhich can be anytime in a 24-hour period.\n\n133\n00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:15.965\nBut like other examples in this class,\nwe can't wait around for\n\n134\n00:07:15.965 --> 00:07:17.850\nthe next regular timer job to kick in.\n\n135\n00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.166\nWe can kick start it and have it run now.\n\n136\n00:07:20.166 --> 00:07:25.403\nSo now while that's happening,\nwe'll switch over here to my SQL box and,\n\n137\n00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:29.310\nI love how you can type in\nthe abbreviations, so SSMS for\n\n138\n00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.739\nSQL Server Management Studio and\nthat fires up.\n\n139\n00:07:34.027 --> 00:07:37.350\nAnd again,\ndrill down inside the databases.\n\n140\n00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.500\nSpecifically, my WSS log in database.\n\n141\n00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.260\nSo there's often debris, Windows\nSharePoint services, and old terminology.\n\n142\n00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.860\nSo that, you can expect that kind of\nan homage to the past, if you will.\n\n143\n00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.730\nLet's stretch out these system views.\n\n144\n00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:59.590\nSo this is how we get our reports\ngenerated based on queries,\n\n145\n00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.160\nthere's login operations here,\nservice call.\n\n146\n00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.730\nSo developers would have certain\ninterest in these views and\n\n147\n00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.070\nas admins we have interest in other views.\n\n148\n00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.929\nSo let's look at the timer\njob usage right now, and\n\n149\n00:08:12.929 --> 00:08:15.398\nI'll just choose the top 1,000 rows.\n\n150\n00:08:17.952 --> 00:08:22.840\nLet that load up.\n\n151\n00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.850\nNow we've got data at the bottom which is\nnot the most useful format to parse in.\n\n152\n00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.610\nAlthough depending on what you're\nlooking for, you may just be looking for\n\n153\n00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.480\na column like a status number.\n\n154\n00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.250\nBut you could also pull that up in Excel,\nand, connect to the data source from\n\n155\n00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.540\nexcel and then analyze or\nassort columns or filter, based on Excel.\n\n156\n00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.259\nBut for now I want to show you\nthe developer tools available.\n\n157\n00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:48.618\nBy going to network nav 12 this is kinda\nof cool, if you've ever seen this,\n\n158\n00:08:48.618 --> 00:08:52.660\nwhere do the elements come from when\nit load any given SharePoint page.\n\n159\n00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:57.036\nSo let's explore that,\nso I fired up F12 here,\n\n160\n00:08:57.036 --> 00:09:03.303\nI went to network tab and I'm going\nto enable network traffic capture.\n\n161\n00:09:03.303 --> 00:09:08.086\nAnd now I need to go to a webpage\nto get some network traffic.\n\n162\n00:09:08.086 --> 00:09:09.572\nCross town traffic.\n\n163\n00:09:09.572 --> 00:09:12.387\nAll right, so there's my acme team site.\n\n164\n00:09:12.387 --> 00:09:15.925\nAnd look at all\nthe information down below.\n\n165\n00:09:15.925 --> 00:09:22.946\nI'll stretch it up soon, make it bigger\nhere, but first of all stop the capture.\n\n166\n00:09:22.946 --> 00:09:29.418\nAnd the various tabs here, so\nI can scroll down to there.\n\n167\n00:09:29.418 --> 00:09:32.143\nBut typically,\nyou want to make it full screen.\n\n168\n00:09:32.143 --> 00:09:37.003\nAnd you can sort and\nfilter by URL, by protocol type,\n\n169\n00:09:37.003 --> 00:09:41.323\nand you've got a,\nwhat is that, a spark line or\n\n170\n00:09:41.323 --> 00:09:45.441\nhorizontal bar chart\nidea with the timings.\n\n171\n00:09:45.441 --> 00:09:46.798\nIt's not an exact number,\n\n172\n00:09:46.798 --> 00:09:50.290\nyou can see the exact number in\na couple columns over the taken column.\n\n173\n00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.047\nOkay, I'm going to max it out here, so\n\n174\n00:09:53.047 --> 00:09:57.740\nyou can see the relative timings\nwhen elements load onto the page.\n\n175\n00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.237\nLook at the literally dozens of elements\nthat make up the most basic page.\n\n176\n00:10:02.237 --> 00:10:05.483\nSo this gives you some\nexplanation at least, for\n\n177\n00:10:05.483 --> 00:10:08.571\nwhy some pages seem to\ntake a long time to load,\n\n178\n00:10:08.571 --> 00:10:13.103\neven if you throw a lot of resources\nin your SharePoint deployment.\n\n179\n00:10:13.103 --> 00:10:15.503\nYou've got high IO with your SQL backend.\n\n180\n00:10:15.503 --> 00:10:18.888\nSo, this is kinda neat, cuz then you can\ntroubleshoot and say okay, that image,\n\n181\n00:10:18.888 --> 00:10:20.672\ndoes it really need to be eight megabytes?\n\n182\n00:10:20.672 --> 00:10:21.424\nProbably not.\n\n183\n00:10:21.424 --> 00:10:22.262\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n184\n00:10:22.262 --> 00:10:26.441\n>> You know, of someone eating a burger or\nsomething Some bogus image from\n\n185\n00:10:26.441 --> 00:10:31.249\nthe picnic, so this, you can actually\nidentify, okay, what are the elements of\n\n186\n00:10:31.249 --> 00:10:35.987\nthe page that are slowing things down,\ncan we make the image format smaller, for\n\n187\n00:10:35.987 --> 00:10:38.863\nexample, can we do a way\nwith that all together.\n\n188\n00:10:38.863 --> 00:10:42.588\nSo, at least it takes away some of\nthe mystery as to why a certain element\n\n189\n00:10:42.588 --> 00:10:45.146\nshouldn't paid it's load\nslower than others.\n\n190\n00:10:45.146 --> 00:10:45.689\n>> Very nice.\n\n191\n00:10:45.689 --> 00:10:49.133\n>> Maybe it's a custom\nmaster page you created, or\n\n192\n00:10:49.133 --> 00:10:53.083\nyour SharePoint designer\npermission person created.\n\n193\n00:10:53.083 --> 00:10:57.560\nAnd maybe some element of that design\nis again and slowing things down.\n\n194\n00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.178\nSo this gives you the facts and\n\n195\n00:11:01.178 --> 00:11:05.236\nthen you can analyse from there.\n\n196\n00:11:05.236 --> 00:11:09.308\nNow, back into my SharePoint\n2016 management shell.\n\n197\n00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:16.938\nI'll clear the screen there to tidy\nthings up, we'll spring cleaning,\n\n198\n00:11:16.938 --> 00:11:20.454\nand now,\nI'm gonna define a content variable.\n\n199\n00:11:26.836 --> 00:11:29.421\nThis one will\n\n200\n00:11:29.421 --> 00:11:38.432\nbe\nMicrosoft.SharePoint.adminstration.spwebs-\n\n201\n00:11:38.432 --> 00:11:42.118\nervice.\n\n202\n00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:45.714\nSo what we're doing here,\nis we're enabling the developer dashboard,\n\n203\n00:11:45.714 --> 00:11:47.929\nthat's the purpose of this little section.\n\n204\n00:11:47.929 --> 00:11:49.810\n::content service.\n\n205\n00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.759\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n206\n00:11:52.759 --> 00:11:59.616\n>> I'll define another variable here, and\nthis one will be the app setting variable.\n\n207\n00:11:59.616 --> 00:12:00.916\nHopefully it's not upsetting.\n\n208\n00:12:00.916 --> 00:12:03.284\n[LAUGH] Okay, that's ridiculous.\n\n209\n00:12:03.284 --> 00:12:08.068\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Boy.\n\n210\n00:12:08.068 --> 00:12:09.693\nAll right, it's late in the course.\n\n211\n00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:16.589\n>> All right, so, dashboard developer\nsettings, and then we want to setup\n\n212\n00:12:18.726 --> 00:12:22.450\nApp saying dot display, level.\n\n213\n00:12:24.725 --> 00:12:26.304\nEquals.\n\n214\n00:12:31.343 --> 00:12:36.823\nThis will be Microsoft.sharepoint\n\n215\n00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:42.512\n.administration.\n\n216\n00:12:52.078 --> 00:13:01.148\n.spdeveloperdashboard,\n\n217\n00:13:01.148 --> 00:13:05.685\nlevel and on.\n\n218\n00:13:10.233 --> 00:13:13.108\nI must have hit a wrong character there,\n\n219\n00:13:13.108 --> 00:13:16.503\nbecause I got the prompt\nI wasn't looking for.\n\n220\n00:13:16.503 --> 00:13:19.435\nAnd see what happens though,\nhey experiment,\n\n221\n00:13:19.435 --> 00:13:21.789\nwhat's the worst that could happen.\n\n222\n00:13:21.789 --> 00:13:28.555\nThe form deletes, no, so\nwhat did I do wrong here.\n\n223\n00:13:28.555 --> 00:13:34.104\nOkay, so where it says\ndos.appsetting.dislaylevel equals\n\n224\n00:13:34.104 --> 00:13:39.033\nI should have used a square brace,\nnot the curly brace.\n\n225\n00:13:39.033 --> 00:13:41.163\nBoth of those are above the enter key.\n\n226\n00:13:41.163 --> 00:13:45.867\nSo, whenever you get a prompt like that,\nthat you're not expecting, check your\n\n227\n00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:50.455\nsyntax, or, if you're pulling your hair\nout, maybe you've run out of hair.\n\n228\n00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:52.045\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Have someone else,\n\n229\n00:13:52.045 --> 00:13:55.840\nthere's another set of eyes look at it,\neven if they're not a dev type, or\n\n230\n00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.543\nan admin type, just looking at.\n\n231\n00:13:57.543 --> 00:13:58.685\nIf we're really gonna scream for\n\n232\n00:13:58.685 --> 00:14:00.639\ntoo long, some of this we\ndon't see our same mistake, or\n\n233\n00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:03.390\nwe keep entering the same mistake over and\nover not realized we're doing that.\n\n234\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:07.153\nSo especially when you got\ndifferent kinds of brackets right,\n\n235\n00:14:07.153 --> 00:14:11.058\nyou've got the regular round one,\nyou've got the curly brace,\n\n236\n00:14:11.058 --> 00:14:15.396\nyou've got the square brackets, so\nit's easy to make a mistake there.\n\n237\n00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:17.930\n>> That happened many a times,\nstaring at that screen and\n\n238\n00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:19.536\ncan't figure out what's wrong.\n\n239\n00:14:19.536 --> 00:14:23.329\nAnd somebody walks by and\nsays you're missing a quote at the end.\n\n240\n00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:26.704\nYeah, like you said, just staring at that\nscreen too long you miss those things.\n\n241\n00:14:26.704 --> 00:14:27.801\n>> Where were you an hour ago?\n\n242\n00:14:27.801 --> 00:14:29.905\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n243\n00:14:29.905 --> 00:14:31.182\n>> And why are you looking at my screen?\n\n244\n00:14:31.182 --> 00:14:33.164\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Thank you.\n\n245\n00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:35.841\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so I fixed that,\n\n246\n00:14:35.841 --> 00:14:37.112\nnow the square brace.\n\n247\n00:14:39.974 --> 00:14:42.198\nOkay, sorry I talked over you there Mike.\n\n248\n00:14:42.198 --> 00:14:43.310\n>> That's all right.\n>> All right.\n\n249\n00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.468\nSo, now let's see what happens.\n\n250\n00:14:46.468 --> 00:14:50.427\nSo we've enabled the SharePoint\ndeveloper dashboard, and\n\n251\n00:14:50.427 --> 00:14:53.848\nnow I'm going to review\nSharePoint page load data.\n\n252\n00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:08.117\nSo, now we have the button on\nthe far right side, that's appeared,\n\n253\n00:15:08.117 --> 00:15:11.703\nthat's the developer dashboard, this is\npretty cool, even if you're not at dev,\n\n254\n00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:12.781\nyou can pretend you are.\n\n255\n00:15:12.781 --> 00:15:14.569\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Check it out,\n\n256\n00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:17.410\npretend you know what this is all about.\n\n257\n00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:21.621\nSo we'll look at some of the tabs there.\n\n258\n00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:26.381\nCtrl+F will do it.\n\n259\n00:15:26.381 --> 00:15:29.075\nWell, let's refresh that page.\n\n260\n00:15:36.839 --> 00:15:43.345\nJust go there,\n\n261\n00:15:43.345 --> 00:15:50.351\nRefresh, allow\n\n262\n00:15:50.351 --> 00:15:53.856\npop up.\n\n263\n00:15:53.856 --> 00:15:58.530\nOne more tab, click on my\n\n264\n00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:02.986\ndeveloper dashboard.\n\n265\n00:16:02.986 --> 00:16:08.399\nSo we can see here the requests,\nincluding the developer\n\n266\n00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:13.036\ndashboard requests, so\nthe homepage is there.\n\n267\n00:16:13.036 --> 00:16:17.828\nThen when I select an option request,\nthen you can see here the duration,\n\n268\n00:16:17.828 --> 00:16:19.030\neven the CPU hit.\n\n269\n00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.169\nThat's kind of cool.\n\n270\n00:16:20.169 --> 00:16:22.969\nAll right, so\nin the SQL tab here, you can see,\n\n271\n00:16:22.969 --> 00:16:27.178\nlook at the round trip times there\nto access content from the database.\n\n272\n00:16:27.178 --> 00:16:31.204\nYou can see here the reads,\nthe CPU performance, impact.\n\n273\n00:16:31.204 --> 00:16:35.943\nSo again,\na lot of storage in SQL on the back end.\n\n274\n00:16:35.943 --> 00:16:42.100\nAnd that's why we wanna have high I/O\nperformance with SQL wherever possible.\n\n275\n00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.791\n>> Very good, all right Mark.\n\n276\n00:16:43.791 --> 00:16:47.897\nAgain, a great demonstration there,\na really good look where we can go to find\n\n277\n00:16:47.897 --> 00:16:51.631\nout what's going on with our share\npoint deployment, monitoring it,\n\n278\n00:16:51.631 --> 00:16:55.553\nmonitoring those log files, how to\nconfigure, how much we're logging or\n\n279\n00:16:55.553 --> 00:16:57.636\nauditing, what detail level we want.\n\n280\n00:16:57.636 --> 00:16:58.945\nSo we can just keep on top of things.\n\n281\n00:16:58.945 --> 00:17:02.416\nWe want to be proactive\nrather than reactive.\n\n282\n00:17:02.416 --> 00:17:05.321\nWant to keep that SharePoint\nrunning at peak performance so\n\n283\n00:17:05.321 --> 00:17:08.470\nour users enjoy the experience and\ncontinue to use SharePoint.\n\n284\n00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.290\nSo, we thank you for\nthat demonstration, Mark.\n\n285\n00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.644\nWe hope everyone out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n286\n00:17:12.644 --> 00:17:15.360\nSigning off from ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n287\n00:17:15.360 -->

at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:18.280\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.870\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna change it up a little bit, right.\n\n6\n00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.618\nEverything we've done so far, has been\ndealing with SharePoint on premise.\n\n7\n00:00:27.618 --> 00:00:30.750\nNow we're gonna take a look at some\nof the offerings of SharePoint Online\n\n8\n00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.250\nand Office 365.\n\n9\n00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.710\nAnd here to help us with that of course,\nis Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n10\n00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.660\nHow's it going, Mark?\n\n11\n00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.670\n>> Thanks, Mike, great.\n\n12\n00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.540\nSo keep in mind,\na lot of Microsoft's development efforts,\n\n13\n00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.000\nwhen it comes to SharePoint,\nin fact almost all of are in the cloud.\n\n14\n00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.130\nSo theres minor tweaks to\nthe omprem bridges SharePoint but\n\n15\n00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.860\na lot of the cutting edge\nstuff that lives in the Cloud.\n\n16\n00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.770\nSo lets see the various\nways we can get started and\n\n17\n00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.290\nreally you just want to sign up.\n\n18\n00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.140\nIf my main thrust with this\nepisode is to get you to sign up,\n\n19\n00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.600\nget a trial account free for 30 days.\n\n20\n00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.621\nAnd just start playing\naround in the interface.\n\n21\n00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:06.260\nSo I started what you need to do.\n\n22\n00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.440\nOkay, so\nI've filled out my profile information.\n\n23\n00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.800\nAnd the crucial thing on this\nscreen is the user type.\n\n24\n00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.350\nSo I'm either a Microsoft customer or\na Microsoft partner.\n\n25\n00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.050\nSo is it just me,\nmy deployment managing or am I a reseller.\n\n26\n00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.420\nBecause then I'll get a different\ninterface with tools to manage\n\n27\n00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.620\nmultiple different organizations.\n\n28\n00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.032\nBut for this I'll choose\nMicrosoft customer and Save.\n\n29\n00:01:45.662 --> 00:01:48.589\nAnd there's a little green box saying,\nFastTrack success.\n\n30\n00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.220\nAnd welcome to FastTrack.\n\n31\n00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.952\nSo there's all kinds of\nprescriptive guides.\n\n32\n00:01:52.952 --> 00:01:55.810\nI'm gonna show you some of\nthe websites you should go to\n\n33\n00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.718\nas you embark on your\nSharePoint Online journey.\n\n34\n00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:05.350\nAnd I could plan later, and we've\ntalked about the danger of doing that,\n\n35\n00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.670\nbut for the purposes of this demo,\nthat's what I'm gonna select.\n\n36\n00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.940\nAnd notice how there's a place there for\nmy logo.\n\n37\n00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.980\nThere's information about how to\nuse FastTrack and what's in it.\n\n38\n00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.553\nSo Microsoft realizes it's a big shift for\npeople to go from an on-prem world\n\n39\n00:02:21.553 --> 00:02:25.590\nto hybrid environment, where you've got\non-prem and cloud or fully into the cloud.\n\n40\n00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.540\nSo rather than just\nthrow you to the wolves,\n\n41\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.990\nthey gave you great prescriptive\nguidance to help you move some or\n\n42\n00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.505\nall of your work loads to the cloud.\n\n43\n00:02:36.505 --> 00:02:38.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So the onboarding process.\n\n44\n00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.550\nAnd Microsoft has the specific support,\n\n45\n00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.970\nfast track engineers that\nhave done this before.\n\n46\n00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.389\nAnd they can help you in your deployment.\n\n47\n00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.162\nSo just knowing where the help is,\nis a big part of a successful deployment.\n\n48\n00:02:55.162 --> 00:03:01.183\nVarious tabs here,\nis it getting started tab.\n\n49\n00:03:01.183 --> 00:03:08.280\nNow I could extend my Office 365 travel\nthrough a variety of price points\n\n50\n00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.250\ndepending on the number of users you want\nto move to the Cloud Enterprise related.\n\n51\n00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.430\nSo E3, E5 for example, and they're\noften shifting with the deals on those.\n\n52\n00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.452\nBut you can extend for\nup to 90 days, which is good.\n\n53\n00:03:20.452 --> 00:03:25.777\nThe sandbox environment\n\n54\n00:03:25.777 --> 00:03:31.210\nis a way to experiment and\nplay in a safe environment\n\n55\n00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.200\nthat you can't in fact move anything\nyou do in the sandbox into production.\n\n56\n00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.220\nSo it's good to play in\na non-production environment and\n\n57\n00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.660\nthis will get you more\ncomfortable with the interface.\n\n58\n00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.770\nThere's also a variety of scenarios\nlisted at the bottom of this page\n\n59\n00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.280\ndepending on your primary interests.\n\n60\n00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.610\nAre you a sales and\nmarketing division for example?\n\n61\n00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.320\nIs your interest in SharePoint online?\n\n62\n00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.670\nI know 365 more IT related.\n\n63\n00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.540\nLegal.\n\n64\n00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.170\nSo there is various scenarios\nthere that will help you.\n\n65\n00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.060\nAnd Microsoft is always looking for\nfeed back, so you can say,\n\n66\n00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.650\nwas this page helpful yes or no,\nand provide that response and\n\n67\n00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.670\nthen maybe they'll improve\nthe interface based on your feedback.\n\n68\n00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.175\nOffers, so some of these so called\ncurrent offers are no longer current.\n\n69\n00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:19.470\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n70\n00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.400\n>> But It's good to see what's available,\nso SharePoint and\n\n71\n00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.870\nProject there's a lot of integration\nthere both on prem and online.\n\n72\n00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.230\nThere's enterprise mobility,\nsuite offer you\n\n73\n00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.810\ncould see that the current status of\nthe offer whether it's available or not.\n\n74\n00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.580\nCloud PBX that's kind of cool.\n\n75\n00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.630\nSo those are some current offers then\nwe also have history tab as well,\n\n76\n00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.260\nO365 and option E4.\n\n77\n00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.990\nSo it always gonna be deals just like\nwith car sales, there's a sale event.\n\n78\n00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.210\nThere's always a sales event.\n\n79\n00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.590\n>> We use the Cloud base\nPVX here in ITProTV.\n\n80\n00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.860\n>> Nice, very cool.\n\n81\n00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.290\nThere's a gig kit if you want some slag.\n\n82\n00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.555\nYou can click on redeem now,\none per customer.\n\n83\n00:05:02.555 --> 00:05:03.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n84\n00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.580\nthen it gets shipped to your address.\n\n85\n00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.085\nIt's always good to get swag.\n\n86\n00:05:09.085 --> 00:05:11.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then there's so\n\n87\n00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.870\nmuch you can do in the Cloud.\n\n88\n00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:19.110\nSo InTune is your rights managements,\nyou my wanna include.\n\n89\n00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.276\nAnd I notice helpful buttons there to\nlearn more about any of those offers.\n\n90\n00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:26.880\nThere's a tab here for team members.\n\n91\n00:05:28.413 --> 00:05:32.280\nSo right now, it's just me but\nI could add my contacts.\n\n92\n00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.510\nMicrosoft, maybe some fast\ntrack at option engineers.\n\n93\n00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.530\nI could have a partner organization,\nI could add people in those sections.\n\n94\n00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.781\nSo because we're collaborating and\ngetting support, and\n\n95\n00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:46.681\ngiving support it's nice to have one\nplace to go, where anyone that has\n\n96\n00:05:46.681 --> 00:05:50.408\nany to do with your deployment of\nO365 is listed in that section.\n\n97\n00:05:52.697 --> 00:05:56.980\nOkay, and what if I want to share my plan?\n\n98\n00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.492\nI could do that.\n\n99\n00:06:01.211 --> 00:06:02.697\nClick on Dashboard.\n\n100\n00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.780\nWhich I was just there,\nso let's go into support.\n\n101\n00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.970\nSo I need support tickets, so because\nMicrosoft often deploys cutting edge\n\n102\n00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.770\ntechnology to the cloud, so\nit's a much faster refresh cycle it's nice\n\n103\n00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.080\nto be able to have one place\nto tack support tickets.\n\n104\n00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.660\nAnd then resources, there's a variety\nof guides, little quick start videos.\n\n105\n00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.670\nWhich will help get you going on\nthings like site customization.\n\n106\n00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.860\nSo we can just in time learning,\nbite size learning when we need it,\n\n107\n00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.110\nbecause it can be an intimidating place,\nthe online world throughout 365 and\n\n108\n00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.710\nSharePoint and other new technologies that\nyou probably haven't even heard of yet.\n\n109\n00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.230\nSo Microsoft holds you by the hand if\nyou like to make it easier for you with\n\n110\n00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:53.060\nsupport team members and instructional\nvideos and all kinds of other resources.\n\n111\n00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.990\nSo now I wanna show you what looks\nlike the sigh up for the Sandbox.\n\n112\n00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.830\nRemember, that's that play environment,\n\n113\n00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.500\nwe can't port anything from the Sandbox to\nproduction but it's a safe place to play.\n\n114\n00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.400\nIt explores the technology,\nexplore the interface.\n\n115\n00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.760\n>> Without the fear of bringing\nyour production set up down.\n\n116\n00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.935\n>> Exactly, or the dreaded RPE\nthe Resume Producing Event.\n\n117\n00:07:17.935 --> 00:07:20.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I click on Sandbox.\n\n118\n00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.620\nThere's a blue bar,\na thin blue line at the top of the screen.\n\n119\n00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.410\nThat's your loading bar.\n\n120\n00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.675\nIt beats the hypnotic circle.\n\n121\n00:07:26.675 --> 00:07:29.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you like.\n\n122\n00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.739\nOkay.\nAnd then eventually,\n\n123\n00:07:30.739 --> 00:07:32.245\nwe got a new page popping up.\n\n124\n00:07:34.151 --> 00:07:35.645\nOr my name isn't Fred Smith.\n\n125\n00:07:35.645 --> 00:07:38.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n126\n00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.720\nNow I can scroll down there.\n\n127\n00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.870\nSo requested by me.\n\n128\n00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:47.580\nShows the request date and the number\nof days remaining in my sandbox trial.\n\n129\n00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.160\nAnd again, useful.\n\n130\n00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.436\nIt's good to have in-private\nbrowsing sessions.\n\n131\n00:07:52.436 --> 00:07:57.788\nThis means, you can have a variety of\nsessions in one Internet Explorer instance\n\n132\n00:07:57.788 --> 00:08:03.080\nwith different tabs as if you were logged\nin on different machines for example.\n\n133\n00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.967\nSo you get the isolation\nusing in private browsing.\n\n134\n00:08:06.967 --> 00:08:09.950\nSo as you can see, there's support for\ndifferent scenarios in your\n\n135\n00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.052\nsandbox trowel, and you get 40 days,\nroughly, 39-40 days.\n\n136\n00:08:13.052 --> 00:08:13.888\n>> Nice.\n\n137\n00:08:13.888 --> 00:08:17.460\n>> Right, so,\ni've to go back to my screen please.\n\n138\n00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.030\nSo here's the Welcome to Fast Track again.\n\n139\n00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.730\nGrab my quick tour option on the right.\n\n140\n00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:28.850\nAnd then again other tools to\nhelp you in terms of Services,\n\n141\n00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.350\nGetting Started, Offers.\n\n142\n00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.283\nNow, I want to show you some\nother websites before going into\n\n143\n00:08:34.283 --> 00:08:37.216\nthe Office admin interface that\nI found extremely useful and\n\n144\n00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:39.670\nyou may want to search there right now.\n\n145\n00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:47.178\nSharePoint Online Planning Guide for\nOffice 365 for business.\n\n146\n00:08:47.178 --> 00:08:51.140\nAnd very useful, because we have\nsuch a delegated admin model\n\n147\n00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.120\nin SharePoint with forum admins, site\ncollection admins, site administrators.\n\n148\n00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.370\nIt's easy to overwhelm unless you're\ngetting information that relates to your\n\n149\n00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.210\njob role, so very helpful.\n\n150\n00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.149\nWho does this?\n\n151\n00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.110\nFor setting up your\nSharePoint Online environment.\n\n152\n00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.980\nWe'll that's a global admin,\nforum admin kind of rule.\n\n153\n00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:14.638\nSo, we can set up file storage in\nsettings, and sharing, global settings,\n\n154\n00:09:14.638 --> 00:09:17.801\nsite collections,\nwhich I'll show you how you to.\n\n155\n00:09:17.801 --> 00:09:20.443\nAnd then planning for\nsites and managing users,\n\n156\n00:09:20.443 --> 00:09:22.512\nthis would be site collection admin.\n\n157\n00:09:22.512 --> 00:09:27.119\nSo one significant layer down from\nyour global admins in terms of\n\n158\n00:09:27.119 --> 00:09:31.940\norganizing site content,\nplanning content features.\n\n159\n00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.176\nSo we'll go through all of these.\n\n160\n00:09:35.256 --> 00:09:38.940\nI keep scrolling down here,\nuseful online resources.\n\n161\n00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.650\nSo please go there.\n\n162\n00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:48.026\nSharePoint Online Planning Guide for\nO 365 for business.\n\n163\n00:09:48.026 --> 00:09:48.947\nNow.\n\n164\n00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:57.866\nOkay, so there's another useful page and\nthis is Solutions using Office Servers and\n\n165\n00:09:57.866 --> 00:09:59.040\nthe Cloud.\n\n166\n00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.360\nThis is very important.\n\n167\n00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.770\nBecause there's so much functionality\nthat can live in the cloud and/or on-prem\n\n168\n00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:09.570\nwith Azure, and we'll show you some\nAzure connection in a different episode.\n\n169\n00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.730\nSo, DirSync, so syncing your active\ndirectory environment on-prem and\n\n170\n00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.230\nwith Azure.\n\n171\n00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.280\nDisaster recovery for SharePoint in Azure.\n\n172\n00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.360\nAuthentication, various architectures and\nthen a test lab guide,\n\n173\n00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.510\nif you wanna build your own, so this is\nanother very useful place to explore.\n\n174\n00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.800\nAnd your learning journey for SharePoint\nand SharePoint Online and that's servers\n\n175\n00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:35.560\nusing Office, sorry, Solutions\nusing Office Servers and the Cloud.\n\n176\n00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.470\nOkay, so let's now go into\nmy Office admin environment.\n\n177\n00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.180\nAnd we have a variety of things to\nlook at here, there's the waffle.\n\n178\n00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.910\nSometimes the waffle is on\nthe left depending on your\n\n179\n00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:53.434\nbrowser size and resolution,\nobjects can move.\n\n180\n00:10:53.434 --> 00:10:55.960\nAnd so there maybe more or less\nscrolling depending on your screen size.\n\n181\n00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.961\nSo the waffle shows you other\napplications available to you.\n\n182\n00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:05.146\nFor example, Yammer, which is Facebook for\nbusiness essentially.\n\n183\n00:11:05.146 --> 00:11:09.337\nOneDrive connections, Sites,\nDelve is pretty cool,\n\n184\n00:11:09.337 --> 00:11:12.286\nwe'll look at that, and Sway as well.\n\n185\n00:11:12.286 --> 00:11:17.980\nAnd then there's an Admin console as well,\nso a little shortcut to get there.\n\n186\n00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.500\nAny notifications here?\n\n187\n00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.050\nHere's a notification for me for Yammer.\n\n188\n00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:29.420\nAnd then the gear icon, I can change\na theme and go into my O 365 settings.\n\n189\n00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:35.468\nSo, for now, let's get rid of that, okay?\n\n190\n00:11:35.468 --> 00:11:40.590\nAnd I gonna full screen this here\nto get the most of the real estate.\n\n191\n00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.831\nSo, now Microsoft's getting a little\nmore folksy over the years.\n\n192\n00:11:43.831 --> 00:11:47.322\nSo, no, it says,\nyour Office 365 setup is incomplete.\n\n193\n00:11:47.322 --> 00:11:50.570\nI'm gonna minimize to get\nsome more screen real estate.\n\n194\n00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:55.874\nI'm going to shift over the Admin\ncenter preview options there.\n\n195\n00:11:55.874 --> 00:12:00.321\nAnd over time you'll get used\nto what these icons refer to.\n\n196\n00:12:00.321 --> 00:12:02.950\nAnd you can probably guess\nactually just by looking at them.\n\n197\n00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:07.005\nBut personally I like to see the words,\nbut just for\n\n198\n00:12:07.005 --> 00:12:10.884\nmore screen real estate\nwe can squish that over.\n\n199\n00:12:10.884 --> 00:12:15.326\nSo, I can do things like add users,\nsetup my DNS.\n\n200\n00:12:15.326 --> 00:12:20.780\nThere is a section here for billing,\neasily adding or deleting users.\n\n201\n00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:25.395\nNow, with O 365 you get a license to\ninstall the client apps right on your\n\n202\n00:12:25.395 --> 00:12:27.380\nmachine, multiple machines.\n\n203\n00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.560\nSo, I can install my software, I can share\nthe download link with others in my firm.\n\n204\n00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.180\nAnd there's a Message center as well.\n\n205\n00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:42.000\nRemember, Microsoft is frequently\nupdating information and functionality.\n\n206\n00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.760\nJust like Facebook, other vendors,\nthey're constantly experimenting\n\n207\n00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.530\nwith different tweaks and improvements,\nsome of which become permanent.\n\n208\n00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.700\nOthers, after a period of testing\nwith some guinea pig users\n\n209\n00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.820\nget retired because maybe the technology\ndidn't work the way it was supposed to.\n\n210\n00:12:58.820 --> 00:12:59.827\nSo there's constant change.\n\n211\n00:12:59.827 --> 00:13:03.453\nThe era of huge downloads of and\nplanning for\n\n212\n00:13:03.453 --> 00:13:07.275\nmajor release upgrades\nis not totally over but\n\n213\n00:13:07.275 --> 00:13:12.175\ncoming to a close in terms of\nclient OS' like Windows 10,\n\n214\n00:13:12.175 --> 00:13:15.217\nso multiple incremental upgrades.\n\n215\n00:13:15.217 --> 00:13:21.145\nAnd then online functionality provided for\nExchange, Project, SharePoint,\n\n216\n00:13:21.145 --> 00:13:28.470\nLync, so like Kaizen the Japanese say,\ncontinuous improvement, that is the model.\n\n217\n00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:33.278\nSo our job roles will change,\nso in a SharePoint context with\n\n218\n00:13:33.278 --> 00:13:37.911\nSharePoint Online,\nour DBA role is no longer necessary.\n\n219\n00:13:37.911 --> 00:13:44.719\nThink of Microsoft as the global admin or\nthe farm administrators for your farms.\n\n220\n00:13:44.719 --> 00:13:49.525\nSo some of the settings we're used to\naltering and becoming aware of through\n\n221\n00:13:49.525 --> 00:13:53.809\nour essential admin console in\na SharePoint on-prem deployment,\n\n222\n00:13:53.809 --> 00:13:58.380\nwe don't have those same settings\nin SharePoint Online deployment.\n\n223\n00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.109\nWhy?\nBecause Microsoft is taking care\n\n224\n00:14:00.109 --> 00:14:01.024\nof those settings.\n\n225\n00:14:01.024 --> 00:14:06.282\nSo never need to panic in terms of IT\njob roles, whatever technology gets\n\n226\n00:14:06.282 --> 00:14:12.248\nreplaced there's a need for perhaps a more\nadvanced perspective and abilities.\n\n227\n00:14:12.248 --> 00:14:17.210\nSo the change is good,\nit's a constant learning business.\n\n228\n00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.157\nOkay, so\nhere's the Message center as mentioned.\n\n229\n00:14:20.157 --> 00:14:21.207\nService health, so\n\n230\n00:14:21.207 --> 00:14:25.601\nyou'll find that Microsoft does have\nfinancially back service level agreements.\n\n231\n00:14:25.601 --> 00:14:29.939\nSay 99.9% up time, they will compensate\nyou if they feel they've reached\n\n232\n00:14:29.939 --> 00:14:33.450\nthat goal, but the point is\nthere's going to be some downtime.\n\n233\n00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.870\nIt's nice to have one place to go, and\nService health here where you can see,\n\n234\n00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.930\nbecause you wanna know in\nadvance before a customer or\n\n235\n00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.835\nuser complaint start coming in.\n\n236\n00:14:42.835 --> 00:14:47.472\nBut you can, I've encountered it,\nnot everyday but certainly more than once\n\n237\n00:14:47.472 --> 00:14:52.178\na week, when there is some service I've\nsubscribed to like Microsoft Intune,\n\n238\n00:14:52.178 --> 00:14:55.910\nSharePoint Online for example,\nLync that's not working.\n\n239\n00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.811\nNow, it's typically a few\nseconds to a few minutes,\n\n240\n00:14:57.811 --> 00:14:59.440\nyou might not even notice the outage.\n\n241\n00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.810\nBut it's nice to know that Microsoft\nis not trying to hide the fact\n\n242\n00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.550\nwhen a service is down or\nmaybe in your region, because\n\n243\n00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.220\nthere's various regions around the globe\nwhere you can get cloud functionality.\n\n244\n00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.951\nAnd depending on your subscription model,\nyou can have, say, three copies of\n\n245\n00:15:13.951 --> 00:15:17.918\nyour data up to a lot more,\nmaybe ten copies of your data globally.\n\n246\n00:15:17.918 --> 00:15:22.521\nSo, you pay for that, of course, but\nyou're paying for higher availability.\n\n247\n00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:24.920\nThe point is some services\nwill be down some of the time.\n\n248\n00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:30.940\nLet's see, there's a What's new section\nthere, Discover and learn, so that's cool.\n\n249\n00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.645\nAnd then there's a Need help,\nubiquitous Need help option there, and\n\n250\n00:15:34.645 --> 00:15:38.620\na feedback option at the bottom\nof the screen as well.\n\n251\n00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.100\nSo I click on Users here,\nI can see active users.\n\n252\n00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:45.420\nSo that's me.\n\n253\n00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.530\nThere's two of me apparently.\n\n254\n00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.580\nThere is me and mini me.\n\n255\n00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.185\nI don't know why I'm there twice.\n\n256\n00:15:51.185 --> 00:15:55.073\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And there's search fucntionality there.\n\n257\n00:15:55.073 --> 00:16:00.855\nContacts here, I can add a contact if\nI want, let see what happens there.\n\n258\n00:16:00.855 --> 00:16:05.178\nAnd for new contacts, so I just fill\nout the The identifying details and\n\n259\n00:16:05.178 --> 00:16:09.400\nthe ability to hide from\nthe organization address list is nice.\n\n260\n00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:15.260\nSo maybe it's a consultant or for\nsome reason someone's identity,\n\n261\n00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.590\nor the fact that they're even on\nthe list should be hidden from people.\n\n262\n00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.070\nMaybe certain people\nknow the email address.\n\n263\n00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:25.970\nBut that user should not be visible\nwhen scrolling through a global address\n\n264\n00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:26.760\nlist for example.\n\n265\n00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.670\nSo we have that capability.\n\n266\n00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.110\nI'll click on close there,\n\n267\n00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:35.100\nI can see deleted users,\nanother option and data migration.\n\n268\n00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.340\nSo Microsoft wants you\nto move to the cloud, so\n\n269\n00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.410\nas you'd expect they\ngive you tools to do so.\n\n270\n00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:43.500\nI'm gonna minimize my admin\ncenter preview again.\n\n271\n00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.330\nSo how can I get my Email\nmessages into the Cloud,\n\n272\n00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.390\nwell I can upload a PST file,\nremember those?\n\n273\n00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:56.370\nI can use one drive as a way to pivot\ninto the Cloud, even for my Yahoo mail.\n\n274\n00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.610\nIs Yahoo still around?\n\n275\n00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.640\n>> I believe so, I believe so.\n\n276\n00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:05.320\n>> Wow, okay, I know Microsoft was talking\nabout buying them, that was years ago.\n\n277\n00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:10.150\nGmail, Outlook, so there's ways of again\nmigrating content relating to email.\n\n278\n00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:11.440\nInto the cloud.\n\n279\n00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.110\nLet's look at groups now.\n\n280\n00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:17.990\nSo there's groups and shared mailboxes,\nI don't really have anything to say there.\n\n281\n00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:22.530\nResources, if you think of exchange,\nthose are your exchange amends or\n\n282\n00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:27.970\nhave ever reserved a room thru email or\na special piece of equipment.\n\n283\n00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.360\nThere's mailboxes for rooms.\n\n284\n00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.970\nSounds silly, but that's the way it goes.\n\n285\n00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.280\nLet's go there, rooms and equipment.\n\n286\n00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.590\nSo I can add a mailbox there.\n\n287\n00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:41.630\nThere's a site resources,\nbut more on sites later.\n\n288\n00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.820\nMobile management, whoops,\nlet's go into billing.\n\n289\n00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.920\nSo this is where I can manage licenses.\n\n290\n00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.610\nI can purchase additional services,\n\n291\n00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:55.005\nas my friend back home likes to say,\nbilling and chilling.\n\n292\n00:17:55.005 --> 00:17:57.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like a villain.\n\n293\n00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:02.260\nOkay, so it shows helpfully, so sometimes\nelements of Microsoft don't seem to talk\n\n294\n00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.735\nto each other, but in this case things\nare looking good because it shows my\n\n295\n00:18:05.735 --> 00:18:10.660\nO365 Business Premium Trial is\nrunning down, I'm down to 28 days.\n\n296\n00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:14.280\nRemember, from earlier in this episode\nwe looked at, it's very simple.\n\n297\n00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.810\nIt's one button to request\na 90 day extension.\n\n298\n00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.720\nSo there's really no excuse.\n\n299\n00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:25.360\nI implore you as a result of watching this\nepisode, just setup a bogus trial account,\n\n300\n00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:30.970\nmake up a name and do write down the user\nname you choose and your password.\n\n301\n00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:35.700\nBecause you might think I'll just\nremember it, but trust me, write it down.\n\n302\n00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.280\nEspecially, if you're dealing with\nmultiple technologies in the Cloud,\n\n303\n00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.090\nyou're gonna need multiple accounts.\n\n304\n00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.710\nAnd in my experience,\n\n305\n00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.430\nI've seen people pull their hair\nout trying to remember things.\n\n306\n00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.575\nJust write it down.\n\n307\n00:18:45.575 --> 00:18:48.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don't try and\n\n308\n00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.030\nremember all the account names,\npasswords, okay.\n\n309\n00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:52.950\nSo that's my blurb there.\n\n310\n00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:57.680\nSo it gives you some pricing details and\nhow many licenses you get and\n\n311\n00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.340\nwhat you get in terms of applications.\n\n312\n00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.300\nSo business essentials,\nthese most popular,\n\n313\n00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.630\nwe're not gonna cover all these right now.\n\n314\n00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:09.919\nBut just know that you have a variety of\noptions for various enterprise sizes and\n\n315\n00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:13.518\ndepending on the number of Microsoft\nrelated apps you want to use.\n\n316\n00:19:15.478 --> 00:19:18.335\nSometimes there is white screen,\na white screen of life.\n\n317\n00:19:18.335 --> 00:19:21.650\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Let's call it, going between sections.\n\n318\n00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:22.460\nOkay, we're back.\n\n319\n00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.619\nNow let's go into settings.\n\n320\n00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:32.645\nSo here is where we can, I'll scroll\ndown here, we have services and add-ins.\n\n321\n00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:38.380\nSo things like Azure and\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n322\n00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.540\nMFA is a big deal these days.\n\n323\n00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.750\nThe death of the password has\nbeen predicted for years, but\n\n324\n00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.470\nnow it is a lot closer.\n\n325\n00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:47.522\nHardly through technology\nlike Windows Hello,\n\n326\n00:19:47.522 --> 00:19:49.660\nwhich I came out in the Windows 10 era.\n\n327\n00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.660\nNow it's built in to laptops,\nit's also available for\n\n328\n00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:56.560\na couple 100,00 bucks\nthrough I believe it's Intel.\n\n329\n00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.690\nThe idea is it's facial\nrecognition that actually works,\n\n330\n00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.550\nyou can't just hold up a picture\nof Yoda anymore and log in.\n\n331\n00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:04.200\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> No, it's very complex,\n\n332\n00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:09.220\na lot of machine learning to\nuniquely identify your face, so\n\n333\n00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.790\nyou don't have to enter a password or\npin or use any kind of smartcard.\n\n334\n00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:19.240\nIt will use your face and if you think\nabout makeup, accidents, beard growth,\n\n335\n00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:23.860\nglasses, low light, all those things,\nis very, very few false positives.\n\n336\n00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.160\nSo it's a way to eliminate the password.\n\n337\n00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.020\nThere's also a backup plan like\nentering a pin for example, if for\n\n338\n00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.970\nsome reason it just can't read.\n\n339\n00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.640\nMaybe your camera broke, or\nmaybe it is too dark, but\n\n340\n00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.560\nit is infrared technology as well.\n\n341\n00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.420\nSo it's not just the visual,\n\n342\n00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.170\nthat's why you can't just hold up\na picture like it was referenced earlier.\n\n343\n00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:41.790\n>> Right, it can sense life there.\n\n344\n00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:42.750\n>> Exactly!\n\n345\n00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.800\nIt's aliveness detection, exactly right.\n\n346\n00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.791\nThat goes for thumb readers as well.\n\n347\n00:20:47.791 --> 00:20:52.154\nWell I won't go there, but\nit has to be [INAUDIBLE].\n\n348\n00:20:52.154 --> 00:20:53.159\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n349\n00:20:53.159 --> 00:20:55.748\n>> We have ways of making them pay.\n\n350\n00:20:55.748 --> 00:20:57.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, now what else do we have here?\n\n351\n00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.440\nWe've got calendar,\n\n352\n00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.680\nso the ability to share calendaring\ninformation with external users.\n\n353\n00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:07.320\nCortana, so\nthat's Microsoft's answer to Siri.\n\n354\n00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.780\nDirectory synchronization settings there\nagain, you're probably going to want to\n\n355\n00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:19.007\nsync up your Active Directory with AD.\n\n356\n00:21:19.007 --> 00:21:25.843\nOkay, Integrated apps there,\nmobile settings.\n\n357\n00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.950\nSkype for Business, you might be using.\n\n358\n00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.730\nYou can restrict which\nversions that your users.\n\n359\n00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:40.160\nRemember, you've got licenses to install\nthe regular versions of your Office apps.\n\n360\n00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.730\nYou can constrain which versions\nyour users are allowed to download.\n\n361\n00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:48.930\nNow, sometimes there's been cases where\nfor excel spreadsheets for example,\n\n362\n00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.630\nthere might be some functionality in\nexcel 2010 that's not available in 2013.\n\n363\n00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.210\nOr you haven't made the tweek to\nallow your formula say to work or\n\n364\n00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.060\nyour formulas in 2013.\n\n365\n00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.880\nSo the point is there might be\nreasons why you might wanna restrict\n\n366\n00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.680\nwhich versions of software\nis available for download.\n\n367\n00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.820\nThe restore settings as well.\n\n368\n00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.330\nWhich we can manage, so\nwe can make not just Microsoft\n\n369\n00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.450\napps available to our users in the Windows\nStore, but our own apps, sideloaded.\n\n370\n00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:21.220\nIn other words, pre-approved by us, so\nthat any items that, any applications that\n\n371\n00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:26.895\nappear in the store, that users access\nfrom logging in to our O365 environment.\n\n372\n00:22:26.895 --> 00:22:28.660\nTthey're preapproved, and\nthey're allowed to run them.\n\n373\n00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.080\nAnd then we can also\nmanage licensing as well.\n\n374\n00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.700\nSway is some really cool technology, which\nwe'll talk about in a future episode.\n\n375\n00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:41.190\nSecurity and privacy, so the default\npassword expiration is two years, and\n\n376\n00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:47.070\nyou just get notified a fort night before\nthat their password's about to expire.\n\n377\n00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.550\nAnd should people be able to\nreset their own passwords?\n\n378\n00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:51.048\nYeah!\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n379\n00:22:51.048 --> 00:22:53.910\n>> We want to eliminate silly calls to\n\n380\n00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.820\nthe help desk or that get escalated.\n\n381\n00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:00.090\nSo the more self-serve we empower\nthe user to do, the better it will be for\n\n382\n00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:00.600\neverybody.\n\n383\n00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:07.590\nAnd always a good idea to requite at\nleast an alternate phone number or\n\n384\n00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:09.750\nan alter email address.\n\n385\n00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.690\nWhen you just sign off that way\nthey can help to recover their own\n\n386\n00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.870\naccount if they forgot their password and\nthey've miss entered it too many times.\n\n387\n00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:18.870\nAgain, self service is the way to go.\n\n388\n00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:22.860\nI could add domains to my environment.\n\n389\n00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.770\nOrganization profile.\n\n390\n00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.340\nSo just like us,\nas users we have profiles.\n\n391\n00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.270\nSo does the organization.\n\n392\n00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:32.520\nAnd.\n\n393\n00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.430\nMy phone number's up there.\n\n394\n00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.360\nRelease preferences.\n\n395\n00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.330\nThis is cool.\n\n396\n00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:38.720\nSo we can determine,\n\n397\n00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.320\nthis is like the Windows insider\npreview program for Windows 10.\n\n398\n00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.270\nDo you want to be on the cutting edge\nreleases, or would you rather wait to\n\n399\n00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:48.760\nreleases are more stable, and there's\nbeen a lot of testing out in the wild.\n\n400\n00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.510\nSo there's different release cycles for\nupdates to Windows.\n\n401\n00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:56.287\nSimilarly, for our old 365 environment,\nwe may wanna be more on the cutting\n\n402\n00:23:56.287 --> 00:24:00.510\nedge of new functionality, or\nwait till it's generally available.\n\n403\n00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:01.465\nSo you have a choice there.\n\n404\n00:24:01.465 --> 00:24:05.555\nMy rule of thumb is, if it's not\na production machine I'm using,\n\n405\n00:24:05.555 --> 00:24:08.710\nI'm okay with more of\nthe experimental upgrades.\n\n406\n00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.260\nBecause I know I'm a guinea pig.\n\n407\n00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.430\nBut if it's a production machine I'm\nusing I can't afford any down time or\n\n408\n00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.260\nI'm going to have to reimage my machine.\n\n409\n00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.560\nI'm okay with waiting a little longer.\n\n410\n00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.310\nSo in the Windows Update\nrealm now there's various\n\n411\n00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:27.060\ntacks available from cutting edge to\nthe long term servicing branch for\n\n412\n00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.870\nair traffic control, hospitals, things you\ndon't want experimenting and having issues\n\n413\n00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:34.300\nwith a patch during operation, or with\ntrying to land a jumbo set for example.\n\n414\n00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:38.030\nSo you've got flexibility in\nhow fast you get your updates.\n\n415\n00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.900\nOkay, let's see now,\n\n416\n00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:44.550\npartner relationships I can specify\nfrom the settings note as well.\n\n417\n00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:45.650\nSo I can add a partner there.\n\n418\n00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:52.680\nAnd let's look at health, so\nI can see service health.\n\n419\n00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:55.970\nWe're all good.\n\n420\n00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:57.810\nVery foxy.\n\n421\n00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:02.890\nSo, now you may not be using all these.\n\n422\n00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:04.345\nI need a mouse again.\n\n423\n00:25:04.345 --> 00:25:08.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All these, online services, but\n\n424\n00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.800\nyou may, at any event, you can see,\nthings like Exchange Online,\n\n425\n00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:17.680\nIdentity Service, are all,\ngood to go, at this point in time.\n\n426\n00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.220\nThere's also a message center there.\n\n427\n00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:27.532\nAnd, a lot of info on what's planned for\n\n428\n00:25:27.532 --> 00:25:32.040\nOffice 365, updated features.\n\n429\n00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:38.700\nSo let's click on that message and\nI can see, okay, what's new.\n\n430\n00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.130\nIn Office 365.\n\n431\n00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.610\nAnd then I can give some,\n\n432\n00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:51.060\nlet me minimize this here,\nI'm screen real estate challenged today.\n\n433\n00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.015\n>> It's a little tough sometimes.\n\n434\n00:25:53.015 --> 00:25:54.080\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I've,\n\n435\n00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.930\nit's like I changed my resolution but\nI really didn't, okay.\n\n436\n00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:04.430\nSo let's do that and\nlet's see this updated feature.\n\n437\n00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:09.449\nAnd okay nothing is so gentle vague Vega\nmessage they're working the Event Center\n\n438\n00:26:09.449 --> 00:26:13.390\nfaster using more efficient and\nthen this is important as well.\n\n439\n00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:17.058\nHow does this affect me what do I need\nto do to prepare for this change so\n\n440\n00:26:17.058 --> 00:26:20.733\nMicrosoft has been fairly criticized\nthe past for making changes and\n\n441\n00:26:20.733 --> 00:26:24.645\nthen optionally telling people that\nthe change was gonna happen later.\n\n442\n00:26:24.645 --> 00:26:28.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In other words make the change,\n\n443\n00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:29.690\nclean up the mess if any.\n\n444\n00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.540\nSo they're getting better now at\nproactively, in various dashboards,\n\n445\n00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.810\nletting you know that\na change is about to occur.\n\n446\n00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:35.430\n>> Nice.\n\n447\n00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.390\n>> So that's our initial look at\nthe admin center, there's a whole bunch\n\n448\n00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:42.050\nof other min consoles we'll\ncover it in another episode.\n\n449\n00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:42.800\n>> Fantastic.\n\n450\n00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.960\nAll right, Mark,\ngreat look at SharePoint online and\n\n451\n00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.060\nintegrating that with Office 365.\n\n452\n00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:52.100\nAnd kind of a preview of all the different\nfeatures and also information about how\n\n453\n00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.660\nyou can get that setup for yourself,\nthe sandbox environment so you can get out\n\n454\n00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:59.100\nthere and play, and more importantly,\nlearn, so you can pass these exams.\n\n455\n00:26:59.100 --> 00:26:59.930\nSo thank you for that, Mark.\n\n456\n00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:00.740\nWe appreciate that.\n\n457\n00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.600\nI hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n458\n00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.050\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n459\n00:27:05.050 -->

00:00:16.454\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:18.986\nToday we're doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:23.178\nSpecifically in this episode, were\ncontinuing on looking at SharePoint online\n\n6\n00:00:23.178 --> 00:00:26.753\nand leaning a little towards\nthe administration side on this one, so\n\n7\n00:00:26.753 --> 00:00:29.110\nhere to help us with that is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n8\n00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.086\nHow's it going Mark?\n\n9\n00:00:30.086 --> 00:00:30.750\n>> Thanks, Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.090\nGreat.\nYeah, we're more than leaning,\n\n11\n00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:32.980\nwe're diving in.\n\n12\n00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.620\n>> All right.\n\n13\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.570\n>> Just like that sink hole I saw\nthe other day in the weekend in\n\n14\n00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.850\nthe Florida swamps.\n\n15\n00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.390\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, man.\n\n16\n00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.300\nGot to watch them.\n\n17\n00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.470\n>> That's true\n>> From afar.\n\n18\n00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.750\nOkay, demo time.\n\n19\n00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.600\nSo, I'm back in my admin center.\n\n20\n00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.630\nNow, if I stretch out or\nexpand the admin centers option,\n\n21\n00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.650\nthen I have various interfaces.\n\n22\n00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.420\nWe're particularly concerned\nwith SharePoint right now,\n\n23\n00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.130\nbecause that's what this episode is about,\nand so, let's go over there.\n\n24\n00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.770\nThis is what it looks\nlike in the admin center.\n\n25\n00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.540\nNow keep in mind,\nMicrosoft is your farm admin.\n\n26\n00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.640\nSo, we get a subset of the settings that\nwe'd have available to us on prem, and\n\n27\n00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.115\nI say hallelujah.\n\n28\n00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:13.460\n[LAUGH] Let someone else handle that.\n\n29\n00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.140\nSo, site collections,\nnotice how we have, again a subset of\n\n30\n00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.880\nthe options we'd have on on prem it's\nactually streamlined and simplified.\n\n31\n00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.530\nMany of these site collections you\nsee on the screen were prepopulated,\n\n32\n00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.850\nwhich is also helpful.\n\n33\n00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.490\nFor example, I chose the demo Acme URL,\n\n34\n00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.820\nat least part of that name space,\nand so I got the portal hub subsite,\n\n35\n00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.410\nthe search subsite, and the catalog.\n\n36\n00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.940\nActually, no,\nI'll create the app catalog later.\n\n37\n00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.730\nI'm getting ahead of myself there.\n\n38\n00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.890\nAll right, so\nthe point is we've got some pre-populated\n\n39\n00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.040\nsite collections to get you started,\nand of course, you can create more.\n\n40\n00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.690\n>> Are site collections\nabout as high as we go?\n\n41\n00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.670\nAnything above that, web applications and\nfarm settings all handled by Microsoft?\n\n42\n00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.310\n>> Exactly.\n\n43\n00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.800\n>> Gotcha.\n>> Exactly.\n\n44\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.030\nSo, I can click on new here,\ncreate a new site collection,\n\n45\n00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.620\nbefore I do that we have\nresources available.\n\n46\n00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.460\nNow, you might think 5,000 resources,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n47\n00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.860\nWell, it's some basket if you like of\n\n48\n00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.980\nmeasures that combine into\nlayman's terms of resources.\n\n49\n00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.680\nSo, we don't concern ourselves with those.\n\n50\n00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.260\nSo, we got roughly a terabyte available,\nand let's say I need to buy more storage.\n\n51\n00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.170\nWell, Microsoft is having to\nsell you more of everything.\n\n52\n00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.520\nI need to re-authenticate for that,\nI'm gonna click on the keep me signed in,\n\n53\n00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.048\nwhich doesn't always work frankly but\na man can hope.\n\n54\n00:02:37.048 --> 00:02:41.250\n[LAUGH] And it's not a big deal actually\nto re-authenticate occasionally,\n\n55\n00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.770\nI'm not complaining that much.\n\n56\n00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.580\nWhen I forget my password,\nthat's when I get upset.\n\n57\n00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.280\nAll right.\nThe white screen of life again.\n\n58\n00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.090\nNow I can purchase as an admin.\n\n59\n00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.100\nAgain, there's at this point 25 users.\n\n60\n00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.000\nI can add x dollars per user per month.\n\n61\n00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.660\nThere's more actions here.\n\n62\n00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.820\nMight want to specify a partner of record,\neven cancel a trial, heaven forbid.\n\n63\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:13.460\nOkay, and there is also\nthe user purchases section, and\n\n64\n00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.612\nthere is a link there to learn\nmore about user purchases.\n\n65\n00:03:16.612 --> 00:03:18.590\nWhich I'm not going to\nworry about right now.\n\n66\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.450\nAll right, because we're more\nconcerned with the admin aspects.\n\n67\n00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.850\nSo, I'll back up to where I was,\none more time.\n\n68\n00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.460\nAll right, so\nthat's how we combine more storage, and\n\n69\n00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.920\nlet's create a new\nprivate site collection.\n\n70\n00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.025\nSo, that word private you might not\nhave seen before, but it's reassuring.\n\n71\n00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:41.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not going to be exposed to\n\n72\n00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.670\neveryone in internet land.\n\n73\n00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.750\nSo, we have to give it a title.\n\n74\n00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.090\nLet's call it Florida,\nsince that's where we are,\n\n75\n00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.624\nand website address here I can choose,\nso in terms of manage paths\n\n76\n00:03:54.624 --> 00:03:59.850\nour options here we have slash site and\nslash teams document slash sites,\n\n77\n00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.220\nand smaller is better when it comes to\nurl length, it's just easier to parse and\n\n78\n00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.950\nyou might bump up against maximum\ncharacter limits in the url.\n\n79\n00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.920\nSo people, It's just easier for humans\nto understand and look at a smaller url.\n\n80\n00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.840\nDon't get silly like just use one\nletter or anything or two letters,\n\n81\n00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.500\nbut don't go excessively either.\n\n82\n00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.710\nLanguage options here Estonian,\nthere's no Albonian option,\n\n83\n00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.358\nthose of you Gilbert fans out\nthere will know about Albonia.\n\n84\n00:04:31.358 --> 00:04:33.858\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay,\n\n85\n00:04:33.858 --> 00:04:36.570\nand we never looked at this before so\nlet's look at it now.\n\n86\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.210\nVarious site templates, these are\npre-populated, we can always customize and\n\n87\n00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.610\ncreate our own.\n\n88\n00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.850\nEnterprise options here, Some of these\nwe'll cover it in the Advanced SharePoint\n\n89\n00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:53.390\ncourse, for example eDiscovery for illegal\nanalysis of resources like emails and\n\n90\n00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.480\nshared documents, records Center,\nthere is a Business Intelligence Center.\n\n91\n00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.015\nSo again, these are advanced topics.\n\n92\n00:05:01.015 --> 00:05:05.390\nThere's also Publishing templates for\na publishing portal, Enterprise wiki.\n\n93\n00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.620\nIn the history of share point,\nthe portal was actually part of name.\n\n94\n00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.670\nSo, it was a much bigger deal.\n\n95\n00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.320\nEverything flowed from the portal.\n\n96\n00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.790\nNow, the last few versions, portal's just\nanother site template you can choose, or\n\n97\n00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.220\nnot even use at all,\nif you didn't want to.\n\n98\n00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.020\nAnd then any custom templates,\nagain we could copy an existing template,\n\n99\n00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.190\nmake some changes, save it as your own, or\nstart from scratch with a blank page and\n\n100\n00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.640\nadd web parts and\nsave them as a custom template.\n\n101\n00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.970\nBut to keep it simple,\nI'll just keep it on team site.\n\n102\n00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.215\nAnd actually I'm feeling bold,\nlet's go to Project Site.\n\n103\n00:05:32.215 --> 00:05:35.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And if you forget exactly what\n\n104\n00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.700\na site is for, then a helpful description\nat the bottom in case you forget there.\n\n105\n00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.880\nSo, a site for managing and\ncollaborating on a project.\n\n106\n00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.258\nSome of them are more obvious than others.\n\n107\n00:05:44.258 --> 00:05:47.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Timezone is good.\n\n108\n00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.331\nIll leave it a Pacific time, and\nthen the administrator will be me,\n\n109\n00:05:54.331 --> 00:05:55.860\nunderlines there.\n\n110\n00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.650\nAnd then again this nebulous resources,\ndont worry about the measure it's going to\n\n111\n00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:07.000\nuse, we're going to allocate 300 of\n5000 resources to this site collection.\n\n112\n00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.230\nill hit okay, and okay,\nso this is useful here.\n\n113\n00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.740\nIt says, your site collection is being\ncreated it can take 15 minutes or longer.\n\n114\n00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.970\nSo often, when were doing Cloud\nactivities its the kind of thing where,\n\n115\n00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.410\ndont expect instant gratification.\n\n116\n00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.230\nGratification like you might on prem.\n\n117\n00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.570\nSometimes you just got to go for launch\nand trust that the site will get created,\n\n118\n00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.870\nor what has happened to me recently\nwhen it's creating an app catalog, for\n\n119\n00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.800\nexample it looked like\nthe site was broken.\n\n120\n00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.630\nI kept getting broken links and\n\n121\n00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.000\nthen I realized it's just Microsoft doing\nits thing I'm not going to worry about it.\n\n122\n00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.800\nI'm not going to start a support ticket or\nstart Googling.\n\n123\n00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.750\nI'll just trust that the site's\nbeing created, there's functionality\n\n124\n00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.380\nto be added, and sure enough minutes\nlater it was working as expected.\n\n125\n00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.520\nSo don't panic, you will get errors or\nthings won't appear to be\n\n126\n00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.840\ndoing what you expect them to do, but\nyou know there's millions of customers.\n\n127\n00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.330\nThere's a lot of terabytes,\n\n128\n00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.760\nexabytes of information to be managed so\na little patience Is in order.\n\n129\n00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:09.070\nNow we have, notice that we have\nthe new icon next to the catalog site.\n\n130\n00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:16.550\nI created that recently, so the amount of\ntime that the new icon stays up varies.\n\n131\n00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.440\nProbably if you've worked with\nother versions of SharePoint,\n\n132\n00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.780\nyou're used to seeing that new,\nI don't know that it's easily tweakabale.\n\n133\n00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.440\nFor example, you might want the new to\nappear for a week, and then disappear.\n\n134\n00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.480\nIt's not that easy.\n\n135\n00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.330\nThere's no kind of GUI way to adjust that.\n\n136\n00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.040\nBut no worries.\n\n137\n00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.600\nNow, more importantly for this demo,\nsee, the Florida site is created.\n\n138\n00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.510\nIt had a little circle going around, those\nlittle dots, and it's just been created.\n\n139\n00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.700\nSo that took less than a minute,\nand we've got the new icon there.\n\n140\n00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.060\nGonna click down to that, and this doesn't\nopen the site collection like you might\n\n141\n00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.100\nexpect, what it does do is open\nthe site collection properties.\n\n142\n00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.197\nSo, and then there's a link to the site,\nwhich I can get to by clicking on it,\n\n143\n00:07:54.197 --> 00:07:55.656\nshows the administrator.\n\n144\n00:07:55.656 --> 00:07:59.389\nNow this is useful, typically for if we\nhave established a quota which we have,\n\n145\n00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:02.639\nyou'll need definitely want to\nhave quotas for everything online.\n\n146\n00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:04.575\nWhy, because you're paying for everything.\n\n147\n00:08:04.575 --> 00:08:06.525\nSo it goes for Azure as well.\n\n148\n00:08:06.525 --> 00:08:11.340\nSo you pay for\nexactly what you use when you use it.\n\n149\n00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.824\nSo if you're not sure,\nshut down the resource.\n\n150\n00:08:14.824 --> 00:08:15.960\nt's better now.\n\n151\n00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.245\nIt used to be,\njust like with old cellphones,\n\n152\n00:08:18.245 --> 00:08:22.105\nnow a lot of carriers will send you a text\nmessage when you're close to quota.\n\n153\n00:08:22.105 --> 00:08:25.085\nIn the old days, I mean, I am\nembarrassed to admit, I had four-figure\n\n154\n00:08:25.085 --> 00:08:28.015\nmonthly bills occasionally when\ntraveling to Europe because I foolishly,\n\n155\n00:08:28.015 --> 00:08:30.965\nI should have just not taken the phone or\nbought a plan in Europe.\n\n156\n00:08:30.965 --> 00:08:32.025\nBut no, I had to have it on.\n\n157\n00:08:32.025 --> 00:08:35.580\nAnd then got majorly\nzinged returning home.\n\n158\n00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.330\nSo now, with Microsoft, they're much\nbetter about notifying you, hey,\n\n159\n00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.370\nyou've just spent x hundred dollars.\n\n160\n00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.070\nSo then you can either choose\nto shut down the service or\n\n161\n00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.720\nmaybe pay for more resources.\n\n162\n00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.690\nBut in terms of quotas for\nsite collections, again, it's not,\n\n163\n00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:57.730\nyou might be more forgiving or less likely\nto implement quotas on-prem because you've\n\n164\n00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.160\ngot lots of cheap storage available.\n\n165\n00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.070\nAlthough, that's not\na best practice either.\n\n166\n00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.320\nYou should always have some kind of quota.\n\n167\n00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.150\nPoint is, though,\n\n168\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.680\nyou'd want to send out a resource usage\nwarning level, typically 75% of maximum.\n\n169\n00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.460\nSo, I'm gonna click on\nthe site collection link now.\n\n170\n00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.660\nAnd again the white screen.\n\n171\n00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.150\nHave to imagine angels singing now,\nand voila.\n\n172\n00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.170\nSo, I created a project site template.\n\n173\n00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.040\nSo, as you'd expect,\n\n174\n00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.555\nthey're web parts pertaining to project,\nincluding a timeline.\n\n175\n00:09:26.555 --> 00:09:27.930\n>> Nice.\n\n176\n00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.000\n>> Now, here's the get started.\n\n177\n00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.920\nSo, again, really user friendly.\n\n178\n00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.590\nIf you know nothing about SharePoint and\nyou were confronted with this\n\n179\n00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.900\nas an end user,\nit's probably not gonna freak you out.\n\n180\n00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.344\nOr if it does call helpdesk.\n\n181\n00:09:41.344 --> 00:09:43.115\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so\n\n182\n00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:45.790\nit may be because I'm more\nfamiliar with SharePoint.\n\n183\n00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:52.909\nI don't need these kind of prompts or\nreminders, so I can choose to remove this.\n\n184\n00:09:52.909 --> 00:09:57.350\nNow, if I do, though, I have to be,\nnot just be selfish for me, but\n\n185\n00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.930\nthink about all the users\nof this site collection.\n\n186\n00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.620\nSo there's a warning that, this will\nremove getting started for everyone.\n\n187\n00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.410\nSo I'll change my mind, I'll cancel out\nof that because there might be some\n\n188\n00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:09.240\nnewbies that would really\nbenefit from that hand holding.\n\n189\n00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.590\nAnd various web parts that you\nwould see with team sites.\n\n190\n00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.820\nSo I can add tasks.\n\n191\n00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.690\nSo I click right on the timeline and\nthen there's tasks to add there.\n\n192\n00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.070\nSo, but again,\nthis isn't an end user course.\n\n193\n00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.815\nI'm just showing you the process of\nhow to access a site collection.\n\n194\n00:10:22.815 --> 00:10:26.070\nI'll close out of that and\ngo back to my admin console now.\n\n195\n00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.850\nThere's a recycle bin, which is useful.\n\n196\n00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.900\nLet's see what happens if I,\nthere's nothing in that.\n\n197\n00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.080\nSite collection now.\n\n198\n00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:37.510\nIn the recycle bin, rather.\n\n199\n00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.746\nSo what happens if I delete that\nFlorida site I just created?\n\n200\n00:10:43.746 --> 00:10:47.671\nSite collection.\n\n201\n00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:52.020\nOkay, now, this saves me from myself,\npotentially.\n\n202\n00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.030\nIf I inadvertently, we've all done this,\nwe've had in mind, okay,\n\n203\n00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:59.220\nI want to delete this object, but\nthen inadvertently deleted another object.\n\n204\n00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:04.450\nAnd if you're tired, say, or you're just\ndistracted by the basketball playoffs or\n\n205\n00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:08.370\nwhat have you, you might click the wrong\nbutton or maybe your mouse moved.\n\n206\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.190\nAnd so, it just saves you from\nyourself because the default is\n\n207\n00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.540\nto save data site collections for 30 days.\n\n208\n00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:21.250\nNow, on-prem you may have enabled two\nstage recycle bin, which means, let's\n\n209\n00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:25.580\nsay I delete something from my site, and\nI'm not a site collection administrator,\n\n210\n00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.780\nI could call up my site collection\nadministrator, who would have a second\n\n211\n00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:33.010\nstage recycle bin for all the sites and\ncontent within that site collection.\n\n212\n00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.180\nAnd, again, the site collection\nadministrator looks like a hero because\n\n213\n00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.860\nthey're able to restore some content\nthat you thought was lost forever or\n\n214\n00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:44.430\nthat would require a time\nconsuming restore.\n\n215\n00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.290\nAnd if you've ever done a single\nitem restore of a file or\n\n216\n00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.430\nan e-mail, it is a hassle.\n\n217\n00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.200\nSo this is very user friendly.\n\n218\n00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.620\nSo, however,\nthere's no two stage recycle bin online.\n\n219\n00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.986\nIt's a one stage recycle bin,\n30 days by default.\n\n220\n00:11:56.986 --> 00:12:00.390\nAnd okay, so,\nI'm going to go ahead and say,\n\n221\n00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:05.390\nyes, delete,\nthrowing caution to the wind at ITPro.\n\n222\n00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.290\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\n223\n00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.570\n>> We love to live on the edge.\n\n224\n00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.083\n>> That's right.\n\n225\n00:12:10.083 --> 00:12:12.410\nLiving la vida loca.\n\n226\n00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.556\nOkay, so that is gone.\n\n227\n00:12:13.556 --> 00:12:14.952\nNow go to the recycle bin.\n\n228\n00:12:17.437 --> 00:12:22.099\nAnd there, the item is populated, so\n\n229\n00:12:22.099 --> 00:12:28.089\nI can select all and\nthen restore deleted items.\n\n230\n00:12:28.089 --> 00:12:29.971\nHallelujah.\n\n231\n00:12:29.971 --> 00:12:32.360\n>> And we're back in business.\n\n232\n00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:32.860\n>> Exactly.\n\n233\n00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.165\n>> And\nI don't have to update my resume [LAUGH].\n\n234\n00:12:35.165 --> 00:12:36.960\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n235\n00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.870\nWe want to avoid those RPEs.\n\n236\n00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:40.580\nAll right.\n\n237\n00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.740\nNow, info path is a whole\nother conversation.\n\n238\n00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.925\nJust suffice to say that there is,\nyou can use your info path 13\n\n239\n00:12:49.925 --> 00:12:55.130\nin SharePoint 2016 or\nSharePoint Online environment.\n\n240\n00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:59.036\nHowever, there's no plans to\nupgrade the infopath 2013 client.\n\n241\n00:12:59.036 --> 00:13:02.080\nSo, that's all I'll say about that.\n\n242\n00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.870\nBut Infopath, you might have used it.\n\n243\n00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.340\nIt's great for creating forms.\n\n244\n00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:09.310\nAnd anytime you can move a paper based\nprocess into some kind of online form,\n\n245\n00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:10.350\nI say go for it.\n\n246\n00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:16.996\nOkay.\nUser profiles is another section.\n\n247\n00:13:19.527 --> 00:13:20.320\nAll right.\n\n248\n00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:26.010\nSo, let's look at what's possible\nin terms of user profiles.\n\n249\n00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:30.050\nSo, again,\na subset of the options available on-prem.\n\n250\n00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:32.430\nI can click on manage user properties.\n\n251\n00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:40.320\nSo, these are properties that can\nbe captured relating to a user.\n\n252\n00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.390\nYou can think of this as metadata.\n\n253\n00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:48.160\nSo, items or information about\npeople in one organization\n\n254\n00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.180\nmight be totally irrelevant in another.\n\n255\n00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.280\nPlus, you can customize your properties.\n\n256\n00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.390\nSo, for example, you might have some kind\nof unique ID number to classify employees,\n\n257\n00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:02.180\nor their geography or their rank, or\nthe level of their secret clearance, for\n\n258\n00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:02.820\nexample.\n\n259\n00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.470\nSo, there's support for a lot of built\nin properties and any customization.\n\n260\n00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.370\nSo, things you're used to seeing.\n\n261\n00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.240\nMany of these you're used to seeing\nin an active directory environment.\n\n262\n00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.265\nOther properties are unique to SharePoint.\n\n263\n00:14:16.265 --> 00:14:17.290\nSo, picture, for example.\n\n264\n00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.020\nWe don't see that in Active Directory.\n\n265\n00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.100\nAsk Me About.\n\n266\n00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.356\nSo, with the advent of social and\nsharing, so much information about how to\n\n267\n00:14:26.356 --> 00:14:30.860\nsuccessfully run an organization does\nnot live anywhere that's searchable.\n\n268\n00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.570\nIn another words, there's no\npolicy manual, there's no document\n\n269\n00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:37.140\nwith a lot of the information that's\ncritical to running the company.\n\n270\n00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.620\nThat's why that we often joke about,\n\n271\n00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.280\nit's kind of macabre, we joke about\nwhat if someone gets hit by a bus.\n\n272\n00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.318\nWill the company die?\n\n273\n00:14:43.318 --> 00:14:46.091\nHopefully not.\n\n274\n00:14:46.091 --> 00:14:51.150\nSo, by including these extra properties\nMicrosoft is attempting to make\n\n275\n00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.210\nmore available that lives\nonly in people's brains\n\n276\n00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:55.740\nto other people in the organization.\n\n277\n00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.990\nSo, for example, peers, the ask me about.\n\n278\n00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.590\nSo, I might have a certain\narea of expertise.\n\n279\n00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:02.160\nI'm not bragging.\n\n280\n00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.015\nI'm just saying this could be\nuseful to the organization.\n\n281\n00:15:04.015 --> 00:15:07.040\nI've put on this conference\nmaybe three years ago, but\n\n282\n00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.290\nI know a lot about putting on conferences,\ngetting speakers, etc.\n\n283\n00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.080\nSo you can ask me about\nputting on conferences.\n\n284\n00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:17.980\nAnd a new employee might have no idea\nthat the task they've been charged with,\n\n285\n00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.920\nputting on a conference, someone in\nthe organization has recently done.\n\n286\n00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.390\nSo they can save a lot of time.\n\n287\n00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.780\nThe problem is, with information\nliving in people's heads and\n\n288\n00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:30.370\nnot documented anywhere, is there's\na lot of duplication and time wasting.\n\n289\n00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.090\nAnd someone might say,\nif I'd only known that so and so\n\n290\n00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.109\nwas involved in this,\nthat would have saved me a lot of time.\n\n291\n00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:38.230\nHire date is,\n\n292\n00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.830\nthat's again another example of field\nyou don't get in active directory.\n\n293\n00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:49.400\nAnd contact information there, birthday,\nskills, schools, interests, past projects.\n\n294\n00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.442\nAgain, a way of letting people\nknow about who you are and\n\n295\n00:15:53.442 --> 00:15:57.830\nhow resourceful you can be for\nothers in your organization.\n\n296\n00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.183\nIt works both ways, of course.\n\n297\n00:15:59.183 --> 00:16:02.433\nThe more people share about themselves and\nmake available their expertise,\n\n298\n00:16:02.433 --> 00:16:03.784\nthe better it is for everybody.\n\n299\n00:16:03.784 --> 00:16:08.101\nBut typically, there's going to be\ngivers and takers, so I might expose,\n\n300\n00:16:08.101 --> 00:16:11.677\nI can do this, I'm conversant\nin this programming language,\n\n301\n00:16:11.677 --> 00:16:15.260\nI've set up these websites,\nthese projects I've worked on.\n\n302\n00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.620\nWhereas, someone else might not expose\nany of that information about themself\n\n303\n00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.790\nbecause they don't wanna be bugged.\n\n304\n00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:24.120\nThey just wanna code in the back room or\nsomething.\n\n305\n00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.445\nDon't talk to me, I'll just code.\n\n306\n00:16:25.445 --> 00:16:28.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was a stereotype I know but\n\n307\n00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:29.730\nstereotypes exist for a reason.\n\n308\n00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:30.425\n>> That's right.\n\n309\n00:16:30.425 --> 00:16:34.750\n>> It's just like with fax machines\nback in the day, or video phones or\n\n310\n00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.840\nvideo conferencing, the more people\nthat have it in your organization,\n\n311\n00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.549\nthere's an exponential\neffect in terms of benefit.\n\n312\n00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:47.390\nI can choose which activities I want to\nshare my news feed, language information,\n\n313\n00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.790\nso again,\nthese are customizable properties.\n\n314\n00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.828\nLet's go back here, user\n\n315\n00:16:55.828 --> 00:17:01.210\nprofiles, I\n\n316\n00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:06.220\ncan import profiles from active directory,\nand I could set up synchronization.\n\n317\n00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.130\n>> That's nice.\n\n318\n00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:10.930\n>> Very cool.\nAudiences,\n\n319\n00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:12.860\naudiences are often misunderstood.\n\n320\n00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.210\nAudiences don't have anything\nto do with security.\n\n321\n00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:21.880\nWhat they do have to do with is what\ninformation gets exposed to which people.\n\n322\n00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.090\nFor example, let's say I have\na company intranet page and\n\n323\n00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:29.160\nmy company offices are in\nfour different cities.\n\n324\n00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.470\nOne section of that Intranet\nhome page could be for\n\n325\n00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:33.870\nstrictly regional information.\n\n326\n00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:39.510\nIf you have four users, one each from the\ndifferent cities in which the organization\n\n327\n00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:43.120\noperates, there each gonna see a slightly\ndifferent version of the exact same page.\n\n328\n00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.590\nHow do we do that?\n\n329\n00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.660\nThrough audience targeting.\n\n330\n00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.470\nWhat makes up an audience?\n\n331\n00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:52.490\nWhatever fields you want\nto choose to use to target.\n\n332\n00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.330\nThat can be based on,\nI'll give an example,\n\n333\n00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:58.755\ngeography cane be based\non organizational role.\n\n334\n00:17:58.755 --> 00:18:03.400\nVPs, for example,\nmight get certain KPIs on headcount or\n\n335\n00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:07.190\nsome key metric that should be kept\nsecret from others in the organization.\n\n336\n00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:11.380\nAn audience can be defined by any field or\ncombination of fields that you can dream\n\n337\n00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.560\nup to expose certain content to users but\nnot others.\n\n338\n00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.899\nThe reason why I say audiences are\nmisunderstood is audiences have nothing to\n\n339\n00:18:18.899 --> 00:18:20.172\ndo with security.\n\n340\n00:18:20.172 --> 00:18:25.710\nSecuring an object, and restricting\nthe visibility is a different step\n\n341\n00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.300\ncompared to targeting\ncontent via audiences.\n\n342\n00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:37.048\nIf I wanna click a new audience,\nI specify new audience, give it a name.\n\n343\n00:18:37.048 --> 00:18:41.600\nIn terms of audience makeup,\nI can say that\n\n344\n00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.970\nI can have different rules as to\nwho should comprise an audience.\n\n345\n00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.770\nAnd I could say any one of these\nrules if they're satisfied,\n\n346\n00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:53.080\nthat makes the person the member of an\naudience or I could say, all of the rules.\n\n347\n00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:58.440\nFor example, maybe it's managers\nat one specific office location.\n\n348\n00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.370\nSo that would be two separate rules and\nwe say the audience has to be,\n\n349\n00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.860\nyou have to manager, and you have to be at\nthis location, head office location, for\n\n350\n00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.770\nexample, or\nelse you're not part of this audience.\n\n351\n00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.380\nAnd you can have any number of rules\nto define audience that you want.\n\n352\n00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.911\n>> That's nice.\n\n353\n00:19:16.384 --> 00:19:17.510\n>> Let's go back here.\n\n354\n00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.640\nUser permissions is another section here.\n\n355\n00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.350\nWorking it.\n\n356\n00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:30.000\nThis is, for example,\nwho can create my sites.\n\n357\n00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.893\nMy Sites, a polarizing concept, some\norganizations that's one of the primary\n\n358\n00:19:33.893 --> 00:19:35.906\ndrivers for their share point adoption.\n\n359\n00:19:35.906 --> 00:19:39.975\nMy Sites, which is basically granting\nthe people the ability to create your own\n\n360\n00:19:39.975 --> 00:19:43.559\npersonal site collections,\nbe master of their own site collection,\n\n361\n00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:47.750\nchoose what to share, what information to\nexpose, make it a little workspace for\n\n362\n00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.470\nthem only if they want.\n\n363\n00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.840\nOther organizations, that concept\nterrifies them because they lack\n\n364\n00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:56.140\ntotal control then about\nthe kinds of content, and\n\n365\n00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:01.640\nthe kinds of sharing of content\nin the individual user's\n\n366\n00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.250\nMy Sites, which again,\nis their own personal site collection.\n\n367\n00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.160\nWith this section here, this permissions,\n\n368\n00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.620\nI can just alter who\ngets to create My Sites.\n\n369\n00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:15.890\nMaybe I wanna roll out My Sites just\nto one department or one city of users,\n\n370\n00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:19.530\njust to test it out before\ndeploying it organization wide.\n\n371\n00:20:22.937 --> 00:20:28.550\nManage policies is the next section here.\n\n372\n00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:33.030\nBecause we got this item in red here,\n\n373\n00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:36.210\nthe make My Sites public\nfeature is enabled and\n\n374\n00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.540\ntherefore, people on My Site and policy\nunder privacy settings are being ignored.\n\n375\n00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.680\nIn other words, these policy settings\nare coming from another place.\n\n376\n00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.620\nWe can say for people sending at My Site,\n\n377\n00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:52.930\nthere's certain fields that are mandatory\nand others that are optional.\n\n378\n00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:59.200\nAnother great thing about My Sites\nis user have the ability to share or\n\n379\n00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.210\nnot share whatever information\nabout themselves they want.\n\n380\n00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.690\nThe example I always like to use is maybe\nif I have a home phone, I haven't had one\n\n381\n00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:11.210\nfor 20 years, but if I had one,\nmaybe I only want my manager to know that.\n\n382\n00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:14.470\nIt appears on my My Sites profile but\nthere's only two people that can see it,\n\n383\n00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:16.350\nme and my manager.\n\n384\n00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:20.900\nOther information,\nthere is another category of sharing for\n\n385\n00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:25.005\ncolleagues, so people I interact\nwith maybe at the same job title,\n\n386\n00:21:25.005 --> 00:21:28.835\nmaybe we're in the same work group or\nteam at work, or work on the same project.\n\n387\n00:21:28.835 --> 00:21:33.335\nI can define them as colleagues and that's\nanother layer of content I can expose.\n\n388\n00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:37.145\nThere's also the everyone, so\ncertain content, my hobbies,\n\n389\n00:21:37.145 --> 00:21:42.030\nmy album matter, I don't mind and\nin fact, I want everyone to know.\n\n390\n00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:46.996\nJust like you've found with other\nsocial profiles, Facebook, LinkedIn,\n\n391\n00:21:46.996 --> 00:21:53.630\nyou get really micro-control over\nwho gets to see what content.\n\n392\n00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:02.290\nThe organizational properties\nwe can manage as well.\n\n393\n00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:05.230\nThese are related to\nthe organization as a whole.\n\n394\n00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:13.350\nAbout Us doesn't refer to a person\nit refers to the organization.\n\n395\n00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.473\nMaybe the organization was called\nsomething else,people love to rebrand ot\n\n396\n00:22:16.473 --> 00:22:18.498\nmaybe they got acquired or\nyou were the acquirer.\n\n397\n00:22:18.498 --> 00:22:19.787\nYou can add logo information.\n\n398\n00:22:24.206 --> 00:22:29.309\nOrganization profiles I can specify\n\n399\n00:22:29.309 --> 00:22:34.110\nan organization profile and have a user\nprofile service information for that.\n\n400\n00:22:37.355 --> 00:22:41.790\nLet's go to the My Site settings, so\nthat again, they're been vilified or not,\n\n401\n00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.240\nkind a like of Kobe, I guess.\n\n402\n00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:48.340\nLove or hate him, he's still got his\nhaters and he celebrates his haters.\n\n403\n00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:55.732\nPreferred search center, when users\nare searching from their My Site,\n\n404\n00:22:55.732 --> 00:22:59.740\nwe can have different search centers.\n\n405\n00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.740\nThis is more important if we have a global\norganization with different languages and\n\n406\n00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.330\ndifferent regions.\n\n407\n00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:09.430\nTypically, EMEA is one region,\nthat's Europe, Middle East, and Africa.\n\n408\n00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.690\nThey might use a different search\ncenter than North American users or\n\n409\n00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:13.920\nSouth American users.\n\n410\n00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.180\nIt would be optimized for\nlanguage settings or\n\n411\n00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:21.370\nmaybe multi-language settings, in\nthe case of Europe, it just makes sense,\n\n412\n00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:24.240\nrather than one global search center for\neverybody.\n\n413\n00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.670\nIt makes sense administratively in terms\nof the manual tweaking required for\n\n414\n00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:30.758\nsearch, to have separate search centers or\nat least the option.\n\n415\n00:23:30.758 --> 00:23:34.990\nSimilarly, My Sites, again,\nthese are entire site collections, so\n\n416\n00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.530\ndo you want all the My Sites\nhosted a one place for the world?\n\n417\n00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:43.438\nProbably not, if you are that big and\nagain, you're gonna have continental or\n\n418\n00:23:43.438 --> 00:23:48.582\ncountry divisions, so different places\nwhere the hosts are physically located.\n\n419\n00:23:48.582 --> 00:23:56.547\nAlso, we could specify a personal site\nlocation in terms of URL path here and\n\n420\n00:23:56.547 --> 00:24:00.663\nthen a site naming format for my sites.\n\n421\n00:24:00.663 --> 00:24:02.174\nNow, this section here,\n\n422\n00:24:02.174 --> 00:24:07.052\nthe site naming format is important if you\nhave a multi-domain environment because\n\n423\n00:24:07.052 --> 00:24:11.810\nif we're creating a new user account in\na domain, it must be unique in the domain.\n\n424\n00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:16.970\nYou could have a John Smith, you probably\ndo, in your North American domain,\n\n425\n00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.710\nand another John Smith\nin your European domain.\n\n426\n00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:25.540\nSo how are those site naming, how do we\nhandle conflicting information there?\n\n427\n00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:30.110\nThe best way to do it is to use\na combination of domain name and user name\n\n428\n00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:34.760\nthat would be unique because within each\ndomain there can be only one John Smith.\n\n429\n00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.813\nThere might be a J Smith or\na John Smith one, but only one John Smith.\n\n430\n00:24:39.764 --> 00:24:41.660\nOkay, and then permission level.\n\n431\n00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.550\nThe default is read for personal sites.\n\n432\n00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.660\nAnd then, do we want activities\non my site news feeds?\n\n433\n00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:52.330\nSo this is, in other words,\n\n434\n00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.370\nhow much do you wanna be distracted\nis another way of looking at it.\n\n435\n00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:58.200\nDo you wanna know about birthdays or\nwork anniversaries?\n\n436\n00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.110\nI know at Microsoft you get\na pound of chocolate or\n\n437\n00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:06.150\npound of candy on your desk for every\nyear that you've been employed there.\n\n438\n00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:06.870\n>> Really?\n\n439\n00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:10.120\n>> So, if you're into that kinda thing.\n\n440\n00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.781\nSo, do you wanna know about when\nsomeone's change their job title?\n\n441\n00:25:13.781 --> 00:25:17.450\nSocial tagging of contents, so\nyou can tag content in SharePoint.\n\n442\n00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:20.159\nYou can rate with a star rating.\n\n443\n00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:27.430\nSo a lot of what we're doing in life\nnowadays is managing the overflow of data.\n\n444\n00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:30.040\nSo data comes to us that we want to see,\n\n445\n00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.775\nnot irrelevant stuff like\ncandy crush game requests.\n\n446\n00:25:32.775 --> 00:25:33.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n447\n00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.360\nif my colleague now has a new title,\nand now my colleague is my boss,\n\n448\n00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.350\nmy former colleague is my boss,\nI wanna know about that.\n\n449\n00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.869\n>> Yeah.\n>> And\n\n450\n00:25:39.869 --> 00:25:41.545\nI'm okay with finding that\nout in the news feed.\n\n451\n00:25:41.545 --> 00:25:45.402\n>> And then, email addresses.\n\n452\n00:25:45.402 --> 00:25:48.220\nSo, this is useful.\n\n453\n00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.010\nSo let's say, as a Microsoft trainer,\n\n454\n00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:53.530\nI participate in the Microsoft\ntrainer newsgroup.\n\n455\n00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:58.840\nI don't have time to scroll through\ndozens of conversations in the off-chance\n\n456\n00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.400\nthat a conversation I'm interested in,\nsomeone has posted a reply to.\n\n457\n00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.480\nSo, I can get that\ninformation coming to me.\n\n458\n00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.320\nI can be emailed when someone has added\n\n459\n00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.590\na comment to a conversation\nI'm interested in.\n\n460\n00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:13.424\nSo, there's where you can allow\nnews feed email notifications.\n\n461\n00:26:13.424 --> 00:26:18.860\nAnd then,\nlet's say user a leaves the organization.\n\n462\n00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.250\nDefault is to retain the my\nsite information for 30 days.\n\n463\n00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.740\nMaybe the new person in that job might be\nable to utilize some of that content or\n\n464\n00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.180\nnot, so you've got 30 days to access.\n\n465\n00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:33.760\nNow, I always advocate for, let's say\nwhen you're creating new site collection,\n\n466\n00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.715\nmight wanna specify a secondary\nsite collection administrator.\n\n467\n00:26:37.715 --> 00:26:41.470\nSimilarly, you might want a secondary\nowner for my site content\n\n468\n00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:45.370\nto make it easier to access that content\nwhen somebody leaves your organization.\n\n469\n00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:48.920\nSo, therefore, you don't have to\nworry about getting permissions or\n\n470\n00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.440\noverriding permissions, etc.\n\n471\n00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:56.090\nThe secondary owner has full access to\nthat former employee's My Site content.\n\n472\n00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:58.570\nThe secondary admin.\n\n473\n00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.050\nAnd then, privacy settings.\n\n474\n00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:03.954\nShould my sites be public by default or\nprivate by default?\n\n475\n00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:07.096\nOkay.\n\n476\n00:27:07.096 --> 00:27:08.769\nLet's go back here.\n\n477\n00:27:10.603 --> 00:27:12.600\nAnd trusted host locations.\n\n478\n00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.280\nSo that's, again, if you have\nmultiple locations because you've\n\n479\n00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.180\ngot a geographically dispersed\nenvironment, so that would make sense.\n\n480\n00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:21.919\nManaging promoted sites.\n\n481\n00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:29.040\nOkay, so even though My Sites are, it's\n\n482\n00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:33.090\nmanageable to use its own site collection,\nwe can still infiltrate through My Sites.\n\n483\n00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.520\nWe can get corporate information.\n\n484\n00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.510\nWe can slide it in there.\n\n485\n00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.930\nAnd how we do that is by\nusing Promoted Sites.\n\n486\n00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:45.380\nSo, this way, a user's My Sites web part,\nthese promoted sites will appear there.\n\n487\n00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:50.086\nSo that could be updated product catalog,\nfor example, or company road map for\n\n488\n00:27:50.086 --> 00:27:51.900\na fiscal year 2000 xx.\n\n489\n00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:56.220\nSo that's a good way of getting content.\n\n490\n00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.360\nIt's very easy, right?\n\n491\n00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.590\nYou're making one settings change here,\nand\n\n492\n00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:02.610\nit goes into potentially\nthousands of users My Sites.\n\n493\n00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.870\nThat's powerful.\n\n494\n00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:07.010\nThere's nothing to script,\nanything like that.\n\n495\n00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:10.740\nA couple more things for this module,\nfor this episode, rather.\n\n496\n00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.750\nPublish links to Office applications.\n\n497\n00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:15.118\nSo, one of the big complaints users have,\nand rightfully so,\n\n498\n00:28:15.118 --> 00:28:18.130\nif they're used to saving content into\nfile share, now we're asking them to save\n\n499\n00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:21.615\nin the SharePoint context, and there's\nall these extra clicks, forget about it.\n\n500\n00:28:21.615 --> 00:28:23.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n501\n00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:27.350\npeople are used to using the Save As\ndialog box from, say, Word.\n\n502\n00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:32.120\n>> What if we could have links to\nSharePoint sites, document libraries, for\n\n503\n00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.430\nexample, so that when they go to Save As,\nboom, they just click on,\n\n504\n00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.400\nand there's a super long URL potentially.\n\n505\n00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.030\nBut they don't have to type that all in.\n\n506\n00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:42.300\nThey just select that link and then they\nsave the document, give it a name, and\n\n507\n00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.920\nthen it goes into that document\nlibrary automatically.\n\n508\n00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.280\n>> Well, that's fantastic there.\n\n509\n00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.910\n>> Now, you can also publish\nlinks to a specific audiences.\n\n510\n00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:53.860\nSo, in other words, maybe only certain\npeople should be using this document\n\n511\n00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.990\nlibrary, then don't publish the link\nto that document library to everybody,\n\n512\n00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:00.230\nbecause there's gonna be some\ncontent that shouldn't belong there,\n\n513\n00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:01.470\npopulating that document library.\n\n514\n00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:06.570\nSo, you can use audiences to target,\nsay, based on project team name.\n\n515\n00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:07.670\nOnly those, say,\n\n516\n00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:11.130\nfive team members will get that\nshortcut in the Save As dialogue box.\n\n517\n00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:17.140\nAnd the last thing for this episode,\nfor me, for this demo,\n\n518\n00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:21.760\nis managing social tags and notes.\n\n519\n00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.800\nSo, this is a situation where maybe\nsomeone's made some inappropriate tag,\n\n520\n00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.626\nthey thought it was funny but\nit really isn't.\n\n521\n00:29:27.626 --> 00:29:30.240\nMaybe it's funny back in their\nhome state and the move, that's,\n\n522\n00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.440\nthat term or phrase is verboten.\n\n523\n00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:37.750\nSo, you can remove the offending\ntags based on a word,\n\n524\n00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:42.060\nor words, for example, and a date range,\nor even in a certain path in the URL.\n\n525\n00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:45.040\nSo, now that's important for\nharassment concerns, etc.\n\n526\n00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.230\n>> Absolutely.\n\n527\n00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:47.190\n>> Maybe somebody didn't know.\n\n528\n00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.730\nMaybe they did.\n\n529\n00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:50.850\nMaybe it's their last day and\nthey were venting.\n\n530\n00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:52.900\n>> My boss has a saying around here.\n\n531\n00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.724\nIt's always funny until you have\nto say it in front of a judge.\n\n532\n00:29:56.724 --> 00:30:00.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, Mark.\n\n533\n00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:02.380\nGreat look at, again,\nSharePoint Online, and\n\n534\n00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.020\nreally focusing in on that Administrative\nCenter for SharePoint online,\n\n535\n00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:09.990\nthings that we can do slightly different\nthan what we would do from on premise,\n\n536\n00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.260\nwhich is to be expected cuz Microsoft's\ntaken control over part of that.\n\n537\n00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:17.170\nBut that's okay with us,\nwe relinquish that part of the control and\n\n538\n00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:20.800\nwe're left with site collections and\ndown, still have most of the features and\n\n539\n00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:25.620\ncapabilities that were used to working\nwith with our SharePoint on premises, or\n\n540\n00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.650\non premise I should say.\n\n541\n00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:27.950\nSo, thank you very much for that.\n\n542\n00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:29.580\nI appreciate that great demonstration.\n\n543\n00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.550\nI hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n544\n00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:34.080\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n545\n00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:34.650\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n546\n00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:37.260\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n547\n00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:44.640\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.232\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:19.088\nToday we're doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:19.088 --> 00:00:21.958\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're actually continuing on,\n\n6\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.579\nthis is a part three so\nif you missed the previous two episodes,\n\n7\n00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.319\nmake sure you go back and check those out.\n\n8\n00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:30.384\nBut we're checking out SharePoint Online\nand integrating in Office 365 and\n\n9\n00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:33.839\ntaking a look at the interface cuz\nit's gonna be slightly different\n\n10\n00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:37.738\nthan what we're used to when we're\nlooking with SharePoint on-premise.\n\n11\n00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:41.098\nSo here to help walk us through that\nSharePoint Online interface is Mr.\n\n12\n00:00:41.098 --> 00:00:42.835\nMark Ingram, how's it going Mark?\n\n13\n00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:44.618\n>> Good Mike, thanks very much.\n\n14\n00:00:44.618 --> 00:00:47.644\nRemember, when you're dealing\nwith SharePoint Online you're\n\n15\n00:00:47.644 --> 00:00:51.166\ngetting the latest and greatest\nfunctionality, which eventually filters\n\n16\n00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:54.980\ndown to the on-prem deployments,\nwe're up to SharePoint 2016 now.\n\n17\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.410\nMicrosoft, I think they floated\na trial balloon about this but\n\n18\n00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.580\nnow they've definitely committed to future\non-prem releases as costumers request.\n\n19\n00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.910\nAnd I'm sure that there'll be an appetite\nfor that for at least the next decade.\n\n20\n00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.774\n>> Very good.\n>> So Microsoft is responsive to feedback.\n\n21\n00:01:09.774 --> 00:01:12.537\nIf you recall that when\nSharePoint was in its infancy,\n\n22\n00:01:12.537 --> 00:01:15.275\nthey were saying this is\nthe death of public folders.\n\n23\n00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.253\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then there was enough of\n\n24\n00:01:16.253 --> 00:01:18.480\na backlash, they said, okay, okay,\nyou can keep your public folders.\n\n25\n00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.180\nAnd they gave a ten year commitment during\nwhich they were not going to touch those.\n\n26\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.260\nSo you can't force people to change, you\ncan encourage them and they've certainly\n\n27\n00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.070\ndone this by all the developments\nthat's gone into SharePoint Online.\n\n28\n00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.739\nSo, if you think of SharePoint 2016 RTM,\nthink of that as a supported\n\n29\n00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:38.590\nsnapshot of the functionality\nthat exists in SharePoint Online.\n\n30\n00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.814\nSo again, you wanna be,\nmostly we wanna be ahead of the game,\n\n31\n00:01:41.814 --> 00:01:45.053\nother organizations prefer to\nlet all the bugs be worked out.\n\n32\n00:01:45.053 --> 00:01:46.607\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then be one or two,\n\n33\n00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:48.452\nsometimes major versions behind.\n\n34\n00:01:48.452 --> 00:01:52.180\nAnd then when I first encountered this, it\nwas surprising to me that large government\n\n35\n00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.610\norganizations and the military,\nand even academic institutions,\n\n36\n00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.660\npeople you think of with large,\npractically unlimited budgets for\n\n37\n00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.770\nwhatever they want, are some of\nthe slowest to adopt for various reasons.\n\n38\n00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.934\nSo let's continue on if\nwe could go back to my.\n\n39\n00:02:07.934 --> 00:02:14.244\nYeah, so in our last episode we ended\nup with talking about user profiles and\n\n40\n00:02:14.244 --> 00:02:19.388\nwe're gonna continue the tour\nof the interface with the BCS.\n\n41\n00:02:19.388 --> 00:02:22.827\nAnd that stands for\nBusiness Connectivity Services.\n\n42\n00:02:22.827 --> 00:02:27.166\nThe problem is with these multi-episode\nshows, I can only use lame jokes once.\n\n43\n00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:28.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I have\n\n44\n00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.130\nto remember which ones I've used.\n\n45\n00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.460\nSo I won't say the BCS one.\n\n46\n00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.183\nBut the point is think of BDS, sorry BCS,\nand actually used to be known as\n\n47\n00:02:37.183 --> 00:02:40.685\nthe BDC so I still mix up the acronym but\nthe same idea.\n\n48\n00:02:40.685 --> 00:02:44.174\nIt's middleware, so it connects us,\nour SharePoint deployment,\n\n49\n00:02:44.174 --> 00:02:46.000\nto any organized data source.\n\n50\n00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.354\nSometimes the data source exists,\nyou don't have to create the middleware,\n\n51\n00:02:50.354 --> 00:02:53.470\nlike SQL or ODBC or\nOracle databases, for example.\n\n52\n00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.500\nIf it's a more obscure data source,\n\n53\n00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.470\nthen you're gonna have to\nconfigure this middleware.\n\n54\n00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.500\nAnd this is where you can manage\nthings like connection settings and\n\n55\n00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.070\nyour external content types\nthat you're gonna connect to.\n\n56\n00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.120\nIn the Term Store.\n\n57\n00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.750\nWe had another episode for this.\n\n58\n00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.400\nSo right now it's a bit clunky, frankly,\n\n59\n00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.530\ngetting your on-premises taxonomy, which\nyou probably carefully crafted over time.\n\n60\n00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.970\nGoing through governance, setting up\nvarious Term Store administrators,\n\n61\n00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.510\nterm sets, and terms.\n\n62\n00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.840\nThe easiest way is to export that\ninto an Excel spreadsheet and\n\n63\n00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.080\nthen import it in the cloud.\n\n64\n00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.020\nSo that's one of those things that there\nis no seamless transference of terms,\n\n65\n00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.750\nso just know that.\n\n66\n00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:45.550\nIt's still worth doing compared to\nrecreating all your term sets and terms,\n\n67\n00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.190\nbut there are some default ones already\nset up for you in SharePoint Online.\n\n68\n00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.270\nUnder People, we've got Department,\nJob Title, Location.\n\n69\n00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.176\nSo just really sample data.\n\n70\n00:03:54.176 --> 00:03:58.929\nSo you're gonna wanna import your\ntaxonomy from your on-prem deployment,\n\n71\n00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:01.070\nif indeed you're even using one.\n\n72\n00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.506\nAnd if you're not, shame on you.\n\n73\n00:04:02.506 --> 00:04:04.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What are you waiting for?\n\n74\n00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.640\n>> That's right.\n>> No, but seriously,\n\n75\n00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.570\nit's a great way to restrict the input for\nsite columns to standardize data, for\n\n76\n00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.290\nreasons which we've gone\ninto in previous episodes.\n\n77\n00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.120\nRecords management, tune in to\nthe advanced SharePoint course for that.\n\n78\n00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.758\nThat's interface so you can help\ndefine a contract as a record and\n\n79\n00:04:23.758 --> 00:04:27.440\nthen it goes to separate storage area and\nis managed separately.\n\n80\n00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.940\nI won't go into detail there because\nit's in the advanced course.\n\n81\n00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.776\nSearch, we're gonna come back to\nbecause it's such a vast topic,\n\n82\n00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:38.400\nit warrants its own episode,\nor possibly two.\n\n83\n00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.080\nAnd the secure store, okay,\nthis is a place to store credentials\n\n84\n00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.870\nwhich we'll need to access other data\nsources, so itâs one place to go.\n\n85\n00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.330\nSo, for example, we're wanna connect\ninto external database, well, we need\n\n86\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.930\ncredentials to do that, this is a place\nwhere we can store those credentials.\n\n87\n00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.435\nAnd if I click on the New button,\nthrowing caution to the wind.\n\n88\n00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:05.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What's life without risk?\n\n89\n00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.007\nSo we specify the Target Application ID\nand then here's where we can specify\n\n90\n00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:11.870\ncredentials fields like User Name and\nPassword.\n\n91\n00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.320\nWe could even add fields\nwhich are relevant\n\n92\n00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.260\nto authenticate to that\nexternal data source.\n\n93\n00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.430\nAnd field type,\nit could be based on a certificate.\n\n94\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.710\nThis is not an exhaustive list as well,\nyou can create your own field type.\n\n95\n00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.770\nSo this is something that some\nof us associate with developers.\n\n96\n00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.742\nAnd this is something that they would do.\n\n97\n00:05:30.742 --> 00:05:33.010\nNow typically, in a SharePoint context,\n\n98\n00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.160\ndevelopers would deliver\nsomething to us like a solution.\n\n99\n00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.190\nWhich could include, for\nexample, a new feature.\n\n100\n00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.729\nSo we as admins enable the functionality\nthat the developers bring to us if\n\n101\n00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.450\nthere's some kind of non-out-of-the-box\ndevelopment that's required.\n\n102\n00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.210\nSo we don't have to know much about\nthe development or anything, we do have to\n\n103\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.270\nknow how to deploy the solution or\nfeature that they brought to us.\n\n104\n00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.150\nSo this is another example of, we should\nknow how to manage these settings for\n\n105\n00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.620\nsecure store to connect\nother data sources.\n\n106\n00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.505\nBut we don't have to actually\ncreate the connection.\n\n107\n00:06:05.505 --> 00:06:12.220\nIn the apps section we've got\na variety of links here, App Catalog.\n\n108\n00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.690\nSo this is a way of keeping in one\nplace applications for our users.\n\n109\n00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.190\nNow, couple things about that.\n\n110\n00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.540\nBecause of the advent of the cloud and\nthe ubiquity of free applications, or\n\n111\n00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.780\nlow cost, a lot of users are buying their\nown applications out of pocket, for\n\n112\n00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.600\nsay $1 or $2 at the Windows store.\n\n113\n00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.977\nOr the Apple store, Android store.\n\n114\n00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.689\nAnd using those apps,\nwhich they purchased,\n\n115\n00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:40.604\nto access Word content which you\nprobably don't even know about.\n\n116\n00:06:40.604 --> 00:06:44.266\nSo thankfully, there are tools now so\nwe can enumerate, just like with\n\n117\n00:06:44.266 --> 00:06:48.606\nSystem Center Configuration Manager\non-premises, we can enumerate hardware and\n\n118\n00:06:48.606 --> 00:06:52.090\nsoftware so we do know what's\nrunning in that environment.\n\n119\n00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.910\nIt's a whole other world in the cloud.\n\n120\n00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.300\nSo there are thousands of apps available.\n\n121\n00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.820\nAnd thankfully, now there are tools\nto know, a third party tool,\n\n122\n00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.650\nMicrosoft may have acquired\nthe technology, I can't remember.\n\n123\n00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.990\nBut if not, there's more than one third\nparty tool which lets you know exactly\n\n124\n00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.695\nwhich apps your users\nare accessing in the cloud and\n\n125\n00:07:11.695 --> 00:07:13.870\non-prem, from their work machine.\n\n126\n00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.080\nSo they're either provided by you or\nthey're domain join devices.\n\n127\n00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.000\nSo, in this bring your own\ndevice world in which we live,\n\n128\n00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.070\nthere are hundreds of millions of devices\nworldwide that are owned by users.\n\n129\n00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:30.990\nAnd yet, known about through\ncorporate IT with domain joining,\n\n130\n00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.240\nwhich is a way of getting some\ncontrol of those user devices without\n\n131\n00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.190\nowning them because after all,\nit's the user owned device.\n\n132\n00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.720\nNow we have the ability with remote wipe\nto target only business apps and data.\n\n133\n00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.922\nSo let's say a consultant finishes\na 90-day contract and was using his\n\n134\n00:07:50.922 --> 00:07:57.235\nown device which was interacting with\nour Active Directory environment.\n\n135\n00:07:57.235 --> 00:08:01.670\nWe can remotely wipe all traces of\nbusiness data and applications on that\n\n136\n00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.959\ndevice while not touching at all any\nof that person's personal data or\n\n137\n00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:06.990\napplications.\n\n138\n00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.790\nOkay, so\n\n139\n00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:13.760\nlet's see what happens when I click on\nPurchase Apps from the SharePoint Store.\n\n140\n00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.929\nOkay, now this is a lie,\nthe site does support apps.\n\n141\n00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.270\nSharePoint Online, right now, doesn't know\nthat I've already set up my app catalogs.\n\n142\n00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.750\nThere's a disconnect there,\nbut I did do it successfully.\n\n143\n00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.260\nBut let's scan some of\nthe apps that are available.\n\n144\n00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.890\nYou can filter by category,\nthis is handy, Best Apps of the Year.\n\n145\n00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.700\nWoohoo, let's check that out.\n\n146\n00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.198\nHere's one, KasPer Pro HR.\n\n147\n00:08:38.198 --> 00:08:41.835\nThere's a workflow, so Nintex is a third\nparty provider that does some great\n\n148\n00:08:41.835 --> 00:08:44.050\nworkflows with SharePoint,\nand now Office 365.\n\n149\n00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:50.290\nSo most of you watching are familiar\nwith app stores with various platforms.\n\n150\n00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.000\nYou go in there, some of them are free,\nsome you pay for.\n\n151\n00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.390\n>> Now, these that we pay for,\nwe go here to this Purchase Apps.\n\n152\n00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.710\nThey show up in our app catalog, and\n\n153\n00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.090\nthen our users can get it from\nthere without purchasing?\n\n154\n00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.030\nIt's like we're just making\nthem available for them?\n\n155\n00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.620\n>> Correct.\n\n156\n00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.570\n>> Okay.\n>> So we want to prevent\n\n157\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.020\nusers from downloading just any old app\nin their environment, and we can do that.\n\n158\n00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.690\nWe can restrict them to going to our\nWindows Store, which includes some\n\n159\n00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:17.040\nMicrosoft provided apps, and whatever\nother third party apps we want to make\n\n160\n00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.990\navailable to our users, and whatever line\nof business apps that we've created.\n\n161\n00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.900\nWe can also manage licensing, as well,\nyou don't wanna get caught in\n\n162\n00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.960\none of those licensing stings,\nit's the wrong kind of publicity to get.\n\n163\n00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.600\nSo, they make it easy to handle licensing\nand making sure you're in compliance.\n\n164\n00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.220\nAnd we have other options here in\nthe apps section to monitor, so\n\n165\n00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.130\nwe can track the usage of applications.\n\n166\n00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.830\nWe can review errors, so there's apps for\nthrowing errors for one or more users.\n\n167\n00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.290\nWe can monitor that scenario.\n\n168\n00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:49.840\nAnd then App Permissions,\nas well, we can monitor.\n\n169\n00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.520\nLet's go over now to the settings option.\n\n170\n00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:59.690\nOkay, so, OneDrive for Business,\nwe may want to expose to our users or not.\n\n171\n00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.930\nAnd various sites in our environment\nwe may wanna expose or not.\n\n172\n00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.715\nStorage Management,\nyou can have this automatically covered.\n\n173\n00:10:11.715 --> 00:10:14.506\nSo, remember, this inform admin\ntasks that Microsoft is handling, so\n\n174\n00:10:14.506 --> 00:10:15.799\nwe don't have to worry about it.\n\n175\n00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:20.921\nSo, I recommend leaving that at automatic.\n\n176\n00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:23.341\nAs a tenant admin, we can override and\n\n177\n00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:26.451\nset usage limits on a per\nsite collection level.\n\n178\n00:10:26.451 --> 00:10:30.490\nBut, again, there's enough that's gonna\nbe new in the interface for you to learn.\n\n179\n00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.770\nLet's automate where we can, and\nif you feel like getting exercise in more\n\n180\n00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.660\nmanual control later then,\nby all means, revisit.\n\n181\n00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.380\nNow, there certainly have been some issues\nintegrating OneDrive with SharePoint.\n\n182\n00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.110\nSo I recommend the new experience.\n\n183\n00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.500\nBut like many kinds of\ninterfaces in Microsoft,\n\n184\n00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.430\nthey give you a chance to\nuse the old interface.\n\n185\n00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.990\nThis is certainly true in Azure,\nfor example.\n\n186\n00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.530\nAnd, of course, they have to brand it\nwith something clever like, classic.\n\n187\n00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:55.840\n>> The classic portal.\n\n188\n00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.830\n>> That's right,\nlike classic Coke, but different.\n\n189\n00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:03.640\nBut, eventually, you're gonna have to\nmove over to the new interface, so you\n\n190\n00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.740\nmay have some testing to do, for example,\non certain applications or work flows.\n\n191\n00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.860\nYou're not sure if they're gonna\nwork in the new interface.\n\n192\n00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.420\nBut know that the classic mode\nwill be not only deprecated,\n\n193\n00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:19.430\nbut removed as an option, sooner or\nlater so you wanna be ahead of the curve.\n\n194\n00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:23.061\nWhenever you can plan anything,\nStephen Covey's four quadrants,\n\n195\n00:11:23.061 --> 00:11:24.510\nthe long-term planning.\n\n196\n00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.740\nLong-term and non-urgent needs is where\nyou should be focusing your time.\n\n197\n00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.200\nSo we've put out enough fires already,\nprobably, so\n\n198\n00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.640\nwhenever you get a chance, hey,\nMicrosoft's giving you a heads up,\n\n199\n00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.310\nthere's gonna be lead time,\nmonths, maybe years in some cases.\n\n200\n00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.690\nBut don't leave it to the last minute\nbecause there's other things you're gonna\n\n201\n00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.840\nneed to be doing.\n\n202\n00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.538\nWe'll leave it in new experience for now.\n\n203\n00:11:41.538 --> 00:11:43.190\nAnd, now, the Admin Center,\n\n204\n00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:46.260\nI've been showing you the advance\nAdmin Center Experience.\n\n205\n00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.065\nThe simple experience is a stripped down,\nless options.\n\n206\n00:11:49.065 --> 00:11:51.508\nSo I'm not someone who likes\nrestricted options, so\n\n207\n00:11:51.508 --> 00:11:54.614\nI'll definitely leave that\nAdmin Center Experience at advanced.\n\n208\n00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:58.558\nNow, something really\ncool is the Office Graph.\n\n209\n00:11:58.558 --> 00:12:01.792\nSo, if you remember,\nMicrosoft bought 5% of Facebook,\n\n210\n00:12:01.792 --> 00:12:06.192\nso you can expect some lessons learned\nfrom Microsoft's end with Facebook, and\n\n211\n00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:08.088\nto implement them in SharePoint.\n\n212\n00:12:08.088 --> 00:12:10.020\nAnd then we have that with Yammer.\n\n213\n00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.480\nAnd we'll look at Yammer.\n\n214\n00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.802\nI love saying that.\n\n215\n00:12:12.802 --> 00:12:13.962\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It reminds me\n\n216\n00:12:13.962 --> 00:12:15.210\nof yada, yada, yada.\n\n217\n00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.530\nBut I digress.\n\n218\n00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.970\nSo Office Graph,\nsimilar idea to Facebook Graph.\n\n219\n00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.436\nIt caused a lot of controversy when\nit came out cuz people were worried\n\n220\n00:12:22.436 --> 00:12:24.410\nabout profiling and being searched for\n\n221\n00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.880\nusing fields that some people\nweren't comfortable with.\n\n222\n00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.640\nHow it impacts our environment in\nMicrosoft, it's a single API, and\n\n223\n00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.960\nwe can use an application called Delve,\nwhich is really cool.\n\n224\n00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:41.690\nThis will surface information on your\nMy Site, say, that's relevant to you.\n\n225\n00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.330\nJust like you might subscribe to Bing or\nLinkedIn.\n\n226\n00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.430\nThey have those custom news updates\nthat are delivered five days a week.\n\n227\n00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.470\nAnd it's remarkably relevant.\n\n228\n00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.090\nWhy?\n\n229\n00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.200\nBecause its uses information\nthat they know about you.\n\n230\n00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:58.753\nSo, for example, with LinkedIn,\nthey know who my connections are,\n\n231\n00:12:58.753 --> 00:13:02.960\nmy fields of interests,\ngroups that I belong to.\n\n232\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.420\nSimilarly, in a SharePoint\ncontext with Office Graph,\n\n233\n00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:11.680\nthey know who my colleagues are, they know\nwho I'm collaborating on documents with,\n\n234\n00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:17.110\nmaybe site links I've gone to, favorite\nI've set, including email communications.\n\n235\n00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.941\nSo it's as if someone was looking over\nmy shoulder, in a non-threatening way.\n\n236\n00:13:20.941 --> 00:13:21.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n237\n00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.790\njust watching what I do in an IT context.\n\n238\n00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:29.780\nAnd based on all that information\ngained from a variety of data points,\n\n239\n00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.870\nsharing information with me that it\nthinks I would wanna know about.\n\n240\n00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.750\nSo it's actually extremely useful.\n\n241\n00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:40.790\nAgain, I keep talking about we're\noverwhelmed with data, so we need someone\n\n242\n00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:45.580\nor something, like Office Graph and\nDelve, leveraging it to expose us to\n\n243\n00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.990\ninformation that we care about, without us\nhaving to manually sort through websites,\n\n244\n00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:54.430\nfile shares, so the information comes\nto us in a timely and relevant manner.\n\n245\n00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:59.020\nSo absolutely keep that default on,\nallow access to Office Graph.\n\n246\n00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:04.670\nNow, for social collaboration, the default\nis to use a SharePoint news feed.\n\n247\n00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.050\nI could use Yammer.com for that.\n\n248\n00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:12.175\nI'm gonna show you Yammer separately,\nso we'll leave that default set.\n\n249\n00:14:12.175 --> 00:14:14.080\nNow, another new thing that's kinda cool,\n\n250\n00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.086\nI think they actually streamed\nthe Super Bowl one year on Azure.\n\n251\n00:14:17.086 --> 00:14:17.659\n>> Really?\n\n252\n00:14:17.659 --> 00:14:20.230\n>> I'm 90% sure that happened.\n\n253\n00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.920\nAnyway, in any event,\nstreaming video is more and\n\n254\n00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.080\nmore popular as a service now,\nand the default is to allow for\n\n255\n00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.570\nstreaming video through the Azure Media\nServices, and have a video portal set up.\n\n256\n00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:31.828\nSo, this is not your father's SharePoint.\n\n257\n00:14:31.828 --> 00:14:33.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're hip and timely with video,\n\n258\n00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.480\nyou might have seen some video\nkind of backgrounds where there's\n\n259\n00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.140\naction happening in the background,\nyou can still click on things.\n\n260\n00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:40.846\n>> Nice.\n>> So, yeah,\n\n261\n00:14:40.846 --> 00:14:44.155\nit just makes it a more\ninteresting experience for users.\n\n262\n00:14:44.155 --> 00:14:48.690\nNow, a key consideration, again,\nactually making the change in SharePoint,\n\n263\n00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.370\nanyone can click a radial button.\n\n264\n00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:54.700\nBut knowing what the appropriate button to\nclick is, that's often a governance issue.\n\n265\n00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.300\nThis is one of those scenarios,\nwith external sharing.\n\n266\n00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.665\nAre we gonna be kinda living in our\nown walled garden, if you will,\n\n267\n00:15:00.665 --> 00:15:02.660\nno sharing outside the organization?\n\n268\n00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:07.989\nOr, are we gonna allow for external users\nto access our content in SharePoint,\n\n269\n00:15:07.989 --> 00:15:11.261\nbut only if they sign in\nas authenticated users?\n\n270\n00:15:11.261 --> 00:15:15.448\nThe other option is,\nwe're able to send sharing invitations to\n\n271\n00:15:15.448 --> 00:15:20.102\ninclude external users, say,\nparticipating in a document library so\n\n272\n00:15:20.102 --> 00:15:25.050\nthey can collaborate on documents there,\nedit, check them out.\n\n273\n00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:29.240\nAnd we can also have anonymous\naccess links with that option.\n\n274\n00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.630\nIn other words,\nthere's no sign in required.\n\n275\n00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.800\nJust by virtue of having received an email\nwith a link to access a document library,\n\n276\n00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.510\nfor example, that is enough.\n\n277\n00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.230\nThere's no authentication to manage,\n\n278\n00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.920\nthere's none required from\nthe external user end.\n\n279\n00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.200\nSo that's certainly easier to\nadminister cuz there's nothing to do.\n\n280\n00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.734\nSo that default is to allow for\nthat behavior.\n\n281\n00:15:47.734 --> 00:15:51.187\nAs long as they e-mail you an invitation\nto participate in the document library,\n\n282\n00:15:51.187 --> 00:15:53.500\nyou can participate without\nhaving to authenticate.\n\n283\n00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.952\nOkay, now there's always a consideration\n\n284\n00:15:57.952 --> 00:16:02.535\nregarding old versions of site collection.\n\n285\n00:16:02.535 --> 00:16:06.660\nSo in SharePpoint 2013 On-Prem,\nwe had the ability for\n\n286\n00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:12.370\nusers to continue using the SharePoint\n2010 version of their site collection and\n\n287\n00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.840\nthen upgrade at a time convenient for\nthem.\n\n288\n00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:20.160\nWe don't have that as much now in\na SharePoint online experience.\n\n289\n00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.710\nWith this default setting of prevent\ncreation of old version site\n\n290\n00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.070\ncollections but allow creation\nof new version site collections.\n\n291\n00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:34.020\nOpt in upgrade means people can,\nif you pour it over to your content,\n\n292\n00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.200\nsay from on prem to the cloud,\nit was created in SharePoint 2013,\n\n293\n00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.630\nyou can give the users\nthe option to Upgrade.\n\n294\n00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.060\nSo yeah, I'm definitely a fan of not\n\n295\n00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.630\nallowing older versions of\nSharePoint site collections.\n\n296\n00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.349\nLet's move forward.\n\n297\n00:16:50.349 --> 00:16:53.097\nIt's much easier to support the current\nversion than to have to worry about\n\n298\n00:16:53.097 --> 00:16:55.509\ncustomizations that might not\nwork with the previous versions.\n\n299\n00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:57.928\nSo sometimes, you have to drag people,\nkicking and screaming.\n\n300\n00:16:57.928 --> 00:17:00.568\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or don't give them a choice.\n\n301\n00:17:00.568 --> 00:17:01.688\nOr don't even let them\nknow there's a choice.\n\n302\n00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:02.268\n>> Exactly.\n\n303\n00:17:02.268 --> 00:17:04.526\nSurprise them.\n\n304\n00:17:04.526 --> 00:17:05.848\n>> Surprise!\n\n305\n00:17:05.848 --> 00:17:08.538\nSo, there may be some slight\nchanges to functionality, but\n\n306\n00:17:08.538 --> 00:17:09.870\nthen they'll get used to it.\n\n307\n00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:12.460\nThere might be some griping, but\nthen they're in the new environment.\n\n308\n00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.218\nBeautiful thing.\n\n309\n00:17:13.218 --> 00:17:14.638\nInformation rights management.\n\n310\n00:17:14.638 --> 00:17:19.158\nOkay, this requires a rights\nmanagement services infrastructure.\n\n311\n00:17:19.158 --> 00:17:23.630\nI love IRM because it gives\nyou additional layers of\n\n312\n00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:27.798\nsecurity beyond any\nSharePoint permissions.\n\n313\n00:17:27.798 --> 00:17:32.370\nOn a per document basis or a document\nlibrary basis beyond what you're familiar\n\n314\n00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.730\nwith NTFS, or share permissions.\n\n315\n00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:38.730\nSo some further restrictions, as long\nas I have the authoring capability for\n\n316\n00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.240\ninformation rights management,\nthat means I can allow.\n\n317\n00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.800\nOr a sign, particularly restrictions\nto documents, for example.\n\n318\n00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:50.980\nDo not print, which means if someone\ntries to use the print screen command or\n\n319\n00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:54.550\nControl C to copy any content,\nthat's not going to work.\n\n320\n00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.910\nAnother one,\nrestriction is do not forward.\n\n321\n00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.230\nThis is very useful if you have\ninternal use only communications.\n\n322\n00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.040\n>> This should not go outside the\nFirewall, if anyone tries to send it as\n\n323\n00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.120\nan attachment or try to grant access\nto somebody outside the organization.\n\n324\n00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.330\nThey'll be prevented from doing that.\n\n325\n00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.050\nLet's see,\nyou can also expire content with IRM,\n\n326\n00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.660\nthis is very useful because, maybe\nyou've got time sensitive information.\n\n327\n00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.780\nFor example,\nyou're bidding on a construction project,\n\n328\n00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.260\nmaybe with three other firms for a bridge.\n\n329\n00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.840\nThe contest close date\nlet's say is July 15th, so\n\n330\n00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.680\non November 15th you're going to say,\nthat content expires.\n\n331\n00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.240\nIn other words,\n\n332\n00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.250\neven if someone has a copy of it on\ntheir computer the rights license,\n\n333\n00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.840\nwhich is attached to the file, will expire\nand the content will become unreadable.\n\n334\n00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.460\nThere are subscription models\nlike that with Apple Music and\n\n335\n00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:42.160\nother vendors where you can you're good\nto go as long as you pay the subscription\n\n336\n00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.490\nas soon as you've stopped paying,\nmaybe 30 day grace period.\n\n337\n00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.528\nAll that information is unreadable.\n\n338\n00:18:47.528 --> 00:18:51.096\nSo information rights management\nis a whole other conversation, but\n\n339\n00:18:51.096 --> 00:18:54.008\nI just wanted to make you,\nlet you know it was available.\n\n340\n00:18:54.008 --> 00:18:58.019\nAnd should users get to create a site?\n\n341\n00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:01.040\nAnd where should they create it?\n\n342\n00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:06.350\nSo you can see this is pre-populated\nhere with HTTPS, so secure by default.\n\n343\n00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:09.450\nThere's my domain name\ndemoace.sharepoint.com/ and\n\n344\n00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:16.230\nthen that's where the new sites get\ncreated, that part of the URL path.\n\n345\n00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:20.420\nNow, I've said this before and I'll say it\nagain, if you want an environment where\n\n346\n00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.019\npeople have to make long form requests\nin triplicate to get to be able to do\n\n347\n00:19:24.019 --> 00:19:28.091\nsomething like create a new site, if you\nwant that kind of lockdown environment,\n\n348\n00:19:28.091 --> 00:19:30.768\nSharePoint's probably not\nthe technology for you.\n\n349\n00:19:30.768 --> 00:19:31.414\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n350\n00:19:31.414 --> 00:19:34.960\nabsolutely people should be\nallowed to create their own sites.\n\n351\n00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.830\nOr maybe they have to show that they've\ngone to some one to learn session\n\n352\n00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:41.650\nfirst and then they're given the keys\nto be able to do that sort of thing.\n\n353\n00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.240\nNow site classification,\nin another episode,\n\n354\n00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:49.170\nwe'd be looking at content types,\nsite columns, so a way of organized, or\n\n355\n00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:53.790\napplying meta-data to documents that's\nabout data in an organized fashion.\n\n356\n00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:56.430\n>> Well,\nanother way to help users locate and\n\n357\n00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:02.160\nclass find information as they're created\nis by requiring site classification.\n\n358\n00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.760\nThis means,\n\n359\n00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:09.060\nif it's a required choice they have to\nclassify the site that they're creating.\n\n360\n00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.780\nSo that could be based on geography,\n\n361\n00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:18.110\ndivision, departments,\nmaybe customer number.\n\n362\n00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.440\nSo anyway, I want to get you thinking,\nas well, about different ways you can\n\n363\n00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:27.540\nclassify information to make\naccess to the content easier for\n\n364\n00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.280\nusers looking for it, and also a way to\nmanage the content in your environment.\n\n365\n00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.040\nSo this could be optional required\nto classify the site, and\n\n366\n00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.400\nthat's whatever the user chooses when\nthey create the site collection.\n\n367\n00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.800\nAnd then secondary contacts are useful.\n\n368\n00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:46.170\nAs I say, the primary site collection\nadministrator might be off on pat leave\n\n369\n00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.430\nand then you need to get in\ntouch with that person for\n\n370\n00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.630\nsome reason, maybe someone's got\nan access request, for example,\n\n371\n00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.260\nthey want to participate in that site.\n\n372\n00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:58.311\nHaving a secondary contact and\nrequiring one means that\n\n373\n00:20:58.311 --> 00:21:02.620\nboth primary and secondary site collection\nadministrators will get notifications or\n\n374\n00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:07.930\nmaybe there's a quota warning,\nmeet 75 percent of quota both admins\n\n375\n00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:13.030\nshould know so\nthey can take appropriate action.\n\n376\n00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:13.530\nOkay.\n\n377\n00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:18.280\nNow, do you want to allow,\nwith all the vulnerabilities out there.\n\n378\n00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:23.280\nCrypto, scams, ransomware,\ndeleting content as everyday goes by.\n\n379\n00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.450\nScripting is often a culprit,\nso you may want to prevent, and\n\n380\n00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:33.180\nthat's the default, prevent users from\nrunning custom scripts pn personal sites.\n\n381\n00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.370\nAnd you might say well it's a personal\nsite, what harm could be done?\n\n382\n00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:38.650\nWell a lot of harm could be done,\nso I like that that's the default.\n\n383\n00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.410\nNow there may be a business reason to\nallow for custom scripts, in which\n\n384\n00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:45.330\ncase you could choose \"allow users to\nrun custom script on personal sites\".\n\n385\n00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.255\nThere's a similar option for\n\n386\n00:21:48.255 --> 00:21:51.750\nself-service created sites\nthat users might have created.\n\n387\n00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:56.420\nAnd a helpful link ID there on the side\nif you want more info on custom scripts.\n\n388\n00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:58.420\nOkay.\n\n389\n00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:05.520\nNow, depending on how cutting edge you\nare and how cutting edge your users are,\n\n390\n00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.910\nand how comfortable they are with\nchange you may want to enable or\n\n391\n00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:11.810\ndisable preview features.\n\n392\n00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:14.170\nPreview features are.\n\n393\n00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:18.140\nIt's functionality that may or\nmay not be in the product full time.\n\n394\n00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.370\nBut Microsoft is experimenting,\nin the wild.\n\n395\n00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:22.500\nSo you're a guinea pig.\n\n396\n00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.590\nJust like Facebook, and LinkedIn, others,\nwill experiment with some functionality.\n\n397\n00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.290\nThey're not committing to keeping it.\n\n398\n00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.610\nIn fact, they probably,\nsometimes don't announce that it's coming,\n\n399\n00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:32.280\nit just shows up.\n\n400\n00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.325\nAnd you say wait a minute,\nI remember that button.\n\n401\n00:22:34.325 --> 00:22:35.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well that could be a preview feature,\n\n402\n00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:40.150\nwhich may or may not be part\nof the product going forward.\n\n403\n00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:44.770\nSo if that's sort of thing bothers you,\nyou don't like those kind of surprises,\n\n404\n00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.520\nthen you'd wanna disable preview features.\n\n405\n00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.160\nAnd again, helpful link if you're\nnot sure about them, you can decide.\n\n406\n00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.930\nWorkflow, so workflows could definitely\nintroduce some kind of vulnerability.\n\n407\n00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.790\nAnd as we've talked\nabout in other episodes,\n\n408\n00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:03.910\nwhatever you can dream up in an electronic\ncontext, in terms of workflow,\n\n409\n00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:06.950\nyou can incorporate either on-prem or\nonline.\n\n410\n00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.880\nSo that could be the entire\nonboarding process for example, for\n\n411\n00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:15.470\na new hire or creating contracts\nwith partner organizations.\n\n412\n00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.740\nSo, no matter how complex\nyou can imagine it,\n\n413\n00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:21.900\nwith database access,\nmultiple approvals at different levels.\n\n414\n00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.390\nCalculated values or achieving databases.\n\n415\n00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:28.100\nVery complex workflows,\nwhatever you can dream up you can do.\n\n416\n00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.409\nYou may wanna block\nSharePoint 2013 workflows,\n\n417\n00:23:32.409 --> 00:23:37.195\nmaybe you don't wanna use any\nworkflows at all early on your\n\n418\n00:23:37.195 --> 00:23:41.418\nSharePoint online journey,\nand then access apps.\n\n419\n00:23:41.418 --> 00:23:44.158\nSo Access is a junior sequel\ndatabase if you like.\n\n420\n00:23:44.158 --> 00:23:49.225\nYou may want to enable or\ndisable that functionality,\n\n421\n00:23:49.225 --> 00:23:53.558\nor the ability to access apps-\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n422\n00:23:53.558 --> 00:23:55.158\n>> if you will.\n\n423\n00:23:55.158 --> 00:23:58.030\nOkay.\n\n424\n00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:01.370\nActually, one more thing here,\nlet's go to configure hybrid.\n\n425\n00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:07.970\nSo we could have hybrid One Drive and\nsites feature.\n\n426\n00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.210\nSo, these both involve re-direction.\n\n427\n00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:15.180\nThe best way to describe that is,\nfor example, when users save\n\n428\n00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.970\nsomething to their my documents folder,\neven their desktop on-prem.\n\n429\n00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.250\nYou might of set up redirection\nthrough your policy so\n\n430\n00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:25.420\nthat it actually gets\nsaved on your file server.\n\n431\n00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:30.030\nThe user doesn't know or necessarily care,\nthe benefit is to us as IT admins is\n\n432\n00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.930\nwe can have a centralized place\nto backup important content.\n\n433\n00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:38.660\nSimilar idea with Hybrid OneDrive and\nsites, there's redirection involved so\n\n434\n00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:44.190\nthat we can centralize the one\ndrive material and sites online.\n\n435\n00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.660\n>> Alright, Marco again a lot\nof great information there,\n\n436\n00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:54.200\na really great look at\nSharePoint online and\n\n437\n00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.310\nwhat we can expect if we need to manage\nthat SharePoint online environment.\n\n438\n00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:59.600\nSo we thank you for that,\nappreciate those great Demos.\n\n439\n00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.130\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n440\n00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.788\nSigning of for ITProTV, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n441\n00:25:04.788 --> 00:25:05.628\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n442\n00:25:05.628 --> 00:25:08.168\n>> And

here\non ITProTV I'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.297 --> 00:00:22.049\ntoday we're doing SharePoint 2016, and\nspecifically in this episode, we're\n\n5\n00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:26.680\ngonna be taking a look at configuring our\nSharePoint online search capabilities.\n\n6\n00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.150\nWe've all ready talked about how really\nfantastic SharePoint is about being able\n\n7\n00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.160\nto search across all of our\ndifferent data sources and\n\n8\n00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.950\ndata stores, we got that same\ncapability up in SharePoint online.\n\n9\n00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.740\nSo here to help us get that set up is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n10\n00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.630\nHow's it going, Mark?\n\n11\n00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.062\n>> Hey, Mike.\nThanks very much.\n\n12\n00:00:45.062 --> 00:00:45.910\nAll right,\n\n13\n00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.910\nlet's look at the search admin interface\nin our SharePoint online environment.\n\n14\n00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.700\nSo first thing we're going to\nlook at is our search schema.\n\n15\n00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.700\nWhat is a schema?\n\n16\n00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.320\nWe come across this in exchange,\nfor example, active directory.\n\n17\n00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.200\nThink of it as a skeleton or framework.\n\n18\n00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.340\nClick on that one and\n\n19\n00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.130\nthese show all the properties that\nare searchable, therefore queriable.\n\n20\n00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.110\nNow.\n\n21\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.500\nYou may not need to crawl\nall these properties.\n\n22\n00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.390\nIn other words, glean or\ngather information during a crawl process,\n\n23\n00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.240\nwhere we're pulling information\ninto an index, it gets indexed and\n\n24\n00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.620\nthen we can search based on\nthose fields or properties.\n\n25\n00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.860\nSo, you may have no need for\nsome of these properties,\n\n26\n00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.760\nin which case you can disable them or\nturn them off so those properties won't\n\n27\n00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.240\nbe crawled in the first place, if they\nexist in the crawled content sources.\n\n28\n00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.740\n>> Will that help us performance wise if\nwe just disable some of those unnecessary\n\n29\n00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.670\nsearch terms?\n\n30\n00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.480\n>> Absolutely, well specifically indexing.\n\n31\n00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.600\nSo if the content of the metadata\nis not indexed in the first place,\n\n32\n00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.320\nits gonna be faster and make for more\nefficient index and then a faster career\n\n33\n00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.070\nresults as well when it does come time\nto play and actually execute a search.\n\n34\n00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.526\nNow, having said that you may have custom\nfields that do need to be indexed.\n\n35\n00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:12.420\nSo, you may have for example a rank or\na serial number, any kind of custom\n\n36\n00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.260\nfield that you want that property\nIndex and therefore searchable.\n\n37\n00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.520\nSo, look at some of what exists here,\nthings like content type\n\n38\n00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.270\ncreated by, this is just one page worth.\n\n39\n00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.800\nSo, if I scroll over here, there's also\n\n40\n00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.000\nI know what way over here, let's probably\ndo the plug in this to my cable here but\n\n41\n00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.580\nif I click the arrow there and\nthis is properties 51 to 100.\n\n42\n00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.670\nSo there are literally hundreds of\nproperties that can be crawled,\n\n43\n00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.030\ndetected language for example, document\nsignature, let's look at one more screen.\n\n44\n00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.760\nWe're not gonna cover absolutely\neverything, all the properties, but\n\n45\n00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.260\njust to show you what can be crawled,\ntherefore indexed and searched on.\n\n46\n00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.212\nVarious date fields, descriptions.\n\n47\n00:03:09.487 --> 00:03:09.987\n>> Nice.\n\n48\n00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.039\n>> Should be still loading, actually.\n\n49\n00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:16.616\n[NOISE] Let's try that again.\n\n50\n00:03:16.616 --> 00:03:19.645\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Load, I command you.\n\n51\n00:03:19.645 --> 00:03:24.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Are we out of page?\n\n52\n00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.180\nThat is very odd.\n\n53\n00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.100\nIn any event,\nit goes down farther than that.\n\n54\n00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.310\nI'm not sure why you can't get\nmore than a hundred right now.\n\n55\n00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.300\nOkay, if I click on the Crawl properties,\nLink?\n\n56\n00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.880\nThis shows mappings, as well.\n\n57\n00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.400\nSo, we can map our property\nname to a particular property.\n\n58\n00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.590\nSo, we might have different names,\nfor example, for\n\n59\n00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.570\na property, versus what a property is\ncalled in a particular application.\n\n60\n00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.440\nSo we wanna standardize on that.\n\n61\n00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.030\nSo what we think we're looking for\nname, that can be kinda vague,\n\n62\n00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.830\nwhat does name mean for example?\n\n63\n00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.110\nFacts number here, always amuses me.\n\n64\n00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.720\nSo SPS is sort of remanent of\nprevious versions of SharePoint.\n\n65\n00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.210\nJob title, another option there.\n\n66\n00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.033\nAnd let's go back now.\n\n67\n00:04:24.856 --> 00:04:28.120\nOop, one too many.\n\n68\n00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.740\nThere we go.\n\n69\n00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.590\nOne too many.\nHere we go.\n\n70\n00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.160\nSo Authoritative Pages is\nthe next section, so Search,\n\n71\n00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.730\nthere's a lot of secret sauce in terms\nof how search results are ranked.\n\n72\n00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.200\nAll major search engines\nhave this secret sauce.\n\n73\n00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.330\nAnd that's the key\ndistinguishing characteristic of\n\n74\n00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.620\nwhat makes a better search engine.\n\n75\n00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.890\nSpeed, but also accuracy and ideally\ngetting results in that first page.\n\n76\n00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.520\nAgain, it is a manual process.\n\n77\n00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.883\nOne of the manual things we can do\nis to manage authoritative pages.\n\n78\n00:05:02.631 --> 00:05:08.610\nSo, we can specify by URL sites that\nshould be considered authoritative.\n\n79\n00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.490\nFor example, if we're a university,\nthen tenured professors, links\n\n80\n00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.430\nto their sites or blog sites for example\nor articles, document libraries etc.,\n\n81\n00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.200\nthat they participate in those pages\nshould be considered more authoritative.\n\n82\n00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.230\nSo we can literally manually\nput them in the section called\n\n83\n00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.690\nmost authoritative pages.\n\n84\n00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.320\nNow we can have second and\nthird level authoritative pages as well.\n\n85\n00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.470\nSo if URL appears in either of those,\nthe waiting will be less but\n\n86\n00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.570\nhaving appeared in second or\nthird level authoritative pages boxes,\n\n87\n00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:50.030\nit will still bump up\nsearch results accordingly.\n\n88\n00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.860\nSo that we wanna eliminate users having to\nscroll through multiple pages of search\n\n89\n00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.960\nresults, they can refine search results.\n\n90\n00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.327\nSo typically users no matter\nwhere they're searching online or\n\n91\n00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:05.580\non prem, often the first page\nresults is not an ending point,\n\n92\n00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.670\nit's a starting point and for\nthe refiners can be used.\n\n93\n00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.150\nSo, for example, you might get 1.8 million\nresults returned from what you thought was\n\n94\n00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.500\na pretty specific query, and\n\n95\n00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.510\nthen you realize okay, I have to narrow\nthis down by a date range, author.\n\n96\n00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.465\nPerhaps content type or other field\nto get down to some manageable level.\n\n97\n00:06:23.465 --> 00:06:27.070\nNobody's got time to go through 1.8\nmillion [LAUGH] search results, but\n\n98\n00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.770\nif you get down to 3,000 search\nresult you are doing pretty well and\n\n99\n00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.260\nmaybe you are to scroll a few pages there.\n\n100\n00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.860\nSo refiners are useful as well.\n\n101\n00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.985\nSo that's authority to pages then we have\nthe wingnuts, who are maybe tenured.\n\n102\n00:06:40.985 --> 00:06:41.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But let's face it,\n\n103\n00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.150\nthey're past their prime.\n\n104\n00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.380\nAnd we want to demote their site.\n\n105\n00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.940\nSo, the opposite of authoritative sites,\n\n106\n00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.450\nwe can put people in\nnon-authoritative sites.\n\n107\n00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.590\nSo, insert your political enemy here,\nor their world view.\n\n108\n00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.120\nSo, you can demote those sites.\n\n109\n00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.840\n>> I assume that'd be especially useful,\nsay in a corporate environment,\n\n110\n00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.140\nenterprise environment, where you\nmaybe have resources available to you,\n\n111\n00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.780\nend users, manuals, instructions.\n\n112\n00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:07.920\nAnd then you've got my sites, and\n\n113\n00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.260\nmaybe some of your users are putting their\nown take on how something should be done.\n\n114\n00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.980\nYou probably don't want those coming\nup in the top of the results, right?\n\n115\n00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.540\nYou wanna see your company's\ndocumentation first.\n\n116\n00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.750\n>> Exactly, good example.\n\n117\n00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:21.970\nFor sure.\n\n118\n00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.410\nLet's look at query\nsuggestion settings next.\n\n119\n00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.270\nSo, if you typed in most search engines,\nyou start typing and results start to\n\n120\n00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.390\nappear based on just even a few\ncharacters that you've started to type.\n\n121\n00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.820\nYou're like, wow,\nthis search engine is psychic or creepy.\n\n122\n00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.520\n>> Yeah, one or the other.\n\n123\n00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.490\n>> So, that is query suggestion settings.\n\n124\n00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.640\nAnd the user has the ability\nto disable this functionality.\n\n125\n00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:51.791\nBy default, this checkbox is selected,\nand that is show search suggestions.\n\n126\n00:07:51.791 --> 00:07:55.932\nAnd then, again, maybe in your\ncountry there's a single language.\n\n127\n00:07:55.932 --> 00:07:57.682\nYou don't have to worry about\na multi-language environment.\n\n128\n00:07:57.682 --> 00:08:00.671\nBut if you are in\na multi-language environment,\n\n129\n00:08:00.671 --> 00:08:04.741\nyou can choose In what language\nshould suggestion phrases be made?\n\n130\n00:08:04.741 --> 00:08:06.198\n>> Hm.\n\n131\n00:08:06.198 --> 00:08:08.500\n>> So, this is important in\ncountries that maybe have two, or\n\n132\n00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.258\npossibly more than two official languages.\n\n133\n00:08:10.258 --> 00:08:11.018\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n134\n00:08:11.018 --> 00:08:12.858\n>> Something to consider.\n\n135\n00:08:12.858 --> 00:08:16.700\nOkay, now you have the ability,\nagain, it's a manual process.\n\n136\n00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.858\nYou have the ability to suggest phrases.\n\n137\n00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.378\nThat can come from a text file.\n\n138\n00:08:24.378 --> 00:08:28.758\nYou can also have a list of phrases,\nwhich you will never suggest.\n\n139\n00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:33.398\nWhat, immediately comes to my mind is\nsome kind of religious terminology, or\n\n140\n00:08:33.398 --> 00:08:37.638\nsomething that might be considered\noffensive to some group of people.\n\n141\n00:08:37.638 --> 00:08:42.090\nSo again, a lot of what I'm\nshowing you today in this episode,\n\n142\n00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.895\nthese aren't things you do once and\nforget about it.\n\n143\n00:08:45.895 --> 00:08:50.450\nSo I often preach the value of\nhaving some kind of librarian rule.\n\n144\n00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.330\nI mean, there's literally\na masters in Library Science.\n\n145\n00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.790\nI'm not sure if there's a doctorate,\nbut that's such a necessary skill,\n\n146\n00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.655\nto be able to classify information\nin this age in which we live,\n\n147\n00:08:58.655 --> 00:09:00.188\nin which we're awash with data.\n\n148\n00:09:00.188 --> 00:09:05.780\nSo the point is, these are activities\nwhich will be iterative or ongoing.\n\n149\n00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.790\nAs users use the search functionality,\nand they give you feedback, good or\n\n150\n00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.950\nbad, then you can tweak.\n\n151\n00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.420\nAnd we'll keep looking at various ways we\ncan improve search results for our users.\n\n152\n00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:22.318\nSo there's the always and\nnever suggest phrases options.\n\n153\n00:09:22.318 --> 00:09:25.178\nAnd result sources.\n\n154\n00:09:25.178 --> 00:09:29.078\nSo this includes both local and\nexternal results.\n\n155\n00:09:29.078 --> 00:09:32.358\nOf course, they're going to mention\nBing there, not the other guys.\n\n156\n00:09:32.358 --> 00:09:34.918\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like Metacrawler.\n\n157\n00:09:34.918 --> 00:09:36.058\nAre they still around?\n\n158\n00:09:36.058 --> 00:09:36.938\nOr Dogpile?\n\n159\n00:09:36.938 --> 00:09:38.258\n>> Dogpile, yeah.\n\n160\n00:09:38.258 --> 00:09:39.338\nMy dad's favorite.\n\n161\n00:09:39.338 --> 00:09:42.294\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm dating myself.\n\n162\n00:09:42.294 --> 00:09:47.430\nOkay, so various results sources here, so\n\n163\n00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:52.030\nwe have things like conversations,\ndocuments,\n\n164\n00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:58.190\nlocal SharePoint results you'd expect,\npages, pictures, wikis.\n\n165\n00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:02.003\nSome organizations never use Wikis,\nothers do, if you think of Wikipedia,\n\n166\n00:10:02.003 --> 00:10:03.246\nthat's a good example.\n\n167\n00:10:03.246 --> 00:10:06.126\nI think wiki means quick in Hawaiian,\nor quick quick, or something.\n\n168\n00:10:06.126 --> 00:10:09.450\nSo that it's very easy to modify an entry.\n\n169\n00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:13.880\nSo that's good for maybe product\ndocumentation, or some internal testing.\n\n170\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.040\nJust a place to collaborate and\nmake instant changes.\n\n171\n00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.240\nOkay, so let's say I want to\nspecify a new result source.\n\n172\n00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.780\nLet's see what happens there.\n\n173\n00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.500\nHopefully not a broken link.\n\n174\n00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.199\nOkay so, here's we specify,\nwe give it a name and\n\n175\n00:10:31.199 --> 00:10:34.383\nthen a protocol is the result source,\n\n176\n00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:39.178\nlocally in SharePoint or\na remote SharePoint instance.\n\n177\n00:10:39.178 --> 00:10:42.467\nWe have the Opensearch1.0/1.1 protocols,\n\n178\n00:10:42.467 --> 00:10:45.838\nwe can connect a huge variety\nof data sources as well.\n\n179\n00:10:45.838 --> 00:10:52.830\nAnd there's also the Exchange public\nfolders for example, that data source.\n\n180\n00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:57.530\nOkay and\nthen do we wanna search over all kinds of\n\n181\n00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.640\nresults result sources or\njust restrict to people search?\n\n182\n00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:08.128\nNow, this is fascinating to me,\nyou can have a query transformed.\n\n183\n00:11:08.128 --> 00:11:13.259\nSo, in other words people might type in\na search phrase, like purple cakes and\n\n184\n00:11:13.259 --> 00:11:18.028\nthat gets transformed to something\nelse like magenta pie or something.\n\n185\n00:11:18.028 --> 00:11:19.308\nOkay that's ridiculous.\n\n186\n00:11:19.308 --> 00:11:22.028\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the point is we could take some\n\n187\n00:11:22.028 --> 00:11:26.793\nphrase, and based on our experience\nabout generating reports for query terms\n\n188\n00:11:26.793 --> 00:11:31.629\nwhich produce no results, we as the admin\ntype role or the librarian type role,\n\n189\n00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:35.920\nknow that when they enter this search\nterm, they actually mean this.\n\n190\n00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.310\nSo a better example is an old name for\na product.\n\n191\n00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.642\nWe've updated the name in\nour product catalog, but\n\n192\n00:11:41.642 --> 00:11:45.088\npeople still think about the old brand\nname, and they might search for that.\n\n193\n00:11:45.088 --> 00:11:49.661\nSo you could replace that old brand\nname with the current brand name for\n\n194\n00:11:49.661 --> 00:11:51.870\nthe same product.\n\n195\n00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:58.060\nSo that's kinda cool, and there's a link\nto learn more about query transform.\n\n196\n00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.570\nAnd it leads to online help, so\n\n197\n00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.370\ndefinitely take advantage of\nonline help when you can.\n\n198\n00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.488\nThere's also a Query Builder.\n\n199\n00:12:04.488 --> 00:12:10.088\nI can click on Launch Query Builder,\nand the screen grays out dramatically.\n\n200\n00:12:10.088 --> 00:12:11.088\n>> Blows up your machine, yeah.\n\n201\n00:12:11.088 --> 00:12:14.926\n[LAUGH]\n>> And then I can use things\n\n202\n00:12:14.926 --> 00:12:19.831\nlike Keyword Folder can be\nonly when returned sites or\n\n203\n00:12:19.831 --> 00:12:23.767\nuse the name of the user\nrunning the query.\n\n204\n00:12:23.767 --> 00:12:25.266\nI can add a keyword filter.\n\n205\n00:12:32.726 --> 00:12:38.831\nLet's see Property filters here,\nI can filter by Author, by File Type,\n\n206\n00:12:38.831 --> 00:12:44.149\nby Last Modified Time, and\nthen a boolean expression's here,\n\n207\n00:12:44.149 --> 00:12:47.610\nso Contains or Greater Than, Less Than.\n\n208\n00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:55.545\nIt could be within a certain\ndate range that I'm looking for,\n\n209\n00:12:55.545 --> 00:12:58.228\na value of field on the page.\n\n210\n00:12:58.228 --> 00:13:05.108\nOkay, and Credentials.\n\n211\n00:13:05.108 --> 00:13:09.777\nOkay, so,\nwe could use a Default Authentication to\n\n212\n00:13:09.777 --> 00:13:14.668\nconnect to a result source or\na Basic Authentication.\n\n213\n00:13:14.668 --> 00:13:19.238\nSo you might have different result\nsources requiring different\n\n214\n00:13:19.238 --> 00:13:21.868\ncredentials to crawl that content.\n\n215\n00:13:21.868 --> 00:13:22.842\nAnd there's support for\n\n216\n00:13:22.842 --> 00:13:25.768\nmultiple credentials depending on\nthe kinds of content we're crawling.\n\n217\n00:13:25.768 --> 00:13:30.852\nTypically finance or\nHR result sources require a password or\n\n218\n00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:37.548\nuser name password combo with more rights\nthan your standard crawler account.\n\n219\n00:13:37.548 --> 00:13:41.396\nOkay, and\n\n220\n00:13:41.396 --> 00:13:46.527\nlet's go back\n\n221\n00:13:46.527 --> 00:13:50.808\nto search.\n\n222\n00:13:50.808 --> 00:13:54.778\nSometimes the navigation doesn't work as\nexpected both on-prem and online, for\n\n223\n00:13:54.778 --> 00:13:57.384\nexample you cancel one window,\nyou expect to go back to\n\n224\n00:13:57.384 --> 00:14:01.088\nwhere you were exactly before, but no,\nit boots you out to some other place.\n\n225\n00:14:01.088 --> 00:14:03.526\nSo I guess it's just designed\nto keep you on your toes.\n\n226\n00:14:03.526 --> 00:14:05.847\nSo so far so good.\n\n227\n00:14:05.847 --> 00:14:09.086\n>> Those pages that are seldom visited,\nit tries to up their numbers.\n\n228\n00:14:09.086 --> 00:14:13.546\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, maybe, maybe, okay.\n\n229\n00:14:13.546 --> 00:14:16.166\nAnd let's look at\nmanaging query rules now.\n\n230\n00:14:20.146 --> 00:14:24.080\nOkay, so we can promote important results.\n\n231\n00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.240\nWe can tune ranking, so again,\n\n232\n00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.960\nit's often a manual process to tweak\nwhich results appear in which order.\n\n233\n00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.437\nGenerally, we wanna get results\non the first page where possible,\n\n234\n00:14:36.437 --> 00:14:38.766\nthe most relevant results\non the first page.\n\n235\n00:14:38.766 --> 00:14:42.498\nSo for result source, for\n\n236\n00:14:42.498 --> 00:14:46.741\nexample Pictures relating to\n\n237\n00:14:46.741 --> 00:14:52.460\nAll User Segments and All Topics.\n\n238\n00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:57.460\nThen I can enter a query rule, and\n\n239\n00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:03.810\npromote a certain result for\nthat particular context or item.\n\n240\n00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.100\nSo again we're tweaking,\nwe're improving or\n\n241\n00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.220\nincreasing the item in the results pages.\n\n242\n00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.220\nAnd let's look at query client types.\n\n243\n00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.590\nSo this we can prioritize\nquery throttling.\n\n244\n00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:30.740\nOkay, so we have system client types,\nthose are out of the box.\n\n245\n00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.928\nAnd we have various tiers of applications.\n\n246\n00:15:33.928 --> 00:15:40.430\nSo, let's say our resources are taxed.\n\n247\n00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:45.239\nThen we can prioritize which items\nget queried no matter what and\n\n248\n00:15:45.239 --> 00:15:50.866\nwhich items they prevent getting queried\nuntil a throttling is taken off.\n\n249\n00:15:50.866 --> 00:15:55.482\nSo we have various tiers here,\nsee throttling tier, so\n\n250\n00:15:55.482 --> 00:15:59.707\nAlerts are able to be queried,\nAllResultsQuery,\n\n251\n00:15:59.707 --> 00:16:04.443\nand any Custom System types\nthey're on the bottom tier.\n\n252\n00:16:04.443 --> 00:16:06.400\nMonitoring as well.\n\n253\n00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.770\nObject model.\n\n254\n00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.985\nSo in other words, not all content\nis indexable and queried equally.\n\n255\n00:16:11.985 --> 00:16:13.490\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n256\n00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:18.860\n>> We must prioritize workload,\nand that happens auto-magically.\n\n257\n00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.580\nOkay, now remove search results.\n\n258\n00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:26.740\nSometime, despite your best efforts,\nyou may have inadvertently\n\n259\n00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.020\nset incorrect permissions on a document,\nlike layoffs 2017.\n\n260\n00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.190\nThat tends to freak people out.\n\n261\n00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:35.200\nSo, you can certainly want\nto find the permissions.\n\n262\n00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.520\nBut sometimes the first thing you\nwanna do is just get that URL,\n\n263\n00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:43.340\nthe path of that document\nout of the index.\n\n264\n00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:48.100\nSo, we can do this by typing that\nURL in the URLs to remove section.\n\n265\n00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.240\nAnd as soon as I click on remove now for\nthat URL,\n\n266\n00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:56.370\nthat URL immediately disappears\nfrom any search results.\n\n267\n00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:00.840\nSo this is a thing to do immediately,\nthen you can go back and troubleshoot.\n\n268\n00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.870\nWhy some people that shouldn't have\nbeen able to see that document, for\n\n269\n00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.000\nexample, were.\n\n270\n00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.050\nAnd that could be to do with\ninheriting permissions or\n\n271\n00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:11.340\nmaybe there was some granular permission\nthat you set that was incorrect.\n\n272\n00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:15.690\nSo that's how you can\nsave yourself as it were.\n\n273\n00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:21.530\nSo, in terms of security through\nobscurity, it's another strategy some\n\n274\n00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:26.090\norganizations employ if the data is very\nsensitive, they don't index it at all.\n\n275\n00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:30.620\nIf it's not indexed, it can't be\nsearched for and discovered that way.\n\n276\n00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.820\nIt can be accessed other ways,\nfor example, maybe you email\n\n277\n00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.550\na link to the site to users that need it,\nmaybe they put it in their favorites.\n\n278\n00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.580\nBut they know that this is sensitive\ninformation, it's not indexed,\n\n279\n00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:42.620\nit's not searchable.\n\n280\n00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.130\nYou must access the content\nfrom this link, for example.\n\n281\n00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:47.940\nOkay.\n\n282\n00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.420\nLet's look at usage reports now.\n\n283\n00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:56.667\nSo there's a variety of built in reports,\n\n284\n00:17:56.667 --> 00:17:59.303\na number of queries.\n\n285\n00:18:02.454 --> 00:18:05.140\nSo we can look at, something went wrong.\n\n286\n00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:05.900\nNo data, okay.\n\n287\n00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.130\nSometimes it looks like an error page but\nreally it has no data,\n\n288\n00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.910\nnobody queried anything.\n\n289\n00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:10.980\nOkay, that's too bad.\n\n290\n00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.230\nOne of the reasons you'd want to\nknow about the number of queries.\n\n291\n00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.890\nYou can see peak times of day\nwhen most queries occurred.\n\n292\n00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.310\nAnd the people were getting slow search\nresults, for example, or slow to load,\n\n293\n00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.980\nthen you could maybe look at that\nin terms of allocating resources.\n\n294\n00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.960\nTop queries of the day, I wonder if\nthese are all going to error out now.\n\n295\n00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.690\nWe're about to find out.\n\n296\n00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:34.190\nGood.\n\n297\n00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:35.840\nThat's gonna work.\n\n298\n00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.340\nGood to know what users are searching for.\n\n299\n00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:46.950\nSo it's an excel spreadsheet here,\nand I'll enable editing,\n\n300\n00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:52.260\nso there's you know by date each\ntab each date his it's own tab.\n\n301\n00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:59.060\nAnd we can sort and\nfilter by result source, by query text,\n\n302\n00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.140\nby total queries, percent of all queries.\n\n303\n00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.330\nSo, if you're used to sorting data in\nexcel, this is exactly what you do.\n\n304\n00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.710\nSo, it's very important to know\nwhat users are searching for.\n\n305\n00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:08.780\nWhy are they searching?\n\n306\n00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.490\nIs it because they couldn't find it?\n\n307\n00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.900\nThere was no shortcut?\n\n308\n00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.850\nOr navigation is difficult,\nmaybe they've given up\n\n309\n00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:19.230\non navigating the content because\nmaybe your pages are too cluttered or\n\n310\n00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:24.420\nit's not operationally not organized\neffectively so they're relying on search.\n\n311\n00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.000\nSo by looking at the top queries of\nthe day report, you can get a lot of\n\n312\n00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.530\ninformation which will help tune\nyour SharePoint environment.\n\n313\n00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.455\nSimilarly top queries by a month okay.\n\n314\n00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:37.760\nThis is good.\n\n315\n00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.160\nNow you might think it's negative, but\n\n316\n00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.950\nno we want to find out things\nlike abandoned queries by day.\n\n317\n00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:47.230\nIt's like an abandoned shopping cart\nall lonely there in internet land.\n\n318\n00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:52.660\nSo this means the search was executed.\n\n319\n00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:56.500\nAnd then the search results appeared,\nnone of them were clicked on.\n\n320\n00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.750\nSome of the words, whatever they\nare querying for either doesn't exist or\n\n321\n00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:04.220\nthey couldn't access it with\nthe terms they were using.\n\n322\n00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.210\nSo that's considered an abandoned query.\n\n323\n00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:10.214\nSo then we,\nour task becomes as search administrators,\n\n324\n00:20:10.214 --> 00:20:12.790\nhow can we make that\ncontent more discoverable?\n\n325\n00:20:14.181 --> 00:20:16.640\nHow can we improve that discoverability?\n\n326\n00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:21.740\nAgain, navigation, so\nlinks on the top bar or\n\n327\n00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.780\non the left hand side, the quick launch.\n\n328\n00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:28.695\nThere's a variety of ways of\nexposing that information and\n\n329\n00:20:28.695 --> 00:20:31.033\nwhere the content actually lives.\n\n330\n00:20:33.798 --> 00:20:35.300\nSo, then, it queries by month.\n\n331\n00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.830\nSame thing on a monthly scale.\n\n332\n00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.270\nAlso useful, the no query results by date.\n\n333\n00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:44.260\nObviously, they were looking for\nsomething, unless it was some\n\n334\n00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.200\nobvious spelling mistake or something,\nwhich, even then, can be corrected for.\n\n335\n00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.450\nBut let's say there's a valid\nsearch phrase, a word.\n\n336\n00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.880\nOr produced no results.\n\n337\n00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.930\nWell it's good to think okay,\nwhat were they looking for?\n\n338\n00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:57.560\nSometimes you have to\nbe a bit of a sleuth.\n\n339\n00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.830\nWhat were they looking for\nthat they received no results?\n\n340\n00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:05.990\nCan I manually add suggested results,\nsuggested terms?\n\n341\n00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.580\nThe links for them.\n\n342\n00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.940\nNo results queries by month.\n\n343\n00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:12.440\nOkay.\n\n344\n00:21:14.808 --> 00:21:18.008\nThat's all I've go there.\n\n345\n00:21:18.008 --> 00:21:19.447\nLet's go back here now.\n\n346\n00:21:22.396 --> 00:21:26.620\nOkay, now Search Center settings.\n\n347\n00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:35.171\nAll right, so typically,\nyou'll have a global search center and you\n\n348\n00:21:35.171 --> 00:21:41.153\ncould specify the URL, which by default is\nin the search center URL path right now.\n\n349\n00:21:43.164 --> 00:21:46.070\nYou may wanna set a different URL for\nthe search center.\n\n350\n00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:50.290\nNow, the search center itself is very\ncustomizable, that's a beautiful thing.\n\n351\n00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:57.350\nSo, you might have four different search\nengines in use for a given query.\n\n352\n00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.100\nAnd maybe the results then get\ndisplayed in quadrants, so\n\n353\n00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.270\nyou've got four quarter pages of results.\n\n354\n00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:08.440\nAnd you can say, okay, if this word or\nphrase appears in the search terms,\n\n355\n00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.420\nthen use this search engine\nto process the query.\n\n356\n00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.880\nFor example, if you're a legal firm,\nyou go LexisNexis.\n\n357\n00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.250\nYou might wanna send it to.\n\n358\n00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:19.530\nYou might have some reason to send\ncertain searches to Google or\n\n359\n00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:22.610\nYahoo or Bing for example.\n\n360\n00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.720\nSo, you're not limited to\njust a single search engine.\n\n361\n00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:30.070\nYou could leverage the power of multiple\nsearch engines at the same time for\n\n362\n00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:35.450\nthe same query or direct individual\nqueries to, say, a single search engine.\n\n363\n00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.280\nDepending on rules you set up.\n\n364\n00:22:44.964 --> 00:22:47.858\nOkay, now, export search configuration,\n\n365\n00:22:47.858 --> 00:22:52.734\nmaybe you've got a different division\nwith a separate SharePoint farm, so\n\n366\n00:22:52.734 --> 00:22:57.915\nyou're able to export settings regarding\nthings like customized query rules,\n\n367\n00:22:57.915 --> 00:23:02.180\nresults sources, and then other\ntenants can leverage that export\n\n368\n00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:06.400\nsearch configuration or\nthe search in a range could be exported.\n\n369\n00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.880\nOn the flip side of that,\nyou can import a search\n\n370\n00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.220\nconfiguration that's already\nbeen set up on another farm.\n\n371\n00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.520\nCrawl log permissions.\n\n372\n00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.790\nVery important.\n\n373\n00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:20.880\nIf we don't have permissions for\nthe content,\n\n374\n00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:27.100\nthen the crawler cannot index the content\nand make it available for search results.\n\n375\n00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:33.700\nYou might have a dedicated machine on\nprem, for example, to be a crawler.\n\n376\n00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.740\nMaybe more than one machine on\nprem you might be familiar with,\n\n377\n00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.720\ndepending on the volume of content you\nhave to crawl and how often it changes.\n\n378\n00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.020\nNow let's say you have\nan initial deployment and\n\n379\n00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.890\nyou have a lot of information to crawl.\n\n380\n00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.650\nThat's gonna take\na significant amount of time.\n\n381\n00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.730\nPotentially months to crawl that content.\n\n382\n00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:50.380\nEspecially, let's say,\n\n383\n00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.940\nI always like to use the example of a law\nfirm that's 100 years old, and on this\n\n384\n00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:58.020\nproject to digitize all your case files,\nand that's millions of pages, right?\n\n385\n00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.510\nSo the initial crawl is\ngonna take a long time.\n\n386\n00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.500\nSo you might want to allocate\na lot of resource to do that,\n\n387\n00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.370\ndepending on how many\nmonths you have to crawl.\n\n388\n00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:10.878\nThereafter the amount of new data incoming\nhas to be crawled that has changed or\n\n389\n00:24:10.878 --> 00:24:15.810\nis new is far less than all the historical\ndata you may choose to crawl.\n\n390\n00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:24.191\nCrawl log account or accounts need\nthe correct permissions to access\n\n391\n00:24:24.191 --> 00:24:26.698\nthe content that needs to be indexed.\n\n392\n00:24:30.681 --> 00:24:33.560\nAnd that's what I have for search admin.\n\n393\n00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.460\n>> All right, well I tell you,\na lot of great information there.\n\n394\n00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.560\nAgain, as we've said, now several times.\n\n395\n00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.230\nA lot of, there's a lot of importance\nto getting search set up right.\n\n396\n00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:46.520\nWe want people to use, and\nuse successfully, our SharePoint,\n\n397\n00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.950\nwhether it's on premise,\nor out there in the cloud.\n\n398\n00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:50.090\nAnd here, we're taking a look at, again,\n\n399\n00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:54.380\nat the setting up that search engine for\nour cloud based solution with share point.\n\n400\n00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.870\nWe appreciate that, Mark,\nsome great demonstrations there.\n\n401\n00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.644\nHope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n402\n00:24:58.644 --> 00:25:00.711\nSigning off

00:00:15.374\nat ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.374 --> 00:00:16.535\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:19.650\nToday we're doing SharePoint 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.150\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.080\nwe're gonna take a look at how we\ncan integrate SharePoint online with\n\n8\n00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.520\nseveral other supporting technologies\nlike OneDrive and Yammer and\n\n9\n00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.110\nsome of our other ones that Mark has kind\nof alluded to in the past few episodes.\n\n10\n00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.040\nAnd now we're gonna take\na closer look at them.\n\n11\n00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.060\nSo here to help us, of course, is Mr.\nMark Ingram, how's it going Mark?\n\n12\n00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.690\n>> Thanks Mike.\n\n13\n00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.244\nYeah, great to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:40.244 --> 00:00:45.731\nSo these days as an admin does\nit really make sense to isolate\n\n15\n00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:53.657\nyour SharePoint online deployment from\nExchange online, Link online, OneDrive?\n\n16\n00:00:53.657 --> 00:00:55.259\n>> Not really cuz we\nwanna be able to search.\n\n17\n00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:58.464\nAlot of information might be stored\nin those different technologies and\n\n18\n00:00:58.464 --> 00:01:01.890\nBeing able to go to one place is really\nwhat SharePoint's all about, right?\n\n19\n00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.590\nIs that, that one stop shop.\n\n20\n00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.760\n>> Right, and also to be able to monitor\nfunctionality, again, SharePoint,\n\n21\n00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.270\nwe've talked about alerts which depends\non a functional email environment, so\n\n22\n00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.390\nif your Exchange online is down,\nalerts aren't gonna get through, so.\n\n23\n00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.620\nThey really give you tools Microsoft\ndoes now to monitor and find out errors.\n\n24\n00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.528\nMaybe you are the SharePoint guru, you\nstill need to know about availability in\n\n25\n00:01:26.528 --> 00:01:29.840\nup time of Link, Exchange,\nOneDrive, and others.\n\n26\n00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.850\nKeep in mind there is\na 99.9 % up time guarantee,\n\n27\n00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.250\nin many cases which means\nit's gonna be some downtime.\n\n28\n00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.790\nAnd we looked earlier in another\nepisode at where to check for\n\n29\n00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.150\nhealth alerts to dashboards.\n\n30\n00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.800\nSo Microsoft makes it easy to know\nwhen a service is up or down.\n\n31\n00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.360\nAnd you can actually go beyond that to all\nthe different regions around the world,\n\n32\n00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.360\nthere's several, there's US West, US East\nother Cloud locations around the world.\n\n33\n00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.760\nSo, especially if you're\nan international organization,\n\n34\n00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.240\nyou can see the health and\nreplication health and know why maybe\n\n35\n00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.140\na particular document is not available\nin your immediate region, for example.\n\n36\n00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.030\nSo, it's a great time to be in IT.\n\n37\n00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.950\nLots of technologies\nrelating to one another.\n\n38\n00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.970\nLet's take a look at some of those.\n\n39\n00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.410\nSo I'll go into my waffle here.\n\n40\n00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.440\nIt actually has a proper name.\n\n41\n00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.830\nBut I like using the waffle.\n\n42\n00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.570\nSo I'll keep using that.\n\n43\n00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.228\n>> I like it too.\n\n44\n00:02:18.228 --> 00:02:19.120\n>> Let's go to Yammer.\n\n45\n00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.450\nLet's start with OneDrive actually.\n\n46\n00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.730\nOneDrive first, and this will populate.\n\n47\n00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.590\nSo it's a useful storage location\nto collaborate in the cloud.\n\n48\n00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.250\nI randomly uploaded\na picture the other day.\n\n49\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.640\nAnd notice now,\nlet's check out what we can do with that.\n\n50\n00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.090\nSo through the ellipses,\nthe context menu here,\n\n51\n00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.160\nI can get a link so\nI can share a link to that document.\n\n52\n00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.740\nI can move or copy it, I can even\nhave version history, I can share it.\n\n53\n00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.150\nSo as you'd expect just because\nyou're hosting content in OneDrive,\n\n54\n00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.870\nyou still have full control over who\ngets to see it and what they can do.\n\n55\n00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.000\nMaybe you just wanna give read\naccess to certain people.\n\n56\n00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.110\nOther people should be allowed to edit,\ndelete, etc.\n\n57\n00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.080\nSo here's the Get a Link.\n\n58\n00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.040\nSo again, it's not like Microsoft\nhas a monopoly on this technology.\n\n59\n00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.330\nIf you use Dropbox or\nother sharing tools like Hightail.\n\n60\n00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.300\nYou'll be familiar with\nthe general concepts.\n\n61\n00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.845\nAll right, so well, let's look at\nthis picture, I'm curious too.\n\n62\n00:03:17.845 --> 00:03:19.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so there's.\n\n63\n00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.030\n>> I thought I was gonna ask if it\nwas you in your old rocking days.\n\n64\n00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.190\n>> That's not me, I will be extremely\nvain, there's enough vanity in the world.\n\n65\n00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.210\nThis is a squash league meeting.\n\n66\n00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.640\nFascinating!\n\n67\n00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.990\n>> Very cool.\n>> That's not me at the podium.\n\n68\n00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.530\nThere are various tools\nhere on the ribbon and\n\n69\n00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.620\nI can see now at a glance\nthat sharing is for only me.\n\n70\n00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.008\nThere's a song about that too.\n\n71\n00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:46.976\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Which I won't sing that\n\n72\n00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:47.750\nfor you.\n\n73\n00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.070\nSo I go under the advanced here.\n\n74\n00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.010\nAnd okay,\nlimited access usually on the site and\n\n75\n00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.480\ndocuments and permissions inheritance,\nwe covered that in another episode.\n\n76\n00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.200\nThe ability to divorce inheritance\nif you like from the parent and\n\n77\n00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.880\nestablish permissions for that particular\ndocument or any child objects below.\n\n78\n00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.220\nSo we won't go over that again,\nbecause we covered that.\n\n79\n00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.920\nBut the principles apply\nin OneDrive as well.\n\n80\n00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.340\nSo what is the benefit\nof OneDrive storage?\n\n81\n00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.750\nWell if you're like me and you might\nhave more than one device you use and\n\n82\n00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.290\nmaybe you travel,\nmaybe you're concerned, okay,\n\n83\n00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.230\nit's definitely gonna impact my\nlife if I lose the hardware.\n\n84\n00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.630\nIt'd be a hassle to replace and\nmaybe configure that new laptop or\n\n85\n00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.530\ntablet device the way I wanted it, but\n\n86\n00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.190\nthe content the data on the device\ncould be really expensive to replace or\n\n87\n00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.430\nthey might expose me to liability,\nfor customer information for example.\n\n88\n00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.290\nSo I've started recently using\ncloud storage as a go to mechanism,\n\n89\n00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.650\nespecially for collaborative documents.\n\n90\n00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.400\nThat way it does give me more\npiece of mind, I must say.\n\n91\n00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.290\nIt's not like I cavalierly leave\nmy laptops out in plain sight and\n\n92\n00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.945\nwander away, sometimes,\nbut only at Starbucks.\n\n93\n00:05:04.945 --> 00:05:08.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But this gives me peace of mind knowing\n\n94\n00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.180\nthat the most valuable portion\nof what's on my devices is data\n\n95\n00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.630\nitself and I've got confidence now that\nit's in the cloud, it's backed up.\n\n96\n00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.380\nNow whether or\nnot the government can access it,\n\n97\n00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.080\nI just assume there's all\nkinds of access there.\n\n98\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.880\n>> Most likely right.\n\n99\n00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.590\nYeah.\n>> That's right.\n\n100\n00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.600\nI just assume everything is hackable or\ndiscoverable by NSA.\n\n101\n00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.320\nMicrosoft's in the news for\nsomething regarding, yeah,\n\n102\n00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.760\nwanting to be notified when\ncustomer data has been exposed.\n\n103\n00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.110\nSo, that'll be an ongoing battle.\n\n104\n00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.790\nBut for my money,\nthe benefits of cloud storage and\n\n105\n00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.620\naccessible storage from any platform, any\ndevice, from anywhere in the world with\n\n106\n00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.850\nInternet connection,\nthose are compelling advantages.\n\n107\n00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.020\n>> Absolutely and very similar in\nconcept to SharePoint in the fact that\n\n108\n00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.010\nI've got one copy of\nthat information out too.\n\n109\n00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.940\nWhereas when I was copying\nonto thumbdrives and\n\n110\n00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.010\nharddrives, taking it home to work on.\n\n111\n00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.620\nRemembering to copy the modified version\n\n112\n00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.820\nback to the thumb drive\nto bring back to work.\n\n113\n00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.670\nNone of that anymore,\n\n114\n00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.850\nI get to work I'm working with the same\ncopy that I work with at home.\n\n115\n00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.470\nOr if I'm traveling down south to present\nsome information down there at a class,\n\n116\n00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.300\nyou know I've got that same information.\n\n117\n00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.100\nSo it's a fantastic solution.\n\n118\n00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.880\n>> And that's, you're just talking about\ncollaborating with yourself, essentially.\n\n119\n00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.777\n>> Yes.\n>> Imagine what would happen if\n\n120\n00:06:19.777 --> 00:06:20.830\nyou got other people in the loop here.\n\n121\n00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.530\nEmailing different copies and\nversions and someone left it at work,\n\n122\n00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.140\ncan you please email a previous copy.\n\n123\n00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.910\nIt's a Gong Show.\n\n124\n00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.790\nSo we have proper versioning.\n\n125\n00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.810\nIt's one of the things,\nactually, we'll cover that.\n\n126\n00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.637\nIt's important that as site admins,\n\n127\n00:06:33.637 --> 00:06:38.110\nand farm admins that we do know about\nversioning and document sharing.\n\n128\n00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:43.050\nSo we'll look at the check out and\ncheck in permission in another episode.\n\n129\n00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.050\nHere's where I can also stop sharing and\n\n130\n00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.460\nI can invite people and\nthen it's very basic.\n\n131\n00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.890\nFor me, it's not gonna require\na lot of end user training.\n\n132\n00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.900\nEither the people I invite can read or\nthey can add it.\n\n133\n00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.990\n>> Basic enough.\n\n134\n00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.770\n>> Very basic.\n\n135\n00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.630\nThen, are they required to sign in?\n\n136\n00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.710\nShould I send an email invitation?\n\n137\n00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.600\nSo, that is OneDrive.\n\n138\n00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.520\nNow, actually,\nI can use the waffle right from here.\n\n139\n00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.270\nLet's go into Yammer.\n\n140\n00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:18.905\n>> Woo!!\n>> Exciting times.\n\n141\n00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:20.880\n>> I know you like your Yammer.\n\n142\n00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.770\n>> Yammer time.\n\n143\n00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.440\n>> That's what it is.\n\n144\n00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.990\nYou like the name.\n\n145\n00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.310\n>> I do like saying it.\n\n146\n00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.220\nThis is true.\n\n147\n00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.110\nWhat was his big hit?\n\n148\n00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.860\nM C Hammer.\n\n149\n00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:31.490\n>> Hammer time?\n\n150\n00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.530\nWas that what it was called?\n\n151\n00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:33.690\n>> I can't remember.\n\n152\n00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.790\nI just remember those baggy pants.\n\n153\n00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.380\n>> We're dating ourselves.\n\n154\n00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.010\n>> So this is It's kind of cool how\nMicrosoft actually used employees.\n\n155\n00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.440\nOr at least they were employees.\n\n156\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.751\nI actually looked up one of these\nemployees just to see if they're legit.\n\n157\n00:07:46.751 --> 00:07:48.004\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They moved on.\n\n158\n00:07:48.004 --> 00:07:50.323\nBut they were actually with Microsoft, so.\n\n159\n00:07:50.323 --> 00:07:53.720\n>> This is pre-populated data,\njust to get you used to the interface.\n\n160\n00:07:53.720 --> 00:08:00.072\nSo if you've used Facebook or LinkedIn,\nthese won't be confusing concepts.\n\n161\n00:08:00.072 --> 00:08:02.941\nSo think of Yammer as Facebook for\nyour organization.\n\n162\n00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:05.295\nNow, frankly, adoption has been mixed.\n\n163\n00:08:05.295 --> 00:08:08.461\nSome people swear by it, others, meh.\n\n164\n00:08:08.461 --> 00:08:12.010\nOr they try it and\nthey move on to other collaboration tools.\n\n165\n00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.060\nAnd a lot of functionality is\ncovered in other, Link, for example,\n\n166\n00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.040\nyou can see presence awareness.\n\n167\n00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.880\nWell, here's our Yammer.\n\n168\n00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.590\nWe got Allie Bellew and Belinda and\nGarth, and other people.\n\n169\n00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.370\nI can minimize that.\n\n170\n00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:28.345\nAnd this is, I find, extremely useful at\ngetting people to take full advantage and\n\n171\n00:08:28.345 --> 00:08:31.275\nhelp other people by\nfilling out their profile.\n\n172\n00:08:31.275 --> 00:08:34.854\nWe got a percent complete, so in the upper\nright here it says getting started.\n\n173\n00:08:34.854 --> 00:08:38.440\nAnd then I can follow my co-workers or\ncolleagues,\n\n174\n00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.100\nI can get the application,\nand the mobile app.\n\n175\n00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:47.170\nSo the status update in Facebook is the,\nwhat are you working on, internally.\n\n176\n00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.440\nAnd I can do a little poll, I can praise,\n\n177\n00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.960\na little trophy there,\nI can make an announcement.\n\n178\n00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:01.010\nAnd there's certainly hashtagging\navailable, and then replying and sharing.\n\n179\n00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.100\nOther options here from the ellipses.\n\n180\n00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.480\nI can hide the conversation,\nI can bookmark it.\n\n181\n00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.460\nSo it's fun to explore around.\n\n182\n00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:17.260\nYou can set up alerts, you can upload\nfiles, so lots to do in the Yammer space.\n\n183\n00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.380\nAnd then, again, we want information\ncoming to us that's relevant.\n\n184\n00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.290\nSo we can tailor and\n\n185\n00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.200\nshape what information shows\nup in our Yammer environment.\n\n186\n00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.035\nSo this is useful, I might wanna know,\nthere's new apps in the App Directory.\n\n187\n00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:31.380\nHm, I wonder what those\nfive featured apps are.\n\n188\n00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.580\nMaybe one of them is useful for\nme, I'll check that out.\n\n189\n00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.447\nSuggested people, so again I don't\nhave to search through hundreds or\n\n190\n00:09:37.447 --> 00:09:40.268\npotentially thousands of employees\ninternally, thinking, okay,\n\n191\n00:09:40.268 --> 00:09:42.484\nwell, I might be on\nthe collaborate with this person.\n\n192\n00:09:42.484 --> 00:09:45.038\nNo, who's got time for that?\n\n193\n00:09:45.038 --> 00:09:45.990\nAin't nobody got time for that.\n\n194\n00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So this is suggested people.\n\n195\n00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.162\nNow these suggestions\naren't pulled out of a hat,\n\n196\n00:09:52.162 --> 00:09:56.420\nthis also integrates with an underlying\nMicrosoft graph API, which is,\n\n197\n00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.491\nremember a way of creating associations\nand making them meaningful.\n\n198\n00:10:00.491 --> 00:10:07.569\nSo, suggested people, again, they're\ngonna be related somehow to my job title,\n\n199\n00:10:07.569 --> 00:10:12.853\nto documents or projects I've\nworked on with certain people,\n\n200\n00:10:12.853 --> 00:10:15.964\npeople I know that know this person.\n\n201\n00:10:15.964 --> 00:10:20.631\nSo just like Facebook comes up with\nsuggestions and LinkedIn comes up with\n\n202\n00:10:20.631 --> 00:10:25.825\nsuggested connections, it's based on\nwhat you do, information you've shared\n\n203\n00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:30.964\nabout yourself, like your job title,\nprevious work experience, alma mater.\n\n204\n00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:31.926\nReally anything,\n\n205\n00:10:31.926 --> 00:10:36.071\nany information you choose to expose could\nbe used to calculate relevance of other\n\n206\n00:10:36.071 --> 00:10:39.449\npeople that should be somehow\nconnected to you in your work world.\n\n207\n00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.790\nPerhaps it's someone with\nthe same job title as you in\n\n208\n00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.840\na different division of the top company or\na different geographic area.\n\n209\n00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.810\nSimilarly, there are groups, again,\n\n210\n00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:53.870\nit's your social media experience, this\nwon't be a big learning curve for you.\n\n211\n00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:59.110\nBy joining a group, or requesting to\njoin a group, I'll join sales here.\n\n212\n00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.180\nThat was easy, so\n\n213\n00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.050\nthere was no moderator, no requirement\nthat somebody approve my request.\n\n214\n00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.135\nI wouldn't want to belong to any\ngroup that would have me as a member.\n\n215\n00:11:06.135 --> 00:11:08.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Was that Groucho Marx?\n\n216\n00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.680\n>> I think so [LAUGH]\n>> Someone, yeah, anyway.\n\n217\n00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.520\nOkay I do, I take it back, I wannna be in\nthe sales group, operations not so much.\n\n218\n00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.000\nSo let's say I have no interest in\noperations for whatever reason,\n\n219\n00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.160\nI can click the ellipsis and\nremove the suggestion.\n\n220\n00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:26.780\nSo now I've just trained Yammer\na little bit on what information and\n\n221\n00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.630\npeople and groups are of interest to me.\n\n222\n00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.390\nSo it's good to say yes and also no.\n\n223\n00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:35.190\nBy saying no to certain things and people\nand yes to certain groups of people,\n\n224\n00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.232\nI am shaping the content that's\ncoming to me in my Yammer feed.\n\n225\n00:11:38.232 --> 00:11:43.230\nAgain, there's a tidal wave of\ninformation we can customize,\n\n226\n00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.780\nand get more and more relevant\ninformation, which really maximizes our\n\n227\n00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.589\ntime regardless of when we're looking\nat this app, and on what device.\n\n228\n00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.640\nCompany resources which I can\nmake available and accessible for\n\n229\n00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.890\nthe entire network.\n\n230\n00:11:58.890 --> 00:11:59.928\nWhy?\nBecause I'm a network admin.\n\n231\n00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:03.647\nSo, again, just like in SharePoint,\nwe talk about SharePoint designer,\n\n232\n00:12:03.647 --> 00:12:07.207\nvery few people should have access\nto change the look and feel on-prem.\n\n233\n00:12:07.207 --> 00:12:10.314\nWell, similarly,\nwe can't have everyone and\n\n234\n00:12:10.314 --> 00:12:14.320\ntheir dog populating common pages or\nelements of a page.\n\n235\n00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.985\nThat just becomes useless and then you\nstart getting Candy Crush game requests.\n\n236\n00:12:17.985 --> 00:12:20.118\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then you block people.\n\n237\n00:12:20.118 --> 00:12:24.149\nOkay, by the way, backing up a little\nbit regarding look and feel,\n\n238\n00:12:24.149 --> 00:12:28.770\nyou may have noticed how vanilla it is\nin the SharePoint online environment.\n\n239\n00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:32.900\nThat's by design, remember Microsoft\nis essentially the farm admin.\n\n240\n00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:39.090\nSo, they prefer that you stick\nwith a generic or vanilla layout,\n\n241\n00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:43.300\nas opposed to getting crazy with color\nschemes, just for the overall functioning\n\n242\n00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.018\nof your tenants and their ability to\nadminister your farm environment.\n\n243\n00:12:47.018 --> 00:12:53.770\nOkay, so, I've clicked on\nthe settings button next to my name.\n\n244\n00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:59.190\nNow, I'm not sure who that background is,\nit used to be an outline of Bill Gates.\n\n245\n00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:03.171\nAnd then Zuckerberg, as well, on Facebook,\nwhen he didn't have a profile picture.\n\n246\n00:13:03.171 --> 00:13:05.665\nIt was the Bill Gates mugshot from,\nI think it was,\n\n247\n00:13:05.665 --> 00:13:07.236\nwas it Arizona he was living in?\n\n248\n00:13:07.236 --> 00:13:09.250\n>> I remember that, yes, uh-huh.\n>> Or New Mexico, Albuqurque?\n\n249\n00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:13.330\nSo there's a police mugshot, and it was\nthe outline of Bill Gates back in the day.\n\n250\n00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.466\nMemories, okay, so\nfrom here I can view my profile.\n\n251\n00:13:20.104 --> 00:13:21.640\nIn Yammer.\n\n252\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:27.550\nAnd, cool, so this did automatically,\n\n253\n00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:33.600\nadmin, that's me or my role, has joined,\n#joined, the domain name here and network.\n\n254\n00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.000\nTake a moment to welcome Mark.\n\n255\n00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.826\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think I'll welcome myself.\n\n256\n00:13:37.988 --> 00:13:40.900\nWelcome, Mark.\n\n257\n00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.100\nAnd notice how I could tag myself, there.\n\n258\n00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:44.632\n>> Nice.\n\n259\n00:13:44.632 --> 00:13:46.680\n>> Which is sort of redundant,\nbut you get the idea, right?\n\n260\n00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.450\nSo, again, just like Facebook,\na tag name appears in,\n\n261\n00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.170\nI guess, it's a slate blue,\nhighlighted background.\n\n262\n00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.230\nI could also notify more people.\n\n263\n00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:55.940\nI can tell Allie.\n\n264\n00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.735\nHopefully, she doesn't\nactually get these things.\n\n265\n00:13:57.735 --> 00:13:58.675\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Can you imagine?\n\n266\n00:13:58.675 --> 00:14:01.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If these got forwarded on from\n\n267\n00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:02.635\nhundreds of thousands.\n\n268\n00:14:02.635 --> 00:14:04.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, we're getting loopy.\n\n269\n00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:05.250\nLoopy.\n\n270\n00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.867\nAnd so there I've welcomed myself,\nvanity again.\n\n271\n00:14:09.867 --> 00:14:12.259\nNow this is cool, I can download a vCard.\n\n272\n00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.690\nIf I was looking at another user\nthat would make sense, right, so\n\n273\n00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.510\nit'd populate my address book and things.\n\n274\n00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:21.830\nHere's sections for files, images,\n\n275\n00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:26.845\nvideos, which reminds me we've got more\nto cover in these related technologies.\n\n276\n00:14:26.845 --> 00:14:29.120\nGotta watch the time here,\ndon't want to run over time.\n\n277\n00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.850\nOkay, and, yeah.\n\n278\n00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.890\nI'd previously joined\nthe after hours group, ooh.\n\n279\n00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.890\n>> Interesting.\n\n280\n00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.790\n>> Its really nice, though,\na product like Yammer,\n\n281\n00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.720\ncuz our users are already familiar,\nas you said,\n\n282\n00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.340\nwith things like Facebook and\nsocial media, and that interaction is big.\n\n283\n00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.870\nEverybody seems to really enjoy that\nkinda thing, so now we've got a way to\n\n284\n00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.490\nput that in our business environment,\nisolate it from the public,\n\n285\n00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.380\nif we choose to do so, so\nit's completely internal if we want.\n\n286\n00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.400\nYet, give them that same look and feel and\n\n287\n00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.570\nso, it's much more likely that\nthey'll adopt that technology.\n\n288\n00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.090\nWhere you throw something that's new and\n\n289\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.220\ndifferent, sometimes you have\nthat problem of user buy-in.\n\n290\n00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.550\nSomething like Yammer,\nthey're gonna be like, this is great,\n\n291\n00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.150\nthis is just like Facebook except for\nour company.\n\n292\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.860\nWell, yeah, cuz that's exactly what it is.\n\n293\n00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.150\n>> Good point, and it's fun, too.\n\n294\n00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:23.620\nPeople like being social, many people do,\nand so it's a fun thing to play in.\n\n295\n00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.410\nSo here's an example, scrolling down here,\nhow easy it is to create a survey.\n\n296\n00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.530\nAnd someone just created a a survey there,\n\n297\n00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.760\nwhat did someone think of\nthe Contoso community volunteer day?\n\n298\n00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.178\nNow, it's okay to use Contoso here\nbecause it's a Microsoft online property.\n\n299\n00:15:37.178 --> 00:15:41.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So there, sue me not, ha.\n\n300\n00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.030\nOkay, so other information there.\n\n301\n00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.510\nSome of these names you might remember,\nactually,\n\n302\n00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.080\nfrom other courses cuz\nthey tend to get reused.\n\n303\n00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.739\nOkay, what else do I wanna show you here?\n\n304\n00:15:52.739 --> 00:15:55.450\nGet support.\n\n305\n00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.576\nI love it when you get an error message\nsaying contact your network admin, and\n\n306\n00:15:58.576 --> 00:15:59.744\nyou're the network admin.\n\n307\n00:15:59.744 --> 00:16:00.333\nNot helpful.\n\n308\n00:16:00.333 --> 00:16:00.943\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n309\n00:16:00.943 --> 00:16:04.553\nthere's Yammer support\ninformation Admin center.\n\n310\n00:16:04.553 --> 00:16:10.850\nSo a dizzying array of support options,\nforums, Wikis, troubleshooting steps.\n\n311\n00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.150\nThat's enough of Yammer.\n\n312\n00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:14.040\nWe're moving on.\n\n313\n00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:16.190\nOkay.\n\n314\n00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:21.410\nSo next stop, let us look at Delve.\n\n315\n00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:23.780\nThis is another technology\nyou may not have heard of.\n\n316\n00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.490\nIt leverages the Microsoft graphs,\nthat API,\n\n317\n00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:30.410\nto connect everyone to everything,\nand make relevant associations.\n\n318\n00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.790\nSo there's not a lot going on here in\nmy environment, so thankfully there's\n\n319\n00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:38.790\nan opening video, and again,\nover time based on my usage patterns,\n\n320\n00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:43.020\nwho I interact with,\ndocuments I work with, sites I favorite.\n\n321\n00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:48.750\nMy usage patterns within SharePoint,\nit will expose more and more content\n\n322\n00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:53.370\nin these interfaces, of information that's\nrelevant to me, in a timely fashion.\n\n323\n00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:58.660\nSo items I've favorited, for example, will\nshow up here in one place, so that's cool.\n\n324\n00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.060\nSo I might be working around my\nSharePoint environment and favorite or\n\n325\n00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.502\nlike certain objects, but\nI couldn't possibly remember where I went.\n\n326\n00:17:05.502 --> 00:17:08.940\nWhich document library, or\nwhich user's site or my site was it on.\n\n327\n00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.970\nAnd I thought, if you're like me,\nsometimes I like or favorite something\n\n328\n00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:16.440\njust because I want to refer to it later,\nor save it in Facebook for example.\n\n329\n00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.330\nSo then I end up with\na whole bunch of saved links.\n\n330\n00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.000\nBut at least they exist somewhere.\n\n331\n00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.230\nAnd that somewhere in Delve is right\nhere on this page, which is super handy.\n\n332\n00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.110\nIf something catches my eye but\n\n333\n00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:28.610\nit's not a priority right now,\nI don't wanna get side tracked.\n\n334\n00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:30.250\nIt's very easy to get distracted.\n\n335\n00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:30.850\n>> Yes it is.\n\n336\n00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:35.470\n>> In fact the average user or\nperson nowadays has a less\n\n337\n00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:39.200\nof an attention span than a goldfish,\nand it's getting worse, not better.\n\n338\n00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.480\nSo, to save me from myself, I can just\nfavorite it, know that it will show up\n\n339\n00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.150\nhere in this section of my Delve,\nand then when I have time,\n\n340\n00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.280\nmaybe on the plane because you can't\nget away from the internet now,\n\n341\n00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.520\neven planes have internet-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n342\n00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.380\n>> There's nowhere to hide.\n\n343\n00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.180\n>> Nowhere.\n>> So maybe it's\n\n344\n00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.530\nan appropriate time to\ncatch up on those readings.\n\n345\n00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.750\nThere's a me section as well.\n\n346\n00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:01.180\nAnd I can do things that\nput my profile in there.\n\n347\n00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.490\nLook around, see what you'll find.\n\n348\n00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:06.100\nSo this is an introductory message,\nit will say got it.\n\n349\n00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.990\nRecent documents I've worked\non appear here, as well.\n\n350\n00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:13.210\nIt doesn't supersede, it doesn't override\nany permissions on the document.\n\n351\n00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:18.540\nBut again, it's one place to go again,\nif you're raising multiple devices,\n\n352\n00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:23.190\nI don't want necessarily have to\nsomehow save or copy ten open tabs.\n\n353\n00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.470\nI mean, I know favorites tend to transfer\nwith OneDrive and all, but this way, no\n\n354\n00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:31.330\nmatter what device I'm using, I can in one\nplace access recent documents I worked on.\n\n355\n00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.990\nHere's a shortcut to my OneDrive.\n\n356\n00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:35.870\nSo I can get there,\nI can create a new blog post,\n\n357\n00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.680\nI can give feedback to Microsoft,\nwith a little smiley face here.\n\n358\n00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.190\nSo that's Delve.\n\n359\n00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.590\nAnd again, some of these technologies,\nyou're not gonna need,\n\n360\n00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.210\nor use, all at once.\n\n361\n00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:47.180\nBut it's good to know they exist.\n\n362\n00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.580\nSome of them may request\nsome functionality.\n\n363\n00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.410\nSay wait a minute, that sounds\nlike we could use Delve for that.\n\n364\n00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:59.280\nSo let's go into Sway, and if you're\nlike me someone that's not necessarily\n\n365\n00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.536\ncreative when it comes to visual design,\nthis can make you look like a genius.\n\n366\n00:19:03.536 --> 00:19:07.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So there's tutorials which are useful.\n\n367\n00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.900\nSo I can create a multimedia presentation.\n\n368\n00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.810\nIt goes right to YouTube.\n\n369\n00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:11.850\nInteresting.\n\n370\n00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:12.655\nOkay, we'll can that.\n\n371\n00:19:12.655 --> 00:19:14.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n372\n00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.470\nit's nice to know there's tutorial videos.\n\n373\n00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.700\nI can import a variety\nof document formats.\n\n374\n00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.440\nAnd there's some examples here, so,\nclimbing Mt Rainier, how cool is that?\n\n375\n00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.800\nLet's examine one of these.\n\n376\n00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.180\nHopefully there's no audio content.\n\n377\n00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.120\nWell, I guess, I guess it couldn't hurt.\n\n378\n00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.880\nWe've got the overhead mic.\n\n379\n00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.520\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n380\n00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.530\n>> Actually this mic too.\n\n381\n00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:34.990\n>> Your lapel will pick it up, yes.\n\n382\n00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.710\n>> That's true.\n\n383\n00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:36.650\nOkay.\nSo here's an example.\n\n384\n00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:40.830\nSomeone made this and\nyou can see here on the left hand side,\n\n385\n00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:45.370\nwe can include things like texts,\npictures, videos, tweets, charts.\n\n386\n00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:50.350\nThere's all kinds of ways to\nadd content very quickly.\n\n387\n00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:55.540\nI can preview my work and remember this is\nan example that was already on the site\n\n388\n00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.765\nI've driven by Mt Rainier.\n\n389\n00:19:56.765 --> 00:19:59.010\n[LAUGH] And\n\n390\n00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:03.650\nthen you can see how animations light up\nby clicking on the Play button there.\n\n391\n00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:09.250\nSo an easy way to create\ncompelling content that's\n\n392\n00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.590\nviewable in any form factor.\n\n393\n00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.560\nKinda cool.\n\n394\n00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.060\n>> Absolutely.\n\n395\n00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.974\n>> Let's go back in where it was.\n\n396\n00:20:19.517 --> 00:20:23.933\nSway, and there's apps as well for\nvarious devices,\n\n397\n00:20:23.933 --> 00:20:27.590\nyour iPhone or Windows phone, android etc.\n\n398\n00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.095\nSo let's what happens when\nI click on create new.\n\n399\n00:20:34.123 --> 00:20:36.470\nSo we're all about different\nways of sharing things.\n\n400\n00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:41.890\nWhether it's in SharePoint proper,\nOneDrive, swear, Sway rather, don't swear.\n\n401\n00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.150\nThere might be swearing at Sway [LAUGH].\n\n402\n00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:49.760\nSo there's various formats there just like\nyou were creating a PowerPoint deck and\n\n403\n00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.160\nI could make a card format.\n\n404\n00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.120\nA little card there like a story line.\n\n405\n00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:58.290\nNavigate different ways.\n\n406\n00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:00.070\nLittle re-mix.\n\n407\n00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:04.220\nSo Microsoft comes up with different\nassortments of the elements\n\n408\n00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.860\nyou've selected.\n\n409\n00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.600\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n410\n00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:12.320\nSo that's kind of thing you definitely\nwant to just experiment with hands on.\n\n411\n00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.140\nLet's see,\nI don't think I showed the store before.\n\n412\n00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.880\nLet's just go into the store, since we're\ntalking about associated technologies,\n\n413\n00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.160\nthe store is definitely related.\n\n414\n00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:25.120\nWait for it to load up here.\n\n415\n00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.360\nOkay, so here is the office store.\n\n416\n00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.500\nAgain, you, I guess, we did look at this.\n\n417\n00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.910\nBut the point is you might want to\nrestrict the apps that users are allowed\n\n418\n00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:38.098\nto download and install to a preapproved\nlist that you've already selected.\n\n419\n00:21:38.098 --> 00:21:40.600\nOtherwise it could be quite traumatic for\n\n420\n00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:45.090\nyou, troubleshooting interactions\nthat maybe go wrong for some reason.\n\n421\n00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.520\nBecause you're unaware that\nthe application even existed\n\n422\n00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.420\nin your environment.\n\n423\n00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.657\nLet's close out of there.\n\n424\n00:21:54.919 --> 00:21:59.830\nAnd let's go to people.\n\n425\n00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:04.655\nPeople who need people.\n\n426\n00:22:04.655 --> 00:22:08.380\n[LAUGH]\nOkay that's going to kick off Outlook.\n\n427\n00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.239\nAlmost there it says.\n\n428\n00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:17.746\n>> They are so\nfriendly with their messages.\n\n429\n00:22:17.746 --> 00:22:22.850\n>> Yes, I know they hired\nsomeone from somewhere [LAUGH].\n\n430\n00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:27.716\nOkay this opens up an Outlook type\ninterface where I can find contacts and\n\n431\n00:22:27.716 --> 00:22:32.686\nI got the wow it should be an unhappy\nface we didn't find anything to show.\n\n432\n00:22:32.686 --> 00:22:35.340\nAre they glad I have no contacts?\n\n433\n00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:35.890\nThat's mean.\n\n434\n00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.890\n>> All right Mark, well I'll tell you\nwhat, this is a great look at a lot of\n\n435\n00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:46.700\nthe different technologies that we can\nincorporate into our SharePoint online.\n\n436\n00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:51.200\nJust to, again, to really to further\nincrease the productivity and\n\n437\n00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.630\nthe gathering of information and\nyou've said several times\n\n438\n00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:59.750\nbeing able to handle this flood of\ninformation that were given everyday.\n\n439\n00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:03.380\nFinding what's relevant to us or\nto whatever we're working on or\n\n440\n00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.050\nwhat our team is working on.\n\n441\n00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.070\nLot's of really cool things\nthat we can do to help.\n\n442\n00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:10.410\nMake sure users get what they need\nwithout flooding them with everything and\n\n443\n00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.220\nall the stuff they don't need.\n\n444\n00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.000\nSo thank you for that, appreciate to\nlook at all of those technologies.\n\n445\n00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.180\nHope everybody ou there enjoyed watching.\n\n446\n00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.680\nSigning off for ITPro TV,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n447\n00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.240\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n448\n00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.576\n>> And, we'll see you next time.\n\n449\n00:23:23.576 --> 00:23:29.500\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n",
