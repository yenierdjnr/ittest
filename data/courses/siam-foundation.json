everyone, and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.450\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison and\nwe got a treat in store for\n\n8\n00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.820\nyou, SIAM Foundations.\n\n9\n00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.640\nAnd here to help us along with\nthat very endeavor is Ms.\n\n10\n00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.310\nJo Peacock, how are you doing today, Jo?\n\n11\n00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.860\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Justin.\n\n12\n00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.720\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.200\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n14\n00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:34.200\nAbbreviations, there's some things there,\n\n15\n00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.700\nwhat do we actually need to\nknow to get started here?\n\n16\n00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.368\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthe first thing that I'm gonna do is,\n\n17\n00:00:40.368 --> 00:00:43.945\nI'm actually gonna correct your English.\n\n18\n00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:44.912\nCuz you know [CROSSTALK] so\n\n19\n00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:48.560\nit's SIAM's foundation-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is no S there.\n\n20\n00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we had our foundation level and\nwe are gonna go one foundation level.\n\n21\n00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.804\nBut SIAM stands for,\nSystems Integration and Management, and\n\n22\n00:00:57.804 --> 00:01:04.172\nSIAM is actually a management methodology\nfor the management of our IT Services.\n\n23\n00:01:04.172 --> 00:01:05.142\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n24\n00:01:05.142 --> 00:01:07.476\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n[CROSSTALK] look at that.\n\n25\n00:01:07.476 --> 00:01:09.067\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Will get you every time.\n\n26\n00:01:09.067 --> 00:01:13.431\n&gt;&gt; And you know what I really like about\nthis is that clearly we are starting from\n\n27\n00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:14.575\nthe foundation.\n\n28\n00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:16.772\nAs you can see [LAUGH] So\n\n29\n00:01:16.772 --> 00:01:19.672\nwhat we're gonna be doing is we're gonna\nbe looking at the SIAM methodology, and\n\n30\n00:01:19.672 --> 00:01:25.342\nhow it applies to IT, where it fits in,\nand well, exactly what it means.\n\n31\n00:01:25.342 --> 00:01:28.182\nAnd in this introduction episode\nwe're just gonna be starting off\n\n32\n00:01:28.182 --> 00:01:30.392\nwith exactly what SIAM is.\n\n33\n00:01:30.392 --> 00:01:35.042\nBut before we do that, I wanna talk\nabout our evolution through IT.\n\n34\n00:01:35.042 --> 00:01:39.567\nAnd our evolution through IT in terms\nof the types of IT that we have,\n\n35\n00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:44.000\n38 years ago when IT first started off,\n\n36\n00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.220\nor maybe 40 years ago,\nI'm not sure my age now Justin.\n\n37\n00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.780\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n38\n00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.298\nI wasn't alive then, so who knows?\n\n39\n00:01:50.298 --> 00:01:53.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That stung.\n\n40\n00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.280\n&gt;&gt; I can give it, and I can take it.\n\n41\n00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.512\nWhat can I say?\n\n42\n00:01:56.512 --> 00:02:00.446\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, all that time\nago way back in the dark ages,\n\n43\n00:02:00.446 --> 00:02:05.750\nwhen we started off with, we were into\nmainframes at that point in time.\n\n44\n00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.080\nYou probably don't remember what\none of those is, but anyway.\n\n45\n00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.920\nYeah, so IT was very much in house, it was\ninternal to the business organization.\n\n46\n00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.550\nAnd IT was supplied by external suppliers\nor vendors, however you wanna call them.\n\n47\n00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.610\nAnd it was supplied to the internal\norganization, and it was kept in house.\n\n48\n00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.130\nAnd we use to have these huge big data\ncenters, absolutely massive, thousands,\n\n49\n00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.510\nand thousands of square feet or meters\ndepending on how you want to go with that.\n\n50\n00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.800\nAnd then,\nthat's where we kept our processing power.\n\n51\n00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.920\nAnd the processing power was actually less\nthan we have in our mobile phone nowadays.\n\n52\n00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.105\nBut then, we moved through the evolution\nto local area networks and\n\n53\n00:02:51.105 --> 00:02:53.330\nmid-range systems.\n\n54\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.430\nAnd now what we have become is, we have\nbecome an environment within IT where\n\n55\n00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.880\nwe almost go back to main frame, only we\nallow somebody else to manage that for us.\n\n56\n00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.350\nSo we have things like Cloud technology,\nfor instance, where we'll allow our\n\n57\n00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.950\nexternal vendors to manage our IT,\nto manage our data sources, to manage\n\n58\n00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.490\nthe actual data storage itself, to manage\nbackups, to manage restores for us.\n\n59\n00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.340\nAnd in fact, we have something that\nwe call software as a service.\n\n60\n00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.680\nNow Justin, I know you that you know\nsomething about software as a service.\n\n61\n00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.280\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n62\n00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.346\nIt's just a little bit though.\n\n63\n00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:30.700\nIt's just a little bit.\n\n64\n00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.720\nAnd Jo I will say,\nI'm going to go with you.\n\n65\n00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.830\nI'm okay with meters.\n\n66\n00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.350\nJust based on my background meters\nare actually better for me, as well.\n\n67\n00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.530\nAnd I've been in environments where\nit's not necessarily a mainframe, but\n\n68\n00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.610\nwe've kept in-house computing\npower where people manage it\n\n69\n00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.350\nby computational clusters or\nsomething for engineering or physicists.\n\n70\n00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.570\nI'm thinking like giant craze ] that\nare in data centers and things like that.\n\n71\n00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.690\nNational laboratories, so\nthat still has an old school feel,\n\n72\n00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.850\nbut even that's starting to migrate to\nsome of these cloud services, just because\n\n73\n00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.480\nyou're not having to pay people to manage,\nand you get constant updates, right?\n\n74\n00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.580\n&gt;&gt; Right, well,\nmainframe still has a place.\n\n75\n00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.220\nAnd what we don't realize is,\ncuz we've got some really GUIs nowadays,\n\n76\n00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.020\nespecially with our mainframes, that\nthings like our financial institutions,\n\n77\n00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.110\nour banks are still using mainframes.\n\n78\n00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:22.070\nIf we look at, say, perhaps our hospitals,\ncertainly our retail services\n\n79\n00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.410\nwhen it comes to stock replenishments and\nstock ordering etc.\n\n80\n00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.510\nAnd even invoicing potentially\nit's managed by mainframe.\n\n81\n00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.230\nSo mainframe still has their place.\n\n82\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.450\nBut what we're looking\nat here in SIAM is we're\n\n83\n00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.156\nlooking at the management of all of those.\n\n84\n00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:43.796\nWe're talking about software as a service,\nwe're talking about cloud, and\n\n85\n00:04:43.796 --> 00:04:44.960\nwe're talking about mainframe.\n\n86\n00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.540\nWe're talking about local area networks\nand WANs, wide area networks, too.\n\n87\n00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.780\nAnd we're looking at the possibility,\n\n88\n00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.350\nbecause it's not really a possibility\nanymore, it's actually a likelihood,\n\n89\n00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.440\nthat every single organization has\ngot some element of all of those.\n\n90\n00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.380\nNow we've all heard of ITIL,\nyou've heard of ITIL.\n\n91\n00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.840\n&gt;&gt; I have heard that\npraise before [CROSSTALK]\n\n92\n00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.247\n&gt;&gt; Just saying.\n\n93\n00:05:10.247 --> 00:05:11.664\nWe've all heard of ITIL.\n\n94\n00:05:11.664 --> 00:05:15.610\nAn ITIL is a management methodology for\nmanaging IT services.\n\n95\n00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.510\nMost ITIL itself looks at\nthe management of either\n\n96\n00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.910\ninternal suppliers service providers,\nor external service providers.\n\n97\n00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.260\nThe fact to the matter is, that when we\ncome to dealing with external service\n\n98\n00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.790\nproviders, invariably we\nare not just dealing with one.\n\n99\n00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.560\nAnd while ITIL gives us a very, very good\nstructure for managing internal service\n\n100\n00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.979\nproviders, that's all of the operation\nside of things that happens in house.\n\n101\n00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.060\nWhat it doesn't give us is\na very comprehensive look\n\n102\n00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.730\nat how we manage the complex\nenvironment that\n\n103\n00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.450\ninvolves using multiple\noutsourced service providers.\n\n104\n00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.960\nSo I've prepared a little diagram for you.\n\n105\n00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.490\nSo as you can see then in step one is what\nwe call our traditional multisourcing\n\n106\n00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.060\napproach.\n\n107\n00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.350\nIt's not really step one.\n\n108\n00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.810\nIt's very traditional.\n\n109\n00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.630\nIt is how IT services are quite often\nenvisioned within an organization.\n\n110\n00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.440\nAnd you'll see that we've\nactually got an IT department.\n\n111\n00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.680\nBut that IT department consists of, and\nby the way, these are just examples.\n\n112\n00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.450\nThis is not how I expect your\nIT services to look, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.390\nBut you'll see that for\n\n114\n00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.470\nthis example, in step one there\nin the traditional environment.\n\n115\n00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.590\nYou've got network groups,\nNSG, Network Support Groups.\n\n116\n00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.220\nYou've got server teams,\nyou might have middleware teams.\n\n117\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.790\nYou've got application teams.\n\n118\n00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.010\nAnd you'll notice that they've got some\nelements of what we call in house support\n\n119\n00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.580\nand in house development but\nthen some elements are outsourced.\n\n120\n00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.260\nAnd that's traditionally\na word that we use.\n\n121\n00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.650\nWe use the word outsource.\n\n122\n00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.920\nSo, we might outsource support, or\nwe might outsource development, or\n\n123\n00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.370\nwe might outsource maybe\nthird level support.\n\n124\n00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.460\nSo, that's what we would consider\nto be a traditional structure.\n\n125\n00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.500\nIn our second structure, you'll see\nthat actually what we've got is that we\n\n126\n00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.490\nhave an IT department\nwith some retained stuff.\n\n127\n00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.210\nAnd then we've got one main vendor.\n\n128\n00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.610\nWhoever that vendor may be,\nthat one supplier.\n\n129\n00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.060\nAnd then what they have is underneath\nthem is lots of sub-vendors.\n\n130\n00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.800\nSo what you've got there is pretty\nmuch a predominantly outsourced IT\n\n131\n00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.700\nstructure, predominantly.\n\n132\n00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.530\nYou've still got some people\ninternally within our IT department, so\n\n133\n00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.180\ninternally within the organization.\n\n134\n00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.610\nAnd then step three,\nwe've got what we call multi-sourced\n\n135\n00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.550\nenvironment where we've got an internal\nIT structure, very minimal.\n\n136\n00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:54.513\nBut then what we have is a structure\nthere of multiple vendors.\n\n137\n00:07:54.513 --> 00:07:59.455\nSo maybe you'll have one supplier for,\nlet's say, office and another supplier for\n\n138\n00:07:59.455 --> 00:08:01.249\nmaybe your financial system.\n\n139\n00:08:01.249 --> 00:08:05.519\nAnd then another supplier for\nsomething else and another supplier for\n\n140\n00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:06.610\nsomething else.\n\n141\n00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.510\nI just wanna spend a little\nbit of time actually.\n\n142\n00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.507\nAnd now this is where I put Justin on the\nspot, because I wanna spend a bit of time\n\n143\n00:08:12.507 --> 00:08:16.640\njust discussing the advantages and\ndisadvantages of each of these structures.\n\n144\n00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.541\nAnd let's look at\nthe traditional structure.\n\n145\n00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:23.851\nNow by the way, I am not telling\nyou that any of these are right or\n\n146\n00:08:23.851 --> 00:08:25.490\nthat they are wrong.\n\n147\n00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.358\nThese are just the different types of\nstructures that we may have within\n\n148\n00:08:29.358 --> 00:08:30.138\nour IT teams.\n\n149\n00:08:30.138 --> 00:08:31.780\nSo let's take a look at the first one.\n\n150\n00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:38.539\nThe first one is our internal IT service\nprovider, as we might once call them.\n\n151\n00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:42.810\nSo we've got a lot of in-house\nwork that's going on there.\n\n152\n00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.623\nWhat do you reckon the advantages\nare Justin of that in house?\n\n153\n00:08:45.623 --> 00:08:49.779\n&gt;&gt; So I would think the advantages here\nis you kind of get to keep your eye,\n\n154\n00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.670\nyou finger on all peices of it.\n\n155\n00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:56.003\nAnd you have more control over\nwhat's actually happening with those\n\n156\n00:08:56.003 --> 00:08:59.297\nrespective subdivisions,\nthat would be my guess.\n\n157\n00:08:59.297 --> 00:08:59.955\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n158\n00:08:59.955 --> 00:09:01.166\n&gt;&gt; And you're looking at me-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n159\n00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:03.133\n&gt;&gt; Sideways, like I don't know.\n\n160\n00:09:03.133 --> 00:09:08.449\nAnd Just to clarify, we see that last\nrow there that we have outsourcing,\n\n161\n00:09:08.449 --> 00:09:10.620\nthat's just illustrative.\n\n162\n00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.890\nThere may be some of those subsections\nthat have no outsourcing, correct?\n\n163\n00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.811\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right,\nI mean sometimes in some organizations,\n\n164\n00:09:16.811 --> 00:09:18.389\ndevelopment is done internally.\n\n165\n00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:22.614\nSo when we say outsourcing, what we\nmay mean is actually to the internal,\n\n166\n00:09:22.614 --> 00:09:26.170\nsort of project teams, etc.,\nsoftware development team.\n\n167\n00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.390\nSo yes,\nit could be a mixture of all of them.\n\n168\n00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:34.128\nOne of the advantages of this is\nthat you've got a response to your\n\n169\n00:09:34.128 --> 00:09:35.886\nbusiness environment.\n\n170\n00:09:35.886 --> 00:09:39.667\nSo when the business environment changes,\nand let's face it, okay,\n\n171\n00:09:39.667 --> 00:09:43.764\nthere is absolutely no organization\nanywhere in the world that consults with\n\n172\n00:09:43.764 --> 00:09:46.410\nIT before it makes a business decision.\n\n173\n00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.106\nYeah, normally, if they're going to\nacquire a subsidiary or something\n\n174\n00:09:50.106 --> 00:09:54.175\nlike that, they'll go away and do that,\nand then they'll tell IT afterwards.\n\n175\n00:09:54.175 --> 00:09:57.090\nYeah, so this allows us to react to that.\n\n176\n00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.670\nIt allows us to be very reactive\nto the business organization.\n\n177\n00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:06.745\nIt also allows us to understand\nthe organization better as well.\n\n178\n00:10:06.745 --> 00:10:08.550\nBut then there are some disadvantages.\n\n179\n00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.842\nSo things like, in the same way that I\nsaid that the organization doesn't tell us\n\n180\n00:10:13.842 --> 00:10:16.707\nbefore they're going to make any\nbig decisions, well guess what?\n\n181\n00:10:16.707 --> 00:10:18.150\nNeither do our suppliers.\n\n182\n00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:23.832\nSo things like new, I mean even just\nsimple things like service packs for\n\n183\n00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:28.683\ninstance, when service packs are released,\nwhen updates are released.\n\n184\n00:10:28.683 --> 00:10:31.190\nWhen the manufacturer's\ndecided that they no\n\n185\n00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.320\nlonger want to make that\nparticular model of laptop.\n\n186\n00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.371\nThey've decided that they're\ngoing to upgrade it and\n\n187\n00:10:36.371 --> 00:10:38.120\nmake a completely\ndifferent model of laptop.\n\n188\n00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.081\nWhen you have just spent the last\nsix months perfecting a build for\n\n189\n00:10:42.081 --> 00:10:43.810\nthat particular model.\n\n190\n00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:48.910\nAnd now all of a sudden that\nmodel is no longer available.\n\n191\n00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.420\nWell there are many disadvantages there.\n\n192\n00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.170\nThe other disadvantage to this sort of\n\n193\n00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.289\nwhat we might term to be the traditional\napproach, the other disadvantage is cost.\n\n194\n00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.380\nIt's very costly and\nyou gotta think about you know,\n\n195\n00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:06.890\nwhat you might consider to be incidental\ncosts but they are cost never the less.\n\n196\n00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:11.842\nSo things like training for\ninstance when it comes to keeping\n\n197\n00:11:11.842 --> 00:11:16.405\nyour team updated with all of\nthe latest innovations and\n\n198\n00:11:16.405 --> 00:11:19.880\nall those, well just all of the updates.\n\n199\n00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.740\nUpdated with updates,\nis that right when you say that?\n\n200\n00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.798\nThat works.\n\n201\n00:11:22.798 --> 00:11:23.790\n&gt;&gt; They constantly-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n202\n00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.458\n&gt;&gt; Change things that we have to be\n\n203\n00:11:25.458 --> 00:11:26.040\naware of.\n\n204\n00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:32.120\nAnd correct me if I'm wrong, but there's\nalso ancillary kind of speaking of cost.\n\n205\n00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.370\nThere are corresponding changes to your\ncorporate structure that would have\n\n206\n00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.073\nto occur if you're managing\nan entire internal IT department.\n\n207\n00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:43.988\nLike associated human resources and\nnot only that but the space, right?\n\n208\n00:11:43.988 --> 00:11:46.458\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; So we're looking at the IT department\n\n209\n00:11:46.458 --> 00:11:51.790\nbut there's all this kind of creeping cost\nfactor for this traditional structure.\n\n210\n00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.500\n&gt;&gt; And it depends what\nthe organization itself is doing.\n\n211\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:59.100\nIf the organization is growing,\nthen you expect your IT teams to grow as\n\n212\n00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:04.002\nwell in relation in direct proportion\nto the actual organization.\n\n213\n00:12:04.002 --> 00:12:08.444\nOr if maybe for instance\nthe business might not do so well,\n\n214\n00:12:08.444 --> 00:12:11.355\npotentially for one financial year.\n\n215\n00:12:11.355 --> 00:12:13.743\nThen your IT team might have to shrink but\n\n216\n00:12:13.743 --> 00:12:17.145\nthen the following year they\nmay have to grow again.\n\n217\n00:12:17.145 --> 00:12:22.053\nThat's gonna be very difficult and that's\ngonna be very difficult to retain staff\n\n218\n00:12:22.053 --> 00:12:26.483\nin that particular model, if your\nbusiness is not a stable organization.\n\n219\n00:12:26.483 --> 00:12:30.775\nSo, whilst this model\nthe traditional model allows us\n\n220\n00:12:30.775 --> 00:12:35.110\nto be reactive to the needs\nof the organization.\n\n221\n00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.030\nUnfortunately, what it doesn't do,\n\n222\n00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:41.530\nis it doesn't allow us to be too flexible\nto the needs of the organization.\n\n223\n00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.846\nAnd it also doesn't allow us to be\nflexible when it comes to dealing with our\n\n224\n00:12:45.846 --> 00:12:46.813\nsuppliers too.\n\n225\n00:12:46.813 --> 00:12:49.938\nWe do get incredibly irritated,\nI mean we're in IT, and\n\n226\n00:12:49.938 --> 00:12:54.367\nwe do get incredibly irritated when\nmanufacturer or whatever that manufacturer\n\n227\n00:12:54.367 --> 00:12:58.840\nmaybe suddenly decides that they want\nto change the way they do something.\n\n228\n00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.654\nAnd their latest model of laptops might\nhave a different charging system, for\n\n229\n00:13:02.654 --> 00:13:03.240\ninstance.\n\n230\n00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.908\nWhich means that all of these chargers\nthat we've got lying around on\n\n231\n00:13:06.908 --> 00:13:11.018\neverybody's desks, so that you don't\nhave to bring your personal ones in,\n\n232\n00:13:11.018 --> 00:13:14.580\nnow we've gotta have two lying on\neverybody's desk just in case.\n\n233\n00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:19.500\nBecause we don't know what model of\nlaptop they have, just an example.\n\n234\n00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.718\nSo then we might move then\ntowards the single sourcing,\n\n235\n00:13:23.718 --> 00:13:26.330\nwhere we've got one main vendor.\n\n236\n00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.094\nThere's some advantages to that and\n\n237\n00:13:31.094 --> 00:13:36.973\none of the big advantages to that is\nthe ability to be kept up to date.\n\n238\n00:13:36.973 --> 00:13:40.400\nReally, it's basic risk management.\n\n239\n00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.717\nDo we want to assume the risk ourselves,\n\n240\n00:13:42.717 --> 00:13:45.998\nwhich is what we're doing\nwith that traditional model?\n\n241\n00:13:45.998 --> 00:13:50.550\nOr do we want to pass the risk of all of\nthose disadvantages onto somebody else?\n\n242\n00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.030\nAnd that's exactly what\nwe're doing in this.\n\n243\n00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:57.010\nBut what we're doing here with a main\nvendor is we are passing the risk on\n\n244\n00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.430\nto just one person.\n\n245\n00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.100\nI used to get told, when I was a kid,\nnot that we had a farm or anything,\n\n246\n00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.050\nnot to put all your eggs in one basket,\nright?\n\n247\n00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:09.680\n[INAUDIBLE] I don't know,\nI didn't even know where eggs came from.\n\n248\n00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.760\n&gt;&gt; I never really understood that,\nI was like,\n\n249\n00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.127\nwell do I keep multiple\nbaskets to carry them back?\n\n250\n00:14:14.127 --> 00:14:16.187\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n251\n00:14:16.187 --> 00:14:19.960\nultimately that means don't\nbet on any one thing, right?\n\n252\n00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.686\nDon't push all in on 36 red\nat the roulette table and go,\n\n253\n00:14:23.686 --> 00:14:25.065\nI hope I got it right.\n\n254\n00:14:25.065 --> 00:14:31.740\nBut for here, this main vendor, what kind\nof organization does that look like?\n\n255\n00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.427\nThis main vendor-\n&gt;&gt; I'm just still stuck\n\n256\n00:14:33.427 --> 00:14:37.260\non the vision of you running across\na field with lots of baskets of eggs.\n\n257\n00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.666\nI don't know, maybe I'm kind of\ntrying to make some sort of-\n\n258\n00:14:40.666 --> 00:14:42.591\n&gt;&gt; Well, you said run, and\n\n259\n00:14:42.591 --> 00:14:44.707\nthat's not gonna happen.\n\n260\n00:14:44.707 --> 00:14:45.349\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n261\n00:14:45.349 --> 00:14:47.788\n&gt;&gt; But I think that's where it comes from,\n\n262\n00:14:47.788 --> 00:14:48.300\nright?\n\n263\n00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.360\nDon't run cuz you'll smash them all?\n\n264\n00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.755\n&gt;&gt; Is that it?\n\n265\n00:14:51.755 --> 00:14:52.456\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n266\n00:14:52.456 --> 00:14:57.135\nI just think of it as like, I don't\nmake a bet on any one single thing.\n\n267\n00:14:57.135 --> 00:15:00.023\n&gt;&gt; See, now everybody else is envisioning\nyou running across the field,\n\n268\n00:15:00.023 --> 00:15:01.141\ncarrying lots of baskets.\n\n269\n00:15:01.141 --> 00:15:03.730\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI can not envision myself running.\n\n270\n00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:07.742\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So congratulations, that is fun times.\n\n271\n00:15:07.742 --> 00:15:10.100\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but\nnow he started talking about roulette.\n\n272\n00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.241\nAnd I haven't got a clue\nwhat he's about there.\n\n273\n00:15:12.241 --> 00:15:15.830\nSomething that spins, doesn't it, yeah?\n\n274\n00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:20.481\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the ball [NOISE] and\nthen wherever it lands and [INAUDIBLE]\n\n275\n00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:22.400\n&gt;&gt; That was a real sound effect there.\n\n276\n00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.068\nDid you notice that?\n\n277\n00:15:23.068 --> 00:15:23.950\n[NOISE]\n&gt;&gt; It was bad.\n\n278\n00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:25.510\n[NOISE]\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n279\n00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:27.581\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like he just got a bit of\n\n280\n00:15:27.581 --> 00:15:29.453\nan electric shock over there.\n\n281\n00:15:29.453 --> 00:15:32.679\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can't tell if it's a game or\nif it's how you keep mosquitoes away.\n\n282\n00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:34.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not entirely sure.\n\n283\n00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.832\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, you get the drift now, right?\n\n284\n00:15:37.832 --> 00:15:41.115\nOkay, we've used enough analogies,\nI should hope.\n\n285\n00:15:41.115 --> 00:15:44.416\nAnd I've got a little, but I'm gonna\ndo that now, for our next episode.\n\n286\n00:15:44.416 --> 00:15:49.173\nI'm gonna plant a little buzzer onto him\nthat's gonna give him a shock every now\n\n287\n00:15:49.173 --> 00:15:49.816\nand then.\n\n288\n00:15:49.816 --> 00:15:53.657\nYes, well moving on,\n[LAUGH] so let's say, no,\n\n289\n00:15:53.657 --> 00:15:58.367\nthat particular source in,\nit's got its disadvantages.\n\n290\n00:15:58.367 --> 00:16:03.336\nYou put in all your eggs in one basket as\nit were, but not running across the field.\n\n291\n00:16:03.336 --> 00:16:05.508\nYou're taking a risk with that one vendor.\n\n292\n00:16:05.508 --> 00:16:09.262\nBut you're taking no greater risk than you\nare with that traditional sourcing method.\n\n293\n00:16:09.262 --> 00:16:13.986\nBecause, again, you're putting all of your\nrisk with that traditional sourcing in\n\n294\n00:16:13.986 --> 00:16:15.955\nyour own internal IT department and\n\n295\n00:16:15.955 --> 00:16:20.110\nyou're assuming that they can keep up\nwith the needs of the organization.\n\n296\n00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.208\nHere, we're gonna have contracts in place,\nnot just to assume, but\n\n297\n00:16:24.208 --> 00:16:27.341\nto ensure that that vendor\ncan keep up with our needs.\n\n298\n00:16:27.341 --> 00:16:32.215\nBut what if they're let down by their\nsubvendors, their subsuppliers?\n\n299\n00:16:32.215 --> 00:16:35.900\nNow, you could argue that it\ndoesn't really matter because,\n\n300\n00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.236\ntechnically, our contract is\nwith the main vendor, and\n\n301\n00:16:39.236 --> 00:16:41.968\ntherefore what they do\nis entirely up to them.\n\n302\n00:16:41.968 --> 00:16:44.883\nOkay, well what about\nthose secure environments?\n\n303\n00:16:44.883 --> 00:16:48.403\nThose environments where things\nlike government installations,\n\n304\n00:16:48.403 --> 00:16:52.673\nfinancial institutions, for instance,\nwhere we have security requirements?\n\n305\n00:16:52.673 --> 00:16:56.095\nThose subvendors can't keep changing\nall of their methodologies.\n\n306\n00:16:56.095 --> 00:17:01.142\nThey can't keep changing all of their\nstaff just to bring in more staff to\n\n307\n00:17:01.142 --> 00:17:06.770\nhelp us with our training or to help us\nwith our requirements, because they might\n\n308\n00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:12.022\nneed security clearance, and they may\ntake six months for that to happen.\n\n309\n00:17:12.022 --> 00:17:15.279\nSo there is a risk with\nthat main vendor approach.\n\n310\n00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:20.270\nBut then, we have, well we call it Step 3,\nthe multi-sourcing approach.\n\n311\n00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.357\nAnd you could consider,\nfrom that perspective,\n\n312\n00:17:23.357 --> 00:17:26.663\nthe perspective that I've\njust been talking about,\n\n313\n00:17:26.663 --> 00:17:30.349\nyou could consider that to be\nthe riskiest, should we say.\n\n314\n00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:35.712\nBecause if you were in, say, a government\nenvironment, if you were in an environment\n\n315\n00:17:35.712 --> 00:17:40.634\nthat had a lot of security, then,\nif you're talking about multiple vendors,\n\n316\n00:17:40.634 --> 00:17:44.400\nthen that's a heck of a lot of\nmanagement that goes on there.\n\n317\n00:17:45.504 --> 00:17:46.705\nBut, you know what?\n\n318\n00:17:46.705 --> 00:17:50.274\nThat's where we actually find\nourselves a lot of the time now.\n\n319\n00:17:50.274 --> 00:17:54.350\nAnd most organizations find\nthemselves in an environment where\n\n320\n00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:57.379\nthey've got one supplier for, say, office.\n\n321\n00:17:57.379 --> 00:18:00.197\nAnd they've got one supplier for\ntheir financials.\n\n322\n00:18:00.197 --> 00:18:04.853\nThey've got one supplier for\nthe Internet, for instance.\n\n323\n00:18:04.853 --> 00:18:07.736\nAnd they've got many, many suppliers.\n\n324\n00:18:07.736 --> 00:18:11.887\nSo when we talk about the purpose of SIAM,\nwell,\n\n325\n00:18:11.887 --> 00:18:15.231\nthe purpose of systems integration and\n\n326\n00:18:15.231 --> 00:18:20.620\nmanagement is actually to help\nus deal with Step 2 and Step 3.\n\n327\n00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:25.160\nBut it's to help us deal with\nthat complexity that comes with\n\n328\n00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.888\nthat multi vendor approach,\ndealing with multiple vendors.\n\n329\n00:18:29.888 --> 00:18:35.182\nUltimately, you see,\nwhat we're interested in and we're in IT.\n\n330\n00:18:35.182 --> 00:18:39.210\nWe are interested in delivering\na service or services,\n\n331\n00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:44.437\na suite of services that are of value\nto our organization, that are gonna\n\n332\n00:18:44.437 --> 00:18:50.201\nhelp the organization achieve their\nvision and achieve their business goals.\n\n333\n00:18:50.201 --> 00:18:54.684\nSo what we've got to do, is to ensure\nthat everything that we provide,\n\n334\n00:18:54.684 --> 00:18:57.150\nall of the components of that service,\n\n335\n00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:01.505\nwe're going to work together to\ndeliver value to the organization.\n\n336\n00:19:01.505 --> 00:19:06.305\nAnd to align with their objectives\nto help them achieve their goals,\n\n337\n00:19:06.305 --> 00:19:10.607\nbearing in mind that some of\nthe components of that service may\n\n338\n00:19:10.607 --> 00:19:13.273\nbe sourced from different supplies.\n\n339\n00:19:13.273 --> 00:19:16.626\nSo we have to ensure that this\nconsistency in the contract,\n\n340\n00:19:16.626 --> 00:19:20.327\nwe have to ensure that we got\na service level agreements in place.\n\n341\n00:19:20.327 --> 00:19:23.414\nThat we understand what\nthe business needs, but\n\n342\n00:19:23.414 --> 00:19:27.421\nthen we also are able to manage\nthat multisource environment.\n\n343\n00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:29.777\nWe're able to manage multiple vendors,\n\n344\n00:19:29.777 --> 00:19:33.291\nmultiple suppliers that work\nin completely different ways.\n\n345\n00:19:33.291 --> 00:19:35.207\nAnd that's another challenge.\n\n346\n00:19:35.207 --> 00:19:38.752\nAnd you said they might work in\ncompletely different ways, but,\n\n347\n00:19:38.752 --> 00:19:43.402\nessentially, what they're doing is,\nspeaking completely different languages.\n\n348\n00:19:43.402 --> 00:19:47.528\nSo you might think, well, then,\nin this particular instance,\n\n349\n00:19:47.528 --> 00:19:51.205\nthe SIAM environment that IT\ndepartment manager, well,\n\n350\n00:19:51.205 --> 00:19:56.020\nwhat they're going to be doing, we're\ngoing to give them a name by the way.\n\n351\n00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:59.221\nWe're going to call them\na systems integrator.\n\n352\n00:19:59.221 --> 00:20:00.677\nThey act as a translator.\n\n353\n00:20:00.677 --> 00:20:02.703\nThey act as a coordinator.\n\n354\n00:20:02.703 --> 00:20:06.521\nAnd they are going to act as\nthe person that is actually going to\n\n355\n00:20:06.521 --> 00:20:07.997\ncoordinate all those.\n\n356\n00:20:07.997 --> 00:20:12.683\nAnd that's going to look at all of\nthe aspects of all of the services that\n\n357\n00:20:12.683 --> 00:20:16.509\nall of the vendors,\nall of the suppliers provide for us and\n\n358\n00:20:16.509 --> 00:20:20.965\nensure that they can then combine\nall of those components with those\n\n359\n00:20:20.965 --> 00:20:25.530\nservices into one service that we\ncan then deliver for the business.\n\n360\n00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.008\nSo the SIAM environment\nis similar to ITIL.\n\n361\n00:20:28.008 --> 00:20:33.082\nAnd I know that there are a lot of\npeople that will start to look at SIAM,\n\n362\n00:20:33.082 --> 00:20:35.836\nthat see this as an extension of ITIL.\n\n363\n00:20:35.836 --> 00:20:39.811\nAnd in our next episode,\nwe're going to cover the history of SIAM.\n\n364\n00:20:39.811 --> 00:20:44.554\nWe're going to take a look at where\nit comes from and why we, well,\n\n365\n00:20:44.554 --> 00:20:47.875\nyou've seen why we've had the need for\nSIAM.\n\n366\n00:20:47.875 --> 00:20:52.538\nBecause we are evolving into\nthe multi sourced environment, and\n\n367\n00:20:52.538 --> 00:20:55.353\nwe need something to help us with that.\n\n368\n00:20:55.353 --> 00:21:00.405\nWe need a methodology that's going to help\nus achieve successful management of that.\n\n369\n00:21:00.405 --> 00:21:04.857\nBecause, ultimately, what's really\nimportant, is that our organization,\n\n370\n00:21:04.857 --> 00:21:08.195\nwhether its public sector,\nwhether it's private sector,\n\n371\n00:21:08.195 --> 00:21:11.809\nthat it actually achieves its visions and\nit achieves its goals.\n\n372\n00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:14.722\nAnd IT, well, we're here to\ndeliver value to the business.\n\n373\n00:21:14.722 --> 00:21:19.030\nWe're not here to do what we want to do,\nalthough, quite frankly, I've been in IT\n\n374\n00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:23.217\nfor way too many years now and I know that\nthat's exactly what we like to do, but,\n\n375\n00:21:23.217 --> 00:21:25.644\nno, [LAUGH] that's not\nwhat we're here to do.\n\n376\n00:21:25.644 --> 00:21:28.984\nWe're here to deliver\nvalue to the organization.\n\n377\n00:21:28.984 --> 00:21:33.722\nAnd in a multi sourced environment, which\nis what most of us find ourselves in,\n\n378\n00:21:33.722 --> 00:21:37.683\nthen we're going to take ITIL and\nwe're going to expand on that and\n\n379\n00:21:37.683 --> 00:21:42.240\nwe're going to look at that from a multi\nsourced environment perspective.\n\n380\n00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.862\n&gt;&gt; Alright, well, Jo,\nyou kind of wetted my appetite.\n\n381\n00:21:44.862 --> 00:21:47.030\nI'm interested to see how this goes,\n\n382\n00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:51.729\nbecause this is not necessarily a whole\nlot of aspects that I've had to deal with.\n\n383\n00:21:51.729 --> 00:21:54.087\nI've always been in my little sliver,\nand, well,\n\n384\n00:21:54.087 --> 00:21:55.867\nhopefully you are interested as well.\n\n385\n00:21:55.867 --> 00:21:59.423\nSo well,\nyou should definitely join us on back.\n\n386\n00:21:59.423 --> 00:22:02.099\nBut, for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n387\n00:22:02.099 --> 00:22:04.197\nSo signing off for ITPROTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n388\n00:22:04.197 --> 00:22:06.367\nAnd I'm Jo Peacock\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n389\n00:22:06.367 --> 00:22:15.122\n[MUSIC]\n\n390\n00:22:15.122 --> 00:22:17.538\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.313\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.313 --> 00:00:13.180\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.853\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.853 --> 00:00:17.846\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and\n\n7\n00:00:17.846 --> 00:00:21.419\nwe're coming back at you with\na part two of introduction to SIAM.\n\n8\n00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.570\nAnd well, if you haven't seen the part\none, definitely go check that out.\n\n9\n00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.830\nWe kind of set the stage.\n\n10\n00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.190\nBut we have a little more information\nthat we needed to impart on you.\n\n11\n00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.230\nAnd here to place us impart that\nvery information is Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.580\nHow are you today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; I am fine I think.\n\n13\n00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.070\nThank you.\nJustin how are you?\n\n14\n00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.880\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n15\n00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.790\nSo we started out with a,\n\n16\n00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.680\nI guess I'm not doing fantastic-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.220\n&gt;&gt; We started out with what is SIAM?\n\n18\n00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.300\nWhat are considerations we're gonna make,\nright?\n\n19\n00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.440\nWhere are we going from here?\n\n20\n00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.260\nWhat else do we need to know before\nkind of moving on to more specifics?\n\n21\n00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.245\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so in our last episode, and\n\n22\n00:00:59.245 --> 00:01:03.772\nas Justin's already mentioned you know,\nplease feel free to catch part one.\n\n23\n00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:10.910\nPart one one really looked at why we would\nuse SIAM and when we would use SIAM.\n\n24\n00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.240\nHere we're gonna be delving into a little\nbit more about what SIAM really is,\n\n25\n00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.000\nthe history of SIAM, and again,\nnot so much when we would use it,\n\n26\n00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.680\ncuz we already looked at that in part one,\nbut certainly what SIAM is made up of.\n\n27\n00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.380\nIn other words, the components of\nSIAM as a management methodology.\n\n28\n00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.150\nAnd I wanna issue a little bit of\na warning as well at this point in time.\n\n29\n00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.251\nCuz, you know,\nI like to do that every now and then.\n\n30\n00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:39.852\nBut from now on, what we looked at in\nour last episode was very much just when\n\n31\n00:01:39.852 --> 00:01:43.230\nyou would use SIAM,\nwhat it would be appropriate for.\n\n32\n00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:50.611\nBut from now on, if you are studying for\nyour IT, what are we studying for here?\n\n33\n00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:52.950\nYeah, that's right, it's SIAM, yeah.\n\n34\n00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.039\nYou're studying for your foundation test,\nyour SIAM foundation through BCS or\n\n35\n00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.660\nXSIN, then from now onwards,\n\n36\n00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.870\nanything that we talk about\ncould be mentioned in your test.\n\n37\n00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.280\nSo this is when you've got\nto start paying attention.\n\n38\n00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.260\nAnd by the way, what Justin doesn't\nrealize is that by the end of this series,\n\n39\n00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.345\nI'm gonna be testing Justin.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n40\n00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:21.519\nI don't know whether to say I look forward\nto that, Jo or to be terrified, but\n\n41\n00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.015\nI have faith in you that you're gonna,\nwell you're gonna help us get through, and\n\n42\n00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:30.061\nit is prepared, well hopefully you,\nI don't know if she might leave me out\n\n43\n00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:34.291\nto hang to dry, I guess.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yeah he's got it, he's got it.\n\n44\n00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:38.400\n[LAUGH] So, what we're gonna look at in\nthe particular episode, is we're gonna\n\n45\n00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.500\nlook at, as we have already said We're\ngonna do our introduction to SIAM as in\n\n46\n00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.510\nwhat SIAM really is, what it consists of,\nthe components of the SIAM methodology.\n\n47\n00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.840\nSo a little bit of history about SIAM as\nwell, because actually for those of you\n\n48\n00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.740\nthat have any understanding of ITIL, then\nthe history of SIAM will surprise you.\n\n49\n00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.521\nSo SIAM is really, as we've already\ncovered in our last episode,\n\n50\n00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:12.159\na management methodology that allows us\nto manage a multi-sourced environment.\n\n51\n00:03:14.205 --> 00:03:16.080\nThat's common nowadays, right?\n\n52\n00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.120\nNot everybody has a large\norganization where we have a full\n\n53\n00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.170\nsuite of IT people and a full suite of\nIT people by that I mean the developers.\n\n54\n00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.770\nI mean the support people.\n\n55\n00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.870\nI mean the people that\ncan manage the teams.\n\n56\n00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.750\nI mean people that deal with the business\nin the business relationship management\n\n57\n00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.590\nperspective.\n\n58\n00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.540\nI mean strategy for IT for instance.\n\n59\n00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.830\nWe quite often,\nwe don't have the specialism in house.\n\n60\n00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.480\nEspecially if you're an organization\nthat say growing very, very rapidly.\n\n61\n00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.540\nThen you may be looking outside for\nmore of your specialist support, and for\n\n62\n00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.930\nmore of your specialist development work,\nwhich means that sometimes we're in\n\n63\n00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.470\nan environment where the business strategy\ncan conflict with the IT strategy.\n\n64\n00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.510\nAnd that's not deliberate But\nwe find it within rapidly growing\n\n65\n00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.620\norganizations that that\nquite often happens.\n\n66\n00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.150\nIn the organization wants to\ngo off in one direction but\n\n67\n00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.520\ntheir suppliers,\nwell they're holding them back almost.\n\n68\n00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.760\nAnd we've gone to suppliers to try and\nfacilitate our business goals, and\n\n69\n00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.960\nwe've gone to suppliers to try and\nhelp us achieve that vision.\n\n70\n00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.875\nBut unfortunately,\nthe supplies are now holding us back,\n\n71\n00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:36.493\nbecause they cannot give us the tools,\nthe equipment, or actually,\n\n72\n00:04:36.493 --> 00:04:40.269\nthe software that we need to\nbe able to achieve our goals.\n\n73\n00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:45.630\nSo SIAM itself looks at that\nparticular business model.\n\n74\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.086\nIt looks at the IT environment where\nIT is sourced by multiple vendors and\n\n75\n00:04:51.086 --> 00:04:57.618\nit provides that governance to management\nintegration and well, most importantly,\n\n76\n00:04:57.618 --> 00:05:03.443\nthe assurance that IT services are going\nto deliver what the business needs.\n\n77\n00:05:03.443 --> 00:05:07.278\nAnd I'm not just talking about today,\nbecause what the business needs today is\n\n78\n00:05:07.278 --> 00:05:10.610\ninvariably gonna be different to\nwhat the business needs tomorrow.\n\n79\n00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.560\nAnd in fact, Justin and\nI were talking in between episodes,\n\n80\n00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.110\nbecause we do, I don't know why\nyou might think that we do.\n\n81\n00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.827\nBut we do.\n[LAUGH] And\n\n82\n00:05:19.827 --> 00:05:23.390\nwe were just saying that\nin a lot of environments,\n\n83\n00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.490\nin certain environments we\ndon't think far enough ahead.\n\n84\n00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.490\nAnd then in other environments,\nwe think too far ahead.\n\n85\n00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.620\nAnd you can't plan too\nfar ahead now a days.\n\n86\n00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.090\nYou can't plan for\nwhat five years is going to look like.\n\n87\n00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.470\nBecause quite honestly we don't know\nwhat five years is going to look like.\n\n88\n00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.580\nWe never know even what our cell\nphone's going to look like next year.\n\n89\n00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.540\nSo SIAM allows us to utilize\n\n90\n00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.920\nsuppliers, utilizing suppliers\nin a way that we can be\n\n91\n00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.650\nflexible to meet the needs of the business\nbut without being too constrained.\n\n92\n00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.235\nAnd that's what SIAM allows us to do.\n\n93\n00:06:01.235 --> 00:06:05.322\nWe've got to get ultimately, we've got\nto get value for my service providers.\n\n94\n00:06:05.322 --> 00:06:07.030\nThat's what we've got\nto ensure that we do.\n\n95\n00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.840\nAnd I'm not just talking about value for\n\n96\n00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.770\nmoney because values not just\nabout a financial return.\n\n97\n00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.300\nValue is also about things like\nachievement of certain business goals,\n\n98\n00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.600\nbut also maybe getting to market quicker\nthan any of our competitors are or\n\n99\n00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.730\nmaybe adhering to regulations.\n\n100\n00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.140\nThese are all value returns that we\nwant our suppliers to facilitate for us.\n\n101\n00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.350\nSo, SIAM itself, then, as a management\nmethodology allows us to manage\n\n102\n00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.920\nour processes, and our functions,\nand those suppliers as well.\n\n103\n00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:48.150\nUltimately, we're gonna have\na wide ranging group of suppliers.\n\n104\n00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.980\nThey're gonna be diverse.\n\n105\n00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.840\nWhat they're actually going to supply for\n\n106\n00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.620\nus is going to be very\nspecialized in their arena.\n\n107\n00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.890\nBut yet we have got to have processes\nthat work for our customer.\n\n108\n00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.710\nLet's think about this logically.\n\n109\n00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:06.940\nHow would you feel, Justin?\n\n110\n00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.750\nAnd I like to ask him questions.\n\n111\n00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.700\nWe've got to put him on the spot.\n\n112\n00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.830\nHow would you feel if I gave you,\nlet's say, for instance,\n\n113\n00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.170\nyou've got a laptop, right?\n\n114\n00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.100\nBut things go wrong.\n\n115\n00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.310\nThey do.\n\n116\n00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:25.260\nSo if I gave you a huge list of\ndifferent telephone numbers to call\n\n117\n00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.580\nevery time you had a problem.\n\n118\n00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.870\nSo maybe you had one phone number to call\nif you had a problem with Outlook and\n\n119\n00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.840\nyou had another phone number to call if\nyou had a problem with, I don't know,\n\n120\n00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.580\nwhat other app you've got on there.\n\n121\n00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.110\nAnd another phone number to call\nif you had a problem with Excel.\n\n122\n00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:44.610\nAnd another problem to call if you had\nan issue with our messaging system,\n\n123\n00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.520\nfor instance.\n\n124\n00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.470\nHow would you feel if I gave you 20\ndifferent phone numbers to call?\n\n125\n00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.031\n&gt;&gt; For me, it's a little overwhelming.\n\n126\n00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:53.044\nWhen you give this kind of broad,\nnumber one,\n\n127\n00:07:53.044 --> 00:07:56.521\nI would be glad that I had\nsome kind of assistance, but\n\n128\n00:07:56.521 --> 00:08:01.410\nthere are times where I don't\nnecessarily know what's going on, right?\n\n129\n00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.618\nI'm like, it's Outlook,\nbut is it really Outlook?\n\n130\n00:08:03.618 --> 00:08:05.950\nAnd then I have to call one phone number.\n\n131\n00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.606\nAnd then like well actually that's\ncaused by a hardware issue,\n\n132\n00:08:08.606 --> 00:08:09.842\nyou need to call this number.\n\n133\n00:08:09.842 --> 00:08:14.483\nI don't like this weird telephone\nchain that I sometimes have to play.\n\n134\n00:08:14.483 --> 00:08:18.275\nThat's just me personally.\n&gt;&gt; Right, you don't like it, but\n\n135\n00:08:18.275 --> 00:08:21.704\njust think about what it does\nto your productivity and\n\n136\n00:08:21.704 --> 00:08:23.699\nwhat it does to your effiency.\n\n137\n00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:28.193\nAnd anybody that knows me and anybody\nthat's seen any of my other episodes\n\n138\n00:08:28.193 --> 00:08:31.816\nwill know that I spend a lot of\ntime focusing on efficiency,\n\n139\n00:08:31.816 --> 00:08:33.860\nand focusing on effectiveness.\n\n140\n00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.226\nAnd that's not particularly efficient,\nbut in organizations where we have that\n\n141\n00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:41.715\nmultivendor approach,\nthen that's quite often what happens.\n\n142\n00:08:41.715 --> 00:08:45.985\nYou get different phone numbers to call,\nand then what will happen is and\n\n143\n00:08:45.985 --> 00:08:50.115\nI don't know about you, but\nI'm in full agreement with Justin here.\n\n144\n00:08:50.115 --> 00:08:53.995\nBecause I can tell you now that I\nabsolutely hate it, when they turn around\n\n145\n00:08:53.995 --> 00:08:58.425\nand then they set all that's not\nmy problem that's their problem.\n\n146\n00:08:58.425 --> 00:09:06.184\nI used to have issues at one time a few\nyears ago now with my Internet at home.\n\n147\n00:09:06.184 --> 00:09:11.154\nAnd it was forever, you'd call them up and\nthey would say, it's the router, or\n\n148\n00:09:11.154 --> 00:09:12.480\nthe router.\n\n149\n00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.239\nNo, it's not, and that was because I\nbrought my own router because I wanted\n\n150\n00:09:16.239 --> 00:09:20.195\nsomething that was a little bit faster\nthan the stock one that they provided.\n\n151\n00:09:20.195 --> 00:09:22.320\nYes, and then it's the hardware.\n\n152\n00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.033\nAnd then you call up the hardware\nmanufacturer and it's no, it's not.\n\n153\n00:09:25.033 --> 00:09:27.048\nIt's definitely your connection,\n\n154\n00:09:27.048 --> 00:09:30.558\nand it turned out that it was\nsomething to do with my connection,\n\n155\n00:09:30.558 --> 00:09:34.980\nin that they had put a signal blocker on\nmy line that was installed in the house.\n\n156\n00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:39.500\nBecause we had a huge, big TV antenna\nsomewhere very close to the house.\n\n157\n00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.880\nAnd they put a signal blocker\non all of the lines and\n\n158\n00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.320\nthat was what was causing the problem.\n\n159\n00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.277\nAnd as it turned out,\nI ended up diagnosing that one myself and\n\n160\n00:09:48.277 --> 00:09:52.858\nremoving the thing myself because\nof exactly what you've described.\n\n161\n00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:56.355\nAnd it wasn't the fact that they didn't\nhave anybody that was technically\n\n162\n00:09:56.355 --> 00:09:59.300\ncomponent enough to diagnose,\nI'm assuming that they did.\n\n163\n00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.610\n[LAUGH] But it was simply the fact\nthat I couldn't get anywhere.\n\n164\n00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:09.990\nBecause of that we like to call that in\nthe UK, we'll sort of call that incident.\n\n165\n00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.640\nWhich is where everybody's just batting\nit around from one to the other.\n\n166\n00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.450\nBut ultimately the customer feels\nas though they get absolutely no\n\n167\n00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.360\nservice whatsoever.\n\n168\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.010\nIt's not only not efficient,\n\n169\n00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:26.040\nit's also incredibly demoralizing\nfrom a customer perspective.\n\n170\n00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.949\nBut they don't perceive\nthat they're getting value.\n\n171\n00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:31.210\nThey're services might work great\nwhen they actually get them.\n\n172\n00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.650\nBut if then when something goes wrong, or\n\n173\n00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.740\nwhen they want a new enhancement,\nthey've gotta phone 15 different people.\n\n174\n00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.837\nAnd they still haven't gotten to the\nbottom of it, then they're not too happy.\n\n175\n00:10:41.837 --> 00:10:44.390\nAnd this is where SIAM comes in.\n\n176\n00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:50.700\nAnd what SIAM will do, is it allows\nus to manage those multiple vendors.\n\n177\n00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:57.255\nSo it puts relationships in place between\nthose suppliers in-between those vendors.\n\n178\n00:10:57.255 --> 00:10:59.915\nWe call this the eco-system.\n\n179\n00:11:01.148 --> 00:11:04.838\nIt's an eco-system all in its own right,\nbecause it's not just one service\n\n180\n00:11:04.838 --> 00:11:07.923\nprovider, we're talking about\nmultiple service providers.\n\n181\n00:11:07.923 --> 00:11:12.876\nAnd in this SIAM ecosystem everyone\nneeds to know their own role and\n\n182\n00:11:12.876 --> 00:11:16.775\ntheir responsibilities\nwithin that eco-system.\n\n183\n00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.239\nThat prevents it, so that presents well.\n\n184\n00:11:20.239 --> 00:11:22.600\nThere is one challenges too.\n\n185\n00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.331\nBecause that means that we have got to be,\nquite frankly,\n\n186\n00:11:27.331 --> 00:11:31.968\nopen and honest with all of\nour suppliers about what other\n\n187\n00:11:31.968 --> 00:11:36.521\nsuppliers are doing for us,\nultimately as a customer.\n\n188\n00:11:36.521 --> 00:11:38.787\nAnd it doesn't matter whether\nyou're an external customer or\n\n189\n00:11:38.787 --> 00:11:40.330\nwhether you're an internal customer.\n\n190\n00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.732\nAs a customer what you wanna do, and\nI'm sure Justin will agree with me,\n\n191\n00:11:44.732 --> 00:11:46.905\nis you wanna call one phone number.\n\n192\n00:11:46.905 --> 00:11:51.370\nYou don't care what happens,\nyou just want it fixed, right?\n\n193\n00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:52.506\n&gt;&gt; I can vouch for that,\n\n194\n00:11:52.506 --> 00:11:56.549\nbecause really I kind of just feel like\nI'm in a circle of a bunch of people who\n\n195\n00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.769\nare pointing to the right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n196\n00:11:58.769 --> 00:12:00.801\n&gt;&gt; And you just kind of do this weird\n\n197\n00:12:00.801 --> 00:12:05.922\nturnaround twist, and if I had one phone\nnumber, that would help me alleviate,\n\n198\n00:12:05.922 --> 00:12:10.920\nbe more efficient, because we were\ntalking earlier about business value.\n\n199\n00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.326\nI think of business value, if you can\nkeep that employees empowered and\n\n200\n00:12:15.326 --> 00:12:19.220\nkeep morale up, then the rest of\nit kinda takes care of itself,\n\n201\n00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.115\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n202\n00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:23.015\nwe expect our services to\nbe fairly intuitive, right?\n\n203\n00:12:23.015 --> 00:12:25.351\nAnd so we expect services to work.\n\n204\n00:12:25.351 --> 00:12:27.707\nAnd one of my sayings,\n\n205\n00:12:27.707 --> 00:12:34.400\nI guess is that people only\nnotice IT when things go wrong.\n\n206\n00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.218\nYou never notice IT when\neverything is working fine.\n\n207\n00:12:37.218 --> 00:12:39.473\nI don't know whether\nyou've ever noticed it and\n\n208\n00:12:39.473 --> 00:12:41.453\nif you haven't then that proves my point.\n\n209\n00:12:41.453 --> 00:12:45.081\nYou don't notice it because you expect\nto raise the lid on that laptop and\n\n210\n00:12:45.081 --> 00:12:46.687\nyou expect it to be working, and\n\n211\n00:12:46.687 --> 00:12:50.190\nyou don't have ever notice it\nuntil something goes wrong.\n\n212\n00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:53.370\nSo when something goes wrong,\nyou expect it to be fixed.\n\n213\n00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:55.659\nNow let's think about this.\n\n214\n00:12:55.659 --> 00:12:59.630\nLet's think about having sort\nof 15 different suppliers.\n\n215\n00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.860\nJustin wants to call just one number.\n\n216\n00:13:03.979 --> 00:13:07.152\nAnd that one person,\nwhoever picks up the phone needs to be,\n\n217\n00:13:07.152 --> 00:13:12.320\nand we've used in that middle bullet\npoint, we've used that word, empowered.\n\n218\n00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:18.084\nBecause we need to have one process\nacross all of our suppliers.\n\n219\n00:13:18.084 --> 00:13:22.979\nBut that one person that picks up the\nphone needs to be empowered to be able to\n\n220\n00:13:22.979 --> 00:13:25.035\nspeak to that other supplier.\n\n221\n00:13:25.035 --> 00:13:29.968\nI'm going to pass that incident on,\nlet's say you can't get into emai, okay?\n\n222\n00:13:29.968 --> 00:13:34.530\nI'm gonna pass that incident\non then to Microsoft.\n\n223\n00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:38.464\nAnd Microsoft are gonna pick it up and\nare they're gonna say, well actually,\n\n224\n00:13:38.464 --> 00:13:41.505\nit's not our problem,\nit's a problem with the network, so\n\n225\n00:13:41.505 --> 00:13:43.370\nI'm gonna pass it on to say Comcast.\n\n226\n00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:50.205\nAnd Microsoft is going to\npass it on to Comcast.\n\n227\n00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:53.530\nNot you and not anybody else.\n\n228\n00:13:54.770 --> 00:14:00.687\nWe have one process for\ndealing that incident, just one.\n\n229\n00:14:00.687 --> 00:14:04.480\nAnd as far as Justin is concerned,\nhe's got one phone number to call.\n\n230\n00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.954\nAnd he's got one what we\ncall service level target.\n\n231\n00:14:06.954 --> 00:14:08.034\nIn other words,\n\n232\n00:14:08.034 --> 00:14:12.519\nhe knows that somebody is going to\ncome back to him within four hours.\n\n233\n00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.449\nAnd he doesn't need to know\nwhatever else is going on.\n\n234\n00:14:16.449 --> 00:14:19.716\nAnd so if there are a bunch of people\nall standing there with fingers pointing\n\n235\n00:14:19.716 --> 00:14:20.490\nto that, right?\n\n236\n00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:21.400\nYou don't need to know about that.\n\n237\n00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.191\nAll you need to know is that in less than\nfour hours, it's gonna work for you,\n\n238\n00:14:26.191 --> 00:14:26.726\nright?\n\n239\n00:14:26.726 --> 00:14:33.470\nSo SIAM allows us then to deal with what\nwe call this multi-sourced integration.\n\n240\n00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:37.898\nWe also call that MSI, as well, but\nyou know we like acronyms in IT,\n\n241\n00:14:37.898 --> 00:14:40.958\ndon't we?\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, without acronyms\n\n242\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.303\nwhat else do we have to do, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n243\n00:14:43.303 --> 00:14:44.783\n&gt;&gt; We have to come up with new acronyms\n\n244\n00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:47.850\nand it's not just IT,\nI think it's any technical trade.\n\n245\n00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:52.094\nThey're like, well you just got\nto remember ABCs, AFM, SCMT-\n\n246\n00:14:52.094 --> 00:14:52.872\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n247\n00:14:52.872 --> 00:14:54.496\n&gt;&gt; Who knows, and yes,\n\n248\n00:14:54.496 --> 00:14:58.475\nthose are all legitimate\nacronyms that I just said.\n\n249\n00:14:58.475 --> 00:15:01.980\nBut we do love them, and\nI think it allows us to feel important.\n\n250\n00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.256\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is that what it is?\n\n251\n00:15:03.256 --> 00:15:06.943\nI remember going on a course with\nIBM a good few years ago now.\n\n252\n00:15:06.943 --> 00:15:08.268\nIt was a UNIX course.\n\n253\n00:15:08.268 --> 00:15:11.429\nAnd one of the first things that\nthey said to us is, okay, so\n\n254\n00:15:11.429 --> 00:15:16.040\nin this course the most important acronym\nthat you're going to learn is TLA.\n\n255\n00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.778\nAnd then after that we're going to\nbe learning lots of other acronyms.\n\n256\n00:15:18.778 --> 00:15:24.773\nAnd do you know what TLA stood for?\n&gt;&gt; Lots of acronyms?\n\n257\n00:15:24.773 --> 00:15:28.030\nThere are a lot of acronyms?\n&gt;&gt; No, TLA stood for three letter acronym.\n\n258\n00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.337\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n259\n00:15:30.337 --> 00:15:31.213\n&gt;&gt; We do love them.\n\n260\n00:15:31.213 --> 00:15:32.940\nI'm not gonna lie.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, we do.\n\n261\n00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:37.116\nWe've got another TLA, or three letter\nacronym, and that's multi-source\n\n262\n00:15:37.116 --> 00:15:41.750\nintegration, and that's exactly what\nwe're doing in our SIAM eco-system, okay?\n\n263\n00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:47.973\nSo in that eco-system,\nwe have this multi-source integration.\n\n264\n00:15:47.973 --> 00:15:53.521\nAnd the bottom bullet point on this\nparticular slide talks about all parties,\n\n265\n00:15:53.521 --> 00:15:56.547\nall of our vendors\nare held accountable for\n\n266\n00:15:56.547 --> 00:16:00.009\nthe outcomes that they\nare required to deliver.\n\n267\n00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:05.532\nThat means that there has to\nbe some very firm Roles and\n\n268\n00:16:05.532 --> 00:16:11.400\nresponsibilities, and\nsome very firm boundaries.\n\n269\n00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:16.160\nAnd by firm, I mean that there\nhas to be no room for error,\n\n270\n00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.680\nthere has to be no room for ambiguity.\n\n271\n00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.860\nThese are not subjective,\nthey have to be objective,\n\n272\n00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.560\nbut yet\nthey still have to be flexible enough\n\n273\n00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.320\nto be able to deal with this situation\nthat's never cropped up before.\n\n274\n00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.512\nWe can hypothesize when it comes to\nwhat types of incident we may get, or\n\n275\n00:16:33.512 --> 00:16:35.864\nwhat types of development\nwork we may need.\n\n276\n00:16:35.864 --> 00:16:37.710\nAnd so we will do that a lot.\n\n277\n00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:42.880\nWe hypothesize and we say,\nthis is what could happen.\n\n278\n00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.050\nAnd so\nthese are where your boundaries are,\n\n279\n00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.940\nbetween all of your service providers,\nbetween your suppliers.\n\n280\n00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.100\nBut then something comes up that\nwe've never come across before.\n\n281\n00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.590\nAnd if you don't have the flexibility in\nyour contracts to be able to deal with\n\n282\n00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:59.580\nthat, then what happens?\n\n283\n00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.770\nIt disappears down a big black hole and\nit's never to be seen again.\n\n284\n00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.690\nSo our contracts have got to have\nthe relevant amount of flexibility.\n\n285\n00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:10.320\nAnd bearing in mind that we're\ntalking across platforms.\n\n286\n00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.769\nWe're talking not just multi-vendor, but\nwe're talking multi-platform as well, and\n\n287\n00:17:13.769 --> 00:17:15.216\nwe're talking multi-discipline.\n\n288\n00:17:15.216 --> 00:17:18.210\nAnd so that is a challenge.\n\n289\n00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.190\nIt is an incredible challenge.\n\n290\n00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:26.030\nSIAM can be applied to sorta\nmultiple organization types,\n\n291\n00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:30.270\nmultiple types, whether they're\nsmall individual organizations, or\n\n292\n00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:33.490\nlarge global organizations.\n\n293\n00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:37.970\nSIAM is gonna give you your best value\n\n294\n00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:42.500\nwhen we're dealing with organizations\nthat obviously using multiple vendors.\n\n295\n00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.810\nAnd organizations that are rapidly growing\nbecause organizations that are rapidly\n\n296\n00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:53.580\ngrowing tend to sort of gather new vendors\nand new suppliers like candies sometimes.\n\n297\n00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.340\nIt's just like going to the sweet store.\n\n298\n00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:59.430\nI'll have one of those and I'll have\none of those and have one of those.\n\n299\n00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:04.650\nIf you are in a single-sourced\nenvironment, if you're just using one\n\n300\n00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.980\nsupplier or\nyou have just internal IT support,\n\n301\n00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.510\nthen you're not going to get any advantage\nfrom using SIAM at all and in fact,\n\n302\n00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:17.110\nthe management methodology that I would\nrefer you to is the one that absolutely\n\n303\n00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.900\neverybody knows about and that is ITIL.\n\n304\n00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:26.438\nAnd ITIL will give you the best\nadvantage in a single-sourced\n\n305\n00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:31.340\nenvironment.\n&gt;&gt; So Jo, before you get too far along,\n\n306\n00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.900\nI just wanna make sure that I\nunderstand something correctly.\n\n307\n00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.000\nA little while ago,\n\n308\n00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.090\nwe were talking about the multiple\nnumbers versus the one number.\n\n309\n00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.210\nNow, when I call the single person,\nis that\n\n310\n00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.640\nsomeone that we employ that communicates\nbetween all of our vendors?\n\n311\n00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:52.200\nOr is it up to the vendors to communicate\nbetween themselves to deliver\n\n312\n00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:56.100\non their respective contracts?\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm gonna answer that question\n\n313\n00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.332\nwith, it depends.\n&gt;&gt; There you go, the nice, ambiguous,\n\n314\n00:18:59.332 --> 00:19:00.590\nsubjective answer.\n\n315\n00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:02.422\nNo, it's not subjective at all.\n\n316\n00:19:02.422 --> 00:19:05.957\nIt really depends on the type of contract\nthat we have and we're gonna talk\n\n317\n00:19:05.957 --> 00:19:09.550\nabout service integrators a little bit\nlater whether we have an internal or\n\n318\n00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.220\nan external service integrator.\n\n319\n00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.880\nBut ultimately to use a customer,\nthey should be seamless.\n\n320\n00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:20.280\nTo use the customer, you have one\nservice level agreement and that's it.\n\n321\n00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.430\nAnd that service level agreement\nis between you and let's save me.\n\n322\n00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:25.530\nYou call me and\n\n323\n00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.610\nthen I deal with everything that\nis happening behind the scenes.\n\n324\n00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:32.580\nAnd we have this agreement that says,\nmaybe, four hours.\n\n325\n00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.950\nAnd that's four hours between you and I.\n\n326\n00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.140\nWhat happens behind?\n\n327\n00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:42.740\nHowever many people that have got to be\ncalled and got to be involved in that,\n\n328\n00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.430\nthat's got nothing to do with you and\nthat's not me saying that's got nothing to\n\n329\n00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:50.110\ndo with you keep your nose out,\nthat's me saying you don't really want\n\n330\n00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:53.650\nto get involved in that and you don't\nneed to, it's not going to add value.\n\n331\n00:19:54.993 --> 00:19:59.342\nThat's what SIAM really is about and\nthe more vendors that we have,\n\n332\n00:19:59.342 --> 00:20:03.079\nthe more suppliers that we have,\nthen the more useful me as\n\n333\n00:20:03.079 --> 00:20:07.607\nthe service integrator is,\nbecause the less you need to be bothered.\n\n334\n00:20:07.607 --> 00:20:10.667\nBecause the one thing that you don't\nwant to do is as a customer, and\n\n335\n00:20:10.667 --> 00:20:13.461\nlet's pretend that you're\nfailing on technical customer,\n\n336\n00:20:13.461 --> 00:20:16.720\nyou don't necessarily know who\nit is that you've got to call.\n\n337\n00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.470\nYou just want to have one number.\n\n338\n00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:22.280\nBut because none of us are gonna\nbe talking to each other,\n\n339\n00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.000\na surprise they're gonna have\npotentially contracts with each other.\n\n340\n00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.270\nBut they're gonna be talking\nto each other definitely.\n\n341\n00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:31.350\nThen we have to have that\ntrust between those suppliers.\n\n342\n00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.000\nSo something that's mentioned on the test.\n\n343\n00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.670\nBut just to give you a little bit of\nbackground here where SIAM came from.\n\n344\n00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:43.696\nAnd I do quite often get asked\nabout the background to SIAM,\n\n345\n00:20:43.696 --> 00:20:46.443\nspecifically in relationship to ITIL.\n\n346\n00:20:46.443 --> 00:20:51.141\nAnd I've already mentioned that\nITIL is focused on value delivery,\n\n347\n00:20:51.141 --> 00:20:55.839\nit's focused on efficiency and\neffectiveness of our services, and\n\n348\n00:20:55.839 --> 00:21:00.280\nit works very,\nvery well in internal service providers.\n\n349\n00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.240\nITIL is, you probably know cuz you'll\nhave had some exposure to ITIL,\n\n350\n00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.570\ncame from the UK government.\n\n351\n00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:06.740\nWell, guess what?\n\n352\n00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:12.440\nSo did SIAM and so SIAM again has\na background in the UK government.\n\n353\n00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.980\nIt has a background in the Office\nof Government Commerce.\n\n354\n00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:22.330\nIn that department of the UK government\nthat looks after impartiality,\n\n355\n00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:26.960\nshould we say, that looks after how we\nmanage our services to be efficient and\n\n356\n00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:33.320\neffective to make best use of taxpayers'\nmoney, but in an impartial way.\n\n357\n00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:37.770\nAnd really, this is completely separate\nto ITIL, even though it's quite often\n\n358\n00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:44.310\nconfused with ITIL, because here we're\nspecifically managing multiple vendors.\n\n359\n00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:48.100\nWe're looking at\na multi-sourced environment.\n\n360\n00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.460\nAnd of course,\nthe use of SIAM has, well, I mean,\n\n361\n00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:55.110\nsince it was first conceptualized in 2010,\n\n362\n00:21:55.110 --> 00:22:00.640\nit's only been sorta about a years,\nand in that time it's expanded.\n\n363\n00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.910\nIt's over that time,\nit's evolved as we say.\n\n364\n00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:09.370\nBecause we have a less of\na reliance on single suppliers.\n\n365\n00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:11.610\nI mentioned in a previous episode and\n\n366\n00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:15.560\nyou've gotta watch this previous episode\nto really appreciate this cuz I mentioned\n\n367\n00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:20.985\nJustin running through fields with baskets\nof eggs and you have to be there, right?\n\n368\n00:22:20.985 --> 00:22:26.130\n[LAUGH] So we wanna remove that,\nI definitely wanna remove that,\n\n369\n00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.530\nI don't think I'm ever gonna\nremove that from up there.\n\n370\n00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:34.430\nBut we want to be able to use the multiple\nsuppliers to get the best use out of them\n\n371\n00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:40.090\nbecause that's where our specialism\nlies within each supplier.\n\n372\n00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:44.900\nAnd by the way, I found out, by the way,\nJustin, that specialism is a British word.\n\n373\n00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.810\nBecause you refer to specialization\nas opposed to specialisms.\n\n374\n00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:50.410\nDid you know that?\n&gt;&gt; I did not know that.\n\n375\n00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:51.761\nThey both sound all right to me.\n\n376\n00:22:51.761 --> 00:22:53.011\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n377\n00:22:53.011 --> 00:22:54.054\n&gt;&gt; If you just said,\n\n378\n00:22:54.054 --> 00:22:56.770\nthis is the specialism here,\nI'd be like, okay.\n\n379\n00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.000\nBut now that you say it,\n\n380\n00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.810\ntypically I hear, right?\n&gt;&gt; Specializations.\n\n381\n00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:01.700\n&gt;&gt; Specializations.\n\n382\n00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we hear specialism.\n\n383\n00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.429\n&gt;&gt; So SIAM is really about offloading\n\n384\n00:23:06.429 --> 00:23:10.573\nthe acquisition, retention and\nspecialization for\n\n385\n00:23:10.573 --> 00:23:17.016\na respective piece to the vendor, and how\nto manage those vendors to get the largest\n\n386\n00:23:17.016 --> 00:23:21.747\nvalue out of that specialization, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't like the use of\n\n387\n00:23:21.747 --> 00:23:25.460\nword offloading, it [LAUGH] kinda sounds\nlike we're getting rid of something.\n\n388\n00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.220\nBut essentially that's what we're doing.\n\n389\n00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:32.590\nWe're acknowledging that internally\nwe may not have the best skills.\n\n390\n00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:35.920\nAnd it's gonna cost us a lot of\nmoney to retain those skills.\n\n391\n00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.220\nAnd I don't mean to retain the staff cuz\nwe've gotta keep paying them more, but\n\n392\n00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.050\nwe have to keep training them in order\nto keep their skills up to date.\n\n393\n00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:46.410\nAnd we have to keep bringing in new\nequipment, and new test environments and\n\n394\n00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:47.700\neverything that that entails.\n\n395\n00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:52.590\nThat's a lot of money and\nwe know now it's cheaper to, well,\n\n396\n00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:56.173\nuse multiple suppliers\nto help us with this.\n\n397\n00:23:56.173 --> 00:24:00.955\nAnd so, what most organizations now\nhave is a mixture of internal and\n\n398\n00:24:00.955 --> 00:24:05.572\nexternal However, our use of\nexternal providers is growing, and\n\n399\n00:24:05.572 --> 00:24:10.530\nit has done within our IT world, and\nI mean, let's think about cloud.\n\n400\n00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:15.030\nEven now, we don't store our\ndata anymore on our own servers.\n\n401\n00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.800\nWe trust somebody else us to do it.\n\n402\n00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.496\nThat's the big word, by the way,\nwith SIAM, is trust.\n\n403\n00:24:20.496 --> 00:24:23.304\nCuz if you're gonna leave\nyour data to somebody else,\n\n404\n00:24:23.304 --> 00:24:26.965\nthen you've gotta trust that not only\nare they gonna look after it, but\n\n405\n00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:31.480\nthat they're also going to look after\nthe integrity of that data as well.\n\n406\n00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:36.770\nI mean, we hear so much in the press about\ndata breaches and security breaches, etc,\n\n407\n00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:44.380\nand I mean, we do a whole raft of series\non cybersecurity and IT security.\n\n408\n00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.730\nAnd that's something that we've\ngot to be aware of nowadays.\n\n409\n00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.820\nAnd certainly, when we're moving\ninto that multi-vendor approach,\n\n410\n00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.070\nthen yeah,\nit's something we've gotta be aware of.\n\n411\n00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:58.780\nAnd in this next slide, I mean,\nthat slide that I'm gonna show you here,\n\n412\n00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.530\nyou've seen this,\nwe've seen this in episode one.\n\n413\n00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.520\nAnd traditionally,\nin what we call that step1 there,\n\n414\n00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.370\nwhich is the traditional multi-sourced,\n\n415\n00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:14.535\nthen that would be perfect for\nan ITIL management methodology framework.\n\n416\n00:25:14.535 --> 00:25:19.493\nWhereas in step2 or in step3, or\nthe outsourced, the single source or\n\n417\n00:25:19.493 --> 00:25:21.038\nthe multiple source,\n\n418\n00:25:21.038 --> 00:25:26.760\nthen that's when we're moving into\nwhat we call the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n419\n00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:32.500\nSo in SIAM, then we have something\nthat we call a service integrator,\n\n420\n00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.390\nand the service integrator,\nwe've already mentioned it.\n\n421\n00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:41.740\nIt's that translation role between\nthe service provider, well,\n\n422\n00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:46.590\nno, it is the service providers,\nshould we say, and the the customer.\n\n423\n00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:51.550\nAnd so that integration role, we give it\na title, it's called a service integrator,\n\n424\n00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:56.290\nand as I've already said, it could\nbe internal or it could be external.\n\n425\n00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.960\nBut in that example that we talked about,\n\n426\n00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.100\nthe service integrator is\nthe person that you call.\n\n427\n00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.750\nYou'll call the service integrator,\nand the service integrator takes that\n\n428\n00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:09.370\nresponsibility for managing everything\nelse that's going on behind, and\n\n429\n00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:15.080\nall you see is that,\njust that one interaction.\n\n430\n00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.430\nAnd it's the service integrator's role\nthen to drive what we say collaboration\n\n431\n00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.820\nacross all of our vendors.\n\n432\n00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:27.480\nAnd so the service integrator\nmanages all of that complexity,\n\n433\n00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:32.360\nall of the complexity that's involved\nin step3, the multi-sourcing.\n\n434\n00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:39.910\nSo I am actually going to show you now,\non this particular slide, the scope,\n\n435\n00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:44.880\nand in this particular scope, what we'll\nsee here is, and I just like colors.\n\n436\n00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.660\nThat's what it is, yeah,\nI like to have pretty diagrams and\n\n437\n00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:51.436\ncolors.\n&gt;&gt; I like dull and drab, myself,\n\n438\n00:26:51.436 --> 00:26:55.990\nas much as possible, right,\nit is single-pen drawings.\n\n439\n00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:58.770\nThat's all I work with.\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, sorry,\n\n440\n00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.840\nthis is as good as-\n&gt;&gt; It is a nice color palette.\n\n441\n00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.945\n&gt;&gt; So you like the colors, yeah.\n\n442\n00:27:02.945 --> 00:27:08.710\n[LAUGH] So what we've got there is our\ncustomer organization are using specific\n\n443\n00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:14.030\nservices, and what we have underneath\nis that service integration layer.\n\n444\n00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.748\nThis is your translator, but\n\n445\n00:27:15.748 --> 00:27:20.560\nwhat you'll notice is that we've got\nfour different service providers.\n\n446\n00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:25.925\nAnd what you'll see is service E,\nthat's something that they provide, and\n\n447\n00:27:25.925 --> 00:27:30.980\nthen service provider\nB provides service F,\n\n448\n00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.490\nbut it consists of one and two components.\n\n449\n00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:40.080\nWhat this is trying to show you is that\nour services are made up of multiple\n\n450\n00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:40.860\ncomponents, and\n\n451\n00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:47.570\nmultiple components that are provided\nby varying different service providers.\n\n452\n00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.280\nIt's that integrator\nlayer that acts as that,\n\n453\n00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.610\nas we say, translation between the two.\n\n454\n00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:59.720\nI do not expect our customers\nto see anything in the orange.\n\n455\n00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:05.440\nI don't expect them to see anything in\nthat bottom layer, and they don't need to.\n\n456\n00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:10.920\nIf I am the service integrator,\nthen I am the person that\n\n457\n00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:16.900\nunderstands who supports what service and\nwho delivers what service.\n\n458\n00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.640\nIt's me, I am the person that knows that,\nnot anybody else.\n\n459\n00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:29.230\nSo in terms of the SIAM environment,\nthis is what we need to define.\n\n460\n00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:33.700\nWe need to understand what the service\noutcomes are that you, as a customer,\n\n461\n00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:39.760\nwant to achieve, and then I need to\nunderstand who my service providers are.\n\n462\n00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.330\nAs the service integrator,\nI need to understand who my providers are,\n\n463\n00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:48.740\nwho my vendors are,\nwho my consumers are, what the service\n\n464\n00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:52.990\nlevel agreements are going to be, in other\nwords, what you require from that service.\n\n465\n00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:56.610\nI need to understand what you value and\nhow you work, but\n\n466\n00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:59.550\nI also need to understand what you need.\n\n467\n00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:02.100\nAnd then I've already mentioned\nthe boundaries, very,\n\n468\n00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.950\nvery clear precise boundaries,\nand I need to understand.\n\n469\n00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:08.550\nI need to have that technical\nhat on cuz I need to understand\n\n470\n00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.530\nthe dependencies as well.\n\n471\n00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:14.783\nIf we've got one provider that's providing\nus with, I don't know, let's say SAP,\n\n472\n00:29:14.783 --> 00:29:17.171\nthen they might have\na dependency on Microsoft,\n\n473\n00:29:17.171 --> 00:29:20.160\nwho is supplying us with\nthe Windows environment.\n\n474\n00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.210\nBecause SAP may turn around and say,\nwell, you can't have this latest\n\n475\n00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:26.860\nversion until we've got Windows\n10 installed on all desktops.\n\n476\n00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:33.280\nSo all of the items that are in bullet\npoints there, these are all items\n\n477\n00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.900\nthat the service integrator\nhas to ensure exists.\n\n478\n00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:43.440\nAnd that's across all of these services,\nincluding corporate services,\n\n479\n00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:48.250\nIT services, cloud services, as we've\nalready talked about, and hosting,\n\n480\n00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:50.760\nand general user services as well.\n\n481\n00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:55.530\nAnd so really,\nwhat we've done in this particular\n\n482\n00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.620\nepisode is we've kinda wrapped\nup that introduction to SIAM.\n\n483\n00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:03.300\nWe've explained when it would\nbe useful to bring in SIAM.\n\n484\n00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:07.500\nAnd in our next episode, we're actually\ngoing to look at the ecosystem itself and\n\n485\n00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.340\nwhat that ecosystem consists of.\n\n486\n00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.550\nSo I hope to see you in our next episode.\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you so much, Jo.\n\n487\n00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:17.260\nI can definitely see how the service\nintegrators provide kind of\n\n488\n00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:23.250\na forward-facing interface that just\nkind of takes away all the cares.\n\n489\n00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:24.470\nI'm overgeneralizing there, Jo.\n\n490\n00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.820\nShe's giving me the sideways glance.\n\n491\n00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.671\nBut effectively, it's to reduce\nthe barriers to actually getting\n\n492\n00:30:29.671 --> 00:30:32.752\nthings done, right?\n&gt;&gt; The sideways glance was really because\n\n493\n00:30:32.752 --> 00:30:35.646\nof the fact that you\nmentioned forward-facing, but\n\n494\n00:30:35.646 --> 00:30:37.520\nI also need to look behind as well.\n\n495\n00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.250\nAs a service integrator,\nI need to look at you.\n\n496\n00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:45.600\nYou are my customer, and\nI need to respect you, but I also need to\n\n497\n00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.945\nmanage these guys behind me, and sometimes\nthat can be sorta quite chaotic, too.\n\n498\n00:30:49.945 --> 00:30:51.900\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n499\n00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:56.240\nI'm kind of interested to see how this all\ncomes together with herding cats, right?\n\n500\n00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.030\nThose things can get\nall kinds of sideways.\n\n501\n00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:01.030\nSo definitely stay tuned, we got more\ncoming at you, but for this episode,\n\n502\n00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.610\nwe're gonna go ahead and wrap it up.\n\n503\n00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:04.860\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host,\n\n504\n00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.720\nJustin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n505\n00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.567\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n506\n00:31:08.567 --> 00:31:14.244\n[MUSIC]\n\n507\n00:31:14.244 --> 00:31:17.052\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.963\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.963 --> 00:00:15.570\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone, and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.540\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and\n\n6\n00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.770\nwe're coming back at you with more\nabout SIAM, and, in particular,\n\n7\n00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.620\nwe're gonna be talking a little bit\nabout the ecosystem and terminology.\n\n8\n00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.380\nAnd here to help us along in that\nvery endeavor, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.310\nHow are you doing, Jo?\n\n10\n00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.090\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great.\n\n11\n00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.720\nThank you, Justin.\n\n12\n00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.710\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.900\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n14\n00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.170\nAnd I do know that terminology and\n\n15\n00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.140\njargon can be a huge barrier to entry\nwhen we're learning something new.\n\n16\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.210\nSo I guess we're gonna have to talk\nabout that before we get too deep\n\n17\n00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.180\ninto the weeds, right?\n\n18\n00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.920\n&gt;&gt; You wanna talk about the English\nlanguage, is that what you're saying?\n\n19\n00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.470\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, I have no\nexpertise on the English language.\n\n20\n00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.787\nI make up words on a regular basis.\n\n21\n00:00:52.787 --> 00:00:55.679\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay then, and\nI only mentioned that because we just\n\n22\n00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.340\nhad a conversation about whether we\nshould say ecosystem or ecosystem and\n\n23\n00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.465\nwhether we should hyphenate it or\nwhether we shouldn't hyphenate it.\n\n24\n00:01:03.465 --> 00:01:04.742\nBut you know what?\n\n25\n00:01:04.742 --> 00:01:08.145\nI just wanna say that us English\nare a pretty flexible bunch.\n\n26\n00:01:08.145 --> 00:01:12.420\nWe understand that you guys spell\nthings slightly differently.\n\n27\n00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.905\nI won't say wrong,\nI'll just say differently.\n\n28\n00:01:14.905 --> 00:01:19.100\n[LAUGH] We also understand that\nsome things are different,\n\n29\n00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.950\nand we've come to a compromise.\n\n30\n00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.100\nAnd we've compromised that in English,\nit's ecosystem with a hyphen and\n\n31\n00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.060\nin America, and then it's,\nwell, I don't know.\n\n32\n00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.236\nI give up.\n\n33\n00:01:30.236 --> 00:01:31.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what you're here for, right?\n\n34\n00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.170\n&gt;&gt; Just remove the hyphen, I think.\n\n35\n00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.650\nBut I have heard people call it ecosystem,\nand I'm like, I don't know, when I think\n\n36\n00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.650\necho, it's like you're yelling at the\ncliff face and it's coming back at you.\n\n37\n00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.650\nThat has an H in it.\n\n38\n00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.965\n&gt;&gt; When I say ecosystem,\nit reminds me of submarines.\n\n39\n00:01:46.965 --> 00:01:50.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm thinking, but anyway.\n\n40\n00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.190\nNobody ever knows where my mind\nis from one day to the next, so\n\n41\n00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.520\nwe're all right [LAUGH].\n\n42\n00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.290\nBut yeah, we're gonna look at this\nSIAM ecosystem, as I would call it.\n\n43\n00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.480\nAnd an ecosystem is really,\nI like the word anyway.\n\n44\n00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.980\nI like the fact that what it\nactually does is it promotes\n\n45\n00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.050\nthe fact that we're not just talking\nabout one IT service provider.\n\n46\n00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.190\nThat we're not just talking about\none particular environment.\n\n47\n00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.890\nWe're talking about a whole sort of\nliving, breathing organism almost.\n\n48\n00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.060\nSomething that's going to help our\norganization achieve their goals and\n\n49\n00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.810\nachieve their visions.\n\n50\n00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.310\nAnd it's not just one service provider.\n\n51\n00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.520\nIt's multiple service providers.\n\n52\n00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.250\nSo I've got a little diagram.\n\n53\n00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.910\nI was gonna say a little picture but\na nice pretty diagram up there.\n\n54\n00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.280\nAnd what you'll see is that we have, I\nwant you to just take a look at the middle\n\n55\n00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.680\nfor the moment and we've got customer\norganization and the service integrated.\n\n56\n00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.890\nNow, if you have been watching our\nprevious episodes then you'll see that in\n\n57\n00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.540\nthe last episode we discussed\nthe service integrator and\n\n58\n00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.730\nwho that is, or rather what that is and\nwhat that role does.\n\n59\n00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.920\nAnd now this is where I get\nto put Justin on the spot\n\n60\n00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.580\nbecause now I can ask Justin what he\nremembers about the service integrator.\n\n61\n00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.360\n&gt;&gt; Well I remember that they\nare the individuals that\n\n62\n00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.870\ninterface with the customer organization,\nbut also with the respective services, and\n\n63\n00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.550\nthey kinda bring things together.\n\n64\n00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.120\nThey remove the barriers for\n\n65\n00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.920\nthe customers, but they also make sure\nthat everybody else works together on\n\n66\n00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.942\nthe other side to deliver on their\nrespective guarantees, right?\n\n67\n00:03:31.942 --> 00:03:36.980\nYeah, yeah, although there's one\nproblem that I've got with that.\n\n68\n00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.000\nSo don't look so happy.\n\n69\n00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.180\n&gt;&gt; That I said it?\n\n70\n00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.359\nI don't know.\n[LAUGH]\n\n71\n00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.330\n&gt;&gt; You used one word and\n\n72\n00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.440\nI'm sure you now what word he used.\n\n73\n00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.960\nIt's the word I absolutely can't\nstand when it comes to IT and\n\n74\n00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.519\nthe one thing that we\nshould never do in IT.\n\n75\n00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.520\nWhich is that word guarantee Justin.\n\n76\n00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.470\nThis is IT, we can't guarantee anything.\n\n77\n00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.935\nWe like to use the word ensure.\n\n78\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.780\nYeah?\nYeah, we wanna ensure.\n\n79\n00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.455\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm real bad about over\npromising and under delivering.\n\n80\n00:04:06.455 --> 00:04:10.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe that's where I'm going wrong.\n\n81\n00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.549\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n82\n00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.320\nYeah, again, maybe it's just\ndown to the language type thing.\n\n83\n00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.980\nBut to me, guarantee means then that's\na promise, that's a commitment.\n\n84\n00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.690\nAnd despite the fact that when we\ntalk about service level agreements,\n\n85\n00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.170\nit's still a promise.\n\n86\n00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.130\nIt's still a commitment.\n\n87\n00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.060\nAnd we can't 100%,\nwith certainty, accuracy,\n\n88\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.860\netc., we cannot promise\n100% to deliver everything.\n\n89\n00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.017\nSo yeah we don't like to\nuse the word guarantee.\n\n90\n00:04:37.017 --> 00:04:38.177\nWe want to ensure.\n\n91\n00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:43.090\nWe want to ensure that we deliver services\nto the agreed service level agreement.\n\n92\n00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.920\nAnd if we can we wanna try and\nexceed that but\n\n93\n00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.390\nnevertheless we don't wanna guarantee it.\n\n94\n00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.500\nBut yeah,\nyou were right about everything else.\n\n95\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.765\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think this might come down\nto language semantics again, Jo.\n\n96\n00:04:53.765 --> 00:04:57.832\nCuz where I'm from,\nguarantees aren't necessarily always 100%.\n\n97\n00:04:57.832 --> 00:05:00.230\n&gt;&gt; That's not semantics.\n\n98\n00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.685\nThat's just wrong.\n\n99\n00:05:01.685 --> 00:05:03.375\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's colloquialisms, Jo.\n\n100\n00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:05.220\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is that what it is?\n\n101\n00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.750\nOkay, then.\n\n102\n00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.490\n&gt;&gt; That's kinda like, where I'm from, when\nI say a couple, that could be 2 up to 600.\n\n103\n00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.020\n&gt;&gt; Actually,\n\n104\n00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.350\nI'm okay with that one as well because\nthat's how I was brought up, right?\n\n105\n00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.820\nJust a couple, it's like when I used\nto get sent down to the store when I\n\n106\n00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.150\nwas a little kid, you know?\n\n107\n00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.960\nYou can get yourself a couple of sweets or\ncandy.\n\n108\n00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.430\nThat meant a bag full about 20.\n\n109\n00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.220\nYeah, that's fine.\n\n110\n00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there's some ambiguity,\nbut I get what you're saying, right?\n\n111\n00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.500\nYou need to pick language\nthat appropriately\n\n112\n00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.860\nprovides your intentions, right?\n\n113\n00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.980\nWithout setting inappropriate\nexpectations, I guess.\n\n114\n00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.780\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's about expectation setting.\n\n115\n00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.400\nAnd also I just wanna remind\nyou that this is an accredited,\n\n116\n00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.350\nit's a certified class and\nwe've got an exam.\n\n117\n00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.580\nAnd you know what,\njust a little bit of an exam tip here.\n\n118\n00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.950\nIf ever you see the word\nguarantee in an exam answer,\n\n119\n00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.920\nrun away kicking and screaming very,\n\n120\n00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.540\nvery quickly from that answer,\nbecause we can't guarantee anything.\n\n121\n00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.080\nSo it is important sometimes\nthe language that we use.\n\n122\n00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.640\nBut that service integrator,\nyou're right, on everything else.\n\n123\n00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.938\nThat is the role that acts\nas the integration layer.\n\n124\n00:06:12.938 --> 00:06:15.700\nThat acts as the coordinator almost, for\n\n125\n00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.645\nunderneath you'll see that we've\ngot all of these service providers.\n\n126\n00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:20.594\nWe've got a couple in\nthis particular example.\n\n127\n00:06:20.594 --> 00:06:24.851\nWe've got a couple of internal service\nproviders and we've got three or\n\n128\n00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:29.180\na couple should we say of\nexternal service providers, okay?\n\n129\n00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:35.940\nBut what we also have then, is that\nintegrator that acts as that translator.\n\n130\n00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:42.010\nIt's the relationship between the customer\norganization and the service providers.\n\n131\n00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.980\nWe talk about retained capabilities\nwithin the customer organization as well.\n\n132\n00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.341\nWe're not taking away\nanything that they do.\n\n133\n00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:50.020\nThat's the one thing we don't want to do.\n\n134\n00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.660\nBut what we want to do is\nfacilitate the business processes.\n\n135\n00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:00.370\nAnd therefore we want to deliver\nvalue to all of those business units.\n\n136\n00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.660\nSo we don't have five.\n\n137\n00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.210\nWe've got five business units there.\n\n138\n00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.060\nWe don't have five contracts with each,\none with each business unit.\n\n139\n00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.580\nWe will have one.\n\n140\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.400\nWell, it depends on whether the service\nintegrator is internal or external.\n\n141\n00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.320\nBut in this instance,\n\n142\n00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.450\nI'm guessing internal because we got\nsome internal service providers there.\n\n143\n00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.670\nSo we'll have one agreement\nwith the service integrator and\n\n144\n00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:29.160\nthe service integrator looks after all\nof the agreements that lay underneath.\n\n145\n00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.060\nSo between the internal and\nthe external service providers.\n\n146\n00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.960\nAnd so this service integrator\ntakes that accountability.\n\n147\n00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.450\nAnd what we're doing is we're just\ntaking that away from the business and\n\n148\n00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.780\njust saying simply, leave it to us.\n\n149\n00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.620\nWe'll deal with that.\n\n150\n00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.331\nWe'll handle that for you.\n\n151\n00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:47.301\nYou don't need to worry about it.\n\n152\n00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:49.181\nWhat's happened in, and\n\n153\n00:07:49.181 --> 00:07:53.796\nI come across this in a lot of\norganizations that I consult with,\n\n154\n00:07:53.796 --> 00:07:59.450\nthat I go on site with, and what tends\nto have happened is that traditionally.\n\n155\n00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.467\n&gt;&gt; We have this internal\nservice provider and\n\n156\n00:08:02.467 --> 00:08:07.244\nthe internal service provider simply\ncan't keep up with demand and\n\n157\n00:08:07.244 --> 00:08:12.269\nwhat tends to happen is that those\nbusiness units that you see up there,\n\n158\n00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:18.430\nthey'll go off somewhere themselves and\nthey will approach suppliers directly.\n\n159\n00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.950\nBecause lets face it, everybody\nhas some knowledge of IT nowadays.\n\n160\n00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.360\nWe all go out and buy our cellphones.\n\n161\n00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.910\nWe've all got PCs at home.\n\n162\n00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.610\nWe've all got tablets at home.\n\n163\n00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:33.810\nWe've all got quite a good knowledge\nof IT not necessarily of IT for\n\n164\n00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:34.650\nthe organization.\n\n165\n00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:39.710\nI mean, I don't expect everybody to\nbe DBAs and I don't expect regular\n\n166\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:45.130\nbusiness individuals to understand\ncybersecurity, that sort of thing.\n\n167\n00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.900\nBut nevertheless,\nthey have a fairly good knowledge of IT.\n\n168\n00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:55.580\nSo imagine what happens when a business\nunit approaches the internal IT service\n\n169\n00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:01.900\nprovider and they say, right,\nwe like an application to do x, y and zed.\n\n170\n00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.680\nOr X, Y and\nZ as you might say in your language\n\n171\n00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.640\nnow that we're talking languages and they\napproach the internal service provider.\n\n172\n00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.770\nAnd the internal service provider,\ndepending on who they are.\n\n173\n00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.903\nAnd if they're in government,\nfor instance, it's not so\n\n174\n00:09:15.903 --> 00:09:18.170\neasy just to bring something in tomorrow.\n\n175\n00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.318\nAnd what happens is the internal service\nprovider kinda scratches their chin and\n\n176\n00:09:22.318 --> 00:09:24.210\nlooks and goes well, you know what?\n\n177\n00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.050\nI can do that in about, I don't know.\n\n178\n00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:30.010\nMaybe two years or so,\nwhat's gonna happen?\n\n179\n00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:34.190\nWell, the business unit, they're gonna\noutside and that's exactly what they do.\n\n180\n00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.134\nAnd they'll go outside, but\n\n181\n00:09:36.134 --> 00:09:39.800\nthey go outside with limited\nIT knowledge themselves.\n\n182\n00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.069\nSo they start negotiating contracts\nwith external service providers.\n\n183\n00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.923\nNumber one, the business unit\nmight know what they want.\n\n184\n00:09:48.923 --> 00:09:54.030\nBut they don't necessarily\nknow what our IT looks like.\n\n185\n00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.780\nThey don't know what's\non the infrastructure.\n\n186\n00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.020\nThey don't know anything about\nthe security of our infrastructure.\n\n187\n00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:05.780\nThey don't know how our infrastructure is\nsetup and what our service look like, etc.\n\n188\n00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.732\nThey don't know even basic things\nlike car operating system and\n\n189\n00:10:09.732 --> 00:10:13.406\nwhat firewalls we have in place,\none of that sort of thing.\n\n190\n00:10:13.406 --> 00:10:17.970\nBut nevertheless, they're gonna go away\nand they're gonna negotiate a contract\n\n191\n00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.200\ndirectly from the business\nunit to the supplier.\n\n192\n00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.285\nThey negotiate this directly\nwith that supplier and\n\n193\n00:10:24.285 --> 00:10:29.480\nthat supplier then releases\nan application onto our infrastructure\n\n194\n00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.340\nbypassing all of our firewall,\nbypassing just about everything that\n\n195\n00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.810\nwe’ve put in place which is a complete\nexposure for our infrastructure.\n\n196\n00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.420\nYou can just imagine the sort\nof chaos that ensues and\n\n197\n00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:47.330\nalso the danger and the risk that\nthat our poses to our infrastructure.\n\n198\n00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.320\nWell, that happens quite often,\nbelieve or not and I have been into some\n\n199\n00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.810\norganizations fairly recently, in fact,\nwhere exactly that has happened.\n\n200\n00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.870\nAnd they've ended up in a bit of,\nwell, I'm gonna say,\n\n201\n00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.520\nin a bit of a pickle to be honest.\n\n202\n00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:06.210\nBecause what you've done is where you've\ngot these external service providers,\n\n203\n00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.350\nyou've got those orange service providers.\n\n204\n00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:13.680\nWe've got direct links between the\nbusiness units and the service providers,\n\n205\n00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.170\ncompletely bypassing IT.\n\n206\n00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:19.456\nBut yet, everything sat on the\ninfrastructure and then we get a virus and\n\n207\n00:11:19.456 --> 00:11:21.780\nno one knows where it came from.\n\n208\n00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:26.720\n&gt;&gt; So Jo, these are times where individual\nbusiness units going out and negotiating\n\n209\n00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.400\nthese contracts causes an embrittlement of\nthe respective organization as a whole.\n\n210\n00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.970\nWe could have duplication of services and\neven without security concerns or\n\n211\n00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:40.550\nany of that, we still kinda have like a,\nall right, no one touch anything.\n\n212\n00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.610\nBecause if this goes down,\n\n213\n00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:47.330\nwe can't fulfill our respective\nbusiness units's requirements.\n\n214\n00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:51.010\n&gt;&gt; Well, let me give you an example that I\ncame across actually quite recently with\n\n215\n00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:56.050\nan organization where\nthe organization had really decided\n\n216\n00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:00.310\nthat IT wasn't quick enough to respond\nbecause of the environment they were in.\n\n217\n00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.170\nSo every single business\nunit had to go on out and\n\n218\n00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.100\nthey had not just sort of gone out,\n\n219\n00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:09.760\nand looked for individual solutions or\nsmall solutions to certain applications.\n\n220\n00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.530\nKind of the example that I gave you was\n\n221\n00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:15.700\nthe business unit wants\na particular application.\n\n222\n00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.130\nBut in this instance,\nthe business themselves,\n\n223\n00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:22.330\neach business unit has gone out to\norganizations like SAP for instance.\n\n224\n00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.960\nSo we're talking about the big boys here.\n\n225\n00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.539\nWe're not just talking about individual\napplications and SAP had come in, and\n\n226\n00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:32.590\nthey done some work, and they had\nimplemented financials as they do.\n\n227\n00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:37.440\nAnd then they brought in somebody else and\nthey implemented something really big.\n\n228\n00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.840\nAnd of course, IT was struggling\nthen to manage the infrastructure.\n\n229\n00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.709\nBecause IT had that responsibility for\nthe infrastructure and\n\n230\n00:12:45.709 --> 00:12:49.730\nthey had the responsibility for\nall of our underlying services.\n\n231\n00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.731\nI'm not just talking about service,\n\n232\n00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:56.043\nbut I'm talking about things like data\nstorage and backups, etc., and then SAP\n\n233\n00:12:56.043 --> 00:13:00.250\nwill run a completely different contract\nthat IT didn't know anything about.\n\n234\n00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.480\nAnd therefore,\nevery time they made a change,\n\n235\n00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.940\nit affected all their applications\non the infrastructure.\n\n236\n00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.860\nSo it's not just like\nyou say about security.\n\n237\n00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.050\nIt's about all of\nthe other implications too.\n\n238\n00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:17.960\nAnd then of course, SAP agreed to and\nthis is just an example.\n\n239\n00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.517\nBut SAP agreed to a three\nhour response window for\n\n240\n00:13:21.517 --> 00:13:26.570\nincidents which is fine, but\nthe customer got three hours with SAP.\n\n241\n00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.142\nAnd then when they spoke to an internal\nIT department, they got four hours.\n\n242\n00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.920\nHow do they make the internal\nIT department look?\n\n243\n00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.520\nThey'd already were looking not\nparticularly great which is what prompted\n\n244\n00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.340\nthe business units to go direct\nto the external suppliers.\n\n245\n00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.070\nBut now the external suppliers were\noffering more than what the internal IT\n\n246\n00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.350\ndepartment were giving.\n\n247\n00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:53.440\nAnd therefore, the internal IT\ndepartment looked even worse.\n\n248\n00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.890\nSo it causes problems and\nthis is why we want to bring in that\n\n249\n00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:02.350\nintegrator layer that says, look,\nyou might have your internal IT.\n\n250\n00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.540\nBut somebody's got to organize this.\n\n251\n00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.750\nIn this particular organization,\nI have to say were in a bit of,\n\n252\n00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.040\nlet's just say, they were in chaos.\n\n253\n00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:16.070\nAnd they were in a permanent\nstate of chaos and it actually\n\n254\n00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:20.500\nthen got to the point where it prevented\ntheir business from moving forward.\n\n255\n00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.110\nIT is no longer.\n\n256\n00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:25.370\nThis is not the 1980s.\n\n257\n00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:29.530\nIT is not just a necessary evil\nthat sits in the background and\n\n258\n00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.690\nsort of chugs along and\ndoes little bits of processing.\n\n259\n00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:36.267\nIT is an integral part of every\nsingle organization nowadays and\n\n260\n00:14:36.267 --> 00:14:38.330\nwe can't afford to have that chaos.\n\n261\n00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.106\nYou simply can't.\n\n262\n00:14:40.106 --> 00:14:46.450\nSo ecosystem or ecosystem will\nactually consist of these layers.\n\n263\n00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.879\nThe customer layer,\nthe service integrator layer and\n\n264\n00:14:49.879 --> 00:14:53.765\nthen the service provider layer\nwhich was that bottom layer.\n\n265\n00:14:53.765 --> 00:14:57.980\nAnd so as I've all ready mentioned,\nthe customer organization.\n\n266\n00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.053\nWell, that's the end client and\n\n267\n00:15:01.053 --> 00:15:06.000\nthe end client that's this\nparticular client here.\n\n268\n00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.868\nThe customer organization\nis the client that is\n\n269\n00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:15.858\nmaking the decision to\nmove from the traditional\n\n270\n00:15:15.858 --> 00:15:21.150\ninternal service provider\nto the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n271\n00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:24.801\nNow that's an interesting statement,\nby the way, and\n\n272\n00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:28.150\nI just wanna rephrase this or\nrather reinforce it.\n\n273\n00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.940\nThe customer organization\nmakes the decision.\n\n274\n00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.530\nOf course, they do.\n\n275\n00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:38.830\nLet's think about this realistically\nspeaking and the customer organization.\n\n276\n00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.490\nThey're the ones with a budget.\n\n277\n00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.150\nThey're the ones that give IT the budget.\n\n278\n00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.510\nPut my teeth in in a minute.\n\n279\n00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:49.788\n[LAUGH] The customer is the one\nthat gives IT the budget.\n\n280\n00:15:49.788 --> 00:15:53.634\nThe customer makes the decisions and\nit's the customer,\n\n281\n00:15:53.634 --> 00:15:58.188\nthe business units that invariably\ngo outside of IT if they don't get\n\n282\n00:15:58.188 --> 00:16:02.070\nwhat they need to be able\nto deliver their outcomes.\n\n283\n00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:05.783\nAnd so\nit's the customer that makes the decision.\n\n284\n00:16:05.783 --> 00:16:11.084\nSo the customer decides whether to move to\n\n285\n00:16:11.084 --> 00:16:16.847\nthe SIAM methodology or\nthe SIAM hierarchy.\n\n286\n00:16:16.847 --> 00:16:20.704\nIt's the customer that decides\nthat they want to go outside and\n\n287\n00:16:20.704 --> 00:16:25.550\nthey want to bring somebody who\nunderstands what it is they require.\n\n288\n00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:30.510\nThey want to move to a methodology and\na structure that\n\n289\n00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:35.770\ngives them, well, organization,\nthat gets rid of the chaos.\n\n290\n00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:39.320\nSo it's the customer\nthat makes the decision.\n\n291\n00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:44.010\n&gt;&gt; So Jo, customer organizations is making\nall of this decisions but along those\n\n292\n00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:49.030\ndecisions, I see this little green box, is\nthat part of that decision making process?\n\n293\n00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.640\nThis retained capabilities.\n\n294\n00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.450\n&gt;&gt; Right, I'm glad you ask that actually,\nthat green box, look at this,\n\n295\n00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.890\nI've got a slide already prepare for you.\n\n296\n00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:05.570\nRetained Capabilities are really those\ndecisions that the customer will retain.\n\n297\n00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:09.420\nWell, that's why it's called retained,\nlet's face it, I mean it's obvious.\n\n298\n00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.950\nSuch as strategic decisions,\ngovernance decisions,\n\n299\n00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.560\ncontract management, procurement,\nfinancial management,\n\n300\n00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.850\neven portfolio management, which is\nabout which new services to bring in.\n\n301\n00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:26.260\nAnd we'll see those particular\nprocesses a little bit later on in\n\n302\n00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:30.950\nthe subsequent episode where we're\ngoing to look at portfolio management.\n\n303\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:34.200\nWe're gonna look at financial management,\nbut all of those decisions that you see on\n\n304\n00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.300\nthe screen in front of you,\nthey're retained by the customer.\n\n305\n00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.800\nThe service provider, or\n\n306\n00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.150\nrather, the service integrator\ndoes not make those decisions.\n\n307\n00:17:44.202 --> 00:17:49.350\nSo at the service integrator, what they do\nis they integrate the relationship between\n\n308\n00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:53.970\nall of those vendors,\nall of those suppliers.\n\n309\n00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:54.987\nThat's what they do.\n\n310\n00:17:54.987 --> 00:17:59.073\nAnd they make sure that all of\nthe vendors, all of the suppliers,\n\n311\n00:17:59.073 --> 00:18:02.550\ncontribute towards that\nend-to-end service.\n\n312\n00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:06.820\nIn other words, that they deliver\ncollectively and collaboratively,\n\n313\n00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:13.030\nI like the use of that word, they deliver\ncollaboratively value to the organization.\n\n314\n00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:17.380\nIt is not the role of the customer\nto take that responsibility.\n\n315\n00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:21.590\nIt's not up to you to work out which\nphone number you've got to call,\n\n316\n00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:25.015\nit's up to to the integrator.\n\n317\n00:18:25.015 --> 00:18:28.945\nThey give you one fine number and\nthat service integrator then deals with\n\n318\n00:18:28.945 --> 00:18:31.845\neverything else that's\nhappening in the background.\n\n319\n00:18:31.845 --> 00:18:37.037\nAnd that service integrator, well,\nthat can be provided by one person,\n\n320\n00:18:37.037 --> 00:18:40.627\nor it can be provided by an internal\nperson or an external person.\n\n321\n00:18:40.627 --> 00:18:43.617\nIt can be provided by one person or\na team of people.\n\n322\n00:18:43.617 --> 00:18:44.657\nBut nevertheless,\n\n323\n00:18:44.657 --> 00:18:48.608\nthey act as the translator between\nthe customer requirements and\n\n324\n00:18:49.998 --> 00:18:55.158\nwhat our service providers, our external\nservice providers are actually providing.\n\n325\n00:18:56.298 --> 00:19:01.658\nCuz within a SIAM ecosystem, we're gonna\nhave more than one service provider.\n\n326\n00:19:01.658 --> 00:19:06.008\nAnd so I've got some service provider\ntypes here, on the screen in front of you,\n\n327\n00:19:06.008 --> 00:19:11.420\nand even though these\nprovider types are managed\n\n328\n00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:16.115\nby individual service providers,\nthey're managed by individual suppliers,\n\n329\n00:19:16.115 --> 00:19:20.990\nnevertheless, it's the service\nintegrators that manages all of this.\n\n330\n00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:24.730\nSo you can see that these are just,\nby the way, examples.\n\n331\n00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:29.510\nThings like desktop services,\ndata centers, hosting, security.\n\n332\n00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:34.480\nThese are just examples of what we might\ngive to individual service providers.\n\n333\n00:19:35.588 --> 00:19:39.320\nWe might get one service provider to\ntake responsibility for security, and\n\n334\n00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.730\nanother service provider\nto take responsibility for\n\n335\n00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.290\nhosting, and somebody else to\ntake responsibility for data.\n\n336\n00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.260\nMaybe we store that on\nthe cloud somewhere.\n\n337\n00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.300\nSo we have categories\nof service providers.\n\n338\n00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.180\nWe have strategic service provider.\n\n339\n00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:59.260\nWe have tactical service providers and\ncommodity service providers.\n\n340\n00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.850\nWhat do we mean by those?\n\n341\n00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:05.260\nWell, we see a full explanation\nof these service providers.\n\n342\n00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:09.580\nAgain, if we go back to ITIL,\nand in our ITIL series,\n\n343\n00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.000\nwe look at categorizing our suppliers.\n\n344\n00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.502\nThis is exactly what we're doing here.\n\n345\n00:20:15.502 --> 00:20:20.860\nA commodity supplier is a service\nsupplier that is supplying something\n\n346\n00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:27.050\nthat has low risk to the organization and\nhas low impact to the organization.\n\n347\n00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:32.325\nSo the person that supplying our paper for\nour printers, for instance,\n\n348\n00:20:32.325 --> 00:20:36.835\nto the organization if they fail and\nnot important to the organization.\n\n349\n00:20:36.835 --> 00:20:41.630\nThe organization doesn't really\ncare where they get the.\n\n350\n00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:45.390\nBut then let's take a look at when\nwe talk about software as a service,\n\n351\n00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:46.930\nlet's take a look at Microsoft.\n\n352\n00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:52.517\nAnd Microsoft may be supplying our\norganization with maybe Office 365.\n\n353\n00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:57.131\nSo they may be supplying our\norganization with a full service for\n\n354\n00:20:57.131 --> 00:21:00.730\nemail and for\nall of our OfficeSuite of products.\n\n355\n00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.370\nYou know the ones, Word and Excel, etc.\n\n356\n00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:09.830\nIn which case, it's high risk to\nthe organization if there is a failure,\n\n357\n00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:14.930\nand it's highly important to\nthe organization, as well.\n\n358\n00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:19.140\nWe call them a strategic service provider,\nand\n\n359\n00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:23.370\nthis is where our service\nintegrator comes in.\n\n360\n00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:28.220\nBecause they manage all of our service\nproviders, because you see, we may have\n\n361\n00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:33.760\nanother service provider that's providing\nthat middle layer, that tactical layer.\n\n362\n00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.080\nAnd that service provider may be\nproviding us with say printers, and\n\n363\n00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.840\nprinters for all of our offices.\n\n364\n00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.700\nWell, of course,\n\n365\n00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:45.630\nthat tactical service provider is going\nto be reliant on the commodity service\n\n366\n00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.490\nprovider because the printers aren't gonna\nwork if they've got no paper in them.\n\n367\n00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:53.800\nAnd it's down to the service\nintegrator to actually manage\n\n368\n00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.010\nthe relationship between all of\nthose types of service provider.\n\n369\n00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.210\nAnd if you're gonna\nmanage your relationship,\n\n370\n00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:05.150\nthen you've got to\nunderstand the relationship.\n\n371\n00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:07.710\nAnd that's exactly what the service\nintegrator is going to do.\n\n372\n00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.750\nSo what we gonna do now is we're gonna\ntake a break in this particular episode.\n\n373\n00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:18.610\nAlthough I did see Justin look as\nthough he was about to ask a question.\n\n374\n00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.520\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think you kinda touched on it.\n\n375\n00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.680\nI was gonna ask about\nthe service integrators.\n\n376\n00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:29.080\nThey have to have the domain specific\nknowledge about the customer organization\n\n377\n00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.900\nand how the respective service\nproviders fit within that organization.\n\n378\n00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:38.750\nSo would you say there's typically not\na very general line of integration layers?\n\n379\n00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:42.470\nIt's more highly specialized given\nthe customer organization systems?\n\n380\n00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:45.549\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely so.\n\n381\n00:22:45.549 --> 00:22:47.336\nI use the word translator and\n\n382\n00:22:47.336 --> 00:22:50.850\nI always refer to a service\nintegrator as a translator.\n\n383\n00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:54.360\nBecause they've got to be able\nto speak the customer language,\n\n384\n00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.600\nthe business language.\n\n385\n00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.620\nBut then they have to be\nincredibly specialize.\n\n386\n00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.480\nThey have to understand\nthe dependencies between the different\n\n387\n00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.530\ntypes of service provider.\n\n388\n00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:06.590\nAnd I just mentioned at a very,\nvery high level,\n\n389\n00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:12.117\nlet's say our tactical service provider,\nthe person providing us with the printers,\n\n390\n00:23:12.117 --> 00:23:15.193\nis completely dependent\non the paper supplier.\n\n391\n00:23:15.193 --> 00:23:17.720\nAnd if the paper supplier\ndoesn't supply paper,\n\n392\n00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.060\nthen unfortunately the printers\naren't going to work.\n\n393\n00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.450\nAnd so\nit's down to the service integrator to\n\n394\n00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:29.210\nunderstand how all of these fit\ntogether at a detailed level.\n\n395\n00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:31.920\nNow, that's a detailed level\nin terms of the contract,\n\n396\n00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:37.080\nand also maybe a detailed level in terms\nof sorta technical requirements, as well.\n\n397\n00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.310\nBecause if you're talking about\ndependencies between say the operating\n\n398\n00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:45.360\nsystem and an application such as SAP,\nfor instance, then I'd expect\n\n399\n00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:51.470\nthat service integrator to be able to\nidentify any gaps in the contracts.\n\n400\n00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.500\nBecause the one thing that we don't want\nis that situation where we get one service\n\n401\n00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.200\nprovider say,\nthat's not my problem, it's theirs.\n\n402\n00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.180\nAnd then the other one's saying,\nit's not my problem, it's theirs.\n\n403\n00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:05.128\nSo the service integrate is gonna be\ntechnical enough to identify those gaps.\n\n404\n00:24:05.128 --> 00:24:09.630\n&gt;&gt; And a follow-up question about\nthose respective service providers, so\n\n405\n00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.410\nwhen I think commodoties,\nand just bear with me here,\n\n406\n00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.150\nwe talked about the printer paper, right?\n\n407\n00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:15.680\nDelivering on these\nrespective commodities,\n\n408\n00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.960\nthey should be low-impact to the business.\n\n409\n00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.680\nIf I have a consumable product that\nhas a high impact to the business,\n\n410\n00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.590\nthat is not a commodity service provider.\n\n411\n00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.840\nAm I misunderstanding that?\n\n412\n00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.850\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n413\n00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:31.600\nWe get hung up on terms and\ndefinitions here.\n\n414\n00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.750\nAnd of course, when it comes to your test,\nwhat I expect you to be able to understand\n\n415\n00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:41.580\nis the importance, and the relevance\nof these types of service provider.\n\n416\n00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.270\nThe actual labels that you give them,\nyou know what?\n\n417\n00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:45.580\nI don't care.\n\n418\n00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.690\nIn terms of the test, yes, they're gonna\ntest that you understand the difference.\n\n419\n00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:53.630\nBut in the real world, when you adapt\nthis to use in your environment,\n\n420\n00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:58.340\nwe're not necessarily gonna be\nusing essentially those labels.\n\n421\n00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.030\nBut yes, commodity service provider\n\n422\n00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:05.280\nis anybody that doesn't have\na high impact to the organization.\n\n423\n00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:10.470\nSo for instance, and I mentioned paper,\nwell, paper's not important, so\n\n424\n00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:16.830\ntherefore we can go down to any shop and\nbuy some paper if we run out of paper.\n\n425\n00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.320\nBut that's not strictly true.\n\n426\n00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.340\nBecause if we were working at\na utility company for instance and\n\n427\n00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:26.330\nwe did paper billing every month and\nwe run out of the continuous feed paper\n\n428\n00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.730\nthat we use then in that case then,\nactually,\n\n429\n00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:34.666\nthat's more of a strategic supplier,\nrather than a commodity supplier.\n\n430\n00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:38.980\nSo yes, it's a combination of\n\n431\n00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:44.040\nthe impact to the organization and the\nimportance to the organization, as well.\n\n432\n00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.617\nBut for now, I'm gonna stop you\nfrom asking anymore questions.\n\n433\n00:25:48.617 --> 00:25:49.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I think for\n\n434\n00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.577\nnow we're gonna wrap up this episode.\n\n435\n00:25:51.577 --> 00:25:55.704\nAnd then when we come back, we're gonna\ntake a greater look into the composition\n\n436\n00:25:55.704 --> 00:25:58.405\nof SIAM and what it's actually made of.\n\n437\n00:25:58.405 --> 00:26:01.815\n&gt;&gt; Well Jo, you've definitely set us up\nto have a little bit of a cliffhanger.\n\n438\n00:26:01.815 --> 00:26:03.546\nI definitely have some more questions, and\n\n439\n00:26:03.546 --> 00:26:06.459\nhopefully you have some more questions\nthat need to be answered, right?\n\n440\n00:26:06.459 --> 00:26:10.149\nWe're just really starting to get\ninto the weeds, so to speak, but\n\n441\n00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:11.655\nwe have a lot further to go.\n\n442\n00:26:11.655 --> 00:26:14.575\nSo definitely join us in part two, but for\nthis episode, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n443\n00:26:14.575 --> 00:26:15.355\nwrap it up.\n\n444\n00:26:15.355

00:00:08.078\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.078 --> 00:00:12.977\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:12.977 --> 00:00:16.240\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.720\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison and\nwe're continuing on with Siam Foundation.\n\n7\n00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.660\nI didn't put the S on it that time and\n\n8\n00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.880\nparticularly we're gonna be looking\nat Siam practices in this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.220\nAnd here to help us along\nwith that is Ms Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.390\nHow you doing to day, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; I am absolutely fantastic,\n\n11\n00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.440\nthank you for asking, Justin.\n\n12\n00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.790\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing well myself.\n\n13\n00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.386\nNow, Siam practices.\n\n14\n00:00:35.386 --> 00:00:39.513\nI'm rather intrigued by\nthis pattern of making sure\n\n15\n00:00:39.513 --> 00:00:43.746\neverything is in this service and\nintegrator level.\n\n16\n00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:46.231\nI’m guessing we’re going\nto talk more about that, or\n\n17\n00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:49.210\nam I getting ahead of myself.\n&gt;&gt; Just a little bit, yes.\n\n18\n00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.050\nWe’re not necessarily going to talk\nabout the service integrator too much.\n\n19\n00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.070\nWhat we’re going to do is we’re going\nto look at the methodology itself, and\n\n20\n00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.660\nwhat the methodology is made up of, and\n\n21\n00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.330\nso the first thing that I want to,\nwell the first theme.\n\n22\n00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.330\nI'm gonna say theme.\n\n23\n00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.280\nThat I want to bring into this particular\nepisode is what SIAM actually covers.\n\n24\n00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.410\nSo, we know that SIAM is\na management methodology.\n\n25\n00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.270\nAnd so, SIAM itself covers,\nwell, the following,\n\n26\n00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.810\nit's on the screen right in front of you,\nbecause, there we go, look at that, see?\n\n27\n00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.820\nI'm always impressed, by the way,\nby our directors, I don't know about you.\n\n28\n00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.670\nThey seem to know exactly what\nit is that we're thinking.\n\n29\n00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.100\nAnd for me, that's quite an achievement.\n\n30\n00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.150\nAnybody can get inside my brain deserves\na medal as far as I'm concerned.\n\n31\n00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.710\nDon't say a word, Justin.\n\n32\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.500\n[LAUGH] So, our makeup of SIAM,\nif you could see the face that I could see\n\n33\n00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.200\nright now you'd understand\nwhy I'm laughing.\n\n34\n00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.860\nSIAM itself is, well,\nwhat does it encompass?\n\n35\n00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.970\nWe have to manage both the practices,\nworking practices,\n\n36\n00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.390\nand the processes, and the functions, and\nthe roles, and the structural elements of.\n\n37\n00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.630\nThe service providers.\n\n38\n00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.250\nNot just the service integrator,\nbut the service providers as well.\n\n39\n00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.580\nSo, yeah, you're right, Justin, in that\nit refers to the service integrator, but\n\n40\n00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.360\nwe're managing these elements, and a lot\nof these elements are actually being.\n\n41\n00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.310\nWell, supplied by our service providers\nand our external service providers.\n\n42\n00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.370\nSo, let's just take a look\nat this particular slide.\n\n43\n00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.910\nAnd if we can put this on\nto full screen right now,\n\n44\n00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.730\nthen you can see that we're\nlooking at our practices.\n\n45\n00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.970\nNow, by the way, Justin, what is\nthe difference between a practice and\n\n46\n00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.120\na process?\n&gt;&gt; Well, a practice and\n\n47\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.490\na process, eh.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n48\n00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.600\n&gt;&gt; A process is a documented set of\n\n49\n00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.815\npractices, and-\n\n50\n00:02:44.815 --> 00:02:45.647\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n51\n00:02:45.647 --> 00:02:46.930\n[LAUGH] You're throwing me under\n\n52\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.060\nthe bus here.\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n53\n00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.120\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I'm gonna\n\n54\n00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.622\nget this wrong regardless of what I say.\n\n55\n00:02:51.622 --> 00:02:52.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, no,\n\n56\n00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.700\nit's quite interesting.\n\n57\n00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.860\nI did throw you under the bus, and\nthere's a reason why I did that now.\n\n58\n00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.470\nA process is a structured set of\nactivities, it's something that we do.\n\n59\n00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.010\nWorking practices as we like to call them,\nthey're not necessarily structured.\n\n60\n00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.650\nWe have our standard operating practices,\nand our standard operating procedures.\n\n61\n00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.770\nAnd so,\nthese exist almost within our processes,\n\n62\n00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.830\nbut they also exist, well, as a governance\nstructure for our processes too.\n\n63\n00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.540\nSo, we have ways of working.\n\n64\n00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.530\nSo, for instance if I were to look at and\none of the processes is that's one on\n\n65\n00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.740\nthe screen right now is for\ninstance change management.\n\n66\n00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.320\nNow, change management\nis a set of activities.\n\n67\n00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.030\nSo, it's something that we follow.\n\n68\n00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.630\nBut we may do it in a certain way, so\nfor instance in our people practices,\n\n69\n00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.880\nwe might have a practice to deal\nwith people that says, well,\n\n70\n00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.270\npeople who will only work between the\nhours of 8:30 in the morning and 17:30.\n\n71\n00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.770\nIn which case, then the people practices\nhas an influence on our processes,\n\n72\n00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.630\nbecause change management then can only\nwork between the hours of 8:30 and 17:30.\n\n73\n00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.269\nSo, think of our practices\nbeing a governance,\n\n74\n00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.176\nit's something that I\nwouldn't say dictates, but\n\n75\n00:04:12.176 --> 00:04:17.800\nit's something that drives the way we\nwork whereas a process is what we do.\n\n76\n00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.982\nAnd then, we've got functions, and\na function is a group of people, and\n\n77\n00:04:21.982 --> 00:04:23.670\nthe tools that they use.\n\n78\n00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.666\nSo, a function is a team,\nit's a functional area.\n\n79\n00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:31.941\nAnd within a team and within a role\nwe have, sorry, within a team and\n\n80\n00:04:31.941 --> 00:04:35.446\nwithin a process even, [LAUGH] now see\nlook, I was gonna ask you that, and\n\n81\n00:04:35.446 --> 00:04:36.955\nI've given away the answer.\n\n82\n00:04:36.955 --> 00:04:40.765\n[LAUGH] But within a process and\nwithin a function we've got a role, and\n\n83\n00:04:40.765 --> 00:04:43.682\na role is something that you will do.\n\n84\n00:04:43.682 --> 00:04:48.192\nIt's a set of responsibilities within\neither a team, or within a process.\n\n85\n00:04:48.192 --> 00:04:49.962\nSo, let's go back to change management.\n\n86\n00:04:49.962 --> 00:04:53.512\nAnd in change management what\nwe do is we say log the change,\n\n87\n00:04:53.512 --> 00:04:57.962\nand we will prioritize it and\nwe will categorize it.\n\n88\n00:04:57.962 --> 00:04:58.472\nAnd then,\n\n89\n00:04:58.472 --> 00:05:03.109\nwe will maybe pass that on to our second\nlevel support team to assess that change.\n\n90\n00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.620\nIf I was say the service desk analyst,\n\n91\n00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.910\nthen my role would be to log the change\nand to prioritize hidden your\n\n92\n00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.880\nrole as the second level analysts,\nwould be to assess that particular change.\n\n93\n00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.680\nSo, we have roles within processes, but we\nalso have roles within functional teams.\n\n94\n00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.810\nAnd one of our functional teams\nmaybe the service desk, and\n\n95\n00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.380\nI might have the role of the service\ndesk manager within the service desk.\n\n96\n00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.840\nDoes that make sense?\n&gt;&gt; That's starting to make sense.\n\n97\n00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.250\nLet me make sure that I have this, and\n\n98\n00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.910\ndefinitely correct me if I'm way off base.\n&gt;&gt; You know I\n\n99\n00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:35.410\nwill.\n&gt;&gt; I know you\n\n100\n00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.060\nwill.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n101\n00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.020\n&gt;&gt; And you will do it with disregard for\n\n102\n00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.100\nmy own [LAUGH] my own well-being.\n\n103\n00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.060\n&gt;&gt; Emotions.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n104\n00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.640\n&gt;&gt; Emotions, yeah.\n\n105\n00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.210\n&gt;&gt; And so, practices are how we interface.\n\n106\n00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.200\nHow we conduct processes and\nprocesses are a series of\n\n107\n00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.030\nsteps that in order to achieve some goal.\n\n108\n00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.355\nDo I have that kind of nailed down, or\nam I generalizing a little too much?\n\n109\n00:05:59.355 --> 00:06:00.027\n&gt;&gt; No, no,\n\n110\n00:06:00.027 --> 00:06:03.120\nno I don't mind you generalizing at all.\n\n111\n00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.960\nSee, I told you I was having issues in\nthis particular series I'm having issues\n\n112\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.590\nwith my teeth.\n\n113\n00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.884\nDon't know what it is [LAUGH].\n\n114\n00:06:08.884 --> 00:06:12.596\nI'm gonna give them back to the horse\na little bit later on [LAUGH] that I\n\n115\n00:06:12.596 --> 00:06:13.687\nborrowed the from.\n\n116\n00:06:13.687 --> 00:06:16.890\nNow, practices, think about ethics, yeah?\n\n117\n00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.095\nSo, a work in practice\nis the way that we work.\n\n118\n00:06:20.095 --> 00:06:22.815\nBut the process is what we do.\n\n119\n00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:24.125\nSo, think about our ethics.\n\n120\n00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:28.195\nPeople practices and\ntechnology practices may be our ethics.\n\n121\n00:06:28.195 --> 00:06:32.125\nSo, perhaps we have a technology\npractice to recycle,\n\n122\n00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:35.675\nthen that's an ethic that\nwe have as an organization.\n\n123\n00:06:35.675 --> 00:06:39.480\nNow, invariably and\nI know that we're gonna get into this,\n\n124\n00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.030\nbecause invariably that practice is\ndifferent depending on the organization.\n\n125\n00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.240\nIt also depending on what side\nof the world you're on as well.\n\n126\n00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.640\nSo, I mentioned recycling,\n\n127\n00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.650\nI do that deliberately, because in\ncertain parts of the world, in Europe,\n\n128\n00:06:53.650 --> 00:07:00.650\nin Canada it absolutely mandatory\nto recycle all of your hardware.\n\n129\n00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.460\nSo, if you were undertaking something\nlike a refresh of all of our laptops\n\n130\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.760\nwithin an organization,\nthen if you're in Europe, or\n\n131\n00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.915\nin Canada then it's mandatory to\nrecycle all of your old hardware.\n\n132\n00:07:13.915 --> 00:07:16.815\nNow, that can be incredibly\ndifficult especially in a government\n\n133\n00:07:16.815 --> 00:07:21.235\nenvironment where you've got data,\npotentially, even though you shouldn't.\n\n134\n00:07:21.235 --> 00:07:23.855\nYou might have data on a hard drive.\n\n135\n00:07:25.075 --> 00:07:29.625\nSo, that can be a challenge, but\nit's a legal requirement, it's mandatory.\n\n136\n00:07:29.625 --> 00:07:33.825\nBut then, here we are in the USA,\nand in the USA it's not mandatory.\n\n137\n00:07:33.825 --> 00:07:38.590\nNow, there are some regulations\nin place in some states, but\n\n138\n00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.690\ncertainly not in all states.\n\n139\n00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.941\nSo, an organization that's\na global organization,\n\n140\n00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:46.849\nbecause they've gotta\nrecycle in one country.\n\n141\n00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:51.371\nThen what they probably will do is they\nwill impose a technology practice,\n\n142\n00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:54.454\nan ethic, and\nthat ethic will say, right, well,\n\n143\n00:07:54.454 --> 00:07:59.148\nwe're gonna recycle across the board.\n&gt;&gt; No matter where we are it is our ethic\n\n144\n00:07:59.148 --> 00:08:03.890\nas an organization to recycle, because\nit makes it easier from a governance\n\n145\n00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:08.629\nperspective to ensure that we've got\nthat same ethic that goes right the way\n\n146\n00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:12.851\nacross the board than what it is to\nmanage different regulations and\n\n147\n00:08:12.851 --> 00:08:16.870\ndifferent legislation\nin different countries.\n\n148\n00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.807\nSo that's what we mean by practice.\n\n149\n00:08:18.807 --> 00:08:22.083\nWell, there's a process,\nthere's something that we do and\n\n150\n00:08:22.083 --> 00:08:24.170\nit's something that's incredibly.\n\n151\n00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.574\nI was just gonna use the word tangible,\nbut practices tend to be tangible as well.\n\n152\n00:08:28.574 --> 00:08:30.550\nBut our processes are defined.\n\n153\n00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:35.522\nThey're written down and\nthey achieve a specific objective.\n\n154\n00:08:35.522 --> 00:08:37.569\nThey deliver a specific outcome.\n\n155\n00:08:37.569 --> 00:08:39.691\nDoes that make sense?\n&gt;&gt; So in this case,\n\n156\n00:08:39.691 --> 00:08:44.229\nif we carry on with this, would I have\na process that helps me like make sure\n\n157\n00:08:44.229 --> 00:08:48.890\nthat I'm following the recycling\npractice that may be imposed upon us?\n\n158\n00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.326\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, so\n\n159\n00:08:50.326 --> 00:08:53.287\nthe process tells us how we do something.\n\n160\n00:08:53.287 --> 00:08:57.933\nSo the practice will tell us what we do\nand the process will tell us how we do it,\n\n161\n00:08:57.933 --> 00:09:02.722\nand then the functions of the groups of\npeople that do it including the tools that\n\n162\n00:09:02.722 --> 00:09:05.600\nthey may used to facilitate that as well.\n\n163\n00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.874\nAnd so different people within\nthose functional areas.\n\n164\n00:09:08.874 --> 00:09:13.098\nSo maybe our desktop supporting and\ndifferent people in the desktop support\n\n165\n00:09:13.098 --> 00:09:16.780\nteam will have different roles\ninvolved in that recycling.\n\n166\n00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.583\nSo maybe one person,\nthey're all within desktop support.\n\n167\n00:09:20.583 --> 00:09:21.960\nThat's the function.\n\n168\n00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.727\nOne person will go and collect the laptop,\nand another person will take\n\n169\n00:09:26.727 --> 00:09:30.858\nthe hard drive out of the laptop,\nand another person will take\n\n170\n00:09:30.858 --> 00:09:33.813\nit into the parking lot with a hammer.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n171\n00:09:33.813 --> 00:09:37.340\nthat is definitely some way to\nmake secure data who knows.\n\n172\n00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.407\nBut so rules are specific\nresponsibilities that divinity up\n\n173\n00:09:41.407 --> 00:09:45.327\nwith context of a process what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n174\n00:09:45.327 --> 00:09:47.412\nI know rules are not-\n&gt;&gt; Over with a function yes\n\n175\n00:09:47.412 --> 00:09:48.096\n&gt;&gt; Within a function.\n\n176\n00:09:48.096 --> 00:09:48.953\n&gt;&gt; But-\n\n177\n00:09:48.953 --> 00:09:50.046\n&gt;&gt; So for recycling,\n\n178\n00:09:50.046 --> 00:09:53.360\nI haven't standard process\nthat I have to incorporate.\n\n179\n00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.965\nMaybe blushinning with a hammer, but\nlet's say that all employees have\n\n180\n00:09:57.965 --> 00:10:02.054\na role of like you need to\nbackup all personal information.\n\n181\n00:10:02.054 --> 00:10:06.394\nThat's your responsibility and then it's\nhanded off to a different role inside of\n\n182\n00:10:06.394 --> 00:10:08.936\nthat process like someone's picking it up,\nand\n\n183\n00:10:08.936 --> 00:10:12.170\nthen someone's the destroyer for\nthis respective process.\n\n184\n00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.166\nCorrect?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n185\n00:10:13.166 --> 00:10:17.937\nso I think what you're doing there, be\ncareful is confusing activity with role.\n\n186\n00:10:17.937 --> 00:10:19.009\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n187\n00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:21.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because the role within\n\n188\n00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.700\nthe process might encompass one or\nmore activities.\n\n189\n00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.494\nSo the activity is the thing that they do.\n\n190\n00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:31.850\nThink about the role as\nthe person that does it.\n\n191\n00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.611\nThe designated person that does it.\n\n192\n00:10:33.611 --> 00:10:37.680\nSo for instance, let's think about our\nproduction that we have here right now.\n\n193\n00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.527\nSo at the moment,\n\n194\n00:10:38.527 --> 00:10:42.313\nwhat we're doing is obviously, we're\nrecording an episode within a studio.\n\n195\n00:10:42.313 --> 00:10:46.306\nAnd my role is here as well,\nI'm not too sure, really.\n\n196\n00:10:46.306 --> 00:10:50.142\n[LAUGH] Justin's role is here\njust to infuriate me and\n\n197\n00:10:50.142 --> 00:10:54.588\nthen we also have our director,\nand their role is ensure that\n\n198\n00:10:54.588 --> 00:10:59.580\neverything runs smoothly, and\nthat we don't get to far off track.\n\n199\n00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:01.281\nThat's what they do.\n\n200\n00:11:01.281 --> 00:11:05.420\nThey direct us and they rein us in when\nthings get a little bit ridiculous.\n\n201\n00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.957\nSo these are roles.\n\n202\n00:11:08.957 --> 00:11:13.250\nNow at any point in time,\nanybody could step into those roles.\n\n203\n00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:18.055\nSo somebody could step into your role if\nyou weren't able to attend a particular\n\n204\n00:11:18.055 --> 00:11:21.222\nepisode, then somebody\ncould step into your role.\n\n205\n00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:27.990\nSo you're the person, but the role that\nyou have is the role of host right now and\n\n206\n00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:32.653\nthe role that our director\nhas is the role of director.\n\n207\n00:11:32.653 --> 00:11:38.074\nAnd if at any point in time our director\ncan't fulfill those requirements,\n\n208\n00:11:38.074 --> 00:11:41.500\nthen another director will step in.\n\n209\n00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.019\nSo that's a wrong and\nthey're performing various activities.\n\n210\n00:11:45.019 --> 00:11:48.568\nSo the activities that you're\nperforming right now, well,\n\n211\n00:11:48.568 --> 00:11:52.290\nyour number one activity is to\npay attention can be difficult.\n\n212\n00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.038\nThis is Justin.\n\n213\n00:11:53.038 --> 00:11:57.735\n[LAUGH] But if we think about our\ndirector, their number one activity is to\n\n214\n00:11:57.735 --> 00:12:02.905\nmake sure that we have the right cameras\nand to make sure that they're focused.\n\n215\n00:12:02.905 --> 00:12:06.645\nAnd I'm probably gonna get this completely\nwrong and I'm gonna be told that no,\n\n216\n00:12:06.645 --> 00:12:08.523\nthat's not their number one activity.\n\n217\n00:12:08.523 --> 00:12:11.083\nBut that is the number one activity and\n\n218\n00:12:11.083 --> 00:12:16.892\nthey also have various other activities,\nand that is the, they are roles.\n\n219\n00:12:16.892 --> 00:12:22.440\nNow we talk about also, if we can\ntake a look at that particular slide.\n\n220\n00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.578\nAnd I wonder if we can put that up on\nfull screen, cuz my eye sight's not so\n\n221\n00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:26.356\ngreat right now.\n\n222\n00:12:27.466 --> 00:12:31.044\nSo in that bottom right hand corner\nthen in this particular screen,\n\n223\n00:12:31.044 --> 00:12:34.184\nyou'll see something that we\nhaven't talked about yet and\n\n224\n00:12:34.184 --> 00:12:37.162\nthat is structural elements and\nstructural elements.\n\n225\n00:12:37.162 --> 00:12:40.093\nWell, these are our governing elements.\n\n226\n00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:44.840\nSo things like our process forums and\nworking groups, and boards.\n\n227\n00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.892\nThese are the people that make decisions,\nbut they're groups of people.\n\n228\n00:12:48.892 --> 00:12:53.087\nSo these are outside of the roles and\noutside of the functionaries,\n\n229\n00:12:53.087 --> 00:12:55.990\ncuz they're generally cross-functional.\n\n230\n00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.650\nSo these are the people\nthat make the decisions.\n\n231\n00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.670\nSo for instance,\na working group for a process.\n\n232\n00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:06.406\nLet's say, we were talking about change\nmanagement and a working group for\n\n233\n00:13:06.406 --> 00:13:10.402\na process right now would be a group\nof people that get together.\n\n234\n00:13:10.402 --> 00:13:15.011\nAnd that group of people will make\ndecisions about what change management\n\n235\n00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:19.321\nshould look like or maybe how we can\nincrease our efficiency on change\n\n236\n00:13:19.321 --> 00:13:24.227\nmanagement and how we can get other\npeople involved in change management, and\n\n237\n00:13:24.227 --> 00:13:29.210\nhow we can evaluate change, and that\nwould be what we call a process forum.\n\n238\n00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.833\nSo that is almost a group of people.\n\n239\n00:13:32.833 --> 00:13:35.550\nI was just gonna say,\nalmost a working group there, but it is.\n\n240\n00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.325\nIt's a group of people that will get\ntogether and that will make decisions.\n\n241\n00:13:39.325 --> 00:13:40.580\nNow, a working group.\n\n242\n00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.013\nA group of people that will get\ntogether and come up with ideas.\n\n243\n00:13:44.013 --> 00:13:47.870\nSo let's just take a look at\nthese in a little bit more depth.\n\n244\n00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:52.021\nOver the next few slides, we're just gonna\nlook at the definitions of each of those\n\n245\n00:13:52.021 --> 00:13:54.948\nand just really go over what\nwe've already talked about.\n\n246\n00:13:54.948 --> 00:13:58.520\nSo you'll see in this particular slide,\na practice.\n\n247\n00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:04.310\nIt's the application or\nuse of an idea, belief or method.\n\n248\n00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.364\nIn other words,\nas I've already talked about.\n\n249\n00:14:06.364 --> 00:14:09.963\nWe talked about the ethical practices, for\n\n250\n00:14:09.963 --> 00:14:14.920\ninstance, whether we recycle or\nnot and then a process.\n\n251\n00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.480\nWell, it's a structured set of activities.\n\n252\n00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.960\nIt's a repeatable approach to\ncarry out a series of tasks.\n\n253\n00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.683\nSo and these are all familiar processes.\n\n254\n00:14:24.683 --> 00:14:28.923\nIf you have been in IT for long enough,\nyou'll have heard things like change\n\n255\n00:14:28.923 --> 00:14:32.990\nmanagement and incident management and\nproblem management.\n\n256\n00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:37.916\nThese are the same processes that\nwe look at at in IT, because and\n\n257\n00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:43.206\nI tell or as we look at processes\nfrom maybe an internal perspective,\n\n258\n00:14:43.206 --> 00:14:45.686\nan internal service provider.\n\n259\n00:14:45.686 --> 00:14:48.530\nHere is SIAM we're looking at processes.\n\n260\n00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.929\nWell, it still the same.\n\n261\n00:14:49.929 --> 00:14:53.411\nWe still need these processes\nto manage our services, but\n\n262\n00:14:53.411 --> 00:14:55.980\nwe're gonna look at this across vendors.\n\n263\n00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.892\nWe're gonna look at them\nacross our suppliers,\n\n264\n00:14:58.892 --> 00:15:01.244\nso it's multisourcing in processes.\n\n265\n00:15:01.244 --> 00:15:04.003\nSo the processes that\nwe have are processes,\n\n266\n00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:08.142\nsuch as business relationship management,\nfamiliar processes,\n\n267\n00:15:08.142 --> 00:15:12.145\nrelease management, event management,\ncatalog management.\n\n268\n00:15:12.145 --> 00:15:17.144\nThese are all familiar processes to you\nand we're gonna be looking at these\n\n269\n00:15:17.144 --> 00:15:21.050\nprocesses in a lot more depth\nin subsequent episodes.\n\n270\n00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:23.240\nSo be sure to catch those episodes,\n\n271\n00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.311\nif you want to know more\nabout a specific process.\n\n272\n00:15:26.311 --> 00:15:29.296\nJustin, you looked as though you\nwere about to ask a question.\n\n273\n00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:30.050\n&gt;&gt; I do have a question.\n\n274\n00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:34.227\nI noticed that these processes on\nthe previous side, it says, documented and\n\n275\n00:15:34.227 --> 00:15:38.359\nI've interfaced with various people\nwhere they're like we have a process.\n\n276\n00:15:38.359 --> 00:15:39.257\nBut it's not documented.\n\n277\n00:15:39.257 --> 00:15:44.009\nI'm guessing within SIAM, it is\nimperative to actually have documentation\n\n278\n00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:47.970\nabout respective processes,\nso that they're reproducable.\n\n279\n00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:53.019\nNow, anybody that has seen any\nof my other episodes will know\n\n280\n00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:57.683\nthat this is completely ad lib and\nI just wanna say this.\n\n281\n00:15:57.683 --> 00:16:02.256\nBecause it does sound as though, you have\nSet up, though I've set up that question,\n\n282\n00:16:02.256 --> 00:16:03.158\nand I haven't.\n\n283\n00:16:03.158 --> 00:16:04.512\nAnd the reason why is,\n\n284\n00:16:04.512 --> 00:16:09.436\nbecause [LAUGH] what you're talking about\nthere is the maturity of the processes.\n\n285\n00:16:09.436 --> 00:16:16.595\nAnd we have something called CMMI, which\nis Carnegie Mellon came up with a system,\n\n286\n00:16:16.595 --> 00:16:21.012\na method for\nmeasuring the maturity of processes.\n\n287\n00:16:21.012 --> 00:16:25.790\nAnd that methodology and that's something\nelse we look at in another series.\n\n288\n00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:32.850\nBut that methodology that allows us to\nevaluate a process based on certain\n\n289\n00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:38.070\ncriteria, and one of those criteria\nsimply well, is it an ad hoc process?\n\n290\n00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.040\nDoes it actually exist?\n\n291\n00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.800\nHas anybody even thought\nabout that process?\n\n292\n00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.500\nIs it an ad hoc process?\n\n293\n00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.570\nIs it a process that's been documented, is\nit a process that is routinely followed?\n\n294\n00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.270\nIs it a process that's\nsubject to improvement?\n\n295\n00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.390\nIn other words,\nis it evaluated on a regular basis?\n\n296\n00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.160\nSo, yeah, there is a huge,\n\n297\n00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.540\nbig difference between just saying\nthat we've got a process, and\n\n298\n00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:04.890\nactually having it documented, then\nfollowing it, and then evaluate it and\n\n299\n00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.870\nauditing that process on a regular basis.\n&gt;&gt; And that would be one of\n\n300\n00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:13.070\nthe process form's responsibilities, or\nwould that also be some of those other\n\n301\n00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:16.540\ngroup's responsibilities as\nwell to evaluate the process.\n\n302\n00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.370\nAnd I'm focusing on processes,\n\n303\n00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:22.040\nbecause of some biased interests,\njust to be transparent.\n\n304\n00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.170\nBut would it be their responsibility to\ndo those evaluations, documentation and\n\n305\n00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.160\nthings like that?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n306\n00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.690\nOkay, so let me just take a look at it.\n\n307\n00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.460\nIf we can put that screen\nback up onto the third there.\n\n308\n00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.330\nSo, halfway down in that\nfirst column that we've got,\n\n309\n00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.130\nyou'll see something called\ncontinual improvement.\n\n310\n00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:41.117\nContinual improvement is\na process in it's own right, and\n\n311\n00:17:41.117 --> 00:17:46.395\nthat all of these are the responsibility\nof the service integrator to manage.\n\n312\n00:17:46.395 --> 00:17:51.880\nAnd they have to manage these across\nall of our service providers.\n\n313\n00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:57.220\nBut there is a specific process that\ncomes with its own set of activities and\n\n314\n00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.130\nthat process' continual improvement.\n\n315\n00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:03.120\nAnd that process is accountable for\n\n316\n00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:08.080\nensuring that all of the other process\nare evaluated on a regular basis.\n\n317\n00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:13.070\nSo, even though we put this firmly and\n\n318\n00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:16.975\nsquarely in the realm of\nthe service integrator.\n\n319\n00:18:16.975 --> 00:18:20.550\nNevertheless, we actually\nhave a defined process for\n\n320\n00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.610\nperforming continual improvement.\n\n321\n00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.420\nSo, for making sure that if we were to\nuse the CMMI scale, and by all means,\n\n322\n00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.610\nGoogle it, or\ntake a look at our series on CMMI.\n\n323\n00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.810\nBut if we were to use the CMMI scale.\n\n324\n00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:38.696\nThen continual improvement ensures that\nwe move through that scale from a zero\n\n325\n00:18:38.696 --> 00:18:44.092\nwhere a process is non existent right\nthe way to a five where it's implemented,\n\n326\n00:18:44.092 --> 00:18:48.061\nit's followed all the time on\na regular basis every time.\n\n327\n00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:50.710\nAnd that it is actually\nsubject to improvement.\n\n328\n00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:54.060\nSo, yes, we've got somebody\nthat takes ownership for that.\n\n329\n00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.440\nSo, let's move on then to our functions.\n\n330\n00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.620\nNow, I've all ready said that\nfunctions were a group of people.\n\n331\n00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:07.390\nWell, we might call them an organizational\nentity, and they have for\n\n332\n00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:11.110\nthat particular entity they\nhave a specialist knowledge.\n\n333\n00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:14.240\nNow, I know that we have a laugh\nabout the English language.\n\n334\n00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.620\nAnd so, I'll use the word specialism,\n\n335\n00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.901\nyou use the word specialization,\nbut we're okay with that [LAUGH].\n\n336\n00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:26.250\nA function is a group of\npeople in their specialism.\n\n337\n00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:30.110\nAnd it's the tools that they use as\nwell to help facilitate their role,\n\n338\n00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.010\nwhatever their role may be.\n\n339\n00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:36.170\nSo, a service desk is a good\nexample of a functional area.\n\n340\n00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:37.380\nSo, they have a specialism.\n\n341\n00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:43.240\nDo you know what their specialism is?\n&gt;&gt; Providing service to,\n\n342\n00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.570\nI don't know!, [LAUGH].\n\n343\n00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:48.060\nJo, I'm telling you,\nyou keep throwing me under the bus here.\n\n344\n00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.120\nWhen I think of someone specialist,\nthey tend to be, for a service desk,\n\n345\n00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:56.460\nI think of them being as like a generalist\nthat have access for acquiring information\n\n346\n00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:01.990\nto solve my problem quickly.\n&gt;&gt; Right, the specialism of a service desk\n\n347\n00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:05.400\nis to be the single point of contact for\nthe customer.\n\n348\n00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.540\nNow, what you were thinking of, and\nthe reason why I ask the question,\n\n349\n00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.020\nis not to throw you under the bus.\n\n350\n00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.260\nBut it's simply, because this is\nthe question that's asked of me the most\n\n351\n00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:18.130\noften, really,\nabout things like service desk.\n\n352\n00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:23.250\nWhat I get in when I speak to people,\nand when I do consultancy, or training,\n\n353\n00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:28.030\nor speaking the quite often I have a lot\nof technical people in front of me,\n\n354\n00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.140\nand they're thinking about\nmanaging their IT services.\n\n355\n00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.930\nAnd they automatically tend\nto think in a technical way.\n\n356\n00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:37.010\nAnd that's exactly what you've just done.\n\n357\n00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.690\nAnd that's exactly the reason\nwhy I asked the question.\n\n358\n00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:44.670\nYou see, the service desk is going to\nbe as technical as you need it to be,\n\n359\n00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.960\nbut there are varying\ntypes of service desks.\n\n360\n00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.390\nAnd some service desks are what we call,\nsort of, unskilled service desks.\n\n361\n00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:56.450\nAnd these are service desks that\nare simply filtering calls.\n\n362\n00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:01.490\nSo, when you get a high volume of calls,\nand you have a diverse range of services,\n\n363\n00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.490\nthen your service desk will\nbe what you call, unskilled.\n\n364\n00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.160\nOn skill dowsing, or technical skills.\n\n365\n00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.310\nWhereas if it's a specialist serviced\nthere, dealing with one particular\n\n366\n00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:16.100\napplication only, then that will\nbe a highly skilled service desk.\n\n367\n00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:20.610\nSo, it will be a service desk made\nup of incredibly technical people.\n\n368\n00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.970\nNow, obviously that comes with\nit's own challenges as well.\n\n369\n00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:26.940\nBecause invariably incredibly technical\npeople are not necessarily the best at\n\n370\n00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.299\nthe customer facing roles.\n\n371\n00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.120\nSo, we have to ensure\nthat the service desk\n\n372\n00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.630\nhas got skills that\nare predominantly interpersonal.\n\n373\n00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.350\nThey're the most important,\nwe can train technical skills, but\n\n374\n00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.250\nyou can't train someone to be patient.\n\n375\n00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:49.470\nSo, this is why we talk about service desk\nskills, and service desk itself as being\n\n376\n00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:54.450\na specialism, because service desk\nskills are incredibly valuable.\n\n377\n00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:59.490\nWe cannot always assume our\nservice desk is going to be,\n\n378\n00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:01.150\nwell, a technical service desk.\n\n379\n00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:06.764\nSo, I also have, and\nwe've already looked at roles, and\n\n380\n00:22:06.764 --> 00:22:12.023\nwe've got in this particular slide\nin front of you now, we've just got\n\n381\n00:22:12.023 --> 00:22:17.653\nan example there of what we need to\nensure when we actually implement roles.\n\n382\n00:22:17.653 --> 00:22:23.810\nWe need to ensure that we understand what\nlayer that particular role refers to.\n\n383\n00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.200\nSo, is it a role within\nthe service integrator layer, or\n\n384\n00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.190\nis it a role within each\nindividual service provider?\n\n385\n00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.400\nAnd also, how are they gonna be organized?\n\n386\n00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.400\nWhat function are they going to sit in?\n\n387\n00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.920\nWhat function does this role belong to?\n\n388\n00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.380\nAnd then,\nthink also about our structural elements.\n\n389\n00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:43.160\nAre they part of, you know, a group,\n\n390\n00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:48.430\na group of people, so we can find roles\nin each of these, we can find roles\n\n391\n00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:53.020\nin our organization in our layer, we have\nprocess roles, we have functional roles.\n\n392\n00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:58.930\nAnd so, in terms of implementing SIAM,\nif we're implementing\n\n393\n00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:03.930\nthe SIAM methodology,\nthen think about the strategy.\n\n394\n00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:08.550\nWhat kind of roles and responsibilities\nwould we need for the strategy, and\n\n395\n00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:13.520\nwhat roles and responsibilities would we\nneed for planning, and for implementation,\n\n396\n00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.430\nand for actually improving SIAM.\n\n397\n00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:21.750\nAnd what you've got here are just examples\nof what we may need in terms of roles.\n\n398\n00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.290\nSo, what sort of people do we need?\n\n399\n00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.206\nWhat sort of skills do they need?\n\n400\n00:23:25.206 --> 00:23:28.918\nAnd then, our last composition, or\n\n401\n00:23:28.918 --> 00:23:34.800\nour last component, sorry,\nI should say, of SIAM.\n\n402\n00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.620\nIs our structural element.\n\n403\n00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.650\nAnd our structural element,\nwe've already looked at these.\n\n404\n00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:42.580\nThese are organizational entities.\n\n405\n00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.480\nSo, these are our working groups.\n\n406\n00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.460\nThese are our governing bodies.\n\n407\n00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.370\nThese are the people\nthat make the decisions.\n\n408\n00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:53.180\nAnd so, our structural entities\nare things like our process forums, and\n\n409\n00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.920\nour boards, and our working groups.\n\n410\n00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:02.660\nAnd if you were to download the slide pack\nthat comes with this particular episode,\n\n411\n00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.470\nthen you will see we also got examples for\nthe roles, and\n\n412\n00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:10.910\nresponsibilities for\nall of our working groups as well.\n\n413\n00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:16.110\nSo, all in all these particular\nstructural elements, well,\n\n414\n00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:21.380\nthey help with the practices, and\nthe process, and the functional areas.\n\n415\n00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.600\nThey help make up the composition of SIAM.\n\n416\n00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:29.540\nThese are all the things that we need\nto ensure that our service integrate\n\n417\n00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:34.970\nlayer delivers value to our end customer.\n\n418\n00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:39.840\nAnd when we come back in our next episode,\nwhat we're going to\n\n419\n00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.650\ndo is we're gonna explore one of\nthese practices in more depth.\n\n420\n00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:47.500\nAnd we're actually going to explore\nthe practice of process forums.\n\n421\n00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.370\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much,\n\n422\n00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:52.930\nJo, I can see the validity\nof having all of this\n\n423\n00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:57.940\nvery structured ideas around\nimplementing your business organization.\n\n424\n00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.660\nSo, thank you so much and hopefully,\n\n425\n00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.750\nyou will join us back as\nwe get deeper into SIAM.\n\n426\n00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:04.580\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n427\n00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.910\nSo, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host,\n\n428\n00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:08.810\nJustin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n429\n00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:10.929\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.299\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:13.170\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.470\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.940\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and we're\ncontinuing on with our SIAM foundation.\n\n7\n00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.000\nI will tell you what, not putting\nthe S on that is difficult for me.\n\n8\n00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.040\nI don't know why.\n\n9\n00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.770\nBut today we're going to be\ntalking about process forms.\n\n10\n00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.270\nAnd here to help us along in that\nendeavor is Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.680\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; I'm absolutely fine, thank you Justin.\n\n12\n00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.460\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.130\nBut before I ask that,\n\n14\n00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.500\nI suspect it's just the English\nthat you've got difficulty with.\n\n15\n00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.860\nIt's not just us, right.\n\n16\n00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.241\nIt's the language.\n&gt;&gt; You may have a valid point there, Jo.\n\n17\n00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:46.180\nI am doing well.\n\n18\n00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.380\nAnd in the previous episode we kinda\ngave an overview of these process forms.\n\n19\n00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.490\nSo we're gonna take\na little bit deeper dive.\n\n20\n00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.730\nRight, and I will try to keep\nmy English under control,\n\n21\n00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.140\nbut where do we need to get started here?\n&gt;&gt; Look,\n\n22\n00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.270\nI don't need you to keep\nyour English under control.\n\n23\n00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.850\nActually, I quite like the accent,\nI just wanted to say that.\n\n24\n00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.160\nI really do.\n\n25\n00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.720\nBut in turn, you need to like mine.\n&gt;&gt; I do enjoy yours.\n\n26\n00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay, then we're all right.\n\n27\n00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.740\nThat's good.\n\n28\n00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.430\nSo today what we're gonna do,\nwe're in a part two actually.\n\n29\n00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.660\nIf you remember in our previous episode we\nwere looking at the structural elements\n\n30\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.730\nof SIAM.\n\n31\n00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.910\nAnd what I'm gonna do is just a second,\n\n32\n00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.890\nhere we go, I'm going to we'll\nbring up our structural elements.\n\n33\n00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.220\nAnd the structural elements,\n\n34\n00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.170\nyou also refer to them as the composition\nof SIAM, what makes up SIAM.\n\n35\n00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.910\nAnd these were our practices and our\nprocesses and our functions and our roles\n\n36\n00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.290\nand our structural elements, and we had\nthree different structural elements.\n\n37\n00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.660\nAnd in this particular episode,\n\n38\n00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.530\nwe're going to focus on with\nthose three structural elements.\n\n39\n00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.190\nAnd these are the structural elements,\n\n40\n00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.370\nso boards, process forums,\nand working groups.\n\n41\n00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.420\nAnd we're actually going to look at\nthe difference between all of them.\n\n42\n00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.455\nAnd so, I have another slide here that\nwe're just gonna bring up right now, and\n\n43\n00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:06.483\nI'm wonder if we can go full\nscreen on that one for a second.\n\n44\n00:02:06.483 --> 00:02:09.390\nSee, we've got some wonderful\ndirectors here haven't we Justin?\n\n45\n00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.700\n&gt;&gt; We do, the utmost professional.\n\n46\n00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.180\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, they're always,\n\n47\n00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.050\nthey're just so in tune with us.\n\n48\n00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.540\nI'm always impressed.\n\n49\n00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.650\nSo we've got three structure\nelements here then.\n\n50\n00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.570\nWe have our boards.\n\n51\n00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.350\nNow these boards,\nno it's not just a plank of wood.\n\n52\n00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.390\nI know I've heard some things\nsaid about boards in my past.\n\n53\n00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.570\nBut the boards are decision making groups.\n\n54\n00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.042\nSo our boards are people\nlike our steering group for\n\n55\n00:02:34.042 --> 00:02:37.119\ninstance that make\ndecisions on our behalf.\n\n56\n00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:40.139\nAnd when I say ours, I mean IT.\n\n57\n00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:45.520\nI mean the service integrator,\nI mean on behalf of the customer.\n\n58\n00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.350\nSo we have boards within our\nSIAM ecosystem as we call it or\n\n59\n00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.820\nhow do we call it here?\n\n60\n00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.560\nAn ecosystem?\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna stay away from eco.\n\n61\n00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I am all right with that too.\n\n62\n00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.290\nSo our boards are people\nthat make the decision,\n\n63\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.730\nso things like the steering group for\ninstance.\n\n64\n00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.950\nGovernance boards, anybody that makes\na decision on behalf of a organization.\n\n65\n00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.300\nSo for instance,\nwe've mentioned the steering group.\n\n66\n00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.570\nWe've also got, I would expect us to have\na main board within our organization\n\n67\n00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.010\nthat makes strategic decisions on\nbehalf of the organization in total.\n\n68\n00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:31.040\nWe've got a steaming group within IT,\nor within the service provider.\n\n69\n00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.240\nAnd I'm expecting to see\nsteering groups there, and\n\n70\n00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.360\nthey're gonna make strategic decisions.\n\n71\n00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.460\nAnd then, we may also have\n\n72\n00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.480\na very small board that makes decisions on\nbehalf of the service integrator as well.\n\n73\n00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.720\nNow if we remember our layers, and we\ntalked about these in a previous episode.\n\n74\n00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.420\nWe had our customer layer,\nwe had our service integrator layer, and\n\n75\n00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.150\nthen we had our service providers.\n\n76\n00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.840\nAnd our service providers\nwere from multiple sources,\n\n77\n00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.360\nwhether they be internal,\nwhether they be external.\n\n78\n00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.040\nAnd also these providers came\nwith their own challenges.\n\n79\n00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.900\nAnd we're gonna look at these in\na lot more depth in future episodes.\n\n80\n00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.800\nBut also these providers came with\nthe challenges that they have their own\n\n81\n00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.990\nethics and their own organization\nthat they work within.\n\n82\n00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.510\nAnd that means that they've\ngot their own way of working,\n\n83\n00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.140\nthey've got their own governance\nstructure within that organization.\n\n84\n00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.410\nSo here we are then.\n\n85\n00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.620\nAs a customer and as a service\nintegrator in that SIAM ecosystem, and\n\n86\n00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.590\nwhat we're trying to do is we're trying\nto get all of our service providers\n\n87\n00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:46.410\nto work in a way that aligns itself\nto our way of working as a customer.\n\n88\n00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.960\nNow this is interesting because remember\nin a previous episode we talked\n\n89\n00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.620\nabout recycling, and\nwhen we talked about recycling,\n\n90\n00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.810\nI mentioned in our previous episode\nthat some countries in the world have\n\n91\n00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.550\nmandatory recycling for\nhardware and some countries don't.\n\n92\n00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.140\nSo let's say then that our client,\nour customer, well let's say\n\n93\n00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.830\nthat they're based in Europe, or rather\ntheir head office is based in Europe.\n\n94\n00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.240\nAnd because they operate in Europe,\nand in Canada,\n\n95\n00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.240\nthen they have mandatory recycling.\n\n96\n00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.710\nAnd so what they have decided\nto do is they have decided to\n\n97\n00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.020\nimplement an ethical rule,\nan ethical sort of governance\n\n98\n00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.510\nstrategy that says that they're\ngonna recycle [COUGH] excuse me,\n\n99\n00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.440\nthey're gonna recycle, ride the way,\nacross the organization.\n\n100\n00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.180\nThat's fine.\nFor that customer organization,\n\n101\n00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.720\nthat's fine.\n\n102\n00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.630\nThat means that we see the bins or trash\ncans or whatever you want to call them,\n\n103\n00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:49.310\nthe recycling bins, around the offices for\npeople to put paper and cans, etc, in.\n\n104\n00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.120\nBut what it also means is\nthat our computer equipment\n\n105\n00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.870\nhas to be recycled as well.\n\n106\n00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.640\nSounds simple enough until you\nrealize that we've got four or\n\n107\n00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.090\nfive perhaps different service providers.\n\n108\n00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.060\nAnd maybe one of those\nservice providers is\n\n109\n00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.810\nthe hardware manufacturer\nthat doesn't recycle.\n\n110\n00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.710\nAnd I'm gonna use some examples here, and\n\n111\n00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.660\nthese are just examples by the way no way\naffiliated with the companies at all.\n\n112\n00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.100\nBut let's say we've got a hardware\nmanufacturer such as Dell, and\n\n113\n00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.410\nwe're using also HP, and\nmaybe we're using Lenovo as well.\n\n114\n00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.210\nAnd one of those doesn't\nhave a recycling policy.\n\n115\n00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:32.090\nSo the service integrator, that middle\nlayer, the layer that translates,\n\n116\n00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.360\nhas then got to take the policy\nfrom the customer board.\n\n117\n00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.390\nThat policy, and its got to then\nsay to the service providers, okay,\n\n118\n00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:47.590\nI know that only one of you or\nmaybe two of you actually recycle.\n\n119\n00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.240\nHowever, we have got to demonstrate\nthat we recycle all of our hardware.\n\n120\n00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.920\nSo when you decommission a new laptop or\na server or maybe some disk storage.\n\n121\n00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.830\nWhen you decommission that, we want to see\nevidence that, that has been recycled.\n\n122\n00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.980\nWe don't wanna see evidence\nthat it's been destroyed,\n\n123\n00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.120\nwe wanna see evidence\nthat it's been recycled.\n\n124\n00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:14.305\nSo I'm gonna ask you a question, Justin,\ncuz I know you've been paying attention.\n\n125\n00:07:14.305 --> 00:07:18.993\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've been trying [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH].\n\n126\n00:07:18.993 --> 00:07:23.427\n&gt;&gt; So whose ethics then do you think\n\n127\n00:07:23.427 --> 00:07:26.980\noverride the other?\n\n128\n00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.430\nBecause if we've got a service provider\nthat doesn't want to recycle and\n\n129\n00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:36.440\nthat's never recycled, but then we've\ngot the customer that has imposed\n\n130\n00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.450\nan ethic within the organization\nthat we must recycle, then\n\n131\n00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:47.633\nwhich one trumps the other?\n&gt;&gt; I would anticipate that, within reason,\n\n132\n00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:52.287\nthat the customer's ethics override\nbecause you're providing a service.\n\n133\n00:07:52.287 --> 00:07:56.760\nThen you should try to meet at least\nsome kind of compromise position\n\n134\n00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.243\nbecause you are, in fact,\na service provider to that individual.\n\n135\n00:08:01.243 --> 00:08:03.970\nAnd I'm guessing I'm on the right base cuz\n\n136\n00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.974\nyou're not giving me the-\n&gt;&gt; I'm not giving you the evil\n\n137\n00:08:06.974 --> 00:08:07.683\neye, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n138\n00:08:07.683 --> 00:08:09.700\n&gt;&gt; No, you're on the right way.\n\n139\n00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.610\nBear it in mind that the customer\norganization is the customer.\n\n140\n00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.810\nAnd so a customer gets what they pay for.\n\n141\n00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:21.170\nAnd if they're paying for something to\nbe recycled, it's part of their ethical\n\n142\n00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.480\ngovernance, then in that case,\nthen yeah, you're right.\n\n143\n00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.220\nWhat they get or\nwhat they want is what they should get.\n\n144\n00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:32.850\nNow, I know that there are going to be,\nand we use recycling as an example here,\n\n145\n00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:37.710\nand I know that there are going to\nbe a couple of elements that may be\n\n146\n00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.250\ndifficult for certain service providers.\n\n147\n00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.860\nAnd it's down then to the customer,\nnot the service integrator.\n\n148\n00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.980\nIt's down to the customer because\nthey are paying the bills.\n\n149\n00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.460\nAs to what compromises\nthey want to reach and\n\n150\n00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.710\nwhat compromises they want to agree to.\n\n151\n00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.310\nNow, I expect the service integrator\nto be doing the negotiation.\n\n152\n00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.260\nWhat's really important is that,\nfrom a service integrative perspective,\n\n153\n00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.990\nis that everybody's\nworking in the same way.\n\n154\n00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.460\nSo all of our service providers\nshould be working in the same way.\n\n155\n00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:18.040\nSo we should all be working to\nthe same degree of conformity.\n\n156\n00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.560\nAnd that's important because\nthe customer shouldn't see\n\n157\n00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.500\nany difference in service at all.\n\n158\n00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.830\nWhichever service provider is being used\nshould be invisible to the customer.\n\n159\n00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.250\nThey don't need to know this,\n\n160\n00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:36.030\nwhich is why the service integrator\nhas that the incredibly difficult\n\n161\n00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.760\njob because their role is to make sure\nthat all of the service providers,\n\n162\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.660\nwhether they're internal or external,\nare working in the same way.\n\n163\n00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.480\nSo then we have a different type\nof structural element then.\n\n164\n00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.280\nSo we've look at our boards, and\nnow we're going to look at process forums.\n\n165\n00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.240\nAnd we're also gonna look at\nworking groups in a moment.\n\n166\n00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:02.340\nSo process forums work on proactive\ndevelopment, innovation and improvements.\n\n167\n00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:09.550\nSo a process forum, I expect to be fairly,\nwell, planned, not so much ad hoc.\n\n168\n00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.470\nSo if we take a look at what\na process forum should do.\n\n169\n00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.100\nThey look at development.\n\n170\n00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.840\nThey look at implementing\nnew working practices.\n\n171\n00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.880\nThey look at process improvement.\n\n172\n00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.440\nThey're also looking\nat innovation as well.\n\n173\n00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.070\nThey're looking at\ndeveloping data standards.\n\n174\n00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.840\nNow all of this is one word that Justin\nused in a previous episode actually, and\n\n175\n00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.430\nthat's proactive.\n\n176\n00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.330\nSo what a process forum should do,\n\n177\n00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.535\nis a process forum should\nmeet on a regular basis.\n\n178\n00:10:41.535 --> 00:10:46.290\nCould be ad hoc, but it's more than\nlikely going to be a regular basis.\n\n179\n00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.000\nAnd Justin asked a question\nin a previous episode\n\n180\n00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.210\nabout who should be responsible for this.\n\n181\n00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:56.260\nAnd, of course CSI, Continual Service\nImprovement, should be responsible for\n\n182\n00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.080\nensuring that we do have\nprocess improvement.\n\n183\n00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.505\nAnd that improvement\nhappens on a regular basis.\n\n184\n00:11:03.505 --> 00:11:07.650\nThat we are, in a continual way,\n\n185\n00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.660\nchecking that we are aligned to\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n186\n00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.020\nIn other words, the needs of the customer.\n\n187\n00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.840\nSo on a continual basis, then\n\n188\n00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:22.150\nwe should be ensuring that, and I say\nwe but I mean the service integrator,\n\n189\n00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:27.190\nshould be ensuring that we're aligned to\nwhatever the direction is of the business.\n\n190\n00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.680\nNow, we know,\nwe've explored this in previous episodes,\n\n191\n00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.660\nthat business strategies change.\n\n192\n00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:36.090\nAnd when business strategies change,\nwe have to react to that.\n\n193\n00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:41.900\nAnd it's the role of CSI to ensure that we\nremained aligned to their changing needs.\n\n194\n00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.430\nSo I'm gonna bring in a question, and this\nis another tricky question for Justin.\n\n195\n00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:48.910\nAnd I ask this question\nof quite a lot of people.\n\n196\n00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.100\nAnd quite a lot people\ndon't know the difference,\n\n197\n00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.490\nso I'm not gonna judge you,\nnot in this time.\n\n198\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.110\nBut do you know the difference\nbetween continual and continuous?\n\n199\n00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.700\n&gt;&gt; Continuous is, that one gets tricky.\n\n200\n00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.125\nContinual means on an ongoing basis.\n\n201\n00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:12.870\nContinuous is like all the time,\nevery time, or do I have those backwards?\n\n202\n00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:16.880\nYou say you're not judging me, but\nit kind of feels like you're judging me.\n\n203\n00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.850\n&gt;&gt; No I'm not judging, honest,\n\n204\n00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:19.520\nI promise I'm not judging you.\n\n205\n00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.340\nThis is the question that\nI ask people all the time,\n\n206\n00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.420\nbecause I hear people referring\nto continuous improvement or\n\n207\n00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:31.010\ncontinuous service improvement and\nit makes me cringe a little bit inside.\n\n208\n00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.870\nAnd I'll tell you why.\n\n209\n00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:37.515\nContinuous means ongoing, neverending,\nongoing, that's continuous.\n\n210\n00:12:37.515 --> 00:12:42.100\nWhereas continual is iterative,\nit is repeatable.\n\n211\n00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:47.880\nSo we do it once, we stop,\nwe do it again, we stop, we do it again.\n\n212\n00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.992\nBoth of them will get us to\nthe same destination, but\n\n213\n00:12:51.992 --> 00:12:55.357\none of them is more of\na controlled method.\n\n214\n00:12:55.357 --> 00:12:57.506\nLet me give you an example.\n\n215\n00:12:57.506 --> 00:13:03.579\nThe real example I always use is the\ndifference between driving and walking.\n\n216\n00:13:03.579 --> 00:13:06.196\nDriving is a continuous method.\n\n217\n00:13:06.196 --> 00:13:10.010\nYour wheels are continuously turning.\n\n218\n00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:11.190\nAll the time they're turning.\n\n219\n00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:16.140\nNow it's gonna get us to our destination,\nno problem at all.\n\n220\n00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:21.320\nBut it doesn't allow for very accurate\nmeasurement of our improvement,\n\n221\n00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.220\nbecause by the time you've looked\nat that sat nav or that GPS and\n\n222\n00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.740\nyou've worked out, you've looked at it and\nit's told where you are.\n\n223\n00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.340\nWell, actually it depends on how fast\nyou're driving as to how accurate it is,\n\n224\n00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.608\ncuz it's gotta get a signal\nback down from the satellite.\n\n225\n00:13:35.608 --> 00:13:38.060\nAnd if you drive like\nme at 100 mile an hour,\n\n226\n00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.950\nI hope there's no police watching.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n227\n00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:41.560\n&gt;&gt; If you're driving like me then\n\n228\n00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.310\nit's gonna be incredibly accurate.\n\n229\n00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:47.240\nAnd how many times have you gone past that\njunction that you needed to turn down?\n\n230\n00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.270\nIt happens a lot.\n\n231\n00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:54.121\nAnd if you wanna change direction,\nyou've generally got to, well,\n\n232\n00:13:54.121 --> 00:13:58.560\nyou've got a lot of work to be doing this\nwhen you shouldn't be doing that because\n\n233\n00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.632\nyou're driving or you've gotta pull\nover and it is going to cause delay.\n\n234\n00:14:02.632 --> 00:14:09.710\nAnd then there's walking, walking,\nor running, is a continual method.\n\n235\n00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:13.762\nAnd it's iterative,\nit's repeatable step by step by step.\n\n236\n00:14:13.762 --> 00:14:16.704\nYou're still gonna get to\nthe same direction, and\n\n237\n00:14:16.704 --> 00:14:19.654\nI mentioned running because\nspeed is not an issue.\n\n238\n00:14:19.654 --> 00:14:24.790\nBut you're still gonna get\nthere with every single step.\n\n239\n00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.520\nBut with every single step,\nyou have an exact point in time and\n\n240\n00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.860\nan exact measurement.\n\n241\n00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.077\nSo you know exactly how\nfar you've gone and\n\n242\n00:14:32.077 --> 00:14:34.630\nyou know exactly how far you've got to go.\n\n243\n00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:35.550\nAnd guess what?\n\n244\n00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:41.190\nIf you wanna change direction,\nyou do so with the next step.\n\n245\n00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:46.570\nSo continual improvement is about\nmeasured iterative improvement.\n\n246\n00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:50.090\nStill improving, but doing so\nin a controlled manner.\n\n247\n00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:55.310\nAnd no, it shouldn't be any\nslower than continuous.\n\n248\n00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.400\nWhat it should be though\nis more controlled.\n\n249\n00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.920\nSo that's why we talk about\ncontinual improvement, and\n\n250\n00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.290\nthis is why it lends itself\nto our process forums.\n\n251\n00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:08.370\nCuz our process forums, if they're\non a regular basis, then we will\n\n252\n00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:12.550\nregularly be checking our alignment\nagainst the needs of the organization.\n\n253\n00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.178\nYou look as though you're thinking Justin,\nthat scares me.\n\n254\n00:15:17.178 --> 00:15:20.410\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking, and this makes sense.\n\n255\n00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:25.970\nSo the ultimate goal for\ncontinual is to have some kind of discreet\n\n256\n00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:30.979\ncheckpoints where I can evaluate my\nprogress based on some sort of metrics,\n\n257\n00:15:30.979 --> 00:15:33.040\nwhatever those metrics may be.\n\n258\n00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.598\nAnd then make a decision\nto either go left, right,\n\n259\n00:15:35.598 --> 00:15:36.958\nwhatever it may be.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n260\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.103\n&gt;&gt; With the ultimate goal of going I\n\n261\n00:15:39.103 --> 00:15:42.310\nmay have a moving point of destination.\n\n262\n00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.970\nSlightly moving, not drastically moving.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n263\n00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.694\n&gt;&gt; Whereas continuous is, well, if I'm\n\n264\n00:15:47.694 --> 00:15:53.471\ndriving, I'm trying to get there, I'm not\nreally evaluating so much at discreet\n\n265\n00:15:53.471 --> 00:15:58.936\npoints in time to be able to make the\ndecisions necessary to change direction.\n\n266\n00:15:58.936 --> 00:16:04.797\nOr I don't have this much I don't\nhave as much reflection about how to\n\n267\n00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:09.509\nchange those directions necessary, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n268\n00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:12.975\nso, and it's funny that you\nmentioned that sort of,\n\n269\n00:16:12.975 --> 00:16:18.443\nI'm not too sure how far I've got to go,\nor I don't have the time when I'm driving,\n\n270\n00:16:18.443 --> 00:16:21.469\nI don't have the to\nmeasure how far I've got.\n\n271\n00:16:21.469 --> 00:16:22.910\nWe generally don't.\n\n272\n00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:26.722\nWe save it until we're right at the very\nend before to measure how far we've gone,\n\n273\n00:16:26.722 --> 00:16:30.424\nand it's only when somebody calls you\nup when you're driving, and by the way,\n\n274\n00:16:30.424 --> 00:16:33.602\nif you're in England,\nno somebody shouldn't be calling you out.\n\n275\n00:16:33.602 --> 00:16:37.340\nIt's the same around here as well,\nbut anyway [LAUGH].\n\n276\n00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:42.240\nWhen you're driving, yeah, if somebody\nsays to you how far have you got,\n\n277\n00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:49.060\nbecause I think so, or I think I'm here\nis not a good enough justification for\n\n278\n00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:55.540\nmaking improvements, or for giving\nan exact location at that point in time.\n\n279\n00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:00.140\nI think I'm here is not exact, or\nhave you made an improvement, well,\n\n280\n00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:05.040\nI think I have is not exact, and\nthis is why finally enough, and\n\n281\n00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.150\nit's, you mentioned this, and it made\nme chuckle to myself because the next\n\n282\n00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:13.960\nslide that I've got in front of you\nis a slide that refers to KPI's, and\n\n283\n00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.500\nhere is an example of\nthe difference between,\n\n284\n00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.150\nwell the integration for\nchange management and problem and\n\n285\n00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:25.570\nrelease management from the service\nintegrator to the service providers.\n\n286\n00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:30.240\nThese KPI's, these key performance\nindicators, the key performance\n\n287\n00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.230\nindicators will tell us how far we\nare getting with our improvements.\n\n288\n00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:39.500\nBut they will also tell us how we are\nperforming and that's, clues in the title\n\n289\n00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:44.510\nthere, keep performance indicators, and\nso they will tell us whether a process\n\n290\n00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:48.270\nis due and what they should do, or whether\na process is not doing what it should do,\n\n291\n00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:52.360\nand it needs improvement, and\nthere are two real types of improvement.\n\n292\n00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:57.275\nOne is because we're not doing too well,\nand therefore, we ned to do better, or\n\n293\n00:17:57.275 --> 00:18:01.689\nthe second has because life is changed and\nsomething in the organization\n\n294\n00:18:01.689 --> 00:18:05.767\nhas moved on, and then we've got\nto realign ourselves with that.\n\n295\n00:18:05.767 --> 00:18:10.846\nSo, as I would say, because I think so\nit's not a good measurement to say\n\n296\n00:18:10.846 --> 00:18:16.010\nthat you have improved, and I wanna go\nback slightly here and look at other\n\n297\n00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:21.448\nthings that the process forums discuss,\nsuch as common working practices.\n\n298\n00:18:21.448 --> 00:18:25.825\nAgain, I like to put that under\nthe banner of improvement as well,\n\n299\n00:18:25.825 --> 00:18:31.455\nbecause if we're working in a common way\nor a standard way then that's consistency,\n\n300\n00:18:31.455 --> 00:18:34.600\nand that's going to\nimprove your efficiency.\n\n301\n00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.501\nBut also things like data standards,\nand again,\n\n302\n00:18:38.501 --> 00:18:41.945\nwe've got back consistency\ntherefore we've got efficiency.\n\n303\n00:18:41.945 --> 00:18:48.580\nThe process forum should help to look for\nconsistency in our data standards.\n\n304\n00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:53.390\nOur data storage for instance, things\nlike, how often do we take a backup,\n\n305\n00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.500\nis it a full backup,\nis it an incremental backup?\n\n306\n00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.125\nWhere do we store our data?\n\n307\n00:18:58.125 --> 00:18:59.580\nDo we store it offsite?\n\n308\n00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:03.048\nI should hope so if it's a backup,\nplease tell me that you do,\n\n309\n00:19:03.048 --> 00:19:04.796\n[LAUGH] or do we store it onsite?\n\n310\n00:19:04.796 --> 00:19:06.782\nWhat about our databases?\n\n311\n00:19:06.782 --> 00:19:11.061\nHow often is our DBA gonna go in there and\nclean up the data?\n\n312\n00:19:11.061 --> 00:19:13.000\nWhen do we archive data?\n\n313\n00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.050\nHow long do we keep it full?\n\n314\n00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:20.300\nAll of these data standards need to be\napplied consistally across the board.\n\n315\n00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:25.210\nBut we know that there are different\nrequirements for data, and security will\n\n316\n00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:29.640\nhave a huge big impact in this, but\nalso we've got legislation as well.\n\n317\n00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:34.210\nWe want to ensure the consistency of our\ndata, we want to ensure the integrity of\n\n318\n00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.230\nour data, but we've also got to\nthink about legislation, and\n\n319\n00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:42.340\nthat some data has to be retained for\na set period in time.\n\n320\n00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:47.480\nSo all of this is discussed by\nthe process forum, as well as innovation.\n\n321\n00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:52.236\nSomething new that's come that it\ncould again fall under the banner of\n\n322\n00:19:52.236 --> 00:19:53.292\nimprovement.\n\n323\n00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:56.320\nI always like to say everything\nthat we do in IT is to improve.\n\n324\n00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.091\nWe never wanna do anything\nto make life worse.\n\n325\n00:19:59.091 --> 00:20:03.313\n[LAUGH] Sometimes we do do things to make\nlife worse, right, or then rather it's\n\n326\n00:20:03.313 --> 00:20:07.170\na result of the changes that we made,\nbut we never do that deliberately.\n\n327\n00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:11.190\nEven stress testing is done to\nensure that in a live environment,\n\n328\n00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.220\nsomething doesn't fail.\n\n329\n00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.902\nSo it's done to make things better.\n\n330\n00:20:14.902 --> 00:20:19.920\nBut innovation's all about,\nwell I like to say the shiny new toys.\n\n331\n00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:25.350\nThat's what it's about, testing the shiny\nnew toys, and testing a new product,\n\n332\n00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:30.590\nand also new software, and\nnew functionality, and with our processes.\n\n333\n00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:35.020\nWe like to think that we can\nautomate a lot of our process, and\n\n334\n00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.610\nwe introduce something\ncalled process models, and\n\n335\n00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:41.940\nwe'll look at that a little\nbit later in another episode.\n\n336\n00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:46.200\nThat's to improve the efficiency of our\nprocesses and if we can automate, and\n\n337\n00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.460\nas long as we've got\nthe process well defined,\n\n338\n00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:52.750\nthen we will be able to automate,\nand again, that could be innovation.\n\n339\n00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.146\nSo again, we're making decisions, but\n\n340\n00:20:55.146 --> 00:20:59.370\nwith a board we're making decisions\nat this level, strategic level.\n\n341\n00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:03.500\nHere, we're making decisions\nat a tactical level, and\n\n342\n00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:10.600\nthen we've got this third structural\nelement, and that is the working group.\n\n343\n00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.910\nNow the working group.\n\n344\n00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.740\nGenerally it's got the people\nas the process forum,\n\n345\n00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.290\nbut this is very much ad-hoc.\n\n346\n00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:24.260\nYou can combine again to the same meeting,\nbut this is very reactive.\n\n347\n00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.810\nSo if you were to combine\nit into the same meeting,\n\n348\n00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:31.280\nyou'd have to have the proactive side,\nwhere we discussed our plans, and\n\n349\n00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.750\nthen we'd have the reactive side\nwhere we discussed what had happened.\n\n350\n00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.450\nSomething that we need to look at.\n\n351\n00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:44.710\nSo for instance, just as an example,\nwe would convene a working\n\n352\n00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:49.760\ngroup when we had a major incident,\nthe whole organization went down.\n\n353\n00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:55.110\nSo within a SIAM ecosystem, incident\nmanagement, especially major incidents,\n\n354\n00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:59.700\ncan be a huge challenge to manage,\nbecause you're involving a lot of players.\n\n355\n00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.030\nBut most importantly,\n\n356\n00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:05.883\nyou're involving a lot of players that are\nworking within different organizations,\n\n357\n00:22:05.883 --> 00:22:09.619\nand those both key players maybe\nworking within different walls.\n\n358\n00:22:09.619 --> 00:22:13.716\nCertainly within a different\ninfrastructure, but they may be working\n\n359\n00:22:13.716 --> 00:22:18.563\nwith different standards, they may be\nworking with different call login systems,\n\n360\n00:22:18.563 --> 00:22:22.452\nso a major incident is pretty much,\nwell, a nightmare to manage for\n\n361\n00:22:22.452 --> 00:22:24.040\nthat service integrator.\n\n362\n00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:28.430\nSo it's something that we have to be,\nthe process forum has got to be\n\n363\n00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:32.282\ncompletely transparent on what\na major incident entails,\n\n364\n00:22:32.282 --> 00:22:35.131\nwhat should be done in a major incident,\nand\n\n365\n00:22:35.131 --> 00:22:39.982\nwhich process to follow in a major\nincident, and that in itself again can be\n\n366\n00:22:39.982 --> 00:22:46.040\na challenge because you don't know what's\ngonna go wrong until something goes wrong.\n\n367\n00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:49.240\nSo working out what you're gonna\ndo with it when it goes wrong, and\n\n368\n00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:54.100\nespecially then working out how you\nare going to coordinate a major incident\n\n369\n00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:59.340\nacross all of those providers, yeah,\nthat's a nightmare for planning.\n\n370\n00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.895\nBut then when something\ndoes actually go wrong,\n\n371\n00:23:02.895 --> 00:23:08.612\nwhat we want to do is after we've got it\nresolved, we bring in a working group,\n\n372\n00:23:08.612 --> 00:23:12.705\nand that working group will\nreview the major incident.\n\n373\n00:23:12.705 --> 00:23:15.120\nThey'll review the content\nof the major incident.\n\n374\n00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.240\nWhat happened?\n\n375\n00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.800\nWhat could be done better\nfrom a technical perspective?\n\n376\n00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.000\nBut they will also review\nfrom a process perspective.\n\n377\n00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:25.430\nWhere did we fail?\n\n378\n00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:28.150\nWhere were we not as\nefficient as we could be?\n\n379\n00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:30.810\nWhere were we not as\neffective as we could be?\n\n380\n00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.270\nWhat training is required?\n\n381\n00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:38.070\nAnd this is where we may even involve\nlooking at the contracts that exist\n\n382\n00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:41.320\nto ensure that the incident is moved\n\n383\n00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:46.160\nfrom one service provider to\nthe other in a seamless fashion.\n\n384\n00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.303\nJustin, I know that you've been\nstood here right here next to me\n\n385\n00:23:49.303 --> 00:23:52.619\nlooking quite perplexed at this for\nthe last few minutes, so tell me\n\n386\n00:23:52.619 --> 00:23:55.952\nwhat you're looking perplexed about.\n&gt;&gt; It's not a little,\n\n387\n00:23:55.952 --> 00:24:00.597\nthis is my churning face, and\nI've kinda been thinking about\n\n388\n00:24:00.597 --> 00:24:04.707\nthese key performance indicators and\nhow the process forms.\n\n389\n00:24:04.707 --> 00:24:08.692\nAnd I wanna make sure, even if you\nhave a key performance indicator,\n\n390\n00:24:08.692 --> 00:24:12.950\nI'm coming back to working groups,\nthat you're not meeting, right?\n\n391\n00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.547\nThat you have some kind of,\nthat is about reflection,\n\n392\n00:24:16.547 --> 00:24:19.216\nabout the respective process, right?\n\n393\n00:24:19.216 --> 00:24:24.113\nTo make things better, or maybe to even\nchange that process because it didn't\n\n394\n00:24:24.113 --> 00:24:28.950\nwork out quite like you thought it would\ninitially, and do I have that wrong?\n\n395\n00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:29.458\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n396\n00:24:29.458 --> 00:24:32.650\nokay, but\nthis is what the process forum would do.\n\n397\n00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:36.520\nSo there's a difference between the\nprocess forum and a working group, okay.\n\n398\n00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.920\nSo on a regular basis,\nwe produce what we call SLAM charts,\n\n399\n00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.010\nservice level agreement monitoring charts.\n\n400\n00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:45.860\nThese are our RAG charts, red,\namber, green, traffic light charts.\n\n401\n00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.522\nAnd we'll produce those\non a regular basis.\n\n402\n00:24:48.522 --> 00:24:52.810\nNow, just a simple question, actually,\nwhat color do you think I want to see on\n\n403\n00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.312\na SLAM chart?\n&gt;&gt; A service level agreement monitor,\n\n404\n00:24:55.312 --> 00:24:56.317\nI'm guessing-\n&gt;&gt; Red,\n\n405\n00:24:56.317 --> 00:24:56.981\namber, green?\n&gt;&gt; Green?\n\n406\n00:24:56.981 --> 00:24:59.580\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not, no.\n\n407\n00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:00.128\n&gt;&gt; It's backwards.\n\n408\n00:25:00.128 --> 00:25:02.254\n&gt;&gt; Right, because you see, and\n\n409\n00:25:02.254 --> 00:25:06.940\nthis is a huge big misconception\nwith service level management.\n\n410\n00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:12.200\nIf I go to a customer,\nwe're delivering value to a customer.\n\n411\n00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.236\nIf I go to a customer and\n\n412\n00:25:13.236 --> 00:25:16.413\nyou have presented them months after\nmonths with a set of green KPIs.\n\n413\n00:25:16.413 --> 00:25:20.908\nAnd if I ask them whether they\nperceive value in that service,\n\n414\n00:25:20.908 --> 00:25:24.570\nI will guarantee that they will say no.\n\n415\n00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:27.835\nAnd that tells me that if they're\nnot perceiving value, but\n\n416\n00:25:27.835 --> 00:25:32.263\nyour SLAM charts are looking all green,\nthen you're measuring the wrong thing.\n\n417\n00:25:32.263 --> 00:25:36.333\nI'm looking for areas where we\ncan improve, I'm not looking for\n\n418\n00:25:36.333 --> 00:25:38.200\nwhat's worked.\n\n419\n00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:42.720\nAnd that's the role of the process forum,\nis to look at those KPIs on a regular\n\n420\n00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:47.930\nbasis, say monthly, and\nascertain where we could do better.\n\n421\n00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:52.108\nThe working group, well,\nthe working group looks at ad hoc things,\n\n422\n00:25:52.108 --> 00:25:54.380\nthings that aren't planned.\n\n423\n00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:59.070\nWe plan to have a process forum every\nmonth, we plan to produce our SLAM charts\n\n424\n00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:02.760\nevery month, for instance,\nit might be every three months.\n\n425\n00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.311\nBut we don't plan to\nhave a major incident.\n\n426\n00:26:04.311 --> 00:26:07.327\nWell, I'd like to think that\nwe don't plan, if we do,\n\n427\n00:26:07.327 --> 00:26:11.710\nthen there's something seriously wrong\nwith [LAUGH] our IT services provision.\n\n428\n00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:14.604\nAnd we need to kind of working\non that more than anything else.\n\n429\n00:26:14.604 --> 00:26:17.150\nBut we don't plan to\nhave a major incident.\n\n430\n00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:20.927\nAnd so this is why the working\ngroup convenes on an ad hoc basis,\n\n431\n00:26:20.927 --> 00:26:24.530\nto review things like major incidents,\nfor instance.\n\n432\n00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:28.532\nSomething that's happened that was\nunexpected, does that make sense?\n\n433\n00:26:28.532 --> 00:26:29.328\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense,\n\n434\n00:26:29.328 --> 00:26:31.530\nI do have a couple of\nquestions about that, though.\n\n435\n00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:34.608\nSo the working group is addressing\nthings that happened, uh-oh,\n\n436\n00:26:34.608 --> 00:26:36.180\nsomething unexpected happened.\n\n437\n00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:40.295\nBut we would have a process in\nplace to address those ideally,\n\n438\n00:26:40.295 --> 00:26:44.390\nwhich would be pre-planned\nby the process forms.\n\n439\n00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:48.170\nOnce the working group evaluates and\nfixes that, then another process forum\n\n440\n00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:52.150\nwill evaluate the process that\naddressed that unplanned thing,\n\n441\n00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:53.044\ndo I have that right?\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n442\n00:26:53.044 --> 00:26:55.877\n[INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was super, so I was trying\n\n443\n00:26:55.877 --> 00:27:00.740\nto figure out, cuz there's this feedback\nloop within these groups, all right?\n\n444\n00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:05.600\nLike, hey, we address this, this is gonna\ncome back, we need to proactively plan.\n\n445\n00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.685\nBecause this went well,\nor this didn't go well.\n\n446\n00:27:09.685 --> 00:27:13.110\nAnd then if it happens again,\nthen there's an additional eval.\n\n447\n00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:16.563\nBut I think that comes back to those\ndiscrete, like, let's evaluate whether\n\n448\n00:27:16.563 --> 00:27:19.825\nthis is working for us or not, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right, and this is why,\n\n449\n00:27:19.825 --> 00:27:24.477\nin that first bullet point there,\nI mentioned that your process forum and\n\n450\n00:27:24.477 --> 00:27:29.240\nyour working group could be\ncombined into the same meeting.\n\n451\n00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.440\nAnd invariably it is, but every now and\n\n452\n00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.120\nthen, you might need\nan actual working group.\n\n453\n00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.780\nLet's say we've got\na particularly difficult problem\n\n454\n00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:38.730\nthat we've got to look at.\n\n455\n00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:42.070\nAnd we've gotta find the real cause, then\nwe'll convene a working group to do that.\n\n456\n00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:46.492\nAnd so we'll convene a problem\nmanagement working group to not just\n\n457\n00:27:46.492 --> 00:27:48.052\nidentify root causes.\n\n458\n00:27:48.052 --> 00:27:52.239\nBut to actually go through all of\nthe problem management techniques used in\n\n459\n00:27:52.239 --> 00:27:53.771\nidentifying root causes.\n\n460\n00:27:53.771 --> 00:27:56.216\nSuch as going through\nsort of Kepner-Tregoe or\n\n461\n00:27:56.216 --> 00:27:59.955\ngoing through the Ishikawa, or\nany other problem analysis technique.\n\n462\n00:27:59.955 --> 00:28:03.156\nWe're gonna talk about that later,\ndon't worry, Justin.\n\n463\n00:28:03.156 --> 00:28:06.898\nBut looking at sort of root\ncause diagnoses, and so\n\n464\n00:28:06.898 --> 00:28:10.400\nyou can convene a working\ngroup to do that.\n\n465\n00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.210\nIt's exactly as it says on the tin,\nit's a working group.\n\n466\n00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.840\nIt's not just an ad hoc group,\n\n467\n00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.550\nit's not crisis management,\nthis is a working group.\n\n468\n00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:24.210\nSo we think of it in incident management\nin terms of a crisis management group.\n\n469\n00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:27.030\nBut that's what an incident is,\nit's an interruption to service.\n\n470\n00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.040\nAnd therefore, if it's a major incident\nand it requires a working group,\n\n471\n00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.530\nthen that is crisis management.\n\n472\n00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:36.176\nWhereas the problem\nmanagement working group,\n\n473\n00:28:36.176 --> 00:28:39.780\nwell, that's a working group that\nwe convene to resolve a problem.\n\n474\n00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.310\nAnd it's the same with change\nmanagement and anything else.\n\n475\n00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:45.840\nWe can convene working groups\nto come up with ideas as well.\n\n476\n00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:50.660\nBut it's not ideas for the process,\nit's ideas for a particular change or\n\n477\n00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:53.040\nfor a particular problem.\n\n478\n00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.960\nOr it's a working group to discuss\na particular major incident.\n\n479\n00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:03.370\nSo the working group is called,\nit's convened for a specific reason.\n\n480\n00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:08.600\nWhereas the process forum is there to look\nat those improvements that you mentioned.\n\n481\n00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.570\nNow, as I said,\nyou can combine them, and I would.\n\n482\n00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:18.155\nBut if you've had a major incident,\nplease don't wait for\n\n483\n00:29:18.155 --> 00:29:21.705\nthree weeks before you actually\nthen review that major incident.\n\n484\n00:29:21.705 --> 00:29:26.155\nBecause trust me, a lot of water has\npassed the bridge since then, and\n\n485\n00:29:26.155 --> 00:29:29.045\nyou will have forgotten\nmost of what happened.\n\n486\n00:29:29.045 --> 00:29:32.845\nSo if you have a major incident and\nyour process forum is not for\n\n487\n00:29:32.845 --> 00:29:37.743\nanother three weeks, then you need to be\ncalling a working group to discuss that\n\n488\n00:29:37.743 --> 00:29:39.738\nmajor incident there and then.\n\n489\n00:29:39.738 --> 00:29:43.790\nAnd then we make recommendations that\nwe take to the next process forum.\n\n490\n00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.530\nYou're nodding,\nthat's a good thing, right?\n\n491\n00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:48.060\n&gt;&gt; That makes,\n\n492\n00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.610\nI mean,\nfrom just an intuitive standpoint, right?\n\n493\n00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:55.020\nThe sooner you address a major incident,\n\n494\n00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.840\nthe more likely that you're going to have\ngood memory and appropriate records.\n\n495\n00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.740\nAnd the more data that you can collect, if\nthere were additional questions that come\n\n496\n00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.580\nup about what is the root\ncause of this incident.\n\n497\n00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:09.430\nSo that makes sense with all of that\ninformation passing on to the next\n\n498\n00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:10.690\nprocess forum.\n\n499\n00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:14.790\nTo create a proactive approach\nto hopefully better address\n\n500\n00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:19.240\nthe next thing that would occur right?\n&gt;&gt; You distracted me, you completely\n\n501\n00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.100\ndistracted me, cuz you started talking\nabout root causes of incidents.\n\n502\n00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:28.053\nAnd I want to cry and I want to run\naway now because that's a problem.\n\n503\n00:30:28.053 --> 00:30:33.670\nNo, literally, that's a problem,\na root cause of an incident is a problem.\n\n504\n00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:39.600\nSo we don't call a working group to\ndiscuss the root cause of an incident,\n\n505\n00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.440\nwe call a working group\nto discuss the problem.\n\n506\n00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.640\nYeah, I know, you think I'm being\nreally pedantic here, and I am.\n\n507\n00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.510\nBut you know what,\n\n508\n00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:50.350\nyou guys have got a test to pass,\nyou've got a test to pass as well, right.\n\n509\n00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:52.460\nWe're gonna get our\nnaming conventions right.\n\n510\n00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.295\nAn incident is an interruption\nto a service, and\n\n511\n00:30:57.295 --> 00:30:59.650\na problem is what's caused it.\n\n512\n00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:04.110\nAnd you know what, I'm gonna advise\nJustin, we're gonna take a break and\n\n513\n00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:07.670\nJustin's gonna watch a tiny\nlittle episode that I did,.\n\n514\n00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:13.350\nIt's under the section in\nthe library under ITIL,\n\n515\n00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:18.602\nand there a tiny little episode that\nI did called incident versus problem.\n\n516\n00:31:18.602 --> 00:31:22.780\nAnd Justin's going to watch that\nas we take a break now before we\n\n517\n00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.750\nstart our next episode.\n\n518\n00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:27.550\nAnd our next episode is\nlooking at SIAM drivers.\n\n519\n00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:31.930\nAnd before we do that, though, Justin's\ngoing to watch that little episode that we\n\n520\n00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:35.450\ndid on incident versus problem.\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you have it, ladies and\n\n521\n00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:38.610\ngentlemen, I'm gonna go stand in\nthe corner with my dunce hat and\n\n522\n00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:40.290\njust kind of wallow in in my shame.\n\n523\n00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:41.984\nBut in all seriousness,\n\n524\n00:31:41.984 --> 00:31:45.945\nhaving an appropriate\nterminology to have discussions.\n\n525\n00:31:45.945 --> 00:31:51.520\nAnd a full disclosure, Jo is outside\nof my wheelhouse with her expertise.\n\n526\n00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:56.080\nSo there are going to be continual\nthings like this where, for\n\n527\n00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:00.825\nsomeone who's coming into this new, it is\ngood to have everything on the same page.\n\n528\n00:32:00.825 --> 00:32:02.600\nSo these things happen,\n\n529\n00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.990\nand definitely join us back as we\ncontinue working through SIAM.\n\n530\n00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:07.990\nBut I got a few things I've gotta do,\napparently,\n\n531\n00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:10.410\nbefore the next episode, so come on back.\n\n532\n00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:13.525\nBut for now, we're gonna get out of here.\n&gt;&gt; Well actually, before we do,\n\n533\n00:32:13.525 --> 00:32:16.771\njust before we do sign out,\nI just want to say something.\n\n534\n00:32:16.771 --> 00:32:21.754\nAnd that is, one of the reasons\nwhy we do this is exactly for\n\n535\n00:32:21.754 --> 00:32:25.440\nthe reasons that we talked about just now.\n\n536\n00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.307\nIt's the fact that we wanna make sure that\neverybody's getting the same consistency\n\n537\n00:32:29.307 --> 00:32:30.334\nand training as well.\n\n538\n00:32:30.334 --> 00:32:35.340\nAnd these are the questions\nthat everybody always asks.\n\n539\n00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.381\nAnd so I would never feel any sort of\ncertain type of way about asking any\n\n540\n00:32:39.381 --> 00:32:40.145\nquestions.\n\n541\n00:32:40.145 --> 00:32:43.870\nBecause these are the questions\nthat you don't know unless you ask.\n\n542\n00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:47.200\nAnd there's plenty about Justin's\nrole that I haven't got a clue\n\n543\n00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.883\nabout.\n&gt;&gt; That's funny, Jo, because me too, I\n\n544\n00:32:49.883 --> 00:32:54.940\ndon't know what I don't know, and I guess\nwe'll figure it out as we continue on.\n\n545\n00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.970\nBut we're gonna go ahead and get out\nof here, so signing off for ITProTV,\n\n546\n00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.240\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n547\n00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.720\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n548\n00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:08.252\n[MUSIC]\n\n549\n00:33:08.252 --> 00:33:11.940\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV\n\n",

Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:06.877 --> 00:00:11.685\nCalifornia\n&gt;&gt; Your watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:12.845\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:15.631\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:19.155\nI am your host Justin Dennison, and\nwe are continuing on with SIAM Foundation.\n\n7\n00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:23.139\nAnd we are gonna be looking\nat satisfaction, excuse me,\n\n8\n00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:26.550\nservice satisfaction, my goodness.\n\n9\n00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.230\nI got it out.\n\n10\n00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.130\nI worked on it.\n\n11\n00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.660\nBut luckily, we have someone who's\nprobably a little more eloquent than I am\n\n12\n00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.840\nwhen talking about SIAM.\n\n13\n00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.620\nMiss Jo Peacock,\nhow are you doing today, Jo?\n\n14\n00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.121\n&gt;&gt; I'm absolutely fine, Justin,\n\n15\n00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:38.433\nhow are you?\n&gt;&gt; Well, a little tongue tied.\n\n16\n00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:39.732\n&gt;&gt; Struggling slightly, right?\n\n17\n00:00:39.732 --> 00:00:42.457\n&gt;&gt; A little tongue tied, but we are human.\n\n18\n00:00:42.457 --> 00:00:47.130\nThose are to be expected things, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, yep, I'm not going.\n\n19\n00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.181\nI am apparently, I am Wonder Woman.\n&gt;&gt; Famous last words,\n\n20\n00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:56.518\nI'm gonna be like, I'm like hold on,\nhere it comes, here it comes.\n\n21\n00:00:56.518 --> 00:00:57.358\nNo, I jest, but\n\n22\n00:00:57.358 --> 00:01:00.910\nwe're gonna be talking about service\nsatisfaction in this episode.\n\n23\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.050\nAnd you know that my idea of satisfaction\nmay be a little bit different than\n\n24\n00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.832\nwhat we're gonna be talking about here.\n&gt;&gt; We're not going there, right?\n\n25\n00:01:08.832 --> 00:01:09.762\nWe are definitely,\n\n26\n00:01:09.762 --> 00:01:12.949\ndefinitely not going there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You give me a whole bunch of\n\n27\n00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:13.957\nsideways there.\n\n28\n00:01:13.957 --> 00:01:15.824\nI'm talking about like, yeah,\n\n29\n00:01:15.824 --> 00:01:18.826\nI'm satisfied with the service\nthat you provided to me.\n\n30\n00:01:18.826 --> 00:01:21.653\nIs that what we're talking about?\n&gt;&gt; A few seconds ago he was running around\n\n31\n00:01:21.653 --> 00:01:23.289\nsinging the Rolling Stones,\n\n32\n00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.263\nwhich was not a pretty site, so-\n&gt;&gt; You're not supposed to give away\n\n33\n00:01:26.263 --> 00:01:27.330\nmy secrets.\n&gt;&gt; Right, well no,\n\n34\n00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.110\nwe're definitely not going there,\nactually we're gonna look at SIAM drivers.\n\n35\n00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.122\nOne of them is service satisfaction,\nyes, but\n\n36\n00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:40.212\nwe're actually on a sort of\na small mini series at the moment.\n\n37\n00:01:40.212 --> 00:01:43.350\nWe started off with episode\none of that small mini series,\n\n38\n00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.280\nand we're looking at SIAM drivers.\n\n39\n00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.880\nSo the first thing that we are gonna\ndo is we're gonna take a look at what\n\n40\n00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.930\na driver is.\n\n41\n00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.730\nWe're gonna look at the five different\ntypes of drivers that we have within SIAM.\n\n42\n00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.120\nAnd then,\nwe're gonna spend some time, yes,\n\n43\n00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.070\nwe are gonna be talking\nabout service satisfaction.\n\n44\n00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.844\nAnd how we keep our customers happy.\n\n45\n00:02:02.844 --> 00:02:05.181\nSo really just to start off with,\n\n46\n00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:09.947\nwe're gonna do a quick recap over\nour layers of the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n47\n00:02:09.947 --> 00:02:14.017\nAnd if you remember,\nwe had three layers to the,\n\n48\n00:02:14.017 --> 00:02:17.205\nsee look at it, now I'm struggling.\n\n49\n00:02:17.205 --> 00:02:22.252\nWhat is it that you don't.\n&gt;&gt; Famous last words, I'm wonder woman and\n\n50\n00:02:22.252 --> 00:02:25.930\nthen it would, you're like,\nwho am I again?\n\n51\n00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.090\nBut I believe in you Jo.\n\n52\n00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.660\nYou'll get it done.\n&gt;&gt; Nothing to do with his\n\n53\n00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.610\ninfluence, right?\n\n54\n00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.050\nNothing at all.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not.\n\n55\n00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.542\nIt's unrelated to the things that\n\n56\n00:02:32.542 --> 00:02:33.369\nhappened with me.\n\n57\n00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:34.145\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n58\n00:02:34.145 --> 00:02:36.097\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you say this is rubbing off,\n\n59\n00:02:36.097 --> 00:02:37.490\nI can't do this anymore.\n\n60\n00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.895\n[LAUGH] Yeah, we are looking at SIAM, and\nwe're looking at the SIAM ecosystem and\n\n61\n00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:45.607\nthe three layers of the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n62\n00:02:45.607 --> 00:02:50.449\nSo if you recall from the previous\nepisodes, we had our customer layer.\n\n63\n00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:54.695\nAnd the customer layer, well,\nthat provides us with requirements.\n\n64\n00:02:54.695 --> 00:03:00.440\nAnd we have to align ourselves\nwith requirements of our customer.\n\n65\n00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.520\nAnd by we, I mean the bottom two layers,\nand that's a service integrated layer.\n\n66\n00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.940\nThink about those as the translators and\nthe managers of our services.\n\n67\n00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.070\nAnd then, we have our service provider\nlayer, and our service provider layer,\n\n68\n00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.080\ninvariably, well, is made up of\nmore than one service provider.\n\n69\n00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.100\nNow, of course, and I did get asked this\non a regular basis about the difference\n\n70\n00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.560\nbetween ITIL and SIAM.\n\n71\n00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.425\nAnd I can't tell you that ITIL is very,\n\n72\n00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:38.965\nvery good as a management methodology for\nmanaging a single service provider.\n\n73\n00:03:38.965 --> 00:03:41.535\nHowever, the SIAM ecosystem,\n\n74\n00:03:41.535 --> 00:03:46.012\nas we call it, looks at the possibility,\nwhich let's face it,\n\n75\n00:03:46.012 --> 00:03:50.532\nis quite a reality nowadays,\nof having multiple service providers.\n\n76\n00:03:50.532 --> 00:03:55.802\nA multiple service provider is to\nan organization that is spread across\n\n77\n00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:58.192\nmany different organizations.\n\n78\n00:03:58.192 --> 00:04:00.932\nSo they could potentially be internal, and\n\n79\n00:04:00.932 --> 00:04:04.602\nthey could potentially be external\nservice providers, as well.\n\n80\n00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.800\nSo here in our SIAM ecosystem,\nwhen we are managing the drivers for\n\n81\n00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.760\nthe SIAM ecosystem itself, we have to\nbear in mind that one of the main reasons\n\n82\n00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.430\nwhy we're using this particular\nmethodology over and above ITIL.\n\n83\n00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.760\nBy the way, we will probably have already\nbeen using ITIL, anyway, in the past.\n\n84\n00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.560\nBut the reason why we're implementing\na SIAM ecosystem is because\n\n85\n00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.570\nwe have that added complexity of\nhaving the multiple service providers.\n\n86\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.660\nAs I've already said,\nITIL is very, very good for\n\n87\n00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.940\nmanaging that single service\nprovider organization.\n\n88\n00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.140\nAnd in one of our previous episodes,\nand in fact, what I can do\n\n89\n00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.900\nright now is I'm gonna go back to a\nparticular slide from a previous episode.\n\n90\n00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.940\nAnd I'd just like to take a look\nat this one very, very quickly.\n\n91\n00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.735\nAnd in a traditional\nmulti-sorting environment,\n\n92\n00:04:57.735 --> 00:05:01.170\nwhich is a traditional environment,\nwe have an IT department.\n\n93\n00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.250\nNow that could be internal, or it could\nexternal but invariably, it's internal.\n\n94\n00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.200\nAnd it's split into various different\nfunctional areas, as we call them,\n\n95\n00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:18.430\nwhich are in house, and then we outsource\ncertain tasks or certain activities.\n\n96\n00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.200\nSo certain what we might call components\nof a service, now if you remember,\n\n97\n00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.712\nthe components of a service are everything\nthat we need to deliver a service.\n\n98\n00:05:28.712 --> 00:05:31.660\nWell, these components\nare our software and\n\n99\n00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.440\nour hardware,\nenvironmental components, the people,\n\n100\n00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.630\nthe infrastructure,\nour documentation, and our contracts.\n\n101\n00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.400\nAll of those are needed in order\nto be able to deliver a service.\n\n102\n00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.350\nAnd so in the traditional environment,\n\n103\n00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.180\nwe have our internal service provider,\nor a single service provider, and\n\n104\n00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.040\nthen way down that hierarchical tree,\nwe may outsource certain tasks.\n\n105\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.272\nSo we may outsource certain\ncomponents of a particular service.\n\n106\n00:06:02.272 --> 00:06:03.807\nAnd ITIL works very,\n\n107\n00:06:03.807 --> 00:06:09.598\nvery well as a management architecture\nin that particular environment.\n\n108\n00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:13.400\nBut the SIAM environment,\nlet's take a look at step three there,\n\n109\n00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.820\nthe total outsource in\nthe multisourcing environment.\n\n110\n00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.780\nAnd this is where the SIAM architecture,\nor ecosystem as we call it, works better.\n\n111\n00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.360\nBecause the SIAM ecosystem\nallows us to compensate, and\n\n112\n00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.260\nto consider, for all of the nuances and\nall of the contractual obligations,\n\n113\n00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.050\nand all of the complexity, as well, that\ncomes with managing multiple vendors and\n\n114\n00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.610\nmultiple suppliers.\n\n115\n00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.260\nAnd those multiple suppliers\nbeing suppliers from various\n\n116\n00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.880\ndifferent locations, potentially various\nlocations around the world, as well, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.350\nSo here we are in SIAM, so\nwhy would we want to change?\n\n118\n00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.920\nWell, we've already discussed\nthe complexity, and so\n\n119\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.660\nI want to take a look at our SIAM drivers.\n\n120\n00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.760\nAnd by drivers,\n\n121\n00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.200\nwe mean something that gives us impetus,\nsomething that creates a change.\n\n122\n00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.050\nA driver is something that we use\nthat gives us that necessity.\n\n123\n00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.630\nIt gives us that need,\nso it creates a desire.\n\n124\n00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.460\nNow, I don't know, Justin,\nwhether you have ever considered,\n\n125\n00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.350\nor ever looked,\nat any organizational change management.\n\n126\n00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.310\nIs that something that you have?\n&gt;&gt; No, Jo,\n\n127\n00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.840\nI'm gonna be completely transparent.\n\n128\n00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.270\nI try to just keep my head down and\nnot, right,\n\n129\n00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.190\nmy experience as a developer by nature.\n\n130\n00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.951\nAnd we tend to, when things like that\nstart happening, kinda focus in, zone in,\n\n131\n00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:45.196\nagain, nothing to see here,\nI just wanna do my work.\n\n132\n00:07:45.196 --> 00:07:48.523\nThat's kind of our weird nature, right?\n&gt;&gt; Well, and this, it's funny,\n\n133\n00:07:48.523 --> 00:07:51.637\ncuz this is one of the reasons why I\nabsolutely love working with Justin.\n\n134\n00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:57.495\nBecause Justin is looking at this from\nThe perspective of most people in IT,\n\n135\n00:07:57.495 --> 00:07:58.970\nit's true to say.\n\n136\n00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:04.552\nAnd most people in IT, especially the get\ninvolved in SAIM, get involved in ITIL,\n\n137\n00:08:04.552 --> 00:08:10.270\nor even in Agile, they are really coming\ninto this from a techie perspective.\n\n138\n00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:14.330\nAnd trying to understand and trying to\nfigure out what it actually means to them\n\n139\n00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.570\nand what it means to their environment.\n\n140\n00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.452\nAnd this is why I love\nworking with Justin,\n\n141\n00:08:18.452 --> 00:08:21.923\nbecause we can have such interesting\nconversations about this sort of thing.\n\n142\n00:08:21.923 --> 00:08:23.980\nA lot of these are off camera as well.\n\n143\n00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.745\nPerhaps we should try and\nrecord them one day.\n\n144\n00:08:25.745 --> 00:08:29.953\n[LAUGH] But I mention organizational\nchange management, because you see,\n\n145\n00:08:29.953 --> 00:08:32.972\nwe do a lot of technical\nchange management within IT.\n\n146\n00:08:32.972 --> 00:08:36.562\nAnd we change our services\non a regular basis and\n\n147\n00:08:36.562 --> 00:08:41.872\nthe components of our services on\na regular basis, but you know what?\n\n148\n00:08:41.872 --> 00:08:47.570\nNo change is ever gonna stick unless\nyou have created a need for change.\n\n149\n00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.083\nLet's go back to sorta human nature.\n\n150\n00:08:50.083 --> 00:08:54.142\nAnd the very basic human nature is that\nunless you tell me that something is\n\n151\n00:08:54.142 --> 00:08:56.051\na good idea, I'm not gonna do it.\n\n152\n00:08:56.051 --> 00:09:00.680\nAnd we look at this as\nresistance to change.\n\n153\n00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.400\nAnd resistance to change is, quite simply,\nthat five year old that turns around and\n\n154\n00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.210\nsays, no, I'm not gonna do it, or the\nthree year old that asks why all the time.\n\n155\n00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.580\nWhy are you asking me to do this?\n\n156\n00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.410\nAnd in IT, certainly when it comes to\nmanagement methodologies, in order for\n\n157\n00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:21.750\nany change to stick, in order for\nit to work, we have to\n\n158\n00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:27.270\nbe able to answer the question for\neverybody of, what's in it for me?\n\n159\n00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.580\nIf I cannot answer that question, then\nyou're not gonna come along with me, and\n\n160\n00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.790\nyou're not gonna be on board with this.\n\n161\n00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:41.040\nSo if I want to implement a SIAM\necosystem, if I want to move from,\n\n162\n00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.720\nand this is where most organizations are,\nthey're in an ITIL based methodology.\n\n163\n00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.200\nAnd they've realized that they\nhave additional complexity.\n\n164\n00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:55.366\nAnd so what they want to do is they want\nto move from the ITIL based methodology,\n\n165\n00:09:55.366 --> 00:10:00.160\nthey want to evolve in order to\nbe able to manage the complexity.\n\n166\n00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.080\nSo we have to answer the question,\nthen, well, what's in it for me?\n\n167\n00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.550\nWhat am I gonna get out of\nmoving to a SIAM ecosystem?\n\n168\n00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.280\nBecause it's a change, and\nit's a change to the environment.\n\n169\n00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.482\nAnd as a change, it's what we call\nan organizational change, and\n\n170\n00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:21.660\nas an organizational change, then we have\nto perform a degree of what we call OCM,\n\n171\n00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.080\norganizational change management.\n\n172\n00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.860\nThe first step in OCM is to answer\nthe question, what's in it for me?\n\n173\n00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.732\nWhich means that we have\nto identify the drivers,\n\n174\n00:10:34.732 --> 00:10:40.423\nthe need for change,\nthe need to move to a SIAM ecosystem.\n\n175\n00:10:40.423 --> 00:10:45.599\nAnd we use those drivers to\narticulate the business value.\n\n176\n00:10:45.599 --> 00:10:48.477\nBecause without any value then you\nhave to ask the question, well,\n\n177\n00:10:48.477 --> 00:10:50.580\nwhy on earth are you doing it?\n\n178\n00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.274\nSo we have to identify the business\nvalue of moving to SIAM.\n\n179\n00:10:54.274 --> 00:10:57.510\nI called it an evolution.\n\n180\n00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:02.608\nIt's evolving, and\nwe're generally evolving from an ITIL or\n\n181\n00:11:02.608 --> 00:11:05.600\nISO 20000 based methodology.\n\n182\n00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.825\nAnd that's what we moving from,\nand so we're evolving.\n\n183\n00:11:09.825 --> 00:11:13.550\nWe're expanding, because we want\nto manage that complexity that\n\n184\n00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.490\ncomes with the multiple service providers.\n\n185\n00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:21.014\nWhich means that we have to\nidentify the drivers that will\n\n186\n00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.758\ndemonstrate the business value.\n\n187\n00:11:23.758 --> 00:11:27.037\nYou have to justify everything\nin an organization,\n\n188\n00:11:27.037 --> 00:11:29.800\nespecially if it involves spending money.\n\n189\n00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.330\nBut if it involves change,\nthen change means upheaval.\n\n190\n00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:37.710\nAnd that means a certain\nperiod of discomfort,\n\n191\n00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.060\na certain period of low morale, and\n\n192\n00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:44.640\na certain period of, potentially, if it's\nmanaged correctly it shouldn't be, but\n\n193\n00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.530\na certain period of potential chaos\nwhere there's some uncertainty going on.\n\n194\n00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.970\nAnd there will definitely,\ndefinitely be a certain\n\n195\n00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:57.920\nperiod of less than optimum\nproduction should we say.\n\n196\n00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:03.420\nPeople are not gonna be working at 100% of\ntheir capability because you know what,\n\n197\n00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.260\nit's like yourself.\n\n198\n00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.110\nIf you're feeling a little bit unsettled,\nyou're not gonna do your best work.\n\n199\n00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:12.980\nBecause what you're gonna do is you're\ngonna be concentrating on the speculation\n\n200\n00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:17.420\nand on the rumors and on everything\nelse other than doing your work.\n\n201\n00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.710\nSo we have five drivers, the SIAM.\n\n202\n00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.800\nIn other words, we have five reasons,\nif you want to call it that,\n\n203\n00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.870\nfor evolving to a SIAM ecosystem.\n\n204\n00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:35.120\nAnd the first one, as Justin's already\nmentioned, is service satisfaction.\n\n205\n00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.590\nOur customers need to be\nsatisfied with their services, and\n\n206\n00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.220\nmaybe they're not right now.\n\n207\n00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.670\nMaybe things aren't quite\ngoing as they should do.\n\n208\n00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:48.080\nMaybe there's an issue with maybe\nincident management, for instance,\n\n209\n00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.430\nbecause we've not quite got\nthe organization right,\n\n210\n00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.730\nbecause we've got multiple\nservice providers.\n\n211\n00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.660\nWe also have other drivers that we\nwill be looking at in other episodes.\n\n212\n00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.320\nAs I say, this is our first\nof our sort of miniseries.\n\n213\n00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.266\nAnd the second driver would be our\nservice and source in landscape,\n\n214\n00:13:05.266 --> 00:13:10.750\nand then we've got our third driver\nof operational efficiencies.\n\n215\n00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.720\nIn other words,\nwe want to become more efficient, and\n\n216\n00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.100\nthen we've got other external drivers.\n\n217\n00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.850\nMaybe, quite simply,\nthat our external service providers\n\n218\n00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.770\nwant us to move to a more\ncohesive ecosystem.\n\n219\n00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:29.840\nBecause ITIL can be, if we're\nmanaging multiple service providers,\n\n220\n00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.750\nITIL, it might not help us\nto manage that complexity.\n\n221\n00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:39.588\nAnd so It may well be our service\nproviders that are pushing us to move to\n\n222\n00:13:39.588 --> 00:13:40.738\nthe ecosystem.\n\n223\n00:13:40.738 --> 00:13:43.045\nAnd then we've also got\ncommercial drivers.\n\n224\n00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:46.530\nAnd commercial drivers,\nour last driver type, commercial\n\n225\n00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.920\ndrivers are the drivers that look at\nsort of time to market for our products.\n\n226\n00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.430\nThe fact that we want to be first market.\n\n227\n00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:54.730\nWe wanna beat the competition.\n\n228\n00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.882\nMaybe there's been some benchmarking done.\n\n229\n00:13:58.882 --> 00:14:02.633\nAnd a benchmark is a comparison against,\nperhaps, the industry norm or\n\n230\n00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:05.040\ncomparison against the competitor.\n\n231\n00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.790\nAnd we've done some benchmarking.\n\n232\n00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:10.570\nAnd we've realized that we're not actually\nas competitive as we thought we were, or\n\n233\n00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:15.470\nmaybe we're no longer number one in\nthe world in our industry sector.\n\n234\n00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:20.970\nSo we want to improve, and that would\nbe what we call a commercial driver.\n\n235\n00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.040\nSo the first type of driver\nthat we really want to look at\n\n236\n00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.950\nis our service satisfaction.\n\n237\n00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.900\nAnd service satisfaction is all about\n\n238\n00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:35.220\nthe level of satisfaction that our\ncustomers have with the services.\n\n239\n00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.078\nAnd we've got a graphic here, and\n\n240\n00:14:37.078 --> 00:14:40.227\nthat graphic just simply looks\nat the different factors.\n\n241\n00:14:40.227 --> 00:14:44.002\nAnd I wonder if we can put that up on\nfull screen for us, look at that, see.\n\n242\n00:14:44.002 --> 00:14:45.900\nOur director, she's absolutely amazing.\n\n243\n00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.800\nShe just gets there before\nI've even finish my sentence.\n\n244\n00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:57.060\nSo these are what we call the factors\nrelating to customer satisfaction.\n\n245\n00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.330\nSo things like,\nwe think of the obvious one, and\n\n246\n00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:04.690\nthe obvious one being service performance,\nbut it's not always about performance.\n\n247\n00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.420\nIt's about perception.\n\n248\n00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.050\nIt's perception of satisfaction.\n\n249\n00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:13.360\nSo maybe the service provider\ninteraction is not so great.\n\n250\n00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:19.200\nAnd I use this, and I know that I'm gonna\ntalk about this in a little while, and\n\n251\n00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.195\nwe can reduce the size of\nthat if we want to there.\n\n252\n00:15:22.195 --> 00:15:24.680\nLook it, see, she's wonderful.\n\n253\n00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.947\nService provider interactions,\nI always look at the service\n\n254\n00:15:29.947 --> 00:15:34.923\ndesk as being the weather vane\nof customer satisfaction.\n\n255\n00:15:34.923 --> 00:15:37.388\nAnd there's a reason for this,\n\n256\n00:15:37.388 --> 00:15:42.590\nbecause the service desk is the single\npoint of contact between IT,\n\n257\n00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:48.086\nthe IT service provider and\nwhat happens within IT, and the customer.\n\n258\n00:15:48.086 --> 00:15:51.600\nThe customer doesn't see that we've\ngot 15 different service providers.\n\n259\n00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.564\nThe customer doesn't see that.\n\n260\n00:15:52.564 --> 00:15:55.017\nThey don't need to see that, necessarily.\n\n261\n00:15:55.017 --> 00:15:58.804\nAnd when a user calls the service desk,\nthey're calling one person.\n\n262\n00:15:58.804 --> 00:16:00.520\nThey're calling one number.\n\n263\n00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.440\nAnd a good service desk can\n\n264\n00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:09.400\nmask any amount of chaos that might\nbe going on in the background.\n\n265\n00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.200\nBut a bad service desk, well, it can\naffect the perception of the whole of IT.\n\n266\n00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.000\nNow, I'm gonna ask Justin a question now.\n\n267\n00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.848\nAnd I'll be interested\nin what he's got to say.\n\n268\n00:16:20.848 --> 00:16:25.824\nBecause traditionally,\nwhenever this question is asked of users,\n\n269\n00:16:25.824 --> 00:16:31.890\nusers will give a completely different\nanswer to what IT people give.\n\n270\n00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:39.168\nSo, Justin, I want to see what side of the\nIt's not right or wrong, by the way, okay?\n\n271\n00:16:39.168 --> 00:16:43.897\nSo if you call a service desk and\nyou've got a choice of two people\n\n272\n00:16:43.897 --> 00:16:48.190\nthat you can speak to,\nyou can either speak to grumpy Bob.\n\n273\n00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:53.709\nAnd by the way I don't know any grumpy\nBob but we like to call him grumpy Bob.\n\n274\n00:16:53.709 --> 00:16:56.700\nSo there's grumpy Bob, okay?\n\n275\n00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.660\nNot very happy.\n\n276\n00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.080\nCan be quite rude.\n\n277\n00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.960\nA little bit brusque, a little bit blunt.\n\n278\n00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.040\nBut he gets the job done.\n\n279\n00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:11.702\nWould you rather speak to Grumpy Bob,\nor Cheery Mike?\n\n280\n00:17:11.702 --> 00:17:16.199\nAnd Cheery Mike, really,\nreally friendly guy, very chatty.\n\n281\n00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:18.860\nHe'll build a relationship with you.\n\n282\n00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:22.960\nHe's not gonna get the job done\nas quickly as Grumpy Bob will.\n\n283\n00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.750\nAnd he's gonna have to\nrefer it somebody else.\n\n284\n00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:29.020\nBut his word is his bond, and\nwhat he says will happen.\n\n285\n00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.810\nHe will get back to you.\n\n286\n00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:32.200\nWho would you rather speak to?\n\n287\n00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.826\nWould you rather speak to Bob or\nwould you rather speak to Mike?\n\n288\n00:17:35.826 --> 00:17:38.347\n&gt;&gt; So this is where it.\n\n289\n00:17:38.347 --> 00:17:40.660\nI think sometimes this is very moodal for\nme.\n\n290\n00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.290\nBecause if I'm like,\n\n291\n00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:47.870\nI need to get something done, I'll take\nthe brunt of Bob to get things done.\n\n292\n00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:51.570\nBut in general, when I've spoken to\npeople, maybe it's not necessarily IT,\n\n293\n00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.260\nwhen I'm talking to customer service.\n\n294\n00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:59.430\nAs being someone who has been in\ncustomer service, I like pleasant\n\n295\n00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:04.397\ninteractions because it affects how I\nperceive that organization as a whole.\n\n296\n00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.001\nI know I worked with people at\ncustomer service that were grumpy.\n\n297\n00:18:09.001 --> 00:18:12.299\nAnd you gotta cut that out\nbecause when people call us,\n\n298\n00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:16.182\nwe are the face of the interaction for\nthis respective company.\n\n299\n00:18:16.182 --> 00:18:19.761\nAnd that reflects on our a company,\ntherefore, coming back on us.\n\n300\n00:18:19.761 --> 00:18:24.941\nSo, in general, I like to have a pleasant\nexperience unless I have that one thing\n\n301\n00:18:24.941 --> 00:18:29.756\nwhere I'm like Grumpy Bob, he's\na little blunt, and a little abrasive.\n\n302\n00:18:29.756 --> 00:18:31.956\nBut he's gonna get it done, and\nI need to get it done now, so\n\n303\n00:18:31.956 --> 00:18:34.040\nI'll just take the hit.\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's funny.\n\n304\n00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.710\nAnd the reason why I asked\nthe question is because IT\n\n305\n00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.600\npeople generally turn around and\nsay I'll talk to Grumpy Bob.\n\n306\n00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.050\nI'm fine, I'll talk to him.\n\n307\n00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:41.890\nHe knows his stuff.\n\n308\n00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.870\nHe's gonna get it done, and\nI can talk to him in his language.\n\n309\n00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:49.728\nWhereas users would rather talk to Cheery\nMike because they'd rather have that\n\n310\n00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:51.258\npersonal interaction.\n\n311\n00:18:51.258 --> 00:18:54.866\nBut, as you said, Mike is the face of IT.\n\n312\n00:18:54.866 --> 00:18:58.900\nAnd so I expect Mike to be pleasant,\nand I expect him to be cheery.\n\n313\n00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:03.630\nAnd as long as there's the assurance\nthere that Mike's gonna get the job done,\n\n314\n00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.230\nthen the users, new customers,\nwould rather talk to Mike.\n\n315\n00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.206\nAnd so, you're quite typical.\n\n316\n00:19:09.206 --> 00:19:11.620\nMost IT people would rather talk to Bob.\n\n317\n00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.900\nThey're quite happy talking to Bob.\n\n318\n00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.550\nBut most customers and\nmost users would rather talk to Mike.\n\n319\n00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:23.200\nAnd so when we talk about service provider\ninteractions, that's exactly what we mean.\n\n320\n00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.930\nIf our users and our customers are unhappy\nwith our service provider interactions,\n\n321\n00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.660\nif they're unhappy with the fact\nthat they called the service desk.\n\n322\n00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.470\nAnd when they call the service desk\nthey get Grumpy Bob all the time,\n\n323\n00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:38.630\nthen that is really gonna drive them.\n\n324\n00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.760\nThat's really going to say, you know what?\n\n325\n00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.240\nI want to do something different.\n\n326\n00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.140\nI want to move to somebody else.\n\n327\n00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.350\nYou're thinking there, Justin.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n328\n00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:51.210\nI'm thinking because we've\nlooked at these two extremes.\n\n329\n00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.960\nThey both get the job done.\n\n330\n00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.770\nThe dynamic changes a little\nbit if I have Happy Howard,\n\n331\n00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.050\nwho is still cheery like Cheery Mike, but\n\n332\n00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.840\nhe doesn't actually get the job done.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n333\n00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.206\n&gt;&gt; Because then that can also affect\n\n334\n00:20:03.206 --> 00:20:03.991\nperception.\n\n335\n00:20:03.991 --> 00:20:07.379\nWell, that was a great interaction on the\nphone, but I had to call back six times-\n\n336\n00:20:07.379 --> 00:20:07.902\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n337\n00:20:07.902 --> 00:20:09.269\n&gt;&gt; To actually have something happen,\n\n338\n00:20:09.269 --> 00:20:11.370\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n339\n00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.830\nAnd that takes it to the complete\nother extreme, as well.\n\n340\n00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:18.380\nIn the Happy Howard, bless him,\n\n341\n00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.750\nhe doesn't necessarily have the skills\nto be able to get the job done.\n\n342\n00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.960\nWe used to have a commercial a long,\n\n343\n00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:29.170\nlong time ago in the UK, and\nit was for a breakdown company.\n\n344\n00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:32.630\nAnd their strapline was always,\nwe know a man who can.\n\n345\n00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:37.780\nAnd it was always based on the fact that\nwe don't expect you to have certain skills\n\n346\n00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.580\nbecause we know somebody\nwho does have those skills.\n\n347\n00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.630\nAnd we will always find the right\nperson with those skills.\n\n348\n00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:45.800\nAnd I like to apply that\nto the service desk.\n\n349\n00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.580\nThe service desk analyst should be able\nto say I can't do this myself, but\n\n350\n00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.120\nI know a man who can.\n\n351\n00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.280\nI know somebody who can deal with this for\nyou.\n\n352\n00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.035\nAnd that's exactly what should happen\nis that it should then be passed on.\n\n353\n00:21:00.035 --> 00:21:03.686\nCheery Mike should be, or\nshould we say Merry Mike?\n\n354\n00:21:03.686 --> 00:21:07.689\n[LAUGH] Merry Mike should be, that means\nsomething completely different in English,\n\n355\n00:21:07.689 --> 00:21:08.920\nby the way, so maybe not.\n\n356\n00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.430\nLet's stick with cheery.\n\n357\n00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:15.090\nHe should be able to pass it on to\nsomebody else and get the job done.\n\n358\n00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.800\nWhereas Happy Howard,\nif he's kind of in a day dream somewhere,\n\n359\n00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.340\nthen yeah,\nhe's not gonna be able to do that.\n\n360\n00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.141\nYou're thinking again,\nJustin, it's worrying.\n\n361\n00:21:23.141 --> 00:21:27.702\nBut these user interactions, if I'm\npassing this on, that should be opaque to\n\n362\n00:21:27.702 --> 00:21:31.323\nthe forward-facing interaction\nwith the customer, right.\n\n363\n00:21:31.323 --> 00:21:36.260\nLet's say that I am, I don't know,\nJolly Justin, and you call me.\n\n364\n00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.610\nI don't know why we use these adjectives.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n365\n00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:39.572\n&gt;&gt; But you call me, and\n\n366\n00:21:39.572 --> 00:21:41.220\nI don't know how to do something.\n\n367\n00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:46.222\nI'm guessing I should assure the customer,\nfor\n\n368\n00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:50.861\nthe sake of being satisfied in\nan appropriate user interaction,.\n\n369\n00:21:50.861 --> 00:21:54.441\nShould I be transparent about saying\nI don't know how to do this, but\n\n370\n00:21:54.441 --> 00:21:55.685\nI know someone who can?\n\n371\n00:21:55.685 --> 00:21:59.283\nAnd then I'll take care of it for\nyou, and I'll contact you back?\n\n372\n00:21:59.283 --> 00:22:02.042\nIs that an appropriate interaction, or\nis that a little beyond the scope of what\n\n373\n00:22:02.042 --> 00:22:03.301\nwe're talking about here.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n374\n00:22:03.301 --> 00:22:05.510\nit's kind of beyond the scope\nof what we're talking about.\n\n375\n00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.850\nBut the answer to that is,\nabsolutely, we should be transparent.\n\n376\n00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:12.150\nWe should not be hiding anything.\n\n377\n00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.800\nThis is where we lose\nour credibility as IT.\n\n378\n00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.963\nWe lose our credibility when we don't,\n\n379\n00:22:17.963 --> 00:22:22.160\nwhen we try to be,\nwhat's the word I'm looking for?\n\n380\n00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.450\nI was gonna say subversive, but\nthat's not necessarily the right word.\n\n381\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.610\nWe don't wanna be deceptive, okay.\n\n382\n00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.460\nYou don't necessarily want to\nrun around screaming that hey,\n\n383\n00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:32.862\nI don't know anything, [LAUGH].\n\n384\n00:22:32.862 --> 00:22:36.606\nBut at the same time,\nwe wanna be transparent.\n\n385\n00:22:36.606 --> 00:22:41.997\nWe want to say to our customers, hey,\nlook, this is not my area of expertise.\n\n386\n00:22:41.997 --> 00:22:44.540\nI'm gonna get somebody else\nto look into it for you.\n\n387\n00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:48.610\nAnd once the customer has got that\nassurance, and that's the key.\n\n388\n00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.490\nIt's the assurance that somebody\nis gonna be dealing with this.\n\n389\n00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.610\nAnd that they are going\nto be calling back.\n\n390\n00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.020\nThen we'll be okay.\n\n391\n00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:01.400\nBut if like Happy Howard then you\n\n392\n00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:05.260\ndon't give the customer that assurance,\nand you don't live up to your word,\n\n393\n00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:11.498\nthat's when you start looking and\nevaluating the transparency.\n\n394\n00:23:11.498 --> 00:23:15.240\nAnd that's when we start bringing\nin practices that are really\n\n395\n00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.100\nkind of underhand.\n\n396\n00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:21.600\nWhere we try and hide it from the customer\nthat we're doing something else with that\n\n397\n00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.410\nparticular incident or\nthat particular call\n\n398\n00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.260\nbecause we don't wanna tell them\nit's been passed to somebody else.\n\n399\n00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.440\nCuz the minute we tell them that,\nthey start worrying.\n\n400\n00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.770\nSo we'd always advocate for transparency.\n\n401\n00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.229\nHowever, you've gotta follow it through.\n\n402\n00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.810\nSo let's take a look, then,\nat other sort of drivers, or\n\n403\n00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:47.562\nsub drivers, or\nfactors relating to service satisfaction.\n\n404\n00:23:47.562 --> 00:23:51.146\nSo we've got clarity of roles and\nresponsibilities here.\n\n405\n00:23:51.146 --> 00:23:55.379\nIt goes back to what we were\njust saying actually, Justin.\n\n406\n00:23:55.379 --> 00:24:01.278\nWe want to promote transparency,\nbut if our roles Are not clear.\n\n407\n00:24:01.278 --> 00:24:05.875\nIf Happy Howard simply couldn't get the\njob done because he doesn't know who to\n\n408\n00:24:05.875 --> 00:24:10.675\npass the job to, he doesn't know who to\npass that call to, then actually we're not\n\n409\n00:24:10.675 --> 00:24:15.754\ngonna be providing customer satisfaction,\nand sometimes it's not Howard's fault,\n\n410\n00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:19.525\nsometimes it is the fact that he\njust doesn't know what to do, and\n\n411\n00:24:19.525 --> 00:24:22.890\nmaybe he hasn't been given\nthe right level of training.\n\n412\n00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:27.787\nOr maybe it's just that the paperwork\nthat he's got behind him,\n\n413\n00:24:27.787 --> 00:24:32.594\nall of the FAQs etc., and\nhis org charts are just not up to date,\n\n414\n00:24:32.594 --> 00:24:36.688\nthat could be that audit trail\nmight just not be there.\n\n415\n00:24:36.688 --> 00:24:39.805\nAnd so that could be a factor behind that.\n\n416\n00:24:39.805 --> 00:24:44.613\nWhatever it is, if we don't have\nthat clarity of rolls If Howard\n\n417\n00:24:44.613 --> 00:24:49.748\ndoesn't know who to refer to,\nthen we've got a serious problem there.\n\n418\n00:24:49.748 --> 00:24:53.283\nAnd then we've also got\nthis slow pace of change.\n\n419\n00:24:53.283 --> 00:24:58.754\nAnd in terms of slow pace of change,\nI mentioned it in a previous\n\n420\n00:24:58.754 --> 00:25:04.192\nepisode that we've got to be aligned\nwith the needs of the organization.\n\n421\n00:25:04.192 --> 00:25:09.156\norganization, and to be aligned with the\nneeds of the organization means that we\n\n422\n00:25:09.156 --> 00:25:13.031\nhave got to respond to the changing\nneeds of the organization.\n\n423\n00:25:13.031 --> 00:25:17.424\nThe business, and I know I've said\nthis in the previous episodes,\n\n424\n00:25:17.424 --> 00:25:22.434\nthe business does not come to us to ask\nus for permission to change direction,\n\n425\n00:25:22.434 --> 00:25:26.444\nor to purchase lor acquire\nanother another organization, or\n\n426\n00:25:26.444 --> 00:25:31.146\nto merge with another company, but\nwe still have to respond to that, and\n\n427\n00:25:31.146 --> 00:25:35.463\nif we're not able to respond to\nthat in an appropriate timeframe,\n\n428\n00:25:35.463 --> 00:25:39.591\nthen that's when the business\nstart looking somewhere else.\n\n429\n00:25:39.591 --> 00:25:43.027\nYou're thinking again.\n&gt;&gt; I am thinking again, and\n\n430\n00:25:43.027 --> 00:25:47.162\nthe slow pace of change you said,\nin an appropriate amount of time.\n\n431\n00:25:47.162 --> 00:25:51.940\nI'm guessing that's something that you\nwould decide upon during contracts or\n\n432\n00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.160\nthings like that.\n\n433\n00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.640\nWhat is an appropriate amount of time\nif a business makes a change, or\n\n434\n00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:02.380\nis that one of those things where you\ndon't wanna nail that down too much,\n\n435\n00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.460\ncuz I've been in organizations where,\nwe need to make this change.\n\n436\n00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:09.870\nCan you get it done now, and I think\nthat's an unrealistic expectation, but\n\n437\n00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:14.930\nI think a similar unrealistic\nexpectation is, six months from now,\n\n438\n00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:17.660\ndo you nail that down\nduring the interactions,\n\n439\n00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:22.660\nlike when you set up the actual\nservice provider, I guess,\n\n440\n00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:27.350\ncontract, or interaction?\n&gt;&gt; Well, what I think that what's happened\n\n441\n00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:31.125\nis, you see, Justin and I talk sometimes\nin between episodes, sometimes we do.\n\n442\n00:26:31.125 --> 00:26:35.380\nSometimes, we just ignore each other\ncompletely, cuz it's the way we roll.\n\n443\n00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:39.510\nBut we've been talking about this,\nor something similar anyway.\n\n444\n00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.958\nDo you remember these SLAs\nthat we were talking about,\n\n445\n00:26:41.958 --> 00:26:43.950\nthese service level agreements?\n\n446\n00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.720\nAnd just a little while ago,\n\n447\n00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.430\nwe were talking about the difference\nbetween an incident and a problem, and\n\n448\n00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:54.530\nhow important it is to have the service\ndefinition outlined in an SLA.\n\n449\n00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.987\nThis is something else in our\nservice level agreements, and\n\n450\n00:26:57.987 --> 00:27:01.785\ntherefore in our contracts with\nour external service providers.\n\n451\n00:27:01.785 --> 00:27:05.580\nThat we should have targets, and\nwe will have targets outlined for\n\n452\n00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.513\nresponding to incidents, and\ntargets for responding to problems.\n\n453\n00:27:09.513 --> 00:27:12.495\nWe will also have targets for\nresponding to change.\n\n454\n00:27:12.495 --> 00:27:16.980\nNow, invariably it will be depending\non the scale of the change.\n\n455\n00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.740\nand whether that is a project,\nor whether it is actually\n\n456\n00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:25.520\na change to functionality, or whether it's\nsomething that we call a standard change,\n\n457\n00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.370\nwhich is just a simple request,\ncan I have something?\n\n458\n00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.070\nWe should have agreements\nwith our customer, and\n\n459\n00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:38.330\nthose agreements will lay out,\nalthough it'd be in contractual form,\n\n460\n00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:41.850\nbecause it's a contract with\nan external provider, or\n\n461\n00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:46.750\nan SLA with an internal provider,\nbut those agreements will lay out\n\n462\n00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:51.980\nexactly what targets we\nshould be operating under.\n\n463\n00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.960\nI say targets, we call them service\nlevel targets, they are agreed.\n\n464\n00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.160\nSo I wouldn't say that they\nare all not cast in stone,\n\n465\n00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.830\nbecause they're agreed, but never the less\nthey should be flexible enough as well.\n\n466\n00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:08.370\nSo we should be able to,\nit's one of those things,\n\n467\n00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:13.760\nand I know that we were talking a little\nwhile ago, you've got to be specific,\n\n468\n00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.790\nbut at the same time, you can't\naccommodate for absolutely everything,\n\n469\n00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:19.970\ncuz you don't know what's\ngonna happen in the future.\n\n470\n00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:24.010\nSo once you've gotta be specific you've\nalso got to be ambiguous enough to\n\n471\n00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:28.580\naccommodate for anything outside of\nthe norm, and outside of those parameters.\n\n472\n00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.858\nBut yes, it should be something that's\nproactive that we should think about.\n\n473\n00:28:32.858 --> 00:28:36.310\nSo what others factors\ndo we have then here?\n\n474\n00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.140\nWe've got another three\nat the bottom here.\n\n475\n00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:44.086\nWe're talking about demonstration of\nvalue here, and again, satisfaction.\n\n476\n00:28:44.086 --> 00:28:47.200\nValue is perceived.\n\n477\n00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:51.974\nThat leaves us with a challenge\nas service providers,\n\n478\n00:28:51.974 --> 00:28:56.660\nand as a service integrator,\nor just IT as a general.\n\n479\n00:28:58.150 --> 00:28:59.660\nValue is perceived.\n\n480\n00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.590\nSo Justin, I'm gonna ask you\na question right now, okay,\n\n481\n00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.940\nthis is completely IT unrelated.\n\n482\n00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:09.830\nSo a service is defined as,\nan ideal service definition, a service is\n\n483\n00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:14.830\ndefined as a means of delivering value\nby facilitating the outcomes that\n\n484\n00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:19.840\ncustomers want to achieve without the\nownership of specific costs and risks, so\n\n485\n00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.930\nit's always about facilitating an outcome.\n\n486\n00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.260\nSo we're gonna give you the ability\nto send and receive email.\n\n487\n00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.554\nWe're not gonna type the email for you,\nbut we're gonna give you an ability, and\n\n488\n00:29:30.554 --> 00:29:33.754\nof course, the service is made up of\nthose components, software, hardware,\n\n489\n00:29:33.754 --> 00:29:36.275\nenvironment, people,\ninfrastructure, documentation.\n\n490\n00:29:37.678 --> 00:29:41.098\nSo the outcome that we want to facilitate,\n\n491\n00:29:41.098 --> 00:29:46.140\ncompletely non-IT related,\nis the ability to get from A to B.\n\n492\n00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:52.056\nSo if I tell you,\nyou've got to get from A to B,\n\n493\n00:29:52.056 --> 00:29:57.993\nwhat would your preferred method be?\n&gt;&gt; Are we talking distance?\n\n494\n00:29:57.993 --> 00:30:03.014\nI'm driving across town or like-\n&gt;&gt; Well you just\n\n495\n00:30:03.014 --> 00:30:08.340\nneed to get from A to B so.\n&gt;&gt; As fast as possible?\n\n496\n00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:14.470\nThis is one of those abstract things.-\n&gt;&gt; Just completely abstract.\n\n497\n00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:15.900\nLet's narrow it down slightly.\n\n498\n00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.493\nIf you were gonna go and\nbuy a car tomorrow,\n\n499\n00:30:18.493 --> 00:30:21.157\nwhat car would you buy?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\n\n500\n00:30:21.157 --> 00:30:23.463\nI'd probably buy a Corvette.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n501\n00:30:23.463 --> 00:30:25.696\nyou'd go and buy a Corvette.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n502\n00:30:25.696 --> 00:30:26.344\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but\n\n503\n00:30:26.344 --> 00:30:30.809\nthe outcome that I gave you that you had\nto facilitate was the ability to get\n\n504\n00:30:30.809 --> 00:30:32.177\nfrom A to B.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n505\n00:30:32.177 --> 00:30:35.604\nwhy did you buy a Corvette?\n&gt;&gt; Because I can go fast.\n\n506\n00:30:35.604 --> 00:30:38.212\n&gt;&gt; Right, so based on your preferences,\n\n507\n00:30:38.212 --> 00:30:39.720\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n508\n00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.396\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now if I was gonna buy a car, and\n\n509\n00:30:42.396 --> 00:30:46.997\nI wanted to get from A to B,\nyeah you see, the problem is I'd go and\n\n510\n00:30:46.997 --> 00:30:49.719\nbuy a Camaro right now [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n511\n00:30:49.719 --> 00:30:52.332\n&gt;&gt; The ironic thing about this is that\n\n512\n00:30:52.332 --> 00:30:55.033\nwe both drive trucks.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n513\n00:30:55.033 --> 00:30:57.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But anyway,\n\n514\n00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:01.862\nwe both have a hankering for\nsomething a bit faster, but we've\n\n515\n00:31:01.862 --> 00:31:07.099\nboth got different preferences, and\nyet it facilitates the same outcome.\n\n516\n00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:14.500\nThis means that a service is a means of\ndelivering value by facilitating outcomes.\n\n517\n00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:18.050\nThis means that a customer,\nwell, we're looking for\n\n518\n00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:23.189\nconsistency in facilitating And\noutcome but we have got to get over\n\n519\n00:31:23.189 --> 00:31:28.577\nthe fact that customers perceive\nvalue in different ways.\n\n520\n00:31:28.577 --> 00:31:33.746\nSo, we have got to basically\ngive them a one sized fits all\n\n521\n00:31:33.746 --> 00:31:38.730\nsolution that will satisfy\nall of their preferences.\n\n522\n00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.733\n[SOUND] I've just blown his mind\nright now and I'm not too sure why.\n\n523\n00:31:42.733 --> 00:31:43.234\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n524\n00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:47.236\nFor some reason, I'm thinking of\na core bet with like a lift kid and\n\n525\n00:31:47.236 --> 00:31:50.025\nlike big mutton tyres or\nsomething like that.\n\n526\n00:31:50.025 --> 00:31:52.745\nI'm like,\nI've never seen something reasonable.\n\n527\n00:31:52.745 --> 00:31:57.532\nBut when we're talking about perception,\nwe can shape people's perceptions\n\n528\n00:31:57.532 --> 00:32:00.239\nbased on On a variety of factors, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n529\n00:32:00.239 --> 00:32:03.003\nyou can.\n&gt;&gt; The perceived speed is how fast do I\n\n530\n00:32:03.003 --> 00:32:04.443\ncontact you again.\n\n531\n00:32:04.443 --> 00:32:09.377\nMaybe it didn't actually take any longer,\nbut my point of contact was faster, so\n\n532\n00:32:09.377 --> 00:32:13.623\nyou perceive me to be faster in case.\n&gt;&gt; We can, if we were to, see,\n\n533\n00:32:13.623 --> 00:32:17.660\nI was really ambiguous, and I said,\nif you were to go and get a car,\n\n534\n00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.123\nwhat car would you get?\n\n535\n00:32:19.123 --> 00:32:22.372\nNow, if I turned around to you and\nsaid, okay,\n\n536\n00:32:22.372 --> 00:32:25.217\nnow I'm going to give you a Toyota Prius,\n\n537\n00:32:25.217 --> 00:32:30.276\nwould you perceive value in that?\n&gt;&gt; All day long, because I would find,\n\n538\n00:32:30.276 --> 00:32:34.618\nI get, it's a free car,\nI get better gas mileage, right?\n\n539\n00:32:34.618 --> 00:32:36.769\nIt's brand-new.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n540\n00:32:36.769 --> 00:32:38.261\n&gt;&gt; Cool, yeah.\n\n541\n00:32:38.261 --> 00:32:40.292\n&gt;&gt; So we can shape perception.\n\n542\n00:32:40.292 --> 00:32:43.802\nThat's something interesting\nthat we'll learn,\n\n543\n00:32:43.802 --> 00:32:48.675\nand we'll explore again in another\nepisode, we can shape perception.\n\n544\n00:32:48.675 --> 00:32:51.733\nBut if a customer doesn't\nperceive they're getting value,\n\n545\n00:32:51.733 --> 00:32:54.567\nthen they're going to start looking for\nalternatives.\n\n546\n00:32:54.567 --> 00:32:59.811\nSo again, this is what we call\na factor in customer satisfaction.\n\n547\n00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:03.514\nNow, the last two factors\nin customer satisfaction,\n\n548\n00:33:03.514 --> 00:33:08.032\nthe first one talks about\ncollaboration with service providers.\n\n549\n00:33:08.032 --> 00:33:14.092\nTrust me, if I call up the service\ndesk and I have spoken to cheery Mike,\n\n550\n00:33:14.092 --> 00:33:17.736\nand Mike has passed it\non to somebody else.\n\n551\n00:33:17.736 --> 00:33:19.295\nAnd they then have passed it on\nto another service provider,\n\n552\n00:33:19.295 --> 00:33:20.591\nwho's passed it on to\nanother service provider.\n\n553\n00:33:20.591 --> 00:33:23.690\nWho's passed it on to\nanother service provider,\n\n554\n00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:27.990\nby the time that I have seen 15\ndifferent updates in that incident.\n\n555\n00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:32.392\nAnd not one of them has actually\nmanaged to resolve my incident,\n\n556\n00:33:32.392 --> 00:33:34.522\nI'm annoyed, I'm annoyed.\n\n557\n00:33:34.522 --> 00:33:38.554\nSo if I don't see that collaboration\nbetween my service providers,\n\n558\n00:33:38.554 --> 00:33:40.159\nI'm going to get annoyed.\n\n559\n00:33:40.159 --> 00:33:45.013\nAnd that is going to drive me to,\nwell, insist as a customer that IT\n\n560\n00:33:45.013 --> 00:33:50.334\nchanges the way they do things, and\nit's the same with delivery silos.\n\n561\n00:33:50.334 --> 00:33:55.443\nThis is very, very similar, and\na delivery silo is where we've got our\n\n562\n00:33:55.443 --> 00:34:00.571\nservice providers and they're\nworking independently of each other.\n\n563\n00:34:00.571 --> 00:34:05.763\nAnd certain components of our\nservices are delivered separately,\n\n564\n00:34:05.763 --> 00:34:09.323\nthey're delivered in silos, I don't care.\n\n565\n00:34:09.323 --> 00:34:13.934\nI'm a customer and\nI don't care how the service provider\n\n566\n00:34:13.934 --> 00:34:17.792\ndelivers my service as\nlong as I get my service.\n\n567\n00:34:17.792 --> 00:34:20.074\nAnd I don't want to get\nmy service in pieces.\n\n568\n00:34:20.074 --> 00:34:22.469\nI don't want to get\nfour tires one week and\n\n569\n00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:25.223\nthen I'll get the chassis\nof the car next week.\n\n570\n00:34:25.223 --> 00:34:29.161\nAnd then the week after that,\nthey're going to deliver a steering wheel.\n\n571\n00:34:29.161 --> 00:34:32.868\nNo, that's not how you collect a car,\nyou go and\n\n572\n00:34:32.868 --> 00:34:36.595\nyou collect the car from the sales room,\nright?\n\n573\n00:34:36.595 --> 00:34:41.167\nWell, I do anyway, I don't know about you.\n&gt;&gt; Well, there are some cars that they\n\n574\n00:34:41.167 --> 00:34:45.773\ncome as kit cars because they have to\ncome disassembled because of legality.\n\n575\n00:34:45.773 --> 00:34:46.707\n&gt;&gt; They don't trust you [LAUGH].\n\n576\n00:34:46.707 --> 00:34:48.881\n&gt;&gt; I know, but they're fast but\n\n577\n00:34:48.881 --> 00:34:53.493\nthey're not actually legal unless\nyou assemble them on site.\n\n578\n00:34:53.493 --> 00:34:54.897\n&gt;&gt; It depends what country you're in.\n\n579\n00:34:54.897 --> 00:34:55.921\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I'm talking in\n\n580\n00:34:55.921 --> 00:34:57.421\nthe United States.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n581\n00:34:57.421 --> 00:34:59.103\n&gt;&gt; Because the cars that I'm looking at\n\n582\n00:34:59.103 --> 00:35:02.550\nare typically legal otherwise.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't think I want to know.\n\n583\n00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.903\n&gt;&gt; But in general, I jest.\n\n584\n00:35:04.903 --> 00:35:08.048\nIn general, when we ask for\na car, I want to go,\n\n585\n00:35:08.048 --> 00:35:12.879\nI want to purchase the vehicle and\nthen I get the entirety of the vehicle.\n\n586\n00:35:12.879 --> 00:35:15.140\nI don't want, if they're like,\nall right, so listen,\n\n587\n00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:17.234\nwe got the engine on hand today.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n588\n00:35:17.234 --> 00:35:18.489\n&gt;&gt; You come back next week,\n\n589\n00:35:18.489 --> 00:35:20.559\nwe've got a left door for you.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n590\n00:35:20.559 --> 00:35:21.781\n&gt;&gt; It's going to be amazing.\n\n591\n00:35:21.781 --> 00:35:23.036\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's exactly what\n\n592\n00:35:23.036 --> 00:35:23.694\nwe don't want.\n\n593\n00:35:23.694 --> 00:35:28.260\nAnd this is another reason why customers\nwill want to move from the traditional\n\n594\n00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:29.999\nservice provider approach.\n\n595\n00:35:29.999 --> 00:35:34.484\nOr will want to move into that traditional\nmanagement of a service provider,\n\n596\n00:35:34.484 --> 00:35:35.453\nwe want to move.\n\n597\n00:35:35.453 --> 00:35:38.593\nAnd we want to evolve into\nthe SIAM ecosystem because,\n\n598\n00:35:38.593 --> 00:35:41.473\nquite simply,\nwe've got those delivery silos.\n\n599\n00:35:41.473 --> 00:35:44.331\nBecause the last thing you want to\nhear when you go and buy your car is,\n\n600\n00:35:44.331 --> 00:35:46.123\nwell, that comes from one manufacturer.\n\n601\n00:35:46.123 --> 00:35:48.447\nAnd that comes from another manufacturer,\n\n602\n00:35:48.447 --> 00:35:52.166\nand they're all going to come at\ndifferent times, it doesn't help.\n\n603\n00:35:52.166 --> 00:35:57.997\nSo, what we've looked at in this\nparticular, with just that one slide.\n\n604\n00:35:57.997 --> 00:36:02.392\nAnd we do have downloadable\ninformation available for you,\n\n605\n00:36:02.392 --> 00:36:07.405\nby the way, that accompanies this series,\naccompanies this show.\n\n606\n00:36:07.405 --> 00:36:12.025\nSo please download this and\nyou'll find that this has been expanded\n\n607\n00:36:12.025 --> 00:36:16.172\nhugely in our slide material,\nour downloadable material.\n\n608\n00:36:16.172 --> 00:36:19.306\nBut what we've really looked at\nright now is that first driver and\n\n609\n00:36:19.306 --> 00:36:21.656\nthat's that driver of\ncustomer satisfaction.\n\n610\n00:36:21.656 --> 00:36:26.151\nAnd as far as customer satisfaction,\nservice satisfaction,\n\n611\n00:36:26.151 --> 00:36:30.494\nis concerned, we have to\nremember that value is perceived.\n\n612\n00:36:30.494 --> 00:36:34.673\nAnd if your customer doesn't perceive\nvalue in what you're delivering,\n\n613\n00:36:34.673 --> 00:36:38.002\nthen quite frankly,\nthey're going to go somewhere else.\n\n614\n00:36:38.002 --> 00:36:40.205\nSo please join us again.\n\n615\n00:36:40.205 --> 00:36:42.697\nBecause in our next episode,\n\n616\n00:36:42.697 --> 00:36:48.277\nwe are going to look in more detail\nat the rest of our five drivers for\n\n617\n00:36:48.277 --> 00:36:51.945\nmoving to the SIAM ecosystem.\n&gt;&gt; Well, hopefully,\n\n618\n00:36:51.945 --> 00:36:56.215\nyou've perceived value in this series,\nI know that I'm learning a great deal.\n\n619\n00:36:56.215 --> 00:37:00.885\nSometimes it's a little mind-bending for\nme, but definitely come on back and\n\n620\n00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:02.987\nwell, get a little satisfaction.\n\n621\n00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:06.262\nBut for now, we're going to go ahead and\nget out of here, so signing off for\n\n622\n00:37:06.262 --> 00:37:08.665\nITPRO.TV, I've been your host,\nJustin Dennison.\n\n623\n00:37:08.665 --> 00:37:09.607\n&gt;&gt; And apparently,\n\n624\n00:37:09.607 --> 00:37:14.268\nI'm providing the satisfaction?\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n625\n00:37:14.268 --> 00:37:18.370\nJo Peacock, we'll see you next time.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n626\n00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:23.617\n[MUSIC]\n\n627\n00:37:23.617 --> 00:37:26.986\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching,

00:00:06.754\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:08.259\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:10.434\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings, everyone,\n\n6\n00:00:10.434 --> 00:00:16.170\nand welcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPROTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.166\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n8\n00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:20.331\nAnd we're continuing on with\nSIAM foundation and, well,\n\n9\n00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:23.210\nwe're looking at more service drivers,\nright.\n\n10\n00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.730\nSIAM drivers, excuse me.\n\n11\n00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.910\nI'll tell you what.\n\n12\n00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.360\nThis little miniseries here,\nit's gonna get me.\n\n13\n00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.840\nAnd it might get you as well,\nand who am I talking to?\n\n14\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.249\nWell, the only one that knows\nall about this, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n15\n00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:37.950\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Justin.\n\n16\n00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.460\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, as well.\n\n17\n00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.683\nAnd these drivers, I felt comfortable\ntalking about the satisfaction one.\n\n18\n00:00:47.683 --> 00:00:53.327\nI'm not entirely sure what the landscape,\nthe source landscape, what is that?\n\n19\n00:00:53.327 --> 00:00:55.016\nWhat are we actually\ngonna be talking about?\n\n20\n00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:56.912\n&gt;&gt; Well, what we're talking about in\n\n21\n00:00:56.912 --> 00:01:01.600\nthis particular, and I called this earlier\non a mini-series in our previous episode.\n\n22\n00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.660\nSo it is just a little mini-series\nwhere we're looking at the drivers,\n\n23\n00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.170\nthe reasons behind evolving\nto a SIAM ecosystem.\n\n24\n00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.830\nSo if we look to that previous episode at\n\n25\n00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.110\nthe differences between the ITIL\nmanagement methodology and\n\n26\n00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.880\nthe SIAM ecosystem, and\nwhy we would move to the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n27\n00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.220\nAnd so what we're doing right\nnow is we're in a second, well,\n\n28\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.820\nit's a part two,\nsecond episode in looking at drivers.\n\n29\n00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.021\nWhy we would do this?\n\n30\n00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:37.874\nAnd in our last episode,\nwe looked at service satisfaction,\n\n31\n00:01:37.874 --> 00:01:41.875\ncustomer satisfaction, and\nkeeping our customers happy, and\n\n32\n00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:45.818\nthe fact that customer perception\nis absolutely everything.\n\n33\n00:01:45.818 --> 00:01:49.806\nAnd if our customers are unhappy then\nwe need to do something about it,\n\n34\n00:01:49.806 --> 00:01:51.770\nas IT service providers.\n\n35\n00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.440\nNow, we know, just to do a quick recap,\n\n36\n00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.920\nwe know that we have the three\nlayers in our SIAM ecosystem.\n\n37\n00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.480\nWe have our customer, and everything that\nwe do is to deliver value to our customer.\n\n38\n00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.990\nAnd then underneath that,\nwe have our service integrator layer.\n\n39\n00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.789\nAnd then underneath them then we\nhave our service provider layer.\n\n40\n00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.929\nAnd our service provider layer in an SIAM\necosystem looks at multiple service\n\n41\n00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:20.400\nproviders, be they internal service\nproviders or external service providers.\n\n42\n00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.780\nBut we have multiple service providers.\n\n43\n00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.520\nIn a traditional ITIL\nmanagement methodology,\n\n44\n00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.410\nwe generally have one service provider.\n\n45\n00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.890\nAnd we will have multiple\nvendors that may supply\n\n46\n00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.110\nindividual parts of a service,\nindividual components to a service.\n\n47\n00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.820\nBut here in a SIAM system, we're looking\nat multiple different service providers.\n\n48\n00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.650\nSo we'll have a service provider that\nprovides, maybe, some element of hardware.\n\n49\n00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.910\nWe'll have a service provider that\nprovides some elements of software,\n\n50\n00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.190\nmaybe Software as a Service, for instance.\n\n51\n00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.420\nSo in this particular little mini-series,\nwe're looking at the reasons why\n\n52\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.680\nwe want to move to that particular\nmethodology, to that particular ecosystem.\n\n53\n00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.360\nWe're not looking at the reasons why we\nwant to establish more service providers\n\n54\n00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.450\nbecause, invariably, to move to this SIAM\necosystem, we've already hit that point.\n\n55\n00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.450\nWe've already been out, and\nwe have brought in more service providers.\n\n56\n00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.230\nAnd we've already reached\nthe point where we've realized\n\n57\n00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.980\nthat we've got more service providers,\n\n58\n00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.510\nwe've got more external vendors,\nthan we know how to manage effectively.\n\n59\n00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.230\nWe still have the same principles\nthat we had within ITIL.\n\n60\n00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.270\nWe're still looking at delivering value.\n\n61\n00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.960\nWe're still looking at managing our\nservices efficiently and effectively.\n\n62\n00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.230\nBut that middle layer of the ecosystem,\nthe service integrator, that is the role.\n\n63\n00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.330\nThat's the layer that ensures that we're\ndelivering value to the customer, and\n\n64\n00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.900\nthat we're doing that in an efficient and\nan effective way.\n\n65\n00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.620\nIn other words, they have got the job of\nmanaging all of those service providers.\n\n66\n00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.670\nThey've got the job of\nensuring cohesion and\n\n67\n00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.790\nensuring collaboration between\nall of those service providers.\n\n68\n00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.820\nAnd it's not as simple as it sounds,\nand it sounds quite complex.\n\n69\n00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.800\nSo, yeah, it's not that simple.\n\n70\n00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.750\nSo in order to move to\nthis SIAM way of working,\n\n71\n00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.051\nin order to move to the SIAM\necosystem then, we explored,\n\n72\n00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:37.150\nwell, the first driver,\nwhich was service satisfaction.\n\n73\n00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.330\nAnd now we're gonna be looking\nat another driver, and\n\n74\n00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.110\nthat other driver,\nanother reason for doing this.\n\n75\n00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.860\nRemember organizational\nchange management and\n\n76\n00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.770\nthe fact that we have to\nhave a need to do anything?\n\n77\n00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.130\nWell, here's another need.\n\n78\n00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.120\nAnd we call this our service and\nsourcing landscape.\n\n79\n00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.979\nAnd on the screen in front\nof you right now, you have.\n\n80\n00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.640\nSee, look at that, I'm always amazed,\nabsolutely fantastic.\n\n81\n00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.620\nIt's just there,\nit's like I just imagined it.\n\n82\n00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.950\nOn the screen in front of you right now,\nyou'll see the factors, as we like to call\n\n83\n00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.730\nthem, the factors that will\ninfluence this particular driver.\n\n84\n00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.650\nAnd this is a driver, this is a reason why\nwe want to move to the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n85\n00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.610\nAnd so these are,\nyou might call these sub-reasons,\n\n86\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.400\nthese are the factors that\ninfluence this particular driver.\n\n87\n00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.530\nSo we're just gonna take a look\nat each one of these in turn.\n\n88\n00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.500\nAnd I'm sure that Justin will have some\nquestions, as well, as we move along.\n\n89\n00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.030\nSo let's take a look at the first\none then, external sourcing.\n\n90\n00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.457\nA lot of organizations,\nat some point in time,\n\n91\n00:05:43.457 --> 00:05:48.835\nhave made a decision that they're\ngoing to move to external sourcing\n\n92\n00:05:48.835 --> 00:05:54.698\nbecause their internal IT department\nmaybe doesn't have enough skills.\n\n93\n00:05:54.698 --> 00:05:59.512\nMaybe it has some skills, but they're\nhaving difficulty in maintaining the skill\n\n94\n00:05:59.512 --> 00:06:02.560\nlevel that's required by the business.\n\n95\n00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.860\nPerhaps the business is growing, and\ninternal IT cannot grow as quickly.\n\n96\n00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.780\nMaybe there's been some merger and\nsome acquisition, and\n\n97\n00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.470\nagain internal IT cannot grow as quickly.\n\n98\n00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.690\nOr maybe it's just a cost.\n\n99\n00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.004\nBecause you see, the cost of\ninternal IT can be quite expensive,\n\n100\n00:06:23.004 --> 00:06:27.645\nespecially when you talk about\nbringing in experts in certain areas.\n\n101\n00:06:27.645 --> 00:06:30.310\nYou talk about maintaining\ntheir skill levels.\n\n102\n00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:37.170\nAs well as maintaining skill levels, you\nalso have to maintain the, what's the word\n\n103\n00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.780\nI'm looking for, relevance, updatedness,\nof all of our services, as well.\n\n104\n00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.480\nWe gotta make sure that\nwe're kept up to date.\n\n105\n00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.110\nI guess relevance would be a good word for\n\n106\n00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.990\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; There is a word for that,\n\n107\n00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.135\nI can't think of it either.\n&gt;&gt; There is, right [LAUGH],\n\n108\n00:06:50.135 --> 00:06:50.941\nI know.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, then,\n\n109\n00:06:50.941 --> 00:06:52.445\nya'll know what we're talking about.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n110\n00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:54.326\n&gt;&gt; There's a word that means up-to-date,\n\n111\n00:06:54.326 --> 00:06:56.883\nmost relevant skill sets.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n112\n00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:57.539\n&gt;&gt; My goodness,\n\n113\n00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:58.905\nJo, if you hadn't asked me,\n\n114\n00:06:58.905 --> 00:07:01.820\nI would have been able to tell you.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, right, it's on the tip\n\n115\n00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.500\nof my tongue and I can't think.\n&gt;&gt; But I get what you're saying.\n\n116\n00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.319\nAnd it does seem like that\ncould be a huge issue, right.\n\n117\n00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:12.216\nThe driving force for external\nsourcing is, I almost think of it,\n\n118\n00:07:12.216 --> 00:07:15.100\nas I try to create an example in my head.\n\n119\n00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.020\nIf I only need this one skill\nset that is highly valued\n\n120\n00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.540\nonce a month.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n121\n00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.030\n&gt;&gt; Then why am I acquiring, maintaining,\n\n122\n00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:28.720\ntraining someone, or a group of someones,\nthat have that skill set that I'm\n\n123\n00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.090\nonly using on a periodic basis, right?\n&gt;&gt; A lot of this is down to cost, as well.\n\n124\n00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.990\nAs an organization grows,\n\n125\n00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:40.810\nwe generally find that we'll\nstart off with a small IT team.\n\n126\n00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.270\nAnd they'll have a specific\n\n127\n00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.260\nrange of skills to meet\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n128\n00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.390\nAnd as the organization grows, we're\nsimply not able to expand that quickly.\n\n129\n00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.580\nAnd the cost of bringing in new\npeople with all of the benefits,\n\n130\n00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.347\netc., with bringing in new people, And\n\n131\n00:07:57.347 --> 00:08:01.563\nthat can actually outweigh\nthe benefits to the organization.\n\n132\n00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:04.599\nSo what we might choose to do\nis we might choose to, and\n\n133\n00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:08.650\nwe'll see organizations that\nmove to contract staff.\n\n134\n00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.000\nBut then we see organizations that also\nmove to the software as a service type\n\n135\n00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.510\napproach and that actually say, well\nyou know what, I can't deal with this.\n\n136\n00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:22.136\nAnd I say this quiet often,\nwhen we look at things like office, for\n\n137\n00:08:22.136 --> 00:08:25.930\ninstance, Microsoft Office,\nwe see software as a service more and\n\n138\n00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.400\nmore frequently now with Microsoft Office.\n\n139\n00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:34.450\nAnd in fact, that is something that's even\ncoming down to the individual home use\n\n140\n00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:39.265\nnow as well when moving towards software\nas a service with Microsoft Office.\n\n141\n00:08:39.265 --> 00:08:44.185\nAnd now we don't for a lot of things.\n\n142\n00:08:44.185 --> 00:08:48.784\nAdobe is another one now, I think as well,\nthat's moved to a subscription\n\n143\n00:08:48.784 --> 00:08:53.675\nservice rather than, here I'm gonna\ngive you some software, you install it,\n\n144\n00:08:53.675 --> 00:08:58.530\nand we update it, and we'll send you\nservice patches every now and then.\n\n145\n00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.830\nInstead of that,\neverything's done now in the Cloud,\n\n146\n00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.180\nit's this software as a service.\n\n147\n00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:08.502\nSo this is one of the reasons\nwhy we may want to move towards\n\n148\n00:09:08.502 --> 00:09:12.825\nthe SIAM ecosystem and\nthe SIAM way of managing because,\n\n149\n00:09:12.825 --> 00:09:16.870\nquite simply,\nwe've got software as a service.\n\n150\n00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:23.300\nWe've got more external vendors or\nsuppliers than we had before.\n\n151\n00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.560\nAnd it ties up in other one that\nwe're gonna look at in a second,\n\n152\n00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.890\nwhich is that increase in\nthe number of service providers.\n\n153\n00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:33.105\nBut it's that move towards\nexternal sourcing, and\n\n154\n00:09:33.105 --> 00:09:37.870\nthat's a move that a lot of\norganizations are taking now.\n\n155\n00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:42.130\nWhy do something in-house when it's\ngoing to be half the price and\n\n156\n00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:47.490\nit's going to be supportable if we\nallow somebody else to do it for us?\n\n157\n00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:52.168\nThis is not going to work with what I\nmight call bespoke development work or\n\n158\n00:09:52.168 --> 00:09:54.570\ntailor-made development work.\n\n159\n00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.830\nBut, while I say it's not going to work,\nit will work, but it won't necessarily be\n\n160\n00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.960\ncheaper with bespoke development work,\nbut nevertheless we see that move to\n\n161\n00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.060\nthe external sourcing, and\nthat's something that we've got to manage.\n\n162\n00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.350\nAnd as our number of vendors increases,\n\n163\n00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.510\nthen the complexity of our\nsourcing increases as well.\n\n164\n00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:18.500\nSo again the move to the SIAM\necosystem makes sense.\n\n165\n00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.966\nAnd then we've also got what\nwe call shadow IT, shadow\n\n166\n00:10:23.966 --> 00:10:30.830\nIT exists, well, more frequently than\nmost organizations would care to admit.\n\n167\n00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:35.040\nAnd shadow IT,\nI see Justin looking at me with a sort of\n\n168\n00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.670\na curious expression on his face.\n&gt;&gt; Sorry,\n\n169\n00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:42.500\nwhen you say shadow IT somehow my mind\nwent to people dressed up like ninjas that\n\n170\n00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.210\nare coming over to fix your computers,\nlike they just appear out of the shadows,\n\n171\n00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.890\nlike there it is it's fixed,\nand they disappear.\n\n172\n00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.720\nI know that's not what we're talking\nabout, but I kinda chuckled to myself cuz\n\n173\n00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.590\nthat was the image that came to my head.\n&gt;&gt; Well I mean you know,\n\n174\n00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.750\nwe do have sort of self\nhealing systems nowadays.\n\n175\n00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.330\nI guess so there you go.\n\n176\n00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.780\nIt's just one step further, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n177\n00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n178\n00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think in a more ominous way,\n\n179\n00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:08.198\nif we just had people stepping\nout of the shadows going,\n\n180\n00:11:08.198 --> 00:11:10.190\nalright I'm here to fix your stuff.\n\n181\n00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.730\nLike, where did you come from?\n\n182\n00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.480\nBut that's not what we're talking about.\n\n183\n00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.730\nWhat are we actually talking\nabout with shadow IT?\n\n184\n00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:16.900\n&gt;&gt; No, definitely not.\n\n185\n00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.940\nWhat we're talking about\nis IT that creeps.\n\n186\n00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.878\nWell no, I guess we are sort of.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n187\n00:11:20.878 --> 00:11:22.570\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about IT that creeps\n\n188\n00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.640\nonto our infrastructure.\n\n189\n00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:30.530\nWe're actually talking about business\nhumans that go off on their own and\n\n190\n00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.350\nsource their own IT solution.\n\n191\n00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:37.880\nInvariably, business units go off and\nsource their own IT solution\n\n192\n00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.880\nbecause they feel that\nthey do not perceive value\n\n193\n00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:48.030\nin their internal IT department,\nfor whatever reason.\n\n194\n00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:51.360\nThere's a multitude of reasons,\n1001 reasons.\n\n195\n00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.390\nAnd it could be quite simply, remember\nwhat I said in a previous episode about\n\n196\n00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.530\nthe service desk being the window to IT,\nand\n\n197\n00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:04.900\nthe service desk set perception,\nvalue perception for IT, it could be that.\n\n198\n00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.980\nOr it could be the whenever\nthey've asked for changes,\n\n199\n00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:15.380\nwhenever they've asked for new services\nthat IT hasn't responded quickly enough.\n\n200\n00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:23.730\nThere are a myriad of reasons why business\nunits go direct to external providers.\n\n201\n00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.070\nI've always said throughout my career,\nI have always said that\n\n202\n00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.980\nwe've always got somebody knocking on the\ndoor of our CEO offering to do our job for\n\n203\n00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.740\nless money and to a higher efficiency and\na higher quality than we can.\n\n204\n00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.340\nAnd it is up to us, it's our own personal\nresponsibility to ensure that we can\n\n205\n00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.700\ndeliver the best quality\nservice that we can.\n\n206\n00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.590\nAnd I want to add a little\ncaveat onto that statement,\n\n207\n00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.470\nwhich is the best service or\nthe best quality of service that we can\n\n208\n00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.590\nthat is aligned to the needs\nof the organization.\n\n209\n00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:00.010\nThis is not about what we want to do\nin IT, it's about what the business or\n\n210\n00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.040\nthe organization needs us to do.\n\n211\n00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.260\nIt's not about what we wanna do.\n\n212\n00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:11.870\nAnd quite often, IT, internal IT teams\nlose their vision, they lose their way.\n\n213\n00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:17.100\nAnd we get involved in playing with new\ntoys, we get involved in things that\n\n214\n00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:22.680\nare sort of the minutia of services.\n\n215\n00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.560\nAnd it's not what the business want,\nwhat the business want is for\n\n216\n00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.824\nIT to be relevant.\n\n217\n00:13:27.824 --> 00:13:36.520\nWe're in the 21st century, and in\nthe 21st century, IT evolves so quickly.\n\n218\n00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.630\nWe replace our cell phones every year.\n\n219\n00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.210\nIf you're like me, I mean,\nby the time it is come around,\n\n220\n00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.585\nI'm bored that, I want something new now.\n\n221\n00:13:44.585 --> 00:13:49.640\nSo we replace our cell phones every year,\nand if we replace our technology that\n\n222\n00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.620\nquickly, then you can bet your\nlife on the fact that your\n\n223\n00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:59.140\nbusiness wants to see that\nevolution in IT as well.\n\n224\n00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.390\nThey get that evolution in their personal\nlife, why shouldn't they have that\n\n225\n00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:06.600\nevolution in their work life,\nin their technical life at work.\n\n226\n00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:13.290\nIf internal IT teams are not seen\nto be as responsive as what's\n\n227\n00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:19.560\nout there in the marketplace, then by all\naccounts, the business are going to see\n\n228\n00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:25.270\njustification in going outside of IT, and\nthat's exactly what they're going to do.\n\n229\n00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.500\nSo, we call that shadow IT,\nwhere the business are going and\n\n230\n00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:33.610\nbuying IT that the IT department\ndon't know anything about.\n\n231\n00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.930\nAnd of course that then has\nto sit on our infrastructure.\n\n232\n00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.560\nAnd that can cause a myriad of\nproblems as well on it's own\n\n233\n00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.000\nbecause then they're running to\nthese particular service providers.\n\n234\n00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.850\nThey're now running to\ntheir own upgrade schedule.\n\n235\n00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.800\nThey're running to their\nown maintenance schedules.\n\n236\n00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.890\nAnd they are putting well\nany sort of component on our\n\n237\n00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:58.470\ninfrastructure that may then have\na detrimental effect on other services.\n\n238\n00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.070\nAnd I've seen Justin out\nof the corner of my eye\n\n239\n00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.758\nitching to say something.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n240\n00:15:02.758 --> 00:15:03.850\n&gt;&gt; Literally he's scratching.\n\n241\n00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.860\nI think he's got problems.\n&gt;&gt; Man, I'll tell you what, these spiders.\n\n242\n00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.280\nNo, I'm joking.\n\n243\n00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.280\nBut when a business does that,\nthe shadow IT,\n\n244\n00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:16.200\nif it is driven by the perception\nthat the internal IT team is not\n\n245\n00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.460\nas quick to respond or\nis not growing to the business needs.\n\n246\n00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:25.149\nWhatever that driving factor,\ncan't the shadow IT actually\n\n247\n00:15:25.149 --> 00:15:28.050\nmake that perception worse?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n248\n00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:28.800\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n249\n00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.180\nif that perception is worse,\nthen that drives people to go out.\n\n250\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:36.050\nIt's like this weird negative feedback,\nI guess, positive feedback loop,\n\n251\n00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.440\nwhere, it was bad, so I got something new,\nso then it was worse, so\n\n252\n00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.000\nI got something new again.\n\n253\n00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.515\nAnd there seems to be a very large\nimplication to the business if this\n\n254\n00:15:45.515 --> 00:15:49.086\noccurs, right?\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm gonna say something fairly\n\n255\n00:15:49.086 --> 00:15:53.830\ncontroversial now because I can and\nyou know when we have business units,\n\n256\n00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:58.510\nwe used to have a saying and\nI don't know whether you remember this.\n\n257\n00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:00.400\nYou're nowhere near as old as I am.\n\n258\n00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.640\nBut we used to have a saying in in IT that\na user with a little bit of knowledge can\n\n259\n00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.960\nbe a very dangerous thing.\n\n260\n00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.530\nRight?\n\n261\n00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.180\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure I remember that say but\n\n262\n00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:13.470\nI definitely resonates with me you know\nwere like you said some terms that\n\n263\n00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:18.665\nI recognizes but I'm not sure\nthey mean what you think it is.\n\n264\n00:16:18.665 --> 00:16:19.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n265\n00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:24.230\nwe get some a little bit of power and\nit use to be I'm my day.\n\n266\n00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:28.580\nOkay, going back a few years, you'd give\nthem access maybe to the admin rights on\n\n267\n00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.690\ntheir PC and\nwho knows what you'd find on their PC?\n\n268\n00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.770\nWhatever it is, it was never good.\n\n269\n00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.770\nAnd it's the same kind of mentality.\n\n270\n00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:40.570\nAll right, maybe not so drastic,\nbut potentially it could be.\n\n271\n00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:44.880\nBecause what happens is that people\nthat don't necessarily understand\n\n272\n00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.640\nthe IT Are sold something by a supplier.\n\n273\n00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.890\nAnd they're sold one solution.\n\n274\n00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:55.680\nBut unfortunately, that one solution is\nimplemented on our infrastructure, and\n\n275\n00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.590\nthen actually causes a problem\nwith something else.\n\n276\n00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:04.120\nSo let's say, for\ninstance that a very, very simple one.\n\n277\n00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.730\nAnd by the way,\nI'm gonna use some examples here.\n\n278\n00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.970\nThey're just examples, nothing else,\nthis is not based on personal experience.\n\n279\n00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:16.190\nBut let's say that an organization\nwere to bring in something like SAP.\n\n280\n00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:17.839\nSAP's quite resource hungry.\n\n281\n00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.580\nSAP is a financial application,\na database application.\n\n282\n00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:27.746\nQuite resource hungry in\nterms of our infrastructure.\n\n283\n00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:32.985\nSo a business unit goes out and\ndecides they need some financial or\n\n284\n00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:38.700\nsome database type application and\nthey approach SAP or maybe Oracle,\n\n285\n00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:44.060\nand they bring that particular\nprovider on board or what happens?\n\n286\n00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.852\nEmails suddenly starts slowing down.\n\n287\n00:17:47.124 --> 00:17:50.440\nAnd they can't figure out why\nemails started slowing down.\n\n288\n00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:55.094\nSo they then go, that business unit then\ngoes to or it might be another business\n\n289\n00:17:55.094 --> 00:17:59.830\nunit who are worried about the fact that\nemails suddenly started slowing down.\n\n290\n00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.075\nThey think that they got\nno confidence in IT so\n\n291\n00:18:02.075 --> 00:18:05.040\nthey then go to Microsoft directly and\nsay, you know what?\n\n292\n00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.710\nWe need some resources for\nour email service.\n\n293\n00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.420\nWe know you're providing it.\n\n294\n00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:14.830\nIf we pay some more money,\ncan we get a better service?\n\n295\n00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:18.025\nAnd so they do that, but\nit doesn't give them a better service.\n\n296\n00:18:18.025 --> 00:18:22.895\nEmail is still very slow, and\nwhat Microsoft have done, is they've quite\n\n297\n00:18:22.895 --> 00:18:27.335\nrightly said, okay, you probably need some\nenhanced processing power on your servers.\n\n298\n00:18:27.335 --> 00:18:30.725\nSo they have brought in some enhance\nprocessing power on the servers.\n\n299\n00:18:31.755 --> 00:18:36.155\nAnd what none of them realize is the face\nthat when the financial package was\n\n300\n00:18:36.155 --> 00:18:38.745\nbrought in,\nit used up bandwidth on the network.\n\n301\n00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:45.180\nAnd so that had an impact on\nthe response time from email.\n\n302\n00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:51.390\nAnd so when the business unit then went\nto Microsoft and Microsoft said, right,\n\n303\n00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:53.070\nyou've got a processing problem.\n\n304\n00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.740\nWe'll sell you more servers\nwith better processing power.\n\n305\n00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:00.725\nUnfortunately, what that did was\nin itself-increased lee bandwidth\n\n306\n00:19:00.725 --> 00:19:02.810\nusage on the network.\n\n307\n00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:07.945\nSo what we had is every time that\nwould happen, then you get another\n\n308\n00:19:07.945 --> 00:19:14.140\nresource-hungry solution\nto an original problem.\n\n309\n00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:18.190\nBut the problem is\nthe bandwidth on the network.\n\n310\n00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:23.310\nThe problem has got absolute nothing to do\nwith either one of those applications but\n\n311\n00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.880\nbecause the business\nare going elsewhere for\n\n312\n00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.620\npotential solutions,\nthen they are compounding the issue and\n\n313\n00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:34.790\nwith very solution that's been brought in,\nit’s just making the things worse.\n\n314\n00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.900\nNot to mention the fact that\nit’s making the things worse for\n\n315\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.840\nabsolutely everybody across the board and\nnot just their business unit.\n\n316\n00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.200\nSo yes, you're right where\nwe've got this shadow IT,\n\n317\n00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.040\nwhere we've got the business going out and\nthey are sourcing their own solutions,\n\n318\n00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:55.480\nit can have a severe detrimental impact\non the rest of the organization.\n\n319\n00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:01.960\nAnd so that's a key driver for\nthe SIAM ecosystem is actually\n\n320\n00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:07.990\nhaving business units going out and\nsourcing their own IT.\n\n321\n00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.830\nWe don't expect business\nunits to be IT people.\n\n322\n00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:17.280\nBut we expect them to know enough to be\nable to make strategic decisions, perhaps.\n\n323\n00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:22.130\nAnd that's why they make the strategic\ndecision to go to a supplier.\n\n324\n00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:27.280\nBut unfortunately, what business units\ndon't see is what I hate using cliches,\n\n325\n00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.900\nbut they don't see the big picture.\n\n326\n00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.330\nThey don't understand\nthe entire infrastructure.\n\n327\n00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.740\nAnd without that comprehensive\nunderstanding, there's going to be impact.\n\n328\n00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.720\nThere's gonna be negative impact and\nthere's nothing that we can do to avoid it\n\n329\n00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.150\nwhile business units are going out and\nsourcing on their own.\n\n330\n00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:46.460\nSo yeah, it does have a negative impact.\n\n331\n00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.890\nSo that is quite often a key driver for\n\n332\n00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:54.110\nthe implementation of SIAM,\nthe SIAM ecosystem.\n\n333\n00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:59.800\nIt's managing that multiple\nvendor environment.\n\n334\n00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.110\nBecause we need to have some form\nof cohesive collaboration and\n\n335\n00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:09.740\ncohesive management of that environment\nwhich is why as another driver or\n\n336\n00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:13.500\nanother factor within this driver,\nwe look at multi-sourcing.\n\n337\n00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:19.840\nNow, multi-sourcing quite simply means\nSourcing from more than one supplier.\n\n338\n00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.740\nIt brings in complexity and\n\n339\n00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.140\nthat ties into the increase in\nthe number of service providers.\n\n340\n00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.940\nIt just brings in complexity.\n\n341\n00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.000\nWe have to have cohesion and\nwe have to have consistency in the way,\n\n342\n00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.940\nwe manage our contracts and\nin the way we manage our suppliers.\n\n343\n00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.702\nI see just in the corner of my\neye itching to say something.\n\n344\n00:21:37.702 --> 00:21:39.639\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, apparently,\n\n345\n00:21:39.639 --> 00:21:42.348\nI cannot feign my emotions very well.\n\n346\n00:21:42.348 --> 00:21:43.298\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I cannot.\n\n347\n00:21:43.298 --> 00:21:47.040\nSo this multi-sourcing,\nare we talking about respective\n\n348\n00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.360\nservices that may come from\nmultiple service providers?\n\n349\n00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:56.850\nOr is it just the fact that there\nare multiple service providers in general?\n\n350\n00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:59.113\nBecause I'm looking at Here's\nwhere this question comes\n\n351\n00:21:59.113 --> 00:21:59.855\nfrom.\n&gt;&gt; Go on.\n\n352\n00:21:59.855 --> 00:22:03.845\n&gt;&gt; External sourcing, multi-sourcing,\n\n353\n00:22:03.845 --> 00:22:04.540\nokay.\n\n354\n00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:09.651\nCan you help me determine the delineation\nbetween the two like how should\n\n355\n00:22:09.651 --> 00:22:13.403\nI think about external versus multi?\n&gt;&gt; How should you think about\n\n356\n00:22:13.403 --> 00:22:14.414\nexternal versus multi?\n\n357\n00:22:14.414 --> 00:22:18.961\nWell, multi-sourcing means\nactually bringing in\n\n358\n00:22:18.961 --> 00:22:23.450\nsolutions from various\ndifferent suppliers.\n\n359\n00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:30.070\nAnd it could mean we're bringing in\nthe same solutions to different suppliers.\n\n360\n00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.200\nAnd if you watched one of\nour previous episodes,\n\n361\n00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.640\nyou'll see something about having\nall your eggs in one basket.\n\n362\n00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:42.120\nJustin running across fields carrying\nbaskets of eggs, let's not go there again.\n\n363\n00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:48.250\nIt's about reducing risk so it could be\nthat or it could be the simple fact that\n\n364\n00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:55.050\nwe have got multiple vendors within\nour organization, a multiple supply.\n\n365\n00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:59.990\nBut what we're really referring to\nis the ability to reduce risk by\n\n366\n00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.700\nmaybe having more than one\nhardware manufacturer for our PCs.\n\n367\n00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.380\nSo that if that particular hardware\nmanufacturer maybe changes their model,\n\n368\n00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:14.470\nthen at least we've got one that where\nwe have some stability that we can use.\n\n369\n00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:18.190\nAnd we can deploy those whenever\nsomeone asks for a new PC.\n\n370\n00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:19.670\nWe can do that.\n\n371\n00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:23.290\nWe can use that particular model of PC\nwhile we're working on the build for\n\n372\n00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.500\nthe new model from the other supplier.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n373\n00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.510\nthat's starting to, okay so\nfurther with this hardware, right?\n\n374\n00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:31.820\nI have multiple PCs.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n375\n00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:32.685\n&gt;&gt; Or whatever,\n\n376\n00:23:32.685 --> 00:23:35.510\nmaybe even multiple in house servers.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n377\n00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:36.131\n&gt;&gt; But I'm,\n\n378\n00:23:36.131 --> 00:23:40.823\nthose are all external sources, but I'm\nusing multiple ones to mitigate risk if\n\n379\n00:23:40.823 --> 00:23:44.480\nthere is an unforeseen change\nthat could impact the business.\n\n380\n00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.727\nAm I understanding this correctly?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n381\n00:23:46.727 --> 00:23:48.152\nOkay, all right.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n382\n00:23:48.152 --> 00:23:50.897\n&gt;&gt; Then I'm good, I'm good, Jo.\n\n383\n00:23:50.897 --> 00:23:54.718\nWe can carry on from here, I guess.\n&gt;&gt; No, and I mean years and years ago,\n\n384\n00:23:54.718 --> 00:23:56.810\nwe used to do this with\nour mainframes as well.\n\n385\n00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.050\nWe would bring it.\n\n386\n00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:02.810\nEven though IBM was sort of the big\nmanufacturer for mainframes,\n\n387\n00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.950\nwe'd also use other suppliers like Amdahl,\nfor instance,\n\n388\n00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:09.380\nthat would stop us from having\nall our eggs in one basket.\n\n389\n00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.802\nThat would allow us to mitigate risk so\nthat if there was a failure in some\n\n390\n00:24:13.802 --> 00:24:19.230\nhardware, we'd bring in other hardware\nthat could act as a fail-safe, really.\n\n391\n00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:22.110\nSo we're talking about resilience,\nthat's what we're talking about.\n\n392\n00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:26.350\nWe're talking about resilience, or\nyou might call it redundancy options here.\n\n393\n00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:30.810\nAnd the example that I gave you about\nhaving laptops, that's quite a common one.\n\n394\n00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.720\nWe'll quite often see that\nin our organizations where\n\n395\n00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.905\nwe'll have two different manufacturers for\nour laptops and our desktops.\n\n396\n00:24:38.905 --> 00:24:43.405\nSo that if one manufacturer\ndecides to upgrade and\n\n397\n00:24:43.405 --> 00:24:48.365\nreplace a particular model, we've still\ngot one that we can distribute while we're\n\n398\n00:24:48.365 --> 00:24:52.075\nworking on the build for the new model\nfrom that particular manufacturer.\n\n399\n00:24:52.075 --> 00:24:56.915\nSometimes working on a build for a new\nmodel of laptop is not as easy as just\n\n400\n00:24:56.915 --> 00:25:01.435\ngoing out, buying it off the shelves,\nand then deploying it to somebody.\n\n401\n00:25:01.435 --> 00:25:05.972\nBut if we've gotta work out all of our\napps, and we've also gotta work out all of\n\n402\n00:25:05.972 --> 00:25:10.950\nour security requirements, etc., too, and\npotentially that could be a big thing.\n\n403\n00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:16.430\nSo what about other factors,\nthen, in our driver?\n\n404\n00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:19.430\nWell, we've already mentioned\nthe increase in service providers.\n\n405\n00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:22.500\nThe more service providers that we have,\n\n406\n00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:27.190\nthe less consistency we're going to have\nacross the number of service providers.\n\n407\n00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.150\nThat makes it really difficult to manage.\n\n408\n00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:31.861\nWhen we have got, well,\n\n409\n00:25:31.861 --> 00:25:36.267\nwe've got processes that span\nall of those service providers.\n\n410\n00:25:36.267 --> 00:25:42.116\nIf they're all involved in incident\nmanagement, then how do we ensure that all\n\n411\n00:25:42.116 --> 00:25:48.516\nthe customer sees is the fact that they've\nreported an incident and then it's fixed?\n\n412\n00:25:48.516 --> 00:25:53.814\nThe customer doesn't need to see the fact\nthat it's been passed from one supplier\n\n413\n00:25:53.814 --> 00:26:00.090\nto another to another to another, and\nthen it's gone back to the customer fixed.\n\n414\n00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:03.695\nThe customer doesn't need to see\nwhat's happened in the background.\n\n415\n00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:08.150\nWe've still got to manage that\nbecause if we don't, trust me.\n\n416\n00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.250\nAnd I've known Justin well enough to\nknow that if I pass something to him,\n\n417\n00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:13.657\nhe might turn around to me and\nsay that's not my problem.\n\n418\n00:26:13.657 --> 00:26:14.482\nI'm not dealing with that.\n\n419\n00:26:14.482 --> 00:26:16.030\nAnd he's gonna pass it back to me.\n\n420\n00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.660\nAnd at the same time,\nif Justin gives [LAUGH] something to me,\n\n421\n00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:23.280\nthen I'm gonna say, nope,\nit's not happening.\n\n422\n00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.070\nAnd I'm gonna give it back to him.\n\n423\n00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:26.820\nSomebody's gotta manage that.\n\n424\n00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.474\nSomebody has got to come along [LAUGH] and\nsay, you two need to work together.\n\n425\n00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:34.650\nAnd that's exactly what has got to happen.\n\n426\n00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:37.060\nAnd this is why the SIAM ecosystem, and\n\n427\n00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:40.290\nthat service integrator role,\nis so important because\n\n428\n00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:45.400\nthat service integrator role is the one\nthat acts as the voice of reason.\n\n429\n00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:51.270\nThe one that simply lays out exactly\nwhat should happen in certain instances.\n\n430\n00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:56.120\nSo do you think that the service\nintegrator role, right, and\n\n431\n00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.660\nit's gonna be a group of people, do you\nthink that they need to be technical\n\n432\n00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.810\npeople?\n&gt;&gt; I would expect that they would need to\n\n433\n00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:02.650\nbe technical people.\n\n434\n00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:05.560\nBut they also need to have\na certain amount of people skills.\n\n435\n00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:09.680\nBecause I know a bunch of highly technical\npeople that would not serve as great\n\n436\n00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.190\nmoderators between individuals.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n437\n00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:13.030\n&gt;&gt; They would actually\n\n438\n00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.370\nexacerbate the situation,\nand choose a side.\n\n439\n00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:20.180\nAnd, I got him all ramped up now,\nand then leave, right.\n\n440\n00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.920\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, exactly.\n\n441\n00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.710\nWe do need to have interpersonal skills\n[LAUGH] in that particular role.\n\n442\n00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.570\nBut you've gotta have a technical bias,\nas well, in that particular role.\n\n443\n00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:31.610\nSometimes, in some ecosystems,\n\n444\n00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:35.450\nit's the service desk that actually\nact as the service integrator role.\n\n445\n00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:37.970\nIf you're using a service desk,\n\n446\n00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:41.670\nyou have to make sure that the service\ndesk are empowered to make decisions.\n\n447\n00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:45.626\nBecause we're talking about contracts\nwith external service providers.\n\n448\n00:27:45.626 --> 00:27:50.059\nSo it has to be somebody that's got\nenough technical knowledge to be\n\n449\n00:27:50.059 --> 00:27:54.116\nable to tell when somebody just\ndoesn't wanna do something.\n\n450\n00:27:54.116 --> 00:27:58.591\nIt's also gotta be enough\ntechnical knowledge to be able to\n\n451\n00:27:58.591 --> 00:28:02.617\nunderstand where the lines\nof responsibility lie and\n\n452\n00:28:02.617 --> 00:28:06.940\non what side of the line\na particular issue falls.\n\n453\n00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:10.090\nBut it's also got to be in somebody\nwith enough sort of, as you mentioned,\n\n454\n00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:12.710\ntheir interpersonal skills\nto be able to mediate, and\n\n455\n00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:17.490\nto be able to negotiate with\nthe service providers, too.\n\n456\n00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:21.200\nSo it has to be somebody\nthat can fulfill both roles.\n\n457\n00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.460\nBut they certainly do have to have\na certain amount of technical bias.\n\n458\n00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:28.520\nThey have to be able to understand\nwhat's being said to them.\n\n459\n00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:33.110\nAnd that leads us into this last\nparticular factor on this driver for\n\n460\n00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:35.230\nour sourcing landscape.\n\n461\n00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:37.480\nAnd that are inflexible contracts.\n\n462\n00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:45.070\nJustin and I have had discussions about\ninflexible contracts in the past.\n\n463\n00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:49.217\nAnd the fact that certain,\nespecially within government,\n\n464\n00:28:49.217 --> 00:28:53.781\ncertain contracts are negotiated for\nquite a long period of time.\n\n465\n00:28:53.781 --> 00:28:59.004\nBecause the actual process of negotiating\na contract, certainly in government,\n\n466\n00:28:59.004 --> 00:29:03.194\ncan take anywhere up to two years\nto go through the tender process.\n\n467\n00:29:03.194 --> 00:29:08.147\nAnd that can be quite a long\nprocess just in itself just\n\n468\n00:29:08.147 --> 00:29:12.070\nto negotiate a particular contract.\n\n469\n00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:15.780\nUnfortunately, the tendency is, then,\nthat we negotiate a contract for\n\n470\n00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:19.570\na long period of time because it's\ntaken two years to get to this point.\n\n471\n00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:22.730\nSo we're gonna negotiate a contract for\nat least five years.\n\n472\n00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.450\nNow, of course,\na lot can change in five years.\n\n473\n00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.480\nAnd this is where we bring\nin this inflexible contract.\n\n474\n00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.630\nBearing in mind that SIAM\ncame from the government.\n\n475\n00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:33.250\nVery similar to ITIL.\n\n476\n00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:38.270\nSo SIAM came from that\nparticular environment\n\n477\n00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:43.290\nwhere we quite often will end up with\ninflexible contracts, contracts that\n\n478\n00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:49.790\ndo not fit the needs of\nthe organization any more.\n\n479\n00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.485\nThey did when they were negotiated, and\n\n480\n00:29:52.485 --> 00:29:56.510\nat that point in time that they\nwere signed, they were great.\n\n481\n00:29:56.510 --> 00:30:00.470\nBut now technology's changed, our\nservice level targets have changed, and\n\n482\n00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:03.360\nour requirements have changed\nwithin the organization.\n\n483\n00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.490\nBut the contracts still remain the same.\n\n484\n00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.956\nWhat I've seen happen, and\nI have seen this, I have witnessed this\n\n485\n00:30:11.956 --> 00:30:16.175\nwith my own two eyes,\nis that in this particular situation,\n\n486\n00:30:16.175 --> 00:30:19.569\ninstead of trying to\nrenegotiate the contract,\n\n487\n00:30:19.569 --> 00:30:24.203\nwhat happens is a new contract is\nthen negotiated with a completely\n\n488\n00:30:24.203 --> 00:30:29.540\ndifferent supplier to make up for\nthe shortcomings in that first contract.\n\n489\n00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:34.482\nAnd again we end up in that situation\nwhere we are just kind of bringing more\n\n490\n00:30:34.482 --> 00:30:38.860\nsuppliers into the mix and\njust compounding the situation.\n\n491\n00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:39.727\nAnd Justin's grinning at me.\n\n492\n00:30:39.727 --> 00:30:42.750\nAnd you're gonna say that you've\nseen exactly the same thing happen.\n\n493\n00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:44.330\n&gt;&gt; I'm having bad nightmares and\n\n494\n00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:44.990\nflashbacks.\n\n495\n00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:48.606\nI'm about to break into a cold sweat\nbecause this it doesn't seem like\n\n496\n00:30:48.606 --> 00:30:49.718\nthis should happen.\n\n497\n00:30:49.718 --> 00:30:53.266\nYou're like, wait a minute, you\nnegotiated a contract five years ago for\n\n498\n00:30:53.266 --> 00:30:57.211\nsomething you're supposed to deliver a\nyear from now that you didn't actually get\n\n499\n00:30:57.211 --> 00:30:58.986\nto start working on until last year?\n\n500\n00:30:58.986 --> 00:31:03.446\nYes.\nAnd that's just how things roll.\n\n501\n00:31:03.446 --> 00:31:07.175\nAnd I have also seen, well,\nwe brought in this other person,\n\n502\n00:31:07.175 --> 00:31:11.694\nor this other whatever it may be,\nthis other company, to fix this one issue\n\n503\n00:31:11.694 --> 00:31:16.850\nthat we didn't really think about during\nthe original contract negotiations.\n\n504\n00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:20.830\nAnd now you're like, well, am I supposed\nto work with that person, or am I?\n\n505\n00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:25.480\nYou kinda get this weird flux of,\nokay, I'm kinda lost,\n\n506\n00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.060\nif it's not managed appropriately.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I have seen contracts that\n\n507\n00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:32.680\nhave been negotiated for things like\nprinting services, for instance.\n\n508\n00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.261\nSo the contract was negotiated,\n\n509\n00:31:34.261 --> 00:31:38.280\nit took nearly two years to negotiate the\ncontract, and it was finally negotiated.\n\n510\n00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.598\nIt went out to tender, etc.\n\n511\n00:31:41.598 --> 00:31:42.930\nIt was signed.\n\n512\n00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:47.510\nAnd then, we realize that actually\nprinting is no longer required because\n\n513\n00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:52.090\nwhat's happening is that the entire\ngovernment department is then moving\n\n514\n00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:55.434\ntoward paperless printing,\nmoving toward PDFs, and\n\n515\n00:31:55.434 --> 00:31:59.670\nscanning is actually more important\nthan the printing itself.\n\n516\n00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:03.970\nBut because the initial contract was so\ninflexible, what happens is that you wound\n\n517\n00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:09.070\nup then having to go through the entire\ninvitation to tender process again\n\n518\n00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:15.180\nbecause what you need to do is negotiate a\nnew contract to look at scanning services.\n\n519\n00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:20.290\nWell, and that's gonna take another\ntwo years by the way, by which time\n\n520\n00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:24.990\nIn two year's time, then that particular\nissue may well have moved on.\n\n521\n00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:28.200\nIt may well have evolved, and\nwe might have something else.\n\n522\n00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:32.000\nAnd so what you're doing is every\ntime we're negotiating a new contract\n\n523\n00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.890\non top of the other one.\n\n524\n00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:38.020\nAnd then, by the time we've negotiated\nmaybe our third contract to fix\n\n525\n00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:42.020\nthe problems in the previous contract,\nthen that first contact's now up for\n\n526\n00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.260\nrenewal and it's expired.\n\n527\n00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:48.140\nBut we've gotta be careful then how we\nrenew that first contract because it might\n\n528\n00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:52.120\nimpact the other two contracts\nthat we've got in place right now.\n\n529\n00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.640\nYou end up in a mess, it ends up in chaos.\n\n530\n00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.060\nAnd more importantly,\n\n531\n00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:01.520\nfrom a service provider perspective,\nyou just wanna run away screaming,\n\n532\n00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.510\nbecause you've got yourself into\na position that you can't get out of.\n\n533\n00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:11.080\nThis is why the SIAM\necosystem is important.\n\n534\n00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.090\nThe service integrator role\n\n535\n00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:18.320\nis the role that manages\nthe complexity between the contracts.\n\n536\n00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:23.240\nThe service integrator will always,\nis the role, a group of people that will\n\n537\n00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:28.690\nstep in and say, no, no, no,\nno we cannot have inflexible contracts.\n\n538\n00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:33.150\nAnd as each contract comes up for renewal,\nthen we're looking at the flexibility,\n\n539\n00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:37.160\nthe contract, and we're looking at the\npurpose of that contract, understanding\n\n540\n00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:44.430\nthat IT just evolves incredibly\nquickly in the 21st century.\n\n541\n00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:48.140\nSo what we've done really in this last\nepisode is we've look at our second\n\n542\n00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:54.770\ndriver, and that's a driver for\nimplementing the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n543\n00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:58.160\nAnd in our next episode,\nepisode three of our mini-series,\n\n544\n00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.680\nthen we're going to be looking\nat our next driver for\n\n545\n00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.810\nimplementing the SIAM ecosystem,\nand that's going to be operational\n\n546\n00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:07.230\neffectiveness.\n&gt;&gt; Effectiveness,\n\n547\n00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:11.040\nI'm pretty sure that one's going to be\nan interesting set of conversations.\n\n548\n00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:15.230\nBut you'll just have to come on back and\nsee if that proves true.\n\n549\n00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.630\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n550\n00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:20.250\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n551\n00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:21.160\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n552\n00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:21.722\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n553\n00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:29.328\n[MUSIC]\n\n554\n00:34:29.328 --> 00:34:32.168\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

Greetings everyone, and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of IT PRO TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.718\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and\nwe're continuing on with SIAM foundation.\n\n7\n00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:23.094\nAnd [SOUND] almost put an s on that again,\nJo, I'll tell you what.\n\n8\n00:00:23.094 --> 00:00:25.500\nIt's gonna get me once or\ntwice in this series.\n\n9\n00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.550\nAnd we're gonna be looking at operational\nefficiencies in this episode, and\n\n10\n00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.640\nhere to help us along is Ms Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.710\nHow you doing today, Jo?\n\n12\n00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.440\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Justin.\n\n13\n00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.640\nI'm gonna start, I'm gonna try and\ntake s out of your Alphabet.\n\n14\n00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.440\n&gt;&gt; That is,\nthat's gonna make my name weird.\n\n15\n00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.065\nIt'll be Jutin I guess.\n\n16\n00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:45.920\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but you know,\n\n17\n00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.060\nI know some people who don't pronounce.\n\n18\n00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.280\nI mean you want to move to London.\n\n19\n00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.210\nThey done have H in their alphabet there.\n\n20\n00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.930\n&gt;&gt; I guess that's true.\n\n21\n00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.499\nI think my first name being\nJutin would be weird though.\n\n22\n00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.310\n&gt;&gt; Well nobody could ever work\nout what my first name is.\n\n23\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.752\n&gt;&gt; And\nI guess my last name would be Denion.\n\n24\n00:01:03.752 --> 00:01:08.520\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now that has a certain je ne\n\n25\n00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.920\nsais quoi to that, yeah.\n\n26\n00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.050\n&gt;&gt; Yes it does.\n\n27\n00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.360\n&gt;&gt; Well, what can I say, anyway [LAUGH].\n\n28\n00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.115\nWhat we're gonna be looking at,\nwe're in part three of our little\n\n29\n00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:23.580\nmini-series here where we're looking\nat drives for implementing SIAM, and\n\n30\n00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.770\nso in this particular episode we're going\nto be looking at the driver of operational\n\n31\n00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.260\nefficiencies and effectiveness as well\nas a driver for implementing SIAM.\n\n32\n00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.780\nSo I hope you're prepared for\nthat, Justin.\n\n33\n00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.620\n&gt;&gt; Well I would like to say that I am, but\n\n34\n00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.635\nyou never know when Jo's involved,\nso I'm gonna say yes.\n\n35\n00:01:43.635 --> 00:01:46.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; With full recognition that I\n\n36\n00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.530\nmay just think that I'm prepared and then\nI'm actually just horribly unprepared.\n\n37\n00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.770\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know what to say now.\n\n38\n00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.605\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You never know when I'm involved, okay?\n\n39\n00:01:55.605 --> 00:01:56.145\nOk, right.\n\n40\n00:01:56.145 --> 00:02:00.135\nSo now is the time when I put\nJustin through the ringer.\n\n41\n00:02:00.135 --> 00:02:02.525\nBut, okay, he set himself up for this one.\n\n42\n00:02:02.525 --> 00:02:08.465\nAnd so, in our last two episodes we looked\nat the reasons why the drivers behind,\n\n43\n00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:11.435\nor evolving,\nI was going to say implementing.\n\n44\n00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:14.505\nBut evolving to the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n45\n00:02:14.505 --> 00:02:18.910\nThere's a reason by the way,\nwhy I sort of corrected myself.\n\n46\n00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.560\nYou don't just implement SIAM ecosystem,\n\n47\n00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.090\nit's not something that you can just sort\nof open the book, it's not plug and play.\n\n48\n00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.590\nYou can't just open a book and\nread through some theory and\n\n49\n00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.050\nsay that's gonna work for me,\nI think I will implement that.\n\n50\n00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.430\nThis is an evolution.\n\n51\n00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.430\nAnd most organizations, and\nwe'll look at this in a later episode, but\n\n52\n00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.660\nmost organizations that move to\nthe SIAM ecosystem are moving from\n\n53\n00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.820\nan ITIL based methodology,\nan ITIL based framework.\n\n54\n00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.090\nSo they've already got a structure in\nplace for managing their IT services.\n\n55\n00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.920\nBut what they find is that that structure\nis not a comprehensive enough to\n\n56\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.630\ndeal with the complexities\nof the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n57\n00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.950\nAs we know the SIAM\necosystem is a system for\n\n58\n00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.229\ndelivering services,\ndelivering value to customers.\n\n59\n00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.850\nBut using more than one service provider.\n\n60\n00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.150\nThat's pretty much\nthe norm nowadays anyway.\n\n61\n00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.990\nThis is not something that's unusual.\n\n62\n00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.950\nSo whereas the ideal framework\ngives us a huge amount of benefit.\n\n63\n00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.730\nIt gives us efficiencies and effectiveness\nin service delivery, delivering value to\n\n64\n00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.340\nour customers for an internal service\nprovider and a single service provider.\n\n65\n00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.470\nHowever, what ITIL doesn't\ngive us is the efficiencies\n\n66\n00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.612\nthat are required to be able to\nmanage multiple service providers.\n\n67\n00:03:46.612 --> 00:03:50.940\nAnd so the SIAM ecosystem is something\nthat we would evolve generally\n\n68\n00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.870\nfrom an ITIL based framework.\n\n69\n00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.490\nInto this SIAM ecosystem\nbecause it gives us a way,\n\n70\n00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:02.880\nit allows us to consider\nthe multi-vendor service provider.\n\n71\n00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.500\nWhere we are managing across\nmulti-platforms, and multi-vendors\n\n72\n00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.289\nin order to deliver services, and\nin order deliver value to our end users.\n\n73\n00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.660\nSo why would we choose to move from\na methodology say a framework like ITIL,\n\n74\n00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.030\nor maybe from an ISO 20,000\nenvironment into SIAM?\n\n75\n00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.490\nWell we've already looked at two drivers,\n\n76\n00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.090\nwe've looked at the external\nsourcing landscape as we called it.\n\n77\n00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.570\nAnd we also looked at satisfaction\nas well, customer satisfaction and\n\n78\n00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.260\nservice satisfaction.\n\n79\n00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.600\nAnd now we're gonna look\nat our third driver.\n\n80\n00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.340\nAnd bear it in mind that\na driver is the reason why,\n\n81\n00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.260\nwhy would we move to SIAM as an ecosystem,\n\n82\n00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.500\nas a way of managing our services,\nand a way of delivering our services.\n\n83\n00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.660\nWell, why?\n\n84\n00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.430\nMaybe because we want to improve\nour operational efficiency and\n\n85\n00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.200\nour operational effectiveness.\n\n86\n00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.260\nSo, before we take a look at a slide,\nI'm gonna put Justin on the spot again.\n\n87\n00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.070\nCuz, you know, I promised I would,\nand I have to.\n\n88\n00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.099\nIt's kind of the only fun\nI get nowadays really.\n\n89\n00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.363\n[LAUGH] So Justin, what's the difference\nbetween efficiency and effectiveness?\n\n90\n00:05:15.363 --> 00:05:16.624\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I knew it was coming.\n\n91\n00:05:16.624 --> 00:05:18.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As soon as you say those two words,\n\n92\n00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.584\nI was like I should probably\nlook up the difference.\n\n93\n00:05:20.584 --> 00:05:23.262\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Between effectiveness and efficiency.\n\n94\n00:05:23.262 --> 00:05:25.310\nSo from a scientific perspective,\n\n95\n00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.570\nI think of efficiency as\nthe return on energy input.\n\n96\n00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.650\nSo whatever energy I give in, I give out.\n\n97\n00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.790\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah!\n\n98\n00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.810\n&gt;&gt; That sounded fancy, that did, right?\n\n99\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.340\nWhoah, hey.\n\n100\n00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.070\n&gt;&gt; It did.\n\n101\n00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.572\nIt was almost as fancy as.\n\n102\n00:05:40.572 --> 00:05:47.490\nAnd then, effectiveness is how close to\nbeing right, to actual getting the goal.\n\n103\n00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.440\nThose would be how I would describe\nthe differences between those.\n\n104\n00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.770\nBut I can see from the sideways\nglance that you can't see off camera\n\n105\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.700\nthat I haven't quite hit\nthe nail on the head.\n\n106\n00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.490\n&gt;&gt; Well it's not about\nhitting the nail on the head.\n\n107\n00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.630\nI just wanna put it in In sort\nof simple terms really cuz\n\n108\n00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.960\nI'm a simple kind of girl.\n\n109\n00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.330\n&gt;&gt; I think our idea of simple terms\nmight be a little bit different, Joe.\n\n110\n00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.750\n&gt;&gt; Well that certainly wasn't\nsimple from my perspective.\n\n111\n00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.110\nNow I haven't got a clue where\nhe'd gone at that point in time.\n\n112\n00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.270\nRight, so\nlet's start off with effectiveness.\n\n113\n00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.350\nEffectiveness is just simply does\nit do what it's supposed to do?\n\n114\n00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.420\nDoes it achieve the end result?\n\n115\n00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.260\nSo, does it meet its objective?\n\n116\n00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.930\nDoes it do what it's suppose to do?\n\n117\n00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.160\nDoes it do what it says on the can,\nbasically?\n\n118\n00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.170\nYou know, is it a can of beans then is\nit a can of beans when you open it?\n\n119\n00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.730\nSimple as that, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.390\nThat's what we mean effectiveness.\n\n121\n00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.290\nDoes it do what it's suppose to do?\n\n122\n00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.090\nSo in terms of a process,\ndoes it meet the goal of that process?\n\n123\n00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.090\nIn terms of the service.\n\n124\n00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.540\nDoes it send and receive email?\n\n125\n00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.740\nBecause that's what its goal is,\nso that's is its effectiveness,\n\n126\n00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.140\ndoes it do what it is supposed to do?\n\n127\n00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.230\nAnd when we think about efficiency\nin terms of a service management\n\n128\n00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.130\napproach then we think of efficiency\nas being achieving that goal,\n\n129\n00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.089\nachieving effectiveness but\nwith minimal waste.\n\n130\n00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.190\nThat sound all right?\n\n131\n00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I mean the higher\nefficiency of any simple machine is,\n\n132\n00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.680\nthe higher it is,\n\n133\n00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.190\nyou get the most out based on\nthe energy that you put in, right?\n\n134\n00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.680\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You don't want to do 15 steps to send\n\n135\n00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.440\nan email.\n\n136\n00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.000\nI wanna go, email, click, done, right?\n\n137\n00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.310\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we're talking minimal\nwaste of in terms of time.\n\n138\n00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.030\nWhich is quite often how we think about\nsomething that's efficient is fast.\n\n139\n00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.710\nBut minimal waste, in terms of time.\n\n140\n00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.010\nMinimal waste in terms of money.\n\n141\n00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.240\nYeah, that's something else that we quite\noften think about with efficiencies.\n\n142\n00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.030\nBut also minimal waste in terms of skills,\nas well.\n\n143\n00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.480\nHaving the right person\nto do the right job.\n\n144\n00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.914\nIf I have got somebody who's underskilled\nto do a particular role, then I know for\n\n145\n00:07:48.914 --> 00:07:52.127\na fact that they're not going\nto be as efficient as somebody\n\n146\n00:07:52.127 --> 00:07:56.368\nwho's got the right level of skills,\nbecause I know that they're gonna spend\n\n147\n00:07:56.368 --> 00:08:00.770\na lot of time potentially asking other\npeople, or maybe looking up notes, etc.\n\n148\n00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.910\nSo I know that They're not\ngoing to be as efficient and\n\n149\n00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.000\nmay not even be as effective.\n\n150\n00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.414\nBut did you know that if I've got somebody\noverskilled, they're probably going to be\n\n151\n00:08:12.414 --> 00:08:15.387\njust as inefficient as\nthe person that's underskilled?\n\n152\n00:08:15.387 --> 00:08:20.085\n&gt;&gt; Would that inefficiency come from\nthe fact that for that given position,\n\n153\n00:08:20.085 --> 00:08:22.055\nif they're way overskilled,\n\n154\n00:08:22.055 --> 00:08:26.240\nthen there's a cost associated\nwith having that person do that?\n\n155\n00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.470\nOr is it just because they tend\nto overthink these things?\n\n156\n00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:34.150\n&gt;&gt; No, actually it's neither one of those,\ncuz we're talking about skills, not cost.\n\n157\n00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.620\nThere is a cost inefficiency in\nhaving somebody that's overskilled.\n\n158\n00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.709\nBut having somebody that's overskilled,\n\n159\n00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:43.830\ndo you think they're gonna give 100% of\ntheir effort and 100% of their thought\n\n160\n00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.558\ninto that particular job if they perceive\nthat that role is something, or that\n\n161\n00:08:47.558 --> 00:08:51.692\nparticular activity is something that they\ncan do with their hands behind their back?\n\n162\n00:08:51.692 --> 00:08:53.027\n&gt;&gt; Probably not.\n\n163\n00:08:53.027 --> 00:08:53.584\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n164\n00:08:53.584 --> 00:08:57.240\n&gt;&gt; I mean, if it's percieved as\na menial task, I don't know,\n\n165\n00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:02.390\nif that breeds like resentment or like,\nwhy are they giving me such menial tasks?\n\n166\n00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.490\nWhereas, from the business perspective, it\nstill may be incredibly valuable, right?\n\n167\n00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.955\n&gt;&gt; Right, having somebody that's\noverskilled, you generally find that\n\n168\n00:09:08.955 --> 00:09:13.430\nyou'll have somebody that,\nthey might give 100% of the effort for\n\n169\n00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:17.180\nthe first ten minutes, but then after\nthat it's I can do this blindfolded.\n\n170\n00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.790\nAnd then you don't give\n100% of the effort,\n\n171\n00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:24.540\nwhich means that either they're not\ndoing it as quickly as they should or\n\n172\n00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.350\nmaybe they're doing it too quickly and\nthey're missing things.\n\n173\n00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:31.510\nBut either way it's not going to be to as\ngood a quality as the person who doesn't\n\n174\n00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:36.130\nhave enough skills who's actually going\nto put the effort into doing that\n\n175\n00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:40.240\nparticular activity and is going to put\nthe effort into making sure it's right.\n\n176\n00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.910\nThe person that's overskilled is only\ngoing to a certain amount of effort\n\n177\n00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:44.860\ninto that.\n\n178\n00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:49.550\nThe person that's overskilled also has\na temptation to multitask as well.\n\n179\n00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:50.650\nAnd with multitasking,\n\n180\n00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:54.770\nwe know that that's an inefficient way\nof approaching any particular task.\n\n181\n00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.320\nCuz every time you switch\nbetween your tasks,\n\n182\n00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.890\nyou're in effect starting\nfrom the beginning again.\n\n183\n00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:05.010\nSo when we think about efficiency,\nwe think about minimal waste.\n\n184\n00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.460\nAnd we think predominantly about\nminimal waste in terms of time and\n\n185\n00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.830\nin terms of money and\nin terms of skill levels as well.\n\n186\n00:10:13.524 --> 00:10:17.740\nSo efficiencies, as it tells us on\nthis particular slide, are, well,\n\n187\n00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:22.190\nwhat we're aiming for improvements to\nthe end to end delivery of the services.\n\n188\n00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.480\nSo what we want to do,\nin order to increase efficiency,\n\n189\n00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.730\nwhat we want to do is we want to\nimplement some standardization.\n\n190\n00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:36.250\nWe want to implement some consistency\nacross all of our processes.\n\n191\n00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.140\nAnd consistency across\nall of our skills and\n\n192\n00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.970\nconsistency across our\nutilization of money as well.\n\n193\n00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.420\nSo I've used the word\nconsistency quite a few times.\n\n194\n00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:52.260\nAnd you'll see that the first box\nthat we have there, with our first\n\n195\n00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.685\nparticular item, talks about disparate\nservice management capabilities.\n\n196\n00:10:56.685 --> 00:11:02.210\nWell if we've got disparate capabilities,\nthen we probably haven't got consistency.\n\n197\n00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.760\nSo let me ask you another question.\n\n198\n00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:12.110\nAnd this has got absolutely nothing to do\nwith nothing technical at all, all right?\n\n199\n00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.020\nI see you looking at me like that.\n\n200\n00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.390\nNothing technical at all.\n\n201\n00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.780\nDo you think that you have got a,\n\n202\n00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.990\nwe've got quite a few people with\ndisparate skills in our organization, and\n\n203\n00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.770\namongst us as edutainers we've got quite\na few people with disparate skills.\n\n204\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.374\nDo you think that you have,\njust you, on your own,\n\n205\n00:11:29.374 --> 00:11:33.266\ndo you think you have a good understanding\nof what skills everybody has got?\n\n206\n00:11:33.266 --> 00:11:35.530\n&gt;&gt; I would say probably not.\n\n207\n00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:40.890\nI have a small glimpse of\nrespective skills of individuals,\n\n208\n00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:45.430\nbut I would not say that I have a deep\nunderstanding of what skills they are,\n\n209\n00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:50.040\nwhere overlaps exist between those\nindividuals, or where they do not overlap.\n\n210\n00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.600\n&gt;&gt; Right, and bearing in mind that\nevery time, every show that we do,\n\n211\n00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.740\nit doesn't matter which side of\nthe podium that we're standing on,\n\n212\n00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.810\nwe're always learning something new.\n\n213\n00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:04.130\nSo our skills are always changing,\nthey're always increasing.\n\n214\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:08.290\nAnd I ask that question, just as\nan example, because even amongst us\n\n215\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.060\nwe don't necessarily know exactly\nwhat skills anybody's got.\n\n216\n00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.800\nAnd then I go on to ask the question if\nI'm in an organization I'll go on to ask\n\n217\n00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:16.930\nthat question of,\n\n218\n00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.820\nwell, where would go if we wanted to\nfind out what skills people have?\n\n219\n00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.574\nAnd the answer invariably is-\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing to the individual, I mean,\n\n220\n00:12:26.574 --> 00:12:27.829\nI would go to the indidvidual.\n\n221\n00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:28.537\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n222\n00:12:28.537 --> 00:12:32.521\n&gt;&gt; To find out, maybe ask pointed\nquestions, don't come in accusatory or\n\n223\n00:12:32.521 --> 00:12:34.275\nwhatever but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n224\n00:12:34.275 --> 00:12:34.906\n&gt;&gt; But look, listen,\n\n225\n00:12:34.906 --> 00:12:36.513\nif you don't have this,\nthen you're in trouble.\n\n226\n00:12:36.513 --> 00:12:37.059\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n227\n00:12:37.059 --> 00:12:41.435\n&gt;&gt; But maybe some query,\nsome probing, just to, I don't know,\n\n228\n00:12:41.435 --> 00:12:45.090\nan information gathering expedition,\nI guess.\n\n229\n00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:50.090\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so the issue then is,\nlet's just say for\n\n230\n00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:54.750\nexample that I am starting\noff a project and\n\n231\n00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.490\nI need somebody with\na certain level of skills.\n\n232\n00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:03.580\nIs it going to be efficient for\nme to run around the building\n\n233\n00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.180\ntrying to find out who's got\na certain particular skill level?\n\n234\n00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.080\nOr is it going to be more efficient for\nme to go to a particular database and\n\n235\n00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.940\nlook to see who's got that\nspecific skill level?\n\n236\n00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.211\nWhich is gonna be more efficient?\n\n237\n00:13:16.211 --> 00:13:20.287\n&gt;&gt; I would say from a time perspective if\nwe have the database then that's going to\n\n238\n00:13:20.287 --> 00:13:21.850\nbe very efficient to look at.\n\n239\n00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.872\nBut that implies there is a certain\namount of either self-reporting\n\n240\n00:13:24.872 --> 00:13:25.536\nor-\n&gt;&gt;

Right.\n\n257\n00:14:11.258 --> 00:14:13.419\n&gt;&gt; Just because I know\nthat's one of his skills.\n\n258\n00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:13.989\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n259\n00:14:13.989 --> 00:14:15.880\n&gt;&gt;

I get in trouble a lot because I'm\n\n267\n00:14:36.741 --> 00:14:39.620\nlouder than I mean to be and\nI have a big belly laugh.\n\n268\n00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.379\nI don't know, I can't help it.\n\n269\n00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:44.178\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he's always the one standing\noutside of the studio while we're\n\n270\n00:14:44.178 --> 00:14:47.254\nrecording that I have to go and\nbeat up a little bit later.\n\n271\n00:14:47.254 --> 00:14:50.840\n[LAUGH] No, I mean we,\nwe've got loud voices, we'll shout.\n\n272\n00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.660\nAnd we will quite happily stand up and\nsay, hey, look, who knows about this?\n\n273\n00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.560\nBut in a lot of instances\nthat's not always practical.\n\n274\n00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.580\nBut we're in one environment.\n\n275\n00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.915\nNow let's just imagine then\nthat we are talking about\n\n276\n00:15:05.915 --> 00:15:09.400\ndifferent disparate service providers.\n\n277\n00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.750\nAnd with each service provider they are\nproviding us with a particular service,\n\n278\n00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.860\nbut then they've also\ngot varying skills and\n\n279\n00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:21.090\nvarying skill levels within each\nservice provider organization.\n\n280\n00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.564\nSo how on earth do we find\nout who's got what skills?\n\n281\n00:15:25.805 --> 00:15:31.280\nIt's difficult enough when we're in\none office and we've got to find out.\n\n282\n00:15:32.625 --> 00:15:34.450\nBut when you're in multiple offices,\n\n283\n00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:38.560\npotentially spread around the globe,\nthat's gonna be incredibly difficult.\n\n284\n00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.929\nSo just that on its own\nis a key driver for\n\n285\n00:15:41.929 --> 00:15:46.526\nmoving to an ecosystem that\nallows us to manage this,\n\n286\n00:15:46.526 --> 00:15:53.189\nthat allows us to recognize the fact\nthat we've got different skill levels.\n\n287\n00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:56.520\nWe talk about efficiency and\nefficiency means minimal waste.\n\n288\n00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.111\nWhich means that duplication\nis not efficient.\n\n289\n00:15:59.111 --> 00:16:05.271\nShould we have both\n\n290\n00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:12.205\nservice providers?\n\n291\n00:16:12.205 --> 00:16:18.530\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Are they complete overlap, or-\n&gt;&gt; I just mention the word duplication.\n\n292\n00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.256\n&gt;&gt; See that gets tough, Jo.\n\n293\n00:16:21.256 --> 00:16:22.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That gets tough because\n\n294\n00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.120\nmaybe that's not the skill.\n\n295\n00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:28.120\nEven iff they haven't overlapped\nthe skills, if we're not using\n\n296\n00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:32.490\ntwo service providers as\nthe same skill then, yeah.\n\n297\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:36.460\nI'm gonna say yeah we can have both\neven if they have that skillset.\n\n298\n00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:41.168\nBut if they have the disjoint ones, they\nare mutually exclusive for this skill, and\n\n299\n00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:45.037\nwe are using that one and that one,\nI say you gotta have both of those.\n\n300\n00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:46.252\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because that's what we need.\n\n301\n00:16:46.252 --> 00:16:51.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so now I'm gonna add in another\nlevel of complexity to this work,\n\n302\n00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.325\nbecause that's what I do.\n\n303\n00:16:53.325 --> 00:16:55.240\n[LAUGH] It's what I do best.\n\n304\n00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.119\nSo, now imagine then that we've go\nthe shadow IT that we've talked about in\n\n305\n00:16:59.119 --> 00:17:03.257\na previous episode, where we've got\ndifferent business units that have gone.\n\n306\n00:17:03.257 --> 00:17:08.240\nAnd they have outsourced their\nparticular requirement to\n\n307\n00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.280\ndifferent service providers.\n\n308\n00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.060\nThese business units may not\neven talk to each other.\n\n309\n00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:19.520\nThat in itself is inefficient, but\nthen let's just think that each of these\n\n310\n00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.220\nservice providers have then got\nthat duplication of skills.\n\n311\n00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.590\nAnd these are skills that we've also\ngot internally within our own IT.\n\n312\n00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.010\nOur challenges, how do we identify\nthat we've got that duplication?\n\n313\n00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.170\nAnd then what do we do\nabout that duplication?\n\n314\n00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:36.580\nBecause I'll guarantee that if we're\nusing external service providers,\n\n315\n00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.330\nit's costing us money.\n\n316\n00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.570\nAnd it was costing us money and\n\n317\n00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:45.165\nwith duplicating skills, then we're\npaying twice for the same skill.\n\n318\n00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.154\n&gt;&gt; But what if it's not the skill that\n\n319\n00:17:49.154 --> 00:17:50.295\nwe're utilizing-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n320\n00:17:50.295 --> 00:17:51.547\n&gt;&gt; From those respective.\n\n321\n00:17:51.547 --> 00:17:55.890\nSo yeah, just because of my personal bias,\nlike cloud providers,\n\n322\n00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:56.513\nthey-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n323\n00:17:56.513 --> 00:18:01.491\n&gt;&gt; Provide a lot of the overlap, but there\nare sometimes individual services within\n\n324\n00:18:01.491 --> 00:18:04.822\nthose cloud providers that\nthe other ones do not have.\n\n325\n00:18:04.822 --> 00:18:05.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n326\n00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:09.110\n&gt;&gt; If I'm using just those services,\nright?\n\n327\n00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:13.100\nI have this, I'm looking for image\nrecognition and this other thing, and\n\n328\n00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.020\nthose are the two business units.\n\n329\n00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.990\nThen how do we remove the duplication,\n\n330\n00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.705\nbecause there is a large overlap\nbetween those two things, right?\n\n331\n00:18:20.705 --> 00:18:22.635\n&gt;&gt; No, I never said it was gonna be easy.\n\n332\n00:18:22.635 --> 00:18:27.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Jo, you're making promises, that well,\n\n333\n00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:27.820\nthey're hard to keep.\n\n334\n00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI never said that this was gonna be easy.\n\n335\n00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.710\nWhat I've just said was I'm\ngonna give you a dilemma and\n\n336\n00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.250\nthis is the sort of thing\nthat we've got to sort out.\n\n337\n00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.020\nIn our service integrator layer,\n\n338\n00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:40.530\nthese are the types of\ndiscussions that we have to have.\n\n339\n00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:43.129\nAnd we'll look at how we have these\ndiscussions a little bit later.\n\n340\n00:18:43.129 --> 00:18:46.911\nBut quite often, having this kind of\ndialect, this kind of conversation,\n\n341\n00:18:46.911 --> 00:18:48.389\nhelps with that discussion,\n\n342\n00:18:48.389 --> 00:18:52.570\ncuz it helps bring in other factors\nthat we hadn't even thought about.\n\n343\n00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:57.910\nBut these are drivers for\nmoving to that SIAM ecosystem,\n\n344\n00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:02.100\nbecause we've got to think about\nwhere we're spending our money.\n\n345\n00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:07.117\nAnd the fact that we've got two\nservices providers, three, four,\n\n346\n00:19:07.117 --> 00:19:11.963\nfive, six service providers that\nhave an element of uniqueness,\n\n347\n00:19:11.963 --> 00:19:15.533\nthat have an element of,\nthis is my specialism.\n\n348\n00:19:15.533 --> 00:19:19.261\nWhereas they also have an element\nof generic skills that\n\n349\n00:19:19.261 --> 00:19:22.844\nare duplicated across all\nof our service providers.\n\n350\n00:19:22.844 --> 00:19:23.812\nFor instance,\n\n351\n00:19:23.812 --> 00:19:28.887\nevery single service provider will provide\nsome full move directory services.\n\n352\n00:19:30.188 --> 00:19:32.320\nSo why don't we centralize that?\n\n353\n00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.840\nAnd by the way, this is not a question\nI want you ask, I want you to answer,\n\n354\n00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.560\nbecause there's no right or wrong to that.\n\n355\n00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.800\nBut these are the questions\nthat as a service integrator,\n\n356\n00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.960\nyou are going to have to ask,\nbecause we've got to make sure we get\n\n357\n00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.459\nbetter value for\nmoney out of our suppliers.\n\n358\n00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.580\nNo, he's thinking again.\n\n359\n00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:54.620\n&gt;&gt; So I can see from an efficiency\npoint of view there's even\n\n360\n00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.180\nwithin that internal one, right?\n\n361\n00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.733\nWe talked about time efficiency,\ncost efficiency,\n\n362\n00:19:58.733 --> 00:19:59.580\nand-\n&gt;&gt; Skills.\n\n363\n00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.670\n&gt;&gt; Skills, skills efficiency.\n\n364\n00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.934\nSome of those can be in direct\nopposotion with each other.\n\n365\n00:20:03.934 --> 00:20:06.730\nAnd do I have that correct?\n\n366\n00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:11.220\nI can spend more money,\nwhich may not necessarily be as efficient,\n\n367\n00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.660\nin order to reduce the time\nneeded to have something occur.\n\n368\n00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.300\n&gt;&gt; Right, so let's think about\nwhen we go into a supermarket, or\n\n369\n00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:24.950\nwe go into a grocery store,\nwe have this this general feeling.\n\n370\n00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.000\nIt's a bit like going and\nbuying a car actually.\n\n371\n00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.780\nYou have this general feeling,\nthat if I spend more money,\n\n372\n00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.040\nI'm gonna get higher quality, right?\n\n373\n00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.070\nThat's not necessarily the case, and\n\n374\n00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:35.820\nit's exactly the same with\nour service providers too.\n\n375\n00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.673\nJust because you're [LAUGH] spending more\nmoney and you're buying more resources,\n\n376\n00:20:39.673 --> 00:20:42.900\nit doesn't necessarily mean\nyou're gonna get better quality.\n\n377\n00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.130\nAnd in fact what you could get is somebody\nelse offering to do exactly the same\n\n378\n00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:50.740\njob as another service provider,\nbut to exactly the same quality.\n\n379\n00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.870\nOr it might be that you're spending\nmore money and getting a lower quality.\n\n380\n00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.610\nThat's what your service\nintegrator is there for,\n\n381\n00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:59.360\nthey're there to work this one out.\n\n382\n00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.860\nSo please don't look so confused.\n\n383\n00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.955\nAll right,\nI can see his brain is hurting right now.\n\n384\n00:21:03.955 --> 00:21:06.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is not a look of confusion.\n\n385\n00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:10.720\nIt's a look of, I felt that role would be\nfun until I started thinking about these\n\n386\n00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.188\nI'm like they actually have-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n\n387\n00:21:13.188 --> 00:21:14.340\n&gt;&gt; They actually have,\n\n388\n00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.900\nthat's a lot to think\nabout because there's so\n\n389\n00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.076\nmany kind of long standing, long term or\n\n390\n00:21:19.076 --> 00:21:23.238\nwidespread ramifications of decisions\nmade from these respective things.\n\n391\n00:21:23.238 --> 00:21:27.794\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's go back to our previous\nepisode where we talked about government\n\n392\n00:21:27.794 --> 00:21:28.531\ncontracts.\n\n393\n00:21:28.531 --> 00:21:31.555\nAnd we talked about the fact that\nthese could be negotiated for\n\n394\n00:21:31.555 --> 00:21:32.940\na long period of time.\n\n395\n00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:38.720\nAnd then we end up with another\ncontract to negate the implications\n\n396\n00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.510\nof the first contract, and then another\ncontract to negate those implications.\n\n397\n00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:46.138\nWell let's take a look at those, and now\nall of the sudden we bring all of this in,\n\n398\n00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:50.630\nand the duplication, I mean, tell me\nthere's not any duplication in that.\n\n399\n00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:55.070\n&gt;&gt; I can't tell you that Jo I'd be lying,\nI'd be lying.\n\n400\n00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.970\n&gt;&gt; So we're in a bit of a pickle,\nright, we're in a bit of a mess.\n\n401\n00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:02.450\nAnd this is why this service integrator\nrole is actually really important.\n\n402\n00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.400\nBut Justin has just realized now\nthat this service integrator role\n\n403\n00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.665\nis not a role that he wants to do.\n\n404\n00:22:07.665 --> 00:22:10.320\n[LAUGH] It fair to say.\n\n405\n00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.220\nSo what else then, what else would\ninfluence these operational efficiencies?\n\n406\n00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:19.640\nWell, we've got here data and\ninformation flows, data itself\n\n407\n00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:24.260\nis duplicated and data itself,\nI see this duplicated in so many places.\n\n408\n00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.970\nIn ITIL, we explore the single\nsource of consistent,\n\n409\n00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.430\nof accurate, reliable information.\n\n410\n00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:38.420\nBut having relationships in place between\nour data sources to ensure consistency,\n\n411\n00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.660\nand to ensure that we\ncan rely on that data.\n\n412\n00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.070\nAnd again, we're thinking about\noperational efficiencies here.\n\n413\n00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:52.302\nNow let's just think about all of those\ndiffering suppliers that we have.\n\n414\n00:22:52.302 --> 00:22:56.225\nHow much data they have,\nhow much duplication they have and\n\n415\n00:22:56.225 --> 00:22:57.641\nwhere is our single.\n\n416\n00:22:57.641 --> 00:23:02.132\nSo I don't wanna go any further because\nJustin's starting to have palpitations\n\n417\n00:23:02.132 --> 00:23:03.170\nover here.\n\n418\n00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.057\nHow do we ensure-\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n\n419\n00:23:06.057 --> 00:23:08.848\n&gt;&gt; That we've got consistency in our data,\n\n420\n00:23:08.848 --> 00:23:11.729\nand that we haven't got any duplication?\n\n421\n00:23:11.729 --> 00:23:16.500\nAnd if we've got duplicate sources of\ndata, which one is the accurate one?\n\n422\n00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:22.423\n&gt;&gt; Now we're having a discussion about\nsingle source of truth and that becomes-\n\n423\n00:23:22.423 --> 00:23:23.684\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n424\n00:23:23.684 --> 00:23:25.651\n&gt;&gt; Outside of the context of managerial\n\n425\n00:23:25.651 --> 00:23:29.976\npractices, that is a problem that I'm not\nsure anybody has the right answer to.\n\n426\n00:23:29.976 --> 00:23:31.006\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; As well.\n\n427\n00:23:31.006 --> 00:23:34.587\nI mean, obviously knowing where the data\nis coming from, knowing where it's going,\n\n428\n00:23:34.587 --> 00:23:37.778\nhaving appropriate standards about its\nprovidence and transformations and\n\n429\n00:23:37.778 --> 00:23:39.330\nthings like that.\n\n430\n00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:44.040\nIs helpful, but it still does not,\nif I find two conflicting records or\n\n431\n00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.430\nwhatever it may be, which one is right?\n\n432\n00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.960\nIs it the first one that came in or\nis it the second one?\n\n433\n00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.220\n&gt;&gt; I'm just distracted by what you're\ndoing with your hands by the way.\n\n434\n00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.593\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because in English that that's\n\n435\n00:23:53.593 --> 00:23:54.130\nquite rude.\n\n436\n00:23:56.061 --> 00:23:57.675\n&gt;&gt; Just saying.\n\n437\n00:23:57.675 --> 00:23:59.484\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm\n\n438\n00:23:59.484 --> 00:24:00.507\nculturally insensitive to who [LAUGH].\n\n439\n00:24:00.507 --> 00:24:01.803\n&gt;&gt; Now that I, yeah, I know.\n\n440\n00:24:01.803 --> 00:24:02.504\nNow that I've put him on the spot,\nbut you're right-\n\n441\n00:24:02.504 --> 00:24:05.546\n&gt;&gt; I should have went [NOISE].\n\n442\n00:24:05.546 --> 00:24:07.371\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n443\n00:24:07.371 --> 00:24:09.782\n&gt;&gt; But we do have that dilemma.\n\n444\n00:24:09.782 --> 00:24:15.710\nWe really, really do, and\noutside of the boundaries, as you say,\n\n445\n00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:21.950\nof service management this is\na dilemma that we have as architects.\n\n446\n00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:26.703\nWhen we are designing a storage system,\nor we're designing a database for\n\n447\n00:24:26.703 --> 00:24:29.494\nour data, it's a dilemma that we have, and\n\n448\n00:24:29.494 --> 00:24:33.970\nthat's why this flows into the data and\ninformation standards.\n\n449\n00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:39.484\nThis is another reason why you\nneed that service integrator role,\n\n450\n00:24:39.484 --> 00:24:43.920\nbecause you need to have\nsome standards to your data.\n\n451\n00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.410\nIf I've got five, six, seven, eight\nsuppliers, and they're all using parts\n\n452\n00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:52.967\nof my data, and more importantly, they\nare all inputting data into my services,\n\n453\n00:24:52.967 --> 00:24:56.820\nthey're not gonna make sure that\nthat happens to a standard.\n\n454\n00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:01.750\nI've got to make sure that I'm not getting\ndata from one source in one language,\n\n455\n00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.140\nand data from another source in\nanother language or in another format,\n\n456\n00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:11.310\nbecause then I'm then going to have to\ntranslate that at some point in time.\n\n457\n00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:18.850\nSo the disparity of our data sources\nis quite an important driver too,\n\n458\n00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:23.520\nand the other reason why we need SIAM,\nwell, look at tooling.\n\n459\n00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:28.970\nIf I have got five, six, seven,\neight different service providers,\n\n460\n00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:33.530\nI guarantee that maybe two of them,\nthree of them, at the most\n\n461\n00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:38.300\nare gonna be using the same call login\ntool or the same event management tool,\n\n462\n00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.750\nso there's gonna be at least two or\nthree of them that aren't.\n\n463\n00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.080\nAnd so if I don't have any way of managing\nthat, which is where this service\n\n464\n00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.920\nintegration role comes in, if I don't\nhave any way of managing that, then again\n\n465\n00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:54.088\nI'm gonna get all of my information from\nmy suppliers in different languages and\n\n466\n00:25:54.088 --> 00:25:59.250\nin different formats, and how am I\ngoing to assimilate that information?\n\n467\n00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:05.013\nHow are my going to ensure that when an\nincident is raised on the service desk and\n\n468\n00:26:05.013 --> 00:26:07.740\nit has four hour response time that that\n\n469\n00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.130\nincidence is then passed between\nall our service providers, and\n\n470\n00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:15.295\nthat service level target is still upheld,\nand more importantly,\n\n471\n00:26:15.295 --> 00:26:19.359\nit's still passed with the incidence\nonto all those service providers?\n\n472\n00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:21.990\nHow do I ensure that?\n\n473\n00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:25.770\nIt's a hypothetical question,\nI'm not expecting Justin to answer that.\n\n474\n00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:29.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, that's a good thing,\ncuz I was just like,\n\n475\n00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:34.410\nI mean even outside this context,\ntooling in general is always a point of\n\n476\n00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:38.800\ncontention, whether it's here,\nor in any other world.\n\n477\n00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.390\nThere's like wars.\n\n478\n00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.427\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Verbal wars, not literal wars.\n\n479\n00:26:42.427 --> 00:26:43.993\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Fought over, no this tool's the best,\n\n480\n00:26:43.993 --> 00:26:45.031\nthis tool's the best,-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n481\n00:26:45.031 --> 00:26:47.938\n&gt;&gt; And then we have,\nagain this kind of fragmentation, and\n\n482\n00:26:47.938 --> 00:26:51.290\nthen we all kind of throw up our hands,\nand go, I don't know.\n\n483\n00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:55.150\nIt came from here, it's in here,\nbut I didn't get that issue.\n\n484\n00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:57.300\n&gt;&gt; My tool is here better than yours,\nright, yeah [LAUGH].\n\n485\n00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.064\n&gt;&gt; It was almost cold sweat again Jo.\n\n486\n00:26:59.064 --> 00:26:59.846\nI was having flashbacks.\n\n487\n00:26:59.846 --> 00:27:01.435\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is,\n\n488\n00:27:01.435 --> 00:27:03.850\nit's my tool's better than yours,\nand what do we do?\n\n489\n00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:07.708\nWell that's why we've got that\nservice integration role,\n\n490\n00:27:07.708 --> 00:27:10.959\nthe service integrator,\nthat level that we have,\n\n491\n00:27:10.959 --> 00:27:15.740\nthat layer in the ecosystem,\nthat's the layer that makes the decisions.\n\n492\n00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:20.695\nThat's the layer that will sort that out,\nbecause if we've got\n\n493\n00:27:20.695 --> 00:27:25.214\ncontracts with our suppliers\nit has to be in our contract.\n\n494\n00:27:25.214 --> 00:27:30.808\nIt's not something that we can ignore,\nand again, if we don't have that in our\n\n495\n00:27:30.808 --> 00:27:36.500\ncontracts this is a driver or the reason\nwhy we want to implement the code system.\n\n496\n00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:41.116\nWe want to implement the service\nintegration layer, because if we don't,\n\n497\n00:27:41.116 --> 00:27:43.000\nwell, we've just got chaos.\n\n498\n00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.748\nSo that was our third driver, and our\nthird driver is operational efficiencies,\n\n499\n00:27:48.748 --> 00:27:53.244\nand by the way, so far,\nwe've looked at three drivers now, and\n\n500\n00:27:53.244 --> 00:27:56.242\nno one of those drivers gets priority, but\n\n501\n00:27:56.242 --> 00:28:01.154\nas you can see is we go through this\nparticular mini series as it where,\n\n502\n00:28:01.154 --> 00:28:07.340\nwithin SIAM foundation you can see that\nthese drivers are incredibly important.\n\n503\n00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:11.910\nAnd that these are the reasons why\nwe moved to the SIAM ecosystem, and\n\n504\n00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:17.680\nyeah I see this, this is a reality for\na lot of people in a lot of environments,\n\n505\n00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:23.390\nand this is something that, well,\nit causes a huge, big headache.\n\n506\n00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:24.640\nAnd as Justin's seeing,\n\n507\n00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.500\nit's causing a bigger headache than\nhe probably otherwise perceived.\n\n508\n00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.475\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's true for most everything.\n\n509\n00:28:30.475 --> 00:28:32.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're like it's simple,\n\n510\n00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:35.685\nuntil you actually start peeling back\nthe layers and then you go, I don't know,\n\n511\n00:28:35.685 --> 00:28:38.190\nthere's LEGOs here, and\nI have got to assemble them.\n\n512\n00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:43.089\nThis is like 6,000 piece jigsaw puzzle,\nand you were unprepared,\n\n513\n00:28:43.089 --> 00:28:46.864\nbut I think being upfront,\nand knowing about, I mean,\n\n514\n00:28:46.864 --> 00:28:51.683\nthese driving forces of why you would\nmove to this methodology it should\n\n515\n00:28:51.683 --> 00:28:56.335\nbring to light, I mean,\njust as it has with me in front you, yeah,\n\n516\n00:28:56.335 --> 00:28:59.830\nwell these are not things\nI consider in isolation.\n\n517\n00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:04.255\nThis one feeds into this, and so it's\nentirely complex, and I guess the only way\n\n518\n00:29:04.255 --> 00:29:08.306\nyou can deal with that complexity is,\nwell, to learn more, right, Jo?\n\n519\n00:29:08.306 --> 00:29:12.359\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, we've gotta learn more and\nwe've gotta see the big picture, and\n\n520\n00:29:12.359 --> 00:29:16.720\nI've always said I hate using cliches, but\nwe've gotta see absolutely everything.\n\n521\n00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:21.105\nAnd in our next episode, we're going to\nbe looking at external drivers, and we're\n\n522\n00:29:21.105 --> 00:29:25.613\ngonna be looking at commercial drivers as\nwell, and that, all of those five drivers,\n\n523\n00:29:25.613 --> 00:29:29.746\nare gonna give us, if we can see all of\nthem, it's gonna give us a big picture and\n\n524\n00:29:29.746 --> 00:29:33.252\nit's gonna help us identify\nthe relationships between them all.\n\n525\n00:29:33.252 --> 00:29:36.394\n&gt;&gt; Well, you should definitely join us,\nbecause, well, we're gonna see if\n\n526\n00:29:36.394 --> 00:29:39.192\nwe can bring this all together and\nstart to make sense of things, but\n\n527\n00:29:39.192 --> 00:29:41.845\nthe only way you're gonna do that\nis if you come on back with us.\n\n528\n00:29:41.845 --> 00:29:43.318\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n529\n00:29:43.318 --> 00:29:46.570\nSo signing off for ITPro.TV I've\nbeen your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n530\n00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:47.580\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n531\n00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.152\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n532\n00:29:48.152 --> 00:29:55.780\n[MUSIC]\n\n533\n00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.199\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:13.052\nwatching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone, and\n\n4\n00:00:13.052 --> 00:00:16.390\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.972\nI'm your host Justin Dennison,\n\n6\n00:00:17.972 --> 00:00:21.650\nand we're coming back at you with more\nof our mini series about SIAM drivers.\n\n7\n00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.270\nAnd this is part of our SIAM foundation\nseries, and well here to help us along to\n\n8\n00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.210\ntalk about external and\ncommercial drivers, is Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.250\nHow you doing today Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great.\n\n10\n00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.690\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic as well, and\n\n11\n00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.970\nI don't know during this little mini\nseries we've had, I've had ups and down.\n\n12\n00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.002\nSo I'm like,\nI kinda understand what you're saying.\n\n13\n00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:46.033\nAnd then, there's other times where\nI'm like never would have thought of\n\n14\n00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:46.920\nit that way.\n\n15\n00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.760\nBut over the past couple of episodes\nwe've talked about kind of these\n\n16\n00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.520\ndriving sources, the source landscape.\n\n17\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.600\nAnd now, we're coming to external and\ncommercialization, or commercial drivers.\n\n18\n00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.840\nAnd we bundle these two,\n\n19\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.860\nwhy do we bundle these two together?\n&gt;&gt; Well, so so\n\n20\n00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.420\nfar, we've looked at drivers such as,\n\n21\n00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.660\nthe drivers being the reason why we\nwant to implement the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n22\n00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.800\nSo we've looked to drivers such as\nsatisfaction, service satisfaction,\n\n23\n00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.390\ncustomer satisfaction.\n\n24\n00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.560\nWe've looked at drivers such as,\nyou mentioned source and landscapes.\n\n25\n00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.508\nAnd we've also looked at operational\nefficiencies and effectiveness.\n\n26\n00:01:24.508 --> 00:01:26.710\nAnd if you take a look at\nthe screen in front of you,\n\n27\n00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.760\nyou will see that when it\ncomes to external drivers, and\n\n28\n00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.650\nnow I'm just gonna change to\ncommercial drivers as well.\n\n29\n00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.110\nYou'll see that actually we've\ngot two factors for each one.\n\n30\n00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.890\nAnd the reason why we've bundled these\ntogether, well, is quite simply because of\n\n31\n00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.090\nthe length of time that we're gonna\nspend talking about these two drivers.\n\n32\n00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.380\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n33\n00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.030\nWe want to aim to keep our episodes\nat around about 30 minutes, and\n\n34\n00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.220\nwe can certainly discuss both\nof these within the 30 minutes.\n\n35\n00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.910\nThe other drivers were\na huge big influence\n\n36\n00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.590\non our decision to evolve\nto the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n37\n00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.680\nAnd so these drivers, they are still\na huge, big influence, but nevertheless,\n\n38\n00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.570\nthere's something that we can discuss\na little bit more efficiently,\n\n39\n00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.850\nshould we say, Justin?\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know Jo,\n\n40\n00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.640\nyou took the words right out of my mouth.\n\n41\n00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.340\nI was like, we did talk about\nefficiency to some extent.\n\n42\n00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.280\nWe're making an efficient decision when\ndiscussing these two respective things.\n\n43\n00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.490\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly, there you go.\n\n44\n00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.480\nSo let's take a look at the first one,\nand the first one is our external driver.\n\n45\n00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.290\nSo so far, in our last episode\nin this particular little\n\n46\n00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.430\nminiseries this sub series of drivers.\n\n47\n00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.380\nThe last episode,\nwe looked at operational efficiencies and\n\n48\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.560\noperational effectiveness.\n\n49\n00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.040\nAnd we looked at the influence of\nhaving multiple service providers, and\n\n50\n00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.310\nwe looked at so the things like data.\n\n51\n00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.331\nWhere do we store our data?\n\n52\n00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:58.772\nWe looked at other things like,\nhow do we manage, say,\n\n53\n00:02:58.772 --> 00:03:02.752\na process across all of\nthose service providers?\n\n54\n00:03:02.752 --> 00:03:04.840\nAnd how do we ensure consistency?\n\n55\n00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.140\nWe looked at having a cohesive\nprocess delivery, and\n\n56\n00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.320\nalso a cohesive service delivery.\n\n57\n00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.010\nAnd we looked at the contracts that exist,\nlegacy contracts, as well,\n\n58\n00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.020\nthat we talked about.\n\n59\n00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.840\nAnd all the clauses that are in\nthose legacy contracts, and\n\n60\n00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.720\ncontracts that are fairly inflexible, and\ncontracts that have been negotiated for\n\n61\n00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.300\nperiods of five years, etc.\n\n62\n00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.040\nSo actually, we did cover a lot of what\nwe're going to talk about now in terms of\n\n63\n00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.550\nthe external drivers.\n\n64\n00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.450\nA driver is a reason for doing something.\n\n65\n00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.970\nAnd so we've been discussing the drivers\nfor evolving to the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n66\n00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.990\nAnd as I've already mentioned in previous\nepisodes, we would be evolving, generally,\n\n67\n00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.130\nfrom an ITIL, or maybe from an ISO 20000\n\n68\n00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.715\nframework based management system,\nservice management\n\n69\n00:03:59.715 --> 00:04:04.840\nthrough to an ecosystem where we only\nincorporated multiple service providers.\n\n70\n00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.425\nAnd what are the reasons for doing that?\n\n71\n00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:10.940\nWell, one of them might simply be that\nthe organization itself has decided that\n\n72\n00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.770\nthat's what we're going to do, and\nthat would be corporate governance.\n\n73\n00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.477\nAnd corporate governance has said you\nknow what, and that's what we're doing.\n\n74\n00:04:19.477 --> 00:04:23.666\nAnd so in that instance then,\nwell, we've decided that,\n\n75\n00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:27.793\nI'll say we decided,\nwe don't have any decision at all here.\n\n76\n00:04:27.793 --> 00:04:30.970\n[LAUGH] The organization said,\nthis is what we're gonna do, and so\n\n77\n00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.080\ntherefore that's exactly\nwhat we're going to do.\n\n78\n00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.571\nAnd quite often,\n\n79\n00:04:35.571 --> 00:04:41.543\nwe don't get the opportunity then\nto just tell the organization, no.\n\n80\n00:04:41.543 --> 00:04:45.259\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is no democracy available,\n\n81\n00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:45.930\nright?\n\n82\n00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.280\nIt's, we made a decision.\n\n83\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.003\nWho's we?\n\n84\n00:04:49.003 --> 00:04:52.965\nWe as a corporation, which means\na small subset have made a decision for\n\n85\n00:04:52.965 --> 00:04:57.733\nyou that we're actually gonna move towards\nthis through this methodology, right?\n\n86\n00:04:57.733 --> 00:04:58.773\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and\n\n87\n00:04:58.773 --> 00:05:00.920\nwe just don't get any choice about it.\n\n88\n00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.260\nSo corporate governance is one big driver.\n\n89\n00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.100\nAnd sometimes corporate governance,\nby the way, changes over time.\n\n90\n00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.160\nAnd it might not have been corporate\ngovernance, at one point in time,\n\n91\n00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.410\nto move to SIAM.\n\n92\n00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.370\nIt might have been very simple.\n\n93\n00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.420\nWe might have kept to an ITIL methodology.\n\n94\n00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.850\nIt's your framework, because we kept\nto our internal service provider.\n\n95\n00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.970\nBut unfortunately things change, and I say\nunfortunately, I expect things to change.\n\n96\n00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.900\nAn organization that is not able to\nchange, and is not able to accommodate and\n\n97\n00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.600\nadapt to change, is an organization\nthat stagnates very, very quickly.\n\n98\n00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.405\nSo we also have another\nexternal driver here, and\n\n99\n00:05:41.405 --> 00:05:44.949\nby external, by the way,\nwe mean external to IT.\n\n100\n00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.945\nWe don't necessarily mean\nexternal to the organization.\n\n101\n00:05:47.945 --> 00:05:53.850\nIs external policy, now that does\nmean external to the organization.\n\n102\n00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.670\nSo an external policy is something that\nis from outside of the organization,\n\n103\n00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.620\noutside of the company, period.\n\n104\n00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.774\nCan you think of any\nexternal policies that\n\n105\n00:06:06.774 --> 00:06:07.492\nmight?\n&gt;&gt; I'm\n\n106\n00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:08.356\nguessing-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n107\n00:06:08.356 --> 00:06:08.982\n&gt;&gt; Like rules and\n\n108\n00:06:08.982 --> 00:06:12.688\nregulations that are handed down from some\nkind of government entities that you have\n\n109\n00:06:12.688 --> 00:06:15.660\nto conform to, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's exactly it, yeah.\n\n110\n00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.620\nWe're talking about legislation,\nwe're talking about regulations.\n\n111\n00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.150\nSo we're talking about things like,\n\n112\n00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.780\nin previous episodes we've\nmentioned recycling.\n\n113\n00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.330\nAnd recycling is mandatory in\nsome countries around the world.\n\n114\n00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.870\nIt's also mandatory in some\nstates in the US, as well.\n\n115\n00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.760\nSo we're talking about external\ninfluences that we cannot control,\n\n116\n00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.160\nand that we simply cannot influence.\n\n117\n00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.160\nLet's take, for instance, and\nI know that I've mentioned I've used\n\n118\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.160\nthe recycling as an example\nin previous episodes.\n\n119\n00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.530\nLet's talk about recycling for a moment.\n\n120\n00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.565\nIf we were to talk about the fact\nthat an organization recycles, and\n\n121\n00:06:54.565 --> 00:06:58.825\nin certain countries around the world\nthen recycling is mandatory.\n\n122\n00:06:58.825 --> 00:07:01.791\nAnd therefore,\nit's something that manufacturers do.\n\n123\n00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:04.505\nIt's something that your suppliers do.\n\n124\n00:07:04.505 --> 00:07:09.295\nAnd let's say we get a laptop from Dell,\nor HP, or from Lenovo.\n\n125\n00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:14.660\nThen when purchased a laptop from them,\n\n126\n00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:20.220\nthat we have a contract with them that\nthey will remove the old laptops,\n\n127\n00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.930\nand they will recycle them.\n\n128\n00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:22.740\nOkay, that's fine.\n\n129\n00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:30.165\nBut then here in the US, where it's\nnot mandatory, then Dell, HP, Lenovo,\n\n130\n00:07:30.165 --> 00:07:36.310\nAcer, whomever,\nmay not have the ability to recycle.\n\n131\n00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:42.187\nSo what we may have to do is we\nmay have to find another service\n\n132\n00:07:42.187 --> 00:07:47.375\nprovider to come along and\nperform that recycling.\n\n133\n00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:52.664\nAnd so that there will drive us\nto evolve to a SIAM ecosystem.\n\n134\n00:07:52.664 --> 00:07:55.887\nBecause yet again, we're bringing\nin another service provider.\n\n135\n00:07:55.887 --> 00:08:00.256\nIt's an external service provider that\nwill perform recycling duties for us.\n\n136\n00:08:00.256 --> 00:08:02.320\nBut we're bringing them\ninto the mix as well.\n\n137\n00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.010\nAnd so we have to ensure that we have\ngot not only consistency of process but\n\n138\n00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.940\nwe've also got to ensure\nthat we got relationships.\n\n139\n00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.070\nLet's face it, you don't want somebody\nturning up to take your old PC\n\n140\n00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.540\naway to be recycled a week before\nyour new one is due to arrive.\n\n141\n00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.140\nThough I mean you might do.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n142\n00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.680\n&gt;&gt; You might consider that to be some sort\n\n143\n00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.460\nof enforced time off or something.\n&gt;&gt; I'll be like\n\n144\n00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.630\nI got nothing to do.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n145\n00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.180\n&gt;&gt; I've got no computer here and\n\n146\n00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.095\nI've just been hanging out\nwith a little of my thumb.\n\n147\n00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.835\nSo maybe it is a forced vacation so\n\n148\n00:08:34.835 --> 00:08:37.005\nto speak.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, if somebody gave me\n\n149\n00:08:37.005 --> 00:08:41.615\na forced vacation, I think I'd be worried.\n&gt;&gt; I think that's called fired.\n\n150\n00:08:41.615 --> 00:08:42.977\n&gt;&gt; That's definitely in\n\n151\n00:08:42.977 --> 00:08:43.745\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n152\n00:08:43.745 --> 00:08:45.979\nYou can take some time off and\nnever come back.\n\n153\n00:08:45.979 --> 00:08:47.401\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Never come back.\n\n154\n00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:51.140\nSo we've got to think about this.\n\n155\n00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.770\nNot only does it not look too good when\nwe're giving somebody an enforced vacation\n\n156\n00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.320\nbecause we've taken their\nlaptop away from them, but\n\n157\n00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.350\nalso think about the productiveness and\nthink about their efficiency.\n\n158\n00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.550\nThey're not gonna be productive\nwhen we've done that.\n\n159\n00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.880\nAnd it creates a bit of a headache for us.\n\n160\n00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.600\nThere are issues that can occur, lots and\n\n161\n00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.970\nlots of issues and we have already looked\nat some of those, when we don't talk and\n\n162\n00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:20.620\nwhen we don't have the relationships\nin place between our service providers.\n\n163\n00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.550\nSo the more service providers\nthat we add into the mix then\n\n164\n00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:28.910\nthe more imperative it is for\nus to get those relationships right and\n\n165\n00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:33.040\nto actually be able to manage\nthose communication channels.\n\n166\n00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.950\nAnd that is the responsibility of\nthe service integrator, to manage\n\n167\n00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:43.760\nthose communication channels to make sure\nthat those relationships are in place.\n\n168\n00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.750\nSo these are examples of our external\ndrivers, external influences,\n\n169\n00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:54.620\ninfluences that will drive us to move to\n\n170\n00:09:54.620 --> 00:10:00.040\na SIAM ecosystem from another\nmanagement methodology or framework.\n\n171\n00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:07.212\nAnd the last set of drivers then, and\nlook at the CI director's fantastic.\n\n172\n00:10:07.212 --> 00:10:09.590\nI keep praising them\nbecause they're telepathic.\n\n173\n00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:14.850\nThey just do exactly as\nI've expecting them to do.\n\n174\n00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:18.240\nSo the last set of drivers\nthat we've got here\n\n175\n00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.970\nare these ones that\nare showing in front of us now.\n\n176\n00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.910\nThese are our service providers and\nour service integrators.\n\n177\n00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.140\nThis is a simple statement,\n\n178\n00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.920\nan incredibly simple statement\nwhen we look at these drivers.\n\n179\n00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.840\nBecause what we're saying is,\n\n180\n00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:37.040\nthat basically one of these has said that\nthey want us to move to a SIAM ecosystem.\n\n181\n00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.500\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n182\n00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.170\nAnd it may be that our service providers\n\n183\n00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.315\nare telling us that they\nare having trouble.\n\n184\n00:10:44.315 --> 00:10:49.130\nThey're experiencing difficulty\nin speaking with each other,\n\n185\n00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.290\nin relating to each other.\n\n186\n00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.990\nThat last comment that I made about it,\nensuring that we've got efficient and\n\n187\n00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.430\neffective communication and\n\n188\n00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:00.280\nabout having the relationships in\nplace between our service providers?\n\n189\n00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.290\nWell, there you go.\n\n190\n00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.920\nIt may be that our service providers\nare actually saying to themselves,\n\n191\n00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:05.630\nyou know what?\n\n192\n00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.080\nOr saying to us, you know,\nwe can't talk to each other.\n\n193\n00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.000\nWe cannot.\n\n194\n00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.160\nI cannot pass an incident on\nto another service provider.\n\n195\n00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.800\nI don't have the tools\nwith which to do so.\n\n196\n00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.100\nI don't have the mechanism\nwith which to do so.\n\n197\n00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:25.140\nOr rather, maybe we don't have\nthe service level targets set up that\n\n198\n00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:30.720\nallows me to do that and to be able\nto manage that particular incident.\n\n199\n00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.400\nSo in that instance is our service\nproviders that are generating that\n\n200\n00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.590\nrequest for\nus to move to a SIAM ecosystem.\n\n201\n00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:47.330\nFor us to get smarter at our management of\nthose providers, or maybe something else.\n\n202\n00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.230\nAnd it may not just be a request for\nenhanced relationships but\n\n203\n00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.260\nit may be a complaint.\n\n204\n00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:58.530\nAnd it may be that, and Justin is rolling\nhis eyes now, but it may be a complaint.\n\n205\n00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:04.430\nIt may be that one of our services feels\nas though another service provider is not\n\n206\n00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.390\nreally giving them\nthe support that they need or\n\n207\n00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.550\nis not fulfilling their contract perhaps.\n\n208\n00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:15.354\nAnd that it's causing them to fail\non their service level targets.\n\n209\n00:12:15.354 --> 00:12:19.660\nYou know I've passed this to somebody\nelse for them to take a look at, and\n\n210\n00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.790\nunfortunately because they fail\ntheir service level target,\n\n211\n00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:27.060\nI'm now failing my service\nlevel target as a result.\n\n212\n00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.300\nSo it may be a complaint.\n\n213\n00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.370\nSo our service providers\ncan be a driver themselves.\n\n214\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.000\nThey can influence our desire and\n\n215\n00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.190\nour need to move to better management,\n\n216\n00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:44.400\nmore efficient management,\nof those providers en masse, as a whole.\n\n217\n00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.910\nAnd then you've got our\nservice integrators.\n\n218\n00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.020\nThey're a service integrator.\n\n219\n00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.670\nOf course that's that middle\nlayer in that SIAM ecosystem,\n\n220\n00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:57.990\nthe layer between the customer and\nthe service provider.\n\n221\n00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:02.290\nAnd it may be that that layer there, maybe\nthat's our internal IT department for\n\n222\n00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.420\ninstance.\n\n223\n00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:08.860\nThey want to have better visibility\nacross all service providers.\n\n224\n00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:15.070\nThey want to have better cohesion across\nall of our service providers and enhanced\n\n225\n00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:20.740\ncollaboration and a consistency in the way\nof working across our service providers.\n\n226\n00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:25.740\nMaybe we want to implement standard\ncontract across our service providers,\n\n227\n00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.980\nwe want our service providers\nto talk to each other.\n\n228\n00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:34.250\nAnd therefore,\nwe want to move to a SIAM ecosystem,\n\n229\n00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:39.660\na way of managing our service providers\nthat allows us to deliver value to\n\n230\n00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:47.180\nthe customer and not be completely,\nwell, in chaos all of the time.\n\n231\n00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.340\nYou're thinking Justin,\n\n232\n00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.870\nhe's got that face on again.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n233\n00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.150\nI'm thinking that there's\na couple of questions here.\n\n234\n00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:56.720\nthe service providers that are kinda\ngiving us this driving force.\n\n235\n00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.350\nThose could be either external or internal\nservice providers but is it more likely\n\n236\n00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.276\nlike they're one versus the other?\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily,\n\n237\n00:14:04.276 --> 00:14:06.820\nit really depends on\nthe setup that we've got.\n\n238\n00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:11.852\nSo if we've got an internal service desk,\nand that service desk are feeling that\n\n239\n00:14:11.852 --> 00:14:17.310\nthey're not getting the support from\nexternal second and third level support.\n\n240\n00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.320\nThen maybe the service\ndesk is driving that.\n\n241\n00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.600\nBut if the service desk is external,\nthey could still be\n\n242\n00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.900\nfeeling exactly the same thing and\nthey may not be getting the support.\n\n243\n00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.780\nBut of course then the driver would come\nfrom them, and they would be external.\n\n244\n00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.630\nSo there's no right or\nwrong, really, there.\n\n245\n00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.920\nI wouldn't say that one is\ngreater than the other.\n\n246\n00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.610\nLet's go with the human instinct,\n[LAUGH] and\n\n247\n00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:45.950\nwe're more likely to listen to\nan internal service provider?\n\n248\n00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:46.950\nShould I say that?\n\n249\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.530\nIs it the politically\ncorrect thing to say?\n\n250\n00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.460\nNo, but it's maybe the most\nrealistic thing to say.\n\n251\n00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.760\nWe're more likely to listen\nto an internal Team, or\n\n252\n00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.570\nan internal service provider\nwho is saying to us, hey look,\n\n253\n00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:02.280\nwe're not getting the co-operation\nfrom other people externally.\n\n254\n00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:07.790\nBut then, this is why we have KPIs, we've\nlooked at these in previous episodes,\n\n255\n00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.170\nthis is why we have process forums.\n\n256\n00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:13.450\nAnd these process forums\nwill be analyzing those KPIs\n\n257\n00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:17.090\nthat come out of the SLAM charts, the Bag\ncharts, the red and the green charts.\n\n258\n00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.170\nAnd they will be analyzing those KPIs.\n\n259\n00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:25.430\nAnd they will be identifying where we are\nmeeting our key performance indicators,\n\n260\n00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.960\nand where we have got room for\nimprovement.\n\n261\n00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.390\nSo no matter where it comes from,\nwhether it's internal or\n\n262\n00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:38.174\nexternal, I expect us to have\nthe KPIs to demonstrate that there\n\n263\n00:15:38.174 --> 00:15:42.692\nhas been a decrease in performance or\nthat there is an issue,\n\n264\n00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:47.327\nno matter where it's from.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense cuz I was like,\n\n265\n00:15:47.327 --> 00:15:52.149\n[SOUND] and I think by human nature,\nmy initial instinct was internal service\n\n266\n00:15:52.149 --> 00:15:56.920\nproviders are more likely to spur along\nchange just because of the nature.\n\n267\n00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.214\nWe know them, we can trust them, but\n\n268\n00:15:59.214 --> 00:16:04.030\nthat's not to say that There are maybe\nin most of your services are external.\n\n269\n00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.491\nAnd you still rely on all\nof those individuals.\n\n270\n00:16:07.491 --> 00:16:12.441\nThe service integrator thing though and\nthis may be due to my ignorance.\n\n271\n00:16:12.441 --> 00:16:14.552\nRight calling a spade a spade.\n\n272\n00:16:14.552 --> 00:16:17.392\n.&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If they are the ones spurring\n\n273\n00:16:17.392 --> 00:16:23.186\nthe movement I guess they exist as part of\nthe evolution from this large hierarchy.\n\n274\n00:16:23.186 --> 00:16:25.202\n&gt;&gt; multi source external one, or\n\n275\n00:16:25.202 --> 00:16:29.878\nmulti source, excuse me,\nnot just external, but just multi source.\n\n276\n00:16:29.878 --> 00:16:35.629\nThey kinda come into the mix and\nthen drive further evolution or\n\n277\n00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:38.980\nam I misunderstanding that?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n278\n00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.820\nand there's a reason why\nI use the word evolution,\n\n279\n00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:46.640\nbecause invariably moving to this\necosystem is never a conscious decision.\n\n280\n00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:52.410\nWhat's actually happened is generally we\nhave got an internal service provider,\n\n281\n00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:53.100\nwe've got IT.\n\n282\n00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.000\nAnd we realize that we can't do everything\n\n283\n00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.620\nwithin IT to meet the needs\nof the organization.\n\n284\n00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.860\nSo what we'll do is we might bring\non some external contract staff, or\n\n285\n00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:07.210\nwe might go to an external organization\nand say can you help with this?\n\n286\n00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.690\nAnd we'll go to another organization and\nsay can you help with this element?\n\n287\n00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.730\nAnd then we go to another organization\nsaying can you help with this, and\n\n288\n00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:14.910\ncan you provide that.\n\n289\n00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.940\nAnd then there's a strategic decision made\nat the steering group that says okay,\n\n290\n00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.090\nwe're gonna move to a software\nas a service approach for\n\n291\n00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:23.580\nour email service etc.\n\n292\n00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.580\nAnd so this is an evolution,\n\n293\n00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.550\nthis is not a conscious decision\nto bring in a service integrator.\n\n294\n00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:33.510\nAnd what actually happens is\nthat the internal IT team,\n\n295\n00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:38.530\nthey evolve and\nbecome the service integrator layer.\n\n296\n00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:43.100\nInadvertently almost, it's not\nreally always a conscious decision.\n\n297\n00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:48.780\nAnd in fact lemme talk about the drivers\nto move to the SIAM ecosystem,\n\n298\n00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:54.830\nit's generally borne out of a sudden\nrealization that we're already there,\n\n299\n00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.530\nbut we're just not\nachieving things very well.\n\n300\n00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:03.380\nYeah, that sounds a little bit ambiguous\nbut we're already in this position.\n\n301\n00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.600\nWe've already got lots of\ndifferent service providers.\n\n302\n00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.489\nBut it's just that the people that\nare in house, the people that we started\n\n303\n00:18:11.489 --> 00:18:16.457\noff with originally, the original\ninternal IT service provider is just not\n\n304\n00:18:16.457 --> 00:18:20.727\nparticularly good at managing\nthe external service providers.\n\n305\n00:18:20.727 --> 00:18:24.842\nAnd they've, by default,\nbecome that service integrator.\n\n306\n00:18:24.842 --> 00:18:27.460\nThey have become that middle layer.\n\n307\n00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.715\nThey didn't ask for that job.\n\n308\n00:18:28.715 --> 00:18:32.340\n[LAUGH] They didn't realize\nthey were doing that job.\n\n309\n00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.980\nThey just evolved to the fact\nthat they are doing that job.\n\n310\n00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:40.290\nSo that's how we've ended up,\nwith an internal service integrator.\n\n311\n00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.710\nIt's not a conscious decision.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and that's what I expected\n\n312\n00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:47.200\nbecause I was like, wait a minute, that\nseems like a cart before the horse thing.\n\n313\n00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.530\nBut as you're kind of like morphing and\nmolding, I think it's almost like this\n\n314\n00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:58.390\namoeboid kind of moving along,\nthen the IT team may become that layer.\n\n315\n00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:02.380\nI just wanna make sure, they may not\nnecessarily stay that layer, right?\n\n316\n00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.740\nThere maybe a more conscious effort\nof saying, we wanna go full bore.\n\n317\n00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.100\nAnd maybe we need to do some\nadditional restructuring,\n\n318\n00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.220\nis that correct assumption?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, and\n\n319\n00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:16.785\nthe reason why I hesitated is because\nI don't want people to be frightened.\n\n320\n00:19:16.785 --> 00:19:21.140\n[LAUGH] You know, I don't want people to\nthink, I've had people walking around\n\n321\n00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.610\nthe office and they started talking about\nSIAM, that means I'm gonna lose my job.\n\n322\n00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:26.910\nNo, that's not the case at all.\n\n323\n00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:32.750\nThis SIAM isn't evolution,\nit's exactly as you've described it there.\n\n324\n00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.710\nWe started off with, and\nwe always start off, by the way,\n\n325\n00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:40.820\nwith a very immature IT operation,\nvery, very immature.\n\n326\n00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:45.760\nAnd then it evolves over time, and\nthen we realize that actually because IT\n\n327\n00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:51.090\nbecomes no longer,\nit's no longer that evil necessity.\n\n328\n00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:55.350\nThat thing that sits in the corner that\nwe've got to have, but we don't like.\n\n329\n00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.310\nIT suddenly becomes\nan integral part of our life.\n\n330\n00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.780\nAnd when you actually think about it,\n\n331\n00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:04.640\nfrom the minute you park your car in\nthat parking lot or in that car park,\n\n332\n00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.750\nthe minute you park your car,\nor maybe even before then,\n\n333\n00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:13.180\nmaybe you've had to use an access\nto get into your parking space.\n\n334\n00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.520\nYou may have had to use\na keycard to do that.\n\n335\n00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.934\nSo before you even walk in the door,\n\n336\n00:20:17.934 --> 00:20:23.660\nIT has become an essential part of your\nbusiness life, your business environment.\n\n337\n00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:30.260\nAnd so because of that, the number of\nservice providers that we have within IT,\n\n338\n00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:36.560\nhas naturally evolved over the last\nhowever years 20,30 years.\n\n339\n00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.300\nSo getting to this point\nis just an evolution.\n\n340\n00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.250\nIt's not a conscious decision.\n\n341\n00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:46.190\nAnd that doesn't mean that we're going to\ntherefore naturally outsource everything.\n\n342\n00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:50.490\nThat's gonna be our next step is that\nthat service integration layer is then\n\n343\n00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:51.460\ngoing to be outsourced.\n\n344\n00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.050\nThat's not the case at all.\n\n345\n00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.990\nSometimes we retain service\nintegration in house.\n\n346\n00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:00.980\nSometimes we outsource it, and\nthere's no right or wrong.\n\n347\n00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:04.230\nIt depends on the environment itself, and\n\n348\n00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.650\nit depends on whether the organizations\nwants to get out of that.\n\n349\n00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:12.461\nWe always talk about putting your eggs in\none basket, and if we were to go outside,\n\n350\n00:21:12.461 --> 00:21:15.349\nand we'll explore this\nin some later episodes.\n\n351\n00:21:15.349 --> 00:21:17.884\nBut if we were to go outside and\ngo external and\n\n352\n00:21:17.884 --> 00:21:20.755\nlook for an external service integrator,\nit may be\n\n353\n00:21:20.755 --> 00:21:25.327\nthat you are putting all your eggs in one\nbasket and that leaves us with no choice.\n\n354\n00:21:25.327 --> 00:21:28.362\nBecause once you've signed\na contract with somebody,\n\n355\n00:21:28.362 --> 00:21:31.890\nit's not necessarily that\neasy to get out of it.\n\n356\n00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:36.380\nUltimately the drivers that we have,\nand over the last few episodes,\n\n357\n00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:42.010\nwe've looked at the drivers to get\nto this particular point in time.\n\n358\n00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:47.360\nThe driver is to get to the ecosystem,\nto evolve through to the ecosystem.\n\n359\n00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:52.590\nThese drivers have probably happened\ntransparently, in the background.\n\n360\n00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:57.120\nIt's possibly not something\nthat's been visible to you,\n\n361\n00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.630\nsomething that you've been aware of.\n\n362\n00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:03.190\nWe've kind of got there and\nwe didn't realize that we were there.\n\n363\n00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:08.280\nAnd we kind of adopted this, but\nwe didn't realize that we were doing it.\n\n364\n00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:14.060\nAnd the drivers will be\na unique combination for\n\n365\n00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.820\nabsolutely every individual organization.\n\n366\n00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.540\nThere aren't any two\norganizations the same,\n\n367\n00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.160\neven within the same industry sector.\n\n368\n00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.140\nThe drivers are never ever\ngoing to be the same.\n\n369\n00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.160\n&gt;&gt; So from here on out,\n\n370\n00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.700\nI guess we're finished with drivers and\n\n371\n00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.760\nnow where are we going next Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n372\n00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.860\nwe've looked at,\nin this sort of little miniseries,\n\n373\n00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:43.900\nwe've looked at the reasons why we want\nto evolve through to the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n374\n00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.050\nAnd now what we're going to do is\nwe're gonna take a look at the actual\n\n375\n00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:48.330\nbusiness case itself.\n\n376\n00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:54.470\nBecause with any improvement initiative,\nwith any implementation and\n\n377\n00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:58.250\nwith any evolution we have to\nobviously have the funds and\n\n378\n00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:00.700\nthe justification to be able to do that.\n\n379\n00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:06.014\nSo we still have to have a business case\nin order to bring in a SIAM ecosystem,\n\n380\n00:23:06.014 --> 00:23:10.018\nin order to be able to bring in\na SIAM framework as it were.\n\n381\n00:23:10.018 --> 00:23:12.450\nWe have to have the business case for\nthat.\n\n382\n00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:16.900\nSo now that we've looked at the drivers,\nnow what we've got to do is we've got to\n\n383\n00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:22.240\nquantify those drivers in terms of\nthe relative value to the organization.\n\n384\n00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.190\nAnd so that's what we'll be\nlooking at in our next episode.\n\n385\n00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:26.900\n&gt;&gt; Well, I heard the word quantify and\n\n386\n00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.380\nI do like numbers so I'm kind of\ninterested to see how we quantify these\n\n387\n00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:35.380\nrespective drivers and where that leads\nus as far as ultimate decisions, right?\n\n388\n00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.200\nAnd hopefully you are interested as well,\nso definitely come on back.\n\n389\n00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.970\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n390\n00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:43.010\nSo, signing out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n391\n00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:43.920\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo peacock.\n\n392\n00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.499\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n393\n00:23:44.499 --> 00:23:52.122\n[MUSIC]\n\n394\n00:23:52.122 --> 00:23:56.909\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.440\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and welcome back\nto another excting episode of ITPro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.990\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and we're\ncontinuing on with SIAM foundation and\n\n7\n00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.390\nin particular we're gonna be\nlooking at the business case.\n\n8\n00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.310\nI think this is the meat and\npotatoes for actually using SIAM and\n\n9\n00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.020\nhere to help us along with that\nvery endeavor is Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.650\nHow you doing today Jo?\n\n11\n00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.000\n&gt;&gt; Well, what if you're vegetarian?\n\n12\n00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.680\n&gt;&gt; Then just potatoes.\n\n13\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.220\n&gt;&gt; No gravy or anything like that?\n\n15\n00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.140\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\nJust potatoes.\n\n16\n00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.980\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.460\n&gt;&gt; I was always told when I\n\n18\n00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.370\nwas a kid that potatoes can't\nbe considered to be a vegetable.\n\n19\n00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.250\nJust saying.\n\n20\n00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.580\nWe are, we're not gonna be looking at\nmeat and potatoes or vegetables for\n\n21\n00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.900\nthat matter in this particular episode.\n\n22\n00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.670\nWe're actually going to evaluate\nthe business case for evolving to,\n\n23\n00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.180\nand implementing, SIAM.\n\n24\n00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.430\nNow, we will talk in subsequent episodes,\n\n25\n00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.890\nas you watch the next few episodes,\nwe're gonna talk about the SIAM road map.\n\n26\n00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.740\nThe SIAM road map is really\nthe implementation road map.\n\n27\n00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.960\nIt's the activities that we have to\ngo through in order to implement\n\n28\n00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.220\na SIAM ecosystem.\n\n29\n00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.560\nBut first of all, we've got to\nwork out what our drivers are.\n\n30\n00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.210\nWe did that, and we did a little\nmini series on that, in fact.\n\n31\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.090\nAnd so we looked at all of our\ndrivers in our previous few episodes.\n\n32\n00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.930\nOur drivers are the reasons\nwhy we implement SIAM.\n\n33\n00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.290\nAnd now,\nwe're going to look at the business case.\n\n34\n00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.340\nNow, any idea what\na business case is Justin?\n\n35\n00:01:45.458 --> 00:01:47.070\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not Jo.\n\n36\n00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.410\nI'm not much of a business person, so\n\n37\n00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.180\nI'm not even going to think\nthat I have any inkling.\n\n38\n00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.960\n&gt;&gt; He didn't even go with it's\na document or anything like that.\n\n39\n00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.960\nIt's-\n&gt;&gt; No no no.\n\n40\n00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.490\nRight, we're in the new age here.\n\n41\n00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.106\nIt's probably some kind of\nlike a key fob or something.\n\n42\n00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:04.697\nI don't know.\n\n43\n00:02:04.697 --> 00:02:07.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's just a sticker.\n\n44\n00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.080\n[LAUGH] Basically this case is,\nwhat is known as the justification for\n\n45\n00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.660\nsignificant item or expenditure.\n\n46\n00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.200\nIt's generally a document,\nnot the key fob.\n\n47\n00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.900\nIt's generally a document that really\noutlines the benefits of undertaking\n\n48\n00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.890\na certain activity, or the benefits\nof implementing a certain activity.\n\n49\n00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.670\nThen, before we get going on\ntalking about business cases,\n\n50\n00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.264\nI just wanna make it clear that we do\nnot compilate formal business case for\n\n51\n00:02:36.264 --> 00:02:38.877\nabsolutely every decision that we make.\n\n52\n00:02:40.688 --> 00:02:41.300\nOr do we?\n\n53\n00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.220\nWell, we do, we do have justification for\nevery decision that we make.\n\n54\n00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.830\nAnd we need to have justification.\n\n55\n00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.960\nAnd we've looked at this in previous\nepisodes where we've looked at\n\n56\n00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.730\nthe benefits of implementing SIAM,\nor a SIAM sort of ecosystem.\n\n57\n00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.370\nBut then we also looked at\njustification in as much as if you want\n\n58\n00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.220\nto overcome resistance,\nthat's organizational change management.\n\n59\n00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.650\nIf you wanna overcome resistance\n\n60\n00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.580\nthen what you've got to do is\nyou've got to explain why.\n\n61\n00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.130\nYou've got to answer the question,\nwhat's in it for me?\n\n62\n00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.720\nAnd so\na business case is simply a justification.\n\n63\n00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.740\nAnd I expect the contents of\nthe business case to reflect\n\n64\n00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.380\nthe scope and the scale of what\nit is you're trying to achieve.\n\n65\n00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.150\nSo if you are undertaking\na very small improvement,\n\n66\n00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.680\nthen your business case may\nsimply just be a justification,\n\n67\n00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.030\nan assessment, in the RFC, Request for\nChange, the change record.\n\n68\n00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:53.410\nBut for a large scale implementation, such\nas evolving to the SIAM ecostructure and\n\n69\n00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.090\nall of the work that that's going to\nentail, and all of the processes etc.\n\n70\n00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:07.380\nAnd I don't expect to see a business case,\na formal business case document produced.\n\n71\n00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.560\n&gt;&gt; So, Jo, that does beg the question in\nwe're talking about these business cases,\n\n72\n00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.430\nwho's actually making these decisions\nkinda signing off on these?\n\n73\n00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.875\n&gt;&gt; Well, what do you think?\n\n74\n00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:21.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Are we a little bit of [INAUDIBLE].\n\n75\n00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I had to yeah how to answer\na question with a question right.\n\n76\n00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:34.020\nThe business case is signed off by\nthe steering group, the IT steering group.\n\n77\n00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.510\nNow sometimes and\nespecially in SIAM eco-structure\n\n78\n00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.960\nthen the steering group could be\npart of the service integrator or\n\n79\n00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.170\nthe steering group could be part\nof the customer depends on whether\n\n80\n00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.580\nthe service integrator is actually\ninternal or whether they're external.\n\n81\n00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.780\nBut bearing in mind that we're looking\nat the business case to implement\n\n82\n00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.000\na SIAM ecosystem in which case\n\n83\n00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.730\nthen that particular business case is\nsigned off by this steering group.\n\n84\n00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.200\nI am gonna ask you a question though.\n\n85\n00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.290\nOkay.\n\n86\n00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.155\nDo you think this steering group\nare technical or non-technical?\n\n87\n00:05:14.101 --> 00:05:16.800\n&gt;&gt; Decisions, decisions.\n\n88\n00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.810\nIt would make sense for\nme to actually be composed of both sides,\n\n89\n00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.720\nof technical and\nnon-technical individuals.\n\n90\n00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.950\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n91\n00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, really.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n92\n00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.770\n&gt;&gt; We need multiple perspectives on this.\n\n93\n00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe're talking steering group, though.\n\n94\n00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.370\nWe're talking senior\nmanagement making decisions.\n\n95\n00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.444\n&gt;&gt; Then I'm gonna say non-technical.\n\n96\n00:05:37.444 --> 00:05:38.008\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n97\n00:05:38.008 --> 00:05:40.770\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you.\n\n98\n00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.030\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; You said senior management,\n\n99\n00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.820\nI was like, just a nerd non-tech.\n\n100\n00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.160\nAnd I'm making a broad\ngeneralization here.\n\n101\n00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.930\nThey very well may be technical.\n\n102\n00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.360\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nI am not expecting it.\n\n103\n00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.820\nDepends on the organization.\n\n104\n00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.950\nBut I am not expecting my senior\nmanagement to be technical.\n\n105\n00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.460\nThey may have been, once upon a time, and\n\n106\n00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.970\nI expect them to have\na technical understanding.\n\n107\n00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.850\nDon't get me wrong I expect\nthem to be able to you know, to\n\n108\n00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.160\nbe able to pick up something that's fairly\ntechnical and to be able to understand it.\n\n109\n00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.350\nHowever you know, senior management\n\n110\n00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.120\nI don't expect to be involved in\nparticularly technical details.\n\n111\n00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.740\nThis is really a case of\nthe senior management.\n\n112\n00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.400\nI'm expecting for somebody to bring\nme a document that says okay,\n\n113\n00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.880\nthese are the benefits of undertaking\nthis particular exercise.\n\n114\n00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.080\nThen I'm gonna make\na decision based on that.\n\n115\n00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.130\nThis is not me making a decision\non any sort of technicalities.\n\n116\n00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:37.810\nThis is not me making a decision based\non specific service providers and\n\n117\n00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:43.190\nthe technical skills that they\ncan provide us, necessarily.\n\n118\n00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.120\nI expect my steering group,\nI expect, as a senior manager,\n\n119\n00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:53.900\nI expect to be making a decision based on\nthe recommendation of my technical team.\n\n120\n00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.470\nMy technical team should be able to\nrecommend for me and I should be able to\n\n121\n00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.660\ntrust them as a senior manager that they\ncan make those recommendations for me.\n\n122\n00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.340\n&gt;&gt; So Jo that begs the question,\nwhat's in a business case?\n\n123\n00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.143\n&gt;&gt; Watch.\n[SOUND]\n\n124\n00:07:07.143 --> 00:07:07.643\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n125\n00:07:07.643 --> 00:07:09.820\n&gt;&gt; Hey look at that see.\n\n126\n00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:10.520\n&gt;&gt; Magic.\n\n127\n00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.400\n&gt;&gt; I am yeah I know.\n\n128\n00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.585\nRight at my fingertips.\n\n129\n00:07:13.585 --> 00:07:16.930\n[LAUGH] What I've got here\non the screen in front of\n\n130\n00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.940\nyou is just really some examples of\nthe contents of a business case.\n\n131\n00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.580\nI've already that a business\ncase is just a justification for\n\n132\n00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.330\na significant item of expenditure.\n\n133\n00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.790\nAnd so that justification needs to contain\n\n134\n00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.940\nexamples like the cost savings for\nimplementing SIAM.\n\n135\n00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.610\nWell, the types of cost that\nwere are going to spend.\n\n136\n00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.360\nThe return on investment,\nthe value on investment\n\n137\n00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.630\nalso the influencing factors as well and\nthose drivers.\n\n138\n00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.747\nThey need to be mentioned\nin the business case too.\n\n139\n00:07:49.747 --> 00:07:54.488\nIt's the drivers that are gonna\nsway the decision that's being made\n\n140\n00:07:54.488 --> 00:07:56.430\nby the steering group.\n\n141\n00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.032\nIt's those drivers that\nare those influencing factors.\n\n142\n00:08:00.032 --> 00:08:02.045\nThat the student group\nare going to consider.\n\n143\n00:08:02.045 --> 00:08:04.670\nBecause it's a justification for\nexpenditure,\n\n144\n00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.979\nwhich means that we are actually going to\nbe spending money which means that we've\n\n145\n00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:12.727\ngot to demonstrate that we're gonna\nget a return on that investment and\n\n146\n00:08:12.727 --> 00:08:15.610\nthere's gotta be a reason for\nspending money.\n\n147\n00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.941\nI mean, I don't know about you but\nwhenever I went to, well,\n\n148\n00:08:18.941 --> 00:08:22.612\nanybody in my life and\never said can I have some money, please?\n\n149\n00:08:22.612 --> 00:08:25.860\nWell the answer that I've always\ngot is just a question, why?\n\n150\n00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:31.988\n[LAUGH] Sometimes because\nis not a sufficient answer.\n\n151\n00:08:31.988 --> 00:08:36.305\n&gt;&gt; I've not found that to\nbe an appropriate response.\n\n152\n00:08:36.305 --> 00:08:38.160\nBecause have never gotten me a loan.\n\n153\n00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.254\nBut-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n154\n00:08:40.254 --> 00:08:41.159\n&gt;&gt;

Well, I can't say that I can speak\nto how significant that expenditure is,\n\n318\n00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.910\nbut I wanna make sure that\nI have all of this right.\n\n319\n00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.950\nYou've created this justification for\nimplementing SIAM.\n\n320\n00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:10.135\nAnd you're saying, here are the targets\nthat I'm trying to meet, but\n\n321\n00:19:10.135 --> 00:19:13.413\nI can't actually give you how\nwell that has come along,\n\n322\n00:19:13.413 --> 00:19:16.728\nuntil I look at this from\na retrospective perspective.\n\n323\n00:19:16.728 --> 00:19:20.850\nAfter it has been done,\ndid I meet my goals?\n\n324\n00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.095\nAnd this is all kind of compiled.\n\n325\n00:19:23.095 --> 00:19:25.301\nPart of that is not the business case,\nI realize that.\n\n326\n00:19:25.301 --> 00:19:28.434\nBut I just wanna make sure,\nthe overarching kind of process,\n\n327\n00:19:28.434 --> 00:19:30.855\nthe thought process for,\nI'm justifying it.\n\n328\n00:19:30.855 --> 00:19:33.321\nHere's what I hope to see,\nhere's why it's important,\n\n329\n00:19:33.321 --> 00:19:35.548\nhere are the benefits that\nwe're gonna get from it.\n\n330\n00:19:35.548 --> 00:19:40.305\nAnd then we'll know if we've actually\nmet those benefits after this has all\n\n331\n00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:42.240\nwent down, right?\n\n332\n00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.360\n&gt;&gt; Let me bring something else into this,\nokay?\n\n333\n00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.768\nWhere do you go when you\nwanna know something?\n\n334\n00:19:51.194 --> 00:19:52.773\n&gt;&gt; To my mommy.\n\n335\n00:19:52.773 --> 00:19:55.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n336\n00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.806\n&gt;&gt; Speechless, okay,\n\n337\n00:19:56.806 --> 00:20:00.273\nthat's the first person that's\nrendered me speechless.\n\n338\n00:20:00.273 --> 00:20:04.824\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what to say to that now.\n\n339\n00:20:04.824 --> 00:20:10.757\nAll right, so,\nnow you compose yourself, Justin.\n\n340\n00:20:10.757 --> 00:20:12.530\nLet's say mommy's not around.\n\n341\n00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.040\nShe's not answering the phone.\n\n342\n00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.250\nShe's talking to your auntie for\nsome reason.\n\n343\n00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.524\nWhere else would you go if\nyou wanted to know something?\n\n344\n00:20:19.524 --> 00:20:21.320\nI was dreading the answer to that one now.\n\n345\n00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.220\nSorry, what was that?\n\n346\n00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:23.890\n&gt;&gt; The Internet.\n\n347\n00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.340\n&gt;&gt; The Internet, right,\nokay, kind of lost my train.\n\n348\n00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.983\nThe Internet is actually\na really good place to go.\n\n349\n00:20:32.983 --> 00:20:36.939\nIf you wanna see how other\npeople have done it,\n\n350\n00:20:36.939 --> 00:20:42.417\nif you wanna see what other people\nhave used as justification and\n\n351\n00:20:42.417 --> 00:20:47.200\nas demonstrated returns,\nthen go to the Internet.\n\n352\n00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.894\nDon't forget that the SIAM ecosystem\ncomes from the government, and as such,\n\n353\n00:20:51.894 --> 00:20:53.786\nunder freedom of information,\n\n354\n00:20:53.786 --> 00:20:57.585\nthere is a lot of information that\nis available on the Internet.\n\n355\n00:20:57.585 --> 00:21:01.008\nWe'll demonstrate a lot of white papers,\netc,\n\n356\n00:21:01.008 --> 00:21:06.187\nthat will demonstrate how different\norganizations in different sectors\n\n357\n00:21:06.187 --> 00:21:11.640\nhave achieved a return on that investment\nof implementing a SIAM ecosystem.\n\n358\n00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.090\nAgain, your organization is never going\nto be identical to anybody else's.\n\n359\n00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:21.200\nBut you may be able to find something\nout there that is from another or\n\n360\n00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.619\nsimilar industry sector or maybe a similar\norganization of a similar size to yours.\n\n361\n00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.390\nThe Internet is a fantastic resource.\n\n362\n00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:35.390\nWe have to bear in mind that the Internet\nis only ever somebody else's opinion, but\n\n363\n00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:37.340\nnevertheless, it's a fantastic resource.\n\n364\n00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.930\nAnd that will certainly help you compile\nthe contents of your business case.\n\n365\n00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.480\nNow, whether your mother will be able to\nhelp me with that one, I've never met her,\n\n366\n00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.310\nso I couldn't really say, to be honest.\n\n367\n00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.080\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know if she would\nbe able to help me because there\n\n368\n00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.020\nare parts of this that are just\nnow becoming clear for me.\n\n369\n00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.120\nSo we've talked about\nthe business case itself, but\n\n370\n00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.580\nwhere are we kind of going from here?\n\n371\n00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.470\nRight, we had this compiling\nthis justification of\n\n372\n00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.700\nwhy we should care about SIAM.\n\n373\n00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.010\nWhat's the next steps?\n\n374\n00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:09.016\n&gt;&gt; Well, the next step is we're gonna\nassume that it's been approved cuz\n\n375\n00:22:09.016 --> 00:22:09.699\nwe have to.\n\n376\n00:22:09.699 --> 00:22:15.847\nAnd then in our next episode, we're going\nto start on our implementation road map,\n\n377\n00:22:15.847 --> 00:22:20.410\nin other words,\nhow we implement the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n378\n00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:21.427\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\n\n379\n00:22:21.427 --> 00:22:25.250\nI'm definitely interested to see how\nthat road map comes to fruition.\n\n380\n00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.320\nAnd hopefully, you are as well.\n\n381\n00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.415\nSo definitely join us back.\n\n382\n00:22:27.415 --> 00:22:29.320\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n383\n00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.150\nSo, signing out for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n384\n00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.936\n&gt;&gt;

episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.603 --> 00:00:18.561\nI'm your host Justin Dennison,\nand well you asked for it so\n\n7\n00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:20.467\nwe're bringing in back at you at you.\n\n8\n00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:24.394\nThat's the SIAM foundation, and we're\ngonna be looking at the implementation and\n\n9\n00:00:24.394 --> 00:00:24.901\nroadmap.\n\n10\n00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:28.894\nAnd well, I say we collectively but I'm\nnot actually gonna do much other than ask\n\n11\n00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:31.594\na few questions, but\nthe one is gonna down the road Ms.\n\n12\n00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:34.710\nJo Peacock, how you doing today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great,\n\n13\n00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.580\nthank you Justin how are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic as well.\n\n14\n00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.531\nI'm kind of interested to see, right,\nwe looked at the business use case or\n\n15\n00:00:41.531 --> 00:00:43.750\nthe business case, excuse me.\n\n16\n00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.100\nAnd now we are going to start\nplanning this implementation, right.\n\n17\n00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.050\nWhere do we even begin with it?\n&gt;&gt; Right well, to be honest,\n\n18\n00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.440\nI have been referring,\nin all of our previous episodes,\n\n19\n00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.060\nI have been referring to\nthis as an evolution.\n\n20\n00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.490\nAnd it's still is,\nwe're still in evolution mode.\n\n21\n00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.010\nBut nevertheless,\ngenerally we do start off with a decision,\n\n22\n00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.550\nthat is the approved business case,\nbut that decision\n\n23\n00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.060\nis the decision to move to\na formal SIAM ecosystem.\n\n24\n00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.210\nAnd by the way you never have to start\noff with a blank sheet of paper, never.\n\n25\n00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.220\nAnd we haven't done that\nin IT since way back\n\n26\n00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.470\nin the 1970s potentially\nthe 1980s at the latest.\n\n27\n00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.490\nWe always start off with\nwhere we are right now.\n\n28\n00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.910\nYou never reinvent the wheel.\n\n29\n00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.760\nSo we're gonna start off with\nwherever we are right now,\n\n30\n00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.420\nwhether it be working to an ITIL\nframework or whether it be working,\n\n31\n00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.390\nhaving achieves ISO 20000, nevertheless,\nwe're gonna start off there.\n\n32\n00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.250\nAnd then we are going to,\nafter the decision has been made and\n\n33\n00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.710\nthe business case has been approved.\n\n34\n00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.490\nThen we're going to move\ntowards that SIAM ecosystem.\n\n35\n00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.520\nAnd so we have a formal implementation\nroadmap that we have to follow, really and\n\n36\n00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.510\nthat is really simply splitting down\nthat implementation into four stages.\n\n37\n00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.940\nAnd that we're going to do in this\nparticular episode is we're gonna look at\n\n38\n00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.230\nthe contents of each of these four stages.\n\n39\n00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.235\nSo let's take a look at\nthose stages right now.\n\n40\n00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:21.030\nYou'll see that we have discovery and\nstrategy.\n\n41\n00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.010\nSo that's where we decide exactly\nwhat it is that we want to achieve.\n\n42\n00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.980\nThen we plan and build, then we\nimplement and then, we run and improve.\n\n43\n00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.390\nAnd it makes sense, doesn't it?\n\n44\n00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.150\nWe decide what we're gonna do,\nthen we plan it, then we implement it,\n\n45\n00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.240\nand then we carry on\nwith business as usual,\n\n46\n00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.570\nensuring that it remains aligned\nto the needs of the organization.\n\n47\n00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.540\nSo in our first step, then,\ndiscovery and strategy.\n\n48\n00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.870\nThis is where we establish the project and\ndefine the objectives for the project.\n\n49\n00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.210\nAnd defining the objectives means\nthings like the RACI matrix,\n\n50\n00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.250\na dominance framework, but\nalso the roles and responsibilities.\n\n51\n00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.970\nSo, RACI, is that something that\nyou've heard before, Justin?\n\n52\n00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.460\n&gt;&gt; I have not heard of that.\n\n53\n00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.979\nThat's why I had that weird look\non [LAUGH] my face off camera.\n\n54\n00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:14.910\nI was like, the RACI matrix?\n\n55\n00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.120\nI have no idea what you talking about but,\nI mean there are times were there\n\n56\n00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.230\nare some assumed knowledges here, because\nyou've been within a managerial context,\n\n57\n00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.728\nwhich I maybe lacking, so I understand.\n&gt;&gt; A RACI matrix, or\n\n58\n00:03:29.728 --> 00:03:34.662\na RACI model is something that is quite\ncommon within like you said management.\n\n59\n00:03:34.662 --> 00:03:36.772\nIt's quite common within\nproject management,\n\n60\n00:03:36.772 --> 00:03:39.760\nit's certainly common within\nservice management as well.\n\n61\n00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.190\nAnd it simply allows us to define\nroles and responsibilities.\n\n62\n00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.180\nAnd so what we'll do is we'll map\nout the implementation process.\n\n63\n00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.260\nWe'll map out the roles and the response,\nso we'll map out the roles, and\n\n64\n00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.920\nthen we'll map out the names that\nwe have for each particular role.\n\n65\n00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.510\nAnd then we'll decide who is going to\nbe responsible for a certain activity,\n\n66\n00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.880\nwho is going to be accountable for\nthat activity, who we're going to consult,\n\n67\n00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.130\nthat's who's opinion are we going to\nask and who are we going to tell?\n\n68\n00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.950\nWho needs to be informed\nof any given activity?\n\n69\n00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.800\nSo that's RACI, responsible,\naccountable, consulted and informed.\n\n70\n00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.350\nAnd we'll use that to define roles and\nresponsibilities and we also use that\n\n71\n00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.980\nto define the relationships and the\ndependencies between those roles as well.\n\n72\n00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.250\nAnd then of course, we want to define the\nstrategy and what the services are that\n\n73\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.400\nwe are going to manage, and who the\nservice providers are that are in scope.\n\n74\n00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.890\nSo the ones that we're going to manage,\n\n75\n00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.470\nthere maybe some that we\nwant to leave out of scope.\n\n76\n00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.370\nIt really depends on how\nwe're going to implement, and\n\n77\n00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.880\nthat's part of the next\nstage which is the plan.\n\n78\n00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.960\nIt depends on how we're going to implement\nbecause there are various ways that we\n\n79\n00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.150\ncan actually implement\nthe ecosystem itself.\n\n80\n00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.390\nAnd then as part of these discovery and\nstrategy, well,\n\n81\n00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.030\nthe discovery is where we are right now,\nthat's our baseline.\n\n82\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.720\nSo that's number 6 there,\nanalyzing the current state.\n\n83\n00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.352\nAnd that baseline includes the skills,\n\n84\n00:05:09.352 --> 00:05:13.280\nthe people, the services,\nthe service providers,\n\n85\n00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.150\nwhat tools they use and all of\nthe processes that we've got in place.\n\n86\n00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.310\nAnd all of these have to be analyzed,\nso we have to have a starting point.\n\n87\n00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.770\nAnd then we may want to\nanalyze the marketplace for\n\n88\n00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.610\npotential service providers.\n\n89\n00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.475\nIn other words,\nwho could be our service integrator?\n\n90\n00:05:30.475 --> 00:05:35.350\nNow, that could be somebody internal or\ncould be somebody external.\n\n91\n00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.390\nBut never the less we still want\nto analyze the marketplace.\n\n92\n00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.040\nWe want to see what's available out there.\n\n93\n00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.780\nThere are organizations now\nthat are specifically that.\n\n94\n00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.400\nTheir sole purposes is to act as SIAM\nservice integrators, to act as that\n\n95\n00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.520\ncoordination point, to do the management\nof all of our service providers for us.\n\n96\n00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.400\nAnd then of course we've got this business\ncase that these then part of that\n\n97\n00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.560\ndiscovery in that strategy\nwhere we will actually\n\n98\n00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.520\ncome up with the justifications for why we\nwant to implement the SIAM ecostructure.\n\n99\n00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.700\nOnce we have all of that in place,\n\n100\n00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.430\nonce we've understood our roles and\nresponsibilities,\n\n101\n00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.650\nonce we have understood exactly\nwhat it is that we want to achieve.\n\n102\n00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.200\nBear it in mind that for the business\ncase we just need to be at a very,\n\n103\n00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.280\nvery high level.\n\n104\n00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.650\nIt doesn't need to be involved.\n\n105\n00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.600\nWe looked at that when we\nlooked at the business case.\n\n106\n00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.160\nIt doesn't need to be technical.\n\n107\n00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.100\nOnce we have decided exactly\nwhat it is we want to achieve,\n\n108\n00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.340\nwe've highlighted their vision,\nthen we plan and build.\n\n109\n00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.550\nAnd the plan and\nbuild stage is simply exactly as it stays.\n\n110\n00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.250\nWe plan and we build, simple.\n\n111\n00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.650\nSo all of our plans,\nthey're put into place.\n\n112\n00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.520\nAll of the roles and\nresponsibilities are assigned, and\n\n113\n00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.110\nthis is where we complete the design.\n\n114\n00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.980\nAnd we ensure that the design meets\n\n115\n00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.480\nall of the requirements of\nthe actual project itself.\n\n116\n00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.320\nAnd then we look at organizational\nchange management which is,\n\n117\n00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.450\nof course, the people side of this.\n\n118\n00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.770\nRemember we discovered this, or\nwe discussed this, in a previous episode?\n\n119\n00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.900\nThe people side of things,\ncreating a need and going out there and\n\n120\n00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.260\npublicizing that need.\n\n121\n00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.250\nAnswering the question,\nwhat's in it for me?\n\n122\n00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.330\nAnd Justin,\nI see you in the corner of my eye there.\n\n123\n00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.930\nYou're looking a little bit sort\nof I wouldn't say confused but\n\n124\n00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.890\ncertainly I reckon you got a question?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if I have a question yet.\n\n125\n00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.755\nI don't wanna steal your\nthunder Jo because-\n\n126\n00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:37.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n127\n00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.420\n&gt;&gt; I think I may be\n\n128\n00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.150\nmisconstruing stage 2 and stage 3.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n129\n00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.420\n&gt;&gt; Because this is plan and\n\n130\n00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.325\nbuild\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n131\n00:07:47.325 --> 00:07:51.496\nthen there's some implementation\nin stage 3 if I'm not mistaken.\n\n132\n00:07:51.496 --> 00:07:56.140\nAnd I'm not gonna ask my question yet,\nI'm gonna reserve it.\n\n133\n00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.753\nTo see if it's answered actually, as we\ngo through like moving from stage 2 to\n\n134\n00:07:59.753 --> 00:08:01.450\nstage 3.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n135\n00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.690\nPlanning and Building is just the design.\n\n136\n00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.140\nIt's the design and\nit's the building of that design.\n\n137\n00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.600\nImplementation is deployment.\n\n138\n00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.760\nSo implementation is, it's where we do it.\n\n139\n00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.240\nAt the moment what we're\nin is planning mode.\n\n140\n00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.380\nSo we're in the architect frame, so let's\nsay that we were building a house, for\n\n141\n00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.220\ninstance.\n\n142\n00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.570\nSo in the strategy aspect,\nin that discovery and strategy,\n\n143\n00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.740\nwe've already decided how much\nmoney we've got to spend.\n\n144\n00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.090\nAnd we've gone to our steering group,\nwe've gone to the bank and we've asked for\n\n145\n00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.690\nthe approval and\nwe've got the approval for the money.\n\n146\n00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.630\nBased on a high level strategy.\n\n147\n00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:43.700\nSo now here we are we are at\nthe architect's office.\n\n148\n00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.080\nAnd we've given the money to\nthe architect and said hey go away.\n\n149\n00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:52.140\nDesign me something, and\nappoint all of the contractors.\n\n150\n00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.560\nAnd let's start to build my new house.\n\n151\n00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.380\nThat's what we're doing right now.\n\n152\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.460\nSo we're at the architect stage and\n\n153\n00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:07.480\nwe're starting to build a model for\nwhat SIAM will look like.\n\n154\n00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.160\nSo here we are,\n\n155\n00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.020\nwe're appointing the service integrator,\nwe're appointing the service providers.\n\n156\n00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.920\nIn other words, we're appointing\na builder, we're appointing a contractor.\n\n157\n00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.490\nAnd then we review with the customer\nto make sure that we have got\n\n158\n00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.350\nall of their requirements.\n\n159\n00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:29.610\nAnd then it's at this point in\ntime now where we implement.\n\n160\n00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.430\nAn implementation is\nactually the deployment.\n\n161\n00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.250\nAnd the deployment is, well,\nit's where we roll it out,\n\n162\n00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.270\nit's where we roll out the new model.\n\n163\n00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:45.050\nSo in our previous stage,\nwe have planned all of our processes,\n\n164\n00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.080\nwe've documented all of our processes,\n\n165\n00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.000\nwe've documented the relationships\nbetween all of our processes.\n\n166\n00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.920\nAnd this is where want to implement.\n\n167\n00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.120\nNow, there are two ways of implementing.\n\n168\n00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.700\nWe can implement in a big bang way.\n\n169\n00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.280\nWhich is to everybody all at the same\ntime, all of our service providers.\n\n170\n00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.760\nThat obviously is a higher risk\n\n171\n00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.250\nbecause we're making a huge sweeping\nchange all at the same time.\n\n172\n00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:13.515\nOr we can implement in a Phased approach.\n\n173\n00:10:13.515 --> 00:10:17.855\nAnd a phased approach may mean one\nbusiness unit at a time is moving to\n\n174\n00:10:17.855 --> 00:10:18.785\nthe new model, or\n\n175\n00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:24.515\nit may be one service provider at\na time is moving to the new ecosystem.\n\n176\n00:10:25.575 --> 00:10:27.920\nThat has a lower risk.\n\n177\n00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.320\nBut at the same time,\nit can be more difficult.\n\n178\n00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.150\nBecause let's think about these\nrelationships that exist between all of\n\n179\n00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.590\nthese service providers that\nwe're trying to put in place.\n\n180\n00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.240\nSo we might choose to do\nit process by process.\n\n181\n00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.850\nAgain, another phased approach,\nprocess by process.\n\n182\n00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.430\nThere are various ways\nthat we can implement.\n\n183\n00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:53.470\nAn implementation simply means\nwe deploy the ecosystem.\n\n184\n00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:58.430\nSo in our previous phase,\nwe have designed our processes,\n\n185\n00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.890\nwe've built them,\nwe've got approval for those processes.\n\n186\n00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:07.360\nWe've been to all of our service providers\nand said this is what we want to achieve\n\n187\n00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.480\nwith all of these processes,\nthese are our service level targets.\n\n188\n00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.930\nAnd so we'd like you to adhere to these.\n\n189\n00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.140\nAnd they've all agreed.\n\n190\n00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.090\nAnd that's what's happened\nin our previous stage.\n\n191\n00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:24.710\nAnd now in this particular stage,\nwe're saying mud, okay, you know, do it.\n\n192\n00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.900\nHere's your new SLTs,\nnow let's stick to those.\n\n193\n00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:36.240\nSo this is where the new contracts\ntake effect, in the implementation.\n\n194\n00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.350\nAnd so we also have to have that\norganizational change of management as\n\n195\n00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:44.440\nwell because we've gotta have\nthe business On board with us and\n\n196\n00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.840\nwe've gotta have everybody else.\n\n197\n00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.420\nAll of our stakeholders.\n\n198\n00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:52.110\nStakeholder being any interested party,\nthey've all got to be completely on board.\n\n199\n00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.640\nThis is the point in time where we say\nto our business potentially, okay,\n\n200\n00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.770\ndon't ring this number when you've got\na problem, you need to call this one.\n\n201\n00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:01.610\nThis is the implementation.\n\n202\n00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:05.260\nYou're still looking perplexed, so\ntell me whether I answered your question.\n\n203\n00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.380\n&gt;&gt; You have answered my question, but\n\n204\n00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.736\nit brought up additional questions,\nand some clarfications.\n\n205\n00:12:10.736 --> 00:12:11.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There's a.\n\n206\n00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, who would've thought?\n\n207\n00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:18.300\nSo in the previous stage, I guess\nthe cost of change is lower if you,\n\n208\n00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:23.200\nif you find out that one of your processes\nhad, because at the very last of stage\n\n209\n00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.240\ntwo was review and approval.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n210\n00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:26.910\n&gt;&gt; And I'm guessing that\n\n211\n00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.070\nthrough some kind of a review process.\n\n212\n00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.860\nThe cost of modifying your\nplan at that point is easy.\n\n213\n00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.630\nOnce we get here,\nit's a little more difficult if something\n\n214\n00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:41.650\ncomes to fruition where you are like,\nthat actually may present a problem.\n\n215\n00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.690\nIt's going to be a little more\nwork at this point, right?\n\n216\n00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.510\n&gt;&gt; Ya, so, in that previous stage,\n\n217\n00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:52.500\nwe have already gone out to all of our\nservice providers, and we have, probably,\n\n218\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.920\nand I would expect this to happen,\nwe've gone out to these providers and\n\n219\n00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:02.180\nwe have said to them, okay these are the\nlevel targets we would like you to follow.\n\n220\n00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.420\nThese are the targets that we'd\nlike you to adhere to, and\n\n221\n00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.680\nthis is what we want to put\nin place in our contract.\n\n222\n00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.680\nAnd in the previous stage,\nthey've all agreed.\n\n223\n00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.430\nAnd now is where we implement all of that.\n\n224\n00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:17.330\nIf at this point in time one service\nprovider just simply puts their hand out\n\n225\n00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:22.440\nand says, well, I can't do that,\nFor whatever reason.\n\n226\n00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.320\nI can't do that,\nthen that affects absolutely everything.\n\n227\n00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.340\nAnd we're kind of back\nto the drawing board.\n\n228\n00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.980\nSo we're reworking everything\nthat we've already done.\n\n229\n00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.510\nSo yeah, it's more costly,\nit's inefficient and\n\n230\n00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.260\ntherefore it's going to\nmore costly to do that.\n\n231\n00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:41.740\nWhich is why it's important that\nwe get the design Complete and\n\n232\n00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.010\nagreed before we move\ninto this implementation.\n\n233\n00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.760\nBecause once we've already told everybody,\nand\n\n234\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.860\nthis is just an example, but\nonce we've already told everybody,\n\n235\n00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.880\nhey I need you to use this\nnew phone number from now on.\n\n236\n00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.850\nWe can't just suddenly turn around and\nsay, no, sorry, my mistake.\n\n237\n00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.400\nLet's go back to the old\nway of doing things and\n\n238\n00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.810\nwe'll let you know when that\nphone number is active again.\n\n239\n00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.620\nDamages our credibility for a start.\n\n240\n00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.830\nIt's very, very inefficient.\n\n241\n00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.970\nNobody knows whether they're coming and\ngoing.\n\n242\n00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:18.800\nWell, I've already mentioned about\ncredibility, but our business,\n\n243\n00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.380\nour customer loses faith in us.\n\n244\n00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.870\nSo it's not something that we really want\nto do because this is where it's visible.\n\n245\n00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.420\nThe implementation Is visible.\n\n246\n00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.210\nIt's visible to the customer.\n\n247\n00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.220\nThis is where the customer\ngets what they're paying for.\n\n248\n00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.760\nWe've already gone to them and asked\nthem for some money to implement this.\n\n249\n00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.190\nAnd this is where they\nstart to see the benefits.\n\n250\n00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.810\nIf we start to give them a benefit and\nthen we take it away and go no, sorry,\n\n251\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.140\nmy mistake.\n\n252\n00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.350\nNot today, but\nmaybe in a couple of months' time.\n\n253\n00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.700\nThey gonna be wonder why\nthey gave you the money,\n\n254\n00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.570\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Well I would definitely be\n\n255\n00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.050\nwondering why they your money.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n256\n00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.620\n&gt;&gt; If you're like, here you go.\n\n257\n00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.260\nNah, I'm just kidding but that brings up\n\n258\n00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:05.060\na following point during the, correct me\nif I'm wrong, during the planning phase,\n\n259\n00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.310\nwe're planning on whether this is\ngonna be a phase implementation or\n\n260\n00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.490\na sweeping change Which is\ngoing to be agreed upon.\n\n261\n00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.990\nBut if we do a phased implementation\n\n262\n00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.150\neven though that kind of\neases everybody into it.\n\n263\n00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:22.445\nWhoever is implementing or deploying\nnow has a little bit more to juggle.\n\n264\n00:15:22.445 --> 00:15:25.750\n[INAUDIBLE] Or am I misunderstanding that?\n\n265\n00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.480\nLike this department or this process or\n\n266\n00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.800\nthis service is the old way.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n267\n00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.560\n&gt;&gt; And then this is the new way and\n\n268\n00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.690\nsomebody is got to keep that straight,\n\n269\n00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:38.030\nright?\n&gt;&gt; This is going to be a difficult\n\n270\n00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:39.490\ndecision to make.\n\n271\n00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.360\nBecause it's a major decision.\n\n272\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:47.191\nYou've got so many service providers, and\nthey're all working different ways anyway.\n\n273\n00:15:47.191 --> 00:15:52.131\nAnd so, what we want to do is we wanna get\neverybody working in exactly the same way,\n\n274\n00:15:52.131 --> 00:15:54.540\nor at least we want to get them more.\n\n275\n00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.241\nWorking towards the same\nservice level targets.\n\n276\n00:15:58.241 --> 00:16:02.833\nWhich means that if we implement\nsome service providers at a time,\n\n277\n00:16:02.833 --> 00:16:06.940\nthen we're not gonna be building\non those relationships.\n\n278\n00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.175\nAnd what do we say to our customers?\n\n279\n00:16:09.175 --> 00:16:12.265\nWell, okay, so for\nthe moment, call this number.\n\n280\n00:16:12.265 --> 00:16:14.415\nAnd then in two weeks\ntime call this number.\n\n281\n00:16:14.415 --> 00:16:17.525\nAnd then two weeks later you're\ngonna call this number for this.\n\n282\n00:16:17.525 --> 00:16:20.452\nAnd then for this you call this number.\n\n283\n00:16:20.452 --> 00:16:25.152\nThey're probably already in that frame\nof mind where they're calling 15\n\n284\n00:16:25.152 --> 00:16:29.382\ndifferent numbers for 15 different things\nand specially if we have a shadow IT,\n\n285\n00:16:29.382 --> 00:16:33.442\nwhere the business units have gone\ndown directly to the suppliers anyway.\n\n286\n00:16:33.442 --> 00:16:36.342\nWe're trying to make life simpler.\n\n287\n00:16:36.342 --> 00:16:40.072\nWe are not trying to make\nlife more difficult for them.\n\n288\n00:16:40.072 --> 00:16:43.930\nSo implementing a phased\napproach can be more confusing.\n\n289\n00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:50.070\nYou've also got to bear in mind that\nour role is to deliver value to\n\n290\n00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:51.140\nthe organization.\n\n291\n00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:56.190\nThat's the entire aim of the SIAM\necosystem, is to make life easier for\n\n292\n00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.580\nthe customer organization.\n\n293\n00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.260\nIt's to deliver value.\n\n294\n00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.930\nWhat we don't wanna do\nis deliver confusion.\n\n295\n00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:07.160\nSo a phased approach is easier\nto manage in one respect,\n\n296\n00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.100\nbecause if something goes wrong we've\nonly got to potentially roll back or\n\n297\n00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:15.670\nmake adjustments, make changes, to one\nparticular portion of the implementation.\n\n298\n00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:20.460\nAnd there's less of a risk involved in\nthat, because there's only maybe one\n\n299\n00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.300\nservice provider at a time\nthat is going to be affected.\n\n300\n00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:30.910\nThe big bang approach is,\nin some ways it's easier to manage because\n\n301\n00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:36.280\nit's simpler, however, the scale is\nlarger and there's more people affected.\n\n302\n00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.400\nSo potentially,\n\n303\n00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:42.070\nthe number of phone calls that you could\nget about it could be greatly increased.\n\n304\n00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:44.710\nSo it's higher risk,\nbecause there's more to go wrong.\n\n305\n00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:50.370\nThere is no right or\nwrong as to which approach you will take.\n\n306\n00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:54.720\nIt's entirely up to the organization\nas to which approach they will take.\n\n307\n00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.600\nWho makes the decision?\n&gt;&gt; Steering group?\n\n308\n00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.530\nExecutives?\n&gt;&gt; It'll be\n\n309\n00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:04.760\nthe executives.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n310\n00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it'll be the customer.\n\n311\n00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:12.970\nThis is, you see what we're doing is\nwe're moving to a service integrator.\n\n312\n00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:17.810\nWe are moving to a SIAM ecosystem.\n\n313\n00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:21.210\nSo this is affecting the customer, so\n\n314\n00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:25.320\nthe customer has to make the decision\nas to whether they want to\n\n315\n00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.740\ndo this in a phased manner,\nwhich may be more confusing for them or\n\n316\n00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:33.480\nwhether to do this in a big bang manner,\nwhich may have more of an impact to them.\n\n317\n00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.150\nAnd that impact could be positive,\nbut it could be negative as well.\n\n318\n00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.920\nSo the customer is gonna\nmake that decision.\n\n319\n00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.520\nOnce we get to a place where\nit's been implemented,\n\n320\n00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:49.750\nthen we simply maintaining the status quo,\nthis is business as usual.\n\n321\n00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:55.040\nBusiness as usual also means\nthat we have to ensure\n\n322\n00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.830\nthat we're aligned to the needs of the\norganization in the SIAM eco structure.\n\n323\n00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:05.240\nSo the ecosystem itself well,\nit has to be main aligned,\n\n324\n00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.235\nit has to be subject to\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n325\n00:19:09.235 --> 00:19:13.310\nAnd I know that we've had discussions in\nprevious episodes about continual versus\n\n326\n00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.500\ncontinuous.\n\n327\n00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.910\nIterative improvements,\niterative evaluation where we\n\n328\n00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:23.970\nare checking to ensure that we are still\nmeeting the needs of the organization.\n\n329\n00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:28.270\nSo here, the business as usual\nis where we have that day-to-day\n\n330\n00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:31.490\nmanagement of the processes and\nof the people etc.\n\n331\n00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:37.040\nBut it's where we also seek to remain\naligned to the needs of the organization.\n\n332\n00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.670\nThis is not something that you can,\nwith any implementation,\n\n333\n00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:45.320\nyou can't just wave a magic wand and\nit suddenly happens.\n\n334\n00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.720\nEverything works and everybody is happy.\n\n335\n00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:53.010\nThere is always going to be somebody\nthat is going to affected negatively\n\n336\n00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.230\npossibly more than everyone else.\n\n337\n00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.790\nIt's a part of any implementation,\nincluding the implementation or\n\n338\n00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:03.460\nthe evolution to the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n339\n00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:09.340\nIt's got to involve customer surveys,\nit's got to involve customer satisfaction.\n\n340\n00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:14.330\nAnd it's got to involve the customer\nat the forefront of the project.\n\n341\n00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.270\nCuz ultimately what we're trying\nto do is make life easier and\n\n342\n00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.270\ndeliver more value to the customer.\n\n343\n00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.870\nWe're also trying to make it easier in\nthe background as well cuz we're trying to\n\n344\n00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.150\nmake IT easier to manage.\n\n345\n00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:29.600\nBut ultimately what we've got to do is\ndeliver value to the organization and\n\n346\n00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.510\ntherefore we've got to make\nsure that we don't just\n\n347\n00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.840\ndeliver value after we've implement it.\n\n348\n00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.418\nBut the actual process of the\nimplementation itself also delivers value\n\n349\n00:20:38.418 --> 00:20:40.595\nand doesn't deliver too much disruption.\n\n350\n00:20:42.842 --> 00:20:48.217\nSo this point in time what we're going\nto do is we're going to be moving\n\n351\n00:20:48.217 --> 00:20:53.330\ninto the different structures with\nSIAM within our next episode.\n\n352\n00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:56.220\nAnd I see Justin looking confused again.\n\n353\n00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.130\nI know that this is a permanent\nkinda state of affairs,\n\n354\n00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.690\nbut.\n&gt;&gt; It's not so much a confusion,\n\n355\n00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.380\nit just my mind is racing.\n\n356\n00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.900\nI'm like, all right, so you gotta plan and\nbuild, and then you got implementations.\n\n357\n00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.110\nBut there's a lot going on here.\n\n358\n00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.260\nAnd even though these are four steps,\n\n359\n00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:19.180\neach step has an embedded set of steps\nthat because of my background Jo,\n\n360\n00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:25.810\nI I'm getting a little hot blooded or\nsomething, I don't know what's going on.\n\n361\n00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:29.380\nI'm trying to make sense, make sure I have\nall the pieces sticking in the puzzle,\n\n362\n00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.270\nbut maybe I'm not supposed to\nunderstand everything at this moment,\n\n363\n00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:35.480\nbecause we have a lot more coming right?\n&gt;&gt; We've got more to comment, but\n\n364\n00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.730\nI want you to bare in mind that what\nwe summed up in kinda 25 minutes\n\n365\n00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:41.290\n&gt;&gt; With each of these steps,\n\n366\n00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:46.550\nI can tell you now that\nthere are very lengthy\n\n367\n00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:51.360\ncourses that will cover each of\nthese steps in a lot more detail.\n\n368\n00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.630\nThey go into a lot more detail\nabout each particular step.\n\n369\n00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.770\nSo whilst here we've\njust given an overview.\n\n370\n00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:02.370\nThis is what we need for\nour SIAM foundation material and\n\n371\n00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:06.810\nto ensure that you can get\nthrough the SIAM foundation exam.\n\n372\n00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.650\nBut we go into this in a lot more\ndepth in other series, don't worry.\n\n373\n00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:15.160\nYou're not gonna be left out.\n&gt;&gt; That\n\n374\n00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.250\nactually soothes my heart a little\nbit because I was getting scared,\n\n375\n00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:19.840\nbecause I knew you were gonna test me-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n376\n00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.000\n&gt;&gt; At the end of this.\n\n377\n00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.010\nWhich reminds me,\n\n378\n00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.990\nwhere are we going from here again?\n&gt;&gt; We're going to be looking at\n\n379\n00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.600\nthe different structures with SIAM.\n\n380\n00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.870\nSo we're going to be looking at,\n\n381\n00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:30.800\nas service integrators\n&gt;&gt; In our next episode we're gonna\n\n382\n00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.750\nbe looking at internal service integrators\nversus external service integrators and\n\n383\n00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:40.510\nhybrid service integrators as well.\n&gt;&gt; That's still a lot coming at you, so\n\n384\n00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:42.135\nyou should definitely come back.\n\n385\n00:22:42.135 --> 00:22:44.730\nI'm getting kind of exited,\nI didn't think I would be, but\n\n386\n00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.560\nI am getting kind of exited to know\nmore and hopefully you are as well.\n\n387\n00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.830\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n388\n00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.910\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n389\n00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:53.790\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n390\n00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:54.370\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n391\n00:22:54.370 --> 00:23:01.678\n[MUSIC]\n\n392\n00:23:01.678 -->

00:00:11.940\nYou're watching ITPROTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.984\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITPROTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.984 --> 00:00:17.085\nI'm your host Justin Dennison.\n\n6\n00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:19.697\nAnd we're continuing on with\nour SIAM Foundation and\n\n7\n00:00:19.697 --> 00:00:22.607\nwe're gonna be looking at\nexternal service integrators.\n\n8\n00:00:22.607 --> 00:00:25.935\nI think I said all of those words\ncorrectly, but I'm sure I'll know very\n\n9\n00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:29.475\nquickly, because we have a very\nspecial guest in house with us today.\n\n10\n00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:30.940\nMs. Jo Peacock, how do you do today Jo?\n\n11\n00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.670\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you Justin.\n\n12\n00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.420\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.020\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, and you know,\nwe've been working along in this series,\n\n14\n00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.584\nand now, we're actually gonna be talking\nabout these service integrators.\n\n15\n00:00:40.584 --> 00:00:44.960\nThere's been several questions in my mind\nabout what do these actually look like?\n\n16\n00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.130\nHow did they manage all their jobs also,\nI'm scared, because I thought it would be\n\n17\n00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.190\na cool job, and\nthen it seems like a very complicated job.\n\n18\n00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.419\nBut external service integrators,\nthese are people that\n\n19\n00:00:57.419 --> 00:01:02.434\nare helping a company with employing\nthe SIAM methodology, Right?\n\n20\n00:01:02.434 --> 00:01:06.302\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily employing it,\nbut certainly managing it.\n\n21\n00:01:06.302 --> 00:01:09.399\nSo if you remember we've\ngot three layers to SIAM.\n\n22\n00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.454\nAnd those three layers that\nwe had were customer layer,\n\n23\n00:01:12.454 --> 00:01:17.370\nthen we have a service integrator layer,\nand then we have our service providers.\n\n24\n00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.260\nAnd in fact we've actually got a slide,\njust to simplify that three layers.\n\n25\n00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.010\nAnd, there we go,\n[LAUGH] right in front of us now.\n\n26\n00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.160\nSo our customer organization with\ntheir retained capabilities and\n\n27\n00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.420\nwe'll look at that in a moment.\n\n28\n00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.811\nAnd then we've got our\nservice integrator there.\n\n29\n00:01:31.811 --> 00:01:35.920\nAnd, as I said, we've got these\nservice providers underneath.\n\n30\n00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.490\nNow, what we'll do is, we could,\n\n31\n00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.140\nwe've got various options in\nterms of our service integrator.\n\n32\n00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.280\nWe could keep our service\nintegrator internal, we could go\n\n33\n00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.170\noutside, and we could have\nan external service integrator.\n\n34\n00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.576\nWe could have a hybrid,\nwhich is a mixture of both internal and\n\n35\n00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:04.110\nexternal service integrator, or we could\nhave what we call a lead supplier.\n\n36\n00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.547\nAnd over the next few episodes, so\n\n37\n00:02:06.547 --> 00:02:11.265\nwe're gonna have another mini\nseries in this particular series.\n\n38\n00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:15.315\nAnd over the next few episodes,\nwe're going to look at those four options.\n\n39\n00:02:15.315 --> 00:02:20.334\nAnd we're gonna look at the pros and cons\nof each particular option, so here we've\n\n40\n00:02:20.334 --> 00:02:25.083\ngot our external service integrator and\nthat is an outsourced organization.\n\n41\n00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:30.086\nIt's external to\nthe customer organization.\n\n42\n00:02:30.086 --> 00:02:34.166\nThere's a few things that really I wanna\nmention, a few points that we've got to\n\n43\n00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:38.030\nbring out here when we look at\nexternal service integrators.\n\n44\n00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.396\nAn External Service Integrator,\nis an integrator that is just simply well,\n\n45\n00:02:42.396 --> 00:02:45.320\nas I said,\nare external to the organization.\n\n46\n00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.380\nAnd so, what that means is,\nthat we are handing over the management\n\n47\n00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.450\nof all of those other service\nproviders to somebody external to us.\n\n48\n00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.348\nThis can happen in a number of,\nwell, for a number of reasons.\n\n49\n00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:06.223\nOne of those reasons being that maybe\nwe're a very small organization, but\n\n50\n00:03:06.223 --> 00:03:11.171\nwe've got a lot of suppliers, because\nwe've got a lot of bespoke software,\n\n51\n00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:15.060\nbespoke applications,\ntailor-made applications.\n\n52\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.510\nWe've got a lot of\nspecialist applications.\n\n53\n00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.943\nAnd therefore, we're going to\nemploy somebody within an IT shop,\n\n54\n00:03:21.943 --> 00:03:25.227\nas you might call it,\nto manage all of that for us.\n\n55\n00:03:25.227 --> 00:03:30.195\nOr another reason is that we might be\na huge organization, global organization,\n\n56\n00:03:30.195 --> 00:03:35.235\nand we've got so many external providers\nthat it might be more cost-effective for\n\n57\n00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:36.710\nus to outsource.\n\n58\n00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.860\nAnd to go externally, and allow somebody\nelse to manage all of that complexity,\n\n59\n00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.970\nall of the complex relationships\nbetween our service providers.\n\n60\n00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.780\nSo an external service provider is brought\nin or an external service integrators,\n\n61\n00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.280\nsorry, is brought in by\na number of organizations.\n\n62\n00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.356\nAnd scale doesn't necessarily\nplay a part in this at all.\n\n63\n00:03:59.356 --> 00:04:03.232\nIt really is down to what you want\nthat service integrator to do, and\n\n64\n00:04:03.232 --> 00:04:05.680\nwhether you have those skills in-house,\n\n65\n00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.190\nand whether you're planning on retaining\nthose skills in-house, as well.\n\n66\n00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.965\nSo when we consider there has to be\na choice between whether you are going to\n\n67\n00:04:14.965 --> 00:04:20.155\nstay in-house or whether you're going\nto go outside and we've got a number\n\n68\n00:04:20.155 --> 00:04:25.175\nof factors that we might want to to\nconsider when we're making that choice.\n\n69\n00:04:25.175 --> 00:04:30.089\nBut scale,\ninvariably is not necessarily one of them.\n\n70\n00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:33.137\nNow, the scale of the external\norganization though,\n\n71\n00:04:33.137 --> 00:04:34.467\nmay well be one of them.\n\n72\n00:04:34.467 --> 00:04:39.072\nAnd the ability of that organization to\nadapt to certain situations may well be\n\n73\n00:04:39.072 --> 00:04:40.040\none of them.\n\n74\n00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.001\nLet's look at some pros and\n\n75\n00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:46.878\ncons here on the internal versus\nthe external service integrator.\n\n76\n00:04:46.878 --> 00:04:52.206\nSo an internal service integrator,\nJustin, let's bring you in on this one.\n\n77\n00:04:52.206 --> 00:04:56.944\nAll right, an internal service integrator,\ntheir internal to our organization.\n\n78\n00:04:56.944 --> 00:05:00.140\nWhat do you think the pros and\ncons are on this?\n\n79\n00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.644\n&gt;&gt; So the pros, I would think that they\nwould know more about your business.\n\n80\n00:05:03.644 --> 00:05:09.487\nThey would have more kind of insights\nto respective business used cases and\n\n81\n00:05:09.487 --> 00:05:13.302\nyou would be able to work\nmore closely with them.\n\n82\n00:05:13.302 --> 00:05:18.338\nThe cons is now you're retaining,\nyou're also having to\n\n83\n00:05:18.338 --> 00:05:23.592\ncultivate the actual skills\nnecessary to become that role.\n\n84\n00:05:23.592 --> 00:05:28.321\nAs well as there's some cost associated\nwith that by retaining those internally.\n\n85\n00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:32.910\nSo it's kind of a give and\ntake there I would think for internals.\n\n86\n00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.824\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so, we just flip that on its\nhead for our external service integrators.\n\n87\n00:05:37.824 --> 00:05:40.440\nSo internal service integrators,\nyou're right,\n\n88\n00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.540\nthey are completely knowledgeable\nabout our organization.\n\n89\n00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.450\nAnd there's something else that you might\nhave missed there, is the fact that they\n\n90\n00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:55.130\nare also more likely to be privy to\nthe strategy of the organization as well.\n\n91\n00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:01.000\nSo they're more likely to be\naligned to the organization and\n\n92\n00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.750\nto the strategy of the organization.\n\n93\n00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.060\nAnd I say more likely, they're not waiting\nto be told there in the organization.\n\n94\n00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.105\nAnd depending on the actual culture, and\n\n95\n00:06:10.105 --> 00:06:12.793\nI not necessarily mean just\nthe business culture, but\n\n96\n00:06:12.793 --> 00:06:16.373\ndepending on the actual culture itself\nin the country that they're in.\n\n97\n00:06:16.373 --> 00:06:21.308\nThen, they will be treated as though\nthey are part of the organization and\n\n98\n00:06:21.308 --> 00:06:25.208\ntherefore, they will be privy\nto information within that\n\n99\n00:06:25.208 --> 00:06:29.448\norganization that an external\nservice integrator might not.\n\n100\n00:06:29.448 --> 00:06:33.175\nAnd I say depending on the culture,\nbecause in some cultures will\n\n101\n00:06:33.175 --> 00:06:37.242\ntreat external organizations as sort\nof just an extension of ours, but\n\n102\n00:06:37.242 --> 00:06:41.290\nin other cultures they're\ntreated completely differently.\n\n103\n00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.815\nAnd so, that again is something that you\nhave to consider when you're making that\n\n104\n00:06:45.815 --> 00:06:48.713\ndecision, to use an external\nservice integrator.\n\n105\n00:06:48.713 --> 00:06:52.831\nIn terms of with the pros and\ncons you mentioned,\n\n106\n00:06:52.831 --> 00:06:58.658\nthe fact that an internal service\nintegrator may not be as flexible,\n\n107\n00:06:58.658 --> 00:07:01.580\nmay not be as adaptable to change.\n\n108\n00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.363\nThey may not necessarily\nhave these skills.\n\n109\n00:07:05.363 --> 00:07:10.284\nAnd you also use word,\nwhich I really like, which was cultivate.\n\n110\n00:07:10.284 --> 00:07:14.517\nAnd external service integrator is gonna\nbe able to cultivate those skills.\n\n111\n00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:17.903\nAn external service integrator is actually\n\n112\n00:07:17.903 --> 00:07:22.301\ngoing to be able to maintain\na skill level that is needed.\n\n113\n00:07:22.301 --> 00:07:27.530\nIt's going to be cheaper for them to do\nthat, because you would hope that that\n\n114\n00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.760\nexternal service integrator has got\nenough stuff, enough specialist stuff\n\n115\n00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.930\nto be able to maintain that skill level\nthat's needed by the organization.\n\n116\n00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.800\nBut let's think about the external\nservice integrator and\n\n117\n00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.279\nlet's think about the pros and\ncons of the external service integrator.\n\n118\n00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:49.274\nBecause you see with\nthe external service integrator,\n\n119\n00:07:49.274 --> 00:07:53.860\nwe've looked to all of the benefits as it\nwere with the external service integrator,\n\n120\n00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.700\nbut let's look at the disadvantages.\n\n121\n00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.957\nThe disadvantages\nare perhaps that culture.\n\n122\n00:07:59.957 --> 00:08:04.389\nPerhaps they are not as aware of\nthe strategy of the organization,\n\n123\n00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:06.377\nthe customer organization.\n\n124\n00:08:06.377 --> 00:08:09.800\nWe know that they gonna have skills,\nthat's great.\n\n125\n00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.770\nBut those skills gonna be very generic,\nthey're gonna be generic skills.\n\n126\n00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:22.470\nWell, the internal service integrator,\ntheir skills are gonna be very specific.\n\n127\n00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:27.120\nBut, the external service integrator,\nthey're gonna have generic skills.\n\n128\n00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.100\nIt's easy to keep those up to date.\n\n129\n00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.950\nIt's not so easy to keep\nthe specific skills up to date,\n\n130\n00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.380\ncertainly not at a reasonable cost.\n\n131\n00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:43.550\nThe external service integrator though,\nis also going to have multiple clients.\n\n132\n00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:46.270\nI would expect them to\nhave multiple clients.\n\n133\n00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:51.730\nIf they're just a service integrator fee,\nyour organization, then why would\n\n134\n00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:56.460\nyou select a service integrator that's\njust going to be for your organization?\n\n135\n00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.230\nBecause surely,\n\n136\n00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:01.050\nthen they don't have the experience and\nthey don't have the credibility built up,\n\n137\n00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.710\nto be able to demonstrate that\nthey could perform the role.\n\n138\n00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:09.210\nWhen you're going out to look for\na service integrator, and\n\n139\n00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.130\nyou're going out into the world,\nand you're going\n\n140\n00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.920\nto perform maybe an invitation to\ntender or request for proposals.\n\n141\n00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.230\nThen you're going to look for\npeople that have got experience.\n\n142\n00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:24.170\nAnd you're going to look for organizations\nthat have got credibility and that have\n\n143\n00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:28.620\ngot a very good reputation performing\nthe role that you want them to perform.\n\n144\n00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.620\nAnd you'll certainly not going to look for\n\n145\n00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.550\nsomebody that doesn't have\nany experience at all.\n\n146\n00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.600\nSo that means that my external\nservice integrator then,\n\n147\n00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.450\nI expected them to probably\nhave all the clients.\n\n148\n00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.110\nAnd if they've got all the clients,\n\n149\n00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:47.970\nhow can you be assured that you\nare going to be their number one client.\n\n150\n00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:50.620\nThat's always a challenge.\n\n151\n00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:57.040\nSo, if we just take a look at that\ndiagram there, you'll see that we expect\n\n152\n00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:03.050\nthat external service integrator to\nmanage the external service providers and\n\n153\n00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:07.410\nalso to manage the internal\nservice providers as well.\n\n154\n00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.230\nSo any internal roles that we may have,\n\n155\n00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.440\nI'm expecting somebody\nexternal to manage that.\n\n156\n00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:21.190\nSo we've got a customer organization and\nthen we've got an external integrator,\n\n157\n00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.400\nand then we've got internal\nservice providers.\n\n158\n00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.130\nThat presents us with another challenge.\n\n159\n00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:34.060\nInland is very, very easy for the customer\norganization to buy past the integrated\n\n160\n00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:39.560\ncompletely and go straight to\nthe internal service providers.\n\n161\n00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.482\nThat adds in a layer of complexity for\n\n162\n00:10:41.482 --> 00:10:44.710\nthe customer because the customer\ngot to know who to contact.\n\n163\n00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:49.960\nBut it is not unusual for my customer\nto get to know individual people and\n\n164\n00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:55.138\nfor my customers to just pick up\nthe phone and call individual people.\n\n165\n00:10:55.138 --> 00:11:01.024\nAnd in fact, that's what happens in\nan organization, on a day to day basis.\n\n166\n00:11:01.024 --> 00:11:03.440\nSo we're adding in a layer.\n\n167\n00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.590\nAn external layer of that.\n\n168\n00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.600\nThat can be difficult to manage.\n\n169\n00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.017\nAnd so\nwe have to ensure that as a customer,\n\n170\n00:11:15.017 --> 00:11:22.642\nwe have to empower that external service\nintegrator to act on our behalf.\n\n171\n00:11:22.642 --> 00:11:23.510\nWe have to empower them.\n\n172\n00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:28.100\nAnd we have to empower them so that\nthe internal service providers, well, so\n\n173\n00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.330\nthat they actually report into\nthat service integrator and\n\n174\n00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.850\nthey don't report direct into\nthe customer organization.\n\n175\n00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.650\nSo, let's just take a look at\nsome characteristics then that\n\n176\n00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.480\nwe have here with an external integrator.\n\n177\n00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.000\nAnd if we can just take\na look on the screen,\n\n178\n00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.580\nyou'll see there are some\nwords in the slide there.\n\n179\n00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.350\nAnd by the way, all of these slides\nare available to you to download, so\n\n180\n00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.370\nyou'll be able to pick these up\nif you're studying for your test.\n\n181\n00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.710\nThen obviously,\nthese are gonna be really useful to you.\n\n182\n00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:05.230\nSo, the external service integrator, the\nlast bullet point there, is exclusively\n\n183\n00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:10.000\nfocused on integration activities and\nthey don't actually perform any work.\n\n184\n00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.299\nThat's an interesting point to make.\n\n185\n00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:17.010\nThey don't perform any of\nthe service provider roles.\n\n186\n00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.414\nSo, when I say that I am for many work,\n\n187\n00:12:19.414 --> 00:12:22.580\nI don't mean that they\ndon't do anything at all.\n\n188\n00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:27.370\nWhat I mean is that, they don't actually\nperform any of the service provider role.\n\n189\n00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.570\nSo they don't do any of\nthe development work and\n\n190\n00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.220\nthey don't do any of the support work.\n\n191\n00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:35.380\nWhat they are doing is purely managing.\n\n192\n00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.540\nAnd this is why right at\nthe beginning of the episode,\n\n193\n00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.560\nwhen I picked Justin up on\nhis use of words there,\n\n194\n00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:46.715\nbecause this was actually about,\nthis is managing our services.\n\n195\n00:12:46.715 --> 00:12:50.555\nManaging our service providers,\nnot necessarily implementing.\n\n196\n00:12:50.555 --> 00:12:55.445\nThe implementation is decided\nby the customer organization.\n\n197\n00:12:55.445 --> 00:12:59.855\nAnd that was something that we looked at\nin a previous episodes where we looked at\n\n198\n00:12:59.855 --> 00:13:04.405\nthe roadmap and the implementation\nof SIAM, and the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n199\n00:13:04.405 --> 00:13:07.130\nAnd that's something that\nwe decided earlier on,\n\n200\n00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:11.190\nwas what we wanted our SIAM\necosystem to look like?\n\n201\n00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.250\nAnd now what we are doing is we are\nselecting an integrator that is going to\n\n202\n00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:20.370\nmanage that SIAM ecosystem for us.\n\n203\n00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:25.380\nSo they are going to manage\nthe relationships between all of\n\n204\n00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:30.230\nour service providers,\nbe they're internal or they're external.\n\n205\n00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.510\nBut, they're not gonna do any of the work.\n\n206\n00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.980\nThey're just going to manage.\n\n207\n00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.030\nThey're managing\nthe relationships between.\n\n208\n00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:41.910\nSo they're making sure that our\nprocesses have an objective.\n\n209\n00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.270\nThat all of our processes are documented.\n\n210\n00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:45.860\nAnd that all or\n\n211\n00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:51.130\nour processes have a consistency across\nall of our service integrators as well.\n\n212\n00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.460\nJustin is looking slightly confused.\n\n213\n00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.750\n&gt;&gt; So I don't know,\nmaybe I am getting a little meta,\n\n214\n00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:59.600\nthere's a risk of me misspeaking here.\n\n215\n00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.330\nSo, our external service integrators\n\n216\n00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.880\nare meant to manage our service providers\nwhether they be internal or external.\n\n217\n00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:14.250\nBut if they're an external entity,\nare they technically an external service\n\n218\n00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:18.830\nprovider that is providing a management\nservice of the other service providers?\n\n219\n00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.860\nOr am I thinking too hard about that?\n\n220\n00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.385\n&gt;&gt; Right!\nNo, you're not thinking too\n\n221\n00:14:22.385 --> 00:14:23.750\nhard about that at all.\n\n222\n00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:27.470\nSo, I'm just gonna go back to\nthis particular slide, okay?\n\n223\n00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:28.910\nSo we can see that there are layers.\n\n224\n00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.770\nSo if you think about this,\nyou're not wrong.\n\n225\n00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:36.740\nSo we've got our customer, and we're going\nto have, and so I like to use the word\n\n226\n00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.250\ncontract, because we've got two\ndifferent types of agreement within IT.\n\n227\n00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.740\nWe've got agreements,\nand we've got contracts.\n\n228\n00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.795\nThe difference being that\nan agreement is an internal document.\n\n229\n00:14:46.795 --> 00:14:51.130\nAn agreement is kind of a,\nit's an umbrella term that we use for\n\n230\n00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:52.580\nany type of document.\n\n231\n00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.732\nBut we'll have an agreement internally\nwith service level targets and\n\n232\n00:14:56.732 --> 00:15:00.480\nwe'll have a contract externally\nwith service level targets.\n\n233\n00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.538\nSo what we have here is,\nwe've got a contract between,\n\n234\n00:15:03.538 --> 00:15:07.770\nbecause it's with an external\norganization, we've got a contract between\n\n235\n00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:11.430\nour customer organization and\nthe external service integrator.\n\n236\n00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:19.320\nAnd then each of those\nexternal service providers\n\n237\n00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:24.660\nwill have their own contract with\nthe external service integrator.\n\n238\n00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.720\nBut interestingly enough,\nthe internal service provider,\n\n239\n00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:33.670\nas you've said, is actually\nexternal to the service integrator.\n\n240\n00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.367\nSo the will also have a contract as well.\n\n241\n00:15:38.502 --> 00:15:40.863\nSo we gonna have a contract that, and\n\n242\n00:15:40.863 --> 00:15:45.597\ncan we see, we can see my cursor here,\nwe gonna have a contract here.\n\n243\n00:15:45.597 --> 00:15:49.952\nWe are also going to have contracts here.\n\n244\n00:15:49.952 --> 00:15:54.902\nAnd we are going to have contracts\nhere as well, because despite\n\n245\n00:15:54.902 --> 00:15:59.770\nthe fact that these service\nproviders internal to these guys.\n\n246\n00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:04.590\nSo we've got a direct link here that\npossibly even set it in the same location.\n\n247\n00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.450\nNevertheless, this layer here is external.\n\n248\n00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.867\nSo all of their relationships\nare going to be contractual.\n\n249\n00:16:13.803 --> 00:16:16.139\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm making sure,-\n\n250\n00:16:16.139 --> 00:16:16.950\n&gt;&gt; I've seen the face.\n\n251\n00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.117\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've see the face.\n\n252\n00:16:18.117 --> 00:16:18.910\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, all right, hold on a second.\n\n253\n00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.853\nSo the customer organization may\nhave internal service providers and\n\n254\n00:16:22.853 --> 00:16:24.060\nthen-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n255\n00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.163\n&gt;&gt; Those internal service providers,\n\n256\n00:16:26.163 --> 00:16:30.368\nif we're talking about external\nservice integrator, then the customer\n\n257\n00:16:30.368 --> 00:16:34.635\norganization would have a contract\nwith external service integrator.\n\n258\n00:16:34.635 --> 00:16:36.240\nMan, there is a lot of words.\n\n259\n00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.363\nAnd then the internal service\nproviders would also have a contract.\n\n260\n00:16:39.363 --> 00:16:45.150\nAnd I'm guessing, I'm trying to think so\nthe one is for management but\n\n261\n00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:50.744\nthen the other contract is for\nfulfillment of services to the service\n\n262\n00:16:50.744 --> 00:16:55.650\nintegrator that maps back to\nthe customer organization?\n\n263\n00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:56.980\nAm I thinking of that right?\n\n264\n00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.807\n&gt;&gt; Right, let's think of this\nin terms of ownership, okay?\n\n265\n00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.590\n&gt;&gt; So if we think about the,- And\nlet's take a look at that slide again.\n\n266\n00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:05.710\nSo we'll put that back up there.\n\n267\n00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:11.537\nSo right at this level here, the customer\norganization owns this contract, okay?\n\n268\n00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.013\nSo they are a customer.\n\n269\n00:17:14.013 --> 00:17:17.710\nThis is a service provider,\nthis is a supplier.\n\n270\n00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:25.340\nBut here at this level,\nthe service integrator owns that.\n\n271\n00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.756\nSo they own that contract.\n\n272\n00:17:26.756 --> 00:17:31.420\nLet's bring in some service level targets\njust to confuse it a little bit more.\n\n273\n00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.290\nSo if I have an incident\nhere at this level.\n\n274\n00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:41.470\nSo customer has an interruption to\nservice, we're gonna put a four-hour\n\n275\n00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:46.290\nresponse target here on\nthis particular contract.\n\n276\n00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:51.040\nSo this means that the External Service\nIntegrator has got to have, well,\n\n277\n00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:55.140\nthey've got to be able to respond\nto that incident within four hours.\n\n278\n00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:03.670\nSo now this External Service Integrator\nhas contract in place here and here.\n\n279\n00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.331\nAnd the targets that they\nhave in place between these,\n\n280\n00:18:08.331 --> 00:18:11.568\nbetween themselves and\nthese service providers,\n\n281\n00:18:11.568 --> 00:18:15.647\nthose targets have got to underpin\nthe four hours that are here.\n\n282\n00:18:18.251 --> 00:18:19.570\nFine.\n\n283\n00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.750\nSo what target would we have here?\n\n284\n00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:29.300\n&gt;&gt; I would think at minimum,\nactually, at maximum four hours.\n\n285\n00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.920\nBut it would have to be under, right?\n\n286\n00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.640\n&gt;&gt; Right, it can't be four hours.\n\n287\n00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.920\nBecause you see-\n&gt;&gt; But that's like too fine of a line,\n\n288\n00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.710\nI would think.\n\n289\n00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.520\n&gt;&gt; Well, no it's impossible,\nyou'd never make it.\n\n290\n00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.920\nBecause you see what happens is\nthe four-hour clock starts ticking here as\n\n291\n00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.100\nsoon as the incident is reported.\n\n292\n00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.440\nWell, by the time the,- Well,\nmy cursor's here.\n\n293\n00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.030\nBy the time the service desk\nhere has logged that call,\n\n294\n00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.590\nyou've done a three hours and\n50 minutes already.\n\n295\n00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:00.084\nSo, you cannot put four hours here because\nyou've already breached that service\n\n296\n00:19:00.084 --> 00:19:00.749\nlevel target.\n\n297\n00:19:00.749 --> 00:19:04.580\nSo it has to be less than\nthe service level target.\n\n298\n00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.460\nNow, I am going to add in more complexity.\n\n299\n00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:12.330\nHow often does an incident get passed\naround between this service provider, and\n\n300\n00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:15.200\nthen this one, and then this one,\nand then over to this one,\n\n301\n00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.670\nand then all of the others,\nthese other service providers?\n\n302\n00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:21.320\nQuite often.\n\n303\n00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:27.290\nSo, all of these,\nthe sum total of all of these\n\n304\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:31.990\nservice level targets has got\nto be less than four hours.\n\n305\n00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:39.080\nBecause this is what it underpins,\nit underpins the four hours here.\n\n306\n00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:44.990\nSo whatever happens from this layer\ndownwards, from that Service Integrator\n\n307\n00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:48.940\ndownwards, whatever happens has\ngot to be less than four hours.\n\n308\n00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:53.570\nWhich means the sum of these guys might\nonly get ten minutes to take a look\n\n309\n00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:54.220\nat an incident.\n\n310\n00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.210\nAnd now we get into\nthe really complex stuff.\n\n311\n00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.630\nBecause the really complex\nstuff says that, okay, well,\n\n312\n00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.860\nwhat if this service provider\nhas that incident for two hours?\n\n313\n00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:10.510\nAnd they spend two hours kinda scratching\ntheir heads wondering what on Earth it is\n\n314\n00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:13.790\ntrying to figure it out before they\nfinally realize that, you know what?\n\n315\n00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:16.020\nThere's nothing I can do about it.\n\n316\n00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.030\nWe've got now one and a half hours left.\n\n317\n00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:23.510\nAnd then somebody else takes it and\nthey say, it's been passed to to the,\n\n318\n00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.490\nI don’t know, maybe it's been passed,-\nMaybe they can’t get into Outlook.\n\n319\n00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.430\nLet's look at a real example,\nthey can’t get into Outlook.\n\n320\n00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:35.180\nSo it's been passed to the people that\nmanage, so Microsoft manage Outlook.\n\n321\n00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.960\nIt's been passed to Microsoft, and\nMicrosoft have had this for say,\n\n322\n00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.490\ntwo hours, and they've said,\nyou know what?\n\n323\n00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.860\nIt's not an Outlook problem,\nand it really isn't.\n\n324\n00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.875\nSo it must be to do with your network.\n\n325\n00:20:44.875 --> 00:20:48.183\nAnd so,\nwe pass that from Microsoft then to say,\n\n326\n00:20:48.183 --> 00:20:52.390\nI don't know, Comcast or Sky or\nwhoever the network is with.\n\n327\n00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.320\nSo it's passed to them.\n\n328\n00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.270\nThey've only got an hour and\na half potentially.\n\n329\n00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.330\nAnd we say and hour and a half because\nthey've probably already sat on it for\n\n330\n00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.220\n20 minutes before they\npassed it over to Microsoft.\n\n331\n00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.110\nSo now it's passed over\nto our network people and\n\n332\n00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.720\nour network people are looking at that and\nscratching their heads.\n\n333\n00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.900\nThey're external, it's an external\norganization and they hold on to it.\n\n334\n00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.040\nAnd they say, right, well,\nwe spent an hour and\n\n335\n00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.810\n15 minutes and\nwe can't find anything wrong.\n\n336\n00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:19.912\nIt needs to go back to Microsoft.\n\n337\n00:21:22.588 --> 00:21:26.278\nSo, does that mean that the clock starts\nticking again when it goes back to\n\n338\n00:21:26.278 --> 00:21:26.942\nMicrosoft?\n\n339\n00:21:26.942 --> 00:21:29.928\nBecause that's what potentially\nMicrosoft could think.\n\n340\n00:21:29.928 --> 00:21:33.600\nThe fact of the matter is,\nas far as this customer is concerned,\n\n341\n00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.900\nhe's got four hours.\n\n342\n00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.610\nAnd if he's got four hours,\nthen that's the longest it should take.\n\n343\n00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.520\nAnd, he doesn't care what happens here.\n\n344\n00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:47.546\nSo, these guys here have got a pivotal\nrole in all of these cuz they've got\n\n345\n00:21:47.546 --> 00:21:52.761\nto make that all of this happens within,\nand I mean within those four hours.\n\n346\n00:21:56.555 --> 00:21:58.400\nNow, I see the face.\n\n347\n00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.180\n&gt;&gt; Joe, every time I think I'm getting\nsomething, I go, man, it's complicated.\n\n348\n00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.224\nThat is, because then, I guess,\n\n349\n00:22:05.224 --> 00:22:09.454\nlike is this External Service Integrator's\nrole to keep their thumb on\n\n350\n00:22:09.454 --> 00:22:13.684\nthose individual service providers\nto make sure like things are moving\n\n351\n00:22:13.684 --> 00:22:17.932\nalong in some kind of expeditious\nmanner in order to hit those targets?\n\n352\n00:22:17.932 --> 00:22:22.731\nBecause that four hours is established\nbetween the External Service Integrator\n\n353\n00:22:22.731 --> 00:22:25.288\nand the customer organization, right?\n\n354\n00:22:25.288 --> 00:22:26.628\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes.\n\n355\n00:22:26.628 --> 00:22:31.240\nSo all the customer's concerned\nabout is the four hours here.\n\n356\n00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.340\nThey've got four hours,\nas far as they're concerned.\n\n357\n00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:39.590\nThey do not care what happens here,\nthey really, really don't.\n\n358\n00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:43.110\nAnd so, we've got this\nExternal Service Integrator and\n\n359\n00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.370\ntheir job is to coordinate all of this.\n\n360\n00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.670\nAnd their job is, as you said,\nto keep their finger on the pulse and\n\n361\n00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:53.020\nmake sure that\nthe coordination is happening.\n\n362\n00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:53.840\nNow, of course,\n\n363\n00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.740\nthat's not as easy as it sounds because\nwe're talking about technology.\n\n364\n00:22:58.740 --> 00:22:59.522\nWe're talking about IT.\n\n365\n00:22:59.522 --> 00:23:03.811\nAnd invariably,\nthe problem with an incident.\n\n366\n00:23:03.811 --> 00:23:07.610\nYeah, I know incidents and\nproblems are two different things.\n\n367\n00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:11.795\nBut the problem with\nan incident is that invariably,\n\n368\n00:23:11.795 --> 00:23:15.706\nif we knew how to fix it and\nhow to restore service.\n\n369\n00:23:15.706 --> 00:23:20.500\nWell, generally, as soon as we know how\nto restore service, we have it restored.\n\n370\n00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.691\nSo, quite often, you'll get asked the\nquestion, well, how long is it gonna take?\n\n371\n00:23:23.691 --> 00:23:25.200\nAnd you don't know.\n\n372\n00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.190\nAnd you don't know until you find\nout what it is that's broken.\n\n373\n00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:29.930\nAnd then once you've\nfound out what's broken,\n\n374\n00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:33.260\nfixing it,\nthat's the relatively easy part.\n\n375\n00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:37.716\nBut it's the passing it around to find\nout what exactly has broken that takes\n\n376\n00:23:37.716 --> 00:23:38.350\nthe time.\n\n377\n00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:42.820\nAnd so, the Service Integrator has\ngot to keep his finger on the pulse.\n\n378\n00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.060\nHe's got to manage all of these people.\n\n379\n00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:51.223\nNow in one respect,\nhaving contract makes it easier.\n\n380\n00:23:51.223 --> 00:23:52.415\nBecause having contracts,\n\n381\n00:23:52.415 --> 00:23:55.451\nat least we've got something legally\nbinding that we can say to people.\n\n382\n00:23:55.451 --> 00:23:59.345\nRight, you have got x amount\nof time to reply to this.\n\n383\n00:23:59.345 --> 00:24:04.080\nHowever, if you've only got four hours,\nand Microsoft decide on it for two hours,\n\n384\n00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.013\nthen it kind of seems unfair, doesn't it,\nto give it to Comcast and say, well, look,\n\n385\n00:24:09.013 --> 00:24:12.109\nI tell you what,\nyou've got an hour to deal with this.\n\n386\n00:24:12.109 --> 00:24:13.290\nIt doesn't seem fair.\n\n387\n00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.690\nAnd then how would you\ncontractualize that?\n\n388\n00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.499\nhow would you put that in a contract?\n\n389\n00:24:21.499 --> 00:24:25.587\nBecause if I'm going to put in a contract\nthat, okay, Microsoft, I'm giving you two\n\n390\n00:24:25.587 --> 00:24:28.894\nhours and then you put in with\nComcast I'm going to give you two hours.\n\n391\n00:24:28.894 --> 00:24:32.095\nAnd then you put in with somebody else or\nwith Dell maybe,\n\n392\n00:24:32.095 --> 00:24:36.230\nI'm going to give you two hours\nbecause you're managing the hardware.\n\n393\n00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:40.115\nBecause if that's the case,\nthen if it has to go through all three,\n\n394\n00:24:40.115 --> 00:24:41.900\nthen that's a six hour total.\n\n395\n00:24:45.196 --> 00:24:47.450\nI'm loving the look on his face.\n\n396\n00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:52.620\nThis is a conversation that I get\ninto generally at the highest levels\n\n397\n00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.590\nwhen I'm standing there\nwith organizations and\n\n398\n00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:01.540\nactually agreeing, and we're trying to\nagree contract terms and conditions, and\n\n399\n00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:07.140\nwe're trying to agree the contractual\npart of service level targets.\n\n400\n00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:11.270\nThis is not an easy dilemma to solve.\n\n401\n00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:12.830\nAnd when you're talking about contracts,\n\n402\n00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:18.000\nI just said to you, that could be be\nfairly easy because it's contractualized.\n\n403\n00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.130\nSo therefore, we can hold them to that.\n\n404\n00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:22.977\nYeah, but that actually doesn't\nwork in our favor either.\n\n405\n00:25:22.977 --> 00:25:27.196\nBecause it is contractualized, they can,\nas a service provider, say, well, look,\n\n406\n00:25:27.196 --> 00:25:29.031\nI've got two hours to deal with this.\n\n407\n00:25:29.031 --> 00:25:33.525\nI don't care that your service level\ntarget between your customer here and\n\n408\n00:25:33.525 --> 00:25:38.790\nyou as an integrator, I don't care that\nthat's been exceeded, I've got two hours.\n\n409\n00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.871\nOnce I have that incident, I've got two\nhours and I'm gonna take my two hours.\n\n410\n00:25:43.475 --> 00:25:50.050\nThis is not as simple as it first seems,\nit never is.\n\n411\n00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:52.750\nAnd when we're talking about IT,\nand I will always joke,\n\n412\n00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.380\nthat you shouldn't\nguarantee anything in IT,\n\n413\n00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:59.550\ncuz you never know what's going\nto go wrong, and that's so true.\n\n414\n00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:04.340\nBut when you're managing,\nhere we've got a contract, and\n\n415\n00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.180\nthen we're effectively\nmanaging subcontractors.\n\n416\n00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.180\nWhether they're internal or\n\n417\n00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.690\nwhether they're external,\ndoesn't make any difference.\n\n418\n00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.190\nThe fact is it's still a nightmare.\n\n419\n00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:18.030\nAnd I wanna then bring in,\nI think about the complexity,\n\n420\n00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.950\nI wanna bring in these\ninternal service providers.\n\n421\n00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:24.830\nYou see, if you've got an external\nservice integrator and\n\n422\n00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.970\nthen these service providers are internal.\n\n423\n00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.150\nAnd I'm not saying that this\nis definitely going to happen,\n\n424\n00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:33.440\nbut this has happened in the past.\n\n425\n00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:39.540\nThen your internal service providers\ncould have a vested interest in\n\n426\n00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:45.170\nmaking the external service integrator\nlook less than favorable, should we say.\n\n427\n00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:51.210\nAnd sometimes that has to\nbe factored in as well.\n\n428\n00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:56.186\nBecause what they want and what would be\neasy for them potentially would be to\n\n429\n00:26:56.186 --> 00:27:00.945\nhave a direct service level agreement\nwith the customer organization.\n\n430\n00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:08.790\nSo sometimes we bring in the politics,\nwith a lowercase p, into this.\n\n431\n00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:11.460\nAnd that doesn't help, either.\n\n432\n00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:14.105\nSo, how's your mind doing right now,\nJustin?\n\n433\n00:27:14.105 --> 00:27:18.110\n&gt;&gt; Well, you always have to add a little\ndash of human behavior to really\n\n434\n00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.690\nstir the pot, so to speak.\n\n435\n00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:26.100\nAnd I'm thinking about these contracts and\ntrying to make these time targets, right?\n\n436\n00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.150\nBecause it's contracted,\n\n437\n00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:32.760\nI'm guessing all of those have\nto be very concrete in nature.\n\n438\n00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.180\nYou can't say, well, if you're\nthe second person to get the issue,\n\n439\n00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.460\nthen you only have an hour.\n\n440\n00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.615\nThat's not some kind of tiered approach.\n\n441\n00:27:39.615 --> 00:27:44.600\nMen, you know what, this seemed like\nan interesting job for a while, but\n\n442\n00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:49.720\nsometimes it seems like you would just\nneed like a set of octopus arms to go, all\n\n443\n00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.220\nright, hold on a second, let me just make\nsure I have all of these things in place.\n\n444\n00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.750\nAnd then when you add the human factor\ninto it, it just, I don't know,\n\n445\n00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.080\nit seems like it might be\nan unwieldy thing, but\n\n446\n00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:03.860\nI guess that's why they can become very\nvaluable to a respective organization.\n\n447\n00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.535\n&gt;&gt; Well, and one of the reasons why\nI corrected you at the beginning,\n\n448\n00:28:07.535 --> 00:28:09.740\ncuz I said, no, it's about managing this.\n\n449\n00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.300\nBecause this is a management role,\n\n450\n00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.980\nthe service integrator\nrole is a management role.\n\n451\n00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.660\nBut they also need to have\nthat technical understanding,\n\n452\n00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:20.000\nbecause if somebody's telling me a story.\n\n453\n00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.920\nOr I haven't done this because of x,\ny and z.\n\n454\n00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.730\nWell, no, I know that that's not true but\nbecause then I know that that's not true,\n\n455\n00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:32.160\nbecause I've analyzed this myself and\nI know that actually this could be done.\n\n456\n00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:37.330\nSo, I expect my service integrator\nto have a technical bias but\n\n457\n00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:40.810\nI also expect my service integrator layer,\nand\n\n458\n00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:44.010\nthat will be a team of people\ninvariably not just one person.\n\n459\n00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:48.680\nBut I expect my service integrator layer\nto be able to manage, it's management.\n\n460\n00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.610\nIt's not just about implementing this,\nyou can implement this and\n\n461\n00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:52.990\nthen leave it to run.\n\n462\n00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:58.240\nThis has to be managed because\notherwise on a daily basis,\n\n463\n00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.990\nevery day, our targets will fail,\nour incident targets will fail.\n\n464\n00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:07.110\nSo this is about, these words that\nwe've used in previous episodes such as\n\n465\n00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:12.340\ncollaboration and ensuring that\nwe've got relationships in place.\n\n466\n00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:18.260\nThis is about having good relationships\nbetween our external service providers and\n\n467\n00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.680\nthe internal service providers, too.\n\n468\n00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.520\nIt's about having relationships.\n\n469\n00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.665\nIt's about having a trust amongst them.\n\n470\n00:29:25.665 --> 00:29:30.480\nThat if I'm passing an incident to,\nsay, Comcast and I'm saying, I'm sorry,\n\n471\n00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.468\nguys, you've only got an hour and a half.\n\n472\n00:29:32.468 --> 00:29:35.708\nIt's having a trust that they're not\ngonna turn around and say right,\n\n473\n00:29:35.708 --> 00:29:39.666\nwell, my contract says I've got two hours,\nand therefore I'm gonna take two hours.\n\n474\n00:29:39.666 --> 00:29:42.210\nSo we have to have a certain\nelement of trust in there.\n\n475\n00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:46.114\nAnd there also has to be\na certain element of flexibility,\n\n476\n00:29:46.114 --> 00:29:50.976\nbecause all of these service providers,\nbe they internal or external,\n\n477\n00:29:50.976 --> 00:29:55.041\nshould be aware that the ultimate\ntarget is for four hours and\n\n478\n00:29:55.041 --> 00:29:59.370\ntherefore something's got to\nhappen within those four hours.\n\n479\n00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.240\nAnd that doesn't mean that we're\njust going to sit there and\n\n480\n00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.550\nstare at the instant until\nthe four hours are elapsed.\n\n481\n00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.400\nSomething has got to happen\nwithin those four hours.\n\n482\n00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:14.280\nPart of the management of this\nparticular role is ensuring\n\n483\n00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.810\nthat no one's pointing\nthe blame at anybody else.\n\n484\n00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:21.870\nThere is a potential, and you bring in the\nhuman nature of this, there is a potential\n\n485\n00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:26.200\nfor somebody to sit down and say,\nhey, look, it's not me, it's them.\n\n486\n00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:32.908\nAnd that is gonna be one of the biggest\npitfalls within this particular\n\n487\n00:30:32.908 --> 00:30:37.900\narrangement with using\nthe external service integrator,\n\n488\n00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:42.090\nis that it would be very, very easy for\nall of our service providers to just seat\n\n489\n00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:45.590\nback and say, hey look,\nit's not me, it's them.\n\n490\n00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:50.088\nEven so much as putting the blame back\nonto the external service integrator.\n\n491\n00:30:50.088 --> 00:30:55.760\nSo, we gotta make sure that, that\nexternal service integrator is empowered\n\n492\n00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:01.960\nto act on behalf of the customer, but is\nalso in a position where they know how to,\n\n493\n00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:07.570\nthey have the capabilities to manage\non behalf of the customer as well.\n\n494\n00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.290\n&gt;&gt; And that seems like a daunting\ntask in and of itself.\n\n495\n00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:17.210\nBut we've been talking about external\nservice integrators here, and\n\n496\n00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:19.676\nas we've seen, it is no easy feat.\n\n497\n00:31:19.676 --> 00:31:23.577\nThere are pros and cons, and we talked\na little bit about those beforehand.\n\n498\n00:31:23.577 --> 00:31:28.078\nBut I feel like we have not even\ntouched the surface of service\n\n499\n00:31:28.078 --> 00:31:30.030\nintegrators in general.\n\n500\n00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.235\nWhere are going from here, Jo?\n\n501\n00:31:31.235 --> 00:31:33.050\n&gt;&gt; Right, in our next episode then,\n\n502\n00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:38.430\njoin us again because we will be looking\nat the internal service integrator and\n\n503\n00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:42.120\nthe role that they play\nwithin the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n504\n00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.604\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm interested to\nsee how these compare and\n\n505\n00:31:44.604 --> 00:31:48.260\ncontrast to the external service\nintegrators that we just taken a look at.\n\n506\n00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.510\nSo, definitely join us back, but for now,\nwe're gonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n507\n00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.670\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n508\n00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:55.442\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n509\n00:31:55.442 --> 00:31:56.758\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n510\n00:31:56.758 -->

00:00:11.665\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.665 --> 00:00:15.853\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone, and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.853 --> 00:00:19.862\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\nwe're continuing on with SIAM Foundation.\n\n6\n00:00:19.862 --> 00:00:24.176\nAnd well, we're gonna be looking\nat internal service integrators,\n\n7\n00:00:24.176 --> 00:00:28.928\nwhich is, well, a nice comparison to\nour previous episode where we looked at\n\n8\n00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:31.660\nexternal service integrators.\n\n9\n00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.680\nThose words somehow don't\nwanna come out of my mouth.\n\n10\n00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.974\nBut luckily we have someone who's a lot\nmore eloquent than I am about this\n\n11\n00:00:36.974 --> 00:00:38.386\nvery topic, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:38.386 --> 00:00:39.241\nHow are you doing today Jo?\n\n13\n00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:40.650\n&gt;&gt; I'm absolutely fine Justin.\n\n14\n00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.491\nHow are you?\n\n15\n00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:42.598\n&gt;&gt; I am doing well as well.\n\n16\n00:00:42.598 --> 00:00:46.670\n&gt;&gt; That was one huge assumption that\nI am more eloquent than you are.\n\n17\n00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.140\n&gt;&gt; Well, about this topic.\n\n18\n00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.006\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:50.432\n&gt;&gt; I'll deal with that again.\n\n20\n00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.220\nYeah, I can tell you that.\n\n21\n00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.070\nWe are gonna be talking about\ninternal service integrators\n\n22\n00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.710\nin this particular episode.\n\n23\n00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.045\nIn a previous episode,\n\n24\n00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:03.997\nthis is part two of our little mini\nseries about service integrators.\n\n25\n00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:08.160\nAnd in our previous episode, we looked\nat external service integrators, and\n\n26\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.322\nwe pretty much blew Justin's mind when\nwe started talking about service level\n\n27\n00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:16.880\ntargets and we talked about managing the\ncomplexity of those service level targets.\n\n28\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.742\nAnd you know what, the same principle\nstill stands when we're talking about our\n\n29\n00:01:21.742 --> 00:01:23.759\ninternal service integrators.\n\n30\n00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.755\nAnd we're also going to talk about those\nhuman factors that come into this as well\n\n31\n00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:30.570\nbecause you can't just ignore them.\n\n32\n00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.170\nOne thing though that I do wanna,\nhow should I say it,\n\n33\n00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.050\nI just wanna remind you of this really.\n\n34\n00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.810\nIf you noticed that in our slide that\nwe've got in front of us right now,\n\n35\n00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.690\nyou'll see that our service integrator\nis actually internal to the customer\n\n36\n00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.420\norganization.\n\n37\n00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.142\nNow, that sometimes comes as a surprise to\npeople because they say well that is part\n\n38\n00:01:53.142 --> 00:01:54.730\nof the customer then.\n\n39\n00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.990\nWell,of course, it is.\n\n40\n00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.130\nIt's internal to the organization.\n\n41\n00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.110\nAnd so an external service integrator is\nexternal to the customer's organization,\n\n42\n00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.230\nand therefore, internal means\ninternal to the organization.\n\n43\n00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:13.003\nIf we were in\nan ITIL Service Management framework,\n\n44\n00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:17.674\nwe would just simply call\nthat a service provider.\n\n45\n00:02:17.674 --> 00:02:18.975\nNothing more than that.\n\n46\n00:02:18.975 --> 00:02:22.006\nWe would call it maybe\nan internal service provider\n\n47\n00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:27.140\ncuz it's internal perhaps to the business\nunit or to the customer organization.\n\n48\n00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.340\nBut nevertheless,\n\n49\n00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.350\nit's just simply the service integrator\nthat's internal to the organization.\n\n50\n00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.300\nSo this is nothing different.\n\n51\n00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.250\nThis is not something that's unique.\n\n52\n00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.600\nThis is just a service integrator\nthat's internal to the organization.\n\n53\n00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:52.220\nWe will still have agreements and\nso here, I'm gonna quiz Justin now.\n\n54\n00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.670\nIn our last episode, we looked at\nexternal service integrators and\n\n55\n00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.400\nwe looked at the fact that between our\ncustomer, if I can found my mouse here,\n\n56\n00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.590\nbetween our customer and\nthe service integrator we had a contract.\n\n57\n00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.990\nSo what do you think that we have\nhere between the customer and\n\n58\n00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.630\nthe service integrator?\n\n59\n00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.450\n&gt;&gt; Because they're internal,\nI'm gonna go out on a limb and say it's\n\n60\n00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.560\nan agreement because it's internal-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n61\n00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.632\n&gt;&gt; To the company.\n\n62\n00:03:16.632 --> 00:03:19.796\n&gt;&gt; So this would be an SLA,\na service level agreement.\n\n63\n00:03:19.796 --> 00:03:24.372\nAnd a service level agreement is\nan agreement between two parties of\n\n64\n00:03:24.372 --> 00:03:29.348\nthe same organization, and it is\nan agreement on the level of service that\n\n65\n00:03:29.348 --> 00:03:33.070\none party will commit to\nprovide to the other.\n\n66\n00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.406\nIt's an agreement on what\nthe other party will accept.\n\n67\n00:03:37.406 --> 00:03:41.870\nSo a service level agreement contains\nall of the targets with which\n\n68\n00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.190\nthe service provider or in this case,\n\n69\n00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.700\nthe service integrator will commit to\ndelivering to this costumer organization.\n\n70\n00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.930\nSo we will still have agreements in place.\n\n71\n00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.580\nSo even though we have got an integrator\nhere, we will still have an agreement.\n\n72\n00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.570\nBecause that agreement\noutlines to the integrator\n\n73\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.450\nwhat levels of service\nare expected by the customer.\n\n74\n00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.790\nNow, a service level agreement is\nan agreement between two parties, and\n\n75\n00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.130\nit lists the roles and\nresponsibilities of both parties.\n\n76\n00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.062\nSo I expect to see things like we'll\ngive you, from the service integrator,\n\n77\n00:04:20.062 --> 00:04:21.997\nwe'll give you the ability to send and\n\n78\n00:04:21.997 --> 00:04:24.979\nreceive email as long as you\ndon't download any viruses.\n\n79\n00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.133\nSo it's the roles and\nresponsibilities of both parties.\n\n80\n00:04:28.133 --> 00:04:31.890\nIt's not just one sided,\nwhich is a common misconception.\n\n81\n00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.370\nBut it's weighted heavily\nin the customer's favor.\n\n82\n00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.580\nThat's not necessarily the case at all.\n\n83\n00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.910\nWhat we should be doing in that SLA is\noutlining the responsibilities of both\n\n84\n00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:42.720\nparties.\n\n85\n00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.100\nSo one of the examples that I gave when we\nwere talking about the external service\n\n86\n00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.100\nprovider is the fact that\nmaybe we will aim to,\n\n87\n00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.220\none of our service level targets was,\nwe will aim to resolve\n\n88\n00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.200\nan incident, or rather I think I said\nrespond to an incident within four hours.\n\n89\n00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.350\nSo that's something that would still\nexist within the service level agreement.\n\n90\n00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.310\nAnd that's something that the internal\nservice integrator will commit to.\n\n91\n00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:17.220\nWe will aim to respond to\na incident within four hours.\n\n92\n00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.500\nSo everything that happens from here on\ndownwards has still got to happen within\n\n93\n00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.840\nthose four hours.\n\n94\n00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.090\nAnd that discussion\nthat we had previously,\n\n95\n00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.980\nin our external service\nintegrator episode still applies.\n\n96\n00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:39.070\nThe only differences here is in\nthis particular relationship.\n\n97\n00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.520\nWe will have a contract here with\nour external service providers\n\n98\n00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.530\nbecause they are external,\nand here we will have an SLA.\n\n99\n00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.700\nAnd that will be an SLA between\nthe service integrator and\n\n100\n00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.980\nthe internal service providers.\n\n101\n00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.360\nWe still get that same complexity.\n\n102\n00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.250\nSo the complexity that we took from\nour external service integrator,\n\n103\n00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.780\nwhich is that complexity of well,\nwhat happens?\n\n104\n00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.360\nWe've got four hours, that means that\neverything has got to happen underneath\n\n105\n00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.090\nthis particular point in those four\nhours including passing around between\n\n106\n00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.420\nall of the external service providers and\nall of the internal service providers.\n\n107\n00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.890\nAll of that has got to happen\nwithin those four hours.\n\n108\n00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.231\nSo we have to have that flexibility.\n\n109\n00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:32.647\nWe have to have an understanding and\na trust and collaboration between all\n\n110\n00:06:32.647 --> 00:06:38.079\nof our service providers that allows\nus to achieve that four hour target.\n\n111\n00:06:39.986 --> 00:06:45.326\nOne thing that we do know, though,\nis that an internal service integrator is,\n\n112\n00:06:45.326 --> 00:06:48.290\nwell, they're internal to the customer.\n\n113\n00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:53.750\nAnd therefore,\nwe know that they are privy to all of\n\n114\n00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:59.670\nthe strategy decisions and all of\nthe workings of the customer organization.\n\n115\n00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:06.570\nThey are also likely to have some\nform of direct link into the internal\n\n116\n00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.660\nservice providers, possibly by way of\nmaybe an internal messaging system,\n\n117\n00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:18.160\nmaybe an internal directory, etc.\n\n118\n00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.726\nSo there will be a tendency for\n\n119\n00:07:20.726 --> 00:07:25.969\nthis relationship to be a very,\nvery mature relationship.\n\n120\n00:07:27.856 --> 00:07:32.693\nThat can work to a detriment as\nwell because it's not unusual for\n\n121\n00:07:32.693 --> 00:07:36.830\nthese guys to rely on\nthat good relationship.\n\n122\n00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.987\nWhereas here,\nwe've got contractual obligations.\n\n123\n00:07:39.987 --> 00:07:43.911\nAnd therefore, the contractual\nobligations, to a certain extent,\n\n124\n00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:47.310\nare easier to manage when we've\ngot internal obligations.\n\n125\n00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:52.257\nThey're not necessarily as easy to manage,\nbecause I don't expect to see\n\n126\n00:07:52.257 --> 00:07:56.390\npenalties and\nincentives in service level agreements.\n\n127\n00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.190\nI expect to see penalties and\nincentives in contrast.\n\n128\n00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.400\nAnd it may well be that in a contract\nbecause we are paying in a contract so\n\n129\n00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:11.570\nthen we may, well, there's a danger\nthat we might uphold or rather\n\n130\n00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.410\nwe might hold these guys accountable,\nthe external, I've lost my mouse here.\n\n131\n00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.480\nThe external service providers,\nthey may be held to higher standards than\n\n132\n00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.270\nsay the internal service providers because\nthey've got penalties and incentives.\n\n133\n00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.740\nNow, that is not something\nthat we would advocate.\n\n134\n00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.970\nThat is something that we would say no,\n\n135\n00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:33.980\nevery single one of our service provider\nhas to be treated exactly the same.\n\n136\n00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.210\nAnd Justin is itching to ask something.\n\n137\n00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.810\n&gt;&gt; So I think we're back to\nthis human factors, right.\n\n138\n00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:47.210\nIs this kind of, well, I know you,\nlet's say there's some person named Bobby.\n\n139\n00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.850\nAnd you're like I know you, Bobby,\nI know you tried your best.\n\n140\n00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.600\nBut then, if it was an external one,\nyou're like,\n\n141\n00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.920\nno this is what we agreed upon.\n\n142\n00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.890\nI've seen people do this, not necessarily\nin this context, where you have\n\n143\n00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.600\ndifferent facets of rigidity based\non the personal relationships.\n\n144\n00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.760\nAnd I think I've seen that\nbecome an incredible detriment.\n\n145\n00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:14.240\nBecause Bobby goes, Justin,\nhe's gonna let me slide a little bit.\n\n146\n00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.530\nAnd ultimately, that can lead to just\nhorrible things within the company\n\n147\n00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:25.120\nespecially if you have an unbalanced\napplication of expectations.\n\n148\n00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really can cause issues.\n\n149\n00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.690\nIt can cause issues when we've got\nexternal service integrators in that\n\n150\n00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:38.540\nexternal service integrators\ncould have a bias to favor one\n\n151\n00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:43.140\nparticular partner, as it were,\none particular service provider.\n\n152\n00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.620\nBut certainly within the internal\nservice providers, the internal service\n\n153\n00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.110\nintegrator, in that relationship,\nwe've gotta be very, very careful.\n\n154\n00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:55.460\nYou've got to manage\nthe relationship Impartially.\n\n155\n00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.240\nAnd that's really important.\n\n156\n00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:03.130\nAnd this is why a lot of organizations,\ncustomer organizations, will go to\n\n157\n00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:08.180\nthe external service integrator role,\npurely because they've got that\n\n158\n00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:13.090\nlevel of impartiality there that you don't\nhave with the internal service integrator.\n\n159\n00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:16.658\nIt's really easy to pick up the phone and\ncall Bobby, or call Fred, and just say,\n\n160\n00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:19.160\nwell, you know what,\nhe's gonna help me out.\n\n161\n00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.820\nIt's really easy to do that.\n\n162\n00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.240\nAnd so that's not something\nthat we want to encourage.\n\n163\n00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:29.540\nWe've got to have a consistency in our way\nof working right the way across the board.\n\n164\n00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.690\nWe've gotta deliver a consistent\nservice to our customers.\n\n165\n00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.440\n&gt;&gt; And I can see that, right?\n\n166\n00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.920\nSo the external ones provided a more\n\n167\n00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.030\nhigher level of consistency between\ntwo types of service providers.\n\n168\n00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:47.965\nBut then now, we're balancing that\nwith internal systems integrators,\n\n169\n00:10:47.965 --> 00:10:51.590\nor service integrators, excuse me.\n\n170\n00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:55.250\nThey're gonna have more insight to\nwhat needs to happen in kind of\n\n171\n00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.250\nthe business use case.\n\n172\n00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.251\nSo it's kind of this odd\nbalance of which one, and\n\n173\n00:10:59.251 --> 00:11:02.477\nI'm not saying these always\noccur in pairs, right?\n\n174\n00:11:02.477 --> 00:11:03.062\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n175\n00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:06.377\n&gt;&gt; But it is a consideration,\nwhich one is more valuable,\n\n176\n00:11:06.377 --> 00:11:09.280\nwhich one is most applicable\nto your situation.\n\n177\n00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.267\nThis seems very context-specific,\n\n178\n00:11:11.267 --> 00:11:14.940\ndepending on a respective customer\norganization's circumstance.\n\n179\n00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's part of\nthe consideration of the implementation.\n\n180\n00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.840\nIn our previous episode, we looked at that\nroad map in the implementation road map.\n\n181\n00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.860\nWe worked in the stage where we planned,\nwhere we designed and\n\n182\n00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.372\nwe planned for the ecosystem itself.\n\n183\n00:11:30.372 --> 00:11:32.780\nIt's certainly a consideration\nthat you have to make.\n\n184\n00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.880\nLet's consider things\nlike data protection.\n\n185\n00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.630\nLet's consider legislation and\nlegal requirements, for instance.\n\n186\n00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:45.050\nNow, an internal service integrator\nmay have access to that data.\n\n187\n00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.810\nThey may have access to that information.\n\n188\n00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:53.350\nWhereas, an external service integrator,\nwe may not even by law be allowed to give\n\n189\n00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:59.080\nthem access to certain things because\nthey are outside of our organization.\n\n190\n00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.680\nI'm considering things like, you know\nin certain financial institutions.\n\n191\n00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.420\nThis is not a legal requirement but\n\n192\n00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:10.080\nthere's generally a reluctance to share\ndata with external organizations.\n\n193\n00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.970\nBut certainly, in governments,\nthere is a legal requirement but\n\n194\n00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:18.990\nwe don't share information to external\norganizations unless they have\n\n195\n00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:24.140\ngone through certain security\nclearance as beforehand.\n\n196\n00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:30.190\nSo it’s not necessarily as easy to bring\nin an external service integrator.\n\n197\n00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.942\nAnd it may well be, and\nthis is where it works very,\n\n198\n00:12:32.942 --> 00:12:35.950\nvery well and if we can bring\nthese slides back up again,\n\n199\n00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:40.262\nyou'll see that an internal service\nintegrator in a government environment.\n\n200\n00:12:40.262 --> 00:12:44.331\nWhat we are able to do is add in\nthat flexibility where we can.\n\n201\n00:12:44.331 --> 00:12:49.420\nAnything that is protected, we can give\nto the internal service providers.\n\n202\n00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:54.115\nAnd anything that is not protected, that\nis not subject to security clearance, or\n\n203\n00:12:54.115 --> 00:12:56.943\nwe could give to the external\nservice providers.\n\n204\n00:12:56.943 --> 00:13:02.157\nSo, for instance, if we are managing\na service desk environment, then the data\n\n205\n00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:07.076\nthat's on the core login system which\nis the data of our individual people.\n\n206\n00:13:07.076 --> 00:13:10.607\nWell, that would stay with\nthe internal service providers, but\n\n207\n00:13:10.607 --> 00:13:15.037\nmaybe our external service provider would\nprovide us with our telephone system or\n\n208\n00:13:15.037 --> 00:13:17.520\nmight provide us with our network.\n\n209\n00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.330\nBut not have any access to any data.\n\n210\n00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.510\nSo it does work.\n\n211\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:29.190\nThe decision is made during as\npart of the business case and\n\n212\n00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:33.320\nduring the planning for\nimplementing the ecosystem but\n\n213\n00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:39.090\nit does work as long as we understand why,\nwhat the purpose is for this.\n\n214\n00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:44.150\nThe external service integrator will give\nyou the impartiality across the board.\n\n215\n00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:48.920\nThe internal service integrator,\nyeah, there's a tendency for\n\n216\n00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.902\nthem to perhaps not to be so impartial.\n\n217\n00:13:52.902 --> 00:13:54.670\nThere's also a tendency and\n\n218\n00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:59.310\njust as a complete different topic really,\nthere's a tendency for\n\n219\n00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.410\nus to perceive that the internal\nservice provider in this particular\n\n220\n00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:08.380\ninstance will give us better service or\nthey will give us faster service.\n\n221\n00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.700\nAnd that's because we are all\nsort of together collectively\n\n222\n00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.960\nin the same organization,\nmaybe even in the same building.\n\n223\n00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.190\nAnd there is a perception there that\nwe don't get as a good service from\n\n224\n00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:22.614\nthe external service providers and\nactually the converse might be true.\n\n225\n00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:29.430\nSo we have to, as part of planning for\nthis, we have to decide which\n\n226\n00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:34.780\nwe are going to want to implement whether\nit is gonna be somebody internal,\n\n227\n00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.210\nor whether it is gonna\nbe somebody external.\n\n228\n00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.240\nAnd when we come back and\nlook at future episodes,\n\n229\n00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.940\nwe'll look at the lead supplier and\nwe'll look at the hybrid structure.\n\n230\n00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:51.180\nAnd we'll look a little bit more about\nhow we can balance some of those pros and\n\n231\n00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:57.720\ncons to try and give us the best\nperception and the best service as well.\n\n232\n00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.880\nWe have to consider that what we're trying\nto do is deliver value to our customers.\n\n233\n00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.840\nAnd so we've got to understand,\nfirst of all, what our customers value.\n\n234\n00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.000\nAnd if our customers are valuing security,\n\n235\n00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.520\nthen maybe the internal service\nintegrator is the best solution.\n\n236\n00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:18.290\nBut if our customers\nare valuing impartiality, and\n\n237\n00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:23.770\nthey want quickness of service then\nperhaps because of the skills, etc.\n\n238\n00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:25.910\nAnd because of the scalability,\n\n239\n00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:30.990\nthen an external service integrator\nis what they would choose.\n\n240\n00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:34.970\nRemember in our last episode,\nwe looked at the pros and\n\n241\n00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:39.110\ncons of an internal service integrator and\nof an external service integrator.\n\n242\n00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:43.305\nCan you remember what the sort of the pros\nwere of an internal service integrator?\n\n243\n00:15:43.305 --> 00:15:44.718\n&gt;&gt; They're closer to\nyour business use case,\n\n244\n00:15:44.718 --> 00:15:46.239\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n245\n00:15:46.239 --> 00:15:51.729\n&gt;&gt; They are are kind of privy\nto how things are going to work.\n\n246\n00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:57.040\nThey are not, Jo, I am blanking.\n\n247\n00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.960\nThere was, I think there was one more.\n\n248\n00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:04.475\nThey, I lost it Jo.\n\n249\n00:16:04.475 --> 00:16:05.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was on a roll there, [LAUGH] and\n\n250\n00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.135\nI was like wait a minute,\nI can't think of it.\n\n251\n00:16:08.135 --> 00:16:12.410\n&gt;&gt; No, and that's okay, because there's\nno right or wrong in any given situation.\n\n252\n00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:16.780\nYou have to do a maybe a SWOT analysis,\nStrengths, Weaknesses,\n\n253\n00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:17.980\nOpportunities, and Threats.\n\n254\n00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.070\nYou have to weigh up the pros and\ncons, the advantages and\n\n255\n00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.790\ndisadvantages in every\nsingle circumstance.\n\n256\n00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:28.804\nSo in essence, the internal service\nintegrator is going to be potentially\n\n257\n00:16:28.804 --> 00:16:32.943\nmore responsive because they\nunderstand the environment and\n\n258\n00:16:32.943 --> 00:16:35.980\nthey are potentially\nthere with your users.\n\n259\n00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.810\nThe internal service integrator is also\ngoing to have an awareness of your\n\n260\n00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:43.080\nbusiness and an awareness of\nthe culture of your business and\n\n261\n00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.510\nthe culture of the environment as well.\n\n262\n00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:51.060\nWhereas an external service integrator is\ngoing to have the scalability on skills.\n\n263\n00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.230\nThey're going to have,\nthey're gonna be cheaper.\n\n264\n00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:57.990\nThey're going to have\nthe ability to retrain.\n\n265\n00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:00.900\nThey're going to have\nresilience built-in as well, so\n\n266\n00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:05.450\nthat if somebody is out sick,\nthen somebody else can step in.\n\n267\n00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:10.150\nBut, of course, then the internal\nservice integrator has that security and\n\n268\n00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:16.320\nhas the assurance that we're all\npart of the same organization.\n\n269\n00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:21.007\nAnd therefore, we're all going to have the\nsame level of consideration when it comes\n\n270\n00:17:21.007 --> 00:17:22.189\nto data protection.\n\n271\n00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:27.727\nThere's always a weariness in place with\nexternal service integrators in there.\n\n272\n00:17:27.727 --> 00:17:30.259\nYou're very concerned\nabout data protection, and\n\n273\n00:17:30.259 --> 00:17:32.220\nwhat's going to happen with your data.\n\n274\n00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:36.310\nAnd, of course, don't forget with\nexternal service integrators,\n\n275\n00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.920\nyou're gonna bring in\nsomeone who has experience.\n\n276\n00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.290\nAnd so therefore, they're probably\ngonna have all the customers.\n\n277\n00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.250\nSo there's always going to\nbe that question, as to\n\n278\n00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:52.190\nwhere we sit on the pecking order as it\nwere with an external service integrator.\n\n279\n00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:58.910\nUltimately, there is\nno set answer to this.\n\n280\n00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.710\nThere's no right or wrong.\n\n281\n00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:05.550\nYou have to consider the environment\nthat you're in and what you want\n\n282\n00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:10.510\nfrom your ecosystem before you can make\na decision whether to remain in house\n\n283\n00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:15.520\nwith a service integrator, or whether to\ngo external for a service integrator.\n\n284\n00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.470\nBut in our next episode,\nwe're actually going to look\n\n285\n00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:22.210\nat the hybrid service integrator,\nwhich is kind of a mixture of both.\n\n286\n00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:26.580\nAnd we're also going to look at\na lead supply option as well.\n\n287\n00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.490\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jo, this is,\nwe just keep getting deep.\n\n288\n00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:35.230\nIt's mud above my eyes because we've\ntalked about the things that internal and\n\n289\n00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:40.200\nexternal are respectively possible good\nat, based on perception or actuality.\n\n290\n00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.290\nBut I could always think of a scenario\nwhere the opposite could be true, right?\n\n291\n00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:48.372\nLike an external may be more applicable\nfor data security because they have\n\n292\n00:18:48.372 --> 00:18:51.369\na different set of skills\nthan internal Individuals.\n\n293\n00:18:51.369 --> 00:18:55.640\nSo I'm kind of interested to see how this\nhybrid works out because the way my mind's\n\n294\n00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.397\nworking, that might actually\nfulfill all my needs.\n\n295\n00:18:58.397 --> 00:19:01.100\nBut I'm sure there's complexity\nthat comes along with that.\n\n296\n00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.190\nSo definitely, join us back, but for now\nwe're gonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n297\n00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.372\nSo, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n298\n00:19:07.372 --> 00:19:08.369\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n299\n00:19:08.369 --> 00:19:10.577\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

00:00:12.801\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings, everyone,\n\n4\n00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:15.403\nand welcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.403 --> 00:00:16.793\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\n\n6\n00:00:16.793 --> 00:00:19.550\nwe're coming back at you\nwith more SIAM foundation.\n\n7\n00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.855\nAnd well, over the last couple of\nepisodes, we've talked about external and\n\n8\n00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:24.268\ninternal service integrators.\n\n9\n00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:28.429\nAnd now we're gonna be talking about\nhybrid service integrators, and\n\n10\n00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.350\nhopefully it makes as much\nsense as I hope it does.\n\n11\n00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.236\nBut here's someone that's gonna help\nus sense of all of those things,\n\n12\n00:00:35.236 --> 00:00:36.091\nMs Jo Peacock.\n\n13\n00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:38.380\nHow're you doing today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you,\n\n14\n00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.565\nJustin, how are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic as well.\n\n15\n00:00:41.565 --> 00:00:46.680\nAnd over the last few episodes, I've been\ntussling these around in my brain and\n\n16\n00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.030\ntrying not to get a nosebleed.\n\n17\n00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.530\nAnd I've got questions, and\nthen they were answered, and\n\n18\n00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.086\nthen I ended up with more questions.\n\n19\n00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:57.713\nAnd I think hybrid approach may\nfit with my mindset a little more,\n\n20\n00:00:57.713 --> 00:00:59.359\nbut I don't know.\n\n21\n00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.680\nWe'll have to wait and see.\n\n22\n00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.080\nBut is hybrid service integrators,\nare they really just like they sound?\n\n23\n00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.010\nWe're just taking the two approaches and\n\n24\n00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.070\nkinda marrying those together?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, kind of, yeah, we are.\n\n25\n00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.210\nWe're gonna just simply take the best\nparts from the internal service integrator\n\n26\n00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.380\nand from the external service integrator,\nand we are gonna marry those together.\n\n27\n00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.830\nSo what do we mean by the best parts,\nexactly?\n\n28\n00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.090\nWell, if you will take\na look at the diagram,\n\n29\n00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.640\nyou'll notice that the diagram that\nwe have on our slides is very,\n\n30\n00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.160\nvery similar to the initial diagram\nthat we had in our first episode\n\n31\n00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.590\nin this kind of mini series, where we\nlooked at the external service integrator.\n\n32\n00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.711\nNow when the internal service integrator,\n\n33\n00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:49.447\nthe service integrator sat very firmly\nhere inside the customer organization,\n\n34\n00:01:49.447 --> 00:01:55.560\nwhereas now we've kinda got them\noutside of the customer organization.\n\n35\n00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.000\nI think what I'd like to\ndo because we can't really,\n\n36\n00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.040\nunfortunately, it's difficult to depict.\n\n37\n00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.610\nThis is just one option, but the other\noption is to have this completely blue,\n\n38\n00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.890\nbut then sat inside\nthe customer organization.\n\n39\n00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.090\nOr rather, it's sort of a mixture of both,\nbut sat inside.\n\n40\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.445\nHybrid structure is generally\na service integrator that\n\n41\n00:02:20.445 --> 00:02:27.500\nsits inside the customer organization, but\nthe work is done by contractors, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.110\nDoes that make sense?\n&gt;&gt; So the work as far as the management of\n\n43\n00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.590\nthe other external and internal\nservice providers are contracted out.\n\n44\n00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.030\nBut kind of the overseer, the foreman\nof those said contractors is internal?\n\n45\n00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.060\nDo I have all the pieces?\n\n46\n00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.276\nYou're kinda giving me this weird glance,\nJo.\n\n47\n00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:47.423\n&gt;&gt; Right, I am giving you a weird look,\n\n48\n00:02:47.423 --> 00:02:50.612\nbecause it's a difficult one\nto get your head around,\n\n49\n00:02:50.612 --> 00:02:55.324\nand I know that you thought that when we\ngot into this particular sort of episode,\n\n50\n00:02:55.324 --> 00:02:59.098\nyou thought,\neverything's gonna be all suddenly clear.\n\n51\n00:02:59.098 --> 00:03:02.802\nAnd unfortunately no,\n[LAUGH] I can't say that it is.\n\n52\n00:03:02.802 --> 00:03:06.120\nI'm gonna try and\nmake it as clear as I possibly can.\n\n53\n00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.825\nIn an external service integrator,\nwhat we've done is, we have gone outside.\n\n54\n00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:15.430\nWe've gone outside of the organization,\nand by we, I mean the business,\n\n55\n00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.650\nI mean the customer.\n\n56\n00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.212\nWe've gone outside of the organization,\nand\n\n57\n00:03:20.212 --> 00:03:26.159\nwe have created a contract that we have\nwith an external service integrator.\n\n58\n00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:31.180\nAnd we have said we would like\nyou to manage our IT services.\n\n59\n00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.160\nHere are a bunch of service providers.\n\n60\n00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.940\nSome of them are internal,\nsome of them are external.\n\n61\n00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.430\nWe want you to manage\nthem all on our behalf.\n\n62\n00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.450\nBut you're over there.\n\n63\n00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.500\nYou're in your own environment and\nyour set's over there.\n\n64\n00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.711\nYou are an external company, and\n\n65\n00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:52.421\nwe acknowledge that you\nhave got other clients.\n\n66\n00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:56.770\nThat make sense, so far?\n&gt;&gt; It does, I think.\n\n67\n00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.940\nIt's one of those things where I'm not\nentirely sure it all makes sense yet.\n\n68\n00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.060\nSo I'm gonna let you continue on this one,\nand as long as my nose doesn't start\n\n69\n00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.470\nbleeding, I think we'll be all right.\n&gt;&gt; If I see his head explode, I'll run for\n\n70\n00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.130\nthe door, okay?\n\n71\n00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.870\nIf I'm no longer here when you come to me,\n\n72\n00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.170\nthen it's because it's got\na bit too much for Justin.\n\n73\n00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.110\nSo an external service integrator then\nis where we've gone to an external\n\n74\n00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.830\norganization, physically located outside\nof our organization, for example.\n\n75\n00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.743\nAnd we've said to them,\nwe know that you've got other customers.\n\n76\n00:04:29.743 --> 00:04:34.520\nWe know that you've got other work on,\nbut we'd like you to do this for us.\n\n77\n00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.930\nSo you will be our management.\n\n78\n00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.759\nSo you will sit here, and you will\nmanage all of these service providers.\n\n79\n00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.540\nBut you're gonna do the management, and\nyou're gonna be sat in your environment,\n\n80\n00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.810\nand we understand that you're gonna\nbe managing other customers as well.\n\n81\n00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.687\nThe internal service integrator,\nit's completely the opposite.\n\n82\n00:04:55.687 --> 00:05:00.420\nThe internal service integrator is\npart of the customer environment.\n\n83\n00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.799\nIt's part of our environment.\n\n84\n00:05:01.799 --> 00:05:06.461\nIt's a team within our environment, and\nit's a team of people where we say,\n\n85\n00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:11.240\nhey, look, you've got 15 different\nservice providers, manage them.\n\n86\n00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.613\nSome of them are internal,\nsome of them are external.\n\n87\n00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:16.560\nYou might consider this to\nbe a traditional approach.\n\n88\n00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.310\nIt's similar to the traditional approach,\nyes.\n\n89\n00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.030\nSo you might consider the internal service\nintegrator to be a very traditional type\n\n90\n00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.570\napproach.\n\n91\n00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.270\nIt's more than just a contract manager,\n\n92\n00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.740\nit's not that because you have to\nmanage this on a day today basis.\n\n93\n00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.680\nSo we've got external,\nwhich is completely external.\n\n94\n00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.964\nYou got internal which is completely,\nwell, I was gonna use the word bespoke.\n\n95\n00:05:42.964 --> 00:05:48.480\nIt's tailor made to us, our internal\nservice integrator only works for us.\n\n96\n00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.060\nThey're internal to our organization.\n\n97\n00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:52.970\nAnd then you've got the hybrid.\n\n98\n00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.230\nAnd the hybrid would be, for example, and\nI'm talking about a mixture of the two.\n\n99\n00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:05.219\nSo as an example, a hybrid would be where\nwe have got a service integrator,but\n\n100\n00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:11.497\nthey're employed on a contractual basis,\nso they're not full time employees.\n\n101\n00:06:11.497 --> 00:06:16.962\nThey're sat here within our organization\nand they don't have any other customers.\n\n102\n00:06:16.962 --> 00:06:21.414\nSo almost like when we're bringing\nin contractors to fill roles that\n\n103\n00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:26.877\nare normally undertaken by full time\nemployees, we're bringing in contractors.\n\n104\n00:06:26.877 --> 00:06:29.575\nWe treat them like they\nare full time employees.\n\n105\n00:06:29.575 --> 00:06:31.075\nWe treat them like they're ours, and\n\n106\n00:06:31.075 --> 00:06:35.545\nthey're undertaking roles in the same\nway that our full time employees do.\n\n107\n00:06:35.545 --> 00:06:38.585\nThey're privy to exactly the same\ninformation that our full time\n\n108\n00:06:38.585 --> 00:06:39.775\nemployees are.\n\n109\n00:06:39.775 --> 00:06:43.010\nBut they're still on a contract.\n\n110\n00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.560\nIt's not a full time employee,\nit's still on a contract.\n\n111\n00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.045\nYeah, you understand how that works,\n\n112\n00:06:48.045 --> 00:06:50.777\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it may seem like an odd approach\n\n113\n00:06:50.777 --> 00:06:56.531\nfor some individuals, but I've worked with\ncompanies where you work alongside people.\n\n114\n00:06:56.531 --> 00:07:00.071\nI've actually worked with people that\nI thought were full time employees and\n\n115\n00:07:00.071 --> 00:07:03.893\ncome to find out they're just contractors\nthat are fulfilling a particular role.\n\n116\n00:07:03.893 --> 00:07:06.957\nAnd some of that has to do with\nflexibility of the current needs or\n\n117\n00:07:06.957 --> 00:07:10.440\nmaybe some kind of transitional\nneeds of the respective company.\n\n118\n00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.160\nWhich brings up a question, is this\ntypically employed during a transition\n\n119\n00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.160\nfrom internal to external, or\nis it always is it to provide some\n\n120\n00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.630\nflexibility that I don't get\nwith just the either internal or\n\n121\n00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.040\nexternal approach only?\n&gt;&gt; It's about flexibility.\n\n122\n00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.830\nIt's a conscious decision,\nit's not generally used within transition.\n\n123\n00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.254\nOnce we've got this eco structure,\nthis ecosystem in place,\n\n124\n00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:38.860\nwe don't wanna use the ecosystem itself\nas a transition to something else.\n\n125\n00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.890\nWhat we don't wanna do\nis bring instability.\n\n126\n00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.620\nWe've already got instability.\n\n127\n00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.401\nThat's probably one of the main\ndrivers for moving to the ecosystem,\n\n128\n00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:51.695\nis the fact that the current environment,\nwhether it's an idle environment or\n\n129\n00:07:51.695 --> 00:07:53.956\nISO 20,000-based environment.\n\n130\n00:07:53.956 --> 00:07:57.047\nThe current environment is\ngenerally not providing us with\n\n131\n00:07:57.047 --> 00:07:58.723\nthe efficiencies that we need.\n\n132\n00:07:58.723 --> 00:07:59.839\nSo we need to evolve.\n\n133\n00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:01.856\nWe need to move to something else.\n\n134\n00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:05.075\nWhat we don't wanna a do is move to\nsomething that's just transitional.\n\n135\n00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:08.450\nWe want to transition to the ecosystem.\n\n136\n00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:14.270\nNow this particular approach, it's\nexactly the same as some organizations\n\n137\n00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.990\nwill bring in contractors just purely for\nthe duration of a project for instance.\n\n138\n00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.700\nAnd they'll bring in contractors because,\n\n139\n00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.620\nwe don't have the overhead that\nwe have with full time employees.\n\n140\n00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.380\nDepending on where in the world you are,\nyou may have overheads like private\n\n141\n00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:33.950\nhealthcare, you may have sick pay,\nyou may have holiday vacation pay, etc.\n\n142\n00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.820\nSo when you're bringing\nin somebody contractual,\n\n143\n00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.090\nyou don't have all of those overheads.\n\n144\n00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:43.860\nYou also don't have the responsibility for\nkeeping that person trained and\n\n145\n00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.250\nfor keeping their skill levels up to date.\n\n146\n00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.210\nNow bear in mind that efficiency, well,\n\n147\n00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.450\nwe're focusing on three\nfactors with efficiency.\n\n148\n00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:56.010\nWe're focusing on minimal waste in\nterms of time and money and skills.\n\n149\n00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:02.603\nSo we have to make sure that\nthe hybrid service integrator,\n\n150\n00:09:02.603 --> 00:09:08.030\nwell any service integrator\nhas the right level of skills.\n\n151\n00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:14.460\nSo using what is, in essence,\ncontract staff in a contract\n\n152\n00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:20.275\nteam in house gives us the benefits\nthat ordinary contract staff would.\n\n153\n00:09:20.275 --> 00:09:26.605\nSo, they're on site, they have full\naccess to absolutely everything.\n\n154\n00:09:26.605 --> 00:09:27.505\nAnd as Justin says,\n\n155\n00:09:27.505 --> 00:09:32.535\nyou may not even know that they\nare not part of our organization.\n\n156\n00:09:32.535 --> 00:09:36.770\nThey have full access to\nabsolutely everything, but\n\n157\n00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:41.270\nwe all know they're not responsible as a\ncustomer organization for their training.\n\n158\n00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.800\nWe're not responsible for\n\n159\n00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.930\ncertain benefits that may come\nwith being full time employees.\n\n160\n00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:52.829\nYou may find that in terms of transition,\nyou mentioned transition, you might find\n\n161\n00:09:52.829 --> 00:09:56.976\nthat this team of people may transition\nto become full time employees.\n\n162\n00:09:56.976 --> 00:09:59.994\nI've seen that happen in the past, but\n\n163\n00:09:59.994 --> 00:10:05.830\nI've never seen this employee that's\njust a transitional structure.\n\n164\n00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.620\nThis is something that is definitely\na conscious decision where\n\n165\n00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:14.510\nthe customer will say,\nwell we need to have a service integrator.\n\n166\n00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:18.430\nBut we don't want the overhead,\nwe don't want\n\n167\n00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:23.400\nthe stress of keeping everybody trained or\nmaking sure that we're up to date with\n\n168\n00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.060\nour current practices.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n169\n00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.480\nmaybe I should clarify what\nI meant by transitional.\n\n170\n00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.078\nNot transitional from SIAM as kind\nof the kind of the methodology,\n\n171\n00:10:32.078 --> 00:10:36.120\nbut transitional as I'm moving\nthrough that evolution.\n\n172\n00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.600\nAnd I don't know if I'm\ngonna go with internal,\n\n173\n00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.390\nI don't know if I'm gonna go external.\n\n174\n00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:46.750\nSo maybe I kind of have this,\nwell, this hybrid approach\n\n175\n00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.990\nwith either making the decision to\nmake them full time employees, and\n\n176\n00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.460\nI become an integral part of the team.\n\n177\n00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:55.700\nAnd they're no longer partially external,\nor you're like,\n\n178\n00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.580\nyou're not fulfilling our services,\nwe're going to go with an external one.\n\n179\n00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:03.290\nOr once this is set in place,\ndo you kinda get some rigidity in this?\n\n180\n00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.060\n&gt;&gt; I'm always a bit worried when\n\n181\n00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.620\nI hear people say to me, and\nI'm glad that you brought this up,\n\n182\n00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.900\nbecause I'm always worried when I\nhear people say to me about, well,\n\n183\n00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.210\nwe kinda really don't wanna know.\n\n184\n00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:17.320\nSo we wanna dip our toe in the water and\nwe're gonna try this.\n\n185\n00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.340\nBecause, if you were in that\nposition where you don't know,\n\n186\n00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.180\nit's telling me that maybe you\nare not ready to make a commitment.\n\n187\n00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.110\nYou know, you know what you want to,\n\n188\n00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.675\nthis is not a relationship I advice by\nthe way, I just want to go into that.\n\n189\n00:11:31.675 --> 00:11:34.694\n[LAUGH] You know that things\nhave got to change but\n\n190\n00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:37.650\nyou don't know how things\nhave got to change.\n\n191\n00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:42.751\nIt's at that point in time when what\nI expect you to do as an organization\n\n192\n00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:47.060\nis to maybe look at perhaps\nsome external consultancy.\n\n193\n00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.310\nOr maybe look at some white papers and\nlook what other people have done, and\n\n194\n00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.292\nwhat they have achieved, and\nwhat efficiencies they have achieved,\n\n195\n00:11:55.292 --> 00:11:56.927\nbefore you make a decision.\n\n196\n00:11:56.927 --> 00:12:01.521\nThe one thing that we do not want\nto do is bring in instability and\n\n197\n00:12:01.521 --> 00:12:04.207\nthere is a danger in testing things,\n\n198\n00:12:04.207 --> 00:12:09.340\nin putting your toe in the water and\nseeing whether this is a good idea.\n\n199\n00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:14.030\nMaybe we kind of want this structure,\nmaybe we don't.\n\n200\n00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.810\nWe need to be in a position\nwhere we're making decisions.\n\n201\n00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.270\nWe do not need to be in\na position where we're uncertain.\n\n202\n00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.750\nIf we're still uncertain,\n\n203\n00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.700\nthen now is not the time to make\nthat jump into the ecosystem.\n\n204\n00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.380\nYou've got to be fully aware of what\nit is that you're committing to.\n\n205\n00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.250\nWe have to have that commitment.\n\n206\n00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:36.680\nYou can't just kind of test it out and\nsee how it goes.\n\n207\n00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.300\nThis is not a test drive, it's not a call.\n&gt;&gt; Well, that is a good thing to know.\n\n208\n00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:45.240\nSo I'm guessing if terminologies like that\ncomes up during your planning phase, we've\n\n209\n00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.610\ntalked about in our road map, if someone\nwas like, well let's test this out.\n\n210\n00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:54.730\nThen you should probably reevaluate\nthe emphasis of why you're doing this and\n\n211\n00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:59.200\nthe plan to implement this migration,\nif you will.\n\n212\n00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.640\nIs that a correct or\n\n213\n00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.600\nan appropriate assertion at this point?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n214\n00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.390\nthere's nothing wrong with hypothesizing.\n\n215\n00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:09.250\nThere is nothing wrong with\nlooking at the alternatives.\n\n216\n00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.000\nIn fact, that should be part of,\nas you said, the planning.\n\n217\n00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.680\nWhen it comes to the implementation,\nit should be part of the planning phase.\n\n218\n00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.950\nBut as part of that planning phase and\nmaybe even before that, before we've even\n\n219\n00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:23.580\ngot to the business case, we need to be\nlooking at our alternative solutions.\n\n220\n00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.160\nGo back to the business case, and\n\n221\n00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.110\nin our business case, it's a justification\nfor an item of expenditure.\n\n222\n00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:35.870\nAnd in that business case we need\nto outline what our options are and\n\n223\n00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.700\nwhat the alternatives are, and\nwhat our recommendations would be.\n\n224\n00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.040\nSo even at that high level,\nright at the very,\n\n225\n00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.630\nvery beginning we need to be\naware of what our options are.\n\n226\n00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.820\nAnd we need to have been at a point where\nwe're making a decision because people\n\n227\n00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.430\nhave got to commit to this.\n\n228\n00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.960\nAnd I mean commit financially.\n\n229\n00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.600\nIf we're going to the customer\norganization and we're asking them for\n\n230\n00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.280\nmoney, then we're asking them for\na certain amount of money.\n\n231\n00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.935\nThis service integrator role\nis not going to be cheap.\n\n232\n00:14:04.935 --> 00:14:09.140\nAnd the difference between having\nan internal service integrator and\n\n233\n00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.110\nhaving an external service integrator,\nor the hybrid structure, or\n\n234\n00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:16.890\neven the lead supplier, which we're\ngoing to talk about in our next episode.\n\n235\n00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:21.550\nThose differences, there's gonna be a cost\ndifference between all of those as well,\n\n236\n00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.380\nbut you're gonna have different\nadvantages and disadvantages.\n\n237\n00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:29.170\nAnd so\nthe one thing that you shouldn't be doing,\n\n238\n00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:33.290\nis you shouldn't be at a point now\nwhere you're making that decision.\n\n239\n00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:37.960\nThat decision should have been made a long\ntime ago based on return on investment,\n\n240\n00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.470\nvalue on investment, etc, and\nwhat benefits you actually want to see.\n\n241\n00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.120\nSo this is not something that\nwe can think of as transitional.\n\n242\n00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.910\nWe definitely should be picking\nit up earlier on in the evolution\n\n243\n00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:54.130\nto the SIAM ecosystem.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\n\n244\n00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.310\nthat makes a lot of sense to me.\n\n245\n00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.440\nBut real quick question about the cost,\nand\n\n246\n00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.284\nmaybe you can give us\nsome general guidelines.\n\n247\n00:15:00.284 --> 00:15:04.280\nNot necessarily hard and\nfast rules, hard and\n\n248\n00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:09.288\nfast rules are sometimes a little\nbit of an over-commitment.\n\n249\n00:15:09.288 --> 00:15:14.370\nIn general, what the costs we\nsee as we progress through these\n\n250\n00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:19.160\ndifferent types of service integrators,\nexternal, hybrid and then internal,\n\n251\n00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:25.420\nwould that be an increase in\ncost as a total or are there too\n\n252\n00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.860\nmany factors to really take in play here?\n&gt;&gt; There's way too many factors.\n\n253\n00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.740\nI'll be perfectly honest with you,\nwe're talking total cost of ownership or\n\n254\n00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.950\nTCO we like acronyms yeah we are in IT.\n\n255\n00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:40.270\nIf we take a look at TCO for instance,\nthe cost of an internal service\n\n256\n00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:45.590\nprovider is not going to be\nas heavy on this front end.\n\n257\n00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.127\nThe initial investment for\n\n258\n00:15:47.127 --> 00:15:50.478\nan internal service integrator\nis not going to be as heavy.\n\n259\n00:15:50.478 --> 00:15:54.476\nWe may already have people in place,\nbut if we don't have people in place,\n\n260\n00:15:54.476 --> 00:15:58.727\nthen that cost is going to be fairly heavy\nbecause again we've got to think about\n\n261\n00:15:58.727 --> 00:15:59.691\nbenefits, etc.\n\n262\n00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:03.025\nAnd we may also have to\nthink about training,\n\n263\n00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:06.110\nThese people on our customs and our ways.\n\n264\n00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:12.660\nBut then, with that internal service\nintegrator, then we're gonna have to\n\n265\n00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:18.320\ninvest in training on an ongoing basis\nto keep their skills up to date.\n\n266\n00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.980\nSo there's going to be more cost\n\n267\n00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.490\nfrom a long term perspective with\nthe internal service integrator.\n\n268\n00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.080\nWith an external service integrator, sure,\n\n269\n00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.660\nwe've got an upfront cost because we're\ngoing to have to agree a contract.\n\n270\n00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:37.580\nBut usually, the contracts are,\nwell, they're negotiated,\n\n271\n00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.040\nbut then we pay on an interim basis.\n\n272\n00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.900\nWe don't necessarily pay\neverything up front.\n\n273\n00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.790\nAnd you see, we do not then take,\n\n274\n00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:49.160\nthe customer does not then take the\nresponsibility for all of the training and\n\n275\n00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.540\nthe skills, and\nany resilience options as well.\n\n276\n00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:57.360\nIf my full time employees are sick,\nand let's be honest with this,\n\n277\n00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.980\nI have to pay sick pay, and\nthen I also have to pay, potentially,\n\n278\n00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.430\nsomebody else to come in and\ndo their work.\n\n279\n00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.800\nSo I'm gonna suffer\nfinancial loss from that.\n\n280\n00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.310\nWhereas if a contractor is off sick,\n\n281\n00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:15.150\nsomebody who's not a full-time employee,\nthen I don't have to pay their salary.\n\n282\n00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:19.838\nAnd I don't have to pay sick pay,\nand that service integrator, then,\n\n283\n00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:25.440\nhas a responsibility to provide somebody\nto fill that role, to fill that gap.\n\n284\n00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.300\nSo the resilience option is there,\nand I'm not paying extra for\n\n285\n00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.160\nthat resilience option.\n\n286\n00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:36.910\nSo in terms of cost, the benefits and\nthe risks kind of outweigh each other.\n\n287\n00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.850\nThey shouldn't be too much\nof a difference in cost.\n\n288\n00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:44.610\nWe think that going external\nis going to cost us more\n\n289\n00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:49.770\nbecause you're paying maybe\na heavier hourly rate, but overall,\n\n290\n00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.785\nit might actually cost us less.\n&gt;&gt; Cost is always an iffy topic,\n\n291\n00:17:54.785 --> 00:17:56.888\nit's kind of why I brought it up.\n\n292\n00:17:56.888 --> 00:18:00.453\nBecause I'm trying to think,\nyou're balancing a great deal of\n\n293\n00:18:00.453 --> 00:18:04.550\nthese respective important\naspects of your business, right?\n\n294\n00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.310\nI want an internal, but\nis that gonna cost me more?\n\n295\n00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.920\nWell, it's cheaper upfront but long term,\n\n296\n00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.470\nit might cost me more\nthan doing an external.\n\n297\n00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:16.300\nDo I have the skills necessary to\nprovide the appropriate service\n\n298\n00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:21.240\nintegration to fully utilize that layer.\n\n299\n00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.630\nAnd then, well, I have a hybrid approach.\n\n300\n00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.680\nAnd you're right, Jo, this episode just\nmade me have a lot more questions than-\n\n301\n00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.207\n&gt;&gt; Well, we haven't finished yet.\n\n302\n00:18:29.207 --> 00:18:29.818\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n303\n00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:30.536\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n304\n00:18:30.536 --> 00:18:31.587\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right,\n\n305\n00:18:31.587 --> 00:18:36.353\nI was like, man, all these questions.\n&gt;&gt; We've just looked at one particular\n\n306\n00:18:36.353 --> 00:18:40.607\naspect, because then we've got\nanother aspect, which is less common.\n\n307\n00:18:40.607 --> 00:18:46.839\nBut that's the aspect where we use\nan external service integrator,\n\n308\n00:18:46.839 --> 00:18:51.470\nas it were, but\nwe actually have internal people.\n\n309\n00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:56.410\nThis is less common, by the way, but\nwe actually have internal people as part\n\n310\n00:18:56.410 --> 00:19:01.112\nof that external service integrator.\n&gt;&gt; Jo,\n\n311\n00:19:01.112 --> 00:19:03.618\nI'm not sure this is [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH].\n\n312\n00:19:03.618 --> 00:19:08.763\nSo effectively we would place employees\ninside of the external service integrator,\n\n313\n00:19:08.763 --> 00:19:11.940\nthey would belong,\nthey would be our employees?\n\n314\n00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.870\nBut they would act in the capacity of the\nexternal service integrator that would be\n\n315\n00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.105\nservicing our company, though, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n316\n00:19:20.105 --> 00:19:24.353\none of the reasons why we might do this,\nand this is where the hybrid comes in.\n\n317\n00:19:24.353 --> 00:19:29.167\nSo don't just think about, we're going\nto bring people into our organization,\n\n318\n00:19:29.167 --> 00:19:31.110\nwe might do it the other way.\n\n319\n00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:35.210\nThis is less common,I have to say,\nbut we might, it's an option.\n\n320\n00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:40.458\nAnd if we do that, we're doing that\nbecause, perhaps, we might perceive,\n\n321\n00:19:40.458 --> 00:19:45.247\ngonna bring human nature into this,\nand I've done it in all of these.\n\n322\n00:19:45.247 --> 00:19:49.915\nWe might perceive that maybe the external\nservice integrator is not necessarily\n\n323\n00:19:49.915 --> 00:19:54.870\ngonna be working in our best interests,\nbecause they've got other clients as well.\n\n324\n00:19:55.910 --> 00:20:01.342\nSo we might want to put our\nemployees into that, because they're\n\n325\n00:20:01.342 --> 00:20:05.958\ngoing to look after our best interests.\n&gt;&gt; And we're not talking about espionage\n\n326\n00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:07.917\nhere or anything like that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No.\n\n327\n00:20:07.917 --> 00:20:09.615\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about, well,\n\n328\n00:20:09.615 --> 00:20:14.057\nlet me place employees with you, that way\nthat we can utilize all of the expertise\n\n329\n00:20:14.057 --> 00:20:17.014\nand skills and\nthings that you have at your disposal.\n\n330\n00:20:17.014 --> 00:20:22.099\nBut we also have someone that has our\nvested best interests at hand internal\n\n331\n00:20:22.099 --> 00:20:25.310\nto this external service integrator.\n&gt;&gt; One of\n\n332\n00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.950\nthe reasons why I say that this is\nnot necessarily as popular is because\n\n333\n00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:32.770\nthe external service integrator\ndoesn't necessarily like that.\n\n334\n00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:36.917\nPurely because they perceive them,\nI'm not talking about espionage, but\n\n335\n00:20:36.917 --> 00:20:38.610\nthey perceive them as plants.\n\n336\n00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:43.697\nBut it also means that that person that\nbelongs to the customer may be privy\n\n337\n00:20:43.697 --> 00:20:49.840\nto other customer information, and they\nmay not necessarily want that to happen.\n\n338\n00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.840\nSo whilst it does happen,\nit's not necessarily as common.\n\n339\n00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:59.180\nBut it does provide us with\na benefit of skill sharing.\n\n340\n00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:04.180\nIt provides us as a customer with the\nbenefit of having somebody who is fully\n\n341\n00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.890\nup to date with all of the latest skills,\nbecause they're there.\n\n342\n00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.914\nAnd they're being absorbed\ninto that external\n\n343\n00:21:11.914 --> 00:21:15.940\norganization to a certain extent.\n&gt;&gt; I could definitely see where this\n\n344\n00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.694\nwould be an iffy thing,\nespecially in certain sectors, industries,\n\n345\n00:21:19.694 --> 00:21:22.710\nwe talked about data security and\nthings of that nature.\n\n346\n00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:27.553\nBut are there, I guess there are possible\nlegislation that would prevent this from\n\n347\n00:21:27.553 --> 00:21:31.705\nactually occurring because of business\nlaws, like financial data and\n\n348\n00:21:31.705 --> 00:21:35.540\nthings like that, right?\n&gt;&gt; Well, it works in both ways,\n\n349\n00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.910\nto be honest,\nbecause I have seen organizations.\n\n350\n00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:42.050\nAnd it depends on the country that\nyou're in, it depends on the state.\n\n351\n00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:46.990\nIn some countries around the world,\nyou are not allowed, employment laws\n\n352\n00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:51.350\nwill not allow you, to treat a contractor\nany differently to a full time employee.\n\n353\n00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:53.840\nSo they have to have access\nto exactly the same thing,\n\n354\n00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.950\nthey have to be subject to\nthe same sort of clearances, etc.\n\n355\n00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:01.160\nThey have to be able to do their work,\neven to the point of getting sick pay and\n\n356\n00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.155\nvacation or holiday pay as well.\n\n357\n00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:06.620\nThey have to be able to do their work\nto the same standards as a full-time\n\n358\n00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:07.160\nemployee.\n\n359\n00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.490\nBut then there are other places,\nand I've worked in some states,\n\n360\n00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.420\nwhere contractors are treated\ncompletely differently.\n\n361\n00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:20.540\nAnd they have access to a very\nlimited subset of the data and\n\n362\n00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.660\nthe applications that\na full time employee has.\n\n363\n00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:29.283\nAnd so we also have to consider\nthe legislation behind all of this.\n\n364\n00:22:29.283 --> 00:22:36.780\nBecause sometimes laws will override\nethics within an organization.\n\n365\n00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.540\nAnd so that has to be a consideration\n\n366\n00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:43.580\nwhen you make your decision as to\nwhat type of structure you want.\n\n367\n00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.270\nAnd if you do want that hybrid\nservice integrator structure,\n\n368\n00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:48.570\nthen which do you want?\n\n369\n00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:52.143\nDo you want to have your people offsite,\nor\n\n370\n00:22:52.143 --> 00:22:56.629\ndo you want to have contract\nexternal people on site?\n\n371\n00:22:56.629 --> 00:22:57.524\nAnd if you do,\n\n372\n00:22:57.524 --> 00:23:02.430\nwhat's gonna happen with things like\ndata protection, who owns the data?\n\n373\n00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.600\nIf the data is on your tools,\nand by the way,\n\n374\n00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.940\nthis is something that we\nhave to consider anyway.\n\n375\n00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:11.170\nBut if the data is on your tools, then\nthat's your data, but if the data is there\n\n376\n00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:15.590\non their call logging system, whose\ndata is it, is it yours or is it theirs?\n\n377\n00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.081\nAnd if it's yours,\n\n378\n00:23:17.081 --> 00:23:22.091\nthen how do you extract that from\nof all their other clients as well?\n\n379\n00:23:22.091 --> 00:23:26.843\nThere are lots of factors and, of course,\nwe've got other classes that go into these\n\n380\n00:23:26.843 --> 00:23:31.290\nin a lot more depth and look at the\npossibilities and look at what we can do.\n\n381\n00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:35.120\nBut there are lots of factors that\ncome into making that decision.\n\n382\n00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.270\nThis is not just as simple as, well,\nwe'll bring in a few contractors and\n\n383\n00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:44.292\nthen they'll be able to do their job.\n&gt;&gt; And I can see that, but\n\n384\n00:23:44.292 --> 00:23:50.575\nit brings up another question for me,\nI know, Jo, I'm full of questions.\n\n385\n00:23:50.575 --> 00:23:55.690\nGiven that these respective arrangements,\nwe've been talking about hybrid.\n\n386\n00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:59.293\nAnd the two variants of hybrid where\nwe have external coming internal,\n\n387\n00:23:59.293 --> 00:24:02.548\nor internal employees going to\nan external one and kinda [SOUND].\n\n388\n00:24:02.548 --> 00:24:04.956\nMarrying those two things together.\n\n389\n00:24:04.956 --> 00:24:10.216\nDo any of these particular arrangements\nbecause of possible changes\n\n390\n00:24:10.216 --> 00:24:15.293\nof legislation or rules or regulations,\nare any of them riskier in\n\n391\n00:24:15.293 --> 00:24:20.839\nthe terms of now I'm forced to make\na change by regulation changes?\n\n392\n00:24:20.839 --> 00:24:26.377\nThe hybrid structure, that seems like that\nmight be a whoops, there's a new law and\n\n393\n00:24:26.377 --> 00:24:31.560\nnow we can't have our employees internal\nto an external because of data laws.\n\n394\n00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.456\nOr you have access to other\nfinancial records or something.\n\n395\n00:24:33.456 --> 00:24:34.319\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean,\n\n396\n00:24:34.319 --> 00:24:38.160\nthere are different laws around the world,\ncompletely different laws.\n\n397\n00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.886\nThey are obviously, for\nthose of you who don't know, Justin and\n\n398\n00:24:41.886 --> 00:24:46.923\nI don't come from the same place, oddly\nenough, yeah, slightly different accents.\n\n399\n00:24:46.923 --> 00:24:47.715\n&gt;&gt; Little bit.\n\n400\n00:24:47.715 --> 00:24:48.375\n&gt;&gt; Just a tiny little bit.\n\n401\n00:24:48.375 --> 00:24:49.312\n&gt;&gt; Little bit.\n\n402\n00:24:49.312 --> 00:24:50.318\n&gt;&gt; Which means [LAUGH]-\n\n403\n00:24:50.318 --> 00:24:51.245\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n404\n00:24:51.245 --> 00:24:53.388\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Which means that we have got,\n\n405\n00:24:53.388 --> 00:24:57.965\nto some extent, completely different\nlaws that potentially govern sort of\n\n406\n00:24:57.965 --> 00:25:01.862\nthe way that we have worked\nin the past most definitely.\n\n407\n00:25:01.862 --> 00:25:06.160\nAnd so and\nit's true to say that in Europe,\n\n408\n00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.610\nthere are very, very strong,\n\n409\n00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:15.940\nvery stringent employment laws in Europe\nthat definitely favor the employee.\n\n410\n00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:20.740\nAnd so in Europe, you are not able\nto treat a contractor as anybody\n\n411\n00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:24.250\ndifferent and\nyou have to give them holiday pay.\n\n412\n00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.840\nIf they're with you for a certain length\nof time, you have to give them holiday\n\n413\n00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.810\npay, you have to give them sick pay,\nyou have to give them certain perks.\n\n414\n00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.480\nYou don't have to give them perks, like\nyou don't have to give them a company car,\n\n415\n00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.990\nor you don't have to give them\nprivate health insurance.\n\n416\n00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:38.740\nBut then here in the States,\n\n417\n00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:43.130\nit really depends on the state by\nstate basis as to what those laws are.\n\n418\n00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:46.930\nNow, the company, if it's a global\ncompany, may turn around and say,\n\n419\n00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:47.822\nright, okay.\n\n420\n00:25:47.822 --> 00:25:50.685\nSo overall,\nwhenever we bring in contractors,\n\n421\n00:25:50.685 --> 00:25:54.920\nwe are going to decide that we're\ngonna pay them say vacation pay.\n\n422\n00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.810\nWe're gonna give them vacation pay,\n\n423\n00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:02.074\njust because it's part of our\ncompany ethic to do that.\n\n424\n00:26:02.074 --> 00:26:07.560\nAnd then maybe the state then issues a law\nthat says, right, okay, if you're contract\n\n425\n00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:12.440\nstaff, you're entitled to x amount of\npercentage from your employer every\n\n426\n00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:17.550\nmonth over and above full time staff,\nbut you're not entitled to vacation pay.\n\n427\n00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:24.010\nIn which case, then that could\nchange completely the dynamic.\n\n428\n00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:25.760\nIf there are any changes in the laws,\n\n429\n00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.210\nit could change the dynamic\nof the service integrator.\n\n430\n00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:34.270\nAnd it could also change\nthe way that we treat,\n\n431\n00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.990\nwithin the organization,\nour contractors across the board.\n\n432\n00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:39.853\nIt's much more efficient for\n\n433\n00:26:39.853 --> 00:26:43.291\nan organization to treat\neverybody exactly the same.\n\n434\n00:26:43.291 --> 00:26:44.429\nBut at the same time,\n\n435\n00:26:44.429 --> 00:26:48.020\nwe have to acknowledge that\nsometimes that's not possible.\n\n436\n00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:54.370\nAnd so laws can come over and\noverride what we have agreed.\n\n437\n00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:58.353\nAnd so we have to have the flexibility\nin our contracts to ensure that,\n\n438\n00:26:58.353 --> 00:27:02.808\nwe have to have a clause in there that\nsays that if something in the law changes,\n\n439\n00:27:02.808 --> 00:27:05.195\nthen we're going to have to change this.\n\n440\n00:27:05.195 --> 00:27:10.058\nBecause what we don't want is in\nthis particular environment, and\n\n441\n00:27:10.058 --> 00:27:14.924\nespecially when we're looking\nat external service integrators,\n\n442\n00:27:14.924 --> 00:27:20.553\nwe do not want to expose ourselves as an\norganization to any sort of espionage or\n\n443\n00:27:20.553 --> 00:27:22.732\nany data protection issues.\n\n444\n00:27:22.732 --> 00:27:26.260\nWe also wanna ensure\nthe integrity of our data.\n\n445\n00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.407\nAnd we don't wanna lose our\ndata to our competitors.\n\n446\n00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:35.280\nBut our external service integrators, even\nif they're internal to our organization\n\n447\n00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:40.130\nand they sat with us, they don't want\nto lose any of their data either.\n\n448\n00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:44.960\nThey want to ensure that they can\nmaintain integrity of their data, and\n\n449\n00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.830\nthey have corporate policies that\nthey want to uphold as well.\n\n450\n00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.419\nSo we have to be respectful of that.\n\n451\n00:27:51.419 --> 00:27:55.339\nAnd the hybrid structure can be,\nin some respects,\n\n452\n00:27:55.339 --> 00:28:01.140\nit looks easier to manage because it\nlooks like a much simpler solution.\n\n453\n00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:04.960\nBut in other respects, it actually can\nbe a bit of a nightmare to manage,\n\n454\n00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:09.224\nespecially when we've got people that\nare on the same site that essentially have\n\n455\n00:28:09.224 --> 00:28:12.360\ndifferent terms and conditions.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\n\n456\n00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:17.462\nas I said before I always\nsomehow put my foot in my mouth.\n\n457\n00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:19.768\nI think this is gonna align\nmore with my thought process.\n\n458\n00:28:19.768 --> 00:28:21.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n459\n00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.610\n&gt;&gt; And I didn't even think about taking\n\n460\n00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:27.240\ninternal employees and putting them in an\nexternal site in order to make sure that I\n\n461\n00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:31.880\nhave kind of my interest represented\nwithin those respective things.\n\n462\n00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.897\nThat wasn't a thought that I even\nhad as a possible hybrid approach.\n\n463\n00:28:34.897 --> 00:28:35.522\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n464\n00:28:35.522 --> 00:28:38.647\nthere's one more thing that\nwe've got to bear in mind, and\n\n465\n00:28:38.647 --> 00:28:41.770\nI mentioned human nature before as well.\n\n466\n00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:45.570\nAnd it's really, really easy for\n\n467\n00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:49.710\na contractor to forget\nthat they're a contractor.\n\n468\n00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:54.035\nAnd it's really easy to forget if you are\nworking in an environment the whole time,\n\n469\n00:28:54.035 --> 00:28:56.900\nyou very quickly become part of the team.\n\n470\n00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.230\nAnd it's really, really easy for\n\n471\n00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:02.620\nyou to forget that you're not\nactually part of that team.\n\n472\n00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:06.030\nSo in that hybrid structure,\nthat is a danger.\n\n473\n00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.780\nAnd so you've gotta be very aware of that.\n\n474\n00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.700\nAnd it's very easy for management to\nforget that that person that's working\n\n475\n00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.490\nwith you is not necessarily\npart of your team either.\n\n476\n00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:18.848\nAnd therefore you've gotta be careful what\nsort of things you say to them or you've\n\n477\n00:29:18.848 --> 00:29:22.250\ngotta be wary of the fact that they don't\nhave access to everything that you do, so\n\n478\n00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:24.420\nthey might not be as efficient as you are.\n\n479\n00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:28.030\nSo that's something that we just\ngot to bear in mind as well.\n\n480\n00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:28.580\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jo,\n\n481\n00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:32.330\nthis is always, always a pleasure\nto have these discussions.\n\n482\n00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:37.510\nNow, I think we have a pretty\ngood kind of overview of hybrid.\n\n483\n00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:40.950\nI might be stepping the line there.\n\n484\n00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:44.050\nI said that, and\nimmediately went, probably not.\n\n485\n00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:45.475\nBut that's okay, but\n\n486\n00:29:45.475 --> 00:29:47.839\nwhere are we going from here?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n487\n00:29:47.839 --> 00:29:52.631\nwhere are we're going from here is in our\nnext episode we're going to be looking at\n\n488\n00:29:52.631 --> 00:29:55.300\nthe lead supplier service integrator.\n\n489\n00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:59.413\nSo that's gonna be something that's\ncompletely different for you.\n\n490\n00:29:59.413 --> 00:30:02.710\nAnd I look forward to seeing\nyou in that next episode.\n\n491\n00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:04.750\n&gt;&gt; Well, I look forward to, well,\n\n492\n00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:09.460\nseeing what a lead supplier is because I\nthought we'd covered all of our bases.\n\n493\n00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.060\nAnd then Jo just pulls\nsomething out of the air.\n\n494\n00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:14.120\nAnd says, no,\nyou gotta learn about these as well.\n\n495\n00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.343\nSo definitely join us on back so\n\n496\n00:30:15.343 --> 00:30:17.370\nwe can figure out what\na lead supplier is together.\n\n497\n00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.580\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n498\n00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:22.540\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n499\n00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:23.441\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n500\n00:30:23.441 --> 00:30:25.537\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n501\n00:30:25.537 -->

00:00:07.814\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.814 --> 00:00:12.966\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.722\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:21.350\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and we're\ncontinuing on with our integrators, right?\n\n7\n00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.520\nAnd we're gonna be talking about\nlead suppliers in this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.010\nAnd I put an s on that, and I feel like\nit's maybe a single lead supplier.\n\n9\n00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.655\nBut here to make sure we add s or\ndo not add s is the one and only Ms.\n\n10\n00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:38.610\nJo Peacock, how you doing today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; I'm absolutely fine, thank you Justin,\n\n11\n00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.907\nand I do think that we need to\nexplain to everybody that's watching.\n\n12\n00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:45.427\nThat if you haven't seen any of the\nprevious episodes, there is a reason for\n\n13\n00:00:45.427 --> 00:00:46.143\nthat comment.\n\n14\n00:00:46.143 --> 00:00:50.393\nBecause Justin has an awful habit\nof referring to this as our SIAM\n\n15\n00:00:50.393 --> 00:00:54.410\nfoundations show,\nrather than our SIAM foundation show.\n\n16\n00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.559\nAnd that's the reason why we have\na bit of a laugh about our s.\n\n17\n00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.284\nHe just has too many, way too many.\n&gt;&gt; It is and for\n\n18\n00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:05.581\nsome reason, s's just roll of my tongue.\n\n19\n00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:09.535\nOr maybe I have some weird infatuation\nwith snakes and it's the hissing sound,\n\n20\n00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:12.338\nwho knows, but.\n&gt;&gt; I thought it was just American spelling\n\n21\n00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:15.822\nor something, that's what it was.\n&gt;&gt; Could be that, could be that,\n\n22\n00:01:15.822 --> 00:01:17.289\nwho knows, though, Jo.\n\n23\n00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.586\nBut we are gonna be talking about\nlead supplier, or lead suppliers,\n\n24\n00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:23.820\nI'm a little confused about that.\n\n25\n00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.490\nBut luckily, I think, Jo, you're gonna\ngive us a great overview, right?\n\n26\n00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.233\n&gt;&gt; Right, we're talking about,\n\n27\n00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:32.144\nwe're in SIAM,\nwe're in our SIAM foundation show.\n\n28\n00:01:32.144 --> 00:01:37.226\nAnd what we're talking about are service\nintegrators, plural, service integrators.\n\n29\n00:01:37.226 --> 00:01:42.589\nAnd one of those types of service\nintegrator is the lead supplier,\n\n30\n00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:46.300\njust in the singular, just the one, yep.\n\n31\n00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.360\nWe're gonna be looking at, well,\ndo you remember what we've looked at so\n\n32\n00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.742\nfar in our previous episodes?\n&gt;&gt; So in our previous episodes,\n\n33\n00:01:51.742 --> 00:01:53.873\nwe've talked about internal\nservice integrators,\n\n34\n00:01:53.873 --> 00:01:56.015\nwe've talked about external\nservice integrators.\n\n35\n00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:59.800\nAnd then we talked about a hybrid approach\nthat wasn't quite as simple as I initially\n\n36\n00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.526\nthought.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n37\n00:02:00.526 --> 00:02:02.677\n&gt;&gt; We had an external that was brought\n\n38\n00:02:02.677 --> 00:02:06.470\ninternal, either a contract basis or\nsomething like that.\n\n39\n00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.080\nBut we also had the ability\nto create a hybrid approach\n\n40\n00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.020\nby taking internal employees and placing\nthem in our external service integrator.\n\n41\n00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.860\nSo we make sure we have\nour vested interests.\n\n42\n00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.598\nDid I rather cover that well, or?\n&gt;&gt; Kind of,\n\n43\n00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:22.972\nI just want to add some clarity to that,\nbecause the external that we\n\n44\n00:02:22.972 --> 00:02:25.710\nbring internal is still part\nof that hybrid approach.\n\n45\n00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.110\nThe hybrid approach is a mixture of the\ntwo, whether it's external that we bring\n\n46\n00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.880\ninternal, or whether it's internal\nthat we kind of push out external.\n\n47\n00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.100\nThen yeah,\nboth of those are a hybrid approach.\n\n48\n00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.636\nSo yeah, you did all right, I'm impressed.\n&gt;&gt; It's like I'm\n\n49\n00:02:41.636 --> 00:02:46.185\nlearning something, Jo, I'm kinda scared.\n&gt;&gt; Trust me, I am too.\n\n50\n00:02:46.185 --> 00:02:47.346\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n51\n00:02:47.346 --> 00:02:48.691\n&gt;&gt; I'm incredibly scared, well,\n\n52\n00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:49.651\nlet's wrap up, then,\n\n53\n00:02:49.651 --> 00:02:52.375\nthis particular little miniseries\nthat we've got going on here.\n\n54\n00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:56.956\nBecause we're gonna look at our\nfourth service [SOUND] see now,\n\n55\n00:02:56.956 --> 00:03:01.026\nyou're having an effect on me Justin,\nyou really are.\n\n56\n00:03:01.026 --> 00:03:05.560\nNow I can't articulate anymore,\nit's a service integrator.\n\n57\n00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.827\nWe're looking at our first,\nfourth, I'm still doing it,\n\n58\n00:03:08.827 --> 00:03:10.888\nour fourth service integrator type.\n\n59\n00:03:10.888 --> 00:03:16.040\nAnd our fourth service integrator\ntype is the lead supplier.\n\n60\n00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.330\nNow, in this particular episode, what\nwe're going to do is, we're just gonna\n\n61\n00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.470\nanalyze really what a lead supplier is and\nwhat do we actually mean by that.\n\n62\n00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.690\nAnd it's actually a really,\nreally simple concept.\n\n63\n00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.221\nSometimes I will tell you\nthat instead of the, or well,\n\n64\n00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:38.853\nas an addition to the internal\nservice integrator.\n\n65\n00:03:38.853 --> 00:03:43.530\nThis one is possibly the next best\noption for organizations that\n\n66\n00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.910\nare a little bit wary about moving to\na full external service integrator.\n\n67\n00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.698\nThey're a little bit scared,\na little bit reluctant,\n\n68\n00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:53.967\nto move to the external\nservice integrator.\n\n69\n00:03:53.967 --> 00:04:00.263\nSo this is kind of a stepping stone in\nbetween the internal and the external.\n\n70\n00:04:00.263 --> 00:04:02.790\nNow, I know that in a previous episode,\n\n71\n00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.470\nJustin thought that maybe the hybrid\nwas kind of a mash up between the two,\n\n72\n00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.550\nbetween the internal and\nexternal, and it sort of is.\n\n73\n00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.840\nBut this actually, the lead\nsupplier lends a degree of comfort\n\n74\n00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.560\nto a lot of organizations that\nare moving to a SIAM based ecosystem.\n\n75\n00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.350\nCuz in the lead supplier service\nintegrator, what we'll do is,\n\n76\n00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.500\nwe take generally one of\nour existing suppliers, and\n\n77\n00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.610\nsomebody that we've got\na relationship with.\n\n78\n00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.080\nAnd then we give them the role\nof the service integrator.\n\n79\n00:04:39.415 --> 00:04:44.368\nSo unlike the internal service integrator,\nwhere we are using\n\n80\n00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:48.970\nan internal team, maybe our current\ninternal service provider, and\n\n81\n00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.670\nwe're using them to manage\nall of those providers.\n\n82\n00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.126\nAnd then we've got the external\nteam where we are going outside, so\n\n83\n00:04:57.126 --> 00:04:59.533\nwe're going to a separate company.\n\n84\n00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:03.415\nA company that will specialize\nin service integration, and\n\n85\n00:05:03.415 --> 00:05:08.057\nwe'll go outside and we'll ask them\nto be a service integrator for us and\n\n86\n00:05:08.057 --> 00:05:11.630\nmanage all of the complexity\nof the contracts.\n\n87\n00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.218\nHere what we're doing is, we're\nactually saying, well, you know what,\n\n88\n00:05:15.218 --> 00:05:17.303\nwe've got a supplier that we really trust.\n\n89\n00:05:17.303 --> 00:05:21.981\nThat we've got a really good relationship\nwith, that we get along really,\n\n90\n00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:23.160\nreally well with.\n\n91\n00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.970\nAnd we're going to ask them to fulfill\nthe roles of the service integrator.\n\n92\n00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.980\nSo rather than go out and find somebody\nnew, we're gonna ask them to do that.\n\n93\n00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.473\nAnd they're still a supplier,\n\n94\n00:05:37.473 --> 00:05:43.389\nthey are still providing us with\nan element, or a component, of a service.\n\n95\n00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.667\nSo they're still a service provider, but\n\n96\n00:05:45.667 --> 00:05:50.159\nthey're also doing all of the management\nand all of the coordination, etc, that is\n\n97\n00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:54.425\ninvolved with the service integrator\nlayer and that service integrator role.\n\n98\n00:05:54.425 --> 00:05:58.735\nSo what happens is that\ntheir role is expanded.\n\n99\n00:05:58.735 --> 00:06:03.625\nAnd their role is not just\nas a service provider, but\n\n100\n00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:07.395\ntheir role is also to manage all\nof the other service providers.\n\n101\n00:06:07.395 --> 00:06:10.195\nAnd if we take a look at the screen\nin front of us right now,\n\n102\n00:06:10.195 --> 00:06:14.185\nyou'll see that we've got many, many\nservice providers, including internal and\n\n103\n00:06:14.185 --> 00:06:16.045\nexternal service providers.\n\n104\n00:06:16.045 --> 00:06:22.010\nBut that service integrator\nis also a service provider.\n\n105\n00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.952\nCan you see any issues with that?\n&gt;&gt; It seems like if we had services that\n\n106\n00:06:27.952 --> 00:06:32.210\nhad overlap, then there may be\nsome biases that can crop up.\n\n107\n00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.000\nWhen a respective external service\nprovider is, I don't know,\n\n108\n00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.820\npromoted to the service integrator.\n\n109\n00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.230\nSo this seems like one of those human\nfactor things where you're picking\n\n110\n00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.250\nan external service provider that you\nhave a preexisting relationship with.\n\n111\n00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:52.714\nAnd then you're making them more,\nI hesitate to say a decision maker,\n\n112\n00:06:52.714 --> 00:06:57.631\nbut they become a little bit of\na decision maker, that could have\n\n113\n00:06:57.631 --> 00:07:01.147\nsome conflict of interest, I suppose.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n114\n00:07:01.147 --> 00:07:04.960\nyou mentioned conflict of interest, and\nthat was that I was trying to get to.\n\n115\n00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.550\nIt's not so\nmuch as making them a decision maker,\n\n116\n00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.230\nbecause the decision maker\nis still the customer.\n\n117\n00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:14.239\nThe customer organization\nmanages all the contracts, so\n\n118\n00:07:14.239 --> 00:07:18.340\nthey are the decision maker,\nnot the service integrator.\n\n119\n00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.740\nHowever, it could be a conflict of\ninterest, and you mentioned another word,\n\n120\n00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.650\nyou mentioned the word bias, and\nthat's an important one as well.\n\n121\n00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.725\nIt would be very, very easy for the lead\nsupplier, let's just say, if they were\n\n122\n00:07:31.725 --> 00:07:37.010\nbeing unethical, it would be very easy for\nthat lead supplier to then act\n\n123\n00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.360\nin a partial manner,\nrather than an impartial manner.\n\n124\n00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.110\nSo if that particular supplier is\nnot performing against their service\n\n125\n00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.750\nlevel targets, and we've discussed those\nin great lengths in our previous episodes.\n\n126\n00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.964\nIf they're not performing against\nthe service level targets, then it's very,\n\n127\n00:07:57.964 --> 00:08:00.780\nvery, easy for\nthat to be overlooked, perhaps.\n\n128\n00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:06.422\nOr it's very easy for penalties and\nincentives to not necessarily be enforced.\n\n129\n00:08:06.422 --> 00:08:11.284\nIt's also very easy for any of the other\nexternal service providers to then\n\n130\n00:08:11.284 --> 00:08:15.610\nmaybe take exception, and\nto question that relationship.\n\n131\n00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.950\nBecause they may feel as though\nthey're being extensively penalized.\n\n132\n00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:25.410\nOr maybe there isn't the amount of,\nI was gonna say accommodation,\n\n133\n00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:30.610\nbut there isn't that amount of\nunderstanding that's involved between\n\n134\n00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.580\nthat service integrator and\nthe other external service providers.\n\n135\n00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.324\nAnd we've also gotta think that because\nour external integrator is another service\n\n136\n00:08:40.324 --> 00:08:43.743\nprovider, and they are not\nan impartial service provider.\n\n137\n00:08:43.743 --> 00:08:47.800\nThen that could result in\nissues with sharing of data or\n\n138\n00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:53.280\nsharing of records, such as incident\nrecords, problem records, etc.\n\n139\n00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.390\nBecause there may be\na reluctance to do so.\n\n140\n00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:00.120\nSo whilst from the customer perspective,\n\n141\n00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:05.620\nthat is seen as something that\nwill give them a feel good factor.\n\n142\n00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:09.290\nAnd as much as we're using somebody\nthat we're comfortable with and\n\n143\n00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.703\nsomebody that we potentially already know.\n\n144\n00:09:11.703 --> 00:09:16.497\nThe fact of the matter is, from the other\nexternal service providers' perspectives,\n\n145\n00:09:16.497 --> 00:09:19.477\nthen it might not necessarily\nbe a good relationship or\n\n146\n00:09:19.477 --> 00:09:23.191\na good thing.\n&gt;&gt; It seems like we're talking a little\n\n147\n00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:27.188\nbit about, and we're not saying\nthis happens always, all the time,\n\n148\n00:09:27.188 --> 00:09:28.085\nin actuality.\n\n149\n00:09:28.085 --> 00:09:31.569\nThis is more of a thought experiment\nof what could happen, and\n\n150\n00:09:31.569 --> 00:09:34.050\nwe're talking about shaping perception.\n\n151\n00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:39.621\nThey're inadvertently granted a little\nbit of power that could shape\n\n152\n00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:43.885\nthe perception of the customer,\nversus the other external providers.\n\n153\n00:09:43.885 --> 00:09:50.580\nAnd I can see where, well, they didn't\nfulfill their part of the contract.\n\n154\n00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:56.540\nBut we have a service we can also\nsell you that would replace theirs,\n\n155\n00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.920\nand we would be able to fulfill that,\n\n156\n00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.980\nbecause you know us, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n157\n00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.650\nit's a real difficult\nrelationship to manage.\n\n158\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:07.890\nAnd it's funny, because when I said right\nat the very beginning that this is one\n\n159\n00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:11.400\nthat most customers will\nfeel fairly comfortable with\n\n160\n00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.635\nbecause it's a supplier that they trust.\n\n161\n00:10:14.635 --> 00:10:17.808\nNevertheless, that they might\ntrust that supplier, but\n\n162\n00:10:17.808 --> 00:10:20.667\nthen that in itself can\ncause all sorts of problems.\n\n163\n00:10:20.667 --> 00:10:25.390\nBecause all it takes is for\none supplier to fail in a certain way.\n\n164\n00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:29.820\nAnd that potential lead supplier\ncould offer to pick up the pieces.\n\n165\n00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.690\nSo what you want to do,\nif you do want to use\n\n166\n00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:37.543\na lead supplier in this particular role,\nas the service integrator.\n\n167\n00:10:37.543 --> 00:10:41.778\nThen you should try to ensure\nthat that lead supplier is\n\n168\n00:10:41.778 --> 00:10:46.752\nsomebody that is not performing or\nnot capable of performing any\n\n169\n00:10:46.752 --> 00:10:51.100\nof the roles of any of\nthe other service providers.\n\n170\n00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.810\nIf you're gonna use a lead supplier that\nis perfectly capable of performing all of\n\n171\n00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.260\nthe roles of all of\nthe other service providers,\n\n172\n00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.600\nthen there could be\na conflict of interest.\n\n173\n00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:04.000\nSo it's important that your\nlead supplier is not able to\n\n174\n00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.440\nstep into the shoes of any of\nthe other service providers.\n\n175\n00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.300\nThen that way, there can't be\nthat conflict of interest that\n\n176\n00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.663\nyou mentioned there.\n&gt;&gt; And this seems like something that if\n\n177\n00:11:13.663 --> 00:11:18.433\nwe're not careful when we make our\ndecisions, in some previous episodes,\n\n178\n00:11:18.433 --> 00:11:23.900\nwe looked at that progression from step\none, step two, step three, that evolution.\n\n179\n00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.660\nThe idea is, we're at step three,\nwhere we have these multiple sources and\n\n180\n00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.360\nthese providers, well,\nnow we're back to consolidating.\n\n181\n00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.260\nIf they shape our perception,\nwe're moving back through the progression,\n\n182\n00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.720\nwhich could in turn lead\nto some difficulties for\n\n183\n00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.593\nthe customer organization, correct?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, definitely so, so we have to\n\n184\n00:11:42.593 --> 00:11:48.390\nensure that that service provider,\nthat lead supplier, acts impartially.\n\n185\n00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:53.080\nWe have to ensure that they're acting in\nthe best interests of the customer, and\n\n186\n00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.400\nnot in their own best interest.\n\n187\n00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.280\nAnd that one is gonna be a challenge,\nand I'm not gonna pretend that it's not.\n\n188\n00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.129\nIt's not very easy to\nremain that impartial.\n\n189\n00:12:04.129 --> 00:12:09.331\nWhich is why, as I said, the best\nthing that we can advise would be for\n\n190\n00:12:09.331 --> 00:12:13.731\nthat service provider,\nthat supplier, to be completely\n\n191\n00:12:13.731 --> 00:12:19.060\nindependent of the skills of any\nof the other service providers.\n\n192\n00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:24.566\nIt's even been seen in the real world,\nin this SIAM ecosystem.\n\n193\n00:12:24.566 --> 00:12:31.695\nWhere this leader supplier can rival the\nskills of the internal service providers.\n\n194\n00:12:31.695 --> 00:12:35.640\nAnd in which case then, again, we have\nthat conflict of interest going on.\n\n195\n00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.090\nAnd that could cause tension as well,\n\n196\n00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:41.150\nit's not just about the conflict\nof interest, it can cause tension.\n\n197\n00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:43.420\nWhat we're really aiming for,\nwe're aiming for collaboration.\n\n198\n00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:49.920\nWe're aiming for a cohesive service\nto be delivered to the customer.\n\n199\n00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.620\nYou mentioned the word perception,\nthe word perceived.\n\n200\n00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:58.440\nWe want to deliver value to the customer\nand the customer perceives value.\n\n201\n00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.530\nValue is one of the,\nit's very subjective, and\n\n202\n00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:06.670\nit's one of those elements\nwhere you will perceive value.\n\n203\n00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.621\nAnd we can influence that perception,\nmost definitely, and\n\n204\n00:13:09.621 --> 00:13:12.018\nwe explored this in one\nof our previous episodes.\n\n205\n00:13:12.018 --> 00:13:15.819\nWhere we looked at the fact that maybe\nif you give somebody something for free,\n\n206\n00:13:15.819 --> 00:13:17.661\nthen maybe they perceive value in it,\n\n207\n00:13:17.661 --> 00:13:22.670\neven though they didn't necessarily want\nthat particular item in the first place.\n\n208\n00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:25.565\nYou can influence value perception,\nhowever,\n\n209\n00:13:25.565 --> 00:13:27.618\nyou can influence it in both ways.\n\n210\n00:13:27.618 --> 00:13:31.638\nAnd if what's happening is that that lead\nsupplier is causing conflict between\n\n211\n00:13:31.638 --> 00:13:35.838\nthe other suppliers, then obviously that's\ngonna influence value perception in\n\n212\n00:13:35.838 --> 00:13:37.520\na negative way as well.\n\n213\n00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.140\nSo a lead supplier has to understand\nif they do act in that way, if they\n\n214\n00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:47.170\ndo act in what we might consider to be an\nunscrupulous way or an unprofessional way.\n\n215\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:51.210\nThen that could influence the customer\nin a negative manner too.\n\n216\n00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.050\nAnd actually, that could have\na detrimental effect on their\n\n217\n00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.640\nability to provide a service,\nrather than a positive effect.\n\n218\n00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.290\nAnd they may find that they don't\nactually get any additional work, but\n\n219\n00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.930\nthey might even get less\nwork from the customer.\n\n220\n00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:06.800\nSo the lead supplier is,\nas a service integrator,\n\n221\n00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.750\nis a structure that you've got to be very,\n\n222\n00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:17.160\nvery comfortable and very trusting\nwith that particular supplier.\n\n223\n00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.738\nYou have to have a very good\nrelationship with that supplier, and\n\n224\n00:14:20.738 --> 00:14:23.945\nyou have to ensure that that\nsupplier remains impartial.\n\n225\n00:14:23.945 --> 00:14:28.363\nSo whilst at first glance, you might think\nabout, actually this seems like a really,\n\n226\n00:14:28.363 --> 00:14:29.460\nreally easy option.\n\n227\n00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:35.140\nThe reality of the situation is that\nit's not quite as easy as it may first\n\n228\n00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.380\nappear.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n229\n00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.020\nJo, that brings me to a question\nabout selecting these individuals.\n\n230\n00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.710\nWe talked about,\nthere should be no overlap for\n\n231\n00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.810\nthe external service providers.\n\n232\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:48.780\nShould we also consider the internal\nservice providers when making\n\n233\n00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:49.560\nthat selection?\n\n234\n00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:55.720\nTo make sure their not essentially\ncausing, we've talked about that conflict.\n\n235\n00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.350\nBut we should also consider the internal\nservices that are being provided to us\n\n236\n00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.560\nwhen we're making that selection,\nif we decide to go this route,\n\n237\n00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.410\ncorrect?\n&gt;&gt; Right, in any structure, whether we're\n\n238\n00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:09.692\ntalking about an internal or an external\nor a hybrid or even an elite supplier.\n\n239\n00:15:09.692 --> 00:15:14.835\nIn any structure for service integrator,\nthere could possibly be tension.\n\n240\n00:15:14.835 --> 00:15:18.803\nAnd one of the roles of the service\nintegrator is actually to alleviate\n\n241\n00:15:18.803 --> 00:15:19.684\nthat tension.\n\n242\n00:15:19.684 --> 00:15:24.260\nAnd it's to ensure that all of\nthe parties, all of our service providers,\n\n243\n00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.000\nwork together in a collaborative and\ncohesive way.\n\n244\n00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.900\nCohesive simply means joined together, but\n\n245\n00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:34.280\ncollaboration is more about having\nthat trust in that relationship.\n\n246\n00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.240\nNow obviously,\nthat's not necessarily easy as it sounds.\n\n247\n00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.240\nAnd if the service integrator,\nwhich in this instance,\n\n248\n00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.630\nthe service integrator is\nactually one of the suppliers,\n\n249\n00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:49.410\nthen that could cause that conflict\nof interest that may prevent that.\n\n250\n00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:54.846\nUltimately the customer has got to, well,\nthey've gotta weigh out the pros and cons.\n\n251\n00:15:54.846 --> 00:15:57.734\nThey've gotta look at the advantages and\n\n252\n00:15:57.734 --> 00:16:03.270\nthe disadvantages of each particular\ndecision that they think about making.\n\n253\n00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:07.130\nAnd so that's something that's got to\nbe mentioned in the business case.\n\n254\n00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.260\nAnd it's also something that's got\nto be considered in the planning and\n\n255\n00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.870\nthe implementation phases.\n\n256\n00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:18.049\nWhere we need to ensure that if we do\ndetect any elements of impartiality,\n\n257\n00:16:18.049 --> 00:16:23.044\nor we detect any opportunities for\nimpartiality to exist.\n\n258\n00:16:23.044 --> 00:16:26.040\nThat we close the door on that\none pretty much straight away.\n\n259\n00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.330\n&gt;&gt; And that makes perfect sense,\n\n260\n00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.960\nright, you need to keep your finger\non the pulse of things, so to speak.\n\n261\n00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.770\nOne final question about this,\nand I think I know the answer.\n\n262\n00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:37.160\nWhich I kind of set my self up for\na deflection question there.\n\n263\n00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.110\nBut we talked about this lead\nsupplier being promoted.\n\n264\n00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:45.980\nPromoted, I use that word loosely,\nfrom an external service provider.\n\n265\n00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.050\nHowever, if I took all of my\nservice providers, internal and\n\n266\n00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:53.630\nexternal, and I said, I want that\none to become my service integrator.\n\n267\n00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.532\nIf it's the internal, then they just\nbecome an internal service integrator,\n\n268\n00:16:57.532 --> 00:16:59.987\nare they now a lead supplier?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n269\n00:16:59.987 --> 00:17:01.691\n&gt;&gt; Okay, they're just now a service\n\n270\n00:17:01.691 --> 00:17:05.629\nintegrator, and that becomes their primary\nrole as far as the service that they\n\n271\n00:17:05.629 --> 00:17:07.746\nare providing internally to the company,\n\n272\n00:17:07.746 --> 00:17:08.625\ncorrect?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n273\n00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:11.893\nany service provider's gotta be evaluated,\nit has to be.\n\n274\n00:17:11.893 --> 00:17:14.777\nAnd they have to be evaluated\nbased on their merits and\n\n275\n00:17:14.777 --> 00:17:17.350\nbased on what they can bring to the table.\n\n276\n00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:20.610\nAnd so,\nwhether we choose to remain internal or\n\n277\n00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:24.990\nwhether we choose to go external, or\nmaybe have some hybrid structure,\n\n278\n00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:30.620\nit has to be whatever decision is deemed\nto be the best for the organization.\n\n279\n00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.946\nThink about this,\nin the situation that we've got right now,\n\n280\n00:17:33.946 --> 00:17:36.784\nif we just take a look at\nthat particular slide again.\n\n281\n00:17:36.784 --> 00:17:41.187\nYou'll see our customer has retained\ncapabilities, they have retained\n\n282\n00:17:41.187 --> 00:17:45.730\nthe decision making, and we talked\nabout that in a previous episode.\n\n283\n00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:50.240\nBut then what we've done is we've retained\nthe decision making and the strategy, and\n\n284\n00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.760\nwe've handed off everything\nelse to somebody else.\n\n285\n00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.770\nIf you're going to do that to somebody\nexternal, no matter who that is,\n\n286\n00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:59.876\nwhether it's an existing supplier or\n\n287\n00:17:59.876 --> 00:18:03.784\nwhether it's another organization\nthat you've gone out to source.\n\n288\n00:18:03.784 --> 00:18:07.846\nIt's gotta be somebody with experience,\nso you have to see evidence of that\n\n289\n00:18:07.846 --> 00:18:11.490\nexperience, but\nit has to be somebody that you can trust.\n\n290\n00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:17.196\nYou see, as a customer, I just want\nto be able to, I've made a decision,\n\n291\n00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:21.349\nthis is what I want,\nthis is what a perceive as value.\n\n292\n00:18:21.349 --> 00:18:26.220\nAnd here's some money,\nnow deliver me value.\n\n293\n00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.123\nThat's what my customer is saying,\ndon't deliver me a headache,\n\n294\n00:18:30.123 --> 00:18:32.340\ndon't deliver me stress.\n\n295\n00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:38.505\nWhat I want is for you to deliver me what\nI value, I don't want anything else.\n\n296\n00:18:38.505 --> 00:18:41.580\nAnd that's what the customer\nis saying essentially.\n\n297\n00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.392\nAnd so we really, as a customer,\nwe're empowering that service\n\n298\n00:18:46.392 --> 00:18:51.360\nintegrator to act on our behalf and\nto act in our best interest.\n\n299\n00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.220\nSo it's important that we make\nthat decision right upfront.\n\n300\n00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.400\nBy selecting somebody who is gonna act in\nour best interest and not going to act in\n\n301\n00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.680\ntheir own best interest.\n&gt;&gt; Well, these decisions are always hard\n\n302\n00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.688\nto make, and well, I do not envy\nthe individuals who are making them.\n\n303\n00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:10.068\nNow, Jo, we've taken a look at\nall of our service integrators.\n\n304\n00:19:10.068 --> 00:19:14.325\nAnd correct if I'm wrong, we have a pretty\ngood overview, do we still have more to\n\n305\n00:19:14.325 --> 00:19:17.781\ncover as far as service integrators\nas an individual subtopic, or\n\n306\n00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:20.194\nare we going somewhere else after this?\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n307\n00:19:20.194 --> 00:19:25.361\nnow we've concluded our little miniseries\non service integtrators, and now what\n\n308\n00:19:25.361 --> 00:19:30.547\nwe're going to do is we're gonna get into\nthe the juicy bits of the SIAM practices.\n\n309\n00:19:30.547 --> 00:19:35.710\nAnd everything, all the activities that\na SIAM ecosystem has to undertake.\n\n310\n00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.818\n&gt;&gt; Well, that does sound juicy indeed, so\n\n311\n00:19:37.818 --> 00:19:39.740\ndefinitely come on back and join us.\n\n312\n00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:43.030\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and get\nout of here, so signing off for ITProTV,\n\n313\n00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.526\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n314\n00:19:45.526 --> 00:19:46.580\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n315\n00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:53.885\n[MUSIC]\n\n316\n00:19:53.885 --> 00:19:56.778\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.985\nWelcome to ITPRO TV,\nI'm your host [INAUDIBLE].\n\n2\n00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:08.221\n[MUSIC]\n\n3\n00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:11.715\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:15.914\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone, and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.914 --> 00:00:20.435\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and we're\ncontinuing on with our SIAM Foundation\n\n6\n00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:24.704\nseries and well, we're actually going to\nbe digging into SIAM practices In this\n\n7\n00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:27.589\nepisode, and well,\nthat's kind of a broad term, but\n\n8\n00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.831\nluckily we have someone that will clear\nup everything for us, Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:32.782\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n\n10\n00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:34.170\n&gt;&gt; Concerned, actually.\n\n11\n00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.977\nYou are setting quite\na high expectation for me.\n\n12\n00:00:35.977 --> 00:00:36.772\n&gt;&gt; That is what I do.\n\n13\n00:00:36.772 --> 00:00:38.110\n&gt;&gt; So I'm incredibly concerned.\n\n14\n00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.404\n&gt;&gt; That is what I, I over-promise\n&gt;&gt; And then we underdeliver.\n\n15\n00:00:41.404 --> 00:00:42.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n16\n00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.850\nI joke because if this was up to me and\n\n17\n00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.530\nI had to tell you about SIAM practices,\nwell this would be the end of the show.\n\n18\n00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.382\nSo luckily,\nJo knows a little more than I do.\n\n19\n00:00:51.382 --> 00:00:52.731\n&gt;&gt; Maybe a tad.\n\n20\n00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:53.966\nJust a tad.\n\n21\n00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:58.854\nOne thing that I do wanna do though,\nbefore we really get going on this is I\n\n22\n00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:03.024\njust wanna remind everybody\nthat in this particular series,\n\n23\n00:01:03.024 --> 00:01:07.609\nwe are studying for the SIAM\nfoundation exams through BCS and EXIN.\n\n24\n00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:11.898\nAnd so everything that we cover in\nthis particular series is geared\n\n25\n00:01:11.898 --> 00:01:16.572\ntowards not only you having an\nunderstanding of the SIAM ecosystem, but\n\n26\n00:01:16.572 --> 00:01:20.862\nalso geared towards you preparing for\nyour foundation tests, and\n\n27\n00:01:20.862 --> 00:01:23.562\nthen also setting your foundation test.\n\n28\n00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:29.640\nAnd so we do have episodes where we will\nreview your SIAM, the sample paper for\n\n29\n00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.080\nyou, just to give you preparation for\nyour actual foundation test.\n\n30\n00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.901\nSo everything that we cover, and I said\nthis right at the very first episode\n\n31\n00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:45.100\nwhere I said, everything from here on\ninwards could be part of your test.\n\n32\n00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.930\nAnd even though it may seem in\nour episodes that we do a lot of\n\n33\n00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.180\nconversing, we do a lot of talking.\n\n34\n00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.450\nNevertheless we're still preparing you for\nyour test.\n\n35\n00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.833\nSo everything that we talk about,\n\n36\n00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:01.786\nwe could be referring to\nsomething that's in your test.\n\n37\n00:02:01.786 --> 00:02:03.266\nAnd SIAM practices is,\n\n38\n00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:08.280\nwell, something else that we're\ndefinitely going to have in your test.\n\n39\n00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.030\nIt's definitely going to appear, it's\nsomething that we have to bear in mind\n\n40\n00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.850\nwhen we are implementing Xian ecosystem\nthat we have what we call Practices.\n\n41\n00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.940\nI like to consider these, or I like\nto call these rather, Considerations.\n\n42\n00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.540\nThese are a four considerations\nthat we have within the SIAM\n\n43\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.224\necosystem that we have\nto have governance for.\n\n44\n00:02:31.224 --> 00:02:35.430\nAnd those four practices that\nrequire governments, governance,\n\n45\n00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.635\nnot governments, [LAUGH] But\ngovernance are our people practices,\n\n46\n00:02:39.635 --> 00:02:43.251\nour process practices,\nour measurement practices, and\n\n47\n00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:47.600\nour technology practices that\nare on the screen in front of you.\n\n48\n00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.810\nSo the four practices then\nthat we have within SIAM, or\n\n49\n00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.740\nour four considerations that require\ngovernance, are our People practices,\n\n50\n00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:02.220\nprocess practices, our measurement\npractices and our technology practices.\n\n51\n00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.370\nSo in terms of each one of these\npractices, then as I've already said,\n\n52\n00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.890\nwe need to have some governance and\n\n53\n00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.260\nsome policies in place to allow\nus to manage each one of these.\n\n54\n00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.749\nSo in the SIAM ecosystem, I know I\nam going to catch Justin completely\n\n55\n00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:22.331\noff-guard, although that was it.\n\n56\n00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:24.030\nThat was a couple of seconds warning.\n\n57\n00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.290\nWho do you think manages these?\n\n58\n00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.320\n&gt;&gt; Man, I'm...\n\n59\n00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.874\nThe respective practices,\nI'm gonna go with the Board,\n\n60\n00:03:36.874 --> 00:03:40.152\nthat's always my answer I guess.\n\n61\n00:03:40.152 --> 00:03:43.209\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n62\n00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.310\n&gt;&gt; The working group?\n\n63\n00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.974\nRight, okay, so\nyou're considering maybe even the forums.\n\n64\n00:03:54.974 --> 00:04:01.187\nBut I said who, and I what I was\nthinking about was which layer.\n\n65\n00:04:01.187 --> 00:04:06.802\n&gt;&gt; So, we're talking about the custom\norganization, customer organization.\n\n66\n00:04:06.802 --> 00:04:07.354\n&gt;&gt; Yea.\n\n67\n00:04:07.354 --> 00:04:11.077\n&gt;&gt; Versus the service integrator?\n\n68\n00:04:11.077 --> 00:04:12.145\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the service integrator.\n\n69\n00:04:12.145 --> 00:04:15.555\n[LAUGH] Yeah, we got there,\nwe got there actually.\n\n70\n00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:17.752\nThe service integrator\nactually manages all of these.\n\n71\n00:04:17.752 --> 00:04:21.974\nBut you're right, we are gonna have,\nboards are going to make some decisions.\n\n72\n00:04:21.974 --> 00:04:24.585\nWe've already spoken about\nthese in previous episodes.\n\n73\n00:04:25.605 --> 00:04:29.480\nProcess forums are going\nto make some decisions.\n\n74\n00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.140\nAnd working groups might make some,\nbut very few.\n\n75\n00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.900\nBecause working groups,\nif we remember from previous episodes,\n\n76\n00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.960\nworking groups are convened for\na specific purpose.\n\n77\n00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.970\nSo, we'll have our forums, for\ninstance, our process forums, That will\n\n78\n00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.230\nallow us to make decisions on processes\nand maybe even on measurement practices.\n\n79\n00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.805\nBut we also have various, all\nthe governance bodies within the service\n\n80\n00:04:56.805 --> 00:05:01.440\nintegrator layer that will help us\nto make these decisions such as\n\n81\n00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.510\ncontinual service improvement which may\nhelp us with our measurement practices.\n\n82\n00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.590\nBut also, service level management as\na process that will help us with our\n\n83\n00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.760\nmeasurement practices.\n\n84\n00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.520\nNow the one that none of these\nprocesses will help us with\n\n85\n00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.070\nare the people practices.\n\n86\n00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.370\nAnd this is interesting,\nthis is over and above.\n\n87\n00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:29.340\nAnything that we would ever consider in\nSIAM Itil or in an ISO 20,000 framework.\n\n88\n00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.230\nWe don't necessarily consider\ntoo much the people.\n\n89\n00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.215\nWe will talk about functional areas and\nwe talk about functional teams or\n\n90\n00:05:37.215 --> 00:05:41.680\nfunction being a group of people and\nthe tools that they use.\n\n91\n00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.393\nBut we don't consider the practices for\nthese people.\n\n92\n00:05:45.393 --> 00:05:50.277\nHere we have to, because we are in\nan ecosystem where we are talking\n\n93\n00:05:50.277 --> 00:05:55.092\nacross suppliers and\nwe're talking across service providers.\n\n94\n00:05:55.092 --> 00:05:59.700\nSo we have to have practices for\ngoverning the people.\n\n95\n00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.370\nWe have to have practices for\nmanaging the people\n\n96\n00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.630\nbecause we have what we call\nCross-functional Teams and\n\n97\n00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.570\nwe have teams that will help us\nto manage the functional areas.\n\n98\n00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.530\nAnd as Justin's already mentioned,\nwe've mentioned Boards.\n\n99\n00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.288\nWe've mentioned Process Forums and\nWorking Groups, and they will all\n\n100\n00:06:22.288 --> 00:06:27.369\nassist us to manage those, well,\nto manage all of the people perspective.\n\n101\n00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:30.190\nThink about the challenges that we've got,\nand I've got a slide.\n\n102\n00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.310\nAnd I think we'd like go,\nit's easier to go full screen on that.\n\n103\n00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.346\nThink about the slides, or\nthe challenges that we have\n\n104\n00:06:38.346 --> 00:06:42.570\nwith our organization when\nwe are talking across teams.\n\n105\n00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.950\nWe're talking across service providers.\n\n106\n00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.110\nWe've got things like conflicting\nobjectives, and organizational strategies,\n\n107\n00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.400\nand working practices.\n\n108\n00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.230\nA reluctance to share knowledge and\na lack of automation.\n\n109\n00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.365\nI mean there are some sort of\nobservations in there, but really,\n\n110\n00:06:59.365 --> 00:07:01.930\nlet's consider then\nthe conflicting objectives and\n\n111\n00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.670\nthe organizational strategies and\nworking practices.\n\n112\n00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:09.720\nAnd just imagine for\na moment that as a service integrator\n\n113\n00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.600\nyou are dealing with, you are managing\na group of service providers.\n\n114\n00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.820\nMany service providers.\n\n115\n00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.365\nAnd every single one of those service\nproviders is going to have a different\n\n116\n00:07:21.365 --> 00:07:25.710\ncorporate vision, They're gonna have\ndifferent corporate objectives.\n\n117\n00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:30.060\nSure, some of these might be internal,\ninternal to the customer organization.\n\n118\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.120\nBut most of these, I'd expect,\nwould be external.\n\n119\n00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.910\nAnd therefore,\neach one of them will have, as I said,\n\n120\n00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.859\ndifferent strategies and\ndifferent objectives.\n\n121\n00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:39.870\nWhat if they conflict?\n\n122\n00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.200\nYou know,\nlet's think about this logically.\n\n123\n00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.908\nAs an individual, when you want to go and\n\n124\n00:07:47.908 --> 00:07:52.379\nyou want to buy say an Internet\nservice provision, for instance.\n\n125\n00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:55.965\nOr as a small organization When\nwas the last time you were\n\n126\n00:07:55.965 --> 00:07:59.871\nable to go to a supplier and\nnegotiate terms and conditions?\n\n127\n00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:01.953\nGenerally, you go to a supplier.\n\n128\n00:08:01.953 --> 00:08:06.705\nAs a small organization, and you say, I\ndon't like to have some intonation, okay,\n\n129\n00:08:06.705 --> 00:08:09.939\nthese are the offerings that\nwe have available to you, and\n\n130\n00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:12.630\nyou have to pick one of those offerings.\n\n131\n00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:17.090\nYou don't get to select your own,\nmore importantly than that,\n\n132\n00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.590\nyou don't get to select and picking\nchose your own terms and conditions.\n\n133\n00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.730\nMaybe they've got a sort of a catalog\nof various different options,\n\n134\n00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:30.210\nand we call those service level packages,\nmaybe they've got set of packages that you\n\n135\n00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:35.610\ncan choose from, but you do not get to\ndictate your own terms and conditions.\n\n136\n00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.888\nSo, if you are a smaller organization and\n\n137\n00:08:38.888 --> 00:08:43.581\nyou're not able to negotiate\nwith your service provider.\n\n138\n00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:47.782\nWell, okay, you might be able to tolerate\nthat with one service provider, but\n\n139\n00:08:47.782 --> 00:08:52.090\nthen you've got three, or four, or\nfive, or six service providers.\n\n140\n00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:56.290\nAnd each one of them has got their own\nstandard contract that they are offering\n\n141\n00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:03.660\nyou, and you have to agree to that\nparticular standard contract.\n\n142\n00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:11.160\nAnd what is they object, not object, but\nwhat if they conflict, and what do we do?\n\n143\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.440\nYou got a challenge, and\nthen a different working practices,\n\n144\n00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.990\njust simple little things like,\nI am going to give you an incident and\n\n145\n00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.670\nwhen I give you an incident I'm going\nto log in to our call log in system and\n\n146\n00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.370\nI'm gonna pass that to you\nin the call log in system.\n\n147\n00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:32.030\nAnd then that particular service provider\nsaid, well, we don't use that call log in\n\n148\n00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.650\nsystem, and when we get incidents in,\nthey come in over our phone.\n\n149\n00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.940\nAnd then another service provider said,\nwell,\n\n150\n00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:42.420\nif you passing it to us, you can't\nphone us, it's gonna be done via email.\n\n151\n00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.650\nAnd all of those differing\nworking practices\n\n152\n00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:50.290\nto do with the people perspective,\nto do with our organization.\n\n153\n00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.490\nAnd then, let's go on to that next one,\n\n154\n00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.580\nbecause that next one talks about\nthat reluctance to share knowledge.\n\n155\n00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.260\nAnd that reluctance to share knowledge,\nwhich is the next one,\n\n156\n00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.230\nif we can have that up on the screen,\nthen again,\n\n157\n00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.770\nwe've got data, but\nwho do we share that data with?\n\n158\n00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.580\nIf I'm in the customer, and\nI am calling my first service provider to\n\n159\n00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.550\nraise an incident, then they could have\npassed that incident to somebody else,\n\n160\n00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.050\nand it's then gonna be\npassed onto somebody else.\n\n161\n00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.790\nWhat data is passed on?\n\n162\n00:10:20.796 --> 00:10:25.440\nI have even seen some organizations\nwhere they refuse to pass on the actual\n\n163\n00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.990\nname of the customer,\nbecause that is not information that,\n\n164\n00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.410\napparently, the next service\nprovider needs to know.\n\n165\n00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:37.620\nNow, we can resolve this using automation,\nbut\n\n166\n00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.510\nif there isn't any automation there,\nthen it's not so easy to resolve, but\n\n167\n00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:45.590\nalso you have to then consider\nwhat you're going to automate.\n\n168\n00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:53.820\nAnd so the way to resolve this, the way\nto ensure that we have organizational,\n\n169\n00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.870\nwell, efficiency should we say,\nin our people practices,\n\n170\n00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:02.910\nis to ensure that we've got clear goals\nand responsibilities and clear roles.\n\n171\n00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:09.800\nAnd that we have a data, a knowledge, and\ninformation defined very, very clearly,\n\n172\n00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.170\nand then we've got our communication\nroles defined clearly, as well.\n\n173\n00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:20.080\nAnd our communication methods defined too,\nand that our toll sets are integrated.\n\n174\n00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.440\nThere's one thing that I wanna bring in\nthough, when we talk about communication,\n\n175\n00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.260\nand this is gonna be really\na key to absolutely everything.\n\n176\n00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:32.411\nSo Justin, I'm gonna ask you a question,\ncuz I like doing this.\n\n177\n00:11:32.411 --> 00:11:35.550\nWhat language do we communicate in?\n\n178\n00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.733\n&gt;&gt; See,\nI feel like this is a trick question,\n\n179\n00:11:37.733 --> 00:11:41.313\nbecause I'm immediately wanted to\nsay English, but then I was like,\n\n180\n00:11:41.313 --> 00:11:45.637\nwait a minute, is she talking about the\nspoken language, or the written language.\n\n181\n00:11:45.637 --> 00:11:48.789\nOr is she talking to a more abstract way,\nlike, Well,\n\n182\n00:11:48.789 --> 00:11:52.930\nis it the method of communicate,\nlike the language the internet.\n\n183\n00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.630\nSo, maybe I am overthinking it, Joe, but\n\n184\n00:11:54.630 --> 00:12:00.200\nI want to revert back to my previous\ncomment and say, the English language.\n\n185\n00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:06.460\n&gt;&gt; No, no, now,\nordinarily communication should\n\n186\n00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:11.800\nalways be in the language of the audience,\nwhatever the audience is speaking.\n\n187\n00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.370\nAnd I'm not talking about English or\nFrench or Spanish,\n\n188\n00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:19.280\nwhat I'm actually talking about is if you\nare a user, then I'm going to talk to\n\n189\n00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.950\nyou in a user language, I'm not gonna\ntalk to you in technical language.\n\n190\n00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.470\nIf you're a technical person,\nthen I'm going to talk to you in\n\n191\n00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:31.010\na technical language, and\nthat's really important.\n\n192\n00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:35.890\nWhen we're talking about communication\nacross our service providers,\n\n193\n00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:40.440\nwe have to have agreement upfront as to\nhow we're going to talk with our service\n\n194\n00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.520\nproviders, and how each service provider\nis going to talk with each other.\n\n195\n00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:52.686\nWe all have different\nconcepts of certain acronyms.\n\n196\n00:12:52.686 --> 00:12:55.164\nIf you start talking about acronyms,\n\n197\n00:12:55.164 --> 00:13:00.121\nwho's to say that that person that's\non the other end of that communication\n\n198\n00:13:00.121 --> 00:13:05.010\nis going to have exactly the same\ninterpretation of that acronym as you do.\n\n199\n00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:11.780\nI quite often liken this to, to watching\na movie, have you ever read a book and\n\n200\n00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.860\nthen you've gone to\nthe cinema to see a film, and\n\n201\n00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.850\nyou've sat there and\nyou're watching this film and\n\n202\n00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.530\nyou think to yourself,\nthis is not what it says in the book.\n\n203\n00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:25.320\nThis is not how it is in the book,\nbecause you've added your interpretation\n\n204\n00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.050\nonto what you've read before\nyou've gone to watch the film.\n\n205\n00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.920\nBut so has the producer and\nthe director as well, then\n\n206\n00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.140\nwhen they've been directing the actors,\nand so has potentially the actors too.\n\n207\n00:13:36.735 --> 00:13:40.605\nSo everybody has their own\ninterpretation of the written word, and\n\n208\n00:13:40.605 --> 00:13:43.465\nit's exactly the same with a lot\nof the terminology that we use,\n\n209\n00:13:43.465 --> 00:13:45.615\neverybody has their own interpretation.\n\n210\n00:13:45.615 --> 00:13:49.745\nSo it's important that the language\nthat you're going to use\n\n211\n00:13:49.745 --> 00:13:54.165\nis clearly defined before\nwe get into all of this.\n\n212\n00:13:54.165 --> 00:13:58.710\nBecause once we get into all of the\nrelationships, then it's gonna be very,\n\n213\n00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.000\nvery difficult to clear up\nany misinterpretations.\n\n214\n00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.950\nAnd I could give you literally\n1,001 different challenges and\n\n215\n00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:11.380\ndifferent words that Justin and I use,\nor maybe they're the same words, but\n\n216\n00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.920\nJustin and I use differently.\n\n217\n00:14:14.238 --> 00:14:17.360\nAnd, I mean, we've both got\na fairly similar accent, and yet\n\n218\n00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.720\n[LAUGH] we use words differently, right?\n\n219\n00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:25.620\nWe absolutely do, and this is kind of,\nwhen you go into a domain specific area,\n\n220\n00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.159\ntechnology or whatnot,\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n221\n00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:30.910\n&gt;&gt; This is something that\nshould be pre-established.\n\n222\n00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:35.250\nI went to grad school for something\nI didn't go to undergrad for, and\n\n223\n00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.800\nI had to spend like three week going,\nI don't what that means.\n\n224\n00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.590\nYou're saying words to me, but\n\n225\n00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.390\nI'm not entirely sure that they\nmean what I think they mean.\n\n226\n00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:49.237\nOr even the whole of the message\nthat was given to me,\n\n227\n00:14:49.237 --> 00:14:53.259\nI need you to interpret this so\nI can create meaning, so\n\n228\n00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:56.947\nwe can have the same speaking terms,\nso to speak.\n\n229\n00:14:56.947 --> 00:15:00.349\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, we have to have a\nconsistency across the language that we're\n\n230\n00:15:00.349 --> 00:15:02.779\nusing, and you know,\nwhen we talk about practices,\n\n231\n00:15:02.779 --> 00:15:06.190\nwe have to have a consistency across\nall of the practices that we use.\n\n232\n00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:09.800\nWe're talking about multiple service\nproviders, and we're talking about,\n\n233\n00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.740\nyou know, multiple organizations that\nuse language in different ways, but\n\n234\n00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.540\nthey have different working practices,\n\n235\n00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:20.140\nand so we have to ensure that we\nhave that collaboration in place.\n\n236\n00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:24.900\nAnd that brings us into, well,\ncollaboration across that processes.\n\n237\n00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:30.860\nSo we have to have\nconsistent processes and\n\n238\n00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:37.160\npractices for these processes across all\nof our service provider organizations.\n\n239\n00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.900\nAnd again,\nlet's take a look at the challenges and\n\n240\n00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:44.580\nthat we have with integrating our\nprocesses, and with our process practices,\n\n241\n00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.910\nand integrating them across\nall of our service providers.\n\n242\n00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:52.013\nAgain, it goes back to sharing\ninformation, and it goes back to that\n\n243\n00:15:52.013 --> 00:15:56.854\nconsistency that we've already talked\nabout, so gaps across our activities.\n\n244\n00:15:56.854 --> 00:15:59.896\nAnd what about things\nlike reporting itself?\n\n245\n00:15:59.896 --> 00:16:01.880\nAnd we're gonna come on\nto that in a moment,\n\n246\n00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.251\nwe're gonna talk about\nmanagement practices too.\n\n247\n00:16:04.251 --> 00:16:06.374\nBut gaps in our processes.\n\n248\n00:16:06.374 --> 00:16:10.434\nAnd where some organizations will\nperform some processes manually,\n\n249\n00:16:10.434 --> 00:16:13.390\nand some organizations want to automate.\n\n250\n00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:20.530\nThink about the collaboration that the\nservice integrator has to put in place.\n\n251\n00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:23.340\nThis is the responsibility\nof the service integrator.\n\n252\n00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.880\nRight at the beginning of this episode,\nthat was the question that I ask.\n\n253\n00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.950\nWho has the responsibility for this?\n\n254\n00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:32.970\nAnd it's the service integrator that\nhas the responsibility for this.\n\n255\n00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:37.810\nIf there is poor relationship anywhere\nbetween any of our service providers,\n\n256\n00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.709\nthen the service integrator is\ngoing to have to identify that.\n\n257\n00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:44.308\nAnd that could be a challenge\nsometimes in itself,\n\n258\n00:16:44.308 --> 00:16:47.360\ntry to find out exactly where we failing.\n\n259\n00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.080\nAnd then I have to address\nthose poor relationships.\n\n260\n00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:58.560\nSo what we have to do is focus on what\neach process is trying to achieve,\n\n261\n00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.700\nand ensure that we have got\ncontinual process improvement.\n\n262\n00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.440\nRemember continual iterative\nprocess improvement.\n\n263\n00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.910\nOne improvement after\nthe next after the next.\n\n264\n00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.670\nMake sure that we have working groups,\n\n265\n00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:18.980\nsuch as a process forum\nto actually establish\n\n266\n00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.950\nrules for our processes, and how we're\ngoing to govern our processes, and\n\n267\n00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:29.620\nhow we're gonna manage the processes\nacross all of our service providers.\n\n268\n00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.701\nSo what about then our\nthird set of practices?\n\n269\n00:17:32.701 --> 00:17:38.061\nWell, of course our third set of practices\nare our end-to-end measurement practices.\n\n270\n00:17:38.061 --> 00:17:45.490\nAnd this is about the ability, as it says\nhere, to monitor a service end-to-end.\n\n271\n00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:50.423\nAn end-to-end service measurements,\nwhat that actually means is that\n\n272\n00:17:50.423 --> 00:17:55.129\nit is a combination of a component\nmetrics and also a process metrics.\n\n273\n00:17:55.129 --> 00:17:59.830\nAnd component metrics with technology\nmetrics plus process metrics equals\n\n274\n00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:04.130\nservice metrics,\nour end-to-end service metrics.\n\n275\n00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:08.290\nSo when my component metrics,\nI'm measuring things like availability,\n\n276\n00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:13.190\nI'm measuring up time, or\nmean time between failures.\n\n277\n00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:17.230\nThat's what I'm measuring or\nmean time between system incidents.\n\n278\n00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.380\nAgain, lots of acronyms there, but\n\n279\n00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.220\nthis is what I'm measuring\nin my component metrics.\n\n280\n00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.810\nWhereas in my process metrics,\n\n281\n00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:29.310\nI'm measuring how quickly\nI'm able to restore service.\n\n282\n00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.718\nSo, in my component metrics there,\nI'm measuring how often it fails.\n\n283\n00:18:33.718 --> 00:18:38.040\nMy process metrics, I'm measuring\nhow quickly I can get it back up and\n\n284\n00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.120\nworking once it's failed.\n\n285\n00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:45.510\nAnd the combination of two gives\nme my entrance service metrics.\n\n286\n00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.990\nBut if I've got different\nservice providers\n\n287\n00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:53.890\nthat are providing different\nelements of those metrics, and\n\n288\n00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:59.890\nI have to make sure that I get a full\nview of the end-to-end service.\n\n289\n00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:04.650\nBecause if I've got one supplier\nthat happens to be monitoring how\n\n290\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:09.160\noften a particular portion\nof the network fails.\n\n291\n00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.690\nBut then the incident management is\nactually done by say, I don't know,\n\n292\n00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.740\nthe service integrator or\nservice desk, and\n\n293\n00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.680\nthey are monitoring how quickly\nthey're able to restore service.\n\n294\n00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.390\nI have to be able to combine the two, so\nthey have to be in a similar format in\n\n295\n00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:29.390\norder for me to be able to see\nthe end-to-end service metric.\n\n296\n00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:33.398\nSo I have to understand my\nstrategic requirements.\n\n297\n00:19:33.398 --> 00:19:34.530\nI have to understand that.\n\n298\n00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.760\nBut look at the challenges\nthat we've got here,\n\n299\n00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.850\nsuch as that reluctance to\nshare information again,\n\n300\n00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:46.470\nthat inability to map the end-to-end, and\nnot even having the right amount of data.\n\n301\n00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.690\nThese are all challenges to me.\n\n302\n00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.270\nYou're looking perplexed, Justin.\n\n303\n00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:54.960\n&gt;&gt; So I'm thinking this, if you had\ntwo separate, someone's taking over\n\n304\n00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.120\nthe processes to respond when something\nthose arrived, but someone else is\n\n305\n00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.850\nmanaging the actual delivery of\nthe component of the service, right?\n\n306\n00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.188\nWe're talking about networks here.\n\n307\n00:20:04.188 --> 00:20:06.860\nI can foresee, and\n\n308\n00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:12.780\nI think this is actually the inability\nto map in the workflow, so it went down.\n\n309\n00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.680\nWho reports it, and\nhow do we make sure we mesh\n\n310\n00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.630\nlike this time of being taken care of and\nthis time of it actually going.\n\n311\n00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:26.580\nIt seems like there would be a huge,\nif you're not planning for this, a huge\n\n312\n00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:31.480\nmismatch and possible being able to say,\nthis incident relates to this resolution.\n\n313\n00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:36.970\nAnd now I can say well,\nhow are these performing?\n\n314\n00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.150\nEspecially if you have maybe minor ones or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n315\n00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.890\n&gt;&gt; And that's exactly why you\nmentioned the word planning.\n\n316\n00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.810\nThat's exactly why we've got to plan.\n\n317\n00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:50.524\nAnd if we look at sort of the effective\nmanagement perspective here,\n\n318\n00:20:50.524 --> 00:20:55.940\nwe look at what we can do to overcome\nthat challenge, and that is planning.\n\n319\n00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.780\nIt's really about having\na reporting framework.\n\n320\n00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.990\nWe have to ensure that that\nreporting framework goes across\n\n321\n00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:04.340\nall of our service providers.\n\n322\n00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:07.580\nAnd that we get all of that\ninformation consistently from\n\n323\n00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.980\nall of our service providers.\n\n324\n00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.640\nThis sounds as though this is fairly,\nwell,\n\n325\n00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.150\nit's gonna say it sounds fairly trivial.\n\n326\n00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.760\nAnd, in fact, when you think about\nthe amount of time that we're spending in\n\n327\n00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.870\ntalking about, this which is\nliterally only a few minutes.\n\n328\n00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:26.000\nAnd yet in the reality, this is a bit like\ntrying to negotiate service level targets\n\n329\n00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.220\nacross all of our service providers.\n\n330\n00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.230\nThis is not going to be something simple.\n\n331\n00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.928\nThis is not a simple solution\nthat we can put in place.\n\n332\n00:21:33.928 --> 00:21:39.090\nAnd looking at techniques like\nmaking out reports visual,\n\n333\n00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:43.520\nthat is not going to help unless we\nknow what it is we want to measure.\n\n334\n00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.820\nAnd measuring quality and quantity.\n\n335\n00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.190\nWell, we want to take our\nqualitative measures and\n\n336\n00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:50.280\nturn them into quantitative measures.\n\n337\n00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:55.340\nWhich is why, when we send in out surveys,\nwe will say on a scale of one to ten,\n\n338\n00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:00.880\ncould you please mark this in terms\nof how good you think the service is?\n\n339\n00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.240\nWe wanna turn the quality\ninto quantity measurements.\n\n340\n00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:10.150\nBut if we don't have a framework for\nreporting, this is not going to work.\n\n341\n00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.330\nSo this is gonna be a challenge,\nmost definitely.\n\n342\n00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:18.750\nAnd then of course another challenge that\nis really going to be absolutely huge for\n\n343\n00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:23.420\nus as a service integrator, and\nthat's going to be technology.\n\n344\n00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:29.602\nAnd technology challenges, well,\nas I've said, they're absolutely massive.\n\n345\n00:22:29.602 --> 00:22:31.342\nEvery single service provider,\n\n346\n00:22:31.342 --> 00:22:35.050\nit's potentially gonna be\nworking on something different.\n\n347\n00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:40.272\nWhat are the chances of all our service\nproviders working on exactly the same\n\n348\n00:22:40.272 --> 00:22:45.589\nevent management tool, or exactly\nthe same call log in tool, for instance?\n\n349\n00:22:45.589 --> 00:22:49.502\nThey're probably not exactly\nthe same knowledge management tool,\n\n350\n00:22:49.502 --> 00:22:52.673\nexactly the same configuration\nmanagement system, or\n\n351\n00:22:52.673 --> 00:22:57.160\nthe same tool to manage\nthe configuration management system.\n\n352\n00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:02.710\nIf you've got 10 different service\nproviders, you potentially have 30 or\n\n353\n00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:06.220\n40 different tools that are in use.\n\n354\n00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:11.030\nSo you have to have a strategy for\n\n355\n00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:15.030\ndealing with the relationships,\n\n356\n00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.860\nthe synergy between all of those tools.\n\n357\n00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:24.672\nSo managing the service providers across\nthe board is not that just as simple as\n\n358\n00:23:24.672 --> 00:23:29.607\njust saying, okay, well, you've got to\ntalk to him, and he's got to talk to her.\n\n359\n00:23:29.607 --> 00:23:31.454\nAnd it's not that simple,\n\n360\n00:23:31.454 --> 00:23:37.011\nI mean let's look at the challenges that\nare associated with technology itself.\n\n361\n00:23:37.011 --> 00:23:40.942\nSome people have old legacy tools,\nfor instance, and\n\n362\n00:23:40.942 --> 00:23:45.818\nthat can be well, something that's\nquite difficult to get rid of.\n\n363\n00:23:45.818 --> 00:23:50.181\nWe have to understand what tool we're\ngoing to use, whether we're going allow\n\n364\n00:23:50.181 --> 00:23:53.973\nour service providers to use that tool,\nthat would make more sense.\n\n365\n00:23:53.973 --> 00:23:57.808\nBut some service providers don't\nnecessarily want to use our tool.\n\n366\n00:23:57.808 --> 00:24:02.738\nAnd they might have some old legacy\ntools that may not be as effective\n\n367\n00:24:02.738 --> 00:24:04.740\nas we think our toolset is.\n\n368\n00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:08.350\nBut nevertheless, that's what they may\nstick with, because their existing\n\n369\n00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:13.980\ncustomers prefer to use\nthat old legacy system.\n\n370\n00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:18.493\nAnd then think about data transfer again,\nand how do we transfer the data?\n\n371\n00:24:18.493 --> 00:24:22.455\nAnd what portions of\nthe data do we transfer?\n\n372\n00:24:22.455 --> 00:24:26.190\nAnd what about the non-compliant\nservice providers.\n\n373\n00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:29.730\nThese are the people that don't\nwant to necessarily use our tool.\n\n374\n00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:33.169\nOr don't want to work in the same\nway that we work because, and\n\n375\n00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:37.749\nI've already mentioned this previously,\nbecause they work in a different way.\n\n376\n00:24:37.749 --> 00:24:41.365\nAnd therefore that fits in with all\nof their current customers, and\n\n377\n00:24:41.365 --> 00:24:43.020\nthat's how they want to work.\n\n378\n00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:46.704\nAnd they don't wanna change their\nworking practices just for us,\n\n379\n00:24:46.704 --> 00:24:49.811\nbecause that's gonna be difficult for\nthem to manage.\n\n380\n00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:56.904\nAnd of course, we have this architecture\nof how our tool is configured and\n\n381\n00:24:56.904 --> 00:25:00.201\nwhere our data sits and\nwhere our servers are and\n\n382\n00:25:00.201 --> 00:25:04.840\nwho has access to all of this data and\nwho has access to the servers.\n\n383\n00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.114\nBut what if we've got differing\narchitecture requirements,\n\n384\n00:25:09.114 --> 00:25:14.000\nthings like data storage,\ndata archiving, backups, restores.\n\n385\n00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.419\nIf we have got different requirements\nfrom our service provider and\n\n386\n00:25:18.419 --> 00:25:23.536\nour service providers, I've got\ndiffering requirements across the board,\n\n387\n00:25:23.536 --> 00:25:26.510\nacross all of these service providers.\n\n388\n00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.884\nAnd how do we manage that?\n\n389\n00:25:28.884 --> 00:25:33.110\nThis is not just a five-minute challenge.\n\n390\n00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:35.219\n&gt;&gt; Jo, I'm having bad flashbacks.\n\n391\n00:25:35.219 --> 00:25:37.441\nSo some of this I have\nnever interacted with.\n\n392\n00:25:37.441 --> 00:25:40.171\nBut this technology challenges,\nI have interacted with.\n\n393\n00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:40.971\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n394\n00:25:40.971 --> 00:25:44.950\n&gt;&gt; Because I've work in the capacity\nof one of the service providers.\n\n395\n00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:48.190\nBut then we had to work with other\ninternal service providers for\n\n396\n00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:49.960\nour respective customer.\n\n397\n00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.130\nAnd they're like, no,\nwe're not changing our architecture.\n\n398\n00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:54.020\nWell, you're asking me\nto do something that,\n\n399\n00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:58.600\ngiven that, we need to figure\nout how to make these mesh.\n\n400\n00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.540\nAnd it almost seems like\nyou have to be careful,\n\n401\n00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.510\nbecause you could have\na burgeoning landscape of, well,\n\n402\n00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:07.880\nI have another service provider\nthat its entire existence is\n\n403\n00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.360\nto create a connection between\nthese respective service providers.\n\n404\n00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.200\nAnd it can just kind of snowball on you,\nrIght?\n\n405\n00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.245\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you take a look at this, what\nwe got on the slide in front of us now,\n\n406\n00:26:18.245 --> 00:26:23.230\nyou see, we talk about a solution there as\nbeing a technology strategy and roadmap.\n\n407\n00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.120\nAnd that sounds really,\nreally simple, but it's not.\n\n408\n00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.940\nBecause as you've already said, we have\ngot other providers that will come along\n\n409\n00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:35.730\nand say, right, well, I'm gonna do, well,\nI've written some API codes into this.\n\n410\n00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:39.469\nAnd then that will take that information,\nand it's gonna put it into here.\n\n411\n00:26:39.469 --> 00:26:43.624\nAnd we're having to change the format\naround slightly to make it fit into there,\n\n412\n00:26:43.624 --> 00:26:46.570\nand that's all very well and\ngood for one relationship.\n\n413\n00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:50.430\nBut then when we have to then transfer\nthat data on to somebody else and\n\n414\n00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:54.460\nthen to somebody else,\nthen it starts getting very, very complex.\n\n415\n00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:58.738\nAnd by the way, if you're in the process\nof actually routing specific codes to get\n\n416\n00:26:58.738 --> 00:27:01.962\ndata from here to here and\nthey're not talking to each other,\n\n417\n00:27:01.962 --> 00:27:03.327\nthat's complex enough.\n\n418\n00:27:03.327 --> 00:27:04.776\nThat's one relationship.\n\n419\n00:27:04.776 --> 00:27:10.150\nThe last thing that you want to\ndo is add in other relationships.\n\n420\n00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:13.330\nWhen I was a kid,\nwe used to play games at school.\n\n421\n00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:17.200\nAnd I don't know what we call it over\nhere, I'll be perfectly honest, but\n\n422\n00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.560\nit's just a common kids game.\n\n423\n00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:23.370\nWe call it Chinese whispers in the UK,\nwhere somebody will whisper into your ear,\n\n424\n00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:24.690\nand they'll whisper one thing.\n\n425\n00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.827\nAnd then you go and whisper it to somebody\nelse, and then he goes and whispers, yeah?\n\n426\n00:27:27.827 --> 00:27:31.446\nYou know the game we have that-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we call that telephone, I think.\n\n427\n00:27:31.446 --> 00:27:34.783\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Where you start, you whisper something,\n\n428\n00:27:34.783 --> 00:27:37.040\nright, some innocuous phrase.\n\n429\n00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:37.761\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n430\n00:27:37.761 --> 00:27:41.424\n&gt;&gt; And then it transforms as it kinda\nmoves about the circle or the line or\n\n431\n00:27:41.424 --> 00:27:42.510\nwhatever it may be.\n\n432\n00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, I've seen that in IT,\nI've seen that in IT.\n\n433\n00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:49.685\nI have seen that where we have,\nin this particular ecosystem,\n\n434\n00:27:49.685 --> 00:27:51.490\nand I've seen this before.\n\n435\n00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:55.950\nThese ecosystems were established, in some\ninstances, where we've got data that's\n\n436\n00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:59.800\nbeen moved from one toolset to another,\nto another, to another.\n\n437\n00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.240\nAnd each time, it's being translated.\n\n438\n00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.220\nSometimes it's even actually physically\nbeing translated into different languages.\n\n439\n00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:11.710\nAnd then by the time it gets back to you,\nit is completely unrecognizable.\n\n440\n00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.240\nSo we have to have that map.\n\n441\n00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:20.630\nAnd we may even want to use\ncertain industry standard methods\n\n442\n00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:25.320\nto integrate our data and\nto integrate out toolsets together.\n\n443\n00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.940\nIt's very, very difficult, very difficult.\n\n444\n00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.710\nYou have to get the agreement from\nall of your service providers.\n\n445\n00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:36.510\nAnd for, actually, when I look back at all\nof these practices that we've discussed,\n\n446\n00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:39.440\nnot one of these practices\nis going to work\n\n447\n00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.100\nwithout the collaboration of\nall of our service providers.\n\n448\n00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:48.033\nAnd that, going back, right back to that\nfirst question that I asked you right\n\n449\n00:28:48.033 --> 00:28:51.799\nat the very beginning was,\nwhose responsibility is that?\n\n450\n00:28:51.799 --> 00:28:54.030\nThis is the service integrator.\n\n451\n00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:57.933\nAnd now in this last sort of 30\nminutes throughout this episode,\n\n452\n00:28:57.933 --> 00:29:01.915\nwe have just given the service\nintegrator a whole heap of work to do.\n\n453\n00:29:01.915 --> 00:29:07.317\n&gt;&gt; A whole heap of work, I don't even\nthink that starts to cover it, Jo.\n\n454\n00:29:07.317 --> 00:29:08.356\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n455\n00:29:08.356 --> 00:29:11.695\nwe talked about people practices, and\ndefinitely correct me if I miss something,\n\n456\n00:29:11.695 --> 00:29:14.558\npeople practices, process practices,\nmeasurement practices, and\n\n457\n00:29:14.558 --> 00:29:15.767\nthen technology practices.\n\n458\n00:29:15.767 --> 00:29:16.947\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n459\n00:29:16.947 --> 00:29:19.110\n&gt;&gt; And you're like, well that's only four.\n\n460\n00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.135\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n461\n00:29:20.135 --> 00:29:23.552\nthen each one of those has\na significant amount of considerations.\n\n462\n00:29:23.552 --> 00:29:27.310\nEspecially when you're trying to make\nsure the service providers are connecting\n\n463\n00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:30.550\nappropriately, that everybody\nhas the same corporate vision.\n\n464\n00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:35.860\nEverybody has the same vision for the\nrespective subparts of those practices.\n\n465\n00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.936\nAnd well,\nit's starting to make my head spin, Jo.\n\n466\n00:29:37.936 --> 00:29:43.390\nBut I'm sure, I'm sure as we continue on,\nwe'll gain a little bit of clarity.\n\n467\n00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.690\nWhich brings me to the question,\nwe've talked about practices,\n\n468\n00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.130\nwhere are we going from here?\n\n469\n00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:52.267\n&gt;&gt; Well, in our next episode when we\ncome back, we're going to be looking at\n\n470\n00:29:52.267 --> 00:29:56.035\nspecific roles and responsibilities\nwithin the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n471\n00:29:56.035 --> 00:29:59.450\nWe'll have a couple of episodes\nwhere we're going to look at those.\n\n472\n00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:04.309\nAnd then after that, we're gonna delve\nreally deep into our SIAM processes.\n\n473\n00:30:04.309 --> 00:30:05.451\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go.\n\n474\n00:30:05.451 --> 00:30:10.335\nWe're getting ready to find out who does\nwhat and whose responsibility is whose.\n\n475\n00:30:10.335 --> 00:30:13.450\nThere's a lot more coming at you, so\nyou should definitely join us back.\n\n476\n00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:14.920\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n477\n00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.990\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n478\n00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.940\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n479\n00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.284\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n480\n00:30:21.284 --> 00:30:27.320\n[MUSIC]\n\n481\n00:30:27.320 -->

[CROSSTALK]\n[SOUND]\n\n4\n00:00:08.365 --> 00:00:10.522\n&gt;&gt; Your're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:16.210\n&gt;&gt; Greetings, everyone, and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.597\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\nwe're continuing on with Siam Foundation.\n\n7\n00:00:19.597 --> 00:00:24.210\nAnd well, we're going to be diving\ninto the roles and responsibilities.\n\n8\n00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.493\nAnd luckily I'm not the one that\nthat's telling us all about roles and\n\n9\n00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:31.219\nresponsibilities, but instead we have\nan expert in studio with us today, Ms.\n\n10\n00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:31.844\nJo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:33.640\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n\n12\n00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.330\n&gt;&gt; I'm absolutely great,\nthank you, Justin.\n\n13\n00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.040\nHow are you?\n\n14\n00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.960\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic as well.\n\n15\n00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.680\nNow, last episode we talked about the four\npractices, right, the SIAM practices.\n\n16\n00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.850\nAnd I remember them, that's the trick.\n\n17\n00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.095\nWe have technology, we have people\npractices, we have process practices and\n\n18\n00:00:50.095 --> 00:00:51.910\nwe have measurement practices.\n\n19\n00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:52.840\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah.\n\n20\n00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.840\n&gt;&gt; I got them all.\n\n21\n00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.775\nBut now we're gonna dive into,\ncorrect me if I'm wrong.\n\n22\n00:00:57.775 --> 00:01:01.089\nWho does what and what their ultimate\nresponsibility or groups of people,\n\n23\n00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:01.885\nI guess, right?\n\n24\n00:01:01.885 --> 00:01:05.315\n&gt;&gt; Right, we're gonna look\nat the roles that we have.\n\n25\n00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:07.195\nWell, we're gonna look at planning roles,\nfirst of all.\n\n26\n00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:11.745\nAnd we're gonna look at the activities\nthat certain roles will perform,\n\n27\n00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:14.285\nbearing in mind that we're\nin the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n28\n00:01:14.285 --> 00:01:18.468\nIn the SIAM ecosystem we have\na service integrator, and\n\n29\n00:01:18.468 --> 00:01:21.680\nthen we have multiple service providers.\n\n30\n00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.090\nAnd we also have customers as well.\n\n31\n00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.450\nAnd customers have some\nretained capabilities, too.\n\n32\n00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.890\nSo we're looking at nonspecific roles,\n\n33\n00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.750\nbecause obviously each service provider is\ngoing to have their own level of skills.\n\n34\n00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.180\nThey're going to have their own role,\ntheir own responsibilities\n\n35\n00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.440\nwithin that particular contract that\nthey have with the service integrator.\n\n36\n00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.150\nAnd then I refer to it as a contract\nbecause I'm just making that assumption.\n\n37\n00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.390\nJust a generic sort of sweeping comment\n\n38\n00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.710\nthat all of our service providers are\ngoing to be external service providers.\n\n39\n00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.640\nOf course, that's not the truth, but\nthen, we don't know whether the service\n\n40\n00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.680\nintegrator is going to be internal or\nexternal, and\n\n41\n00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.790\nwhether our service providers\nare going to be internal or external.\n\n42\n00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.990\nOf course, if they're internal,\n\n43\n00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.500\nthen we're gonna be talking\nabout service level agreements.\n\n44\n00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.470\nBut for external suppliers, then we're\ngonna be talking about contracts.\n\n45\n00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.060\nSo I just use the generic term,\ncontract, really,\n\n46\n00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.490\njust to help clarify that,\njust to simplify the explanation.\n\n47\n00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.060\nSo what we need to do, when we are, no.\n\n48\n00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.450\nI'm gonna ask you, actually,\nJustin, just because I can.\n\n49\n00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:39.145\nWhen do you think we define the activities\nthat we expect each role and\n\n50\n00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:43.945\nresponsibility to undertake,\nor each role to undertake?\n\n51\n00:02:43.945 --> 00:02:45.585\n&gt;&gt; Maybe during the planning phase?\n\n52\n00:02:45.585 --> 00:02:52.100\n&gt;&gt; Right, now during a previous episode,\nI mentioned a RACI matrix.\n\n53\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.290\nAnd I know that that was something\nin the previous episode that\n\n54\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.010\nyou didn't know about, or\nthat you'd never heard of.\n\n55\n00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.240\nDid you remember any of that?\n\n56\n00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.770\n&gt;&gt; I remember the words RACI matrix,\nand if I'm not mistaken,\n\n57\n00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.220\nisn't it a matrix of individual\nstrengths or capabilities?\n\n58\n00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.412\nNope, I'm seeing the shake of a head, no.\n\n59\n00:03:14.412 --> 00:03:16.960\nI know it's a matrix for\ncheck boxes and that's all I got.\n\n60\n00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.810\nIt's a matrix for check boxes?\n\n61\n00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.010\nIt has check boxes.\n\n62\n00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.270\n&gt;&gt; No, it doesn't.\n\n63\n00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.850\n&gt;&gt; I was wrong.\n\n64\n00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.330\nDid we talk about another matrix?\n\n65\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No.\n\n66\n00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.280\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure we did, Jo.\n\n67\n00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.910\n&gt;&gt; No, we didn't, we didn't.\n\n68\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.876\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; No, no,\n\n69\n00:03:31.876 --> 00:03:36.654\nwhat we'll do is with any RACI matrix,\nwhat we do is we'll just take a grid,\n\n70\n00:03:36.654 --> 00:03:41.760\na table, and across the top we'll\ndenote who our stakeholders are.\n\n71\n00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.920\nAnd then for any given process,\ndown on one side,\n\n72\n00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.571\nwe list all of the activities\nthat exist within that process.\n\n73\n00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:53.650\nAnd then, in the corresponding box,\n\n74\n00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.900\nthe one that links that stakeholder\nto that particular process activity,\n\n75\n00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.197\nthen we'll put a letter in there and\nwe'll either put an R or an A,\n\n76\n00:04:02.197 --> 00:04:07.910\npotentially both, or a C, or an I, RACI.\n\n77\n00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.530\nAnd responsible, accountable for\nthat task, consulted and informed.\n\n78\n00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.769\nThere's only one rule in a RACI matrix,\n\n79\n00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.172\nthat only one person could be\naccountable for any given activity.\n\n80\n00:04:20.172 --> 00:04:22.120\nBut that's the only rule.\n\n81\n00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.610\nAnybody can be responsible, as many\npeople as you want can be responsible for\n\n82\n00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.370\nundertaking, completing an activity.\n\n83\n00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.010\nConsulted, well as many people\nas you want can be consulted and\n\n84\n00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.970\nyou can ask their opinions.\n\n85\n00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.840\nAnd then informed means to inform\nabout a particular activity or\n\n86\n00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.970\nabout the outcome of\na particular activity.\n\n87\n00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.480\nI do always tell people\nto get the balance right.\n\n88\n00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.290\nYou don't want too many people\nresponsible for a particular activity.\n\n89\n00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.560\nBut you don't want to consult\ntoo many people, either.\n\n90\n00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.660\nIf you consult too many people,\nwell, the more opinions you ask for,\n\n91\n00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.300\nthe more opinions you're going to get,\nright?\n\n92\n00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.630\nBut then you don't want to come\nacross as too dictatorial either, so\n\n93\n00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.800\nyou don't want to inform too many people.\n\n94\n00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.720\nYou want to ensure that you\ninvolve all of our stakeholders.\n\n95\n00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.580\nSo we defined the RACI matrix for\nany given process and\n\n96\n00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.760\nfor any given procedure that's\ndefined during the planning.\n\n97\n00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.370\nYou know what?\n\n98\n00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.610\nWe even have a RACI matrix for\n\n99\n00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.708\nthe actual implementation\nitself of the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n100\n00:05:24.708 --> 00:05:28.050\nSo a RACI matrix is\nsomething that's really,\n\n101\n00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.150\nreally useful when you're planning out\nspecific roles, when you're planning out\n\n102\n00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.230\nspecific processes, when you're\nplanning out specific projects as well.\n\n103\n00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.169\nWe'll use a RACI matrix for all of those.\n\n104\n00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.620\n&gt;&gt; And that makes a lot of sense,\nbut I have to ask.\n\n105\n00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.840\nIf I have both RACI or\n\n106\n00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.080\nall of them, not both, all of them,\ncan I just put a check mark?\n\n107\n00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.622\n&gt;&gt; No, you can't have all of them,\ncan you?\n\n108\n00:05:49.622 --> 00:05:54.540\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to find a in around\nabout that check mark comment.\n\n109\n00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.800\nI mean, I can see the validity or how this\ncan be helpful when making a plan, right?\n\n110\n00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.900\nYou're creating some kind of\nvisualization that gives you\n\n111\n00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.580\na broad brush kind of overlook of,\nokay, this person is accountable.\n\n112\n00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.030\nThese people are responsible,\ncuz you only get one accountable, right?\n\n113\n00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.730\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n114\n00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.190\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; You got that one right.\n\n115\n00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.020\n&gt;&gt; I'm learning something, Jo.\n\n116\n00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm impressed by that.\n\n117\n00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.420\n&gt;&gt; I'm not saying that I'll remember\nit in the next episode, but\n\n118\n00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.850\nI am learning something.\n\n119\n00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:19.780\n&gt;&gt; But we can hope.\n\n120\n00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.730\n&gt;&gt; And I know from consulting with,\n\n121\n00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.590\nif you ask too many people's opinions,\nyou may end up in analysis paralysis.\n\n122\n00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.356\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that makes a lot of sense to me\n\n123\n00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:31.290\nas well.\n\n124\n00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.430\nI also personally do not like\nwhen someone shows up and\n\n125\n00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.780\ngoes, this is the case always.\n\n126\n00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.880\nThat dictatorial bent with the illusion of\ndemocracy kind of puts me in a weird funk.\n\n127\n00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.790\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nyou've got to get the balance right.\n\n128\n00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.760\nSo and again, we want one person\naccountable, you've got that right, for\n\n129\n00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.220\nany given task.\n\n130\n00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.870\nBut then think about how many\npeople are gonna be responsible for\n\n131\n00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.580\nundertaking that task.\n\n132\n00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.730\nIt's exactly the same as if you send\nan email to absolutely everybody,\n\n133\n00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.260\nnobody's gonna action it.\n\n134\n00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.380\nNobody's gonna reply,\n\n135\n00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.710\nbecause everybody's going to assume\nthat somebody else is going to do it.\n\n136\n00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.585\nSo with any given task,\nwith any given activity,\n\n137\n00:07:11.585 --> 00:07:14.945\nconsider who's gonna be responsible for\nthat activity.\n\n138\n00:07:14.945 --> 00:07:19.315\nWith something like logging an incident,\nyou have one person accountable.\n\n139\n00:07:19.315 --> 00:07:21.490\nIt's generally the service desk manager,\nfor\n\n140\n00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.260\nensuring that all incidents are logged.\n\n141\n00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.320\nBut then anybody could be responsible for\nlogging an incident, absolutely anybody.\n\n142\n00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.220\nBut then whose opinion would you\nask about how to log an incident?\n\n143\n00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.190\nWell, you wouldn't really ask anybody's\nopinion, you just log the incident.\n\n144\n00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.540\nSo when it comes to logging an incident,\nthen maybe nobody's consulted or\n\n145\n00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.110\ninformed about that.\n\n146\n00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.230\nOr maybe we inform just the service\ndesk manager to say, hey,\n\n147\n00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.870\nlook, there's been these\nmany incidents logged.\n\n148\n00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:54.070\nBut then when it comes to prioritizing\nincidents, which is another activity, and\n\n149\n00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.330\nthen the person that's accountable, again,\nwould be the service desk manager for\n\n150\n00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.120\nensuring that all\nincidents have a priority.\n\n151\n00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.000\nBut then you would consult with the user.\n\n152\n00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.360\nYou'd ask their opinion, but\nit's not ultimately their decision.\n\n153\n00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.250\nThe decision on what that priority of\nthat incident should be actually lies in\n\n154\n00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.890\nthe SLA.\n\n155\n00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.590\nIt's an agreed in that\nparticular document, and\n\n156\n00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.270\nit's agreed up front, that this is what\nwould be considered a priority one, and\n\n157\n00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.110\nthis is what would be\nconsidered a priority two.\n\n158\n00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:31.060\nSo here we are in our planning\nmode in our SIAM ecosystem and\n\n159\n00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.010\nwe are planning those roles and\nresponsibilities.\n\n160\n00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:41.360\nSo here we are defining those RACI\nmatrices for all of our roles.\n\n161\n00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.570\nSo bear in mind, of course,\nthat this is not going to be as simple,\n\n162\n00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:46.942\ncuz nothing ever is.\n\n163\n00:08:46.942 --> 00:08:49.340\nThis is not going to be as\nsimple as we first thought,\n\n164\n00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:56.070\nbecause we are defining roles spread\nacross various service providers.\n\n165\n00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.966\nSo let's take a look at what's got\nto be done within our roles and\n\n166\n00:08:59.966 --> 00:09:04.560\nresponsibilities when we're planning for\nthese particular roles.\n\n167\n00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.830\nWe've got to define principles.\n\n168\n00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.084\nWe've actually got to define\nour designer processes.\n\n169\n00:09:10.084 --> 00:09:16.650\nWe've got to allocate the right\nresponsibilities to each particular role.\n\n170\n00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.210\nAnd then we've got to monitor, and\n\n171\n00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.460\nwe've got to improve\nthe performance of that role.\n\n172\n00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:27.030\nSo we've got an expansion of\nthat in our next slide here.\n\n173\n00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:32.490\nWe've got to during that discovery in\nstrategy phase, we have to got to define\n\n174\n00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:38.500\nthe policies for all of our processes and\nall of our roles.\n\n175\n00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:43.510\nAnd then, during plan and build,\nwe've then got to design those roles, and\n\n176\n00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:47.430\ndesign the responsibilities,\nand design the activities.\n\n177\n00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.660\nAnd then, during our implementation phase,\n\n178\n00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.030\nthen we've got to allocate\nthose responsibilities.\n\n179\n00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:58.509\nAnd then, of course once we in\nthe business as usual phase, within our\n\n180\n00:09:58.509 --> 00:10:02.980\nSIAM ecosystem, then we've got to monitor\nand we've got to improve those roles.\n\n181\n00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.760\nSo, at which point in time then do you\nthink we're actually deploying the roles?\n\n182\n00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.130\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing we're doing\nthat during allocation phase.\n\n183\n00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.350\nDuring the allocation of-\n&gt;&gt; During that implementation, yeah.\n\n184\n00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.650\nThat's when we are deploying them.\n\n185\n00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.760\nBut what about asking for\nfeedback on the responsibilities?\n\n186\n00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.530\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to say with the planning.\n\n187\n00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:31.570\n&gt;&gt; You see this is actually\nquite a huge chunk of work.\n\n188\n00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.360\nBecause this is not something that\nthe service integrator should do\n\n189\n00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.950\njust on their own.\n\n190\n00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:40.230\nThis is not something that the service\nintegrator can do in isolation.\n\n191\n00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.120\nBecause if I am service a integrator, and\n\n192\n00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.420\ngenerally a service integrator is a team,\na team of people.\n\n193\n00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.870\nIf I am a service integrator,\nthen I am going to\n\n194\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:54.590\ndocument what responsibilities I need,\nI'm going to do my RACI matrix, and\n\n195\n00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.690\nthen I'm gonna give it to you as a service\nprovider and I'm gonna say, right,\n\n196\n00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.100\nthis is what I need you to do and\nhow happy are you with that?\n\n197\n00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.990\n&gt;&gt; I am not gonna be,\n\n198\n00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:07.205\nI would reevaluate my position as\na service provider at this time.\n\n199\n00:11:07.205 --> 00:11:10.387\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's kind of a bit harsh.\n\n200\n00:11:10.387 --> 00:11:11.851\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know.\n\n201\n00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:12.743\nI do have a strong visceral response.\n\n202\n00:11:12.743 --> 00:11:14.750\n&gt;&gt; I mean you're being paid, right?\n\n203\n00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:18.160\n&gt;&gt; I know, but I have a strong visceral\nresponse of someone going here,\n\n204\n00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.870\nall your new things you have to do.\n\n205\n00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:22.678\nAnd I know, I get it.\n\n206\n00:11:22.678 --> 00:11:23.465\n&gt;&gt; You're being paid.\n\n207\n00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:29.021\n&gt;&gt; I totally get it, but I've seen over\nthe last few episodes that this is\n\n208\n00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:34.780\nalready a bunch of work that I may not\nnecessarily have the skill set for.\n\n209\n00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.380\nSo I'm talking from personal experience.\n\n210\n00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.690\n&gt;&gt; But then if I'm the service integrator,\nno, and I like this discussion.\n\n211\n00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:42.610\nThis is the real life discussion.\n\n212\n00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.350\nThis is what really happens.\n\n213\n00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.600\nIf I am the service integrator and\nI'm saying,\n\n214\n00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.390\nright, this is what my\ncustomer needs to happen.\n\n215\n00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.810\nI'm paying you a bunch\nof money to do this.\n\n216\n00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:00.400\nAnd then you're gonna turn around\nto me and say, well, you know what?\n\n217\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.480\nI'm not doing it, or words to that effect,\n\n218\n00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.245\nknowing Justin it will be\nwords to that effect, right?\n\n219\n00:12:06.245 --> 00:12:08.538\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So then what do I do?\n\n220\n00:12:08.538 --> 00:12:11.940\nI just turn around and say well that's\nfine, I'll find somebody who will?\n\n221\n00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:19.285\n&gt;&gt; I don't know Jo, as we said these\nare not black and white kind of decisions.\n\n222\n00:12:20.775 --> 00:12:24.786\nAnd let me further clarify I thought I\nwas the service integrator that was being\n\n223\n00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:28.272\nhanded them, but that would be\nthe person designing them, right?\n\n224\n00:12:28.272 --> 00:12:29.843\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nThe service integrator would be\n\n225\n00:12:29.843 --> 00:12:33.063\nlike here's all the stuff that needs to\nhappen, and then they're going to divvy up\n\n226\n00:12:33.063 --> 00:12:35.281\nthose responsibilities based\non the service provider.\n\n227\n00:12:35.281 --> 00:12:36.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd\n\n228\n00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.250\nthen the service provider's just gonna\nget, here are the things you have to do.\n\n229\n00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.100\nWouldn't that be part?\n\n230\n00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.120\nWe made the assumption at the beginning of\nthis episode that there was a preexisting\n\n231\n00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.130\ncontract.\n\n232\n00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.460\nAren't these fleshed out during the\ncontract, or am I misunderstanding that?\n\n233\n00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there wouldn't necessarily\nbe a preexisting contract.\n\n234\n00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.910\nAt this point in time what\nwe're doing is we're planning\n\n235\n00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.820\nthe implementation of the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n236\n00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.165\nNow, we're assuming that\nthere may be existing or\n\n237\n00:13:03.165 --> 00:13:07.120\npreexisting contracts with service\nproviders, but there may not be.\n\n238\n00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.720\nIt may be just that we want to move lock,\nstock, and\n\n239\n00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.980\nbarrel to a complete SIAM ecosystem.\n\n240\n00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.690\nOrdinarily, that's now how we evolve.\n\n241\n00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.430\nOrdinarily, we evolve because we've got\n\n242\n00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.970\na multitude of service providers\nthat we need to bring together, and\n\n243\n00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:27.930\nwe need to manage, and we need to add\ncollaboration and relationships in place.\n\n244\n00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.640\nSo if we've already got existing\ncontracts, then that means that me as\n\n245\n00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.710\na service integrator, I might be\nchanging those existing contracts.\n\n246\n00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.280\n&gt;&gt; You might be changing,\nbut you brought up a word.\n\n247\n00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.711\n&gt;&gt; I just saw that grin there.\n\n248\n00:13:38.711 --> 00:13:41.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You brought up a word called\n\n249\n00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.980\ncollaboration and\n\n250\n00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.340\ncollaboration doesn't elicit you\nsaying this is what you're gonna do.\n\n251\n00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.868\nCollaboration would be, here are the\nthings we need to accomplish in order to\n\n252\n00:13:49.868 --> 00:13:54.840\nfufill the respective services for\neverything.\n\n253\n00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:00.220\nWouldn't I, as a service provider,\nget input on this?\n\n254\n00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.630\nDo I get input on this?\n\n255\n00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but hang on a minute.\n\n256\n00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.070\nIf I am standing there as\na service integrator, and\n\n257\n00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:10.840\nI have got 15 service providers, and every\nsingle one of these service providers is\n\n258\n00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.140\nin this room and every single one of\nthem is saying, I'm not doing it.\n\n259\n00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:16.560\nThen what do I do?\n\n260\n00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.450\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI think having an appropriate discussion\n\n261\n00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.910\nis not necessarily no that I won't do it.\n\n262\n00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.609\nFurther clarifying my previous\nanswer was based on the assumption-\n\n263\n00:14:24.609 --> 00:14:26.562\n&gt;&gt; Well, it sounded like no I'm gonna do\n\n264\n00:14:26.562 --> 00:14:27.240\nthat today.\n\n265\n00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I may still say-\n&gt;&gt; Did it sound like that to you?\n\n266\n00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.290\n&gt;&gt; That I'm not gonna do it, but\n\n267\n00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.610\nI would expect there to be\nsome kind of discussion.\n\n268\n00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:38.920\nBecause as the service integrator,\nmaybe you have assumptions about\n\n269\n00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:44.610\nthe skill sets that my service has in\norder to provide in respect the service,\n\n270\n00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.040\nand maybe I need to clarify that.\n\n271\n00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:51.980\nWouldn't that be a reasonable\nexpectation during this phase?\n\n272\n00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.201\n&gt;&gt; Right, you know we're having\nthis discussion right now, but\n\n273\n00:14:55.201 --> 00:14:58.788\nthis is the exact discussion that\nthe service integrator needs to have\n\n274\n00:14:58.788 --> 00:15:00.360\nwith our suppliers.\n\n275\n00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.850\nAnd yes, the word, discussion,\nis really important.\n\n276\n00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:09.540\nHowever, we do have to bring into this\nfact that you're my service provider,\n\n277\n00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:10.740\nand I'm paying you money.\n\n278\n00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:17.870\nAnd if you don't want to do what I'm\nasking you to do, then well, guess what?\n\n279\n00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.860\nYou're not delivering value are you,\nto the customer?\n\n280\n00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.180\n&gt;&gt; That may be the case, but\n\n281\n00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:27.260\nmaybe I've been burnt way too many\ntimes by people asking unreasonable and\n\n282\n00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.740\npossibly outlandish things based on\nassumptions that they've made about\n\n283\n00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.140\nmy respective skill sets or\nability to provide set services.\n\n284\n00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.840\nSo I would anticipate that service\nproviders if this planning phase is going\n\n285\n00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.990\nthrough, this would become a discourse,\n\n286\n00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:48.040\nnot a hand down from high and\nsay this is what's gonna happen.\n\n287\n00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.500\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna have to\nwatch yourself though.\n\n288\n00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.426\nYou're brigning hyour baggage with\nyou into this world right now.\n\n289\n00:15:52.426 --> 00:15:56.729\n&gt;&gt; I am, I am, [LAUGH] And this is why I-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Justin's\n\n290\n00:15:56.729 --> 00:15:58.521\nour service provider, right?\n\n291\n00:15:58.521 --> 00:15:59.912\nYeah that's why.\n&gt;&gt; I am not this is,\n\n292\n00:15:59.912 --> 00:16:01.475\nI am not a service provider.\n\n293\n00:16:01.475 --> 00:16:03.735\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I tried it before, and they're, like,\n\n294\n00:16:03.735 --> 00:16:06.602\nwell, you just told us you\nweren't going to do that.\n\n295\n00:16:06.602 --> 00:16:08.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'm standing by it.\n\n296\n00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:08.782\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n297\n00:16:08.782 --> 00:16:10.498\n&gt;&gt; But this is why we have to have these\n\n298\n00:16:10.498 --> 00:16:12.958\ndiscussions.\nYou see, the other thing that happens\n\n299\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:17.450\nis that when it comes to responsibilities,\nas well is that assumptions are made, and\n\n300\n00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.910\na service integrator, I'm going to\nassume that you're happy to do this.\n\n301\n00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.030\nAnd unless you tell me otherwise,\n\n302\n00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:25.590\nthen as I say I'm going to\nassume you're happy to do that.\n\n303\n00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:29.780\nBut then, more importantly is\nthat I made that assumption.\n\n304\n00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.410\nI haven't told you anything about it and\nthen when you don't do what I'm assuming\n\n305\n00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:39.000\nyou're going to do,\nthat's when we get into problems.\n\n306\n00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.020\nWe also get into problems when you start\ndoing something just out of the kindness\n\n307\n00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.620\nof your heart or\njust because it's easy for you.\n\n308\n00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.582\nThat's never gonna happen.\n\n309\n00:16:46.582 --> 00:16:48.670\nThis is Justin, isn't it?\n\n310\n00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.390\nOkay, the other hypothetical\nservice provider,\n\n311\n00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.030\nwhen they start doing something out of\nthe kindness of their heart or they start\n\n312\n00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:59.990\ndoing something just because it's easy for\nthem to do, and it's not in the contract.\n\n313\n00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:05.300\nIt's not written down in black and\nwhite, then what happens is that service\n\n314\n00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:09.540\nprovider suddenly looks at what they're\ndoing and says, well, you know what?\n\n315\n00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.580\nI'm doing this and\nit's not part of my contract.\n\n316\n00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.360\nSo either, a,\nI'm not paying for it, or, b,\n\n317\n00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.040\nI don't want to do it anymore,\nwhich is it going to be?\n\n318\n00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.050\nAnd I have been in situations where I have\nseen service providers that have just\n\n319\n00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:26.060\nsuddenly stopped performing a duty\nbecause it wasn't written down.\n\n320\n00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.920\nMaybe they had a change of management,\nmaybe they've had a change of\n\n321\n00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.990\nleadership or there's been some change in\ndirection, and they stopped doing things.\n\n322\n00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:38.740\nAnd because it hasn't been written down,\nwe haven't had any racy matrices defined,\n\n323\n00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:43.500\nand we haven't had any roles and\nresponsibilities agreed.\n\n324\n00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.980\nBecause of that then that service provider\nsuddenly stopped doing something.\n\n325\n00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.480\nAnd there's been a huge big\ngap in service provision.\n\n326\n00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.210\nSo we have to have this written down.\n\n327\n00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.720\nWe really do.\n\n328\n00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:00.695\nSo when you think about if we take a look\nat the roles that we have here within that\n\n329\n00:18:00.695 --> 00:18:07.790\nSIAM ecosystem, we've got our customer\norganization and retain capabilities.\n\n330\n00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:11.410\nThese are the retain capabilities\nthat the customer has.\n\n331\n00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:17.290\nAnd then our service integrator and\nour service provider, they all have very\n\n332\n00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:24.350\nspecific roles to play in\nthis particular ecosystem.\n\n333\n00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.050\nBut there isn't any right or\nwrong in terms of roles,\n\n334\n00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:32.570\nit's entirely up to you as to which\nroles you want to give to any of your\n\n335\n00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:37.790\nservice providers, any of your service\nintegrators, any of your customers.\n\n336\n00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:42.780\nIt's entirely up to you as to how\nyou want to allocate those roles.\n\n337\n00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.740\n&gt;&gt; So Jo, I see that we have\nkind of these generic roles, but\n\n338\n00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:51.172\ndo you have any examples of more concrete\nroles that would be planned for?\n\n339\n00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:55.770\nSo yes, if you take a look at these\nslides that we've got available in our\n\n340\n00:18:55.770 --> 00:19:01.430\ndownloadable material, you'll see that\nwe have actually got some very sort of,\n\n341\n00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:06.570\njust examples of some typical roles within\neach of the layers of our ecosystem.\n\n342\n00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.750\nSo for instance,\nwithin our customer organization,\n\n343\n00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.340\nand we call these our\nretained capabilities.\n\n344\n00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:16.140\nWe have typical roles such as head of IT,\nhead of services,\n\n345\n00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.760\nthe actual service owners themselves.\n\n346\n00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.770\nThey may be doing sort of contract\nmanagement and demand management,\n\n347\n00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:24.560\nfinancial management.\n\n348\n00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:30.300\nAnd in fact we actually look at\nthe customers' roles specifically here and\n\n349\n00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.845\nwhat that role does.\n\n350\n00:19:31.845 --> 00:19:34.130\nAnd they are responsible for\n\n351\n00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:38.990\ndefining exactly what they value,\nwhat they want to achieve.\n\n352\n00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.140\nThey also define\nthe end-to-end budget as well,\n\n353\n00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.440\nwhich is how much money\nhave they got to spend.\n\n354\n00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.730\nThen let's take a look at\nthe service integrator.\n\n355\n00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.230\nAnd the service integrator role,\n\n356\n00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:53.510\nwell, we should have somebody who is\nin charge of the service integrator.\n\n357\n00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:57.977\nWe should have maybe a service delivery\nmanager or service managers and\n\n358\n00:19:57.977 --> 00:20:00.445\nwe should have process owners as well.\n\n359\n00:20:00.445 --> 00:20:06.958\nThat's somebody who takes accountability,\nnot responsibility but accountability for\n\n360\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:12.186\nthe individual processes including\nthe process managers that they take\n\n361\n00:20:12.186 --> 00:20:17.706\nthe responsibilities for managing\nthe processes on a day-to-day basis.\n\n362\n00:20:17.706 --> 00:20:24.840\nAnd so look at the responsibilities\nof a service integrator as a whole,\n\n363\n00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:30.630\nnot just one person, but\nlooking at the layer as whole,\n\n364\n00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:35.450\nthings like reporting for\ninstance and performance management.\n\n365\n00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:39.420\nAnd I love where it says,\nacting as the customer's agent,\n\n366\n00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:43.640\nensuring that we've got the right\ncommunication methods, and we're using\n\n367\n00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:48.089\nthe right communication language\nbetween all of our service providers.\n\n368\n00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.500\nAnd then you've got\nthe providers themselves.\n\n369\n00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.720\nAnd these are people that,\n\n370\n00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.950\nwell I expect to have account managers\nwithin each individual service provider.\n\n371\n00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:01.300\nYou may also have process managers\nwithin each service provider.\n\n372\n00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.080\nBe careful where it says process owner.\n\n373\n00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.760\nBut there maybe a process on a for\nthe service provider.\n\n374\n00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:12.710\nBut for your process in the SIAM\necosystem, the owner is within,\n\n375\n00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.220\nunless we gotta lead supplier situation,\nbut\n\n376\n00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:21.180\nother than that, the process\nowner with within the integrator.\n\n377\n00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:26.520\nBecause they have the accountability for\ndefining the process and\n\n378\n00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:31.170\ndefining what the process looks like and\ncertainly the improvement of the process.\n\n379\n00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.490\nAnd then we just got some\n\n380\n00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:39.430\nexamples here of some typical\nresponsibilities of the service provider.\n\n381\n00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.740\nUltimately, these are the people that\nare actually doing the development work.\n\n382\n00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.520\nThey're the people doing the support work.\n\n383\n00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:51.260\nOne of the responsibilities we mentioned\nthings like adhering to policies etc.\n\n384\n00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:55.229\nOne of the responsibilities\nof any service provider and\n\n385\n00:21:55.229 --> 00:21:58.950\nany role in any service\nprovider is collaboration.\n\n386\n00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:01.980\nAnd collaboration is key.\n\n387\n00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.580\nThe SIAM ecosystem is not\n\n388\n00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:10.820\ngoing to work without collaboration\nacross all our service provider roles.\n\n389\n00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.880\nAnd so if Justin decides that\nhe doesn't want to do his work,\n\n390\n00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:19.160\nit is not going to be down to another\nservice provider to pick up the slack.\n\n391\n00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.584\nIf Justin decides that he\ndoesn't wanna play ball,\n\n392\n00:22:21.584 --> 00:22:24.960\nthat he doesn't care what's in his\ncontract, he's not going to do it.\n\n393\n00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:30.360\nThen I, as a service integrator,\nit's my role to pick up the pieces and\n\n394\n00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.140\nto, I was just gonna say\ntake just into tasks, but\n\n395\n00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:40.345\nmaybe I'm gonna perform some sort of\nservice review, a performance review.\n\n396\n00:22:40.345 --> 00:22:46.135\nFirst of all, to find out exactly where\nwe can improve and what can be done about\n\n397\n00:22:46.135 --> 00:22:50.915\nthe fact that, well quite simply, Justin\ndoesn't want to talk to anybody else.\n\n398\n00:22:50.915 --> 00:22:53.165\n&gt;&gt; Well you know Jo, I can't help it.\n\n399\n00:22:53.165 --> 00:22:57.236\nI mean, you actually said something a\nlittle while ago where we're talking about\n\n400\n00:22:57.236 --> 00:23:01.680\nyou're going above and beyond your\ncontract or maybe it's not written down.\n\n401\n00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.370\nAnd these are the things that I've,\ngranted this is my baggage,\n\n402\n00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.030\nas you said, that I've been burnt by.\n\n403\n00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:11.980\nWhere you go above and beyond, and\nyou're setting unrealistic expectations\n\n404\n00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.350\nto where it becomes a normal expectation,\nright?\n\n405\n00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.580\nAnd then now the perception\nis if I stop doing that then\n\n406\n00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:20.590\nI'm not providing the value.\n\n407\n00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.600\nBut that's not what I was\nbrought on to provide value for.\n\n408\n00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.980\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; At the respective time.\n\n409\n00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.360\nSo I'm all about clarity.\n\n410\n00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:32.120\nWhether it's, we're outside of SIAM here,\nwhether it's like family or friend or\n\n411\n00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.300\nwhatever it may be,\nthey get all weirded out.\n\n412\n00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.000\nThey're like,\nwhat do you mean you want it in writing?\n\n413\n00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.700\nI was like I wanna make sure we have\nan appropriate, clarified set of\n\n414\n00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:45.530\nexpectations that we can all just\nkind of convene on and agree upon.\n\n415\n00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:46.960\nThat's why I would have an issue with,\n\n416\n00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.220\nlike, here's the things you're going to\ndo, because it's based on assumptions.\n\n417\n00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:51.940\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n418\n00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.550\nthose assumptions\nare based on perception of\n\n419\n00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:56.620\nsomething that you may not\nnecessarily know about.\n\n420\n00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.590\n&gt;&gt; What you were talking about there is\nwhat we'd call assumed responsibilities.\n\n421\n00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:03.525\nAn assumed responsibility is a\nresponsibility That you have assumed that\n\n422\n00:24:03.525 --> 00:24:08.200\nyou haven't actually signed up for, but\nit's something that you have assumed.\n\n423\n00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.570\nOn whether it's because I've\nassumed that you're doing it or\n\n424\n00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:13.620\nwhether because you're doing it\nout of the kindness of your heart.\n\n425\n00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.730\nIt's an assumed responsibility.\n\n426\n00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:19.390\nAnd you'll be surprised how\noften that actually happens and\n\n427\n00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:23.360\nthat a lot of service providers\nundertake assumed responsibilities\n\n428\n00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.310\nwithout even realizing\nthat they're doing that.\n\n429\n00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:32.170\nAnd it's only when those particular\nactivity stop that the customer and\n\n430\n00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:37.130\nthe service integrator, but\nmost notably the customer is actually,\n\n431\n00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:41.630\nis in a position where the service\nvalue has been degraded.\n\n432\n00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:45.150\nAnd sometimes it can take\nthe service integrated quite a while\n\n433\n00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.660\nto figure out why service\nhas been degraded.\n\n434\n00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:52.550\nAnd so that's really important from the\nservice integrator perspective as well,\n\n435\n00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.320\nis that any assumed\nresponsibilities are documented.\n\n436\n00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.440\nAnd it's not just about protecting\nyou as the service provider,\n\n437\n00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.260\nit's also about protecting the customer.\n\n438\n00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:04.330\nAnd so the service integrator\nneeds to ensure that we've got\n\n439\n00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.310\nall of those responsibilities documented.\n\n440\n00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:10.290\nSo we know what we're paying for and\nwe also know what we can expect.\n\n441\n00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:13.770\nSo we know what the level\nof service that we\n\n442\n00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.740\ncan assure the customer\nthat they are going to get.\n\n443\n00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.610\n&gt;&gt; And that makes perfect sense.\n\n444\n00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.570\nAnd I wanna make sure that I\nunderstand one part of this.\n\n445\n00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:25.150\nWe looked at those respective roles, but\nwe had the grand title for each layer.\n\n446\n00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:28.490\nWe had the customer organization,\nwe had the service integrator,\n\n447\n00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:31.090\nand then we had the service provider.\n\n448\n00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:34.750\nBut we could have multiple of\nthose roles and probably will be\n\n449\n00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:38.470\nwith the associated responsibilities\nat each one of those layers, correct?\n\n450\n00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:43.860\n&gt;&gt; Right, and we can't give you a\ndifinitive list of what roles are gong to\n\n451\n00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:49.210\nexist in every single layer\nof the Sayan ecosystem.\n\n452\n00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:53.490\nWhen we come back in our part two episode,\nwe're gonna look further at governance and\n\n453\n00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:57.870\nthe roles that the existing governments\nand the decisions that have to be made.\n\n454\n00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:02.455\nBut for you and\nyour organisations within that ecosystem.\n\n455\n00:26:02.455 --> 00:26:04.880\nI mean, we can use some examples there and\n\n456\n00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:09.480\nI'll give you some examples that\nI'd certainly be expecting you to\n\n457\n00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:14.250\ntake a look at certainly in\npreparation for your foundation test.\n\n458\n00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:17.600\nBut these are just there just to give\nyou a little bit of a prompt, so\n\n459\n00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.770\nthat when you are in a position\nwhere you're in a SIAM ecosystem and\n\n460\n00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:26.700\nyou are looking to implement and\nto evolve into that ecosystem.\n\n461\n00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.380\nAnd then,\nthese are just some considerations.\n\n462\n00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.010\nBut there is no definitive\nguide as to what roles and\n\n463\n00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.910\nresponsibilities you're going to have.\n\n464\n00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:38.020\nBecause quite simply, we don't know\nwhat your environment's gonna look like,\n\n465\n00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.710\nand every single environment is unique.\n\n466\n00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:43.120\n&gt;&gt; And well Jo,\nI think you've hit the nail on the head.\n\n467\n00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:47.220\nDecisions a lot of times are context\nspecific and while we've just started\n\n468\n00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.530\ndiving into roles and responsibilities,\nbut you said the G word, yes, governance.\n\n469\n00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:56.504\nAnd we're gonna have to come back for\na part two in order to.\n\n470\n00:26:56.504 --> 00:27:00.280\nIt could be a bad time, but we're gonna\nhave to come back to a part two to\n\n471\n00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:04.110\nactually give it its full time to explore.\n\n472\n00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:05.570\nSo definitely come back, but for\n\n473\n00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:07.100\nright now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n474\n00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.180\nSo signing off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n475\n00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.010\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n476\n00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:13.240\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n477\n00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:19.354\n[MUSIC]\n\n478\n00:27:19.354 --> 00:27:22.667\nThank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.423\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.423 --> 00:00:11.961\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:15.280\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and welcome to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.211\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\nwell, we're in part two for\n\n7\n00:00:19.211 --> 00:00:23.828\nroles and responsibilities which is\npart of our SIAM Foundation Course.\n\n8\n00:00:23.828 --> 00:00:28.100\nAnd well, you should definitely go watch\npart one because we gave an overview.\n\n9\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.780\nBut we're coming back to talk\na little more about governance.\n\n10\n00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.050\nAnd luckily we have someone who's gonna\ntell us all about it, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.150\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n\n12\n00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.410\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you,\nJustin, how are you?\n\n13\n00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.710\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic as well and\nI've heard the g word, governance.\n\n14\n00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.640\nI know there's a few other things but\nthat's what I kinda fixated on because\n\n15\n00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.330\nIt's both I think important, yet\nterrifying to me, personally.\n\n16\n00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.360\n&gt;&gt; Why are you frightened, Governor?\n\n17\n00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.690\nShould I ask or maybe I shouldn't ask.\n\n18\n00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.570\nMaybe it's just something\nI don't need to know.\n\n19\n00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.855\n&gt;&gt; It is probably something.\n\n20\n00:01:00.855 --> 00:01:02.853\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's just carry on, I guess.\n\n21\n00:01:02.853 --> 00:01:06.895\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, governance means,\n\n22\n00:01:06.895 --> 00:01:11.705\nwell, in ITIL terms we refer to governance\nas being controlled but with fairness and\n\n23\n00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:12.682\ntransparency.\n\n24\n00:01:12.682 --> 00:01:16.942\nDominants are all of the policies\nthat give us direction.\n\n25\n00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:22.542\nAs an IT service provider environment,\nas an IT service integrator,\n\n26\n00:01:22.542 --> 00:01:30.500\nwe have to decide on policies for\ngovernance, for direction, for strategies.\n\n27\n00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.666\nAnd so we have governance at\nabsolutely every single layer, and\n\n28\n00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:38.520\nwe'll see that we've got on\na diagram here in front of us.\n\n29\n00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.129\nWe have got our governance layers there,\nboth customer and service integrator,\n\n30\n00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:45.080\nand service provider layer.\n\n31\n00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.720\nAnd governance is said\nabout setting direction.\n\n32\n00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.780\nAnd so we've got governance that at our\ncustomer and our service integrator layer,\n\n33\n00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.750\nthey are set in the direction for\nour service providers.\n\n34\n00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.860\nSo they are directing.\n\n35\n00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.360\nThey're monitoring what our\nservice providers are doing.\n\n36\n00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.920\nThey're evaluating what our service\nproviders are doing, and then they\n\n37\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.700\nare directing, directing adjustments to\nthe way that our service providers work.\n\n38\n00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.300\nNow, from our service provider\nperspective, their governance is all about\n\n39\n00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.090\nplanning, building, running and\nmonitoring our services.\n\n40\n00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.330\nSo our service providers are managing.\n\n41\n00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.850\nBut they still have to have\npolicies to be able to do that.\n\n42\n00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.140\nAnd so this is what governance does.\n\n43\n00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.700\nAnd we have various governance boards\nthat will manage each individual layer.\n\n44\n00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.863\nSo let's take a look at examples.\n\n45\n00:02:41.863 --> 00:02:43.761\nAnd again, these are just examples,\n\n46\n00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:47.715\nvery similar to in our part one where we\nlooked at roles and responsibilities.\n\n47\n00:02:47.715 --> 00:02:49.555\nI gave you some examples.\n\n48\n00:02:49.555 --> 00:02:51.155\nAnd in this particular episode,\n\n49\n00:02:51.155 --> 00:02:53.545\nwe're gonna look at examples\nof governance roles.\n\n50\n00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:57.662\nAnd we're also going to look at a couple\nof things that are sort of common\n\n51\n00:02:57.662 --> 00:03:02.912\nactivities that happen\nwithin IT in general and\n\n52\n00:03:02.912 --> 00:03:07.322\nsomething that has to be considered\nacross all of our service providers.\n\n53\n00:03:07.322 --> 00:03:11.392\nSo first of all we're gonna take a look\nat our executive governance roles, and\n\n54\n00:03:11.392 --> 00:03:14.400\nour executive governance roles I expect\n\n55\n00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.120\nsort of steering groups to\nmeet on a quarterly basis.\n\n56\n00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.040\nI say quarterly, every three months,\nevery four months,\n\n57\n00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.850\nit could be, and I don't expect\na steering group to meet every week.\n\n58\n00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.150\nI don't expect a steering\ngroup to meet every month.\n\n59\n00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.270\nI expect them to meet at a frequent basis,\nbut nevertheless I expect them to meet\n\n60\n00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.218\nat an interval that is well,\nrealistic should we say?\n\n61\n00:03:43.218 --> 00:03:45.400\nThey're setting direction.\n\n62\n00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.090\nThink about how often we need to\nmake decisions on setting direction.\n\n63\n00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.170\nWe don't need to make decisions on\nsetting direction every single week.\n\n64\n00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.300\nIf your steering group within your\ngovernance model is meeting every single\n\n65\n00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.720\nweek or even every single month, and\nyou're operating on a tactical level and\n\n66\n00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.580\nperhaps you're getting too\ninvolved into the minutiae.\n\n67\n00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.700\nPerhaps you're getting too\ninvolved in the micromanaging.\n\n68\n00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.840\nYou're most definitely not\nat that governance level.\n\n69\n00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.710\nThis is something that I see quite often.\n\n70\n00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:25.930\nWhen I go into organizations in week\nbefore a maturity assessment, the steering\n\n71\n00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.500\ngroup that meets at a frequency that\nis way too great, every single week.\n\n72\n00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.570\nAnd what they're actually doing is they're\ndiscussing elements of the management of\n\n73\n00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.290\nthe ecosystem.\n\n74\n00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.260\nAnd these are elements that\nthey shouldn't be discussing.\n\n75\n00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.590\nThese are elements that\nmanagement should be discussing.\n\n76\n00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.090\nAnd so be very, very careful.\n\n77\n00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.010\nWe should always have an agenda and\n\n78\n00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.190\nhave a well let's just\nsay we should have some\n\n79\n00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.020\nform of vision for each steering group.\n\n80\n00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.380\nWe should understand what\nit is that that vision or\n\n81\n00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.200\nthat that steering group\nis there to achieve.\n\n82\n00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.040\nAnd we should stick to that vision, and\nif the steering group or the vision for\n\n83\n00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.130\nthe steering group Is just to very simply,\nwell,\n\n84\n00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.164\ndecide on direction, or to decide\non new endeavors, a new innovation,\n\n85\n00:05:21.164 --> 00:05:26.500\nand new services for\nour customer for the next six months.\n\n86\n00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.516\nWell, that's all the steering group\nshould be convened to discuss.\n\n87\n00:05:31.516 --> 00:05:34.270\nSo decide on the vision on the charter for\n\n88\n00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.890\nthat particular steering group or\nfor the board and stick to it.\n\n89\n00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:44.540\nIf you get into the individual management\nof certain operational factors,\n\n90\n00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.830\nit's no longer a steering a group,\nyou're not steering.\n\n91\n00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.000\nBut you're getting involved at\nthe tactical and at the management level.\n\n92\n00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.440\nAnd that we do have tactical groups,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n93\n00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.800\nBut the tactical board is something\nthat meets on a regular basis.\n\n94\n00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.908\nAnd the tactical board, well,\nthey're involved in the,\n\n95\n00:06:05.908 --> 00:06:08.881\nwell, the medium term planning.\n\n96\n00:06:08.881 --> 00:06:13.798\nThe steering group, the executive board,\nthey're looking forward in the long term,\n\n97\n00:06:13.798 --> 00:06:17.240\nwhereas tactical decisions\nare made in the short term.\n\n98\n00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.580\nThis is where we discuss\nimprovement initiatives.\n\n99\n00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.760\nThis is where we discuss changes\nto certain operating practices.\n\n100\n00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.500\nNote at the operational level, we're not\ndiscussing individual instances here of\n\n101\n00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.740\nmaybe process non adherence, for instance.\n\n102\n00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.560\nWe're not discussing individual breaches,\n\n103\n00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.820\nwhat we're discussing is potential\nimprovements to certain processes.\n\n104\n00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.620\nSo I expect my process owners to be here,\nI expect my account managers to be here.\n\n105\n00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.520\nDon't forget,\nthis is going to be across the board,\n\n106\n00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.600\nacross all of our service providers,\nthey're all going to attend this.\n\n107\n00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.310\nAnd then we have sort of our\noperational governance, and\n\n108\n00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.210\nour operational governance, again,\nI'd expect them to meet every month, and\n\n109\n00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.940\nthey're going to be discussing\nspecific issues with operation.\n\n110\n00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.230\nSo for instance, where service providers\nhaven't necessarily been talking to each\n\n111\n00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.920\nother, well that's what we'll be\ndiscussing in our operational boards.\n\n112\n00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.750\nNow I sense Justin's looking\na little bit perplexed here.\n\n113\n00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.390\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if it's perplexity.\n\n114\n00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.370\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's more, so\n\n115\n00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.550\nI wanna make sure I have this right.\n\n116\n00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.036\nSo we're kinda doing top-downs.\n\n117\n00:07:32.036 --> 00:07:36.040\nIt's for lack of a better phrase,\nit is a little cliche.\n\n118\n00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.840\nKind of a 10,000 foot view,\nlet's get to the forest level.\n\n119\n00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.010\nAnd operational is inspecting each and\n\n120\n00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.940\nevery tree to make sure it's\nholding up as we move back out.\n\n121\n00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.540\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Do I have that kind of squared away?\n\n122\n00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like to think of\nit in terms of longevity.\n\n123\n00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:57.119\nSo the executive board,\nthey're making decisions six months out.\n\n124\n00:07:57.119 --> 00:07:59.519\nSo they're looking six months in advance.\n\n125\n00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:03.614\nAnd the tactical board, I expect them\nto be looking sort of three months out,\n\n126\n00:08:03.614 --> 00:08:06.953\nwhereas my operational boards,\nmy operational governance,\n\n127\n00:08:06.953 --> 00:08:10.618\nI expect them to be looking in\nthe medium terms, or in the short term.\n\n128\n00:08:10.618 --> 00:08:15.320\nI expect them to be looking at changes\nin issues within the next month.\n\n129\n00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.718\nSo operational, we're talking about\na month in advance, tactical we're talking\n\n130\n00:08:20.718 --> 00:08:24.638\nabout three months, whereas strategic,\nI'm looking in the long-term.\n\n131\n00:08:24.638 --> 00:08:29.140\n&gt;&gt; But all the decisions for each of these\nvarious levels are meant to propagate.\n\n132\n00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.795\nSo the executive board\nis setting a vision.\n\n133\n00:08:32.795 --> 00:08:33.924\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n134\n00:08:33.924 --> 00:08:36.849\n&gt;&gt; The tactical board is setting, kind of,\n\n135\n00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:41.362\nI have a hardened word of explaining it,\nlike milestones that,\n\n136\n00:08:41.362 --> 00:08:45.961\nif these are met then the vision\nis being propagated forward, and\n\n137\n00:08:45.961 --> 00:08:50.977\nthen the operational board is making\nsure that we're moving forward,\n\n138\n00:08:50.977 --> 00:08:53.010\nhitting those milestones.\n\n139\n00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.790\nWould you say that's an appropriate,\nkind of, summation?\n\n140\n00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, that sounds good to me.\n\n141\n00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.620\nThe operational board are very much, they\nare concerned with the minutiae, whereas\n\n142\n00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.940\nthe executive board, I don't expect\nthem to be involved in the minutiae.\n\n143\n00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:12.290\nI don't expect the executive board\nto be discussing specific instances,\n\n144\n00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.570\nand specific occurrences,\nspecific events, but\n\n145\n00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.700\nI expect our operational board to\nbe doing that, yes, definitely so.\n\n146\n00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.158\nSo we have an example.\n\n147\n00:09:24.158 --> 00:09:28.699\nAnd again, all I can do is give you\nexamples, because without knowing your\n\n148\n00:09:28.699 --> 00:09:33.312\nspecific environment, it's very,\nvery difficult to say this is what each\n\n149\n00:09:33.312 --> 00:09:38.384\nparticular service provider should do, or\nthis is what the integrator should do.\n\n150\n00:09:38.384 --> 00:09:42.480\nWell, we've got some examples\nhere of some operational roles.\n\n151\n00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.910\nAnd the reason why I've given\n\n152\n00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:50.340\nyou these examples is because\nwith all of these forums, and\n\n153\n00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:57.240\nwith all of these boards these\nhave to be cross-service provider.\n\n154\n00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.150\nWhen we're talking about, say, planning\nfor capacity management, we plan for\n\n155\n00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.160\ncapacity across the board.\n\n156\n00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:10.230\nWhat we're interested in doing is\ndelivering a service to our customer.\n\n157\n00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.370\nThat's what we're doing, and\n\n158\n00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:16.490\nas a service integrator,\nI'm going to take charge of these roles.\n\n159\n00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.970\nIt is my responsibility as the service\nintegrator to deliver a valuable service\n\n160\n00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.110\nto the customer.\n\n161\n00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:26.474\nSo I have to make sure that all of my\nservice providers are involved and\n\n162\n00:10:26.474 --> 00:10:28.803\nthat all of my service\nproviders have an input.\n\n163\n00:10:28.803 --> 00:10:34.269\nWhich means that in all of these forums\nand these working groups, I expect\n\n164\n00:10:34.269 --> 00:10:40.200\nevery single one of my service providers\nto be represented, every single one.\n\n165\n00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.780\nBecause every single one of my\nservice providers are going to be,\n\n166\n00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:49.400\nwell essential in delivering\ncertain components of each service.\n\n167\n00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.050\nSo for instance, if we've got a service\nprovider that provides our network and\n\n168\n00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:58.470\nprovides our Internet, as well as our\nintranet, and our local area networks,\n\n169\n00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.940\nand our WANs, as well, then that service\nprovider needs to be on every single\n\n170\n00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:08.690\nboard, because every service is dependent\non our network, every single service.\n\n171\n00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:14.900\nSo we are going to have to ensure\nthat as a service provider or\n\n172\n00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.195\nas a service integrator,\n\n173\n00:11:16.195 --> 00:11:19.942\nwe're gonna have to ensure that all of\nour service providers are represented.\n\n174\n00:11:19.942 --> 00:11:24.540\nNow, [LAUGH] and\nI just wanna be realistic about this.\n\n175\n00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.960\nI'll guarantee nobody\nlikes to attend meetings.\n\n176\n00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:34.234\nService providers, especially when they're\nin different locations, how should\n\n177\n00:11:34.234 --> 00:11:39.051\nI say their willingness to attend these\nmeetings and these boards, varies.\n\n178\n00:11:39.051 --> 00:11:42.920\nBut the fact of the matter is, that if\nthey are performing an operational role,\n\n179\n00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.190\nthen as a service integrator\nthis is one of your challenges.\n\n180\n00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.790\nThe service integrator has\nto manage all of this.\n\n181\n00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:54.900\nAnd the service integrator has pull\nthese people together to ensure that we\n\n182\n00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:00.410\ncan discuss a way forward operationally\nand also to discuss what went wrong.\n\n183\n00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:04.460\nBecause there will be incidents,\nwe can't pretend that that doesn't happen.\n\n184\n00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:11.030\nSo we have to ensure these\nroles have to exist.\n\n185\n00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:14.430\nEvery single process has to have an owner.\n\n186\n00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.670\nAnd that owner is accountable.\n\n187\n00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:23.160\nAnd then every single process has to\nhave somebody who is responsible for\n\n188\n00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.530\nmanaging the process\non a day to day basis.\n\n189\n00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:31.350\nEvery single owner, every single service,\nhas to have an owner.\n\n190\n00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.760\nSomebody has to make\ndecisions on the services.\n\n191\n00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:42.296\nNow, services are made up of components,\nand processes support our services.\n\n192\n00:12:42.296 --> 00:12:46.223\nBut you don't have one incident\nmanagement process for,\n\n193\n00:12:46.223 --> 00:12:49.990\nsay your email service and\nanother incident process for\n\n194\n00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:55.300\nyour Excel service and another incident\nprocess for your financial service.\n\n195\n00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.349\nYou have one incident process that\nsupports every single service.\n\n196\n00:12:59.349 --> 00:13:02.814\nSo these process owners and\nthese service owners have\n\n197\n00:13:02.814 --> 00:13:07.434\nto work together to define not only\nwhat the services will deliver, and\n\n198\n00:13:07.434 --> 00:13:12.441\nall of their dependencies, but also to\ndefine each individual process, and\n\n199\n00:13:12.441 --> 00:13:17.755\nwhat each process will be able to deliver\ngiven the disparity of the components and\n\n200\n00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:22.420\nalso the service providers\nthat provide those components.\n\n201\n00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.920\nAnd then of course every single service\nhas to have a manager that manages\n\n202\n00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.330\nthe service on a day to day basis and\nmakes the daily decisions.\n\n203\n00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.305\nAnd I see Justin's desperate\nto say something right now.\n\n204\n00:13:34.305 --> 00:13:36.042\n-\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if I'm desperate.\n\n205\n00:13:36.042 --> 00:13:39.970\nI'm just trying to make sure I wrangle\nall of these pieces together, so\n\n206\n00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:43.700\nthe one question I have and\nI think this is based on my background, so\n\n207\n00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.060\nsome people may have this as well.\n\n208\n00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.770\nAn owner and a manager, they are not and\n\n209\n00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:51.790\nwe talked about the RACI matrices\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n210\n00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.215\n&gt;&gt; At length, because I got them wrong.\n\n211\n00:13:53.215 --> 00:13:54.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I couldn't remember them,\n\n212\n00:13:54.680 --> 00:14:00.290\nbut I'm seeing here we have the owner is\naccountable, the manager is responsible.\n\n213\n00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.830\nThose are not necessarily\nthe same individual or\n\n214\n00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:04.660\ngroups of individuals, correct?\n\n215\n00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.850\nOr excuse me, sorry, owner is accountable.\n\n216\n00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:08.620\nThat should be one.\n\n217\n00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.678\n&gt;&gt; One person, yeah.\n\n218\n00:14:09.678 --> 00:14:16.770\n&gt;&gt; Is it possible an owner and a manger\nare not necessarily the same person.\n\n219\n00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:18.920\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI\"m glad you use the word necessarily.\n\n220\n00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:25.270\nAn owner and a manager can be\nthe same person but not necessarily.\n\n221\n00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:29.100\nI like to use the word scalability\nwhen it comes to this.\n\n222\n00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.960\nThink about the scale, all right.\n\n223\n00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.980\nIn a service integration, if we're talking\nabout a small organization there's really,\n\n224\n00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.650\nreally possible that\nthe incident management\n\n225\n00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:42.410\nprocess owner is the same person that\nmanages the process on a day to day basis.\n\n226\n00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:46.350\nAnd they may even have also\naccountability for request management or\n\n227\n00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:47.800\nrequest fulfillment.\n\n228\n00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.880\nSo a process owner can own\nmore than one process and\n\n229\n00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.510\nthey can also be the process manager.\n\n230\n00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.963\nBut if you're talking about\na large scale global organization,\n\n231\n00:14:57.963 --> 00:15:02.557\nthen it's perfectly feasible that you have\na process owner for incident management.\n\n232\n00:15:02.557 --> 00:15:07.165\nBut then because the service desk is\nsplitting to shifts, then the incident\n\n233\n00:15:07.165 --> 00:15:11.989\nmanagers, the process managers, you might\nhave three or four depending on how\n\n234\n00:15:11.989 --> 00:15:17.100\nmany shifts you've got and\nhow many locations completely scalable.\n\n235\n00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.080\nYou don't look convinced.\n\n236\n00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.630\n&gt;&gt; No, I do.\n\n237\n00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:24.500\nI'm trying to think that make sense\nbecause essentially a process owner for\n\n238\n00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.270\naccountable like these things\nare going to happen or\n\n239\n00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.505\nthis service is going to be available.\n\n240\n00:15:30.505 --> 00:15:32.940\n&gt;&gt; Or this is what the process\nis going to look like, yes.\n\n241\n00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:37.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then the manager could be\na delegated individual that could shift\n\n242\n00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:41.210\nbased on requiring either\na geographic requirements or\n\n243\n00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.860\ndisparities or a time shift or\nthings like that.\n\n244\n00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.860\nWould that be an appropriate assertion?\n\n245\n00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:53.412\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but the manager shouldn't\nbe shifting on a on a regular basis.\n\n246\n00:15:53.412 --> 00:15:56.544\nSo we shouldn't have,\nwhen you say shifting, yes,\n\n247\n00:15:56.544 --> 00:16:00.162\nwe should have maybe a set of\nthree of four incident managers,\n\n248\n00:16:00.162 --> 00:16:03.872\nbecause they're the shift leaders for\nincident management.\n\n249\n00:16:03.872 --> 00:16:07.756\nBut when we say shifted, I don't mean\nwe'll have one person one week and\n\n250\n00:16:07.756 --> 00:16:11.452\nthen somebody else the next week and\nsomebody else the next week, and\n\n251\n00:16:11.452 --> 00:16:13.900\nsomebody else the next week, ad infinitum.\n\n252\n00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.978\nThat's not what we're talking about, no.\n\n253\n00:16:15.978 --> 00:16:18.090\nCuz then there'll be\nno consistency at all.\n\n254\n00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.730\n&gt;&gt; And that's not what I mean.\n\n255\n00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:26.510\nA manager could be a set of managers\nthat shared that responsibility\n\n256\n00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:30.830\nbased on kind of business requirement,\nlike we operate 24 hours a day.\n\n257\n00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.750\nWell, one individual cannot be-\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n258\n00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.480\n&gt;&gt; There for 24 hours a day.\n\n259\n00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.350\nIf we work 2 12-hour shifts,\nthere are now a group of 2 managers\n\n260\n00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.445\nthat share that responsibility for\nthat respective process.\n\n261\n00:16:42.445 --> 00:16:47.813\n&gt;&gt; Well, while we're looking at this,\nI wanna think about the service desk.\n\n262\n00:16:47.813 --> 00:16:50.550\nRight, because we're talking\nabout incident management.\n\n263\n00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:55.170\nAnd the service desk could be\nprovided by absolutely anybody.\n\n264\n00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:58.980\nIt could be provided by the customer\norganizations, so it could be internal.\n\n265\n00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:03.345\nOr it could be external or internal\nif it's provided by the integrator.\n\n266\n00:17:03.345 --> 00:17:07.535\nOr it could be provided by yet\nanother service provider.\n\n267\n00:17:07.535 --> 00:17:11.597\nAnd that's quite often what\nwe do in a SIAM ecosystem,\n\n268\n00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:15.455\nis that quite frequently we\nfind the service desk is yet\n\n269\n00:17:15.455 --> 00:17:20.055\nanother service provider because\nit's outsourced as a service desk.\n\n270\n00:17:20.055 --> 00:17:25.430\nBut nevertheless,\nwe still have to have a clear ownership.\n\n271\n00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:29.070\nSo even though the service\ndesk has a tool set,\n\n272\n00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.780\nsomebody has to own incident management.\n\n273\n00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:36.340\nBecause you see when the service desk\nraise an incident, then what will\n\n274\n00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.130\nhappen is that that incident will be\npassed on then to second -evel support,\n\n275\n00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.080\nwhich may be one service provider.\n\n276\n00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.290\nAnd then maybe to third-level support,\nwhich may be another service provider or\n\n277\n00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.470\nanother three or four service providers.\n\n278\n00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:50.030\nAnd so\nwe have to have the same tool set for\n\n279\n00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:53.470\nthat incident to be passed\naround amongst all of them.\n\n280\n00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.000\nAnd where you've got different service\nproviders with their own tool sets,\n\n281\n00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.430\nthen we get into what we discussed\nin one of our previous episode,\n\n282\n00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:06.420\nwhich was a lot of translation that\nhappens between all of the tool sets.\n\n283\n00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:11.570\nAnd it doesn't deliver a very\ngood value to the customer.\n\n284\n00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.173\nAnd this is why,\ngoing back to that process owner role,\n\n285\n00:18:15.173 --> 00:18:17.635\nthe process owner has to define that.\n\n286\n00:18:17.635 --> 00:18:20.341\nBut they don't just define the process,\n\n287\n00:18:20.341 --> 00:18:24.222\nthey also define the tools that\nare going to be used as well.\n\n288\n00:18:24.222 --> 00:18:25.119\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n\n289\n00:18:25.119 --> 00:18:27.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is a little mind bending for me,\n\n290\n00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.829\nbecause I just thought of something\nwhile we're talking about this.\n\n291\n00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.751\nWe could have a process\nthat has an owner and\n\n292\n00:18:34.751 --> 00:18:39.879\nmanagers that are in fact not\ninternal to the company per se.\n\n293\n00:18:39.879 --> 00:18:43.111\nThey are part of an external\nservice provider, but\n\n294\n00:18:43.111 --> 00:18:45.900\nthey still have to\nadhere to our processes.\n\n295\n00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.780\nAnd someone has to take accountability for\nthat process.\n\n296\n00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.380\nAnd someone has to keep responsibility for\n\n297\n00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:57.880\nthat process actually being completed or\nutilized.\n\n298\n00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.815\nBut they're not necessarily\ninternal to our company.\n\n299\n00:18:59.815 --> 00:19:03.479\nWould that be the service integrator's\nresponsibility to make sure that those\n\n300\n00:19:03.479 --> 00:19:04.360\nare passed along?\n\n301\n00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.878\nOr am I overcomplicating this?\n\n302\n00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:08.000\n&gt;&gt; Right, no, you're not.\n\n303\n00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.100\nThese are the genuine questions that get\nasked quite often in this ecosystem.\n\n304\n00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.844\nAnd let's be realistic about this, okay.\n\n305\n00:19:15.844 --> 00:19:19.250\nFor the most part,\nwhat tends to work really well\n\n306\n00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:24.020\nis where a process owner sits either\nwithin the customer environment,\n\n307\n00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.340\nin the customer layer, or whether they\nsit in the service integrator layer.\n\n308\n00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.920\nHaving owners that sit,\nprocess owners that sit,\n\n309\n00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:37.655\nin each individual service provider layer,\nit's possible.\n\n310\n00:19:37.655 --> 00:19:41.010\nIt's not impossible, but\nit's very difficult to manage.\n\n311\n00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.990\nSo what we would tend to do, bearing in\nmind that the service integrator layer is\n\n312\n00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:49.852\nthat layer that manages each\nindividual service provider,\n\n313\n00:19:49.852 --> 00:19:55.940\nit is usual for the process owner role\nto sit in the service integrator layer.\n\n314\n00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.886\nThat's where it is usual.\n\n315\n00:19:58.886 --> 00:20:01.400\nIt can sit in the customer layer.\n\n316\n00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:06.540\nBut I don't expect the customer to know,\nin any technical detail,\n\n317\n00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.919\nanything about the services and\nthe components of those services.\n\n318\n00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:16.270\nSo if we've got a customer that is\nacting as a process owner for one or\n\n319\n00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:19.180\nmore processes,\nit's to say I don't expect them\n\n320\n00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.330\nto know enough about the processes\nto be able to do that.\n\n321\n00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:28.210\nSo it is more usual for the process owner\nto sit in the service integrator layer.\n\n322\n00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:32.460\n&gt;&gt; And that actually makes a little\nmore sense, I can reason about that.\n\n323\n00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:37.620\nIf it's in the customer layer, who would\nbe the process manager at that capacity?\n\n324\n00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.170\nWould they have to have now direct contact\n\n325\n00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.530\nwith wherever the process\nis being executed?\n\n326\n00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.520\nOr would-\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n327\n00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.050\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Well, they would, and\n\n328\n00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.080\nthat's what would make it difficult.\n\n329\n00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.480\nBecause you see,\nthen you kind of duplicate an effort and\n\n330\n00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.750\nthat's not efficient.\n\n331\n00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:56.480\nBecause the service integrator is\nthe person that manages on a daily basis.\n\n332\n00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.990\nSo they would potentially\nbe this process manager.\n\n333\n00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.444\nBut then within each\nindividual service provider,\n\n334\n00:21:02.444 --> 00:21:05.199\nyou're also going to have managers too.\n\n335\n00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:11.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI don't like the way this feels, Jo.\n\n336\n00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:15.200\nIf you have the process owner and\n\n337\n00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.730\nthe customer, it just seems like\nthere's way too much far removal.\n\n338\n00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.500\nWell, it becomes the game of telephone.\n\n339\n00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.770\nI need you to blah blah blah, and then\nthey tell them, and they tell them, and\n\n340\n00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.390\nthen nothing gets done.\n\n341\n00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:31.600\nBut then the accountable person is on\nthe hook for that thing not getting done.\n\n342\n00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.371\nBut there's things being removed, right?\n\n343\n00:21:33.371 --> 00:21:34.620\n&gt;&gt; Keep it simple.\n\n344\n00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.000\nWe like to keep it simple.\n\n345\n00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.900\nIn a SIAM ecosystem, and\n\n346\n00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.850\nfor the sake of efficiency as well,\nwe wanna keep it simple.\n\n347\n00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.050\nAs simple as we possibly can.\n\n348\n00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:48.870\nAnd so that's something that we've\ngot to bring into the roles and\n\n349\n00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:52.560\nresponsibilities and into our people's\nstructure, is that we've got to\n\n350\n00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.650\nthink about simplicity,\nwe don't want to overcomplicate things.\n\n351\n00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.980\nBut [LAUGH], and I've got to say this,\n\n352\n00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:04.500\nthe look of confusion on your face right\nnow is unfortunately a look of confusion\n\n353\n00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.590\nthat appears on a lot of people's\nfaces when we're in this environment.\n\n354\n00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:13.240\nIt's how on earth do we work out what\nour roles and responsibilities are, and\n\n355\n00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.640\ndo we work out who is going to do what?\n\n356\n00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.050\nAnd that is something that\nwe've got to work out.\n\n357\n00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:24.160\nYou can't just leave it and hope for\nthe best and just think, well,\n\n358\n00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.930\nthat's okay, our service providers\nare going to assume responsibilities,\n\n359\n00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.080\nwe looked at that in a previous episode,\nand our service provider's\n\n360\n00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.360\ngonna assume responsibilities and\neverything's gonna work okay.\n\n361\n00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.620\nCuz it doesn't work like that.\n\n362\n00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.831\n&gt;&gt; Personally, I think that's\nan unreasonable expectation,\n\n363\n00:22:40.831 --> 00:22:42.433\ncuz then everybody gets let down.\n\n364\n00:22:42.433 --> 00:22:47.090\nBoth sides are not meeting where\nthey anticipate they're gonna meet.\n\n365\n00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:48.180\nI assumed you were gonna do this.\n\n366\n00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.980\nWell, I assumed that you would\ntell me if I needed to do that.\n\n367\n00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:57.614\nAnd I think the look,\nthough it may be confusing also,\n\n368\n00:22:57.614 --> 00:23:01.302\nis more of these are hard problems.\n\n369\n00:23:01.302 --> 00:23:03.866\nSo my mind's kinda churning away going,\nall right, so\n\n370\n00:23:03.866 --> 00:23:06.120\nwhat would make sense in this case?\n\n371\n00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.180\nA little bit of thought of experiments.\n\n372\n00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:12.790\nAnd as we've said before, there are not\nnecessarily easy or always right answers.\n\n373\n00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:14.094\nIt always ends up being\nvery context specific.\n\n374\n00:23:14.094 --> 00:23:19.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there's a right answer for\neach individual environment.\n\n375\n00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:24.190\nIt is context specific,\nthere is not a right generic answer.\n\n376\n00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:29.200\nAnd the right generic answer is simply\nto assign roles and responsibilities.\n\n377\n00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.030\nThat's the only right generic answer.\n\n378\n00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:35.360\nThere is no other generic\nanswer that's going to fit.\n\n379\n00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.700\nThis is not a one-size-fits-all approach,\nand\n\n380\n00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.130\nyou cannot implement\na one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n381\n00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:46.210\nIf you try and take the SIAM book and\nyou try and implement that in a plug and\n\n382\n00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.920\nplay fashion, then there's part of me\nthat wants to say, well, good luck.\n\n383\n00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.280\nLet me know when you're doing that\ncuz I want to come and watch.\n\n384\n00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.215\nBecause it's not going to happen.\n\n385\n00:23:54.215 --> 00:24:00.232\nEven though we tell you in the books\nthis is what you need to consider,\n\n386\n00:24:00.232 --> 00:24:07.000\nthere's not enough of an element of\nplug and plug for it to work for you.\n\n387\n00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.010\nYou have to consider and you have to plan.\n\n388\n00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.160\nThe efficiency and\n\n389\n00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:17.575\nthe effectiveness of the SIAM ecosystem\nis entirely, and I mean entirely,\n\n390\n00:24:17.575 --> 00:24:23.090\ndependant on the configuration and\nthe organization that you put into this.\n\n391\n00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:28.410\nIf you do not configure your roles and\nresponsibilities, and you do not have\n\n392\n00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:33.630\na road map for the implementation and for\nthe responsibilities across the service\n\n393\n00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:38.110\nproviders and for all of the processes,\nthen it simply isn't going to work.\n\n394\n00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:40.350\nAnd what you're going to\nend up with is chaos.\n\n395\n00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.468\nAnd instead of delivering value,\n\n396\n00:24:42.468 --> 00:24:46.492\nyou're actually going to remove\nvalue from service provision.\n\n397\n00:24:46.492 --> 00:24:50.367\nBut this is where a lot of organizations\nfind themselves, because they've evolved\n\n398\n00:24:50.367 --> 00:24:53.752\nto a position where they've got lots\nof individual service providers and\n\n399\n00:24:53.752 --> 00:24:58.280\nthey're simply not talking to each other\nor they're not working collaboratively.\n\n400\n00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.330\nAnd they're in that chaos now.\n\n401\n00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:04.410\nWhich is why everything that we've talked\nabout in all of our episodes up until now\n\n402\n00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:10.060\ninvolves planning and it involves working\nout what those relationships look like.\n\n403\n00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:13.590\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jo, planning is hard and and\npeople don't necessarily like doing it.\n\n404\n00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:17.360\nBut it does have a large scale implication\n\n405\n00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.760\nabout how successful\nsomething's going to be, right?\n\n406\n00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.240\nYou go, we'll just figure it out, right?\n\n407\n00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.890\nAnd then six months down the road you go,\nso\n\n408\n00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:30.090\nlisten, things are going a bunch of\nsideways and then I don't know what to do.\n\n409\n00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.960\nJo, we've talked a lot about roles and\nresponsibilities.\n\n410\n00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:38.520\nAnd just when I think I'm starting to wrap\nmy mind around all of the things I need to\n\n411\n00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.200\nconsider, you add a little bit more.\n\n412\n00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:47.770\nIs this a good place to kinda say, okay,\nwe can leave this be for now and move on?\n\n413\n00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:49.210\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n414\n00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:52.120\nNow that we've discussed the roles and\nresponsibilities,\n\n415\n00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:57.270\nwhen we come back in our subsequent\nepisodes, we're going to take a delve into\n\n416\n00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:01.560\nthe processes that we need to\nmanage within the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n417\n00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.650\nAnd we're going to have quite a few\nepisodes, it's almost like an entire\n\n418\n00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:08.640\nseries all on its own,\nwhere we look at all of those processes.\n\n419\n00:26:09.706 --> 00:26:12.824\n&gt;&gt; Processes,\nthe things that we think we know, and\n\n420\n00:26:12.824

00:00:08.259\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:12.602\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:15.122\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:19.260\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and we're\ncontinuing on with our sign foundation.\n\n7\n00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.063\nAnd well we are gonna\ndive in sign processes.\n\n8\n00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:25.855\nI think we're gonna get a general\noverview in this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:29.602\nAnd well the one that is gonna tell\nus all about it, Ms. Joe Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:31.772\nHow do you doing, Joe?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great.\n\n11\n00:00:31.772 --> 00:00:34.724\nThank you, Justine, how are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic but\n\n12\n00:00:34.724 --> 00:00:38.843\nthe sign in processes,\nwe were talking before the show and\n\n13\n00:00:38.843 --> 00:00:44.410\nI felt there were only a few but, when in\nfact there are a whole great plethora.\n\n14\n00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.175\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:45.175 --> 00:00:46.467\n&gt;&gt; Just a cornicopia of processes that\n\n16\n00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:48.895\nwe need to go through, am I right?\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yes.\n\n17\n00:00:48.895 --> 00:00:53.472\nSo this isn't going to be so\nmuch of a mini-series as a complete, well,\n\n18\n00:00:53.472 --> 00:00:56.787\nif you were reading this in a book,\nit'll be a tone.\n\n19\n00:00:56.787 --> 00:01:01.186\nBut no, it's not gonna be that bad cuz now\nit sounds as though it's gonna be painful,\n\n20\n00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:03.463\nand it's not actually going to be painful.\n\n21\n00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:08.345\nWhat we're gonna do is, in this particular\nepisode, we're going to look at a process.\n\n22\n00:01:08.345 --> 00:01:11.344\nAnd look what a process is,\nwhat a process does.\n\n23\n00:01:11.344 --> 00:01:15.945\nAnd what a process needs to have in place\nin order for it to be able to function and\n\n24\n00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:18.474\nfor it to be able to meet it's objectives.\n\n25\n00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:22.545\nAnd then we're going to look at\nthe process that we have within the SIAM\n\n26\n00:01:22.545 --> 00:01:23.313\necosystem.\n\n27\n00:01:23.313 --> 00:01:27.380\nAnd then in our subsequent episodes\nwe're going to be looking at individual\n\n28\n00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.331\nprocesses themselves and looking at\nthe objectives of those processes.\n\n29\n00:01:31.331 --> 00:01:35.956\nSo my first question to you Justin,\nsee cuz we always have to start\n\n30\n00:01:35.956 --> 00:01:40.344\noff with a question to Justin;\nwhat do you think a process is?\n\n31\n00:01:40.344 --> 00:01:43.839\n&gt;&gt; I think it's a clearly defined set of\n\n32\n00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:48.687\nsteps or actions to take for\na particular goal, and\n\n33\n00:01:48.687 --> 00:01:53.602\nthat's gonna be my answer.\n&gt;&gt; You're actually really close\n\n34\n00:01:53.602 --> 00:01:57.811\nto the truth, Justin,\nI'm impressed, very impressed.\n\n35\n00:01:57.811 --> 00:02:01.560\nI've been told, by the way, I've gotta\ngive him his credit where credit is due.\n\n36\n00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.353\nSo I'm gonna make sure that we do that.\n\n37\n00:02:03.353 --> 00:02:06.738\n[LAUGH] A process is\na structured set of activities,\n\n38\n00:02:06.738 --> 00:02:09.664\nit's something that has to be documented.\n\n39\n00:02:09.664 --> 00:02:15.491\nIt's something that you do and it's\ndesigned to achieve a specific objective.\n\n40\n00:02:15.491 --> 00:02:20.468\nNow, I wanna just draw your attention to\nyour downloadable material in a slide here\n\n41\n00:02:20.468 --> 00:02:24.894\nwhere in a lot of slides that we've\ngot coming up in subsequent episodes.\n\n42\n00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:29.644\nWe will see a term is highlighted\nin blue at the top of\n\n43\n00:02:29.644 --> 00:02:35.056\nthe screen a process,\nin terms of SIAM, is a documented,\n\n44\n00:02:35.056 --> 00:02:41.589\nrepeatable approach to carrying out\na series of tasks or activities.\n\n45\n00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:48.096\nSo, let's talk about some of\nthe characteristics then of a process.\n\n46\n00:02:48.096 --> 00:02:53.710\nWell, a process as it already\nsays there has to be repeatable.\n\n47\n00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.577\nIf it's not documented then\nit can't be repeatable.\n\n48\n00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:02.419\nYou've got to write it down in order\nto be able to do it over and over and\n\n49\n00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:03.161\nover again.\n\n50\n00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:06.739\nWe've got to make sure that we\nhave consistency in our processes.\n\n51\n00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.168\nSo therefore yeah, we should really be\ndocumenting that to have that consistency.\n\n52\n00:03:11.168 --> 00:03:14.553\nNow I also want to bring into\nconsideration the fact that of\n\n53\n00:03:14.553 --> 00:03:18.993\ncourse our processes have to be carried\nout by multiple service providers.\n\n54\n00:03:18.993 --> 00:03:22.465\nSo therefore when we document those\nprocesses we also have to think\n\n55\n00:03:22.465 --> 00:03:25.319\nabout the audience that\nwe're documenting them for.\n\n56\n00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.282\nAnd of course we know that any form of\ndocumentation, any form of communication\n\n57\n00:03:30.282 --> 00:03:34.315\nhas to be in, what language Justin?\n&gt;&gt; The language of the audience.\n\n58\n00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:35.985\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, there we go.\n\n59\n00:03:35.985 --> 00:03:38.110\nYou were looking a little\nbit perplexed though.\n\n60\n00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.586\n&gt;&gt; It's not perplexed, I was like okay,\n\n61\n00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:42.396\nrepeatable, documented.\n\n62\n00:03:42.396 --> 00:03:45.939\nI think when I've suggested\nthis in previous roles,\n\n63\n00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.100\nnot necessarily in the case\nof cyan processes.\n\n64\n00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.100\nBut hey, we should document this,\nI've been met with resistance of well,\n\n65\n00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.235\nwe don't have time.\n\n66\n00:03:54.235 --> 00:03:59.279\nWe don't have the ability to write\nall this detailed documentation but\n\n67\n00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:01.557\nfor me, I see it as long-term.\n\n68\n00:04:01.557 --> 00:04:06.357\nIf we can't reproduce this, we don't have\nany way of saying these are the steps\n\n69\n00:04:06.357 --> 00:04:10.816\nthat we took in order to complete X, Y,\nand Z then we go down a rabbit hole.\n\n70\n00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:16.680\nWhich my question stems from, does the\ndocumentation have to be small novellas?\n\n71\n00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.421\nOr can they be kind of broad outlines\nif your audience has the capability\n\n72\n00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:27.081\nof kind of filling in the blanks?\n&gt;&gt; We like to keep it simple approach.\n\n73\n00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:28.944\nAnd when it comes to IT,\n\n74\n00:04:28.944 --> 00:04:33.430\nI think we have already gone\ndown into a rabbit hole in IT.\n\n75\n00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.001\nAnd certainly, over the last few years\nthere seems to have been a move.\n\n76\n00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:43.763\nWell, I say the last few years, but over\nthe evolution of IT there has definitely\n\n77\n00:04:43.763 --> 00:04:47.354\nbeen a move to try and\nincrease the amount of documentation.\n\n78\n00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:52.734\nAnd the theory that all well, the more\nwe have than the better quality it is.\n\n79\n00:04:52.734 --> 00:04:56.526\nWell, absolutely not and so\nwith the latest evolution,\n\n80\n00:04:56.526 --> 00:04:58.424\nwhen we look at say, Agile.\n\n81\n00:04:58.424 --> 00:05:01.653\nAnd we look at lean and we look at IT,\n\n82\n00:05:01.653 --> 00:05:06.512\neven we look at SIAM now,\nthat's not the case at all.\n\n83\n00:05:06.512 --> 00:05:09.857\nWhat we actually want is the minimal\namount of documentation.\n\n84\n00:05:09.857 --> 00:05:14.299\nWell, I say minimal, okay, we want to\nhave documentation that's relevant.\n\n85\n00:05:14.299 --> 00:05:18.502\nWe want to have documentation that\nsays exactly what it needs to say.\n\n86\n00:05:18.502 --> 00:05:24.053\nBut you don't need all of the well,\nI mean you mentioned the word no velour.\n\n87\n00:05:24.053 --> 00:05:27.577\nYou don't need all of those excess words,\nkeep it simple.\n\n88\n00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:31.087\nWe like to keep a simple approach,\nand we also like the agile approach\n\n89\n00:05:31.087 --> 00:05:34.732\nthe documentation as well and\nthe lean approach, which is less waste.\n\n90\n00:05:34.732 --> 00:05:37.476\nYou don't want too much\nwastes in document.\n\n91\n00:05:37.476 --> 00:05:42.218\nThen certainly when you're documenting the\nprocess you have to bear in mind that any\n\n92\n00:05:42.218 --> 00:05:46.511\nprocess and we'll take, for example,\nthe incident management process.\n\n93\n00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:49.786\nIt has to be undertaken by\nevery single service provider.\n\n94\n00:05:49.786 --> 00:05:54.683\nIt has to be specific enough to allow for\nconsistency because many people\n\n95\n00:05:54.683 --> 00:05:58.790\nhave got to follow that process over and\nover and over again.\n\n96\n00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.528\nBut ambiguous enough to allow for\nconsistency as well,\n\n97\n00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:04.626\nbecause everybody's gonna do it\nin a slightly different way.\n\n98\n00:06:04.626 --> 00:06:08.998\nSo yes,\nwe do need to have it documented, but\n\n99\n00:06:08.998 --> 00:06:13.947\nwe've got to document it\nin a way that makes sense,\n\n100\n00:06:13.947 --> 00:06:17.531\nit can't be too over-engineered.\n\n101\n00:06:17.531 --> 00:06:21.293\nIf you over-engineer your documentation\nand you over-engineer your process,\n\n102\n00:06:21.293 --> 00:06:22.774\nyou know what's gonna happen?\n\n103\n00:06:22.774 --> 00:06:24.953\nPeople are gonna bypass it.\n\n104\n00:06:24.953 --> 00:06:30.771\nChange management is the most bypassed\nprocess in the whole of IT, why?\n\n105\n00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:34.327\nWell, because generally people perceive\nit as having too much red tape.\n\n106\n00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:37.865\nAnd it's really because it's\nbeen over-engineered, or\n\n107\n00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:39.782\nit's been over-documented.\n\n108\n00:06:39.782 --> 00:06:44.147\nNobody wants to pick up a book and read it\nfrom cover to cover just to find out how\n\n109\n00:06:44.147 --> 00:06:47.452\nto raise a change request,\nthey're not going to do that.\n\n110\n00:06:47.452 --> 00:06:51.553\nSuppose this documentation needs\nto actually reflect the process.\n\n111\n00:06:51.553 --> 00:06:56.601\nThe process should also be as lean\nas it possibly can be as well,\n\n112\n00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:58.424\nit needs to be simple.\n\n113\n00:06:58.424 --> 00:07:03.293\nI sense you're thinking something.\n&gt;&gt; I'm just trying to think,\n\n114\n00:07:03.293 --> 00:07:05.641\nand this makes sense from,\n\n115\n00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:09.458\nI take myself as a user of the process.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n116\n00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:10.013\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n117\n00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:15.724\nthen I don't need 97 steps to accomplish\nsomething cuz that level of detail kinda,\n\n118\n00:07:15.724 --> 00:07:17.802\nit puts me off, like you said.\n\n119\n00:07:17.802 --> 00:07:20.163\nI just go, I'll figure it out.\n\n120\n00:07:20.163 --> 00:07:24.483\nI'll ad hoc kinda, I'll figure it out.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what happens.\n\n121\n00:07:24.483 --> 00:07:26.125\n&gt;&gt; At the same time, I need some guidance.\n\n122\n00:07:26.125 --> 00:07:29.653\nSo I'm almost thinking,\nwhen you said minimal,\n\n123\n00:07:29.653 --> 00:07:34.609\nI'm thinking minimal that helps\ntransmit the knowledge necessary to\n\n124\n00:07:34.609 --> 00:07:38.390\nactually implement the process\nin a repeatable way.\n\n125\n00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.837\nDon't get too overboard with it, but there\nshould be enough there to where I can go,\n\n126\n00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:45.170\nokay, I know I need to\ndo these five things.\n\n127\n00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.593\nThere's a really broad, but\nthose are kinda the core ideas.\n\n128\n00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:51.741\nAnd do I have that kinda nailed down?\n&gt;&gt; You do, yeah.\n\n129\n00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:57.523\nWe, I mean we've got a lot more on\nprocesses when we look in our ITLC for\n\n130\n00:07:57.523 --> 00:07:58.503\ninstance.\n\n131\n00:07:58.503 --> 00:08:01.817\nThere's a huge amount on processes and\nprocess definition but\n\n132\n00:08:01.817 --> 00:08:04.078\nwe always want to think about efficiency.\n\n133\n00:08:04.078 --> 00:08:05.904\nAnd so, you don't want to have,\n\n134\n00:08:05.904 --> 00:08:09.320\nif you have too many steps in\nthe process it's not efficient.\n\n135\n00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.930\nRemember efficiency is about\nminimal waste, again, and\n\n136\n00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:17.500\nit's about minimal waste in terms of time,\nin terms of skill, in terms of money too.\n\n137\n00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.000\nSo we want to be able to\nfollow every single step, but\n\n138\n00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.620\nwe want to be able to follow\nevery single step efficiently.\n\n139\n00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.360\nWhich might mean that, and\nwe're gonna get on to another topic here,\n\n140\n00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.370\nand we might as well cover this now.\n\n141\n00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:37.300\nThis may mean that we will have\nspecific types of process models\n\n142\n00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.820\nin order to be able to\nachieve certain outcomes.\n\n143\n00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.770\nA process is a set of activities designed\nto achieve certain outcomes, and\n\n144\n00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.680\nwe wanna make sure that it is efficient\nas it possibly can be, and that it's\n\n145\n00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.210\nunderstood by absolutely everybody\nthat's gonna be following the process.\n\n146\n00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.354\nEverybody feels the same way that you do,\nJustin.\n\n147\n00:08:56.354 --> 00:09:00.723\nEverybody does, I do, I am, I will admit.\n\n148\n00:09:00.723 --> 00:09:05.214\nIf I see an inefficient process, given\nthat I spend maybe the majority of my time\n\n149\n00:09:05.214 --> 00:09:10.042\ntalking about efficiencies and processes,\nwhenever I see an inefficient process,\n\n150\n00:09:10.042 --> 00:09:12.873\nthen this doesn't necessarily\njust apply to IT.\n\n151\n00:09:12.873 --> 00:09:17.192\nI will be the first one to say this does\nnot work for me, this is not efficient,\n\n152\n00:09:17.192 --> 00:09:20.251\nand therefore,\nI don't want to follow this process,\n\n153\n00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:22.820\nbecause it doesn't make any sense.\n\n154\n00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:27.910\nAnd so, I'm saying this,\nand I understand processes.\n\n155\n00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.980\nSo of course,\nyou're going to say this, and\n\n156\n00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.820\nanybody else in IT is gonna\nsay exactly the same.\n\n157\n00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.250\nIf there's too much red tape,\nI'm not gonna follow it.\n\n158\n00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:40.470\nSo what we like to do is we like to\nimplement something called process models,\n\n159\n00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.900\non process models are what we\ncall predefined sets of steps.\n\n160\n00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.990\nSo having standard ways of\ndoing certain things, and\n\n161\n00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:53.530\nwe allow our tools to help us or\nrather to facilitate that.\n\n162\n00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:58.977\nSo rather than every time somebody calls\nthe service desk, we take their name,\n\n163\n00:09:58.977 --> 00:10:03.547\nand we take their telephone number,\nand we take their locations.\n\n164\n00:10:03.547 --> 00:10:07.437\nAnd we take note of what hardware\nthey're using and what software\n\n165\n00:10:07.437 --> 00:10:12.870\nthey're using on that particular laptop,\nand we take note of everything else.\n\n166\n00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.390\nRather than do that,\nthen the first time they called, sure,\n\n167\n00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.500\nwe might take that detail from them.\n\n168\n00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.163\nBut the second time we call that detail\nis already in our system, so therefore,\n\n169\n00:10:23.163 --> 00:10:24.874\nit's already predefined.\n\n170\n00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:29.790\nSo we predefine all of that, and we just\nverify that that information is correct.\n\n171\n00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:34.426\nNow that's just a really really\nsimple way is just a very simple\n\n172\n00:10:34.426 --> 00:10:37.236\nexample of what process model can do.\n\n173\n00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:41.987\nNow, an even better process\nmodel is to be able to evolve\n\n174\n00:10:41.987 --> 00:10:47.200\nthrough maturity and\nwe'll talk about that in a second.\n\n175\n00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.910\nTo be able to evolve through maturity to\na point where when the customer rings in,\n\n176\n00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.250\nthen actually,\nwe've detected their phone number, so\n\n177\n00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.130\nwe've already populated\nour call logging system.\n\n178\n00:10:59.130 --> 00:10:59.780\nWhy?\n\n179\n00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.330\nBecause we've had all of their\ndetails from HR already and so,\n\n180\n00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.090\nwe've populated all of this.\n\n181\n00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.820\nWe've had their details from asset and\nconfiguration management,\n\n182\n00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.060\nbecause the network detection tools\nthat are out there, tells us what that\n\n183\n00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:16.030\nperson is using, and what that user ID\nhas logged onto in terms of hardware and\n\n184\n00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.410\nsoftware, and what they have access to.\n\n185\n00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:18.939\nAnd so,\n\n186\n00:11:18.939 --> 00:11:24.167\nif we have all of those relationships in\nplace between those process databases and\n\n187\n00:11:24.167 --> 00:11:29.032\nthose process tools, then actually,\na lot of that's already done for us.\n\n188\n00:11:29.032 --> 00:11:33.250\nProcesses should not be over-engineered.\n\n189\n00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.240\nThey shouldn't be perceived as red tape.\n\n190\n00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.680\nProcesses should be something that\nhelp us to achieve that end goal.\n\n191\n00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.640\nI mean, I mentioned incident management.\n\n192\n00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.160\nIn the case of incident management,\nthe end goal is to what?\n\n193\n00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.700\nGet things up and running as quickly as\npossible to restore service operation.\n\n194\n00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:59.170\nAnd therefore, a process should help us\nto get there Quicker, with minimal waste.\n\n195\n00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.090\nAnd that's exactly what a process is.\n\n196\n00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.710\nSo I mentioned maturity,\nand I said, you know,\n\n197\n00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:10.510\nthe more we evolve in our process,\nthen the more mature it should become.\n\n198\n00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:17.028\nMaturity doesn't mean how old you are,\nwhat do you think maturity means?\n\n199\n00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:19.073\n&gt;&gt; Maturity, sorry,\n\n200\n00:12:19.073 --> 00:12:20.329\nall right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n201\n00:12:20.329 --> 00:12:23.018\n&gt;&gt; Maybe not the best person to ask about\n\n202\n00:12:23.018 --> 00:12:24.740\nmaturity.\n\n203\n00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:28.634\nBut maturity would be something\nthat we know this process works.\n\n204\n00:12:28.634 --> 00:12:31.180\nWe don't have any, like, kind of barriers.\n\n205\n00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.686\nAlmost that it becomes ingrained, like I\ndon't have to think about the process,\n\n206\n00:12:35.686 --> 00:12:39.150\nit's just become ingrained\nas part of what I'm doing.\n\n207\n00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.590\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily, not necessarily,\n\n208\n00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:46.250\nbecause if something comes ingrained,\nit still might be a bad process.\n\n209\n00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:54.495\nNow, you're thinking.\n&gt;&gt; So, let me further clarify.\n\n210\n00:12:54.495 --> 00:12:58.825\nThe pre-population of user-details, right?\n\n211\n00:12:58.825 --> 00:13:03.275\nWhen I am thinking of utilizing\nthose to log an issue or something.\n\n212\n00:13:03.275 --> 00:13:06.535\nIf those are pre-populated,\nthat becomes part of my process.\n\n213\n00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:07.565\nI don't have to think about it.\n\n214\n00:13:07.565 --> 00:13:09.595\nIt isn't like I am\nlooking at a flow chart.\n\n215\n00:13:09.595 --> 00:13:13.018\nI would think that that would be a more\nmature process Then something were you're\n\n216\n00:13:13.018 --> 00:13:16.437\nlike, all right, here's a check sheet of\nall the things that you need to do, and\n\n217\n00:13:16.437 --> 00:13:18.474\nthen maybe their some\nhiccups along the way,.\n\n218\n00:13:18.474 --> 00:13:20.320\n&gt;&gt; But you still have to think about it.\n\n219\n00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.340\nYou said,\nI don't have to think about it, but\n\n220\n00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.770\nof course you still\nhave to think about it.\n\n221\n00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.840\nBecause you have to verify\nthat information is correct.\n\n222\n00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.490\n&gt;&gt; But the cognitive load necessary to\n\n223\n00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:32.340\nverify that is way less than\nremembering all the steps necessary.\n\n224\n00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.930\nRight, yeah.\n\n225\n00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.760\nI'm kind of playing devil’s advocate here,\nand I know that I'm being a bit mean, but\n\n226\n00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.480\nthese are the questions that\nyou've got to ask yourself.\n\n227\n00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:46.941\nWe have a methodology for\nassessing the maturity of a process.\n\n228\n00:13:46.941 --> 00:13:51.037\nBy maturity we actually\nmean well-developed, and\n\n229\n00:13:51.037 --> 00:13:54.310\nwe mean aligned to the objective.\n\n230\n00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:58.900\nSo by maturity, we mean that a process\nhas got to be developed, it's got to be\n\n231\n00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.370\nefficient, and it's got to be aligned to\nthe objective that it's trying to achieve.\n\n232\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.450\nSo if you are going through a process.\n\n233\n00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:11.540\nAnd you are thinking to yourself, this\nis ridiculous, this isn't going to work,\n\n234\n00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.100\nor this is taking too much of my time.\n\n235\n00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.580\nThe minute something like that pops into\nyour head, that means that that process\n\n236\n00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:21.250\nis not mature,\nthat means it is not well-developed.\n\n237\n00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.129\nIt means that it is not\naligned to its objectives.\n\n238\n00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:29.690\nSo, you shouldn't be thinking something\nabout that this should be a clear purpose\n\n239\n00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.860\nbehind every single step in a process.\n\n240\n00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.780\nEven though it has been ultimate, and\n\n241\n00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.900\nthen what we want to do is we want to\nmake it as efficient as possibly can.\n\n242\n00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.780\nAnd so,\nin order to make it efficient then yeah,\n\n243\n00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.060\nwe're gonna use those\ntools to facilitate it.\n\n244\n00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.893\nBut we have to use the tools to\nfacilitate it in a way that makes sense.\n\n245\n00:14:46.893 --> 00:14:50.465\nAnd there is a key there,\nit has got to make sense.\n\n246\n00:14:50.465 --> 00:14:54.013\nAnd we have also got to be\nable to correct the tool,\n\n247\n00:14:54.013 --> 00:14:56.983\nbecause sometimes the tool is not right.\n\n248\n00:14:56.983 --> 00:15:02.391\nHave you ever called a Service Desk?\n&gt;&gt; I used to be part of a Service Desk.\n\n249\n00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:03.890\n&gt;&gt; No, that is not what I asked-\n\n250\n00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.392\n&gt;&gt; I have both perspectives,\n\n251\n00:15:06.392 --> 00:15:10.352\nI have called a service desk.\n&gt;&gt; Right, stop there.\n\n252\n00:15:10.352 --> 00:15:14.862\nYou've called a service desk and what\nabout, have you ever called a service desk\n\n253\n00:15:14.862 --> 00:15:18.480\nthat's had a script?\n&gt;&gt; I have.\n\n254\n00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.546\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n255\n00:15:19.546 --> 00:15:25.207\nwhat's your perception of\nthe service desk that has a script?\n\n256\n00:15:25.207 --> 00:15:29.749\nI'm biased, Jo, I'm biased.\n&gt;&gt; No, I want your perception as a user of\n\n257\n00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:33.508\nthe service desk that has a script.\n&gt;&gt; I at least start thinking they're\n\n258\n00:15:33.508 --> 00:15:38.330\ntrying to sell me something.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, that's what you like.\n\n259\n00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.204\n&gt;&gt; If it's overly scripted I'm like, aah.\n\n260\n00:15:40.204 --> 00:15:47.756\nFor some reason, that puts, for me,\nyou're trying to sell me something,\n\n261\n00:15:47.756 --> 00:15:52.476\nlike you're trying to\nshape the interaction in\n\n262\n00:15:52.476 --> 00:15:56.730\na way that maybe is not\nmy most beneficial.\n\n263\n00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:00.993\nBut that's kind of a negative one,\nif I was to remove that biased.\n\n264\n00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:03.120\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, I don't want you to.\n\n265\n00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.803\nYou see, this is one of the challenges\nthat we have in IT Is that,\n\n266\n00:16:06.803 --> 00:16:08.796\nwe find it very, very difficult.\n\n267\n00:16:08.796 --> 00:16:10.045\nThis is why I was stopping you.\n\n268\n00:16:10.045 --> 00:16:12.865\nWe find it very difficult to put ourselves\nin the perspective of the user and\n\n269\n00:16:12.865 --> 00:16:15.120\nput ourselves in\nthe perspective of the customer.\n\n270\n00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.110\nWe find it incredibly\ndifficult to detach ourselves.\n\n271\n00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.990\nNow I'm not you.\n\n272\n00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:24.770\nI have been and I have consulted with\nmany, many service desks over the years.\n\n273\n00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.420\n[INAUDIBLE] really.\n\n274\n00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.610\nAnd I am not above to picking up\na phone and saying, hello, this is Jo,\n\n275\n00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.100\nhow can I help you?\n\n276\n00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.990\nI actually quite enjoy that into action.\n\n277\n00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:39.720\nBut nevertheless,\nfrom a customer perspective, I also know\n\n278\n00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.660\nstraight away the minute I pick up\nthe phone and I call a service desk, and\n\n279\n00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.210\nI get somebody on the other end of\nthe phone who's following a script.\n\n280\n00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.950\nIt's very, very easy to detect.\n\n281\n00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.028\nNow, organizations would give\nservice desk analysts scripts,\n\n282\n00:16:54.028 --> 00:16:56.298\nbecause they want consistency, and\n\n283\n00:16:56.298 --> 00:17:01.438\nthey think that it's going to bring about\nefficiency in that particular process.\n\n284\n00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:04.350\nThe problem is, it doesn't.\n\n285\n00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:10.130\nBearing mind that what we're trying\nto achieve is value perception.\n\n286\n00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:15.310\nAnd the customer does not\nperceived value in that script.\n\n287\n00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:18.610\nAnd this is why I ask\nyou what you perceived.\n\n288\n00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:22.690\nThis is why I ask you from\nyou customer perception\n\n289\n00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:26.770\nbecause we have to start looking at\nthings from a customer perception.\n\n290\n00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:31.830\nAnd from the perception of the use of\nthe person that's calling the phone,\n\n291\n00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.340\ncalling the service desk.\n\n292\n00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:38.330\nIn that particular instance there is\nnothing more irritating as a user\n\n293\n00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:42.470\nthan somebody who has a script who is\nnot able to deviate from that script.\n\n294\n00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:46.020\nAnd therefore, that's not efficient.\n\n295\n00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.330\nAnd I've been on the other end of\nthe phone where somebody has said to me,\n\n296\n00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.620\ncould you turn it off and on again?\n\n297\n00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.980\nAnd I think well, I've tried all of this\nand I've tried resetting the router and\n\n298\n00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.910\nI've tried doing this and\nI've tried doing that.\n\n299\n00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.270\nBecause I'm a technical person,\n\n300\n00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:59.710\nI know what I'm doing and I've tried\neverything that you're asking me to do.\n\n301\n00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.500\nSo what do I do?\n\n302\n00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.450\nI'll be honest,\nyou will do the same as well.\n\n303\n00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:08.450\nYou will sit there and you will say,\nokay, Danielle, I'm turning that off.\n\n304\n00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.010\nAnd in the mean time,\nI'm going in the kitchen and\n\n305\n00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.870\nget myself a cup of tea, right?\n&gt;&gt; I have done that,\n\n306\n00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:16.670\nI am also been guilty of getting agitated.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n307\n00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.510\n&gt;&gt; But that's just human nature.\n\n308\n00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is and you see.\n\n309\n00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:24.630\nBut then we're not doing the service desk\nanalysts any favors then by giving them\n\n310\n00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.460\nthat script.\n\n311\n00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.150\nUnless we give them the script and\nwe say, here's the script.\n\n312\n00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:33.180\nBut we want you to follow this script,\nbut it is not cast in stone,\n\n313\n00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.330\nyou can deviate from the script.\n\n314\n00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.620\nAnd this is about efficiencies.\n\n315\n00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:42.540\nYou see, that particular process\nthat you've given them to follow,\n\n316\n00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.800\nis not efficient.\n\n317\n00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:48.690\nIt might be perceived as being\nefficient by the person that wrote it.\n\n318\n00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:52.030\nBut it's not efficient,\nbecause some users are more technical.\n\n319\n00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.470\nAnd therefore they don't know all of that,\nand\n\n320\n00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:57.230\nthey don't need to follow the script,\nand you have to trust that user.\n\n321\n00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.750\nAnd it's certainly not a mature process.\n\n322\n00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:04.155\nBecause maturity is about\nbeing more developed.\n\n323\n00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.380\nIt's not necessarily about\ngetting to something quicker.\n\n324\n00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.880\nAnd we also know what happens,\nbut at the end of the day,\n\n325\n00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.540\nif you receive a process\nto be too eurocratic.\n\n326\n00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.180\nYou're going to bypass it.\n\n327\n00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.630\nAnd then next time that issue happens,\nI'm not gonna call the service desk cuz\n\n328\n00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.555\nI know that what I'm\ngonna get is the script.\n\n329\n00:19:23.555 --> 00:19:24.820\nAnd I don't need the script.\n\n330\n00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.363\nI need to talk to somebody and\nI actually need to talk too.\n\n331\n00:19:27.363 --> 00:19:29.790\nI don't need to talk to the script.\n\n332\n00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:31.100\nI don't need to follow the steps.\n\n333\n00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:36.470\nI need to talk to them, which is why\nI wanted your opinion as a user.\n\n334\n00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.280\nYou see we get ourselves\ninvolved sometimes,\n\n335\n00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.210\ntoo wrapped up in\nthe mechanics of a process.\n\n336\n00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.380\nWe don't actually think about\nthe maturity of the process.\n\n337\n00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.540\nSo how do we define a process?\n\n338\n00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.090\nWell, in order to define a process,\n\n339\n00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:58.800\nwe first of all we have to understand\nwhat the objectives of that process are.\n\n340\n00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.297\nWhat is it that we want\nthat process to do?\n\n341\n00:20:01.297 --> 00:20:07.190\nAnd let's say, for instance,\nthat we want a process to restore service.\n\n342\n00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:11.480\nWe want a process to do\nsome incident management.\n\n343\n00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:16.000\nSo now we've understood what we want\nthe objective of the process to be.\n\n344\n00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.950\nNow we've got to work out, then why, well,\nif the objective is to restore service.\n\n345\n00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:21.560\nWhat could break?\n\n346\n00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.260\nSo then we work out what could break.\n\n347\n00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.070\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\n348\n00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:35.030\nAnd now, the next step,\nis to work out, okay, so what steps\n\n349\n00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:39.860\ndo we need to get from something broken,\nright the way through to something fixed?\n\n350\n00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.017\nThat's how we define our process.\n\n351\n00:20:43.017 --> 00:20:46.500\nAnd for instance, in management you're\nnot just going to have one process.\n\n352\n00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:50.450\nYou could have 15 or\n20 different processes.\n\n353\n00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.282\nBut then we also want to work\nout our process modules.\n\n354\n00:20:53.282 --> 00:20:54.690\nThose predefined steps,\n\n355\n00:20:54.690 --> 00:21:00.250\nhow are we going to get from something\nbroken to something fixed efficiently?\n\n356\n00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.260\nHow are we going to get\nthere with minimal waste?\n\n357\n00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.820\nOnce we've done all of that we\nthen have to ascertain what skills\n\n358\n00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.820\nwe need to be able to\nget from here to here.\n\n359\n00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.220\nSo who do I need to train?\n\n360\n00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:24.110\nI also need to work out how am I going to\nmeasure whether my process is working?\n\n361\n00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:30.780\nSo, did we get from here\nto here efficiently?\n\n362\n00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.150\nHow am I going to measure that?\n\n363\n00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.540\nThese are my key performance indicators.\n\n364\n00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.290\nSo I also need to work that out\nas well for every single process.\n\n365\n00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:43.980\nAnd I also then need to work\nout how I'm gonna obtain\n\n366\n00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.230\nfeedback from that particular process.\n\n367\n00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:52.100\nHow do I know whether that process is\nworking or whether that's not working.\n\n368\n00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.908\nMy key performance indicators will tell\nme whether something or would tell me\n\n369\n00:21:55.908 --> 00:21:59.492\nhow it's performing but it doesn't\ntell me whether it is doing its job.\n\n370\n00:21:59.492 --> 00:22:03.685\nWhether it is meeting it's objective\nwhich is tell me whether the process or\n\n371\n00:22:03.685 --> 00:22:05.832\nhow the process is performing?\n\n372\n00:22:05.832 --> 00:22:08.710\nSo I'll know how quickly\nI'm resolving incidents but\n\n373\n00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:12.220\nthat doesn't tell me whether I'm actually\nresolving incidence to meet the needs of\n\n374\n00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.392\nthe organization, it just tells\nme that I'm resolving incidents.\n\n375\n00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.383\nSo there's a lot of\nelements into a process.\n\n376\n00:22:18.383 --> 00:22:19.763\nA lot of elements.\n\n377\n00:22:19.763 --> 00:22:21.849\nThis takes a lot of sort.\n\n378\n00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:31.280\nBut then we're in a completely different\nscenario to what you may normally think.\n\n379\n00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:35.210\nBecause we're no longer with this\ninternal IT service provider.\n\n380\n00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.671\nAnd what we got to do is we've got\nto work out in this SIAM ecosystem.\n\n381\n00:22:38.671 --> 00:22:47.160\nHow we can create a process that works\nacross all of our service providers?\n\n382\n00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.220\nAnd I see Justin is itching\nto say something right now.\n\n383\n00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.046\n&gt;&gt; So, number one,\n\n384\n00:22:51.046 --> 00:22:53.862\nwhat you just said further\ncomplicated all the thoughts that\n\n385\n00:22:53.862 --> 00:22:56.396\nwere jumbled in my head.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, that's why I said\n\n386\n00:22:56.396 --> 00:22:59.502\nit before I asked you a question.\n&gt;&gt; I know and she's like watch this.\n\n387\n00:22:59.502 --> 00:23:01.839\nI'm gonna turn it up to 11.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n388\n00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:03.360\n&gt;&gt; Do you know [COUGH] I do\n\n389\n00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.090\nhave a question about like our\nkey performance indicator, and\n\n390\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:10.490\nI'm sure we'll dive more into this later,\nbut a lot of times we misconstrue\n\n391\n00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:16.330\nhow fast I can accomplish\nsomething as the only indicator.\n\n392\n00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.902\nBut that's not the only indicator for\n\n393\n00:23:18.902 --> 00:23:21.110\nresolving incidents.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n394\n00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.730\n&gt;&gt; Does that incident reoccur within\n\n395\n00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:24.430\ncertain amount,\n\n396\n00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:28.780\ncuz couldn't that be another KPI that\nwould determine whether our process was\n\n397\n00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.990\nactually working like we expected to?\n&gt;&gt; Right, and we're gonna get into this in\n\n398\n00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:35.060\na little while when we look at incident\nmanagement and problem management,\n\n399\n00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.510\nand we'll address both of those.\n\n400\n00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:41.650\nWill just both of those\nprocesses together because, yes,\n\n401\n00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:43.950\nyou've got to see whether\nan incident only occurs.\n\n402\n00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:48.576\nBut the efficiency of a process is not\njust well, it's gonna be efficient but\n\n403\n00:23:48.576 --> 00:23:53.007\nit's also gonna be effective,\nit's got to do what it's supposed to do.\n\n404\n00:23:53.007 --> 00:23:56.982\nAnd it's got to do it in\nan efficient way as well.\n\n405\n00:23:56.982 --> 00:24:01.355\nSo you're right, we're not just\nconcerned with whether we can do\n\n406\n00:24:01.355 --> 00:24:06.210\nsomething quickly we are also concerned\nwith how effective it is as well.\n\n407\n00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:10.145\nIn terms of the incident and the problem,\nwhich is what you're alluding to there,\n\n408\n00:24:10.145 --> 00:24:12.408\nwe're gonna get into\nthat in another episode.\n\n409\n00:24:12.408 --> 00:24:14.469\nSo make sure you check\nout that other episode.\n\n410\n00:24:14.469 --> 00:24:17.920\nBut I still say-\n&gt;&gt; I'll have to check that one out.\n\n411\n00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.078\nI'm sure I'll probably be there.\n\n412\n00:24:19.078 --> 00:24:22.410\n[LAUGH] But I'm kind of interested there.\n\n413\n00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:26.250\nBut as a follow-up question to\nsomething that kind of jolted my mind,\n\n414\n00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.083\nI had some time to think about it.\n\n415\n00:24:28.083 --> 00:24:33.745\nIf we have a process that is between\nseveral external service providers.\n\n416\n00:24:33.745 --> 00:24:38.925\nHow do we make a determination if\nwhat we're doing is effective,\n\n417\n00:24:38.925 --> 00:24:41.290\nefficient, between those.\n\n418\n00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.690\nWhat if one is working\nwell in one capacity, but\n\n419\n00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:48.150\nis not working well in another capacity?\n\n420\n00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:51.600\nDo we make the assertion that it's\nthe service provider's fault, or do we do,\n\n421\n00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.350\nI'm trying to think of how to\nbest manage that, how to say,\n\n422\n00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:56.830\nis this process maturing?\n\n423\n00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:01.120\nAre we taking the right steps for\nimproving it, or do we need to improve it\n\n424\n00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:05.210\nand something's going on there?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n425\n00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:10.060\nyou just asked all the questions that\nwe would be asking of the organization.\n\n426\n00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.320\nHow are you gonna do that?\n\n427\n00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.347\nWell, we're asking this as\nthe service integrator.\n\n428\n00:25:13.347 --> 00:25:16.563\nAnd these are the questions that\nthe customer is asking of the service\n\n429\n00:25:16.563 --> 00:25:17.570\nintegrator as well.\n\n430\n00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:21.520\nThe service integrator is managing\nall of those relationships.\n\n431\n00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.362\nSo it's a lot of responsibilities\non the service integrator.\n\n432\n00:25:25.362 --> 00:25:30.163\nBecause the customer is saying to\nthe service integrator, hey, look,\n\n433\n00:25:30.163 --> 00:25:32.350\nwe need you to do this.\n\n434\n00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:35.230\nAnd by the way, you've got 15\ndifferent service providers and\n\n435\n00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:37.830\nwe need you to coordinate\nincident management.\n\n436\n00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:41.520\nAnd in previous episodes we've talked\nabout all of those service level\n\n437\n00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.100\ntargets, etc.\n\n438\n00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.250\nWe've looked at how difficult it is\n\n439\n00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.930\nto actually come up with\na service level target.\n\n440\n00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.027\nAnd in one instance we talked\nabout a response target.\n\n441\n00:25:53.027 --> 00:25:57.845\nAnd we discussed how difficult it was\nto come up with a response target when\n\n442\n00:25:57.845 --> 00:26:03.080\nwe've got a target that's a service\nintegrated with the customer four hours.\n\n443\n00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.610\nBut then we've got 15 other\nservice providers that can\n\n444\n00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:08.050\nall contribute towards that four hours.\n\n445\n00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:09.550\nWell, here we are again.\n\n446\n00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:12.463\nAnd we've got one incident\nmanagement process, for example.\n\n447\n00:26:12.463 --> 00:26:14.509\nAnd we've got 15 service providers, and\n\n448\n00:26:14.509 --> 00:26:16.670\nthey may all be using\ndifferent tools as well.\n\n449\n00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.540\nAnd they may all be working\nin different ways, so\n\n450\n00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.160\nthis is the role of\nthe service integrator.\n\n451\n00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:26.160\nAnd by the way, I mean,\nSIAM is going to help you.\n\n452\n00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.438\nIt's gonna give you some direction,\nbut SIAM's not plug and play.\n\n453\n00:26:29.438 --> 00:26:34.550\nYou can't just simply go to the foundation\nbook and say, hey, look, here's a process.\n\n454\n00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.010\nHere's an example of a process.\n\n455\n00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:39.660\nWell, we'll use this one then,\nbecause you don't do that.\n\n456\n00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:45.830\nWe can't, it won't work, every single\nservice provider is different.\n\n457\n00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:51.440\nSo yes, you adopt,\nyou evolve into a SIAM ecosystem,\n\n458\n00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:57.380\nbut you have to adapt every single\nprocess to suit your unique environment.\n\n459\n00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:01.960\nThere are no two environments the same.\n\n460\n00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:07.384\nEven though another organization may be in\nexactly the same industry sector as you.\n\n461\n00:27:07.384 --> 00:27:11.330\nThat doesn't mean that they\nwork in exactly the same way.\n\n462\n00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:16.280\nSo this actually isn't as straightforward\nas you might think it is.\n\n463\n00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.030\nAnd the more service providers\nthat we add into this,\n\n464\n00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:22.280\nthen obviously the more\ncomplex it could be.\n\n465\n00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:26.140\nAnd yet right at the very start of this\nepisode, I started off by saying we've got\n\n466\n00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:31.122\nto keep it simple.\n&gt;&gt; Every time you say that, Jo, I think,\n\n467\n00:27:31.122 --> 00:27:32.239\nI agree with you.\n\n468\n00:27:32.239 --> 00:27:36.260\nBut I've been burned so many times,\nI'm going, that's simple, it's not simple.\n\n469\n00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.570\nThis is actually a lot\nmore cognitive load and\n\n470\n00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.360\nit's just because we're\ndealing with people.\n\n471\n00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.147\nWe're dealing with multiple kind\nof these service providers.\n\n472\n00:27:44.147 --> 00:27:48.407\nIt's not gonna be simple, we're gonna\ntry to keep it as simple as we can,\n\n473\n00:27:48.407 --> 00:27:51.096\nif I'm understanding you correctly.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n474\n00:27:51.096 --> 00:27:54.310\nyes, well,\nyou say it's not gonna be simple.\n\n475\n00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:57.880\nSome things could be incredibly simple,\nand some things could actually be\n\n476\n00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.238\nalleviated by the fact that we've\ngot a number of service providers.\n\n477\n00:28:01.238 --> 00:28:05.923\nBecause we've got different skills within\ndifferent service providers, and they can\n\n478\n00:28:05.923 --> 00:28:10.430\nactually help us with the relationship\nmanagement between the service providers.\n\n479\n00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.410\nThat's only on condition though that\nthey're all going to talk to each other\n\n480\n00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:15.890\nand that's another challenge as well.\n\n481\n00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:20.500\nAre they actually all going to,\nwell, are they gonna get along?\n\n482\n00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.965\nAre they going to collaborate,\ndo we have a cohesive service?\n\n483\n00:28:23.965 --> 00:28:30.630\nUltimately, the test is whether our\ncustomers perceive value, that's our test.\n\n484\n00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.320\nSo what do we have, and\n\n485\n00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.570\nI don't wanna cut you off unless\nyou have any other questions.\n\n486\n00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.820\nBut what we have over\nthe next few episodes,\n\n487\n00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:44.350\nis quite a few processes that\nwe're going to take a look at.\n\n488\n00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:46.320\nYou can see right in front of you now.\n\n489\n00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.624\nLook, there's quite a few\nof them as I have said.\n\n490\n00:28:47.624 --> 00:28:50.663\nJust the odd one or two, maybe [LAUGH] and\n\n491\n00:28:50.663 --> 00:28:54.640\nwe're going to start off\nin our next episode by it.\n\n492\n00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:59.010\nSo please join us looking at audit control\nand business relationship management.\n\n493\n00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:02.830\nAnd then we're going to over the next\nfew episodes we have kind of not so\n\n494\n00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:08.500\nmuch a miniseries going on as a full blown\n[LAUGH] show in its own right, really.\n\n495\n00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.560\nWe're gonna be looking at\neach one of those processes.\n\n496\n00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.310\nAnd what the purpose of each\none of those processes are.\n\n497\n00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:16.690\nAnd we're gonna be looking at sort\nof individual complexities and\n\n498\n00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:21.100\nchallenges that we have\nwith managing each process\n\n499\n00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:25.593\nacross the entire SIAM ecosystem.\n&gt;&gt; Well Jo,\n\n500\n00:29:25.593 --> 00:29:30.390\nyou've kind of set forth a map that,\nit is necessary.\n\n501\n00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.360\nWe're going to have to\nlook at each one of these.\n\n502\n00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.390\nI'm kind of interested to see\nhow simple can we make these.\n\n503\n00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:36.695\nHow complex does it end up being?\n\n504\n00:29:36.695 --> 00:29:40.727\nAnd there are a lot of things that\nI don't know, or maybe I do know,\n\n505\n00:29:40.727 --> 00:29:44.761\nand I just haven't used that\nterminology that's set forth, so-\n\n506\n00:29:44.761 --> 00:29:46.589\n&gt;&gt; And I also want to mention,\n\n507\n00:29:46.589 --> 00:29:50.724\nwhile we're just sort of wrapping\nup our introduction here,\n\n508\n00:29:50.724 --> 00:29:55.770\nis don't forget that these guys\nhave got a test at the end of this.\n\n509\n00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:56.530\nAnd so have you, by the way.\n\n510\n00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.840\n[LAUGH] These guys have got\na test at the end of this.\n\n511\n00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.252\nAnd so it's very,\n\n512\n00:30:01.252 --> 00:30:07.550\nvery important that you understand\nthe objectives of each of those processes.\n\n513\n00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:11.660\nAnd not just because, obviously, you want\nto apply them in your own organization.\n\n514\n00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:14.400\nBut because yes,\nyou will be tested on processes.\n\n515\n00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.494\nSo we want to make sure that you\nunderstand what each of the processes are.\n\n516\n00:30:18.494 --> 00:30:23.920\nWhat they are they for, and also what the\nchallenges are with each of the processes?\n\n517\n00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.814\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jo, you've set the bar high, but\n\n518\n00:30:25.814 --> 00:30:29.132\nit's gonna take us a little while to\nget through all of those processes.\n\n519\n00:30:29.132 --> 00:30:31.026\nSo, we're not gonna have\ntime in this episode, so\n\n520\n00:30:31.026 --> 00:30:33.505\nwe're gonna have to get out of here,\nbut definitely join us back.\n\n521\n00:30:33.505 --> 00:30:37.316\nBut for now, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n522\n00:30:37.316 --> 00:30:38.325\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n523\n00:30:38.325 --> 00:30:39.461\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n524\n00:30:39.461 --> 00:30:47.062\n[MUSIC]\n\n525\n00:30:47.062 --> 00:30:49.911\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

Fransisco,\nCalifornia [CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:08.311\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.311 --> 00:00:11.705\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.705 --> 00:00:16.320\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITPro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.590\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\n\n7\n00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.403\nwe're continuing on with\nour SIAM foundation series.\n\n8\n00:00:19.403 --> 00:00:23.310\nAnd well we're gonna be diving\nmore into SIAM processes.\n\n9\n00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.766\nIn particular, in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at audit and\n\n10\n00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:27.769\ncontrol, and BRM.\n\n11\n00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.950\nAnd here to help us along in that\nvery endeavor is Ms Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:31.850\nHow you doing today, Jo?\n\n13\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.290\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Justin.\n\n14\n00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.110\nHow are you?\n\n15\n00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.478\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic as well,\nand acronyms, I do love them.\n\n16\n00:00:38.478 --> 00:00:40.744\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Before we dive into these two\n\n17\n00:00:40.744 --> 00:00:43.727\nrespective processes,\ncan you tell me what BRM is?\n\n18\n00:00:43.727 --> 00:00:45.920\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n19\n00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.682\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you have it ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n20\n00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:49.543\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, BRM,\n\n21\n00:00:49.543 --> 00:00:51.430\nBusiness Relationship Management.\n\n22\n00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.600\nIt's quite a common acronym amongst\nthe service management world.\n\n23\n00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.340\nIt's something that we're gonna take\na look in more depth a little bit\n\n24\n00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.700\nlater on but yes, it's a really,\nreally important process.\n\n25\n00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.400\nThese two processes actually are processes\nthat sit within the service integrator.\n\n26\n00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.315\nNow, despite the fact that\nall of our processes, well,\n\n27\n00:01:12.315 --> 00:01:15.600\nwe'd like to think that they're\nowned by the service integrator,\n\n28\n00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.190\nthese processes especially are actually\nconducted by the service integrator.\n\n29\n00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.090\nAnd these are two incredibly\nimportant processes.\n\n30\n00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.520\nLet's just say they're at\nthe beginning of the ecosystem,\n\n31\n00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.837\nthey're at the beginning of\nthe lifecycle of our services.\n\n32\n00:01:35.837 --> 00:01:40.256\nBut audit and control is very\nimportant because audit and\n\n33\n00:01:40.256 --> 00:01:43.670\ncontrol ensures that the ecosystem works.\n\n34\n00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.689\nWhereas BRM ensures that we are aligned\nto the needs of the customer.\n\n35\n00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.590\nSo, two incredibly important processes.\n\n36\n00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.390\nSo I think what we'll probably do is\nwe'll start off with audit and control.\n\n37\n00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.160\nDoes that sound like a good place?\n\n38\n00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.365\n&gt;&gt; You are the subject matter expert in\nthis field because goodness knows that\n\n39\n00:02:02.365 --> 00:02:06.780\n[LAUGH] I would be leading us down a dark\nand dreary path if I had to do it.\n\n40\n00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.850\nSo we're gonna start with audit and\ncontrol.\n\n41\n00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.820\nMakes perfect sense to me,\nso let's get it started.\n\n42\n00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.120\n&gt;&gt; Well, audit and control, to be fair,\nis well, it's pretty much as it says.\n\n43\n00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.440\nIt's about controlling the ecosystem.\n\n44\n00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.220\nIt's about controlling\nall of our processes.\n\n45\n00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.070\nIn our ecosystem,\nwe've got a very complex set up.\n\n46\n00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.905\nWe have got many,\n\n47\n00:02:26.905 --> 00:02:30.590\nmany service providers that are working\nunderneath the service integrator,\n\n48\n00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.188\nand we also have our service integrator\nlayer as well as the customer layer.\n\n49\n00:02:34.188 --> 00:02:39.027\nSo those service providers could be\ninternal and they could be external, and\n\n50\n00:02:39.027 --> 00:02:43.494\nhow on earth are we going to ensure\nthat every single service provider is\n\n51\n00:02:43.494 --> 00:02:45.690\nfollowing every single process?\n\n52\n00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.530\nWell, guess what,\nthat's what audit and control is for.\n\n53\n00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.390\nAudit and control is here to\nensure a couple of things really.\n\n54\n00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.860\nOne is that every single service\nprovider is following each process, and\n\n55\n00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.880\nthat understands each process, and\n\n56\n00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.110\nthat it's following the process\nin a consistent manner.\n\n57\n00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.960\nBecause it's important that we have\nconsistency across our service delivery.\n\n58\n00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.400\nBut they are also there to\nperform any audits as well.\n\n59\n00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.610\nAnd this gets really really tricky for\nthem as a process when we start thinking\n\n60\n00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.890\nabout things like legislation or\nregulations that we may have.\n\n61\n00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.021\nIn certain types of service\nprovider organization,\n\n62\n00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:29.637\nlike government for instance,\nor maybe even in health care,\n\n63\n00:03:29.637 --> 00:03:34.239\nor maybe the financial institutions,\nthen we will have a lot of regulations.\n\n64\n00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.592\nNow, if our customer organization\nis an organization that\n\n65\n00:03:38.592 --> 00:03:40.507\nhas a lot of regulations,\n\n66\n00:03:40.507 --> 00:03:46.350\nthen all of the service providers must\ntherefore adhere to those regulations.\n\n67\n00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.510\nLet's think about data protection for\ninstance.\n\n68\n00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.648\nSo in a healthcare service,\nno matter where in the world we are.\n\n69\n00:03:53.648 --> 00:03:55.320\nIn a healthcare service,\n\n70\n00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.260\nwe have to protect the personal\ninformation of our patients.\n\n71\n00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.520\nWhich means that if we have external\nservice providers let's say,\n\n72\n00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.640\nand I think about healthcare\norganizations that I've worked with,\n\n73\n00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.360\nwe've got service providers that provide\nthings like MRI machines for instance.\n\n74\n00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.570\nWe've got service providers that provide,\nsay, cameras and\n\n75\n00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.600\nequipment for the operating theaters.\n\n76\n00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.640\nWe've got service providers that provide\ndatabases full of customer records for\n\n77\n00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.490\ninstance.\n\n78\n00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.540\nAnd of course those customer records\ncan be shared amongst other healthcare\n\n79\n00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.500\nprofessionals, but can't be shared\namongst anybody else in the world.\n\n80\n00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.230\nSo, we've got a lot of regulations\nin place there, lots of regulations.\n\n81\n00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.430\nBut we've got lots of service providers.\n\n82\n00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.270\nAudit and control's role is to\n\n83\n00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.300\nensure that all of those service\nproviders adhere to the regulations and\n\n84\n00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.035\nthe standards that we have cuz they're\nlegal requirements for data protection.\n\n85\n00:04:56.035 --> 00:04:58.390\nThat's just one example.\n\n86\n00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.520\nBut they have to, audit and\ncontrol have to ensure that each service\n\n87\n00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.294\nprovider is not actually doing what\nthey shouldn't be doing with our data.\n\n88\n00:05:09.294 --> 00:05:14.327\nWhether it be patient data, whether it be\ndata to do with our equipment, whether\n\n89\n00:05:14.327 --> 00:05:19.086\nit be data to do with our employees,\nour staff, and nurses and our doctors.\n\n90\n00:05:19.086 --> 00:05:24.515\nAudit and control's job is to ensure\nthat that particular service provider,\n\n91\n00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:27.889\nand all of the service\nproviders collectively,\n\n92\n00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.850\ndoesn't do anything that they are not\nsupposed to do it with that data.\n\n93\n00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.340\nThey also have to, on the flip side,\n\n94\n00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.130\nensure that every single service provider\nis following all of our processes as well.\n\n95\n00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.140\nSo this is not an insignificant process,\nthis is not an insignificant role,\n\n96\n00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.250\nand this is not an optional role either.\n\n97\n00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.435\nEven if this were to be an assumed\nrole and we were to have somebody\n\n98\n00:05:51.435 --> 00:05:56.470\nwho was assuming the role of\na controller or an auditor.\n\n99\n00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.750\nNevertheless, this is still important.\n\n100\n00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.160\nOur service integrator and\n\n101\n00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.900\nour ecosystem is not actually going to\nwork without this particular process.\n\n102\n00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.507\nThis process has to ensure\nthat every single service\n\n103\n00:06:11.507 --> 00:06:16.760\nprovider adheres to exactly\nthe same process policy,\n\n104\n00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.870\nthat they adhere to exactly the same\nguidelines as all of our other processes.\n\n105\n00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.480\nSo let's take a look then just very\nbriefly at the process purpose itself.\n\n106\n00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.060\nAnd the purpose is just to provide\nassurance that they are being delivered,\n\n107\n00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.240\nthat all of our services are being\ndelivered in accordance with\n\n108\n00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.100\ndocumented requirements.\n\n109\n00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.450\nAnd that's documented requirement in\nterms of back-ups, in terms of restores,\n\n110\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:48.720\nin terms of data protection, in terms of\nservice continuity, in terms of security,\n\n111\n00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.250\nas well as all of the things, the examples\nthat we have just spoken about.\n\n112\n00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.370\nSo as I've said,\nthis is not an insignificant role, and\n\n113\n00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.810\nthis applies to absolutely\nevery single service provider.\n\n114\n00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.015\nAnd I see Justin here looking at\nthis with a very thoughtful face.\n\n115\n00:07:08.015 --> 00:07:12.504\n&gt;&gt; I'm just thinking this is very meta,\nthis process is\n\n116\n00:07:12.504 --> 00:07:16.933\nto ensure that all the other processes-\n&gt;&gt; Do their job.\n\n117\n00:07:16.933 --> 00:07:18.341\n&gt;&gt; Do what they're supposed to be doing.\n\n118\n00:07:18.341 --> 00:07:20.500\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n119\n00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.300\n&gt;&gt; It's always those things where you're\nlike I have a process about the processes.\n\n120\n00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:31.940\nNow, a lot of these audit and\ncontrol just there regulatory,\n\n121\n00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.565\nthey have to stay on top of regulatory and\nlegislation changes that may alter some\n\n122\n00:07:36.565 --> 00:07:42.280\npre-existing processes that they\nhave that manage other processes.\n\n123\n00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.310\nWhat I mean is,\nwe're talking about medical data, right?\n\n124\n00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:45.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n125\n00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.560\n&gt;&gt; HIPAA controls,\nmaybe there's a change to that policy.\n\n126\n00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.934\nAre they the ones that inform other people\nthat the process may need to be changed?\n\n127\n00:07:53.934 --> 00:07:58.753\nOr do they make the changes, or are they\njust kind of the overseer of that?\n\n128\n00:07:58.753 --> 00:08:03.516\n&gt;&gt; Well I'd expect The audit and\ncontroller, that process owner.\n\n129\n00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:07.127\nI'd expect them to know about\nthe regulations that apply within their\n\n130\n00:08:07.127 --> 00:08:10.570\nindustry sector and\nalso that apply within their country.\n\n131\n00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:14.590\nI mean you mentioned HIPAA, now,\nHIPAA is something that is purely for\n\n132\n00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:19.110\nthe US and it is what we would\nconsider to be data protection.\n\n133\n00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.850\nWhich is why I talk about data protection,\n\n134\n00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.870\ncuz that's a sort of more generic\nterm that applies around the world,\n\n135\n00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:30.070\nbut this is all to do with the protection\nof personal information and personal data.\n\n136\n00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.570\nSo I would expect the audit and\n\n137\n00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:37.570\ncontroller to keep abreast of\nany changes in legislation,\n\n138\n00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.577\nto keep abreast of any\nchanges in the industry.\n\n139\n00:08:41.577 --> 00:08:45.020\nAnd to ensure that any new\nsuppliers that they bring on,\n\n140\n00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:50.125\nany new service providers, are also\naware of their requirements as well.\n\n141\n00:08:50.125 --> 00:08:55.700\nSo, as I've said, if this is not\nan insignificant role, because this\n\n142\n00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.110\nparticular role is not just here to ensure\nthat the processes are working but it's\n\n143\n00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.980\nhere to ensure that the service providers\nare following the processes as well.\n\n144\n00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.680\nSo it's not really just a role that\nlooks at the admin side of things and\n\n145\n00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.490\nmakes sure that our processes\nhave got documentation.\n\n146\n00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.060\nYeah, sure it does that.\n\n147\n00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.760\nBut it's also here to ensure that\n\n148\n00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.960\nour processes are being followed by\nthe service provider organization.\n\n149\n00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.290\n&gt;&gt; So is audit and\ncontrol kinda a management role, or\n\n150\n00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:28.920\nwould they need to have more power because\nthey're divvying out, I don't know,\n\n151\n00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.768\npunishments or our goodness, right?\n\n152\n00:09:31.768 --> 00:09:37.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, [LAUGH] I don't like the use of\nthe word punishment, that's a bit scary.\n\n153\n00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:42.120\nBut we are dealing with service providers\nand so, with our external service\n\n154\n00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.390\nproviders, I expect there to be penalties\nand incentives in the contract.\n\n155\n00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.000\nAnd it's true that we may\nactually have penalties and\n\n156\n00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.630\nincentives in those contracts\nthat deal with non-compliance.\n\n157\n00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.430\nAnd I would be perfectly honest with you,\n\n158\n00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:00.250\nI would expect to see\na penalty in a contract.\n\n159\n00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:05.470\nIf in any circumstance that\na service provider does expose\n\n160\n00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:10.410\nthe customer to any potential lawsuit or\nexposes the service\n\n161\n00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:16.980\nprovider to any potential sort of\nlegislative action, for instance.\n\n162\n00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.010\nSo, I would expect to\nsee something like that.\n\n163\n00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:25.340\nSo, this means that the audit and\ncontrol process needs to be empowered,\n\n164\n00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:30.445\nnot necessarily have power,\n[LAUGH] but they certainly need\n\n165\n00:10:30.445 --> 00:10:35.465\nto be empowered,\nnow you've got me saying it [INAUDIBLE].\n\n166\n00:10:35.465 --> 00:10:37.895\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is a kind of a narrow room,\nright?\n\n167\n00:10:37.895 --> 00:10:40.590\nThey need to be empowered\nto make decisions but\n\n168\n00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:46.230\nnot necessarily powerful in the capacity\nof being able to exert that.\n\n169\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.844\nAm I slicing the hair in\nthe right direction there?\n\n170\n00:10:49.844 --> 00:10:50.820\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n171\n00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.690\n&gt;&gt; No, I was totally wrong.\n\n172\n00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.780\n&gt;&gt; No,\nthey're not empowered to make decisions,\n\n173\n00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.360\nit's the process forum\nthat makes the decisions.\n\n174\n00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.760\nAnd also, it's the business\nthat makes the decisions.\n\n175\n00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.133\nWhen we're talking about business\ndecisions such as legislative requirements\n\n176\n00:11:03.133 --> 00:11:05.070\netc, it's not even the business.\n\n177\n00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.527\nThe business will say to us\nthis is what we want to do, and\n\n178\n00:11:08.527 --> 00:11:12.502\nit's up to us to adhere then to\nthose particular requirements,\n\n179\n00:11:12.502 --> 00:11:17.754\nwhich means that it's the business that's\ngoing to tell us exactly what they want.\n\n180\n00:11:17.754 --> 00:11:22.084\nSo these guys aren't actually making any\ndecisions at all, the person that is\n\n181\n00:11:22.084 --> 00:11:26.939\nrunning audit and control isn't making the\ndecision, it's the process forum that's\n\n182\n00:11:26.939 --> 00:11:31.944\nmaking the decision, and it's actually the\norganization that's making the decision.\n\n183\n00:11:31.944 --> 00:11:37.145\nSo no, they're not making decisions,\nwhat they are, I know that it sounds\n\n184\n00:11:37.145 --> 00:11:42.510\nquite like quite a tough word, but\nthey're enforcers of those decisions.\n\n185\n00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.236\nThey have to ensure that these\nparticular standards and\n\n186\n00:11:46.236 --> 00:11:48.540\nthe legislation is being upheld.\n\n187\n00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.020\nBut this kind of brings me quite nicely\n\n188\n00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.030\ninto the Business Relationship Management\nrole.\n\n189\n00:11:56.030 --> 00:12:00.580\nAnd the BRM role, well,\nis there to provide a bridge\n\n190\n00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:06.090\nbetween the service integrator,\nor rather IT, and the customer.\n\n191\n00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.770\nAnd so\nthe BRM role is a really important role.\n\n192\n00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:14.510\nIf we just take a look at the purpose of\nthe BRM role for a moment you'll see that\n\n193\n00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:21.060\ntheir role is relationship management,\nthe keyword being that word, relationship.\n\n194\n00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:28.200\nThey provide the link between\nthe customer and the person that\n\n195\n00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:33.080\nis providing the service on any particular\npoint in time, or in any given day.\n\n196\n00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.100\nWhat's the difference between\na customer and a user?\n\n197\n00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.980\n&gt;&gt; I would think a customer\nis possibly a group of\n\n198\n00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.920\nusers that are all dependent\non that respective service.\n\n199\n00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:52.799\nI tell you what Jo, I'm like for nine\nhere [LAUGH] So a customer and a user.\n\n200\n00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:54.550\nI don't know,\nI haven't really thought about that.\n\n201\n00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.880\n&gt;&gt; Customers can be users.\n\n202\n00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.376\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense, I'm trying to think.\n\n203\n00:12:58.376 --> 00:13:01.236\n&gt;&gt; No, it doesn't, if you don't know what\nthey are then how could it make sense?\n\n204\n00:13:01.236 --> 00:13:04.070\n&gt;&gt; No, no, I'm trying to think\nof when that is not the case.\n\n205\n00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.140\nThat's what doesn't make sense to me.\n\n206\n00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.500\nWhen is a customer not a user?\n\n207\n00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.550\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes I don't\nknow where his mind is.\n\n208\n00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.414\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes I don't either.\n\n209\n00:13:10.414 --> 00:13:11.596\n&gt;&gt; I just wanna say that, okay?.\n\n210\n00:13:11.596 --> 00:13:12.096\n&gt;&gt; It just comes out of left field.\n\n211\n00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.490\nWhen I'm talking about a service,\nwhen does a customer know how to use it?\n\n212\n00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:19.540\n&gt;&gt; All the time.\n\n213\n00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.260\n&gt;&gt; Except when they are users.\n\n214\n00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.010\n&gt;&gt; Let's put this in simple terms,\nshall we?\n\n215\n00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.850\nWe'll go with that.\n\n216\n00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:35.110\nSo if we go into a coffee shop and\nI buy you a coffee.\n\n217\n00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:39.500\nWho's the customer?\n\n218\n00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.550\n&gt;&gt; Now I feel like we're splitting hairs,\nJo.\n\n219\n00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.540\n&gt;&gt; We're not splitting hairs.\n\n220\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.900\nThis is really important.\n\n221\n00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.110\nWho's the customer?\n\n222\n00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.473\n&gt;&gt; I would say you're the customer\nif you're buying me the coffee\n\n223\n00:13:49.473 --> 00:13:50.030\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n\n224\n00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.669\n&gt;&gt; Because you're the actual transactee or\nwhatever.\n\n225\n00:13:50.669 --> 00:13:52.590\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm paying.\n\n226\n00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.210\nRight, okay.\n\n227\n00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.124\nWho's the user?\n\n228\n00:13:56.915 --> 00:13:59.390\n&gt;&gt; Depends on what you\nboth me a coffee for.\n\n229\n00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:02.455\nNo, I'm joking [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I mean it could be to wear\n\n230\n00:14:02.455 --> 00:14:04.113\nto be perfectly honest.\n\n231\n00:14:04.113 --> 00:14:06.270\nWe're getting to that point.\n\n232\n00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:09.480\n&gt;&gt; If I'm drinking the coffee, I would be,\nI guess the user of the coffee?\n\n233\n00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.200\n&gt;&gt; Right, you're the user of the service.\n\n234\n00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.040\nOkay, we're gonna take this a little\nbit further because this is quite\n\n235\n00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.410\nimportant, okay?\n\n236\n00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.100\nSo, I'm the customer cuz I'm paying and\n\n237\n00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.890\nyou're the user because you're using the\nservice, you're drinking the coffee, okay?\n\n238\n00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.990\nSo, am I a user?\n\n239\n00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.684\n&gt;&gt; Did you buy yourself a coffee as well?\n\n240\n00:14:32.684 --> 00:14:35.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] See, he is getting there,\nhe's getting there.\n\n241\n00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:36.170\nNo, I didn't.\n\n242\n00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.330\n&gt;&gt; Okay, then no.\n\n243\n00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.690\n&gt;&gt; Right, so the coffee shop,\nthe person who is behind\n\n244\n00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.760\nthe counter in the coffee shop\n&gt;&gt; They are the service provider.\n\n245\n00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.465\n&gt;&gt; They are the service provider,\nthat's right, well it's not,\n\n246\n00:14:46.465 --> 00:14:49.620\nit's the entire coffee shop that's\nthe service provider, okay?\n\n247\n00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:54.460\nSo I am the customer, you're the user.\n\n248\n00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:00.040\nWe'll call her Meghan, for\ninstance, just as an example.\n\n249\n00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:05.480\nSo, does Meghan care whether\nyou like your coffee or not?\n\n250\n00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.480\n&gt;&gt; I would say so, yes.\n\n251\n00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.660\n&gt;&gt; Why?\nCuz I'm paying, you're not.\n\n252\n00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.959\n&gt;&gt; But I may have sway over you.\n\n253\n00:15:13.959 --> 00:15:18.618\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nthe term that we use in IT is influence.\n\n254\n00:15:18.618 --> 00:15:23.111\nYeah, you can influence me,\nbecause the next time I say let's go for\n\n255\n00:15:23.111 --> 00:15:25.212\na coffee, you might say yeah, but\n\n256\n00:15:25.212 --> 00:15:30.340\nwe're not going there, because well-\n&gt;&gt; Bad coffee.\n\n257\n00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.040\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, or bad service, yeah?\n\n258\n00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.270\nSo, customer pays, the user, uses.\n\n259\n00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.620\nSometimes the customer is also a user.\n\n260\n00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:46.941\nI'm gonna go back to ITIL, because\nobviously for most service organizations,\n\n261\n00:15:46.941 --> 00:15:50.943\nfor most iameco systems we've\ncome from ITIL perspective.\n\n262\n00:15:50.943 --> 00:15:55.350\nAnd we've come from and ITIL framework,\nand so the same principle still applies.\n\n263\n00:15:55.350 --> 00:16:00.907\nSo in ITIL services, a means of delivering\nvalue By facilitating the outcomes\n\n264\n00:16:00.907 --> 00:16:06.940\nthat customers want to achieve without\nthe ownership of specific customers.\n\n265\n00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.500\nIn other words,\nwe will provide you with a service.\n\n266\n00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.190\nWe will facilitate an outcome, but\n\n267\n00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.530\nwe'll take ownership of the costs and\nrisks you want.\n\n268\n00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:20.940\nSo, in the case of coffee shop\nthen I'm gonna give you coffee and\n\n269\n00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:25.570\nwe will on the costs and\nrisks, we'll do this.\n\n270\n00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:30.031\nSo specific costs then, when we go for\na coffee, I'm a customer,\n\n271\n00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:32.116\ndo I care about specific cost?\n\n272\n00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:38.230\nDo I care how much the cup costs and how\nmuch water, and how much the coffee cost?\n\n273\n00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.050\n&gt;&gt; No, you're looking at a different\ncost structure based on what's\n\n274\n00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:41.860\ndelivered to you.\n\n275\n00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.111\nI want a cup of coffee.\nIt is this amount of money I don't care\n\n276\n00:16:44.111 --> 00:16:46.200\nwhat the individual components, right?\n\n277\n00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:46.910\n&gt;&gt; That's it, right.\n\n278\n00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:50.300\nWhat do I care about as a customer?\n\n279\n00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.070\n&gt;&gt; Whether the coffee's good?\n\n280\n00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:52.570\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n281\n00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.610\nNo, you're wrong.\n\n282\n00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:55.620\n&gt;&gt; Wait a minute, as a customer.\n\n283\n00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; As a customer.\n\n284\n00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:56.651\n&gt;&gt; As a customer, sorry.\n\n285\n00:16:56.651 --> 00:16:59.880\nSee, this is my mind\nworks in weird ways Joe.\n\n286\n00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.350\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n287\n00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:06.583\n&gt;&gt; As a customer I care about cost and\nwait for it.\n\n288\n00:17:06.583 --> 00:17:11.988\nYeah, and whether this, see it gets\nweird because if you're not a user,\n\n289\n00:17:11.988 --> 00:17:17.045\neven if I'm paying for something\nthat someone else is using, I still\n\n290\n00:17:17.045 --> 00:17:22.650\ncare whether that service is valuable\nto them or is it appropriate for them.\n\n291\n00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:26.754\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] That sounds to me like\nyou've got a bit too much of a sort of\n\n292\n00:17:26.754 --> 00:17:28.198\na caring personality.\n\n293\n00:17:28.198 --> 00:17:30.237\nI [CROSSTALK] haven't been\ncall that in a long time.\n\n294\n00:17:30.237 --> 00:17:34.835\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm a customer I care about\n\n295\n00:17:34.835 --> 00:17:36.537\nwhether that cup is full.\n\n296\n00:17:39.303 --> 00:17:40.606\nSo I want value for money.\n\n297\n00:17:42.278 --> 00:17:43.940\nYou're a user, what do you care about?\n\n298\n00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.880\n&gt;&gt; I don't care about, I could also\ncare about whether it's full but\n\n299\n00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.820\nwhether it's good.\n\n300\n00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.370\n&gt;&gt; But you care about whether it's good,\nbut you influenced me.\n\n301\n00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:56.880\nYou're a user, you influence me.\n\n302\n00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.480\nI don't care about specific costs.\n\n303\n00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.870\nAnd now I'm gonna be really mean.\n\n304\n00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.790\nDo I actually care as to whether Meghan\n\n305\n00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.960\nhas had training on how to\nuse that coffee machine?\n\n306\n00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.620\nDo I care about whether Meghan\nscolds herself on that half\n\n307\n00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.470\nfrothy thing that gives me, you know?\n\n308\n00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.370\n[LAUGH] You know me,\ncome on Justin, you know me.\n\n309\n00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.035\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say no.\n\n310\n00:18:19.035 --> 00:18:24.112\n[LAUGH] But we're talking,\nwe're using this as a metaphor.\n\n311\n00:18:24.112 --> 00:18:24.818\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we are.\n\n312\n00:18:24.818 --> 00:18:28.080\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about these respective\ncustomer users relationships.\n\n313\n00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I would\n\n314\n00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.534\nsay no-\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't.\n\n315\n00:18:30.534 --> 00:18:35.040\n&gt;&gt; Your main goal is,\nwhat's the value am getting for my money?\n\n316\n00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.983\n&gt;&gt; Right, that exactly it.\n\n317\n00:18:36.983 --> 00:18:40.880\nAnd so as a customer, am interested\nin from a strategic perspective.\n\n318\n00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:46.290\nAm interested in getting value for money.\n\n319\n00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:51.260\nNow, I am interested in whether\nyou like your coffee or not,\n\n320\n00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.660\nbecause ultimately you're gonna influence\nme and I'm just gonna get this.\n\n321\n00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.989\nI know, we will all get that constantly\nif you can't stand this coffee.\n\n322\n00:18:58.989 --> 00:19:02.670\nI'm interested in what\nthe user's got to say.\n\n323\n00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:04.775\nNow I'm interested in\nthe user perspective.\n\n324\n00:19:04.775 --> 00:19:08.809\nBut as a customer, I'm really interested\nin whether I give value for money,\n\n325\n00:19:08.809 --> 00:19:10.990\nthat's what I'm interested in.\n\n326\n00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:14.050\nAnd as far as if we go back to\nthe iTel description of a service,\n\n327\n00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.250\nspecific costs and risks,\ndon't give me specific costs,\n\n328\n00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.480\ndon't give me a breakdown on\nthose costs I don't care.\n\n329\n00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.590\nAnd as far as the risks are concerned,\nthey're yours that the service providers,\n\n330\n00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.170\nthey're not mine,\nI shouldn't take ownership of those.\n\n331\n00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.480\nSo there's your customer and your user.\n\n332\n00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.750\nSo I mentioned the business\nrelationship management,\n\n333\n00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:34.561\nbecause that's what we're talking about,\ntalks to the customer.\n\n334\n00:19:37.146 --> 00:19:42.240\nBusiness relationship management has\na relationship with the customer.\n\n335\n00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.330\nBut, as we've just demonstrated,\n\n336\n00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:50.550\nit doesn't mean that we\nignore the user perspective.\n\n337\n00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.341\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's a common misconception with VRM.\n\n338\n00:19:52.341 --> 00:19:56.214\nWe think that VRM just\ntalks to the customer and\n\n339\n00:19:56.214 --> 00:20:01.785\nthe customers just interested in\nwhether you get a full cup or not.\n\n340\n00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:07.290\nBut that's not true because if\nJustin doesn't like his coffee and\n\n341\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.528\nI'm gonna hear about it.\n\n342\n00:20:09.528 --> 00:20:12.490\nSo VRM has to listen to then me,\n\n343\n00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:16.090\nmoaning about the fact that Justin's\nmoaning at me about his coffee.\n\n344\n00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:19.320\n&gt;&gt; So is this like a tug of war,\nwhere initially as a customer,\n\n345\n00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.360\nyou're paying money.\n\n346\n00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.580\nIs the cup full?\n\n347\n00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.480\nAnd you go, the cup is full to the top.\n\n348\n00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.450\nI got the best value for my money.\n\n349\n00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.744\nBut then you give it to me, and I'm like,\nyeah, but this coffee tastes nasty.\n\n350\n00:20:29.744 --> 00:20:35.787\nAnd my swaying your perception of value,\nthat the business relationship manager,\n\n351\n00:20:35.787 --> 00:20:39.530\nnow means to make sure is like,\neither mediated, or\n\n352\n00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:45.510\nit's addressed if that perception changes\nbased on my kind of influence over you.\n\n353\n00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.650\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the thing is this\nrelationship management is not going\n\n354\n00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:49.699\nto listen to 500 users.\n\n355\n00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.650\nAnd the other thing about users\nis that users tend to have a very\n\n356\n00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:57.740\nspecific perspective.\n\n357\n00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.720\nThey look at one element, and that's it.\n\n358\n00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.210\nWhereas the customer has, because they're\npaying, and they're generally in charge of\n\n359\n00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:08.520\nquite a number of users,\nthey have a more higher-level perspective.\n\n360\n00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:12.420\nSo we talk about being strategic,\nat the customer level.\n\n361\n00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:19.510\nAnd so the business relationship manager\nhas a strategic insight into the customer.\n\n362\n00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:23.830\nBut nevertheless they're\nstill going to listen to\n\n363\n00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:27.530\nwhat feedback I've got to give\nthem about your experience.\n\n364\n00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:31.250\nSo if you didn't like your coffee or\nmaybe it was too cold,\n\n365\n00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:35.119\nyou see, I'm gonna feed that back to\nthe business relationship manage unit.\n\n366\n00:21:35.119 --> 00:21:38.770\nThe business relationship manage,\nyou get five different customers say, hey,\n\n367\n00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.460\nwe've had some complaints about\nthe coffee being too cold,\n\n368\n00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:46.610\nthen that's something that the service\nprovider then needs to address.\n\n369\n00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:48.890\nBecause the coffee is\ncold across the board.\n\n370\n00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.449\nSo they're gonna have a very\nhigh level perspective.\n\n371\n00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.220\n&gt;&gt; Would all of that information\nabout user's perspectives, would\n\n372\n00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:01.300\nthat filter back through the customer and\nto the business relationship manager?\n\n373\n00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.430\nOr, I know they're not\ngonna listen to 500 users.\n\n374\n00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:08.372\nBut is it something where they\nmay take a sample of users and\n\n375\n00:22:08.372 --> 00:22:13.360\nbypass the customer in order to prevent\nmaybe some kind of a, like light or\n\n376\n00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.999\nbias that ends up being\nimplemented by the customer.\n\n377\n00:22:16.999 --> 00:22:20.809\n&gt;&gt; I liked what you said up to a point,\ncuz you said would they like to take\n\n378\n00:22:20.809 --> 00:22:24.650\na sample and then you said bypass,\nand I don't like the word bypass.\n\n379\n00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:28.370\nYou can't bypass the person that's\npaying the bill, we can't do that.\n\n380\n00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:33.630\nBut I do like what you said about taking\na sample representative sort of feel for\n\n381\n00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:34.880\nwhat's happening.\n\n382\n00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.160\nAnd yes, it's perfectly feasible for\n\n383\n00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.850\nbusiness relationship\nmanagement to do that.\n\n384\n00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:42.130\nBecause you see what we're\ndoing there is we are just so\n\n385\n00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.290\nfar always focused with business\nrelationship management,\n\n386\n00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:48.890\nit's just on the reactive side of\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n387\n00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:49.470\nAnd in fact,\n\n388\n00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.680\nthe majority of business relationship\nmanagement should be proactive.\n\n389\n00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.130\nWe haven't touch on that yet.\n\n390\n00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.440\nThis is relationship management.\n\n391\n00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.310\nWhere do you think they sit?\n\n392\n00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:03.480\nWhere do you think this person sits?\n\n393\n00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.740\n&gt;&gt; Wouldn't they sit in\nthe service integrator level?\n\n394\n00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:12.380\nBusiness, they're interfacing\nwith the customer, and,\n\n395\n00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.990\nbut are, let me ask a clarifying question.\n\n396\n00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:20.920\nAre they for one particular service\nprovider or are they interfacing for\n\n397\n00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.120\nmultiple service providers?\n\n398\n00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.650\n&gt;&gt; For multiple service\nproviders in this instance.\n\n399\n00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:26.340\n&gt;&gt; I would say they sit at\nthe service integrator level.\n\n400\n00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.070\n&gt;&gt; They sit with the customer.\n\n401\n00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.090\n&gt;&gt; That's not intuitive to me.\n\n402\n00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:30.954\nI'm not saying it's wrong.\n\n403\n00:23:30.954 --> 00:23:32.553\nObviously, you know and I don't, but\n\n404\n00:23:32.553 --> 00:23:35.561\nI would think that they would sit at\nthat level as kind of a bridge interface\n\n405\n00:23:35.561 --> 00:23:38.050\nbetween the respective service\nprovider and the customer.\n\n406\n00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.000\n&gt;&gt; They are.\n\n407\n00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.530\nThere, okay.\n\n408\n00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:43.057\nI'm gonna bring another\nanalogy into this one.\n\n409\n00:23:43.057 --> 00:23:47.565\nSo my VRM has to got to\nsit in with my customer\n\n410\n00:23:47.565 --> 00:23:52.343\nbecause my customer has\ngot to trust the VRM.\n\n411\n00:23:52.343 --> 00:23:56.938\nWe've gotta get to the truth as to\nwhere somebody values a service or not.\n\n412\n00:23:56.938 --> 00:24:02.537\nWhen was the the last time\nyou went out for a meal?\n\n413\n00:24:02.537 --> 00:24:07.048\n&gt;&gt; Jo it's been a long time,\nI'm a busy guy, let's say three weeks ago.\n\n414\n00:24:07.048 --> 00:24:09.405\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I was just about to-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n415\n00:24:09.405 --> 00:24:13.574\n&gt;&gt; I was getting ready there to just run.\n\n416\n00:24:13.574 --> 00:24:17.011\nYou said three weeks ago, okay and I'm\ntaking it that the waitress at some point\n\n417\n00:24:17.011 --> 00:24:20.105\nin time came up to you and said,\nis everything all right with your meal.\n\n418\n00:24:20.105 --> 00:24:21.076\n&gt;&gt; They did.\n\n419\n00:24:21.076 --> 00:24:21.866\n&gt;&gt; They did, right?\n\n420\n00:24:21.866 --> 00:24:27.149\nOkay, and you said yes probably,\nyeah, cuz everybody does.\n\n421\n00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:30.175\nWas everything really all\nright with your mail?\n\n422\n00:24:30.175 --> 00:24:36.489\n&gt;&gt; In that particular instance yes, there\nhave been times where I have said no.\n\n423\n00:24:36.489 --> 00:24:40.690\n&gt;&gt; Right, but for the most part, it's true\nto say that when a waitress comes up to\n\n424\n00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.428\nyou, says is everything\nall right with your meal,\n\n425\n00:24:43.428 --> 00:24:46.505\nyou generally got a mouthful\nof food at that time anyway.\n\n426\n00:24:46.505 --> 00:24:47.757\nBut you say, yes.\n\n427\n00:24:47.757 --> 00:24:48.754\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n428\n00:24:48.754 --> 00:24:52.682\n&gt;&gt; Even though maybe things aren't\nquite up to your standards or\n\n429\n00:24:52.682 --> 00:24:56.092\nmaybe they are not quite as\ngood as you like them to be.\n\n430\n00:24:56.092 --> 00:25:00.208\nAnd you're a little bit disappointed with\nthe service, you're still gonna say, yes.\n\n431\n00:25:00.208 --> 00:25:01.183\n&gt;&gt; For the most part.\n\n432\n00:25:01.183 --> 00:25:04.033\n&gt;&gt; Right, why do we do that?\n\n433\n00:25:04.033 --> 00:25:08.866\nCuz we don't want the hassle,\nit's as simple as that.\n\n434\n00:25:08.866 --> 00:25:12.059\nThis comes back to the business\nrelationship manager and\n\n435\n00:25:12.059 --> 00:25:15.060\nwhere should the business\nrelationship manager be?\n\n436\n00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.999\nLet me ask you a question Justin.\n\n437\n00:25:16.999 --> 00:25:18.500\nPut that drink down.\n\n438\n00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.103\n[LAUGH] Do you enjoy our discussions?\n\n439\n00:25:21.103 --> 00:25:26.061\n&gt;&gt; I do, sometimes I feel like\nI'm barely treading water but\n\n440\n00:25:26.061 --> 00:25:30.932\nI do because these are alternative\nperspectives right?\n\n441\n00:25:30.932 --> 00:25:34.073\nIt is-\n&gt;&gt; Are you lying to me Justin?\n\n442\n00:25:34.073 --> 00:25:35.691\n&gt;&gt; I am not lying to you.\n\n443\n00:25:35.691 --> 00:25:37.170\n&gt;&gt; How do I know?\n\n444\n00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:39.580\n&gt;&gt; I suspect that you took\na bunch of fax training,\n\n445\n00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.000\nyou're looking at\nthe micro-tics on my face.\n\n446\n00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.159\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And no.\n\n447\n00:25:44.159 --> 00:25:47.385\n&gt;&gt; Body language, eye contact,\nappropriate- [CROSSTALK]\n\n448\n00:25:47.385 --> 00:25:49.857\n&gt;&gt; The fact of the matter is, I don't.\n\n449\n00:25:49.857 --> 00:25:54.322\nAnd if I only just come and see you every\nnow and then, which is what you said to me\n\n450\n00:25:54.322 --> 00:25:57.719\nthat, [COUGH] that business\nrelationship manager will do.\n\n451\n00:25:57.719 --> 00:26:02.102\nIf they only come and see you every now\nand then, and we don't have a rapport,\n\n452\n00:26:02.102 --> 00:26:06.296\nthen it's just the same as that waitress\ncoming up to your table, right.\n\n453\n00:26:06.296 --> 00:26:08.454\nAnd say is everything all\nright with your meal?\n\n454\n00:26:08.454 --> 00:26:12.321\nAnd you're gonna turn around and\nsay, yeah, sure, everything is fine.\n\n455\n00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:17.701\nBecause unless, like Justin and I,\nwe work together on a regular basis.\n\n456\n00:26:17.701 --> 00:26:23.031\nAnd we know each other, so I know whether\nJustin is telling me the truth or not.\n\n457\n00:26:23.031 --> 00:26:25.221\nBut unless we work together\non a regular basis,\n\n458\n00:26:25.221 --> 00:26:27.147\nI don't believe a word he says by the way.\n\n459\n00:26:27.147 --> 00:26:29.870\nUnless we work together\non a regular basis,\n\n460\n00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:33.708\nthen you don't know whether\nsomeones telling you the truth.\n\n461\n00:26:33.708 --> 00:26:37.834\nAnd variably they will tell you\nwhat they want you to hear.\n\n462\n00:26:37.834 --> 00:26:42.560\nAnd this is why we say that the business\nrelationship manager should be in\n\n463\n00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.885\nwith the customer.\n\n464\n00:26:43.885 --> 00:26:45.999\nBuilding up that rapport and\n\n465\n00:26:45.999 --> 00:26:50.586\nfinding out exactly what\nthe customer thinks of IT services.\n\n466\n00:26:50.586 --> 00:26:54.030\nBusiness relationship management\nis not a role where you\n\n467\n00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:57.976\ncan afford to just dip into that\ncustomer environment every day,\n\n468\n00:26:57.976 --> 00:27:01.074\nI would then say is everything\nokay with your meal?\n\n469\n00:27:01.074 --> 00:27:05.156\nCuz the answer you're gonna\nget back is either yes, or\n\n470\n00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:08.883\nthe other time,\nthe other thing that people say,\n\n471\n00:27:08.883 --> 00:27:13.608\nthey say no actually,\nI absolutely hate it, it's terrible.\n\n472\n00:27:13.608 --> 00:27:17.612\nBecause you only ever complain about your\nmeal when things are really, really bad.\n\n473\n00:27:17.612 --> 00:27:22.995\nBut what the basis relationship manager\nreally wants is a mixture of both,\n\n474\n00:27:22.995 --> 00:27:25.312\nthey want to find out the truth.\n\n475\n00:27:25.312 --> 00:27:28.221\nAnd they can't turn around to\nthe customer and say, you lying to me?\n\n476\n00:27:28.221 --> 00:27:31.687\nI mean, I might have said that to him but\nyou know,\n\n477\n00:27:31.687 --> 00:27:34.178\nyou can't do that with a customer.\n\n478\n00:27:34.178 --> 00:27:38.066\nSo business relationship management\nit's gotta being with the customer and\n\n479\n00:27:38.066 --> 00:27:39.629\nJustin is smacking right now.\n\n480\n00:27:39.629 --> 00:27:44.097\n&gt;&gt; I was just, better mark that off\nthe things to do if I become a BIM.\n\n481\n00:27:44.097 --> 00:27:48.517\nI thought I was supposed to do that, but\nI mean this really makes sense, right.\n\n482\n00:27:48.517 --> 00:27:53.034\nI wanna take frequent samples to keep\ntrack of what's going on instead\n\n483\n00:27:53.034 --> 00:27:57.490\nwaiting this long, I mean this is\nnot necessarily applicable here.\n\n484\n00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:02.237\nThe higher sample rate I can take,\nthe more likely I have time to respond to\n\n485\n00:28:02.237 --> 00:28:05.850\nsmall issues instead of going\ndo you like it, I hate it.\n\n486\n00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:08.985\nWoah, the last time we talked,\nwhich was six months ago- [CROSSTALK]\n\n487\n00:28:08.985 --> 00:28:09.578\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n488\n00:28:09.578 --> 00:28:10.364\n&gt;&gt; You loved it.\n\n489\n00:28:10.364 --> 00:28:12.518\nYeah, but\nyou haven't been here in six months and\n\n490\n00:28:12.518 --> 00:28:14.116\nall of these things have been wrong.\n\n491\n00:28:14.116 --> 00:28:16.013\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's exactly it.\n\n492\n00:28:16.013 --> 00:28:19.317\nSo the BRM should be there with\nthe customer, building up a rapport and\n\n493\n00:28:19.317 --> 00:28:20.719\nbuilding up a relationship.\n\n494\n00:28:20.719 --> 00:28:24.196\nYou know quite often we find out\nthat things aren't going so well for\n\n495\n00:28:24.196 --> 00:28:27.247\ncustomer by overhearing\nconversations in the break room.\n\n496\n00:28:27.247 --> 00:28:30.421\nYou're not gonna find that\nout if you're not there.\n\n497\n00:28:30.421 --> 00:28:34.927\nAnd that brings me to the other parts,\nthe proactive part of BRM.\n\n498\n00:28:34.927 --> 00:28:38.283\nSo far we've been talking\nabout our existing services.\n\n499\n00:28:38.283 --> 00:28:42.117\n&gt;&gt; But you see what BRM is here to do\nis here to feedback to the service\n\n500\n00:28:42.117 --> 00:28:42.975\nintegrator.\n\n501\n00:28:42.975 --> 00:28:49.254\nAnd the service provider about future\nstrategies for the organization.\n\n502\n00:28:49.254 --> 00:28:53.951\nWe should be in a position as a service\nintegrator, as a service provider\n\n503\n00:28:53.951 --> 00:28:57.727\nwe should be in a position to\nbe able to say to our business.\n\n504\n00:28:57.727 --> 00:29:01.924\nHey look, I see that you're\nstruggling with a certain thing,\n\n505\n00:29:01.924 --> 00:29:03.515\nwith a certain aspect.\n\n506\n00:29:03.515 --> 00:29:08.859\nLooks to me like you would need something\na little bit more portable to do your job,\n\n507\n00:29:08.859 --> 00:29:10.881\nlet me see what I can do for you.\n\n508\n00:29:10.881 --> 00:29:16.087\nSo much, but I was gonna say the word\nbetter but that's not the right word.\n\n509\n00:29:16.087 --> 00:29:21.147\nIt adds much more value,\nif we can do that to our customers rather\n\n510\n00:29:21.147 --> 00:29:25.752\nthan we wait for our customer\nto say to us, I want a tablet.\n\n511\n00:29:25.752 --> 00:29:28.631\nBecause you see when a customer\ncomes to us and says,\n\n512\n00:29:28.631 --> 00:29:33.028\nwe need tablets then we've then gotta\ngo back to potential service providers.\n\n513\n00:29:33.028 --> 00:29:37.255\nWe might have to evaluate different\nservice providers to see which option is\n\n514\n00:29:37.255 --> 00:29:37.988\nbest for us.\n\n515\n00:29:37.988 --> 00:29:40.887\nAnd then we go back to the customer and\nwe say okay,\n\n516\n00:29:40.887 --> 00:29:45.258\nthis is the option that's available for\nyou, that could be three months.\n\n517\n00:29:45.258 --> 00:29:49.529\nThree months could have happened in\nthat point, by the time we've gone back.\n\n518\n00:29:49.529 --> 00:29:51.189\nWell, that doesn't make any sense.\n\n519\n00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:54.493\nSo much better for me to have looked and\nseen what Justin was doing, and\n\n520\n00:29:54.493 --> 00:29:58.146\nsaid, that thing could really do with\nsomething a little bit more portable.\n\n521\n00:29:58.146 --> 00:30:00.654\nLet me go and\nhave a word with our service providers.\n\n522\n00:30:00.654 --> 00:30:03.479\nLet's see what's available,\nand then, yeah,\n\n523\n00:30:03.479 --> 00:30:05.844\nit might take another two months, or so.\n\n524\n00:30:05.844 --> 00:30:09.603\nBut now in two months' time,\nJustin hasn't said anything to me yet.\n\n525\n00:30:09.603 --> 00:30:14.144\nAnd then in two months I can go to\nJustin and say, Justin, you know what,\n\n526\n00:30:14.144 --> 00:30:18.484\nI see you struggling with that\nl;laptop how about if i gave you this?\n\n527\n00:30:18.484 --> 00:30:19.928\nYou would perceive so\n\n528\n00:30:19.928 --> 00:30:25.225\nmuch more value in me being proactive than\nin you having to ask for something and\n\n529\n00:30:25.225 --> 00:30:29.573\nthen me not responding to you for\nthree months, wouldn't you?\n\n530\n00:30:29.573 --> 00:30:30.626\n&gt;&gt; I definitely would and\n\n531\n00:30:30.626 --> 00:30:33.237\nI think this comes back to\nhaving that high sample rate.\n\n532\n00:30:33.237 --> 00:30:37.539\nKeeping you kind of your finger in\nthe pulse of what's going on, whereas\n\n533\n00:30:37.539 --> 00:30:42.066\nnot only are you listening to things\nthat you need to fix, you're looking.\n\n534\n00:30:42.066 --> 00:30:44.300\nOkay, well maybe a tablet would help here.\n\n535\n00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:51.010\nMaybe a better network would help over in\nthis area, or whatever it may be, right.\n\n536\n00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:51.804\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n537\n00:30:51.804 --> 00:30:54.780\n&gt;&gt; And that makes sense, because if\nyou come to me and you're like, hey,\n\n538\n00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.293\nI noticed that these things,\nI'm trying to help you.\n\n539\n00:30:57.293 --> 00:31:00.409\nYou're solving a problem that I\ndidn't even know I had- [CROSSTALK]\n\n540\n00:31:00.409 --> 00:31:01.071\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n541\n00:31:01.071 --> 00:31:02.100\n&gt;&gt; Before it became a problem.\n\n542\n00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.447\n&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly.\n\n543\n00:31:03.447 --> 00:31:08.180\nAnd that's exactly what business\nrelationship management should be doing.\n\n544\n00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:12.101\nThey should be managing that\nrelationship with the business and\n\n545\n00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:15.889\nit should be an interactive\nrelationship with the business.\n\n546\n00:31:15.889 --> 00:31:18.246\nIt should not be a one way relationship.\n\n547\n00:31:18.246 --> 00:31:22.249\nAnd it should not exist\nbased purely on interviews.\n\n548\n00:31:22.249 --> 00:31:26.671\nIs everything all right with your meal,\nthat's not what the relationship is.\n\n549\n00:31:26.671 --> 00:31:29.745\nThat's not a relationship,\nthat's an interview.\n\n550\n00:31:29.745 --> 00:31:33.679\nAnd you know what, with that type\nof interview as we like to call it,\n\n551\n00:31:33.679 --> 00:31:37.352\nI don't know whether he's lying to me or\nnot, let's face it.\n\n552\n00:31:37.352 --> 00:31:40.729\nAnd this is Justin we're talking about,\nright?\n\n553\n00:31:40.729 --> 00:31:42.032\n&gt;&gt; I am not a good liar.\n\n554\n00:31:42.032 --> 00:31:43.118\nI do not feign emotions well.\n\n555\n00:31:43.118 --> 00:31:46.088\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe I'm lying about that.\n\n556\n00:31:46.088 --> 00:31:46.836\nWho knows, right?\n\n557\n00:31:46.836 --> 00:31:50.647\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, let's not go there.\n\n558\n00:31:50.647 --> 00:31:54.011\nOkay, well for now,\nI wanna really wrap this out for BRM,\n\n559\n00:31:54.011 --> 00:31:56.424\nunless you've got any other questions.\n\n560\n00:31:56.424 --> 00:32:00.122\nI'm sure there's gonna be a plethora\nof questions that crop up as we kind of\n\n561\n00:32:00.122 --> 00:32:01.776\nexplore these other processes.\n\n562\n00:32:01.776 --> 00:32:05.195\nI may come back to BRM,\nbecause I'm like these are related things.\n\n563\n00:32:05.195 --> 00:32:08.363\nBut for now, I think I'm pretty good.\n\n564\n00:32:08.363 --> 00:32:10.367\nWell, I think I'm pretty good.\n\n565\n00:32:10.367 --> 00:32:12.916\n[LAUGH] I don't know if I actually am,\nthough.\n\n566\n00:32:12.916 --> 00:32:16.973\n&gt;&gt; I'm not saying anything,\nI'm saying nothing at all.\n\n567\n00:32:16.973 --> 00:32:19.288\n&gt;&gt; But Jo,\nwhere are we actually gonna go from here?\n\n568\n00:32:19.288 --> 00:32:22.329\nWhat are the other processes\nthat are kinda coming up next?\n\n569\n00:32:22.329 --> 00:32:26.215\n&gt;&gt; Well, you mentioned the word plethora,\nthat's exactly what we've got.\n\n570\n00:32:26.215 --> 00:32:29.372\nBut what we're gonna do in our next\nepisode is we're gonna look at change\n\n571\n00:32:29.372 --> 00:32:30.003\nmanagement.\n\n572\n00:32:30.003 --> 00:32:33.529\nWe're going to look at release\nmanagement in our next episode.\n\n573\n00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:38.004\nWe like to combine those two together\nin one episode just purely because\n\n574\n00:32:38.004 --> 00:32:40.475\nthe synergy between them and the flow.\n\n575\n00:32:40.475 --> 00:32:42.755\nSo we'll take a look at\nthat when we come back.\n\n576\n00:32:42.755 --> 00:32:44.742\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell that sounds like a plan Jo.\n\n577\n00:32:44.742 --> 00:32:48.244\nI'm definitely looking forward to\nfinding out all the thing I don't know.\n\n578\n00:32:48.244 --> 00:32:52.813\nAnd then feeling good about myself when I\nactually go, hey that make sense to me.\n\n579\n00:32:52.813 --> 00:32:56.444\nSo definitely come on back, we've got\nmore SIAM Processes coming at you but\n\n580\n00:32:56.444 --> 00:32:58.782\nfor now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n581\n00:32:58.782 --> 00:33:01.862\nSo signing off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n582\n00:33:01.862 --> 00:33:02.683\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n583\n00:33:02.683 --> 00:33:04.896\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n584\n00:33:04.896 --> 00:33:10.917\n[MUSIC]\n\n585\n00:33:10.917 --> 00:33:14.067\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:07.650\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.564\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:15.340\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.894\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\n\n7\n00:00:16.894 --> 00:00:19.424\nwe're continuing on with\nour SIAM foundation series.\n\n8\n00:00:19.424 --> 00:00:23.141\nAnd well, we're gonna be looking\nat change and release management.\n\n9\n00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:25.115\nWell, change management and\nrelease management.\n\n10\n00:00:25.115 --> 00:00:28.447\nLet me make sure we know those\nare actually two separate processes.\n\n11\n00:00:28.447 --> 00:00:31.211\nAnd here to help us along in that\nvery endeavor is Miss Jo Peacock,\n\n12\n00:00:31.211 --> 00:00:32.383\nhow are you doing today Jo?\n\n13\n00:00:32.383 --> 00:00:34.647\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you,\nJustin, how are you?\n\n14\n00:00:34.647 --> 00:00:40.976\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well, as well, and so\nwe've combined these two things.\n\n15\n00:00:40.976 --> 00:00:44.269\nAnd I guess that's because they relate,\nour change management and\n\n16\n00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.863\nrelease management interrelated or\ndo they make sister group together.\n\n17\n00:00:47.863 --> 00:00:51.830\nOr are we just saying well,\nthese two things are processes and\n\n18\n00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.411\nwe now have about 15 minutes for reach.\n\n19\n00:00:56.864 --> 00:00:58.140\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI don't know what to say that really.\n\n20\n00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.226\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Do we have 15 minutes for reach?\n\n21\n00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.522\nI don't think we have 15 minutes for each.\n\n22\n00:01:02.522 --> 00:01:06.946\nWe like to combine them cuz it makes sense\nto combine them because depending on\n\n23\n00:01:06.946 --> 00:01:09.884\nthe scale, and\nit's gonna take some explaining.\n\n24\n00:01:09.884 --> 00:01:14.945\nBut depending on the scale change might\nthen evolve into release management.\n\n25\n00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:18.778\nMight, there's a might to this but\nthey are linked.\n\n26\n00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:21.983\nAnd so, we can't really separate them.\n\n27\n00:01:21.983 --> 00:01:25.451\nPut it this way, we can't have release\nmanagement without change management,\n\n28\n00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:26.731\nwe have to have change first.\n\n29\n00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:29.541\nBut we can have change management\nwithout release management.\n\n30\n00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:33.268\nSee, I told you it wasn't gonna\nbe that simple, didn't I?\n\n31\n00:01:33.268 --> 00:01:37.611\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Most of you can't see, but\nmost of the time when she says something.\n\n32\n00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:42.398\nAnd I get this real inquisitive look, I'm\ntrying to like, noodle around in my brain,\n\n33\n00:01:42.398 --> 00:01:43.985\nokay, change management.\n\n34\n00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:47.724\nHow could I not have release management\nbut I have a very particular bias?\n\n35\n00:01:47.724 --> 00:01:51.621\nI think that's part of the issue, is I\nhave a bias where I'm like, changes and\n\n36\n00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:52.692\nthen I have releases.\n\n37\n00:01:52.692 --> 00:01:55.201\nAnd that's based on my background,\nthat's not always the case.\n\n38\n00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:57.777\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but then you're asking\nthe questions that most people will\n\n39\n00:01:57.777 --> 00:01:58.289\nask anyway.\n\n40\n00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:05.371\nAnd that's really what’s important here\nis that I can answer a lot of questions.\n\n41\n00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:07.503\nOr I can try and\npre-empt a lot of questions but\n\n42\n00:02:07.503 --> 00:02:09.597\nI can't pre-empt absolutely everything.\n\n43\n00:02:09.597 --> 00:02:12.813\nAnd so you're answering the questions\nthat most people are answering,\n\n44\n00:02:12.813 --> 00:02:13.981\nthey're asking anyway.\n\n45\n00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:16.039\nSo I wouldn't worry too much about that.\n\n46\n00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:22.237\nChange management is about controlling\nchanges to our environment.\n\n47\n00:02:22.237 --> 00:02:26.181\nAnd what we've got to remember\nis that in this ecosystem,\n\n48\n00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:28.840\nthis is critically important.\n\n49\n00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.439\nBecause, can I use those two\nwords together, I'm going to.\n\n50\n00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.848\nBecause I wanna really highlight\nthe severity of this and\n\n51\n00:02:33.848 --> 00:02:35.364\nhighlight the importance of this.\n\n52\n00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:38.108\nChange management is critically important,\n\n53\n00:02:38.108 --> 00:02:42.550\nbecause change management controls\nchange to the customer environment.\n\n54\n00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.406\nLet's take a look at the purpose\nof change management.\n\n55\n00:02:45.406 --> 00:02:51.336\nIt's to ensure that changes are made\nwith minimal amounts of disruption.\n\n56\n00:02:51.336 --> 00:02:55.224\nAnd yes, we're kind of combined\nwith release management but\n\n57\n00:02:55.224 --> 00:02:57.627\nI'm gonna come on to that in a second.\n\n58\n00:02:57.627 --> 00:03:03.334\nSo change management is about ensuring\nthat the changes to the live environment.\n\n59\n00:03:03.334 --> 00:03:10.602\nThat a live customer environment have\nvery, very little negative impact.\n\n60\n00:03:10.602 --> 00:03:13.837\nAll right,\nI wanna put this in another way,\n\n61\n00:03:13.837 --> 00:03:17.785\nthat the impact to the live\nenvironment is positive.\n\n62\n00:03:17.785 --> 00:03:22.700\nAnd that the positive impact of any\nchange outweighs the negative impact of\n\n63\n00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.566\nany change.\n\n64\n00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:24.889\nDoes that make more sense?\n\n65\n00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.210\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense at an abstract level.\n\n66\n00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.674\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense based on my experiences,\n\n67\n00:03:32.674 --> 00:03:33.284\nright?\n\n68\n00:03:33.284 --> 00:03:37.293\nAs a developer you're like, okay,\nI'm trying to make this update, and\n\n69\n00:03:37.293 --> 00:03:40.668\nI'm getting a positive set of features or\nwhatever it may be.\n\n70\n00:03:40.668 --> 00:03:43.466\nBut I'm not taking down\nthe system in order to do that.\n\n71\n00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:44.572\n&gt;&gt; And that's exactly it,\n\n72\n00:03:44.572 --> 00:03:47.843\nwe've gotta make sure that positive\nimpact outweighs negative impact.\n\n73\n00:03:47.843 --> 00:03:51.287\nSo the feature that we're adding\nwill have a positive impact, but\n\n74\n00:03:51.287 --> 00:03:55.366\nwe don't wanna have a detrimental impact\non any of our other services as well.\n\n75\n00:03:55.366 --> 00:03:59.451\nThis is generally, and\nthe reason why change is so\n\n76\n00:03:59.451 --> 00:04:05.294\nimportant because this is generally\nwhere we realize, as a business.\n\n77\n00:04:05.294 --> 00:04:10.990\nThis is where we realize when things\nhaven't gone quite the way we planned it,\n\n78\n00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.978\nor this is when we realize\nthat we're in a bit of a mess.\n\n79\n00:04:14.978 --> 00:04:20.155\nIf we go back to some previous episodes,\nand right at the very beginning\n\n80\n00:04:20.155 --> 00:04:25.614\nof this particular series, we looked\nat why we would need SIAM ecosystem.\n\n81\n00:04:25.614 --> 00:04:29.796\nAnd one of the justifications for\nthe SIAM ecosystem is when we had\n\n82\n00:04:29.796 --> 00:04:34.357\na lot of customers, a lot of business\nunits that would be going directly\n\n83\n00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:39.314\nto supplies themselves directly to\nservice providers for whatever reason.\n\n84\n00:04:39.314 --> 00:04:43.054\nMaybe they didn't feel that internal\nIT was meeting their needs or\n\n85\n00:04:43.054 --> 00:04:46.213\nmaybe they didn't feel that\nIT was responsive enough.\n\n86\n00:04:46.213 --> 00:04:48.325\nWhatever those reasons may be,\n\n87\n00:04:48.325 --> 00:04:52.088\nbusiness units went directly\nto the service providers.\n\n88\n00:04:52.088 --> 00:04:57.678\nAnd it's generally because of fail\nchanges, that's what a drives\n\n89\n00:04:57.678 --> 00:05:03.082\na business to realize that we need\nto manage our services better.\n\n90\n00:05:03.082 --> 00:05:05.996\nBecause one business unit has\ngot a service provider and\n\n91\n00:05:05.996 --> 00:05:09.039\nthey have a relationship with\nthis one service provider.\n\n92\n00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.830\nAnd that one service provider made\na change to that application and\n\n93\n00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.888\nthen it effect did the whole\nentire infrastructure.\n\n94\n00:05:15.888 --> 00:05:21.763\nAnd that's why the business then said,\nwe can't have that happen again.\n\n95\n00:05:21.763 --> 00:05:23.992\nSo it's generally change.\n\n96\n00:05:23.992 --> 00:05:27.225\nIt's either that or it's an incident\nwhere something's gone wrong and\n\n97\n00:05:27.225 --> 00:05:30.300\nnobody wants to resolve it because\neverybody's pointing fingers.\n\n98\n00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.097\nThat's what tells the business\nthat something's got to happen.\n\n99\n00:05:34.097 --> 00:05:38.916\nWe've got to get more organized because\nwe've got so many suppliers now,\n\n100\n00:05:38.916 --> 00:05:41.913\nthat they're starting\nto impact each other.\n\n101\n00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:47.073\nSo it's really critical in this\nSIAM eco-structure that change\n\n102\n00:05:47.073 --> 00:05:52.435\nis managed efficiently and\neffectively, and that it's managed.\n\n103\n00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:55.643\nBecause if one service\nprovider makes a change here,\n\n104\n00:05:55.643 --> 00:05:58.863\nit will potentially affect\nabsolutely everything.\n\n105\n00:05:58.863 --> 00:06:03.820\nBut how come these particular service\nprovider here see what the impact will\n\n106\n00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.706\nbe if none of the other service providers\nat these levels will talk to them?\n\n107\n00:06:11.816 --> 00:06:12.953\nDoesn't happen, does it?\n\n108\n00:06:12.953 --> 00:06:15.038\nSo then just make the change, and\n\n109\n00:06:15.038 --> 00:06:20.105\nthat's when we realize that the impact\nis there, the negative impact is there.\n\n110\n00:06:20.105 --> 00:06:22.869\nSo this is why we need SIAM.\n\n111\n00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:27.397\nSo this is why, this is our justification,\nquite often, for that SIAM\n\n112\n00:06:27.397 --> 00:06:32.696\necostructure that says look, we've got\nto control all of our service providers.\n\n113\n00:06:32.696 --> 00:06:36.017\nAnd we've got to do this\nis a consistent manner.\n\n114\n00:06:36.017 --> 00:06:38.212\nThis is quite often the driver.\n\n115\n00:06:38.212 --> 00:06:45.178\nChange management is about ensuring that\nchange is made into the right environment.\n\n116\n00:06:45.178 --> 00:06:49.973\nAnd that's our customer environment\nin a controlled manner.\n\n117\n00:06:49.973 --> 00:06:56.172\nSo the change is assessed, it's evaluated.\n\n118\n00:06:56.172 --> 00:07:01.025\nIt's prioritized according to\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n119\n00:07:01.025 --> 00:07:06.381\nAnd then we are able to test and\n\n120\n00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:12.171\ndeploy in a controlled manner.\n\n121\n00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:16.947\nI said right at the very beginning that\nrelease and change probably won't gonna\n\n122\n00:07:16.947 --> 00:07:21.238\nget about 50%, 50-50 of the time\nin this particular episode.\n\n123\n00:07:21.238 --> 00:07:27.299\nBecause they're not release management\ncomes into play when we have medium and\n\n124\n00:07:27.299 --> 00:07:29.027\nlarge scale changes.\n\n125\n00:07:29.027 --> 00:07:34.712\nRelease management doesn't come into play\nfor small changes, small implementations.\n\n126\n00:07:34.712 --> 00:07:38.793\nSo for small implementations, like can\nI have a new laptop please, we wouldn't\n\n127\n00:07:38.793 --> 00:07:42.586\nnecessarily bring in release management\nfor one person with a new laptop.\n\n128\n00:07:42.586 --> 00:07:47.434\nBut if we had to deploy an entire suite of\nlaptops across the customer organization,\n\n129\n00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:51.138\nthen most definitely release\nmanagement would come into play.\n\n130\n00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:54.123\nSo change management is\nabout managing change.\n\n131\n00:07:54.123 --> 00:08:00.375\nThe importance here is to remember that\nchange management authorizes the change.\n\n132\n00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:05.640\nAnd once the change has been authorized,\nit's at that point in time when either\n\n133\n00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.670\nchange management carry on and then do\nthe bill test and implement, or it's\n\n134\n00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:16.470\nhanded over to release management, and\nthey then do the bill test and implement.\n\n135\n00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.520\nAnd it's all really down to the scale.\n\n136\n00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.490\nThe scale will tell you whether\nwe use release management, or\n\n137\n00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.480\nwhether we don't use release management.\n\n138\n00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.330\nUltimately we've got to manage\nevery single release, but\n\n139\n00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.370\nwhether we need form of process for\nthat or\n\n140\n00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:34.052\nnot, well, that's the scale it's\ngoing to help you to determine that.\n\n141\n00:08:34.052 --> 00:08:38.026\nBut obviously you're going\nto have guidelines for this.\n\n142\n00:08:38.026 --> 00:08:42.270\nYou're going to have guidelines that\nsays in this instance, we will do this.\n\n143\n00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.760\nIn this instance, we will do that,\n\n144\n00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.159\nwe will use change management\ninstead of release management.\n\n145\n00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:56.020\nSo change management's job is to manage\nchange across the entire ecosystem.\n\n146\n00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:00.890\nNot just one service provider but\nthe entire ecosystem.\n\n147\n00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:08.710\nHistorically, in a traditional, and\ngo back to one of our previous episodes,\n\n148\n00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:11.700\nand you will see what\na traditional structure looks like.\n\n149\n00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.236\nIn a traditional structure\nwith an IT service provider,\n\n150\n00:09:15.236 --> 00:09:19.730\nthen we might have a change advisory\nboard for one particular service and\n\n151\n00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:24.091\nanother one for another service and\nanother one for another service.\n\n152\n00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:30.376\nAnd whilst that worked well in that\ntraditional IT management methodology,\n\n153\n00:09:30.376 --> 00:09:37.061\nin an ecosystem, ecosystem,\nthat doesn't necessarily work so great.\n\n154\n00:09:37.061 --> 00:09:41.121\nBecause we have to bring in,\ninto our changed advisory board,\n\n155\n00:09:41.121 --> 00:09:44.110\nstakeholders from other service providers,\n\n156\n00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:48.800\nbecause other service providers,\nwell, they've gotta be involved.\n\n157\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.810\nThey have got to be able to raise\ntheir hands and say, great idea, but\n\n158\n00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.830\nwhat you're doing is actually\ngoing to affect me negatively.\n\n159\n00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.280\nOr, you know what?\n\n160\n00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.780\nYou want to implement that\nchange next Saturday, but\n\n161\n00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.930\nunfortunately next Saturday we've\ngot some major power outages\n\n162\n00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.130\nbecause we're testing our generators, and\ntherefore that's not going to work for us.\n\n163\n00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.400\nSo, change management is\nmore of a coordination role\n\n164\n00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.130\nas well as the management and\nthe authorization role.\n\n165\n00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.760\nDoes that make sense?\n\n166\n00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.481\n&gt;&gt; It does, it's one of those things were\nyou're like this will be not too bad and\n\n167\n00:10:24.481 --> 00:10:28.123\nthen you start thinking about all\nthe little idiosyncrasies and\n\n168\n00:10:28.123 --> 00:10:30.364\nthe nuances that you have to consider.\n\n169\n00:10:30.364 --> 00:10:34.318\nBecause if you a lot of the service\nproviders, it could just be,\n\n170\n00:10:34.318 --> 00:10:37.848\njust a constant barrage of\ncoordination requirements.\n\n171\n00:10:37.848 --> 00:10:39.560\nYou're like, we're gonna do this.\n\n172\n00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.580\nNo, I can't do that because that's\ngonna affect this service and\n\n173\n00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.450\nseems like they have a pretty hefty\njob that could have significant impact\n\n174\n00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.490\nto the organization as a whole, right?\n\n175\n00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.380\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\nwe want the impact to be positive.\n\n176\n00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.050\nWe don't want the impact to be negative,\nand\n\n177\n00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.060\nthat's the thing, we want to have\nan impact to the organization.\n\n178\n00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.346\nBut we want it to be positive\nimpact to the organization.\n\n179\n00:10:59.346 --> 00:11:03.930\nAnd that's difficult because, and\n\n180\n00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.340\nI'm gonna come back to what you\nsaid about, yeah, it all starts off\n\n181\n00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.830\nreally simple, and then you think about\nit a little bit more, and it's not.\n\n182\n00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:14.830\nBut when I talk about positive impact to\nthe organization, it can be difficult,\n\n183\n00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.730\nbecause traditionally,\n\n184\n00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.730\nour customer environment only ever\nsee IT when something goes wrong.\n\n185\n00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.540\nYou never notice IT when it's working,\ndo you?\n\n186\n00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:29.070\nYou open up your laptop,\nyou turn it on maybe, and\n\n187\n00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:33.260\nthen you just start typing,\nand you don't even notice it.\n\n188\n00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.010\nYou don't notice when you've got your\ncellphone in your pocket, do you?\n\n189\n00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:37.730\nYou don't notice it.\n\n190\n00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.283\nYou don't even know notice when it\ncomes to answering your cellphone, or\n\n191\n00:11:41.283 --> 00:11:44.917\nwhen it comes to checking your social\nmedia, you don't actually notice.\n\n192\n00:11:44.917 --> 00:11:48.120\nThe only time you notice\nIT is when it goes wrong.\n\n193\n00:11:49.858 --> 00:11:53.750\nAnd so there's a huge challenge to make\nsure that the positive impact outweighs\n\n194\n00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.630\nthe negative impact,\nbecause we only ever notice the negative.\n\n195\n00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.390\nWe don't really notice\nthe positive impact.\n\n196\n00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:02.960\nWhen was the last time you sat there and\nyou looked at your screen and\n\n197\n00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.715\nyou said, I'm so glad it does that.\n\n198\n00:12:04.715 --> 00:12:10.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, Jo,\nbased on my experience, even if\n\n199\n00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:14.580\nI'm not IT involved, even on my personal\nmachines, I rarely have that thought.\n\n200\n00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.018\nI'm like,\nman [LAUGH] I wish it would work.\n\n201\n00:12:18.018 --> 00:12:19.509\nHere's hoping.\n\n202\n00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:22.064\nBut actually if you're in\na corporate environment or\n\n203\n00:12:22.064 --> 00:12:26.438\nsome kinda large-scale environment where\nsomething is highly managed, you're right,\n\n204\n00:12:26.438 --> 00:12:29.920\nthere's a bunch going on behind\nthe scenes that just makes things work.\n\n205\n00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:35.302\nThat are hopefully being helpful\nto you in an ideal case.\n\n206\n00:12:35.302 --> 00:12:40.086\nBut you're not focused on those, it's when\nyou get a pop-up or hey, this crashed, or\n\n207\n00:12:40.086 --> 00:12:42.060\nhey, the network's down.\n\n208\n00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.180\nThose are the times when you go,\nI need to contact IT.\n\n209\n00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.107\nI need to find someone\nto fix this problem.\n\n210\n00:12:48.107 --> 00:12:52.634\nBut, really they have probably per-empted\na bunch of problems to begin with, and\n\n211\n00:12:52.634 --> 00:12:55.170\nsolve problems you didn't\neven know you had.\n\n212\n00:12:55.170 --> 00:13:00.421\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly and one of the struggles\nthat we have within IT is getting budget,\n\n213\n00:13:00.421 --> 00:13:05.850\nand getting budget for IT, and getting\nbudget for just the business as usual.\n\n214\n00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.859\nBecause a lot of the things that\nwe do as a service integrator and\n\n215\n00:13:09.859 --> 00:13:15.020\nas a service provider is to actually make\nsure that the service isn't impacted.\n\n216\n00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.557\nAnd of course that's when the customer\nturns around and says well,\n\n217\n00:13:17.557 --> 00:13:20.315\nwhy do we need problem management\nbecause we didn't have any problems?\n\n218\n00:13:20.315 --> 00:13:25.200\n[LAUGH] Well, no, no, you didn't have any\nproblems because we had problem management\n\n219\n00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.140\nand that's why you need\nproblem management.\n\n220\n00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.340\nAnd so this is really critical.\n\n221\n00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.428\nChange management, again it stands\nto customer perception, and\n\n222\n00:13:34.428 --> 00:13:38.881\nchange management, really their role\nis to ensure that positive impact\n\n223\n00:13:38.881 --> 00:13:40.925\noutweighs the negative impact,\n\n224\n00:13:40.925 --> 00:13:45.251\nbearing in mind that they might not\nactually see the positive impact.\n\n225\n00:13:45.251 --> 00:13:47.425\nI thought you were gonna say\nsomething there [CROSSTALK].\n\n226\n00:13:47.425 --> 00:13:51.091\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is always\none of those things, right,\n\n227\n00:13:51.091 --> 00:13:54.330\nwhere things are just thankless ventures.\n\n228\n00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.310\nIf you're on the other side of the fence,\nright, and\n\n229\n00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.680\nyou're part of that making\nsure everything works.\n\n230\n00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.722\nYou're like, I do all this work and then\nyou only call me for when things go wrong.\n\n231\n00:14:03.722 --> 00:14:05.817\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; Well, to some extent,\n\n232\n00:14:05.817 --> 00:14:08.510\nthere are jobs that that's\njust the case for, right?\n\n233\n00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:12.636\nYou are making sure things are positive,\nthings are working, and\n\n234\n00:14:12.636 --> 00:14:17.427\nI was just thinking back to some of the\ntimes I've done stuff where I did a bunch\n\n235\n00:14:17.427 --> 00:14:19.805\nhelp that people didn't recognize.\n\n236\n00:14:19.805 --> 00:14:23.130\nBut I definitely got a call\nwhen things went sideways.\n\n237\n00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:26.220\n&gt;&gt; Right, but then you say people\nonly call when something goes wrong.\n\n238\n00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.577\nBut then, you know what?\n\n239\n00:14:27.577 --> 00:14:30.827\nThe service desk probably send out\na survey every now and then to say hey,\n\n240\n00:14:30.827 --> 00:14:31.528\nhow is your IT?\n\n241\n00:14:31.528 --> 00:14:33.190\nIs everything okay?\n\n242\n00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:33.727\nAnd you know what?\n\n243\n00:14:33.727 --> 00:14:36.809\nThey'll ignore it, they won't reply\nto that survey because again,\n\n244\n00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:38.910\nthey'll only call when\nsomething goes wrong.\n\n245\n00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:44.340\nThey don't want to know when something is\na-okay, when something is going right.\n\n246\n00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:49.430\nSo change management is difficult to\njustify from a budgetary perspective, but\n\n247\n00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.270\nit's incredibly difficult to manage.\n\n248\n00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:55.400\n[COUGH] And of course when we're talking\nabout multiple service providers,\n\n249\n00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.860\nthen well, we don't just have\na single point of failure,\n\n250\n00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.060\nwe have multiple points of failure.\n\n251\n00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.240\nAnd that means risk management is, again,\n\n252\n00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.100\nI'll use the word critical\nto change management.\n\n253\n00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.670\nWe have to do risk evaluation, and\none of the risks that we would be\n\n254\n00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:17.360\nevaluating all the time with every\nsingle change is the risk of a service\n\n255\n00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.910\nprovider not being able to fulfill\ntheir particular requirements.\n\n256\n00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:27.490\nSo risk management and risk evaluation\nis key to change management.\n\n257\n00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:31.509\nAnd it's that acknowledgement that even\nthough they may be our favorite service\n\n258\n00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:34.121\nprovider, and\nwe don't want to call anybody that.\n\n259\n00:15:34.121 --> 00:15:38.473\nThe fact of the matter is that, if the\nrelationship doesn't work between them and\n\n260\n00:15:38.473 --> 00:15:42.570\nanother service provider,\nthen we've got a point of failure there.\n\n261\n00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.994\nAnd we've got to add in resilience,\nor maybe mitigated actions,\n\n262\n00:15:46.994 --> 00:15:50.076\nto ensure that that\nfailure doesn't happen.\n\n263\n00:15:50.076 --> 00:15:54.938\nChange management is complex enough\nin an environment where we've got\n\n264\n00:15:54.938 --> 00:15:59.799\none service provider, but\nin an environment where we've got multiple\n\n265\n00:15:59.799 --> 00:16:04.270\nservice providers, and\nwe have to manage those relationships.\n\n266\n00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:09.629\nIt is incredibly complex and incredibly\ndifficult to do, which brings me into\n\n267\n00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:15.380\nanother point to do with change\nmanagement, and that is the bureaucracy.\n\n268\n00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.010\nI know that I mentioned\nin previous episodes that\n\n269\n00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:22.150\nchange management is the most\nbypassed process within IT.\n\n270\n00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:27.560\nPeople perceive change management as\nbeing very, very bureaucratic and\n\n271\n00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.620\nhaving too many hoops to jump through\nin order to progress through the change\n\n272\n00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:36.850\nprocess, and\nto have that change process approved, and\n\n273\n00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:42.290\nthen to enable a release of whatever\nupdate it is that we want releasing.\n\n274\n00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:47.680\nIt can be, and again,\nI'm gonna go back to what\n\n275\n00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.750\nI've mentioned in previous\nepisodes about keeping it simple.\n\n276\n00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:55.690\nUsing models,\npredefined sets of steps, and\n\n277\n00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:01.110\npredefined sets of steps that have been,\nwhere possible automated.\n\n278\n00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:06.580\nAnd I mentioned where possible, because\nwe can't always automate everything.\n\n279\n00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:11.090\nAnd, in fact, we've always gotta make\nsure that we get our process right.\n\n280\n00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:14.520\nWe configure our process first and\nthen we look to automate.\n\n281\n00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.340\nYou don't like the sound of automation,\ndo you?\n\n282\n00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:21.530\n&gt;&gt; No, I absolutely love automation,\nautomation is kinda a hobby of mine.\n\n283\n00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.169\nI try to automate some of\nthose menial tasks in my life.\n\n284\n00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:25.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But maybe that's for\n\n285\n00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:26.930\na different discussion.\n\n286\n00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.030\n&gt;&gt; How successful was that, Justin?\n\n287\n00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.549\n&gt;&gt; It's not going too well, Jo.\n\n288\n00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:31.399\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n289\n00:17:31.399 --> 00:17:32.270\nyou brought up some bad memories.\n\n290\n00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.494\nBut, I was thinking based on what you\nsaid, we're being bypassed because it\n\n291\n00:17:35.494 --> 00:17:38.340\nseems like there's a lot of\nsteps that need to implement.\n\n292\n00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.730\nAnd I thought to a previous episode, and\n\n293\n00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.550\nI'm asking this question\nbecause I'm not entirely sure.\n\n294\n00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:50.080\nIf your change management process has this\nhigh likelihood of bypass, because of how\n\n295\n00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.720\nit's implemented, does that necessarily\nmean that it is not a mature process?\n\n296\n00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.330\nThat it needs to go through\nadditional maturation to\n\n297\n00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.720\nmake it more effective to\nmake it more efficient?\n\n298\n00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.191\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly what it means,\n\n299\n00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:05.939\nyeah if the process not being followed\nthen we can't consider it to be mature.\n\n300\n00:18:05.939 --> 00:18:10.758\nMature means, maturity is about how\nwell-developed it is to meet the needs of\n\n301\n00:18:10.758 --> 00:18:15.505\nthe organisation, and if the needs of\nthe organisation offer something more\n\n302\n00:18:15.505 --> 00:18:18.877\nefficient, then changed\nprocess is being bypassed.\n\n303\n00:18:18.877 --> 00:18:22.430\nIt's quite simply not efficient enough,\nit's not meeting their needs.\n\n304\n00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:29.566\nIf a process is being bypassed, then it's\nsimply not doing what it's supposed to do.\n\n305\n00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:34.395\nAnd quite often, I've seen IT people,\nI've seen IT departments say, well,\n\n306\n00:18:34.395 --> 00:18:37.930\nit's because the users\nwon't follow the process.\n\n307\n00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:41.230\nIf they see a benefit to a process,\nthey will follow it,\n\n308\n00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:46.350\nif they don't see any benefits to that,\nthen they don't going to follow it.\n\n309\n00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:51.720\nSo, if the uses aren't following a process\nit's because they don't perceive benefit,\n\n310\n00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.810\nbecause you have an answer to\nquestion what's in it for me?\n\n311\n00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:59.330\nAnd you haven't made it beneficial to\nthem, so, if it's too bureaucratic,\n\n312\n00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:00.800\nthey will bypass it.\n\n313\n00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.580\nAnd no, it's not mature, mature doesn't\nmean that it's been written down.\n\n314\n00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.780\nMature means that is well-developed to\nmeet the needs of the organization.\n\n315\n00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:13.750\nAnd so, therefore, if it's being bypassed\nit's clearly not well-developed,\n\n316\n00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.822\nit's clearly not meeting the needs.\n\n317\n00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:18.510\nSo no, we don't want people\nto bypass the processes,\n\n318\n00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.690\nwe want efficient processes\nthat people will follow,\n\n319\n00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:25.270\nespecially we're in this\nmulti-service provider environment.\n\n320\n00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:32.240\nIf the processes aren't followed then\nyou've got chaos, simply just fails.\n\n321\n00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.860\nAnd so that brings me into release\nmanagement, and release management is\n\n322\n00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:41.880\nthe bill's test and deployment of\nany changes or multiple changes.\n\n323\n00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:47.600\nChanges that, think about the scale, have\na large-scale impact on the environment.\n\n324\n00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:53.160\nNow, if I think about a release,\na release can be more than one change.\n\n325\n00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.890\nQuite often we bundle those\nchanges together, and\n\n326\n00:19:55.890 --> 00:20:00.380\nwe release at one point in time,\nyou don't want to release every week.\n\n327\n00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.860\nThat's another danger when you're in\na multiple service environment or\n\n328\n00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:08.040\nmultiple service provider environment, is\nthat you've got this service provider has\n\n329\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:13.280\ncreated a change for this week, and\nthis service providers created change for\n\n330\n00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.680\nthis week, and\nthis one's created a change for next week.\n\n331\n00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:21.596\nAnd so we don't want to keep releasing\ninto the live environment every\n\n332\n00:20:21.596 --> 00:20:22.606\nsingle week.\n\n333\n00:20:22.606 --> 00:20:26.630\nI mean, I don't know about you, but when I\nget updates on my cell phone or my laptop,\n\n334\n00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:30.450\nif I'm getting them more than once a week\nI'm getting fed up with that, right?\n\n335\n00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:36.071\n&gt;&gt; There can be,\nit doesn't bother me too much if it\n\n336\n00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:39.866\ndoes not affect my other usage, right?\n\n337\n00:20:39.866 --> 00:20:44.561\nIf I'm getting updates every week, every\nother day, that are saying, you need to\n\n338\n00:20:44.561 --> 00:20:49.130\nrestart your computer, or your cell phone\nkind of bogs down, or it's sapping a bunch\n\n339\n00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:53.840\nof bandwidth, or whatever it may be,\nthen that's affecting my use case.\n\n340\n00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.350\nAnd so if you have a whole bunch of, let's\nsay apps or whatever it maybe, that's kind\n\n341\n00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:02.290\nof a bunch of a service providers\nthat if they all do that, then and\n\n342\n00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:07.480\nthey're not stuck together toward it cause\na minimal impact and at short of duration,\n\n343\n00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.760\nthen you just get that constantly,\nand it becomes incredibly frustrating.\n\n344\n00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.910\n&gt;&gt; And that's why release management's\nrole to coordinate all of those releases,\n\n345\n00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.570\nespecially when we're talking\nabout cross-service providers.\n\n346\n00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.400\nWe've got to get that coordinated, and\n\n347\n00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.830\nwe've got to ensure that we have\nthe appropriate release windows.\n\n348\n00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:30.600\nWe're delivering value to the customer,\nthis is not about what we want to do,\n\n349\n00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.087\nit's not even about what\nthe service integrator wants.\n\n350\n00:21:34.087 --> 00:21:38.196\nThis is about delivering value to\nthe customer, and sometimes customers will\n\n351\n00:21:38.196 --> 00:21:41.370\njust simply say to us,\nwe want to release every two months and\n\n352\n00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:46.860\nwe don't want anything more, and that's\nexactly what release management's job is.\n\n353\n00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:52.740\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm trying to make sure I have all\nthis kind of wrapped up in my head here.\n\n354\n00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:58.246\nSo change management is used to\nmanage changes that are happening,\n\n355\n00:21:58.246 --> 00:22:02.205\nbut if I have a large to\nmedium scale deployment or\n\n356\n00:22:02.205 --> 00:22:07.227\nchange that needs to be released,\nthen release management is\n\n357\n00:22:07.227 --> 00:22:13.330\ngoing to manage the time-scale or\nat least the frequency that best suits.\n\n358\n00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.443\nKind of bundling all of the things\nthat have happened and saying,\n\n359\n00:22:16.443 --> 00:22:20.670\nokay now we're gonna push those live,\nand now we're gonna push those life.\n\n360\n00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:26.156\nAnd if we do that, then ideally\nwe should minimize disruption for\n\n361\n00:22:26.156 --> 00:22:32.156\nthese medium to large changes,\nI'm kind of talking in circles there.\n\n362\n00:22:32.156 --> 00:22:37.161\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wouldn't worry, we have got\nwhole courses that look at change and\n\n363\n00:22:37.161 --> 00:22:41.929\nrelease management in the SIAM ecosystem,\nbecause it doesn't matter\n\n364\n00:22:41.929 --> 00:22:47.240\nhow simple we try and make it sound,\nit's not actually as simple as it is.\n\n365\n00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:51.440\nBecause we haven't even started to talk\nabout things like release mechanisms,\n\n366\n00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.730\nsort of big bang releases,\nthings like your virus protection,\n\n367\n00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:59.150\nthat's got to be released across all of\nthe environment, all at the same time, but\n\n368\n00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:01.610\nacross all of the service\nproviders as well.\n\n369\n00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:04.960\nSo you're talking about releases\nin multiple environments, or\n\n370\n00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.481\nmaybe fazed approaches, but\n\n371\n00:23:06.481 --> 00:23:10.450\nfazed approaches could then interact\nwith somebody else's release, and\n\n372\n00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:14.190\ntherefore that could have a negative\nimpact and we don't want to do that.\n\n373\n00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.520\nAnd they you've got automated releases,\nand manual releases,\n\n374\n00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:22.180\nand we've got a whole platter of\nreleased types that we haven't\n\n375\n00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:25.781\neven scratch the surface of change and\nrelease management.\n\n376\n00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:29.020\n&gt;&gt; Well, that kinda makes me feel good and\n\n377\n00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.210\nit kind of justifies\nsome of the questions.\n\n378\n00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:37.420\nFollow up question to release management,\nI know we said this earlier,\n\n379\n00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:42.240\nbut they have to work closely\nwith change management, right?\n\n380\n00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:47.780\nIn order to determine, what's going to\nbe released in these release cycles,\n\n381\n00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.780\nor, let me better word my question there.\n\n382\n00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.805\n&gt;&gt; Well, there is no release\nwithout change management,\n\n383\n00:23:52.805 --> 00:23:53.888\nis that what you're saying?\n\n384\n00:23:53.888 --> 00:23:56.577\n&gt;&gt; And that makes sense,\nbut how do they determine?\n\n385\n00:23:56.577 --> 00:23:59.445\nSo let's say there's a bunch of changes\nthat has been going on, right, or\n\n386\n00:23:59.445 --> 00:24:00.821\nchanges that have been requested.\n\n387\n00:24:00.821 --> 00:24:01.431\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n388\n00:24:01.431 --> 00:24:02.908\n&gt;&gt; And blah blah blah.\n\n389\n00:24:02.908 --> 00:24:08.991\nIs that then passed from change management\nto release management if it's large scale?\n\n390\n00:24:08.991 --> 00:24:13.898\nOr is release management always kind of\nlurking in the shadows going, all right,\n\n391\n00:24:13.898 --> 00:24:14.903\nit that big one?\n\n392\n00:24:14.903 --> 00:24:17.193\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or is there some kind of, cuz you said,\n\n393\n00:24:17.193 --> 00:24:19.231\nthe customer say,\nI wanna release every two months.\n\n394\n00:24:19.231 --> 00:24:19.944\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n395\n00:24:19.944 --> 00:24:22.632\n&gt;&gt; Is there some presupposed schedule and\nthen okay,\n\n396\n00:24:22.632 --> 00:24:26.195\nwe have these large releases that\nare coming up on release time, and\n\n397\n00:24:26.195 --> 00:24:28.898\nnow we are making a plan,\nor is it just all of those?\n\n398\n00:24:28.898 --> 00:24:30.138\n&gt;&gt; Right, you're doing,\n\n399\n00:24:30.138 --> 00:24:33.158\nyou're falling into the trap\nthat a lot of people fall into.\n\n400\n00:24:33.158 --> 00:24:36.529\nYou're thinking of these\nas individual people.\n\n401\n00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:39.041\n&gt;&gt; Or groups of people.\n\n402\n00:24:39.041 --> 00:24:40.884\n&gt;&gt; Right, they are not.\n\n403\n00:24:40.884 --> 00:24:48.046\nA process is a set of activities,\nit's just something that somebody does.\n\n404\n00:24:48.046 --> 00:24:51.786\nSo think of it like this,\nI've got a change and it's being raised.\n\n405\n00:24:51.786 --> 00:24:53.671\nAnd it's gone to the change\nadvisory board and\n\n406\n00:24:53.671 --> 00:24:55.422\nwe're all sitting around discussing it.\n\n407\n00:24:55.422 --> 00:24:59.699\nAnd we look at this, and we say okay,\nthen yeah, this seems fine.\n\n408\n00:24:59.699 --> 00:25:03.523\nDo we need a formal release, yes or no?\n\n409\n00:25:03.523 --> 00:25:06.392\nAnd if we do,\nif it needs to be formally released, or\n\n410\n00:25:06.392 --> 00:25:08.495\ncan we just give it to that one person?\n\n411\n00:25:08.495 --> 00:25:12.885\nIf it needs to be formally released,\nokay then we get this piece of paper, and\n\n412\n00:25:12.885 --> 00:25:16.140\nthis is the process we follow\nif we need a formal release.\n\n413\n00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:20.027\nBut if we don't need a formal release,\nwell okay, then we'll follow this process.\n\n414\n00:25:20.027 --> 00:25:24.788\nSo think of these in terms of sets\nof activities rather than in terms\n\n415\n00:25:24.788 --> 00:25:26.326\nof groups of people.\n\n416\n00:25:26.326 --> 00:25:31.225\nBecause every single release, every single\nchange, is going to be undertaken by\n\n417\n00:25:31.225 --> 00:25:35.282\nsomebody completely different,\ndepending on what the change is.\n\n418\n00:25:35.282 --> 00:25:40.511\nSo if it's a change on email then maybe\nMicrosoft performing that changed and\n\n419\n00:25:40.511 --> 00:25:41.643\nthat released.\n\n420\n00:25:41.643 --> 00:25:45.612\nAnd what if it's a change to financial\nsystems then maybe all were clueless, then\n\n421\n00:25:45.612 --> 00:25:49.483\npay would be performing that particular\nchanged and that particular release.\n\n422\n00:25:49.483 --> 00:25:53.336\nBut we're gonna have to have input\nfrom our infrastructure to people for\n\n423\n00:25:53.336 --> 00:25:55.041\nboth of those types of changes or\n\n424\n00:25:55.041 --> 00:25:59.477\nreleases because obviously the changes\nyou're gonna set on the infrastructure.\n\n425\n00:25:59.477 --> 00:26:03.676\nAnd because the article release requires a\ncertain service pack on Windows that we're\n\n426\n00:26:03.676 --> 00:26:05.869\ngonna get Microsoft\ninvolve in that as well.\n\n427\n00:26:05.869 --> 00:26:08.238\nI told you,\nwe could talk about this for days.\n\n428\n00:26:10.414 --> 00:26:11.784\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure, Candice.\n\n429\n00:26:11.784 --> 00:26:15.154\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can just blew my mind, because,\n\n430\n00:26:15.154 --> 00:26:16.371\nI don't know.\n\n431\n00:26:16.371 --> 00:26:20.088\nI have feeling a little bit trap,\nright, think about this as people or\n\n432\n00:26:20.088 --> 00:26:21.099\na group of people.\n\n433\n00:26:21.099 --> 00:26:22.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Who are managing\n\n434\n00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.600\nthe respective processes but\nit could just be the same person or\n\n435\n00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.621\ndifferent people depending on the context\nof what being changed and released.\n\n436\n00:26:29.621 --> 00:26:31.746\nSo that helps clear that up but\n\n437\n00:26:31.746 --> 00:26:36.345\nthere is all this like interdependent\nlike audio synchronize.\n\n438\n00:26:36.345 --> 00:26:38.725\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like we need to make a change but\n\n439\n00:26:38.725 --> 00:26:42.605\nwe need to submit a change to Microsoft\nbecause this need to be updated.\n\n440\n00:26:42.605 --> 00:26:45.216\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Then we need to coordinate with that\n\n441\n00:26:45.216 --> 00:26:49.169\nrelease schedule, Jo- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And now you've started to get there.\n\n442\n00:26:49.169 --> 00:26:52.538\n&gt;&gt; Every time, I'm like I got it,\nno I don't got it.\n\n443\n00:26:52.538 --> 00:26:53.815\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n444\n00:26:53.815 --> 00:26:55.297\nit does take a lot of planning.\n\n445\n00:26:55.297 --> 00:27:00.085\nI think it highlights some of the\ndifficulties that you're going to have if\n\n446\n00:27:00.085 --> 00:27:01.606\nyou're in a business.\n\n447\n00:27:01.606 --> 00:27:04.075\nThey have a lot of external providers, and\n\n448\n00:27:04.075 --> 00:27:06.895\nyou have a lot of management\nthat needs to occur.\n\n449\n00:27:06.895 --> 00:27:10.908\n&gt;&gt; The other thing I wanna mention is that\nif you are in a position where you're\n\n450\n00:27:10.908 --> 00:27:12.692\nimplementing a SIAM ecosystem,\n\n451\n00:27:12.692 --> 00:27:16.530\nthen invariably you're in a business\nwhere we've got a lot of supply.\n\n452\n00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:19.231\nInvariably this is not\ngoing to be a small task,\n\n453\n00:27:19.231 --> 00:27:21.668\nthis is not gonna be a small organization.\n\n454\n00:27:21.668 --> 00:27:26.430\nI mentioned right at the very start in our\nfirst episode where we looked at Siam.\n\n455\n00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:30.926\nAnd I said, Siam can be applied to small\norganizations where we're going outside.\n\n456\n00:27:30.926 --> 00:27:35.286\nAnd we've got one external contractor\nthat we use that our system integrator,\n\n457\n00:27:35.286 --> 00:27:40.052\nservice integrator, then we have multiple,\nthey have multiple service providers.\n\n458\n00:27:40.052 --> 00:27:44.610\nBut ultimately the organization\nis quite small in that instance.\n\n459\n00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:47.149\nBut we still got to do the same thing, but\n\n460\n00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:51.347\ninvariably this SIAM ecosystem\nis used in larger organizations.\n\n461\n00:27:51.347 --> 00:27:57.043\nWell actually, this in the complexity\nof this, in managing the relationships,\n\n462\n00:27:57.043 --> 00:28:00.438\nit's not a simple task,\neven just mapping out.\n\n463\n00:28:00.438 --> 00:28:05.131\nI have tried to sit with organizations and\nmap out their relationships before.\n\n464\n00:28:05.131 --> 00:28:08.180\nAnd I can tell you now that I used up,\n\n465\n00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:12.675\n[LAUGH] we had in one room we had roll and\nwhiteboards.\n\n466\n00:28:12.675 --> 00:28:15.314\nAnd I used up ten whiteboards, and\n\n467\n00:28:15.314 --> 00:28:20.959\nI hadn't even got halfway through\nthe processes and the relationships.\n\n468\n00:28:20.959 --> 00:28:23.725\n&gt;&gt; Joe, that makes me afraid.\n\n469\n00:28:23.725 --> 00:28:25.435\n&gt;&gt; I have pictures!\n\n470\n00:28:25.435 --> 00:28:29.749\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But I can see right, there's\n\n471\n00:28:29.749 --> 00:28:35.320\nkinda this explosion because- Let's\ntake three external service providers.\n\n472\n00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:40.729\nIf it was something that simple, well,\nevery time you have to reevaluate,\n\n473\n00:28:40.729 --> 00:28:46.149\nokay, is the change that I'm making here,\ndoes it depend on changes here?\n\n474\n00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:49.993\nAre these always interdependent, or is it\nonly for these certain types of things?\n\n475\n00:28:49.993 --> 00:28:53.739\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm getting winded Jo, and kinda dizzy.\n\n476\n00:28:53.739 --> 00:28:56.516\n&gt;&gt; I think you need caffeine,\nI think that's what you need.\n\n477\n00:28:56.516 --> 00:28:57.344\n&gt;&gt; It is possible.\n\n478\n00:28:57.344 --> 00:28:58.721\n&gt;&gt; Now's a good time, right?\n\n479\n00:28:58.721 --> 00:29:02.344\n&gt;&gt; So, Jo, we've talked about\nchange of release management,\n\n480\n00:29:02.344 --> 00:29:04.167\nkind of how they're related.\n\n481\n00:29:04.167 --> 00:29:06.030\nAnd how not to think about them,\n\n482\n00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:09.214\nI think that's just as\nimportant about what they are.\n\n483\n00:29:09.214 --> 00:29:12.723\nWhere we're really going to go from here?\n\n484\n00:29:12.723 --> 00:29:16.342\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, in our next episode we're\ngonna take a look at contract management.\n\n485\n00:29:16.342 --> 00:29:20.386\nAnd we're also gonna take a look at\ncontinual service improvement as well.\n\n486\n00:29:20.386 --> 00:29:24.907\nSo that one's gonna be\nan interesting one and I enjoy CSI.\n\n487\n00:29:24.907 --> 00:29:29.908\nYeah, this is gonna be CSI SIAM,\nit could well be.\n\n488\n00:29:29.908 --> 00:29:32.605\nIt could be CSI Gainesville as well\nif you could see the look on his face\n\n489\n00:29:32.605 --> 00:29:33.174\nright there.\n\n490\n00:29:33.174 --> 00:29:34.162\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yep, so\n\n491\n00:29:34.162 --> 00:29:36.719\nwe've got that to look forward\nto in the next episode.\n\n492\n00:29:36.719 --> 00:29:38.938\n&gt;&gt; Well Jo, I keep learning more and more.\n\n493\n00:29:38.938 --> 00:29:42.016\nI do enjoy learning, and\nhopefully you do as well.\n\n494\n00:29:42.016 --> 00:29:45.503\nAnd well, we're just starting, getting\nstarted with these SIAM processes, so\n\n495\n00:29:45.503 --> 00:29:46.726\ndefinitely join us on back.\n\n496\n00:29:46.726 --> 00:29:48.411\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n497\n00:29:48.411 --> 00:29:51.693\nSo signing off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennisson.\n\n498\n00:29:51.693 --> 00:29:52.761\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n499\n00:29:52.761 --> 00:29:53.525\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n500\n00:29:53.525 --> 00:30:01.120\n[MUSIC]\n\n501\n00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.815\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:11.841\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:16.100\n&gt;&gt; Greetings, everyone and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.993\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\nwe're continuing on with SIAM Foundation.\n\n6\n00:00:18.993 --> 00:00:22.770\nAnd well,\nwe're still looking at SIAM processes.\n\n7\n00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.742\nWe're just now getting all started,\nin all honesty.\n\n8\n00:00:24.742 --> 00:00:27.685\nBut we're gonna be looking at\ncontract management in CSI.\n\n9\n00:00:27.685 --> 00:00:29.741\nAnd here to help as along\nis Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:29.741 --> 00:00:30.709\nHow you doing today, Jo?\n\n11\n00:00:30.709 --> 00:00:32.202\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm slightly worried now.\n\n12\n00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:35.348\nI was kind of very despondent,\nwe're still looking at SIAM.\n\n13\n00:00:35.348 --> 00:00:37.862\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; If that happened,\n\n14\n00:00:37.862 --> 00:00:40.011\nit was totally unintentional.\n\n15\n00:00:40.011 --> 00:00:41.731\nThat was not intentional.\n\n16\n00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:46.487\nBecause there's a lot of processes\nthat we have to consider, well,\n\n17\n00:00:46.487 --> 00:00:48.786\nfor the SIAM ecosystem, right?\n\n18\n00:00:48.786 --> 00:00:52.106\nAnd contract management,\nthat make sense to me.\n\n19\n00:00:52.106 --> 00:00:56.346\nCSI, there's another one of those\nthree letter acronyms again.\n\n20\n00:00:56.346 --> 00:00:59.030\nLet's make sure that we're all\non the same page with that.\n\n21\n00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.329\n&gt;&gt; Well it depends what page you're\non to be perfectly honest, Justin.\n\n22\n00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.886\nThat could have all sorts of meanings,\nyes.\n\n23\n00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:07.395\nIt could in here anyway.\n\n24\n00:01:07.395 --> 00:01:12.334\nCSI actually stands for\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n25\n00:01:12.334 --> 00:01:14.718\nAnd now it is time for my pop quiz.\n\n26\n00:01:14.718 --> 00:01:18.267\nAnd the difference between continual and\ncontinuous is?\n\n27\n00:01:18.267 --> 00:01:23.187\n&gt;&gt; Continuous is like the wheel rolling\nand continual is like iterative,\n\n28\n00:01:23.187 --> 00:01:26.961\nshort burst that we re-evaluate and\nmove forward on.\n\n29\n00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:29.131\nOr did I get those backwards?\n\n30\n00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:30.524\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, you got it right.\n\n31\n00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:34.201\nBut if you're gonna use that analogy,\nthen use it all the way, right?\n\n32\n00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:38.112\nYeah, one of them's like the wheel\nrolling and the other one's like walking.\n\n33\n00:01:38.112 --> 00:01:43.943\nYeah, it's the different between\nwalking and driving, simple.\n\n34\n00:01:43.943 --> 00:01:48.471\nSo [LAUGH] we talk about continuous\nservice improvement because we want\n\n35\n00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:50.936\niterative repeatable improvement.\n\n36\n00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:52.614\nAnd we'll take a look at\nthat in a little while.\n\n37\n00:01:52.614 --> 00:01:56.309\nBut the first thing I'm gonna do\nis talk about contract management.\n\n38\n00:01:56.309 --> 00:02:01.121\nContract management, well, that's gonna\nbe incredibly important, isn't it?\n\n39\n00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:04.841\nDepending on whether you\nhave got an internal or\n\n40\n00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:09.677\nan external service integrator\nthen there maybe a contract in\n\n41\n00:02:09.677 --> 00:02:14.146\nplace between the customer and\nthe service integrator.\n\n42\n00:02:14.146 --> 00:02:18.255\nBut whether your service integrator\nis internal or external,\n\n43\n00:02:18.255 --> 00:02:21.589\nthere are going to be\nmultiple contracts that exist\n\n44\n00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:25.477\nbetween the service integrator and\nthe service provider.\n\n45\n00:02:25.477 --> 00:02:31.591\nAnd so this is where we start talking\nabout the entire life of a contract.\n\n46\n00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:36.851\nAnd also negotiating service level targets\nand ensuring that service level targets\n\n47\n00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:41.973\nwill support the service level targets\nwithin the service level agreement.\n\n48\n00:02:41.973 --> 00:02:46.672\nWow, I could just throw some acronyms at\nyou right now if I wanted to cuz I know\n\n49\n00:02:46.672 --> 00:02:48.958\nhow Justin likes acronyms, right?\n\n50\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.205\n&gt;&gt; I do love a good acronym,\nit is always fun to,\n\n51\n00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:56.314\nI like to make things up when\nsomeone tells me an acronym.\n\n52\n00:02:56.314 --> 00:03:00.584\nCSI is a nice one because\nit has some previous, and\n\n53\n00:03:00.584 --> 00:03:04.256\nit has some more pop\nculture kind of thing.\n\n54\n00:03:04.256 --> 00:03:06.080\n&gt;&gt; I don't think I wanted to know,\nyeah, let's stop.\n\n55\n00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.552\n&gt;&gt; But we're gonna stay away from that,\n\n56\n00:03:08.552 --> 00:03:12.348\nI've heard of service level agreements,\nSLAs, right?\n\n57\n00:03:12.348 --> 00:03:13.305\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.\n\n58\n00:03:13.305 --> 00:03:15.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I was like, no, I got it wrong.\n\n59\n00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.608\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was impressed.\n\n60\n00:03:16.608 --> 00:03:20.715\nYeah, and SLA and\nwe've got operational level agreements and\n\n61\n00:03:20.715 --> 00:03:25.536\nwe've got service level targets and\nwe've got underpinning contract.\n\n62\n00:03:25.536 --> 00:03:32.950\nYeah, we've got a few, SLAs,\nOLAs, UTs, SLTs, yeah.\n\n63\n00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.749\nSlam charts, rag charts, yeah.\n\n64\n00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.851\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's take a look [INAUDIBLE].\n\n65\n00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:41.581\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Take a look at the purpose of contract\n\n66\n00:03:41.581 --> 00:03:42.242\nmanagement.\n\n67\n00:03:42.242 --> 00:03:43.806\nContract management is,\n\n68\n00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:48.292\nwe're gonna follow the life cycle\nthrough of a contract just for a moment.\n\n69\n00:03:48.292 --> 00:03:50.851\nSo right at the very, very start.\n\n70\n00:03:50.851 --> 00:03:54.418\nThen our service integrator,\nor maybe our customer,\n\n71\n00:03:54.418 --> 00:03:57.674\ndepending on the actual\ncontracts themselves and\n\n72\n00:03:57.674 --> 00:04:01.488\nwhether the service integrator\nis internal or external.\n\n73\n00:04:01.488 --> 00:04:05.736\nThey're going to be evaluating\nthe proposals from service providers.\n\n74\n00:04:05.736 --> 00:04:08.673\nWe're going to be\nnegotiating those contracts.\n\n75\n00:04:08.673 --> 00:04:12.738\nWe're going to be negotiating the service\nlevel targets within the contracts.\n\n76\n00:04:12.738 --> 00:04:17.514\nAnd then, on an ongoing basis,\nonce that contract has been agreed, then\n\n77\n00:04:17.514 --> 00:04:22.538\nwe're going to be evaluating performance\nagainst those contracts as well.\n\n78\n00:04:22.538 --> 00:04:27.278\nSo let's start this off from the very,\nvery beginning, then if you want.\n\n79\n00:04:27.278 --> 00:04:30.088\nSo right at the very, very start,\nwe have an agreement.\n\n80\n00:04:30.088 --> 00:04:33.496\nWhere does that agreement come from?\n\n81\n00:04:33.496 --> 00:04:35.188\n&gt;&gt; You're killing me Jo,\nyou get me every time.\n\n82\n00:04:35.188 --> 00:04:36.878\n&gt;&gt; We've got a requirement, sorry.\n\n83\n00:04:36.878 --> 00:04:37.752\n&gt;&gt; Customer.\n\n84\n00:04:37.752 --> 00:04:39.873\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nthe requirement comes from the customer.\n\n85\n00:04:39.873 --> 00:04:43.969\nAnd the requirement comes into the service\nintegrator probably as a set of\n\n86\n00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:45.694\nservice level requirements.\n\n87\n00:04:45.694 --> 00:04:49.733\nIn other words, these are the service\nlevel targets that I want.\n\n88\n00:04:49.733 --> 00:04:53.458\nI'm gonna use an incident management\nas an example because this is a really,\n\n89\n00:04:53.458 --> 00:04:54.332\nreally easy one.\n\n90\n00:04:54.332 --> 00:04:57.091\nSo for this particular service,\n\n91\n00:04:57.091 --> 00:05:02.419\nmy availability target is\nbetween 08:00 and 20:00.\n\n92\n00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.878\nNow it's 8:00 in the morning and\n8:00 in the afternoon, so 12 hours.\n\n93\n00:05:07.878 --> 00:05:12.402\nAnd I use 24 hours because we're in IT and\nit's easier to use 24 hours.\n\n94\n00:05:12.402 --> 00:05:15.506\nWe like to work in 24 hours in IT,\notherwise we get a bit confused.\n\n95\n00:05:15.506 --> 00:05:18.897\nWell, I do, anyway,\nI don't know about you.\n\n96\n00:05:18.897 --> 00:05:24.024\n&gt;&gt; Even as an American,\nI'm really bad about messing up AM and PM.\n\n97\n00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:24.583\nI get it.\n\n98\n00:05:24.583 --> 00:05:26.014\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just write them wrong.\n\n99\n00:05:26.014 --> 00:05:28.108\nWhich is actually bad.\n\n100\n00:05:28.108 --> 00:05:31.631\nYou'd say it happened at 8 AM when\nit in fact had happened at 8 PM.\n\n101\n00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:33.312\nAnd then people are totally off base.\n\n102\n00:05:33.312 --> 00:05:36.341\nSo I'm a big proponent of going to\n24 hour time for things like this.\n\n103\n00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:39.228\n&gt;&gt; Well, I was brought up in IT and\nalso in Europe as well.\n\n104\n00:05:39.228 --> 00:05:40.700\nSo we just use 24 hours.\n\n105\n00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.950\nAnd it's quite funny because I've\noften seen things written as 08:00 PM.\n\n106\n00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.820\nAnd I just think, no, wait,\nhundred isn't PM I'm don't get that.\n\n107\n00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:56.990\n[LAUGH] So we've got a service\navailability target of 08:00 to 20:00.\n\n108\n00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.597\nAnd so that's our availability, but we've\nalso got an incident management target.\n\n109\n00:06:02.597 --> 00:06:09.360\nIf we get a priority one incident, we\nhave to respond to it within four hours.\n\n110\n00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.489\nThat is my service level target,\nwell there was two there,\n\n111\n00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:20.770\nbetween the customer and\nthe service integrator.\n\n112\n00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.761\nSo the customer has to have email\navailable for those 12 hours.\n\n113\n00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:29.237\nAnd if there is an incident\nwithin those 12 hours,\n\n114\n00:06:29.237 --> 00:06:32.165\nwe've got to respond to it within 4 hours.\n\n115\n00:06:32.165 --> 00:06:34.850\nThat sounds great.\n\n116\n00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:41.029\nSo when there is an incident, the customer\nthen calls up the service desk,\n\n117\n00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:45.951\nand the clock starts ticking,\ntick, tick, tick, tick.\n\n118\n00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:51.060\nThat was my impression of a clock\nby the way, it starts ticking.\n\n119\n00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.175\nIf we've got five different\nservice providers, and\n\n120\n00:06:55.175 --> 00:06:58.565\nthe first one is managing\nthe service desk.\n\n121\n00:06:58.565 --> 00:07:00.617\nSo they take a look at the incident.\n\n122\n00:07:00.617 --> 00:07:04.290\nAnd they take a look at that incident,\nand they say, well,\n\n123\n00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:09.725\nlet's say we've got a contract that's been\nagreed between the service integrator and\n\n124\n00:07:09.725 --> 00:07:11.652\nthat first service provider.\n\n125\n00:07:11.652 --> 00:07:17.134\nWell, the target that we\nshould agree should underpin\n\n126\n00:07:17.134 --> 00:07:22.269\nthat four hours that we've\ngot at this layer here.\n\n127\n00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:26.116\nSo if we've got four hours between\nthe integrator and the customer,\n\n128\n00:07:26.116 --> 00:07:30.493\nthen between the integrator and that\nservice provider, it should be less than\n\n129\n00:07:30.493 --> 00:07:34.430\nfour hours, because we've got to\nunderpin that particular target.\n\n130\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.512\nIt sounds great so far, nice and simple.\n\n131\n00:07:38.512 --> 00:07:41.205\nAnd then we've got to realize that,\nactually,\n\n132\n00:07:41.205 --> 00:07:45.873\nwhat we've got underneath the surface\nintegrator is probably about 15 different\n\n133\n00:07:45.873 --> 00:07:49.371\nservice providers, or maybe just 5,\nlet's keep it simple.\n\n134\n00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:52.987\nSo everything that happens\nunderneath that layer has got\n\n135\n00:07:52.987 --> 00:07:55.103\nto happen within those 4 hours.\n\n136\n00:07:55.103 --> 00:07:58.092\nSo if it gets passed to\nthis service provider, and\n\n137\n00:07:58.092 --> 00:08:02.931\nthen to this service provider, and then to\nthis one and then to this one All of that\n\n138\n00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:07.650\nhas got to get back here and then get back\nto the customer within the four hours.\n\n139\n00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:13.501\nThis is part of the contract negotiation,\nthis is what we've got to negotiate.\n\n140\n00:08:13.501 --> 00:08:20.432\nWhen we first agree our contracts,\nwe've got to negotiate these targets.\n\n141\n00:08:20.432 --> 00:08:26.051\nSo we've gotta make sure\nthat each single service\n\n142\n00:08:26.051 --> 00:08:31.142\nprovider can meet\nthe needs of the business.\n\n143\n00:08:31.142 --> 00:08:35.889\nThat they can deliver that service, or\nresolve that incident in this case,\n\n144\n00:08:35.889 --> 00:08:38.718\nwithin the time that we've been allocated.\n\n145\n00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:40.926\nSo this is your first challenge, and\n\n146\n00:08:40.926 --> 00:08:44.714\nthis is where we have to ensure\nthat we have got collaboration.\n\n147\n00:08:44.714 --> 00:08:49.688\nBecause is that service level target\nbetween here and the customer is 4 hours.\n\n148\n00:08:49.688 --> 00:08:54.306\nThen if I give it to service\nprovider A and they have it for\n\n149\n00:08:54.306 --> 00:08:59.925\n3 hours then, well and may have all\nready taken half an hour to log.\n\n150\n00:08:59.925 --> 00:09:01.952\nSo therefore we log in 30 minutes left and\n\n151\n00:09:01.952 --> 00:09:04.836\nit might have to go through\nanother five service providers.\n\n152\n00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:08.296\nSo that first service provider\ncan't hold to it for too long.\n\n153\n00:09:08.296 --> 00:09:14.006\nSo we have to put close in place within\neach of their contraction to say well,\n\n154\n00:09:14.006 --> 00:09:20.075\nlook when we pass you an incident you only\nhave it for 30 minutes unless you gonna\n\n155\n00:09:20.075 --> 00:09:26.616\ntake the ownership of the resolution that\nsounds okay, except it's not really is it?\n\n156\n00:09:26.616 --> 00:09:30.689\nBecause you could say, okay I'll take\nownership of that resolution and you could\n\n157\n00:09:30.689 --> 00:09:34.835\nbe three hours in before you realize that\nactually if you know what, this is not us.\n\n158\n00:09:34.835 --> 00:09:38.454\nOr I need a bit of cooperation\nfrom another service provider.\n\n159\n00:09:38.454 --> 00:09:43.584\nThis is not an easy seeing to work out.\n\n160\n00:09:43.584 --> 00:09:48.166\nWhen you're dealing with multiple service\nproviders, you have to be able to trust\n\n161\n00:09:48.166 --> 00:09:51.707\nthose service providers and\nyou have to ensure collaboration.\n\n162\n00:09:51.707 --> 00:09:55.696\nWell, that's difficult in itself is\nbecause we're talking about contracts and\n\n163\n00:09:55.696 --> 00:09:58.136\nwe're talking about\nlegally binding contract.\n\n164\n00:09:58.136 --> 00:10:00.334\nSo there has to be an element of trust.\n\n165\n00:10:00.334 --> 00:10:05.991\nBecause if I'm trying to ensure\ncollaboration between my service\n\n166\n00:10:05.991 --> 00:10:11.151\nproviders, am I gonna get that,\nam I really gonna get that?\n\n167\n00:10:11.151 --> 00:10:14.579\nBecause if I write it down in black and\nwhite, there's a tendency then for\n\n168\n00:10:14.579 --> 00:10:15.474\nme to be too rigid.\n\n169\n00:10:15.474 --> 00:10:19.998\nAnd there's also a tendency for those\nparticular service providers to want to\n\n170\n00:10:19.998 --> 00:10:23.027\nstick to the terms and\nconditions of that contract.\n\n171\n00:10:23.027 --> 00:10:27.477\nSo we've gotta make sure that\nwe've got such a good working\n\n172\n00:10:27.477 --> 00:10:32.107\nrelationship with them that we\ncan have that collaboration.\n\n173\n00:10:32.107 --> 00:10:36.334\nThat we nurture our environments in\ncollaboration between those service\n\n174\n00:10:36.334 --> 00:10:40.297\nproviders and by the way we haven't\neven agreed to the contract yet.\n\n175\n00:10:40.297 --> 00:10:43.474\nWe haven't even got it signed,\nwe're still in negotiation.\n\n176\n00:10:43.474 --> 00:10:46.868\nSo the first thing that we have\nto do is understand those service\n\n177\n00:10:46.868 --> 00:10:48.096\nlevel requirements.\n\n178\n00:10:48.096 --> 00:10:51.980\nAnd then we negotiate the appropriate\nservice level targets.\n\n179\n00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.957\nNow, in order to ensure that we\nachieve those service level targets.\n\n180\n00:10:55.957 --> 00:10:58.758\nBecause we're talking about contracts,\n\n181\n00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:03.666\nI would expect us to negotiate penalties\nand incentives in our contracts.\n\n182\n00:11:03.666 --> 00:11:08.369\nWhat would you think would an appropriate\npenalty or an incentive in the contract,\n\n183\n00:11:08.369 --> 00:11:09.521\nwhat have you seen?\n\n184\n00:11:09.521 --> 00:11:15.220\n&gt;&gt; An incentive is, I've seen incentives\nwhere individuals have said well,\n\n185\n00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.829\nyou have four hours.\n\n186\n00:11:16.829 --> 00:11:21.693\nBut if you resolve or\nyou meet this shorter time target then\n\n187\n00:11:21.693 --> 00:11:25.375\nyour incentive is some\nkind of bonus money.\n\n188\n00:11:25.375 --> 00:11:30.274\nThese are very small scale, and I'm not\nsure that they necessarily apply to large\n\n189\n00:11:30.274 --> 00:11:32.768\norganizations with service providers.\n\n190\n00:11:32.768 --> 00:11:35.170\nBut that's what I'm think,\npenalties though.\n\n191\n00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.354\n&gt;&gt; Not sure about bonus money.\n\n192\n00:11:37.354 --> 00:11:43.072\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, bonus money, they're like, maybe\nI'm telling the truth a little too much.\n\n193\n00:11:43.072 --> 00:11:46.112\n&gt;&gt; How many $10 extra today?\n\n194\n00:11:46.112 --> 00:11:47.771\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you,\n\n195\n00:11:47.771 --> 00:11:49.106\nwhat I've seen is like\nconstruction cruise.\n\n196\n00:11:49.106 --> 00:11:49.647\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n197\n00:11:49.647 --> 00:11:50.517\n&gt;&gt; Obviously not IT, right?\n\n198\n00:11:50.517 --> 00:11:53.130\nWhere you say,\nyou have this six month outlay.\n\n199\n00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:56.226\nIf you complete it in four months\nthen you actually get this amount.\n\n200\n00:11:56.226 --> 00:11:59.638\nIf you go beyond that then\nyou actually get fined or\n\n201\n00:11:59.638 --> 00:12:02.490\ndeducted some money every amount of day.\n\n202\n00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:06.225\nSo it's not like I'm sliding a $10\nbill under the table to you or\n\n203\n00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:07.435\nanything like that.\n\n204\n00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:12.319\n&gt;&gt; But then that's a penalty, if you\ndon't meet these service level targets\n\n205\n00:12:12.319 --> 00:12:16.582\nthen we're not paying you 100%\nof your premium this month for\n\n206\n00:12:16.582 --> 00:12:20.768\ninstance, so that is a penalty I\nhave seen service providers and\n\n207\n00:12:20.768 --> 00:12:25.187\nin fact this is something that will\nquite often happen when your home\n\n208\n00:12:25.187 --> 00:12:30.341\nenvironment where a service provider\ndoesn't live up to their expectation.\n\n209\n00:12:30.341 --> 00:12:33.565\nAnd despite the fact that they\ndon't have any penalties and\n\n210\n00:12:33.565 --> 00:12:37.643\nincentives in the contract, they still\nmay offer you a deduction anyway.\n\n211\n00:12:37.643 --> 00:12:41.604\nThey might offer you sort of, well,\nhey we'll give you free month's service or\n\n212\n00:12:41.604 --> 00:12:42.691\nsomething like that.\n\n213\n00:12:42.691 --> 00:12:46.988\nSo I do expect though in contract\nas part of the negotiation,\n\n214\n00:12:46.988 --> 00:12:51.643\nwhen you are relying on service\nproviders talking to each other.\n\n215\n00:12:51.643 --> 00:12:53.969\nI expect to see some sort\nof penalties in there.\n\n216\n00:12:53.969 --> 00:12:59.297\nSo that if collaboration doesn't\nexist then there will be some\n\n217\n00:12:59.297 --> 00:13:05.337\nsort of penalty in there to ensure\nthat collaboration doesn't exist.\n\n218\n00:13:05.337 --> 00:13:10.089\nBut that's only half of the work,\na contract management.\n\n219\n00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:14.434\nBecause the other half of the work is\nmaking sure that service providers,\n\n220\n00:13:14.434 --> 00:13:17.391\nthey are now meeting\nthe terms of their contract.\n\n221\n00:13:17.391 --> 00:13:21.637\nThose service providers are actually\ndoing what they're supposed to do.\n\n222\n00:13:21.637 --> 00:13:25.675\nThis is where we talk about\nthe slam charts and the rag charts.\n\n223\n00:13:25.675 --> 00:13:32.728\nThe slam charts are our SLA Metrics,\nyou could call them contract metrics.\n\n224\n00:13:32.728 --> 00:13:34.972\nThese are the measurements of our KPIs,\n\n225\n00:13:34.972 --> 00:13:37.616\na performance against\na service level target.\n\n226\n00:13:37.616 --> 00:13:41.069\nSo we call them RAG because they are red\nyellow or green like traffic rights.\n\n227\n00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:46.088\nSo a slam chat is just\na total representation\n\n228\n00:13:46.088 --> 00:13:50.708\nof performance against those targets.\n\n229\n00:13:50.708 --> 00:13:52.749\nWhat color do I want to\nsee in a slam chart?\n\n230\n00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:54.538\n&gt;&gt; You've asked me this one before.\n\n231\n00:13:54.538 --> 00:13:56.028\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I said, Green, and\n\n232\n00:13:56.028 --> 00:13:56.883\nyou were said, no.\n\n233\n00:13:56.883 --> 00:13:59.859\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I would say, either amber, or\n\n234\n00:13:59.859 --> 00:14:00.687\na red, right?\n\n235\n00:14:00.687 --> 00:14:03.185\nIf it's not green,\nthat's what I'm guessing.\n\n236\n00:14:03.185 --> 00:14:06.315\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, you have to bear in mind\nthat what we're trying to do is deliver\n\n237\n00:14:06.315 --> 00:14:07.288\nvalue to the customer.\n\n238\n00:14:07.288 --> 00:14:10.823\nAnd by delivering value to the customer\nthen I need to ensure that\n\n239\n00:14:10.823 --> 00:14:13.450\nI'm always align to\nthe needs of the customer.\n\n240\n00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:19.060\nValue is perceived, and so I have seen\nslam charts that are all green before and\n\n241\n00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.279\nI'll go and ask the customer.\n\n242\n00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:24.956\nAnd I'll say, how happy are you with this\nparticular service providers performance\n\n243\n00:14:24.956 --> 00:14:26.296\nand they'll say, not at all.\n\n244\n00:14:26.296 --> 00:14:30.681\nAnd the service provider will say well,\nhang on that I'm on my target, yes, but\n\n245\n00:14:30.681 --> 00:14:32.566\nwhat about the outage last night?\n\n246\n00:14:32.566 --> 00:14:37.505\nSo if your slam charts are not a true\nreflection of value perception\n\n247\n00:14:37.505 --> 00:14:42.457\nthen you're measuring the wrong thing,\nit's as simple as that.\n\n248\n00:14:42.457 --> 00:14:45.215\nI'm looking for\nit as well where I can improve.\n\n249\n00:14:45.215 --> 00:14:51.347\nAnd trust me, there will always,\nalways be areas where you can improve.\n\n250\n00:14:51.347 --> 00:14:56.117\nIf your slam chart is all green\nthat tells me that your service\n\n251\n00:14:56.117 --> 00:15:01.551\nprovider is probably doing their\nbest to make the reports look good.\n\n252\n00:15:01.551 --> 00:15:04.866\nBut if you're not 100% happy\nwith your service provider,\n\n253\n00:15:04.866 --> 00:15:06.742\ngiven that you are their customer,\n\n254\n00:15:06.742 --> 00:15:10.888\nthen the slam charts are measuring\nthe wrong things, it's as simple as that.\n\n255\n00:15:10.888 --> 00:15:14.929\n&gt;&gt; This seems like,\nwe'll that doesn't seem right.\n\n256\n00:15:14.929 --> 00:15:18.876\nHowever, if you've ever been in\na case where someone has asked you to\n\n257\n00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:21.953\nmaybe rate a class or\nrate your teaching experience.\n\n258\n00:15:21.953 --> 00:15:24.327\nOr rate the personal interaction,\nor the phone interaction.\n\n259\n00:15:24.327 --> 00:15:29.115\nHere's a key point that I learned, if you\nsee someone give ten's all the way down\n\n260\n00:15:29.115 --> 00:15:32.286\nthen either that person's\nnot taking it serious, or\n\n261\n00:15:32.286 --> 00:15:35.049\nyou're asking the wrong questions, right.\n\n262\n00:15:35.049 --> 00:15:35.646\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n263\n00:15:35.646 --> 00:15:40.099\n&gt;&gt; There's no way for you to get better\nunless you highlight the shortcomings that\n\n264\n00:15:40.099 --> 00:15:43.355\nyou are having Which means you\nhave to ask hard questions or\n\n265\n00:15:43.355 --> 00:15:47.675\nreally evaluate what you're trying to\nmeasure in order to get a good metric of\n\n266\n00:15:47.675 --> 00:15:50.291\nlike, well I'm not delivering on this.\n\n267\n00:15:50.291 --> 00:15:52.472\nAnd that's what we mean by not green.\n\n268\n00:15:52.472 --> 00:15:56.751\nIt caught me off guard initially also,\nbut that makes sense.\n\n269\n00:15:56.751 --> 00:16:00.425\nIf you're not seeing amber and red.\n\n270\n00:16:00.425 --> 00:16:03.676\nThen more or less,\nyou're just doing it for the ceremony.\n\n271\n00:16:03.676 --> 00:16:04.548\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n272\n00:16:04.548 --> 00:16:08.440\nIf I say and old green slam chart,\nI'm less likely to believe it.\n\n273\n00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.250\nAnd the things is, that as customer if\nI they see an old green slam chart,\n\n274\n00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.030\nthey're less slightly\nto believe it either.\n\n275\n00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.940\nThey less lightly\nthe incredibility in this.\n\n276\n00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.680\nThey sense the sevice providers\nin not being honest with\n\n277\n00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.850\nthis because we're just aiming for green.\n\n278\n00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:26.910\nAnd so, I want to see areas,\nopportunities for improvement.\n\n279\n00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.097\nSo contract management is not easy.\n\n280\n00:16:31.097 --> 00:16:35.680\nBecause we've got to manage those\nrelationships between all of those service\n\n281\n00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.760\nproviders.\n\n282\n00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:41.660\nAnd we've got to ensure that we\nhave contracts that are water\n\n283\n00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:46.350\ntight enough to be able to get us what we\nneed and deliver value to the customer.\n\n284\n00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:51.610\nBut not too rigid that they\nare [INAUDIBLE] providers.\n\n285\n00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:55.670\nOur service providers, not suppliers,\nwant to cling to them rigidly and\n\n286\n00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.380\nthen they actually don't\nencourage collaboration.\n\n287\n00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.850\nThat they discourage collaboration.\n\n288\n00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:07.350\nAnd that brings us into CSI and\nbecause whenever we have\n\n289\n00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:10.690\nany slam charts that are showing red or\nthey are showing amber.\n\n290\n00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:14.730\nThen to us, I have already mentioned,\nthat's an opportunity for improvement.\n\n291\n00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:19.950\nAnd that's exactly what CSI is,\nCSI, continual service improvement.\n\n292\n00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:24.571\nIt's ensuring that we\nare continually checking that we\n\n293\n00:17:24.571 --> 00:17:29.200\nare relying to the needs of\nthe customer organization.\n\n294\n00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.559\nCSI likes to measure, and\nthis is why I mention slam charts, and\n\n295\n00:17:33.559 --> 00:17:38.130\nthen we kind of segued into CSI\nbecause CSI likes to measure.\n\n296\n00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:42.768\nWe want to ensure that we are continually\naligned to the needs of the organization.\n\n297\n00:17:42.768 --> 00:17:48.200\nThat means that CSI will be\ninterrogating every single process\n\n298\n00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.080\nto make sure that it's doing\nwhat it's supposed to do.\n\n299\n00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.710\nAnd what I mean every single process,\nI even mean business\n\n300\n00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:58.940\nrelationship management, to ensure that\nthey are continually asking the right\n\n301\n00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:03.600\nquestions of the customer, to ensure that\nwe are delivering what the customer needs.\n\n302\n00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.120\nWe are measuring and we are valuing and\n\n303\n00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:11.470\nassessing every single report that\ncomes from every single process.\n\n304\n00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:15.590\nWe are assessing every single report\nthat comes from every single service and\n\n305\n00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:19.620\nwe are looking for areas to improve.\n\n306\n00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:26.470\nNothing is exempt from CSI,\nabsolutely nothing.\n\n307\n00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:29.360\nAnd that means that no service provider\n\n308\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:34.620\nin an ecosystem is exempt from\ncontinuous service improvement either.\n\n309\n00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:41.010\nEverything can be improved and so\nwe have a process within the ecosystem\n\n310\n00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:46.670\nthat will evaluate the performance\nof every single service provider,\n\n311\n00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:51.290\nthe performance of every single process,\nthe performance of every single service.\n\n312\n00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:55.860\nAnd on a regular basis,\nmake recommendations for improvement.\n\n313\n00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.950\nNow, if contract management\nare already making recommendations for\n\n314\n00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:04.210\nimprovement based on performance against\nservice level targets, then that's great.\n\n315\n00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.360\nBecause they're doing that as part of CSI.\n\n316\n00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:12.140\nRemember what I said in a previous episode\nin that we're not talking about people,\n\n317\n00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.990\nwe're talking about processes.\n\n318\n00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:15.870\nAnd CSI is a process.\n\n319\n00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.550\nBut it's one that\neverybody must undertake.\n\n320\n00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:21.010\nWe want to improve absolutely everything.\n\n321\n00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:28.443\nAnd so CSI is embedded into every\nsingle process that we have.\n\n322\n00:19:28.443 --> 00:19:30.926\nWe will have a formal process for CSI.\n\n323\n00:19:30.926 --> 00:19:31.804\nI want to see CSI mentioned\nin every single contract.\n\n324\n00:19:31.804 --> 00:19:34.125\nI want to see improvements,\n\n325\n00:19:34.125 --> 00:19:39.639\nI want to see it mentioned in every\nsingle process documentation and\n\n326\n00:19:39.639 --> 00:19:46.150\nwhen we talk about maturity of our\nprocesses and evaluate in the maturity.\n\n327\n00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.830\nIf I don't have CSI built\ninto the process, so\n\n328\n00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.040\nif I don't have some way\nof collecting feedback and\n\n329\n00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.730\nthen acting on that feedback,\nthen we don't have a mutual process.\n\n330\n00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.520\nCSI has to be part of\neverything that we do.\n\n331\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.960\nAnd it might seem like, well okay,\n\n332\n00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.420\nthen that was a very cursory mention\nof CSI and then that's pretty much it.\n\n333\n00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.640\nAnd it's not.\n\n334\n00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.630\nIt's because CSI is everything that we do.\n\n335\n00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:17.880\nEverything that we do is to improve and\nso, when we talk about CSI,\n\n336\n00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.770\nwe talk about it as part\nof everything else.\n\n337\n00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.540\nAnd everything that we've spoken about so\nfar, in previous episodes and\n\n338\n00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.820\nin this, is to improve.\n\n339\n00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.240\nWe don't do anything to have\na detrimental effect on I.T.\n\n340\n00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.810\n&gt;&gt; I'm starting to see a pattern here Jo,\n\n341\n00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:35.090\nthat some of these processes\nare more about metaprocesses or\n\n342\n00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:38.810\nthe processes themselves are embedded\nin some of the other processes,\n\n343\n00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:43.258\nas a means of making sure that they\neither work or they're improving.\n\n344\n00:20:43.258 --> 00:20:48.260\nAnd I'm guessing, CSI process is\nalso going to evaluate itself about\n\n345\n00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.740\nhow effectively it's\nevaluating other processes.\n\n346\n00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.230\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes.\n\n347\n00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.980\n&gt;&gt; Man, that's a mind bender for you.\n\n348\n00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.020\nBut that makes sense, right?\n\n349\n00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.320\nI need to know how well I'm\nevaluating other processes\n\n350\n00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.380\nto determine if my evaluation\nof other processes.\n\n351\n00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.340\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Are accurate and\n\n352\n00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.780\ngiving me appropriate glimpses\ninto how I can improve.\n\n353\n00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:09.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n354\n00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:16.240\n&gt;&gt; The one question I have is and\nI'm all for continual improvement.\n\n355\n00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.990\nAre there any points that we should\nbe wary about diminishing in\n\n356\n00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:22.550\nreturns where we're trying to squeeze\nthat last little bit of improvement, but\n\n357\n00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.670\nmaybe it's just good enough?\n\n358\n00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.449\nOr should we always strive to move\nforward on some kind of a program?\n\n359\n00:21:28.449 --> 00:21:32.228\n&gt;&gt; We should always strive to\nmove forward, so with CSI,\n\n360\n00:21:32.228 --> 00:21:37.813\nif we are at that point where we say,\nwell, look we can't be improving any more,\n\n361\n00:21:37.813 --> 00:21:41.204\nwe can't, everything is running at 100%.\n\n362\n00:21:41.204 --> 00:21:44.669\nWell, in that case, you're gonna have\nto evaluate the service itself and\n\n363\n00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:48.088\nask whether that service is still\nmeeting the needs of the organization.\n\n364\n00:21:48.088 --> 00:21:50.654\nRather than just look at your\ndelivery of the service and\n\n365\n00:21:50.654 --> 00:21:53.230\nhow we can improve\nthe delivery of the service.\n\n366\n00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.360\nIs the service itself still meeting\nthe needs of the organization?\n\n367\n00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.966\nHuman nature, whenever I bring human\nnature into something Justin groans.\n\n368\n00:22:01.966 --> 00:22:06.210\nCuz he thins, yeah, okay then,\nit's that unknown entity as it were,\n\n369\n00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:09.560\nbut human nature itself says, that\nwe're always very quick to change now.\n\n370\n00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.260\nWe're expecting change.\n\n371\n00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.900\nAnd it's jut just about we're expecting\nour services to become more reliable,\n\n372\n00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.250\nnow we're expecting our services\nto add in more features as well.\n\n373\n00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:24.560\nSo, we never gonna get to the point\nwhere we are 100% aligned with the needs\n\n374\n00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.950\nof the business, because the needs of\nthe business are gonna start off here and\n\n375\n00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.760\nas we catch up,\nthe needs of the business move out.\n\n376\n00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.820\nAnd then we just carry on, catching up.\n\n377\n00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.020\nSo we never actually going\nto be completely aligned\n\n378\n00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.189\nto the needs of the business.\n\n379\n00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:44.290\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense, I guess I just\nwanted to make sure that you're not\n\n380\n00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:49.650\ntrying to push for, and I think you\nhit essentially what I'm asking about.\n\n381\n00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:53.440\nIs that, if it is a 100%,\nyou're like it's perfect,\n\n382\n00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.185\nthen maybe you need to reevaluate-\n&gt;&gt; We need to do something else.-\n\n383\n00:22:56.185 --> 00:22:57.200\n&gt;&gt; Whether\n\n384\n00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.040\nthat service is actually what you need.\n\n385\n00:22:59.040 --> 00:22:59.540\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n386\n00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.958\nMaybe you need something else that maybe\n\n387\n00:23:01.958 --> 00:23:04.802\nis not a 100% but\nis gonna provide more value\n\n388\n00:23:04.802 --> 00:23:07.825\nas your business needs continue to change.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n389\n00:23:07.825 --> 00:23:09.074\ndefinitely.\n&gt;&gt; So Jo,\n\n390\n00:23:09.074 --> 00:23:13.982\nwe've talked about contract management and\ncontinual improvement.\n\n391\n00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.550\nSeems like we're at a stopping point.\n\n392\n00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:17.870\nBut where are we going from here?\n\n393\n00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:21.120\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, in our next episode\nwe're gonna take a look at the processes\n\n394\n00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.680\nof event management, and then we're going\nto look at financial management as well.\n\n395\n00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.865\nAnd I can't wait for that one.\n\n396\n00:23:27.865 --> 00:23:29.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That one\ndoes sound like a dozy.\n\n397\n00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.520\nSo, you should definitely join us back.\n\n398\n00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.500\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget of here.\n\n399\n00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.570\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've being your host Justin Dennison.\n\n400\n00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:37.370\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n401\n00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:39.672\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n402\n00:23:39.672 --> 00:23:45.758\n[MUSIC]\n\n403\n00:23:45.758 -->

You're watching ITPRO.TV\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.090\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.720\nI'm your host, Justin Denisson, and we're\ncontinuing on with SIAM Foundation and\n\n6\n00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.499\nwe're gonna be looking\nat Financial Management.\n\n7\n00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:27.530\nAnd event management in this episode\nis part of our SIAM processes.\n\n8\n00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.760\nAs Jo have said this isn't so\nmuch a mini-series as it is a sub-series.\n\n9\n00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.755\nSo, and I just said I kinda\ngave away the bag, right?\n\n10\n00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:36.899\nMs. Jo Peacock is here\nto help us out today.\n\n11\n00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:37.990\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n\n12\n00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.880\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great.\n\n13\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.630\nThank you, Justin how are you?\n\n14\n00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.711\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic and when I hear\nfinancial management, I think, ooh money,\n\n15\n00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.723\nand when I think event management,\nooh, party planning.\n\n16\n00:00:47.723 --> 00:00:50.454\nAnd those are the two things\nthat come to mind, but\n\n17\n00:00:50.454 --> 00:00:53.590\nI suspect that I am way off\nbase at least in one of those.\n\n18\n00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.780\n&gt;&gt; At least in one of those.\n\n19\n00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.970\nYeah, we are not talking about\nthe event where we have alcohol and\n\n20\n00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.930\nlots of family and friends around.\n\n21\n00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.391\nAlthough if it's anything like my family,\n\n22\n00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:03.650\nthen you need the alcohol if you've\ngot family and friends around.\n\n23\n00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.010\nBut no, we're not talking about that.\n\n24\n00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.870\nWe're talking about events.\n\n25\n00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.115\nWe're talking about things that happen.\n\n26\n00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:14.690\nAn event is just change of\nstate that has significance for\n\n27\n00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.610\nthe management of the infrastructure.\n\n28\n00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.460\nIt's something that happens.\n\n29\n00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.330\nAn event management is about\nmonitoring those events and\n\n30\n00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.180\nthen doing something about it.\n\n31\n00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.520\nSo if we just take a look at\nthe purpose of event management,\n\n32\n00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.030\nlook at that, before I even said it,\nit was there on the screen.\n\n33\n00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.590\nPurpose of Event Management\nis to monitor components,\n\n34\n00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.620\nsystems, services, and then do\nsomething about what we're monitoring.\n\n35\n00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.330\nMakes sense?\n\n36\n00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.610\n&gt;&gt; That does make sense.\n\n37\n00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.626\nI'm guessing this is both for\npositive and negative possible events\n\n38\n00:01:51.626 --> 00:01:56.210\nlike would bad things happening\nbe considered events as well as\n\n39\n00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.066\nI don't know a good thing,\nmaybe I'm kind of negatively minded.\n\n40\n00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:02.990\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let, well yeah, don't be.\n\n41\n00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.450\nLet's be positive, yeah?\n\n42\n00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.850\nLet's think about what we've got at home.\n\n43\n00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.750\nThink about your thermostat\nthat's in the house, right?\n\n44\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.360\nYou've got a thermostat..\n\n45\n00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.434\nI'm hoping you've got a thermostat,\neither that or\n\n46\n00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:19.232\nwe're here in Florida it's gonna get very,\nvery warm very quickly in your house.\n\n47\n00:02:19.232 --> 00:02:20.548\nSo a thermostat performs event management.\n\n48\n00:02:20.548 --> 00:02:24.812\nAn event management is the process\nof monitoring something,\n\n49\n00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:30.060\ncomparing against the norm and then\ndepending on what the changes state is,\n\n50\n00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.750\nthen taking appropriate control action.\n\n51\n00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.900\nLet's give you an example,\nan example away from IT.\n\n52\n00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.260\nSo, an event is to something that's\nhappened, it's a change of state.\n\n53\n00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.450\nSo your thermostat sits in the wall\nat home, and it monitors your\n\n54\n00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.460\ncurrent temperature, and your temperature\nit's gonna compare it against the norm.\n\n55\n00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.160\nNow, when I say the norm, I mean\nthe temperature that you set your room at.\n\n56\n00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.500\nNow, this is gonna be quite a difficult\none because I know it for a fact\n\n57\n00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.600\nthat you've probably set your room at\na completely different temperature to me.\n\n58\n00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.580\nCuz I'm gonna set my room at 20 degrees.\n\n59\n00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.541\nI don't know what you're doing.\n\n60\n00:03:03.541 --> 00:03:06.405\n&gt;&gt; 20, I don't know, I would probably are,\nwe're talking Celsius here, right?\n\n61\n00:03:06.405 --> 00:03:07.352\n&gt;&gt; Right, [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n62\n00:03:07.352 --> 00:03:08.359\n&gt;&gt; Let's further clarify.\n\n63\n00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.934\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Units are important in temperature.\n\n64\n00:03:10.934 --> 00:03:14.240\nBut I was like okay,\nyeah probably, 20 is fine.\n\n65\n00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.778\n&gt;&gt; Yeah about 20, so\nwe'll stick with Celcius, okay,\n\n66\n00:03:16.778 --> 00:03:18.570\nso I'm gonna set mine to 20 degrees.\n\n67\n00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.832\nAnd that thermostat is going monitor\nthe temperature in the room.\n\n68\n00:03:22.832 --> 00:03:28.196\nAnd if the temperature drops below 20,\nthen it does something\n\n69\n00:03:28.196 --> 00:03:33.622\nit takes an appropriate action and\nit turns on the heat.\n\n70\n00:03:33.622 --> 00:03:39.250\nAnd say, so what happens then is\nthe heat warms up the room and then once\n\n71\n00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.390\nthat temperature reaches 20 degrees again\nin the room, then it turns off the heat.\n\n72\n00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.180\nIn other words it takes\nan appropriate controlled action.\n\n73\n00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.740\nSo all the time the thermostat is\nmonitoring the temperature in the room,\n\n74\n00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.450\nand it's comparing it against\nwhat we've set on the thermostat,\n\n75\n00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.080\nwhich is 20 degrees.\n\n76\n00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.700\nAnd so, that's called event management,\nand event management is about\n\n77\n00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.260\nmonitoring something and\nthen doing something about it.\n\n78\n00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.620\nSo event management,\nwe may monitor the jobs that are running.\n\n79\n00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.141\nAnd if one of them fails,\nthen it will do something about it.\n\n80\n00:04:09.141 --> 00:04:13.245\nIt may pick up the job,\nit may restart for the job for instance,\n\n81\n00:04:13.245 --> 00:04:17.364\nit may just terminate the job and\nmove on to the next [INAUDIBLE].\n\n82\n00:04:17.364 --> 00:04:21.380\nThe key is that event management\ndoes something about it.\n\n83\n00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.530\nEven management is the only\nprocess that is probably\n\n84\n00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.200\ngoing to be fully automated by the way.\n\n85\n00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.730\nProbably.\n\n86\n00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.620\nRemember were talking about efficiency and\neffectiveness, and\n\n87\n00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.660\nit's not particularly efficient for\nevent management not to be automated.\n\n88\n00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.710\nSo it's probably going\nto be fully automated.\n\n89\n00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.269\nNow, that brings us into,\nit sounds fairly easy up until now yeah,\n\n90\n00:04:44.269 --> 00:04:45.927\nsounds fairly straightforward.\n\n91\n00:04:45.927 --> 00:04:47.144\nAre you okay with event management?\n\n92\n00:04:47.144 --> 00:04:49.290\n&gt;&gt; I feel like this is a trap.\n\n93\n00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.430\nIt sounds pretty easy, but I suspect here,\nyou're getting to add a little bit of\n\n94\n00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.460\ncomplexity that maybe the surface\nis not immediately considered but\n\n95\n00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.390\nit's important to consider as\nwe think about event management.\n\n96\n00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:07.292\nWell it depends, if we are in that\nparticular, in the traditional framework.\n\n97\n00:05:07.292 --> 00:05:11.670\nIf we're in a traditional mode, where we\nhave that internal service provider, and\n\n98\n00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.290\nthe internal service provider is\nworking with your organization and\n\n99\n00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.360\nthen monitoring events, etc.,\nand perform an event management.\n\n100\n00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.910\nThat seems to be fairly straightforward.\n\n101\n00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.084\nHowever, what we've got,\n\n102\n00:05:24.084 --> 00:05:27.710\nis we've got an environment where\nwe've got the service integrator, but\n\n103\n00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.390\nthen underpinning that service integrator,\nwe have got multiple service providers.\n\n104\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.880\nAnd each one of those may be\nperforming some degree of automation.\n\n105\n00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.050\nThe other problem is that each one of\nthose may be performing some degree of\n\n106\n00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.100\nmonitoring of event management automation\nthat may then have a direct impact\n\n107\n00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.550\non the event management of\nanother service provider.\n\n108\n00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.950\nI wanna take that example.\n\n109\n00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.870\nAnd I just wanna expand it a little bit.\n\n110\n00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.650\nSo let's say, for instance, and\n\n111\n00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.520\nwe'd call this a complex monitor\ncontrol loop, by the way.\n\n112\n00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.640\nBut let's say that, what we have to do,\nis we've got a thermostat\n\n113\n00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.310\nthat monitors the entire temperature\nof this entire building.\n\n114\n00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.054\nOkay, and we want to keep that at 20.\n\n115\n00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.870\nBut then in each individual\nstudio which is what we have,\n\n116\n00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.590\nwe've got a thermostat that monitors the\nentire temperature of every single studio.\n\n117\n00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.480\nSo, we control the temperature\nof the studio, right?\n\n118\n00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.199\nJust say yes.\n\n119\n00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:37.664\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say yes, but\nsometimes it doesn't-\n\n120\n00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:38.788\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it doesn't feel like that, right.\n\n121\n00:06:38.788 --> 00:06:40.011\n&gt;&gt; It might a little warm in here.\n\n122\n00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:42.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, but we do.\n\n123\n00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.250\nSo we control the temperature\nof this studio, but then,\n\n124\n00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.170\nI don't know,\nI don't know who's next door.\n\n125\n00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.060\nLet's think that Mike might control\nthe temperature of that studio.\n\n126\n00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:59.100\nBut you see in order to be able to control\nthe temperature of the entire building,\n\n127\n00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.300\nwe have to regulate the temperature\nacross each individual room.\n\n128\n00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.760\nSo if we want a service provider,\nand let's say Mike and Ronnie or\n\n129\n00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.350\nanother service provider.\n\n130\n00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.640\nAnd the service integrator,\n\n131\n00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.110\nthe person who is in charge of\nthe entire building, in our case, Nate.\n\n132\n00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.637\nNate needs to ensure that if we got\nour studios too cold, that the rest of\n\n133\n00:07:18.637 --> 00:07:23.617\nthe building has an increase temperature\nin order to accommodate that because\n\n134\n00:07:23.617 --> 00:07:27.627\nwe want to maintain a consistent\ntemperature of 20 degrees.\n\n135\n00:07:27.627 --> 00:07:31.190\n[BLANK AUDIO] Makes sense.\n\n136\n00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.040\nOkay, but\nwe're talking about individuals, and\n\n137\n00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.420\nwe're talking about individual rooms,\nand we're talking about temperature.\n\n138\n00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.100\nAnd that can be quite complex in a large\norganization and in a large building.\n\n139\n00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.470\nBut now let's think about\nother types of jobs.\n\n140\n00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.710\nSo if we've got certain jobs,\nlet's say that we've got a print job and\n\n141\n00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:53.210\nwe were your utility company, and we are\nprinting out invoices every single month.\n\n142\n00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.910\nWe're printing out bills to\nbe sent off to the customer.\n\n143\n00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:00.160\nBut the printing of those\nbills is entirely dependent on\n\n144\n00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.940\nthe processing of the job to\nactually calculate the bills.\n\n145\n00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.750\nBut if the printing of the bills\nis done by one service provider,\n\n146\n00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.840\ncuz sometimes that's outsourced.\n\n147\n00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.610\nAnd the calculating of the jobs is\ndone by another service provider,\n\n148\n00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.050\nthen we have a dependency here.\n\n149\n00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.920\nAnd these guys who are printing out\nthe bills will fail their service level\n\n150\n00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.770\ntargets, will fail in their contracts,\nif they don't print out the bills.\n\n151\n00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:28.326\nBut if the bills aren't available for them\nto be printed out because these guys here\n\n152\n00:08:28.326 --> 00:08:31.780\nhave had some problem with\nevent management here.\n\n153\n00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:36.369\n[SOUND] We've got a knock on effect And\nthen if the bills get sent out and\n\n154\n00:08:36.369 --> 00:08:38.967\nthe customers are expected\nto pay them within, well,\n\n155\n00:08:38.967 --> 00:08:43.185\ntwo hours of receiving the bill, because\nthey didn't get the bills quick enough.\n\n156\n00:08:43.185 --> 00:08:45.785\nYou can see how this can compound itself.\n\n157\n00:08:45.785 --> 00:08:48.505\nSo event management, whilst we say well,\n\n158\n00:08:48.505 --> 00:08:53.575\nit can be fully automated, when we're\ntalking across service providers,\n\n159\n00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:55.975\nthen of course we have that\nadded complexity as well.\n\n160\n00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:00.670\nSo even management might\nseem quite simple but\n\n161\n00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:05.850\non the surface, the principle and\nthe concept is incredibly simple.\n\n162\n00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.950\nHowever, when we're talking about\nindividual service providers then\n\n163\n00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:13.400\nobviously that can, across these service\nproviders, that can be a challenge.\n\n164\n00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.580\n&gt;&gt; And it seems like we have\nto make considerations for\n\n165\n00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.960\nwhole versus individual pieces.\n\n166\n00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.950\nI mean,\nwe've talked about these dependencies.\n\n167\n00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:22.130\nBut if I go back to the temperature,\n\n168\n00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.010\nI was thinking more about that\ntemperature example, right.\n\n169\n00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.970\nOur individual studios,\nlet's say those are at 20.\n\n170\n00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.036\nBut, excuse me, let's say those are at 15.\n\n171\n00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:33.313\nNumber one, that would be,\nthat will be fairly cool looking.\n\n172\n00:09:33.313 --> 00:09:34.384\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Maybe a little bit, yeah.\n\n173\n00:09:34.384 --> 00:09:37.507\n&gt;&gt; But let's say that the building needs\nto maintain an average temperature of\n\n174\n00:09:37.507 --> 00:09:38.960\n20 degrees.\n\n175\n00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.876\nIf the compensation for the remainder\nof the rooms in the building,\n\n176\n00:09:42.876 --> 00:09:47.687\nother than our studios, was to increase\nthat temperature, then that can possibly\n\n177\n00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:52.313\nhave an unforeseen effect in the people\nthat reside in those respective rooms.\n\n178\n00:09:52.313 --> 00:09:56.141\nIs that something we need to consider when\nwe have kind of this tiered structure\n\n179\n00:09:56.141 --> 00:10:00.550\nof let's monitor this, that's monitoring\nthese sub-monitoring stations then making\n\n180\n00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.110\ndecisions based on that?\n\n181\n00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:02.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n182\n00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:08.300\nit also depends on how we're actually\ncontrolling that overall temperature.\n\n183\n00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.620\nBecause, if we're controlling\nthe temperature in each room and\n\n184\n00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:16.990\nwe're looking for say,\nthe median point across every single\n\n185\n00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:21.850\nroom, the median of which so we've\ngot five thermostats at each room and\n\n186\n00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.040\nthen we're just gonna add it all out and\ndivide it by five,\n\n187\n00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.450\nthen that's one way of looking at it.\n\n188\n00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:30.440\nBut then that can cause a problem because\nif one of us has got it up to sort of\n\n189\n00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.610\n13 degrees then everybody else is gonna\nhave to be lower to accommodate for that.\n\n190\n00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:39.320\nOr maybe what we want to do is\nfind that sort of sweet spot and\n\n191\n00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.930\nput some thresholds in the individual\n\n192\n00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:46.720\nthermostats themselves to ensure that\nwe remain at a consistent temperature.\n\n193\n00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.270\nThere's lots of ways of doing that.\n\n194\n00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.590\nYou were thinking something about\nthat word there, I see that.\n\n195\n00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so,\nI can see limiting thresholds, but\n\n196\n00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.550\nI can also see choosing how\nyou're going to measure.\n\n197\n00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:04.390\nWhat I mean is, you said add them all\nup and divide by five, if we had five.\n\n198\n00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:08.370\nCool, that is a measure of\nkinda where everything is.\n\n199\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.820\nBut don't know the spread though.\n\n200\n00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.638\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, we got, wait a minute.\n\n201\n00:11:12.638 --> 00:11:17.164\nWhat if ones' at 30, one's at 10,\nand then the other three are at 20.\n\n202\n00:11:17.164 --> 00:11:20.555\nWill that actually gives you-\n&gt;&gt; You're 20 degrees.\n\n203\n00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:23.040\n&gt;&gt; You're 20 degrees and nothing changes.\n\n204\n00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.021\nA 30 degrees C,\npretty toasty inside of a room.\n\n205\n00:11:27.021 --> 00:11:29.188\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then 10 degrees C,\n\n206\n00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:32.120\nit's getting on the cool side,\nnot gonna lie to you.\n\n207\n00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.040\n&gt;&gt; I think it's been on legal minimum or\nsomething.\n\n208\n00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.660\n&gt;&gt; It's probably your freezer, [LAUGH]\nit's getting close to there, right.\n\n209\n00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.569\nSome kind of refrigerant.\n\n210\n00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.460\nIt may be better to pick\na different metric at that point\n\n211\n00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.065\nthat will give you more insight, right?\n\n212\n00:11:47.065 --> 00:11:51.400\nInstead of the mean, maybe you\nactually do take the mode, right.\n\n213\n00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.840\nWhere you say,\nwhat is the most common one?\n\n214\n00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.570\nIn this case, the example I just gave,\nactually still fails.\n\n215\n00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:57.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n216\n00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.150\n&gt;&gt; Because the mode is still 20.\n\n217\n00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.558\nBut, there's some considerations\nof how you measure and\n\n218\n00:12:02.558 --> 00:12:08.610\nthen do you impose thresholds in order to\nalleviate issues with that measurement?\n\n219\n00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.650\nIf we come back and say mean,\nmedian or mode, whatever.\n\n220\n00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.150\nBut, you can't go above 25 and\nyou can't go below 15,\n\n221\n00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.520\nthen we can still pick one\nof those metrics, right.\n\n222\n00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.930\nBut we can also impose thresholds\nthat make it easier for\n\n223\n00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.120\nus to reason about what's going on.\n\n224\n00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n225\n00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:31.468\nThere's no, and\nI know I say this quite a lot, but\n\n226\n00:12:31.468 --> 00:12:34.837\nwhen it comes to this type of management.\n\n227\n00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:38.349\nThere's no right or wrong because it\nreally depends on what it is you're\n\n228\n00:12:38.349 --> 00:12:42.570\nmanaging and in this instance, there is no\nright or wrong in that particular example.\n\n229\n00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.920\nBecause some people might like the studios\nto be a little bit on the toasty side,\n\n230\n00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.770\nand some people might like the studios\nto be a little bit on the cool side.\n\n231\n00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.580\nPersonally I like it to be a little bit on\nthe cool side because I don't want Justin\n\n232\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.350\nfalling asleep and starting to snore\nin the middle of it all, you know.\n\n233\n00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:58.530\nIt's just simple as that.\n\n234\n00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:02.750\nBut nevertheless, it also depends on and\nI have to say this when we talk about\n\n235\n00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.650\ntemperature, I mean, it could depend\non the number of people in the room.\n\n236\n00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.510\nThe more people that you've got in the\nroom the warmer the room's going to be.\n\n237\n00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.810\nAnd therefore even though\nthe thermostat itself might measure\n\n238\n00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:16.780\nthat it's on 20 degrees nevertheless\nit might not actually be 20 degrees,\n\n239\n00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.990\nit might feel more like 35 in here.\n\n240\n00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.610\nBecause you've got 15 people in here.\n\n241\n00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.740\nSo it depends on a number of factors,\nand that was just an example,\n\n242\n00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.380\nbut this is what event\nmanagement is doing.\n\n243\n00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.040\nEvent management is\nmonitoring those events and\n\n244\n00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.770\nthen deciding what to do about it.\n\n245\n00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:39.350\nAnd of course, then we have to spread that\ncomplexity and manage that complexity\n\n246\n00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:42.240\nacross all of the relationships\nwith all of our service providers.\n\n247\n00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.770\nThat brings us into our second process for\nthis particular episode,\n\n248\n00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.410\nand that process is financial management.\n\n249\n00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.860\nNow, financial management,\nI like to use the word stewardship.\n\n250\n00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.550\nIt's about the efficient and\neffective stewardship of our money.\n\n251\n00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.900\nNo, it's not about you having more\nmoney to spend, Justin, definitely not.\n\n252\n00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.570\n&gt;&gt; But that sounded so amazing,\n\n253\n00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.160\nI was all aboard until you told\nme that's not what it was.\n\n254\n00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.780\n&gt;&gt; No, sorry, no.\n\n255\n00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.950\nThis is about how much money have\nwe got to spend, that's budgeting.\n\n256\n00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:19.940\nHow much have we as a service\nintegrator got to spend.\n\n257\n00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:24.890\nAnd how much money do we have to\nspend with our service providers.\n\n258\n00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:29.020\nOf course, all of that comes in to our\ncontracts, but we still have to budget for\n\n259\n00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.680\nour contracts of our service providers.\n\n260\n00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.170\nAnd then we have to perform accounting.\n\n261\n00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.900\nHow much money have we spent and\nwhere have we spent it?\n\n262\n00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:42.270\nAnd then of course this charging as well,\nand of course there's always going to be\n\n263\n00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:46.060\ncharging goes on in this\nparticular ecosystem.\n\n264\n00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:52.530\nBecause each service provider could\nbe charging another service provider.\n\n265\n00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:58.320\nIt really depends on how\nthe contracts are actually set up.\n\n266\n00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.680\nIf everybody's contract is\nwith the service integrator,\n\n267\n00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.450\nwhich is what would make the most sense.\n\n268\n00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:10.330\nThen obviously, each service provider\nis charging the service integrator and\n\n269\n00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.500\nthe service integrator is\nthen charging the customer.\n\n270\n00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.380\nThat's what would make most sense.\n\n271\n00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:22.755\nBut the customer, believe it or\nnot, owns all the contracts.\n\n272\n00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:26.785\n&gt;&gt; That tends to put\na little bit of wrinkle in,\n\n273\n00:15:26.785 --> 00:15:28.735\nin kind of how this is all managed, right?\n\n274\n00:15:28.735 --> 00:15:29.755\nYou have an ownership but\n\n275\n00:15:29.755 --> 00:15:33.345\nthen you have these interdependent\nrelationships that may be charging.\n\n276\n00:15:33.345 --> 00:15:38.276\n[SOUND] Just when I thought\nthings were gonna get simple, Jo.\n\n277\n00:15:38.276 --> 00:15:40.620\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's not a difficult concept.\n\n278\n00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:45.091\nWho are we actually\nproviding a service to?\n\n279\n00:15:45.091 --> 00:15:46.980\n&gt;&gt; I would say the customer.\n\n280\n00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.840\n&gt;&gt; Right, the organization.\n\n281\n00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:55.300\nAnd so the organization has a contract\nwith the service integrator.\n\n282\n00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.730\nSo everything else is a sub-contract.\n\n283\n00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:03.420\nAll the contracts between the service\nintegrator and each service provider, but\n\n284\n00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.320\nthat's a sub-contract.\n\n285\n00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.130\nAnd so of course the customer has\nto have oversight of all of this,\n\n286\n00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.760\neven though the customer doesn't\nnecessarily want to be bothered with\n\n287\n00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.950\nthe management of all of that.\n\n288\n00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.830\nThat's why they're paying\nthe service integrator.\n\n289\n00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.360\nNevertheless, they need to have\noversight over all of this,\n\n290\n00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.950\nbecause ultimately\nthey're paying the bill.\n\n291\n00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.650\nSo, that makes sense, really,\nwhen you think about it.\n\n292\n00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:29.543\nFinancial management not only has\nto manage all of the accounting and\n\n293\n00:16:29.543 --> 00:16:30.490\nthe budgeting.\n\n294\n00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:35.665\nFinancial management also has to\nmanage data and confidentiality and\n\n295\n00:16:35.665 --> 00:16:40.540\nsecurity of financial data,\nright across the ecosystem.\n\n296\n00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.510\nSo if we take a look at the purpose\nof financial management,\n\n297\n00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.950\nyou say that there are activities\nto do with collating and\n\n298\n00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:51.450\ninvestigating and analyzing and\npresenting information to the customer.\n\n299\n00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:56.980\nWhen we talk about an end-to-end financial\nfunction and what we mean by end-to-end\n\n300\n00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:02.940\nis we made collation of the information\nfrom all of our services providers.\n\n301\n00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.150\nAnd of course,\nthat's the key with the ecosystem,\n\n302\n00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:10.320\nis that when SIAM,\nwe've got many service providers.\n\n303\n00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:15.040\nIn a traditional approach, and\na traditional approach to IT,\n\n304\n00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.870\nwe've got one service provider, and\nthen we may have multiple sub-vendors,\n\n305\n00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:23.860\nbut we got one service\nprovider that's part of IT.\n\n306\n00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:25.530\nWe don't have this.\n\n307\n00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:29.480\nSo, we're managing across\nmultiple contracts.\n\n308\n00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.450\nAnd because we've got multiple contracts,\n\n309\n00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:36.250\nthat means the financial management is\ngonna have to manage relationships and\n\n310\n00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.790\nalso penalties and\nincentives across those contracts as well.\n\n311\n00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:40.400\n&gt;&gt; So generally,\n\n312\n00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.890\nthat thus seem like a very important\nprocess that we need to consider.\n\n313\n00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.520\nHowever, where does this\nprocess actually leave us?\n\n314\n00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.670\nIs in the service integrator layer or\nwill this be at the customer layer.\n\n315\n00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.670\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nit's a bit of both because as I've said,\n\n316\n00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.770\nthe contracts themselves\nare owned by the customer.\n\n317\n00:17:54.770 --> 00:18:00.410\nSo the customer's going to do\na modicum of financial management,\n\n318\n00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.720\nand a modicum of the management\nof all of the finance processes.\n\n319\n00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.680\nThey own the budget, they own the money.\n\n320\n00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.108\nHowever, the management of\nthe actual contracts themselves, and\n\n321\n00:18:11.108 --> 00:18:16.546\nactually accounting for the money that we\nspent and ensuring that all of our working\n\n322\n00:18:16.546 --> 00:18:21.458\npractices, well, they are all followed\nby all of our service providers.\n\n323\n00:18:21.458 --> 00:18:23.951\nThat's going to lie with\nthe service integrator layer.\n\n324\n00:18:23.951 --> 00:18:26.692\nThat's definitely their\nresponsibility to do.\n\n325\n00:18:26.692 --> 00:18:29.520\n&gt;&gt; Though I can definitely\nsee how that makes sense for\n\n326\n00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.130\nthat leaving both of those layers\ndepending on respective considerations.\n\n327\n00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:38.440\nNow, we've talked about event management,\nwe've talked about financial management,\n\n328\n00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.010\nand I'm kind of interested\non where do we go from here?\n\n329\n00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:46.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, well in our next episode we're\ngonna be taking a look at security\n\n330\n00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.900\nmanagement and we're also gonna take a\nlook at some knowledge management as well.\n\n331\n00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:55.765\n&gt;&gt; Well Jo, I'm very interested to see\nwhat knowledge management actually is.\n\n332\n00:18:55.765 --> 00:18:58.890\nIt's one of those terms with,\nmaybe I know what it is,\n\n333\n00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.145\nbut I've never just actually\ncalled it knowledge management.\n\n334\n00:19:01.145 --> 00:19:02.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm starting to see\n\n335\n00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.630\nanother pattern here.\n\n336\n00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.404\nA lot of these are kind of interdependent,\nand security management,\n\n337\n00:19:06.404 --> 00:19:09.940\nfinancial management, there's probably\nsecurity in financial management, right?\n\n338\n00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:10.520\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n339\n00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.900\n&gt;&gt; Making sure you have\nfinancial data secure, but\n\n340\n00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.630\nyou have to make considerations for\nthose respective domains.\n\n341\n00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.780\nSo, definitely join us back as we\ncontinue looking at SIAM processes.\n\n342\n00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.470\nBut, for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n343\n00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:24.370\nSo, signing off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n344\n00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.290\n&gt;&gt;

management.\n\n13\n00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.610\nAnd here to help us along is Ms.\nJo Peacock.\n\n14\n00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.940\nHow you doing today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Justin.\n\n15\n00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.030\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n16\n00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.420\nNow I know knowledge management has peaked\nmy interest, but security management,\n\n17\n00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.620\nwe see news stories all the time\nabout whoops, people make mistakes.\n\n18\n00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.040\nSecurity management is probably super,\nsuper important in the grand scheme,\n\n19\n00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.920\nnot only as its own thing, but\nalso in context to other processes that\n\n20\n00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.610\nwe're actually implementing, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're right.\n\n21\n00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.820\nSecurity is not actually just\nabout the security of the offices,\n\n22\n00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.350\nit's not just about\ngetting into the building.\n\n23\n00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.790\nAnd it's not even about necessarily\nthe security of our services,\n\n24\n00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.220\nalthough that is part of it but\nit's also about the security of our data.\n\n25\n00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.090\nWe refer to it as the CIA,\nthe confidentiality,\n\n26\n00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.710\nthe integrity and the availability of\nour data, making sure that our data is\n\n27\n00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.090\navailable only to those that\nshould have access to it.\n\n28\n00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.940\nAnd that it's not available\nto absolutely everybody.\n\n29\n00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.051\nThis is paramount.\n\n30\n00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:36.317\nThis is incredibly important when\nit comes to the SIAM ecosystem,\n\n31\n00:01:36.317 --> 00:01:41.370\nbecause in the SIAM ecosystem,\nwe have multiple service providers.\n\n32\n00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.990\nAnd therefore, our data is going from\none service provider to another,\n\n33\n00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.330\nto another, to another.\n\n34\n00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.320\nWe have instances where we may be\ninsisting that our service provider use\n\n35\n00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.320\nour tools, as the service integrator or\neven as a customer.\n\n36\n00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.790\nThen the service provider\nmay use our tools.\n\n37\n00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.430\nHowever, the service provider\nmay want to use their tools and\n\n38\n00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.370\ntherefore will be transferring data.\n\n39\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.390\nAnd that data maybe subject to some form\nof translation that goes into their tools.\n\n40\n00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.600\nAnd what other data is in their tools?\n\n41\n00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.070\nHow can we ensure\nthe integrity of our data?\n\n42\n00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.180\nHow can we ensure that our data is not\nmixed up with somebody else's data?\n\n43\n00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.360\nWe don't wanna see somebody else's data.\n\n44\n00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.970\nWe don't want to have access\nto somebody else's data.\n\n45\n00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.830\nBut then at the same time,\n\n46\n00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.237\nwe don't want anybody else to\nhave access to our data either.\n\n47\n00:02:30.237 --> 00:02:33.380\nSo we've got to ensure\nthe integrity of our data.\n\n48\n00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.740\nWe don't want anybody else's\ndata infiltrating into ours.\n\n49\n00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.130\nNow to us, the security of someone\nelse's data isn't a concern.\n\n50\n00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.960\nHowever, it should be.\n\n51\n00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.450\nBecause if you see somebody else's\ndata is getting into ours, and\n\n52\n00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.920\nmixing in with ours, then there's\na good chance that ours might be\n\n53\n00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.330\ngetting into their data sources, as well.\n\n54\n00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.840\nSo when we are in the SIAM ecosystem,\nwe've got to be incredibly careful and\n\n55\n00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.600\nwe've got to be very aware of\nhow our data is being moved from\n\n56\n00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.500\none service provider to the next.\n\n57\n00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.980\nAnd of course, how our data is being moved\nmay actually have a direct impact on\n\n58\n00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.700\nhow that service provider is\nmanaging their other customers, too.\n\n59\n00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.040\nIf we're all on the same system,\nthe same tool in that service provider,\n\n60\n00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.540\nthen we also have other customers'\ndata tha,t as we've already said,\n\n61\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.718\ncould have influence on our data.\n\n62\n00:03:29.718 --> 00:03:31.877\nSo [COUGH] in security,\n\n63\n00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:37.990\nwe have to consider the security\nof our service providers.\n\n64\n00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.040\nThis is not just a case of looking\nafter our own data security.\n\n65\n00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.520\nThis is also a case of\nlooking after theirs as well.\n\n66\n00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.410\nNow let's say that we were\nin an environment and\n\n67\n00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.960\nthat customer environment will\nsay ISO 20000 accredited.\n\n68\n00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.430\nAnd as an ISO 20000\naccredited service provider,\n\n69\n00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.530\nthen what that means is that we have to\nhave certain levels of security, maybe\n\n70\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.800\neven ISO 27002 accredited which is the\ninternational standard for IT security.\n\n71\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.930\nAnd then if we are accredited,\nif the customer's accredited for\n\n72\n00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.910\nISO 27002 then that means that\nthe behavior of our service integrator and\n\n73\n00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.490\nthe behavior of our service providers\nwill also have a direct impact on\n\n74\n00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:27.520\nour ability to retain ISO [COUGH] 20000 or\nISO 27002.\n\n75\n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.410\nSo we will have outside parties\n\n76\n00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.260\nthat influence our ability\nto attain our accreditation.\n\n77\n00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.250\nSo that's something else that\nwe've gotta bring into that mix.\n\n78\n00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.390\nSo if we take a look at the purpose\nof security management,\n\n79\n00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.330\nyou'll see that security\nmanagement monitors and\n\n80\n00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.790\nensures adherence to security policies and\nprocesses.\n\n81\n00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.860\nWe also have a tie in within\nincident management as well.\n\n82\n00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.600\nBecause when something happens in\nsecurity, whatever that may be,\n\n83\n00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.210\nwe have to manage it as though it\nwas an incident, because it is.\n\n84\n00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.520\nIt's an interruption to security policies.\n\n85\n00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.010\nAnd so it has to be managed as such.\n\n86\n00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.730\nWe know about things\nlike our password policy.\n\n87\n00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.790\nWe know what our passwords should be.\n\n88\n00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.300\nWe know about policies,\nthe very simple ones,\n\n89\n00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.170\nsuch as don't write your password down.\n\n90\n00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.490\nDon't give your password to somebody else.\n\n91\n00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.900\nBut there's lots of other policies\nas well to do with security.\n\n92\n00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.600\nSuch as, well,\nwe'll give you the ability to send and\n\n93\n00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.720\nreceive emails as long as you\ndon't download any viruses.\n\n94\n00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.650\nWe'll give you the ability to access\nthe Internet as long as you don't download\n\n95\n00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.860\nsomething that you\nshouldn't be downloading.\n\n96\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.020\nBut we keep all of these\nin our IT security policy.\n\n97\n00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.275\nSometimes it is called\nan acceptable usage policy, but\n\n98\n00:05:51.275 --> 00:05:54.261\ninvariably it's called in\nan IT security policy.\n\n99\n00:05:54.261 --> 00:05:57.780\nWho should have access to\nthat IT security policy?\n\n100\n00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.530\n&gt;&gt; Access as in regards to being able to\n\n101\n00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.650\nread it or understand,\ntake a look at it and\n\n102\n00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.700\nsee what is actually in that policy?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n103\n00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.530\n&gt;&gt; I would say everybody.\n\n104\n00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.770\n&gt;&gt; What do you mean by everybody?\n\n105\n00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.870\n&gt;&gt; So anybody who is using systems in\n\n106\n00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.490\ncontact with data,\n\n107\n00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.710\nwhere the IT security policy may impact\ntheir current accepectable usage for\n\n108\n00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.690\nthose respective systems or services.\n&gt;&gt; Now it's gonna get complex, because\n\n109\n00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:30.320\nactually I mean literally everybody.\n&gt;&gt; So as a customer,\n\n110\n00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.080\neverybody that accesses your services,\nanybody\n\n111\n00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.450\nwho walks into your building should\nhave access to your IT security policy.\n\n112\n00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.330\nCuz anybody that walks into your building,\nwell,\n\n113\n00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.430\ncould potentially gain\naccess to your network.\n\n114\n00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.130\nLet's face it, we work on Wi-Fi nowadays,\nand everybody works on Wi-Fi.\n\n115\n00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.120\nSo anybody could walk\ninto your building and\n\n116\n00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:58.200\ngain access using their cell phone to\nyour Wi-Fi router, or your Wi-Fi router.\n\n117\n00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.485\nIf they are particularly good at hacking,\n\n118\n00:07:01.485 --> 00:07:05.510\n[LAUGH] then they could definitely\nget into your router, or your router.\n\n119\n00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.320\nWell, that's okay.\n\n120\n00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.090\nYou can control what happens at your site,\nright?\n\n121\n00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.540\nSo anybody should have\naccess to that policy.\n\n122\n00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.360\nSo anybody that connects to the router,\nshould then get that pop-up that says,\n\n123\n00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.190\nokay, you can use this Wi-Fi, but\nthese are the terms and conditions.\n\n124\n00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.520\nThere's your security policy.\n\n125\n00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.860\nAnd as I said, that's just at your site.\n&gt;&gt; What about\n\n126\n00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.580\nall of those service\nproviders that we have?\n\n127\n00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:40.260\nIs it my job as the security\nmanager in this service integrator,\n\n128\n00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:46.270\nis it my job to ensure that\nall of my service providers\n\n129\n00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:51.170\nhave individual security policies?\n&gt;&gt; Individual in the context of it\n\n130\n00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.180\napplies to them or that I have\ndistributed a more generic security\n\n131\n00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.820\npolicy to each one of them?\n&gt;&gt; Both.\n\n132\n00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, there, here we go.\n\n133\n00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:10.200\nSo I would think it is unlikely, thinking\nin the terms of this, it is unlikely\n\n134\n00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.070\nthat someone will read a security policy\nthat is a composite of all the policies\n\n135\n00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.910\nthat apply to every service provider.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n136\n00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.905\n&gt;&gt; So I would say that at the service\n\n137\n00:08:19.905 --> 00:08:24.279\nintegrator level, you're gonna have\npolicies that apply to particular services\n\n138\n00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.655\n&gt;&gt; And that those are available [SOUND]\n\n139\n00:08:28.655 --> 00:08:33.405\nand get, and\nhave a generic blanket one for all.\n\n140\n00:08:33.405 --> 00:08:37.416\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so here I am then, we're here,\n\n141\n00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:43.861\nITProTV, and I am putting myself in a\nposition of service integrator at ITProTV.\n\n142\n00:08:43.861 --> 00:08:48.480\nAnd we have a number of service providers,\na number of suppliers.\n\n143\n00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:54.480\nSo I'm going to pick a particular\nservice provider that we could have.\n\n144\n00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.920\nI don't know,\nlet's pick British Telecom, okay?\n\n145\n00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.650\nJust purely because we're not in the UK,\nso\n\n146\n00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.090\ntherefore we'll pick\na UK service provider.\n\n147\n00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.350\nSo I've got British Telecom,\nthey're one of my service providers.\n\n148\n00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:13.717\nI am the service integrator,\nit is my job to\n\n149\n00:09:13.717 --> 00:09:20.575\nensure that anybody that goes\nonto any British Telecom\n\n150\n00:09:20.575 --> 00:09:25.807\nsite has access to an IT security policy.\n\n151\n00:09:25.807 --> 00:09:31.459\nDo you know why?\n&gt;&gt; So are we talking from the respective,\n\n152\n00:09:31.459 --> 00:09:34.729\nlet's say from service-\n&gt;&gt; I'm the service integrator for\n\n153\n00:09:34.729 --> 00:09:35.900\nITPro TV.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n154\n00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.150\nsomeone associated with you?\n&gt;&gt; And BT is one of my service providers.\n\n155\n00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\n\n156\n00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.020\nis it your job to make sure\nthat they provide a security\n\n157\n00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.395\npolicy to anybody that shows up to them?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n158\n00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.460\nDo you know why?\n&gt;&gt; Because ultimately,\n\n159\n00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.500\nit boils down to their actions.\n\n160\n00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.440\nIf this is your process,\nthen they have to adhere to your\n\n161\n00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.650\nprocess for this, right?\n&gt;&gt; It's got nothing to do with the process\n\n162\n00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.960\nnecessarily, and\neverything to do with the data.\n\n163\n00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.640\nBT's got access to my data,\nthey're one of my service providers.\n\n164\n00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.322\nThat means that anybody that walks\nonto a BT site could potentially have\n\n165\n00:10:12.322 --> 00:10:14.380\naccess to my data.\n\n166\n00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.710\nSo it's not about what's right or\nwrong again.\n\n167\n00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:23.220\nWhat it is is about, well,\nwhat makes sense for the organization.\n\n168\n00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.890\nThis is not about\nfollowing a specific rule,\n\n169\n00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:30.220\nthis is about the fact\nthat this is ITPro's data.\n\n170\n00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:35.420\nITProTV's data is on a server,\na British Telecom, so therefore,\n\n171\n00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.910\nit's my job as the service\nintegrator to protect that data.\n\n172\n00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:46.040\nSo it's my job to ensure that only\nthose that should have access to it\n\n173\n00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.630\ncan get access to it.\n\n174\n00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:52.370\nSo if that means that I've got to ensure,\nI've gotta make sure that BT,\n\n175\n00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:57.330\nBritish Telecom, do not allow\nanybody else access to that data,\n\n176\n00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.370\nthen of course I'm gonna\nget involved in that.\n\n177\n00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:05.628\nAnd that means that as service integrator,\nI am going to be looking at BT's\n\n178\n00:11:05.628 --> 00:11:10.600\nsecurity policy and ensuring that\nthat is adequate enough for us.\n\n179\n00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.990\nBecause if it's not,\nthen I'm not going to sign it and\n\n180\n00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.530\nI'm not going to use them as\na service provider either.\n\n181\n00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.321\nData security is,\n\n182\n00:11:20.321 --> 00:11:25.780\nyou mentioned it when we did our\nintroduction to this particular episode.\n\n183\n00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.335\nData security is in the news, but\nit's been in the news for years.\n\n184\n00:11:29.335 --> 00:11:33.835\nIt's always in the news and\nwe hear quite frequently of security\n\n185\n00:11:33.835 --> 00:11:38.510\nbreaches where data has been compromised\nand where our personal information or\n\n186\n00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:42.940\nwhere credit information,\nwhere medical information is\n\n187\n00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.870\ngiven to somebody else that we\ndon't want them to have access to.\n\n188\n00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:51.440\nAnd one of the ways that that happens\nis through service providers.\n\n189\n00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:58.310\nAnd it's simply because we don't\nconsider the needs of our customer\n\n190\n00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:04.270\norganization when we are considering our\ncontracts with our service providers.\n\n191\n00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.220\nIt makes sense when you think about it.\n\n192\n00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.270\nAnd now I'm not saying that this\nis something that's going to be\n\n193\n00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:14.760\neasy to implement necessarily, but it\nmakes sense when you're thinking about it.\n\n194\n00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.280\nLet's take this and\nput this into the real world then.\n\n195\n00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.623\nHow do we enforce that in the real world?\n&gt;&gt; That's s a tricky question because,\n\n196\n00:12:23.623 --> 00:12:25.900\nlet me make sure I understand.\n\n197\n00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:30.390\nHow do I enforce that,\nlet's take British Telecom,\n\n198\n00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:34.540\nis providing a security policy\nthat everybody that walks on site,\n\n199\n00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.900\nbecause of the ramifications\nthat it has for\n\n200\n00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.520\nyour company as a service integrator.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n201\n00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.650\n&gt;&gt; That's tricky.\n\n202\n00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.725\nDo you send in plants?\n\n203\n00:12:45.725 --> 00:12:47.439\n[LAUGH] I don't-\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n204\n00:12:47.439 --> 00:12:49.170\nsome organizations have done that.\n\n205\n00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.850\nSome organizations do.\n\n206\n00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.640\nAnd there have been some very famous\ncases where organizations have said, no,\n\n207\n00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.900\nwe've got the most secure network in the\nworld, and that's exactly what's happened\n\n208\n00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:04.290\nis that professional hackers have been\nengaged to come into the organization and\n\n209\n00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.290\ntest certain pieces of security.\n\n210\n00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.220\nAnd you know what the most\neffective hacker is?\n\n211\n00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.248\n&gt;&gt; The one that walks in the building and\n\n212\n00:13:13.248 --> 00:13:15.370\ngets access to the mainframe?\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\n\n213\n00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.710\nthe walks that walks into the building\npretending to be somebody else.\n\n214\n00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.934\nThey're the most effective hacker.\n\n215\n00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:26.147\nAnd there's been some quite high publicity\ncases of that as well where we can\n\n216\n00:13:26.147 --> 00:13:31.452\nget people that would be sitting there\ntrying to hack into certain networks.\n\n217\n00:13:31.452 --> 00:13:36.820\nHowever, it is the person that has got\nthe bravado to walk into the door and\n\n218\n00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.559\nsay hi, I'm Joe.\n\n219\n00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:41.490\nI'm from wherever, and\nthen wants to get access.\n\n220\n00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.380\nThat's how it works.\n\n221\n00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.110\nThat's what security should be doing.\n\n222\n00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.440\nSecurity should be\ntesting security as well.\n\n223\n00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.150\nAnd we should be testing security,\n\n224\n00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:55.230\nnot just on our services, but also on\nthe services of our service providers.\n\n225\n00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:59.840\nBecause if our service providers have\na security breach with our data,\n\n226\n00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.770\nthat's our fault.\n\n227\n00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.380\nIt's our responsibility\nbecause it's our data.\n\n228\n00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:09.860\nAnd if we're talking about customer data,\nthen unfortunately we're responsible for\n\n229\n00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.830\nthat customer data.\n\n230\n00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.700\nWe may have handed that\nresponsibility over to somebody else,\n\n231\n00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.790\nbut ultimately we're the ones that\nare held accountable for that.\n\n232\n00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:18.500\nSo therefore,\n\n233\n00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.820\nwe have got to ensure security in\nthat service integrator layout.\n\n234\n00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.810\nWe have to ensure security.\n\n235\n00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.000\nWe can't expect the customer\nlayer to do that.\n\n236\n00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.890\nWe do not expect the customer to have the\ntechnical wherewithal and knowledge and\n\n237\n00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.970\nexpertise to be able to\nmanage their security.\n\n238\n00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.450\nThat's down to us to do.\n\n239\n00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.000\nSo we take ownership of that.\n\n240\n00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.570\nAnd we've talked about data and\nwe've talked about data extensively, so\n\n241\n00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:47.240\nI wanna bring in knowledge management,\nbecause knowledge management is all about\n\n242\n00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:52.379\ncapturing data and ensuring that\nthat data is available for us so\n\n243\n00:14:52.379 --> 00:14:58.320\nthat we can use it to make decisions\nas and when we need to use that data.\n\n244\n00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.310\nIt's about it being available again.\n\n245\n00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:05.570\nIt's the availability of our\ndata in a manner that everyone\n\n246\n00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.010\nwho needs to have access to\nthat data can have access.\n\n247\n00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:13.200\nSo Justin,\nI mentioned about informed decisionmaking.\n\n248\n00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.750\nWhat do you think I mean\nby informed decisions?\n\n249\n00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.830\n&gt;&gt; So we're taking previous experiences,\n\n250\n00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.190\nprevious knowledge that we've\ngained through those experiences,\n\n251\n00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:28.148\nin order to inform future decisions for\nkind of,\n\n252\n00:15:28.148 --> 00:15:32.670\nI don't want to say activities, for\n\n253\n00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:36.340\nlike situations.\n&gt;&gt; I kind of like the way you went, but\n\n254\n00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.367\nthen you stumbled a little bit.\n&gt;&gt; Well, my mind sometimes doesn't work\n\n255\n00:15:40.367 --> 00:15:42.271\nas fast as my mouth.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n256\n00:15:42.271 --> 00:15:42.910\n&gt;&gt; So that's-\n\n257\n00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.790\n&gt;&gt; No, I like the way you went there.\n\n258\n00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.760\nIt is about previous experiences and\nprevious insights, etc.\n\n259\n00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.870\nBut what we want to do is we want to,\n\n260\n00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.560\nthere's a word up there on\nthat first bullet point.\n\n261\n00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.035\nWe want to capture that.\n\n262\n00:15:55.035 --> 00:15:57.470\nWe want to capture previous experiences.\n\n263\n00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:01.190\nWe want to capture sort\nof previous data and\n\n264\n00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:06.180\nknowledge so that we can then use that\nwhen we need to, which is why it talks\n\n265\n00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:11.030\nabout appropriate people, but we also want\nto talk about appropriate timings as well.\n\n266\n00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:15.440\nSo we can use that when we need\nto to make informed decisions.\n\n267\n00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.200\nAnd that's what knowledge\nmanagement is about.\n\n268\n00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.330\nIt's about ensuring that we have got\nthe right information at our fingertips.\n\n269\n00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:27.234\nBut again, we can link that back to\nsecurity, and we can link it back\n\n270\n00:16:27.234 --> 00:16:32.390\nto our knowing and having confidence\nin the fact that the data that we have,\n\n271\n00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:37.520\nthe experiences that we've recorded\nas data, and all of that information\n\n272\n00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.730\nthat we have at our fingertips, well, we\ncan be assured of the integrity of that.\n\n273\n00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:43.680\nAnd that's what we want.\n\n274\n00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.850\nAnd this is why we'll put\nsecurity management and\n\n275\n00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:48.780\nknowledge management together.\n\n276\n00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:52.680\nBecause knowledge management and\nthe value of knowledge management is\n\n277\n00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.670\ndependent completely on the security and\nthe integrity of the data.\n\n278\n00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:00.440\nAnd without security management,\nthen we can't be sure of the integrity of\n\n279\n00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.415\nthe data.\n&gt;&gt; I can see that round.\n\n280\n00:17:03.415 --> 00:17:09.500\nWould it also be true that security\nmanagement could be better informed if we\n\n281\n00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:15.240\ncapture things that, maybe security\nissues that have cropped up or things\n\n282\n00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:20.180\nthat we discover about existing practices\nthat may be with security issues?\n\n283\n00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.560\nCan that also go back the other way?\n\n284\n00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.320\nCan this be a diagraph?\n&gt;&gt; Right, it can, but\n\n285\n00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.740\nyou're kinda getting into the realms\nof incident management, and\n\n286\n00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.700\nwe're saving that one for\nour next episode.\n\n287\n00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:35.830\nSo what you're telling me is, we've had a\npretty good glimpse at security management\n\n288\n00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:39.600\nand knowledge management and kind of\ntheir interdependence of each other.\n\n289\n00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.870\nAnd now we need to move forward to\ntalk about incident management and\n\n290\n00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.210\nproblem management?\n&gt;&gt; We do,\n\n291\n00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:45.810\nyes.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n292\n00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:50.890\nI'm looking forward to it because I know\nI've mixed up those words multiple times.\n\n293\n00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:54.460\nAnd so finally drilling down\non the fine point details\n\n294\n00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.050\nwill help us kind of understand\nthese processes better.\n\n295\n00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:00.310\nSo definitely join us back next time,\nbut for now we're gonna go ahead and\n\n296\n00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.160\nget out of here.\n\n297\n00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.000\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n298\n00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.910\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n299\n00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.976\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n300\n00:18:06.976 -->

00:00:12.010\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.180\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.440\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and we're\ncontinuing on with our SIAM processes.\n\n6\n00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.560\nAnd well we're gonna be talking about\nincident management in this episode.\n\n7\n00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.260\nAnd as someone who has\nhad some interesting\n\n8\n00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.110\ninteractions with incidence, luckily\nit's not me who's teaching all about it.\n\n9\n00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.070\nWe actually have someone\nvery special in the studio,\n\n10\n00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.660\nthe one, the only, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.920\nHow you doing today, Jo?\n\n12\n00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.450\n&gt;&gt; I'm fine thank you, Justin.\n\n13\n00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.190\nHow are you?\n\n14\n00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.145\nI'm scared.\n\n15\n00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:43.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I am doing fantastic.\n\n16\n00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.390\nAnd as someone whose kind\nof mixed the problems and\n\n17\n00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.447\nincidents and-\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n\n18\n00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:48.091\n&gt;&gt; Things,\n\n19\n00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:50.510\nI know, I know, absolute heresy.\n\n20\n00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.030\n&gt;&gt; I'm dying here.\n\n21\n00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.990\n&gt;&gt; Can you make sure that we're all\nthe same playing field when we're talking\n\n22\n00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.889\nabout incidents before we kinda\ndive into incidence management?\n\n23\n00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.493\n&gt;&gt; Talk about incidence before we\ndive into incident management?\n\n24\n00:01:01.493 --> 00:01:06.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just to make sure we're all on\nthe same, just kind of on level, right.\n\n25\n00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.640\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, well look,\nI'll tell you what, let me try and\n\n26\n00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.180\nmake this is a little bit clearer for you.\n\n27\n00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.960\nIncidence and\n\n28\n00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.150\nproblems, two completely different things,\ncompletely different things.\n\n29\n00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.610\nIn this episode we're going to\nlook at incident management.\n\n30\n00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.240\nAnd I would always recommend, and I know\nthat in our last episode I said to you,\n\n31\n00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.910\nright, we're gonna cover incident and\nproblem management next.\n\n32\n00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.760\nBecause I would always recommend\nthat you look at incident and\n\n33\n00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.990\nproblem management together.\n\n34\n00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.170\nIt's really important because they are so\nheavily intertwined.\n\n35\n00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.240\nYou cannot have an incident\nwithout a problem.\n\n36\n00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.770\nBut what is the difference between\nan incident and a problem?\n\n37\n00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.410\nHow many times have you called\nup the service desk and\n\n38\n00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.500\nyou said to the person on the service\ndesk, I've got a problem.\n\n39\n00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.620\nBut you haven't,\n\n40\n00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.040\nwhat you have is an incident and\nit's been caused by a problem.\n\n41\n00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.235\nSo an incident is an interruption to\nservice, it's something that has failed.\n\n42\n00:02:02.235 --> 00:02:07.457\nIt's something that has\ninterrupted your service,\n\n43\n00:02:07.457 --> 00:02:13.900\nor it's something that could\ninterrupt your service.\n\n44\n00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.460\nAn incident is an event.\n\n45\n00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.770\nAn event is something that's happened.\n\n46\n00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.590\nAn event,\nif you remember from previous episode,\n\n47\n00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.290\nis a change of state that has significance\nfor the management of the infrastructure.\n\n48\n00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.870\nSo an event is something that's happened.\n\n49\n00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.700\nAnd in this case, an incident is\nan event where something has failed,\n\n50\n00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.120\nwhere service has been interrupted.\n\n51\n00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.300\nIt's what we would call an exceptional\nevent, it's caused a failure.\n\n52\n00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.540\nWell no, the event is the failure.\n\n53\n00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.020\nThe problem however is what's caused it.\n\n54\n00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.910\nSo before we get too far into incident\nmanagement, we're gonna just look\n\n55\n00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.050\nat an incident and a problem and we're\ngonna look at the difference between them.\n\n56\n00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.925\nAn incident is\nan interruption to a service.\n\n57\n00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:02.053\nService is defined where?\n\n58\n00:03:02.053 --> 00:03:09.455\n&gt;&gt; A service is defined, I guess,\nat the service provider level or\n\n59\n00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:13.850\nam I misunderstanding the question?\n\n60\n00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.670\nI say that and Jo goes, [SOUND].\n\n61\n00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I did.\n\n62\n00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.490\nI did.\n\n63\n00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.460\n&gt;&gt; She did.\nSo repeat your question.\n\n64\n00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.010\nLet me make sure I\nunderstand the question.\n\n65\n00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.230\n&gt;&gt; Where do we define the service?\n\n66\n00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.160\nWhat I said was that an incident\nwas an interruption to a service.\n\n67\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.393\nAnd where is that service defined?\n\n68\n00:03:33.393 --> 00:03:35.230\nLet me rephrase it.\n\n69\n00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.660\nCan you see the look of confusion?\n\n70\n00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.710\nWhere is the service agreed?\n\n71\n00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.830\n&gt;&gt; I guess at the customer level?\n\n72\n00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.459\n&gt;&gt; I don't-\n&gt;&gt; The customer,\n\n73\n00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.333\nsee this is where things get-\n&gt;&gt; I gave you the words.\n\n74\n00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:52.670\n&gt;&gt; Service integrator?\n\n75\n00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.650\nYou gave me the words.\n\n76\n00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.140\nWhere is it defined?\n\n77\n00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:03.650\n&gt;&gt; In the SLA,\nthe service level agreement.\n\n78\n00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.070\nService-\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n79\n00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.750\n&gt;&gt; Is defined in the agreement.\n\n80\n00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.150\nOr so\nthe service is agreed in the agreement.\n\n81\n00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.440\n&gt;&gt; I see what happened here,\nI see what happened here.\n\n82\n00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.280\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you do.\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking on a different level\n\n83\n00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.420\nthan you were.\n\n84\n00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.125\nBut I get what you're-\n&gt;&gt; It's not that unusual\n\n85\n00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:20.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not.\n\n86\n00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.150\nI get what you're saying, right,\nthe service is agreed upon in those SLA's.\n\n87\n00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.115\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because you were providing this and\n\n88\n00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:27.887\nthis is my expectations of said thing.\n\n89\n00:04:27.887 --> 00:04:32.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, yes.\n\n90\n00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.130\nA service level agreement, and we'll look\nat this when you check out the episode\n\n91\n00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.690\nwhere we look at service level agreement,\nbut it's an agreement between two parties.\n\n92\n00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.860\nIt's an agreement.\n\n93\n00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.320\nSo in most instances,\nin the Siam ecosystem,\n\n94\n00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.870\nan SLA is an agreement between\nthe customer and the service integrator.\n\n95\n00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.870\nAnd the service integrator says,\nI'm gonna provide you with this service.\n\n96\n00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.640\nAnd the customer says, okay, and\nI'm going to agree to take that service.\n\n97\n00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.734\nSo we might have an availability service\nlevel target within that SLA that says\n\n98\n00:05:02.734 --> 00:05:06.644\nthat this service is gonna be available\nbetween the hours of 08:00 and\n\n99\n00:05:06.644 --> 00:05:07.777\n20:00, okay.\n\n100\n00:05:07.777 --> 00:05:12.876\nThat's an availability target.\n\n101\n00:05:12.876 --> 00:05:16.481\nSo an interruption to that service then,\nan incident,\n\n102\n00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:19.550\nis an interruption to that service.\n\n103\n00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.860\nSo an incident will interrupt\nthe service as defined in the SLA.\n\n104\n00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.940\nSo if the service is the defined in the\nSLA is for, let's say, my email service to\n\n105\n00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.150\nbe available between 8 in the morning and\n20:00, 8 in the evening.\n\n106\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.230\nThen if email, and\nI trying get into email let's say\n\n107\n00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.940\n10 o’clock at night Has my\nservice been interrupted?\n\n108\n00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.900\n&gt;&gt; I would say no because that's\nnot the agreed upon time frame.\n\n109\n00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.940\n&gt;&gt; Right, this is why it's really\nimportant that the SLA is agreed.\n\n110\n00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.960\nBecause otherwise if I don't\nknow what my service is,\n\n111\n00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.890\nthen how do I know if\nit's been interrupted?\n\n112\n00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.350\n&gt;&gt; This is true and I think where, I can\nattest to this, where people get into\n\n113\n00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.740\ntrouble is when I think of a service,\nand we've talked about this before,\n\n114\n00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:18.030\nI think of these kind of concrete examples\nwhere I have made the assumption that\n\n115\n00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.280\nthey're just available to me because\nI'm gaining access to something.\n\n116\n00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.294\nLike some sort of cloud service or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n117\n00:06:23.294 --> 00:06:28.110\nBut that's not always true because there's\nalways like a, do you agree to terms and\n\n118\n00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.720\nconditions?\n\n119\n00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.910\nThere's always possibility for\nmaintenance or things of that nature.\n\n120\n00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.620\nAnd maybe because I'm agreeing to that,\n\n121\n00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.380\nI've technically haven't had my service\ninterrupted because I agreed to say, yeah,\n\n122\n00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.350\nit's only available except for these two\nhours of the day or whatever it may be.\n\n123\n00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.170\n&gt;&gt; Right, this is why the SLA is so\nimportant to incident management.\n\n124\n00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:53.020\nCuz incident management is about\nrestoring normal service operation,\n\n125\n00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.900\nwhile normal service operation is\ndefined in the service level agreement.\n\n126\n00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.964\nAnd so if normal service operation is for\nit to be available between the hours of\n\n127\n00:07:00.964 --> 00:07:06.460\n8:00 AM and 8:00 PM,\n20:00 hours, then if you can't\n\n128\n00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.660\nget in at 10:00 PM then unfortunately\nservice hasn't been interrupted.\n\n129\n00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.390\nBut more to the point, restoring normal\nservice operation means that we don't have\n\n130\n00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.180\nto get it up and\nrunning until 8:00 AM the next morning\n\n131\n00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.630\nanyway because that's what\nnormal service operation means.\n\n132\n00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.250\nSo yeah, okay, if you were Justin\nthen you could say, well look,\n\n133\n00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.930\nit's all in the fine print.\n\n134\n00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.690\nBut that's the reason for an SLA.\n\n135\n00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.760\nNo, it's not to cover ourselves.\n\n136\n00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.580\nThe reason for the SLA is to\nensure that there is no ambiguity.\n\n137\n00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.450\nThat we all understand what\nthe service really is,\n\n138\n00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:49.443\nand we all have the correct\naccurate expectations.\n\n139\n00:07:49.443 --> 00:07:54.073\nThat's for us in IT, for the service\nintegrator, and for our service provider,\n\n140\n00:07:54.073 --> 00:07:57.633\nwe have to ensure that we know\nWhat service we're providing but\n\n141\n00:07:57.633 --> 00:07:59.333\nit's also for the customer.\n\n142\n00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:02.982\nI have to know what I can expect and\nif I need it for\n\n143\n00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:08.200\ntwo hours later every evening,\nthen I need to renegotiate the SLA.\n\n144\n00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.230\nIt's not going to be managed\nby incident management.\n\n145\n00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.900\nIf somebody calls in at\n8:30 in the evening and\n\n146\n00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.780\nthen know that service is\nnot going to be available.\n\n147\n00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:25.060\nOr it might be, but it might be on a sort\nof a default basis because it was there.\n\n148\n00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.994\nAnd that's something else that happens as\nwell, is that you expect that because I\n\n149\n00:08:29.994 --> 00:08:35.162\nlog in at 5:00 every morning, and then I\ncheck my emails and I download my emails.\n\n150\n00:08:35.162 --> 00:08:36.818\nAnd they're always there,\n\n151\n00:08:36.818 --> 00:08:41.510\nthen there's an expectation there on\nbehalf of the customer that, yeah, but\n\n152\n00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:46.137\nit's always there so therefore if it's\nnot then service must be interrupted.\n\n153\n00:08:46.137 --> 00:08:47.600\nIt's not.\n\n154\n00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.515\nJust cuz you always happen\nto get access to email at at\n\n155\n00:08:52.515 --> 00:08:56.770\n5:00 in the morning doesn't\nmean that is the SLA,\n\n156\n00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:01.630\nthat that is the definition\nof normal service operation.\n\n157\n00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:06.514\nSo the SLA is so important to incident\nmanagement because without it\n\n158\n00:09:06.514 --> 00:09:10.553\nwe don't know whether a service\nhas been interrupted.\n\n159\n00:09:10.553 --> 00:09:13.590\nAnd we don't know when\na service has been restored.\n\n160\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.430\nSo let me give you an example then.\n\n161\n00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.358\nIncident management.\n\n162\n00:09:18.358 --> 00:09:19.940\nAnd we're gonna talk about incident and\n\n163\n00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.420\nour next step is we're gonna\ntalk about problem management.\n\n164\n00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.760\nThey are incredibly intertwined.\n\n165\n00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.630\nSo when I talk about incident and\nproblem here in this episode,\n\n166\n00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:32.330\nthe wording that I use is deliberate.\n\n167\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.720\nVery, very deliberate.\n\n168\n00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.825\nSo pay close attention cuz it's\nvery important that you understand\n\n169\n00:09:36.825 --> 00:09:37.650\nthe difference.\n\n170\n00:09:38.965 --> 00:09:43.440\nSo let's just say then, Justin,\nyou've called up the service desk.\n\n171\n00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.800\nAnd you normally,\nevery morning go to a printer,\n\n172\n00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.820\nwhich happens to be over in\nthe corner of the studio over there.\n\n173\n00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.730\nAnd you go and collect your report.\n\n174\n00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.690\nAnd your service is your report.\n\n175\n00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.390\nAnd this morning,\nyou called up the service desk, and\n\n176\n00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.290\nyou said to the service desk,\nwell I'm the service desk.\n\n177\n00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:08.440\nAnd you call me up and you said to me I\ndidn't get my report this morning, okay?\n\n178\n00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.145\nHas your service been interrupted?\n\n179\n00:10:10.145 --> 00:10:14.440\n&gt;&gt; Jo I feel like I'm not entirely sure\nI have enough information to answer this\n\n180\n00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.980\nbecause if the report is the service,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n181\n00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:23.062\n&gt;&gt; Then I need to know what the agreed,\nsee this whole report being-\n\n182\n00:10:23.062 --> 00:10:24.179\n&gt;&gt; I told you of the SLA,\n\n183\n00:10:24.179 --> 00:10:26.552\nI told you what normal\nservice operation is.\n\n184\n00:10:26.552 --> 00:10:29.892\nWhat I said to you was every\nmorning you go to that printer,\n\n185\n00:10:29.892 --> 00:10:33.070\nyou get your report, and\nyour service is your report.\n\n186\n00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.850\nThen this morning, you went to the printer\nand you didn't get your report.\n\n187\n00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.490\nSo if you didn't get your report,\nsimple yes or\n\n188\n00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.820\nno, has your service been interrupted?\n\n189\n00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.050\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna tentatively say yes,\n\n190\n00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.265\nbecause I feel like maybe I\nshouldn't go to work early today.\n\n191\n00:10:46.265 --> 00:10:49.490\n[LAUGH] Maybe it's\noutside the range of it.\n\n192\n00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.280\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; And this is how my analytical brain\n\n193\n00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.800\nworks, right?\n\n194\n00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.700\nIf we have these established parameters,\nbut I'm gonna say,\n\n195\n00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.400\nyes, it has been interrupted\nbecause it's not available to me.\n\n196\n00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.890\n&gt;&gt; Wow, took us a while didn't it.\n\n197\n00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.180\nTook us a while.\n\n198\n00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.730\nOkay, so your service's been interrupted.\n\n199\n00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:08.970\nOkay, this next bit is gonna be painful.\n\n200\n00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.480\nThat's a word of warning,\nright, to you there.\n\n201\n00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.950\nYou know how sometimes on TV programs you\nget this warning that there's going to\n\n202\n00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:20.470\nbe some sort of maybe issue or\nsomething in that yeah, yeah.\n\n203\n00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:21.190\nHere's a warning.\n\n204\n00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.160\nSo you've called up the service desk.\n\n205\n00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.530\nYour service has been interrupted.\n\n206\n00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.100\nYou don't have your report.\n\n207\n00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.460\nYour service is your report.\n\n208\n00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:36.180\nSo I'm going to diverge your\nreport to a printer and\n\n209\n00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.130\nthat printer happens to be down\nthe road in one of our other offices.\n\n210\n00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.619\nIt's about two miles away.\n\n211\n00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:44.695\nYou're gonna have to go in your car, and\n\n212\n00:11:44.695 --> 00:11:48.320\nyou go to the other office\na couple of miles down the road.\n\n213\n00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.563\nAnd you get your report.\n\n214\n00:11:51.563 --> 00:11:52.560\nThis is important.\n\n215\n00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.215\nHas your service been restored?\n\n216\n00:11:57.215 --> 00:11:59.974\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n217\n00:11:59.974 --> 00:12:03.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was expecting more pain than this.\n\n218\n00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.290\nGo on.\n\n219\n00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:08.362\n&gt;&gt; So, if the service is the report,\nI now have obtained my report and\n\n220\n00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:12.753\nthat is restoration of service,\nlike the actual, I had it right here.\n\n221\n00:12:12.753 --> 00:12:13.340\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes.\n\n222\n00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.759\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter whether it's the\nprinter in the corner, the printer down\n\n223\n00:12:16.759 --> 00:12:19.650\nthe road or how much effort I had\nto make to go to the other printer,\n\n224\n00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.772\nit's not the printer that's the service,\nit's the actual report.\n\n225\n00:12:22.772 --> 00:12:25.803\nSo once I have obtained that that morning-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n226\n00:12:25.803 --> 00:12:27.380\n&gt;&gt; My service has been restored.\n\n227\n00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:32.670\n&gt;&gt; Now, had that service been\ndescribed in the SLA as that report\n\n228\n00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:39.940\nof that printer over there, Then service\noperation would not have been restored.\n\n229\n00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.840\nBecause you wouldn't have got it from your\nusual printer because that's what was in\n\n230\n00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.890\nthe SLA.\n\n231\n00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:50.160\nSo it really is completely dependent on\nwhat's in the SLA, which is why it is so\n\n232\n00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.580\nimportant that normal service\noperation is defined in the SLA.\n\n233\n00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.670\nSo important.\n\n234\n00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.320\nSo, but\nthen we've still got an issue because\n\n235\n00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.390\nyou're now going a couple of miles\ndown the road to get a report.\n\n236\n00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.270\nWhat's wrong with that picture?\n\n237\n00:13:08.174 --> 00:13:11.914\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Well, it's very inconvenient\nfor me and it also takes time.\n\n238\n00:13:11.914 --> 00:13:14.504\nIt doesn't seem to be\nan efficient time process and\n\n239\n00:13:14.504 --> 00:13:16.900\nI don't know if that's consideration.\n\n240\n00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:17.780\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Me personally.\n\n241\n00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:22.244\n&gt;&gt; Well it is, but-\n&gt;&gt; I would get frustrated.\n\n242\n00:13:22.244 --> 00:13:23.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n243\n00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.560\n&gt;&gt; Just because it would\ntake that time that may\n\n244\n00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.420\nremove from other-\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n245\n00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.726\nyou'd really be frustrated just\nbecause it was gonna take some time?\n\n246\n00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.090\n&gt;&gt; I would, I know this sounds crazy.\n\n247\n00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:35.570\nHave you seen traffic out here?\n\n248\n00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.070\nIt's awful.\n\n249\n00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.178\nTwo miles down the road\nmight be a 40 minute drive.\n\n250\n00:13:40.178 --> 00:13:43.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but Justin most normal people\nwould just be incredibly frustrated\n\n251\n00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.460\nthat that printer wasn't working.\n\n252\n00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:47.485\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean that's an ancillary issue.\n\n253\n00:13:47.485 --> 00:13:49.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I have full expectations that\n\n254\n00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:55.430\nprinters don't work any time that I\nwant them to, but again, that's a bias.\n\n255\n00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.415\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes I wonder why I'm here.\n\n256\n00:13:57.415 --> 00:14:02.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just to statement sometimes.\n\n257\n00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:06.090\nMost people would be concerned\nthat that printer wasn't working.\n\n258\n00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.860\nMost people would actually be sign to bs.\n\n259\n00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.010\nBut Jo, that printer is not working.\n\n260\n00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:14.380\nAnd then I would normally turn around and\nsay, of course, I mean,\n\n261\n00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.490\nthis one doesn't work here.\n\n262\n00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.228\nBut I would normally turn and say, no,\n\n263\n00:14:17.228 --> 00:14:19.401\nthat's because we haven't\nfixed the problem.\n\n264\n00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.947\n&gt;&gt; Maybe we should pre-discuss\nthese things [LAUGH] And again,\n\n265\n00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:29.804\nI think this is expectation because I've\nnever had a great deal like with printers.\n\n266\n00:14:29.804 --> 00:14:33.202\nSo maybe it's just like eh, it's not\nworking, I figured it wouldn't work.\n\n267\n00:14:33.202 --> 00:14:36.438\n&gt;&gt; I don't get a great deal a lot\nwith hosts either but you know-\n\n268\n00:14:36.438 --> 00:14:37.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n269\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.300\n&gt;&gt; What can I say?\n\n270\n00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.940\nSo what we haven't done is,\n\n271\n00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:48.290\nwe've inconvenienced Justin right now,\neven though we've restored his service.\n\n272\n00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.070\nWe've given him his report.\n\n273\n00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.320\nThe fact is,\nthat Justin's still inconvenienced.\n\n274\n00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.040\nAnd you and I are still very confused.\n\n275\n00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.220\nJustin's still inconvenienced, why?\n\n276\n00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.980\nBecause we haven't fixed the problem.\n\n277\n00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:06.300\nBecause that printer has a problem.\n\n278\n00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:12.850\nAnd a problem is defined as the underlying\nroot cause of one or more incidents.\n\n279\n00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:18.557\nSo the incident is the fact\nthat the service isn't there.\n\n280\n00:15:18.557 --> 00:15:20.410\nThe service has been interrupted.\n\n281\n00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.460\nBut the problem is what caused it.\n\n282\n00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:28.140\nIt's the underlying\ncause of that incident.\n\n283\n00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.320\nAnd the underlying cause in this instance,\nand\n\n284\n00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.610\nwe're gonna carry this one on\ninto our next episode by the way.\n\n285\n00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:37.750\nCuz the underlying cause of this\nis that that printer, well,\n\n286\n00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.150\nthat printer's actually\ngot a paper jam on it.\n\n287\n00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.673\nAnd that's the reason\nwhy it's not printing.\n\n288\n00:15:43.673 --> 00:15:48.143\nBut the fact is, that in terms of incident\nmanagement, incident management's\n\n289\n00:15:48.143 --> 00:15:51.972\njob is to restore normal service\noperations as quickly as possible.\n\n290\n00:15:51.972 --> 00:15:56.463\nAnd so incident management Is\ncompletely dependent on what\n\n291\n00:15:56.463 --> 00:15:59.800\nservice operation is defined as.\n\n292\n00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.660\nThe other thing is that Incident\nManagement's job is to restore normal\n\n293\n00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.760\nservice operations.\n\n294\n00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.680\nSo Justin mentioned efficiency.\n\n295\n00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.300\nWe just want to get to\n\n296\n00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.970\na state of normal service operation\nas quickly as we possibly can.\n\n297\n00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:20.190\nIncident management does not\ncare whether it happens again.\n\n298\n00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:26.570\nSo the fact that that printer's\ngot a printer jam doesn't matter.\n\n299\n00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:27.740\nWe don't care about that.\n\n300\n00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.320\nWe just want to get you up and\nrunning as quickly as possible.\n\n301\n00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.640\nThat's what incident management does,\nrestoring normal service operation.\n\n302\n00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.550\nWe don't care if it happens again.\n\n303\n00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.910\nWe just wanna get things up and running.\n\n304\n00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:44.320\nAnd you don't always wanna find\nout what went wrong either.\n\n305\n00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.380\nThink about this.\n\n306\n00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.370\nYour laptop blue screens.\n\n307\n00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.880\nYou wanna find out what went wrong?\n\n308\n00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.080\nDo you really?\n\n309\n00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.680\nNo.\nNormally what you'll do is,\n\n310\n00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.240\nif your laptop blue screens,\nyou reboot it.\n\n311\n00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.910\nAnd then you reboot it, you get it back\nup and working again, and that's it.\n\n312\n00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:01.400\nYou've had an incident,\nyou've restored normal service operation\n\n313\n00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:06.640\nutilizing what we know as a workaround and\nthat workaround is just to reboot it.\n\n314\n00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.430\nWe haven't bothered to\nfind out what caused it.\n\n315\n00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:10.910\nWhich is that root cause.\n\n316\n00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.280\nWhich is the problem.\n\n317\n00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:16.760\nThe problem is what causes it.\n\n318\n00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.110\nThe incident is the actual\ninterruption to service.\n\n319\n00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:25.580\nAnd incident management's job is\nactually to restore normal service\n\n320\n00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.440\noperation as quickly as possible.\n\n321\n00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.600\nNow hopefully that makes sense.\n\n322\n00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.760\nBut we've not quite finished\nthere with incident management.\n\n323\n00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.210\nYou see, incident management, of course,\n\n324\n00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:45.590\nwe've got targets within our SLA for\nthe response to incidents.\n\n325\n00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.150\nSo maybe we'd have a four hour response.\n\n326\n00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.690\nWell, of course,\nthe customer will call the service desk.\n\n327\n00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.120\nAnd the service desk may be\nin the service integrator or\n\n328\n00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.370\nmay be in another service provider.\n\n329\n00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.220\nBut then, of course,\n\n330\n00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:01.900\nwe've got the issue that we've\ndiscussed in many previous episodes.\n\n331\n00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.900\nThat if we've got a four-hour response,\n\n332\n00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:08.980\nwe have then got to restore service\noperation within four hours.\n\n333\n00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.240\nAnd that's within four hours in total.\n\n334\n00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.050\nThat's not within four hours for service\nprovider one, and then another four hours\n\n335\n00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:19.480\nfor service provider two, and another\nfour hours for service provider three.\n\n336\n00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.710\nNo, that's four hours in total.\n\n337\n00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:26.900\nSo whatever happens, once that incident\nhas been reported to the service desk, we\n\n338\n00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:33.920\nhave got whatever the time scale is that\nis defined in the SLA to restore service.\n\n339\n00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.530\nThis is not about fixing the problem.\n\n340\n00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.310\nThis is about restoring service.\n\n341\n00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:45.020\nAnd by the way,\nyou need quite a diverse range of skills\n\n342\n00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.440\nto perform both incidence management and\nproblem management.\n\n343\n00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.640\nAnd so we keep them separate,\nbecause we don't use the same skills.\n\n344\n00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.370\nThe skills on the service desk,\n\n345\n00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.840\nthe skills that are required to\nrestore normal service operation\n\n346\n00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.490\nare not the same skills that are required\nto find out what went wrong.\n\n347\n00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.190\nFinding out what went wrong\nis a lot more in depth and\n\n348\n00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:10.260\nis going to take a lot more time and\nthat's problem management,\n\n349\n00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.920\nwhereas incident management is\ninterested in the work arounds.\n\n350\n00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.010\nIt's interested in restoring\nnormal service operation.\n\n351\n00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:20.530\nLet me give you a quick example.\n\n352\n00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:21.930\nA very, very quick example.\n\n353\n00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.240\nBut I don't know where this is gonna go.\n\n354\n00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.210\nI'll warn you now.\n\n355\n00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.540\nSo let's just say I went outside\ninto the road outside and\n\n356\n00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.940\nI tripped over a pothole and broke my leg.\n\n357\n00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.270\nWhat's the incident?\n\n358\n00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.680\n&gt;&gt; You broke your leg.\n\n359\n00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:39.470\nRight.\n\n360\n00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:43.220\nBut the incident is the break so\nwhat is the incident?\n\n361\n00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.250\nIt's the failure.\n\n362\n00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.160\n&gt;&gt; The failure of your bone or\nthe failure?\n\n363\n00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:48.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n364\n00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.120\nIt's the broken leg.\n\n365\n00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.350\nThat's the incident.\n\n366\n00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.850\nRight?\n\n367\n00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:53.870\nWhat is the problem?\n\n368\n00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.580\n&gt;&gt; The problem is the hole in the road.\n\n369\n00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.390\n&gt;&gt; Right, the problem is the pothole.\n\n370\n00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:06.730\nWho would I get to come out and\nrestore my service operation?\n\n371\n00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:10.360\n&gt;&gt; That would be EMTs and/or\nsome other medical professional.\n\n372\n00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.000\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo that would be an ambulance then, yeah?\n\n373\n00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.120\nOkay.\n\n374\n00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.070\nWho would I get to come and\nfix the problem?\n\n375\n00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.820\n&gt;&gt; Highway maintenance crew.\n\n376\n00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.320\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n377\n00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:26.030\nTwo completely different set of people,\ntwo completely different set of skills.\n\n378\n00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:32.400\nOne fixes the incident, well not fixes\nthe incident, gets me walking again.\n\n379\n00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.370\nYeah?\nThat was my normal service operation.\n\n380\n00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:38.510\nSo the ambulance guys, the paramedics,\n\n381\n00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.860\nthey'll come out,\nthey'll give me some crutches.\n\n382\n00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:47.768\nWhereas the highway people, they'll\ncome out and they'll fix the problem.\n\n383\n00:20:47.768 --> 00:20:50.591\nYou see if they don't fix the problem, and\n\n384\n00:20:50.591 --> 00:20:54.362\nthis is where the definition\nof a problem's important.\n\n385\n00:20:54.362 --> 00:20:58.290\nIf they don't fix the problem, then that\nproblem will cause another incident.\n\n386\n00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.400\nIt will cause somebody\nelse to break their leg.\n\n387\n00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.040\nAnd somebody else and somebody else.\n\n388\n00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.430\nAnd with each time that happens,\nthen the paramedics need to come out and\n\n389\n00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.970\nneed to provide crutches and\nget everybody up and walking again.\n\n390\n00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:19.730\nSo you see, until we get to the root\ncause we may suffer multiple incidents.\n\n391\n00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:23.650\nBut incident management is just\ngoing to get people walking again.\n\n392\n00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:30.530\nSo incident management, well,\nwe need the paramedics.\n\n393\n00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:33.150\nProblem management,\nwe need the highways department.\n\n394\n00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:35.140\nAnd you wouldn't get the highways\ndepartment to come and\n\n395\n00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.480\nfix the incident, would you?\n\n396\n00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.250\nAnd you certainly wouldn't get the\nparamedics to come out and fix a pothole.\n\n397\n00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.491\nI see you thinking that Justin I'm gonna\nbe very frightened by this question.\n\n398\n00:21:44.491 --> 00:21:48.270\n&gt;&gt; No, I think you might actually like\nthis question because, this makes sense.\n\n399\n00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:53.160\nSo the incident management team is\nrestoring service, the AMTs in this case.\n\n400\n00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.200\nSo, I'm gonna bandage your leg and\nand put you back to walking.\n\n401\n00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.810\nHowever, I would argue that that is not\nthe same level like you could walk.\n\n402\n00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:04.470\nLet's assume that you walked normally.\n\n403\n00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:05.430\nMaybe you could even run.\n\n404\n00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.990\nIf you break your leg,\nit may get you back walking, but\n\n405\n00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:11.580\nyou don't have the capability of running.\n\n406\n00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.940\nWhat constitutes a restoration of service?\n\n407\n00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:18.870\nWould that be part of our\nparticular agreement?\n\n408\n00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's in our SLA.\n\n409\n00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.540\n&gt;&gt; So in this case you got crutches.\n\n410\n00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.670\nYou have fulfilled.\n\n411\n00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.230\nYou have managed the incident.\n\n412\n00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.490\nYou have restored service.\n\n413\n00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:28.170\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n414\n00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:28.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n415\n00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.240\nIt's whatever is in the SLA.\n\n416\n00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.990\nThe restoration of service\nis completely dependent on\n\n417\n00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.580\nwhat the service is defined in the SLA.\n\n418\n00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:40.800\nAnd this is why when we\ngo back to the beginning,\n\n419\n00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.020\nincident management, it was just\nsimply about getting you your report.\n\n420\n00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:49.910\nBecause all we did was define your report\nas your service, nothing more than that.\n\n421\n00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:53.110\nWe didn't say it was your report\nfrom that printer over there.\n\n422\n00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:56.050\nIt was just simply your report.\n\n423\n00:22:56.050 --> 00:23:01.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Jo, we're gonna get in the\nfantastical here, but if the agreement for\n\n424\n00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:07.150\nrestoration of service was I should be\nable to walk and run, in this case,\n\n425\n00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:12.700\nif you've got crutches, then I would not\nhave a restoration of services, per se.\n\n426\n00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.750\nAnd that's where getting too specific\ncould cause problems, right?\n\n427\n00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.090\n&gt;&gt; Well, I wouldn't say that\ngetting specific causes problems,\n\n428\n00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:25.640\nbecause it really depends on\nwe're kinda getting silly here.\n\n429\n00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:30.590\nBut yes, if your estimation of\nservice is the ability to run,\n\n430\n00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:34.080\nthen giving you crutches, unless\nthey were some sort of super, duper,\n\n431\n00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.740\nbionic man type crutches, then giving you\ncrutches is not going to help you run, no.\n\n432\n00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.700\nSo in that case,\nthen service wouldn't be restored.\n\n433\n00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.850\nBut it depends on what's\ndefined as service.\n\n434\n00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.824\nIf service is defined then as just your\nwalking across that road, then yes,\n\n435\n00:23:50.824 --> 00:23:52.787\ncrutches will restore your service.\n\n436\n00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.690\nYeah, does that make sense?\n\n437\n00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.510\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n438\n00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.470\nI think that's actually\nbrought some clarity to me\n\n439\n00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:02.870\nabout how these all intertwine.\n\n440\n00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:07.540\nBecause originally I was like service is,\nseems like kind of an abstract thing.\n\n441\n00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:11.650\nBut for an incident,\nmy main goal is to restore service\n\n442\n00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:15.850\nthrough the use of workarounds, whatever\nit may be, to get you back up running.\n\n443\n00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:20.550\n&gt;&gt; Right, and the complexity that\nwe have here, in this ecosystem,\n\n444\n00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:25.690\nis the fact that we are trying to\nrestore service across, or using,\n\n445\n00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:30.530\nthe resources of potentially a number\nof different service providers.\n\n446\n00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:36.120\nAnd so, whilst the process of\nincident management remains the same,\n\n447\n00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.850\nwe also have to consider the complexity.\n\n448\n00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:44.275\nBut then of course problem\nmanagement could help us with that.\n\n449\n00:24:44.275 --> 00:24:47.795\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nthat in our next episode.\n\n450\n00:24:47.795 --> 00:24:49.675\n&gt;&gt; Well, you're leaving us hanging Jo.\n\n451\n00:24:49.675 --> 00:24:53.165\nBut these are intertwined, so\nyou should definitely come on back.\n\n452\n00:24:53.165 --> 00:24:54.765\nNot necessarily a part two.\n\n453\n00:24:54.765 --> 00:25:00.672\nI think of it as a corresponding\nepisode that looks at the other side.\n\n454\n00:25:00.672 --> 00:25:02.232\nSo hope to see you there.\n\n455\n00:25:02.232 --> 00:25:04.042\nBut for now, we're going to go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n456\n00:25:04.042 --> 00:25:07.062\nSo signing out for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n457\n00:25:07.062 --> 00:25:08.352\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n458\n00:25:08.352 --> 00:25:10.674\n&gt;&gt; And I'll see you next time.\n\n459\n00:25:10.674 --> 00:25:16.525\n[MUSIC]\n\n460\n00:25:16.525 --> 00:25:19.798\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.010\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.690\nwelcome back to another exciting episode\nof ITProTV, I'm your host Justin Dennison\n\n6\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.181\nand we're coming back at you with kind of\na continuation of intimate management.\n\n7\n00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:25.250\nBut in particular, we're gonna be talking\nabout problem management in this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.012\nThey're intertwined.\n\n9\n00:00:26.012 --> 00:00:26.750\nBut luckily,\n\n10\n00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.817\nwe have someone in the studio that's\ngonna help piece those two pieces apart.\n\n11\n00:00:30.817 --> 00:00:32.750\nThe one, the only, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.810\nHow you doing today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great.\n\n13\n00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.300\nThank you, Justin.\nHow are you?\n\n14\n00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.090\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic and\n\n15\n00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.950\nI think I'm starting to get a little\nbit of a hold on the difference between\n\n16\n00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.030\nan incident, and a problem.\n\n17\n00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.899\nAnd incident management is making sense,\nbut I'm kinda seeing if you're gonna throw\n\n18\n00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.765\nme a curve ball when we start\ntalking about problem management.\n\n19\n00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:51.491\n&gt;&gt; Well, not so much a curve ball, but\n\n20\n00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:54.210\nwe're gonna expand certainly\non problem management.\n\n21\n00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.881\nSo, so far,\nwe've looked in our previous episode.\n\n22\n00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:59.150\nWe've looked at incident management.\n\n23\n00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.017\nAn incident is an interruption to or\nreduction in the quality of a service.\n\n24\n00:01:04.017 --> 00:01:09.101\nSo it's an event that has caused\na reduction in the quality\n\n25\n00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:15.221\nof the service that's maybe a failure and\nit is an event that has well,\n\n26\n00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:20.390\ncause disruption to\nthe services defining the SLA.\n\n27\n00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.071\nSo the importance here,\n\n28\n00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:26.399\nwhat's of paramount importance\nis what's defined in the SLA.\n\n29\n00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.474\nThat's how we do know whether\nservices being interrupted or\n\n30\n00:01:31.474 --> 00:01:35.055\nnot, but a problem is what's caused it and\n\n31\n00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:39.843\na problem can occur whether\nthere's an incident or not.\n\n32\n00:01:39.843 --> 00:01:42.749\nA problem is what causes an incident, but\n\n33\n00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:46.870\na problem doesn't necessarily\ncause an incident.\n\n34\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.230\nLet's go back to that example that\nwe used in a previous episode and\n\n35\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.920\nwe were talking about potholes.\n\n36\n00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.200\nWe were talking about\ngetting the paramedics out.\n\n37\n00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.040\nBut essentially, the pothole was a problem\nand the broken leg was the incident.\n\n38\n00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.460\nWe're okay with that, but\n\n39\n00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.820\nthat problem is going to occur whether\nanybody breaks their legs or not.\n\n40\n00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.640\nSo the problem is still there.\n\n41\n00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.174\nThe problem is the underlying cause\nof one or more incidents, but\n\n42\n00:02:15.174 --> 00:02:18.730\na problem can still be there and\ncan still be fixed.\n\n43\n00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.486\nIt can still be rectified without actually\n\n44\n00:02:23.486 --> 00:02:27.474\ncausing an incident.\n&gt;&gt; Hold on a second and\n\n45\n00:02:27.474 --> 00:02:32.448\nto some extent, this makes sense,\nso where we could either find\n\n46\n00:02:32.448 --> 00:02:37.790\na problem after an incident has\noccurred in order to remedy that.\n\n47\n00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.157\nBut a problem regardless of\nwhether an incident occurred or\n\n48\n00:02:41.157 --> 00:02:45.680\nnot is something that is underlying that\nhas the capacity to cause incidences.\n\n49\n00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.008\nIncidences that we want to fix.\n&gt;&gt; You are not\n\n50\n00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:53.828\nthe first person I've heard call it that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n51\n00:02:53.828 --> 00:02:55.061\n&gt;&gt; It's an incident.\n\n52\n00:02:55.061 --> 00:02:58.370\nIt feels weird kind of off the tongue,\nbut like the pothole.\n\n53\n00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.691\nEven if no one broke their leg, it still\nhas the capacity to cause a leg break.\n\n54\n00:03:02.691 --> 00:03:07.669\nSo we want to be proactive in\naddressing that instead of reactive.\n\n55\n00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:09.070\n&gt;&gt; I love the word.\n\n56\n00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.224\nNo, we're not just talking\nabout instead of reactive.\n\n57\n00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:14.550\nTake a quick look at the purpose\nof problem management.\n\n58\n00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.489\nYou will see that it's split into two.\n\n59\n00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:24.430\nIt's split into both reactive and\nproactive, that second bullet point.\n\n60\n00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.664\nIt's responsible for preventing\nincidents from occurring or recurring.\n\n61\n00:03:29.664 --> 00:03:31.937\nSo problem management,\n\n62\n00:03:31.937 --> 00:03:37.575\none of their jobs is to identify\npotential causes of failure.\n\n63\n00:03:37.575 --> 00:03:40.881\nYou've heard of a SPOF?\n&gt;&gt; A what?\n\n64\n00:03:40.881 --> 00:03:42.680\n&gt;&gt; A SPOF.\n\n65\n00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.959\n&gt;&gt; How do you spell that?\n\n66\n00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.640\n&gt;&gt; S-P-O-F, single point of failure.\n\n67\n00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.256\nWe love acronyms.\n&gt;&gt; For some reason,\n\n68\n00:03:51.256 --> 00:03:53.304\nall I could think of was a loofa sponge.\n\n69\n00:03:53.304 --> 00:03:55.250\nBut that's not a single point of failure.\n\n70\n00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.493\nI gotcha, that's a four letter acronym.\n\n71\n00:03:57.493 --> 00:04:01.005\nI'm only good at three letter acronyms.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n72\n00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:02.574\n&gt;&gt; So a single point of failure\n\n73\n00:04:02.574 --> 00:04:03.467\nthen, a SPOF.\n\n74\n00:04:03.467 --> 00:04:06.910\nWhat problem management split into two.\n\n75\n00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.685\nProblem management's job is to,\nwell, fix problems.\n\n76\n00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:16.640\nBut problem management's job is also to\nprevent incidents from happening as well.\n\n77\n00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.768\nSo problem management is split into tow.\n\n78\n00:04:17.768 --> 00:04:20.800\nIt's the reactive and the proactive.\n\n79\n00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.932\nSo I like to look at\nthe reactive as the why.\n\n80\n00:04:23.932 --> 00:04:26.076\nIf you call up the service desk and\n\n81\n00:04:26.076 --> 00:04:29.760\nremember that example that we\nhad from our last episode?\n\n82\n00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.120\nAnd in that example,\nyou called up the service desk and\n\n83\n00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.868\nbecause your report wasn't coming out\nof that printer that was over there and\n\n84\n00:04:37.868 --> 00:04:40.660\nwe defined your service\nas just that report.\n\n85\n00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.484\nAnd at that point in time, then I just\ndiverted you to another printer somewhere\n\n86\n00:04:45.484 --> 00:04:49.560\nelse and you've got your report and\nservice was restored.\n\n87\n00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.426\nBut we still had a problem.\nNow,\n\n88\n00:04:50.426 --> 00:04:53.160\nthere are two things that could happen.\n\n89\n00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.870\nOne is that you could say to me,\nwhy is this happening?\n\n90\n00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:07.221\nAnd if you said to me why didn't I get\nmy report, then what I should do at that\n\n91\n00:05:07.221 --> 00:05:13.590\npoint in time is raise a problem record\nto find the root cause to find out why.\n\n92\n00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.479\nBut you might not.\n\n93\n00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.913\nYou might have been happy with the fact\nthat you've gotta drive a little way and\n\n94\n00:05:18.913 --> 00:05:21.328\nyou can go and\nget your report that way, but\n\n95\n00:05:21.328 --> 00:05:22.766\ndon't shake your head.\n\n96\n00:05:22.766 --> 00:05:23.551\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I said\n\n97\n00:05:23.551 --> 00:05:24.360\nmight.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n98\n00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.632\n&gt;&gt; So what might happen is that somebody\n\n99\n00:05:26.632 --> 00:05:29.416\nelse might come in and\nthey might come in, and\n\n100\n00:05:29.416 --> 00:05:34.050\nhe might want a report of that printer,\nand he doesn't get his report.\n\n101\n00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.030\nSo he calls up the service desk.\n\n102\n00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.620\nAnd again, they divert him and\nthen Cherokee might come in and\n\n103\n00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.780\nshe might try and print something to\nthat printer and it doesn't work.\n\n104\n00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.893\nBut it gets diverted somewhere else,\nso her incident's closed as well.\n\n105\n00:05:46.893 --> 00:05:50.874\nAnd then what happens then in\nthat instance is that proactive\n\n106\n00:05:50.874 --> 00:05:52.904\nproblem management kicks in,\n\n107\n00:05:52.904 --> 00:05:58.459\nbecause proactive problem management is\nperforming trend analysis of incidence.\n\n108\n00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:03.218\nAnd proactive problem management will\nlook at all of these incidents and\n\n109\n00:06:03.218 --> 00:06:07.060\ngo, there's something\nsuspicious going on here.\n\n110\n00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.150\nI need to investigate why.\n\n111\n00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.640\nSo the question why can either\nbe proactive or reactive.\n\n112\n00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.535\nYou could ask me why, then I'd\nraise a problem and investigate or\n\n113\n00:06:20.535 --> 00:06:23.390\nI could be doing some trend analysis.\n\n114\n00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:28.023\nI could be doing some monitoring of\nmy own which I should be as proactive\n\n115\n00:06:28.023 --> 00:06:31.792\nproject management and\nthen I should be identifying that\n\n116\n00:06:31.792 --> 00:06:35.810\nthere's been a number of incidents,\nand identifying why.\n\n117\n00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.710\nSo problem management is really about\nnot just identifying the root cause,\n\n118\n00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.400\nbut it's also about preventing\nincidents from happening too.\n\n119\n00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.978\nNow problem management is something\nthat well, it's gonna be quite\n\n120\n00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:56.393\na challenge when we're doing it\nacross multiple service providers.\n\n121\n00:06:56.393 --> 00:06:59.707\nBecause of course,\nthen we have to raise the problem and\n\n122\n00:06:59.707 --> 00:07:04.081\npotentially pass that problem across\nmultiple service providers to find\n\n123\n00:07:04.081 --> 00:07:07.209\nthe root cause you're thinking.\n&gt;&gt; I am thinking.\n\n124\n00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:12.124\nSo when I think of being proactive\nlike I don't know for some and\n\n125\n00:07:12.124 --> 00:07:18.390\nI understand why this wouldn't\nnecessarily work in all capacities.\n\n126\n00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.140\nProactive doesn't mean to me, I'm\nlooking at trends that are occurring and\n\n127\n00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.100\nI'm proactively trying to find a problem.\n\n128\n00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.559\nI would think proactive would be let\nme make sure to prevent any incidences.\n\n129\n00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.050\nIt's hard to explain,\nsecurity, for instance.\n\n130\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.398\nI'm going to proactively\nlike update security\n\n131\n00:07:39.398 --> 00:07:44.181\npatches to prevent issues\nwith like data breaches or\n\n132\n00:07:44.181 --> 00:07:51.799\nwhatever as best I can that wasn't due to\nan incident that was caused necessarily.\n\n133\n00:07:51.799 --> 00:07:55.220\nLike I don't wanna go well, there's been\nthree data breaches in the last week.\n\n134\n00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.727\nI should probably go figure out why.\n\n135\n00:07:57.727 --> 00:08:01.045\nIs that still considered proactive\neven if no incidences have\n\n136\n00:08:01.045 --> 00:08:02.075\noccurred?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n137\n00:08:02.075 --> 00:08:05.160\nit's about identifying\nsingle points of failure.\n\n138\n00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:10.289\nIt's about identifying potential failures\nand identifying potential incidents.\n\n139\n00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:15.228\nAnd if something we think is going\nto cause an incident like we've seen\n\n140\n00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:17.250\nthe pothole out there.\n\n141\n00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.685\nNow nobody has had an incident yet.\n\n142\n00:08:18.685 --> 00:08:22.520\nNobody has broken a leg yet, but we could.\n\n143\n00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.810\nSo what we would do and prior to problem\nmanagement is we would actually put our\n\n144\n00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.055\nhands up and say, hang on a minute.\n\n145\n00:08:29.055 --> 00:08:30.430\nThere is a problem.\n\n146\n00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.519\nI'm going to raise it as a problem and\nI'm going to record it,\n\n147\n00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:40.311\nand then what I'm also going to do is\nI am going to implement a workaround.\n\n148\n00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:42.837\nAnd in that instance,\nI'm gonna get out there and\n\n149\n00:08:42.837 --> 00:08:46.087\nI'm gonna put some cones out to\nmake sure that nobody knows it.\n\n150\n00:08:46.087 --> 00:08:47.211\nNobody falls down that pothole.\n\n151\n00:08:47.211 --> 00:08:52.260\nSo I'm gonna implement a workaround and\nI'm gonna let everybody\n\n152\n00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:58.170\nknow that this is happening whilst\nI work on fixing the problem.\n\n153\n00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.343\nSo problem management identifies potential\npoints of failure and also has that\n\n154\n00:09:02.343 --> 00:09:06.899\nresponsibility for doing something about\nthat potential point of failure, as well.\n\n155\n00:09:06.899 --> 00:09:10.723\nSo it's not just about doing\ntrend analysis of incidents.\n\n156\n00:09:10.723 --> 00:09:11.905\nYes, they do.\n\n157\n00:09:11.905 --> 00:09:15.650\nBut it's also about\nidentifying potential failures.\n\n158\n00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.558\nBecause if it's a potential failure,\n\n159\n00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:22.530\nsomething might fail than\nthe potentiality of that.\n\n160\n00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.273\nWell, there is an incident\nwaiting to happen, isn't there?\n\n161\n00:09:26.273 --> 00:09:28.710\nAnd we wanna prevent\nincidents from happening.\n\n162\n00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.000\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, I have an additional question.\n\n163\n00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.918\nSo if someone asks why.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n164\n00:09:36.918 --> 00:09:38.449\n&gt;&gt; When they call in,\n\n165\n00:09:38.449 --> 00:09:41.611\nwe need to call a, what did you call it?\n\n166\n00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:42.947\nA problem record.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n167\n00:09:42.947 --> 00:09:45.905\n&gt;&gt; So let me go find out what calls this\n\n168\n00:09:45.905 --> 00:09:47.640\nincident.\n\n169\n00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.232\nCool, I'm good with that one.\n\n170\n00:09:49.232 --> 00:09:54.600\nTrend analysis based on\nprevious instances in ends.\n\n171\n00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.140\nMan, that is hard to say incidences.\n\n172\n00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.750\nThat makes sense.\n\n173\n00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:03.460\nSeeing things that could cause problems\nand maybe this is an unattachment of that.\n\n174\n00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:07.920\nLet's talk about data and\nmaking sure we have appropriate backups.\n\n175\n00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.126\nWould this part of problem\nmanagement if I go you know what?\n\n176\n00:10:11.126 --> 00:10:14.618\nThe average failure time for\na hard drive is five years and\n\n177\n00:10:14.618 --> 00:10:18.570\nwe have this large raid array that\nwe do backups, and all these.\n\n178\n00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:25.207\nI want to keep an inventory and since\nit's five years, would I apply that trend\n\n179\n00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:30.147\nto to keep an incident from occurring?\n&gt;&gt; A nd this is where the line gets\n\n180\n00:10:30.147 --> 00:10:31.304\na little bit blurry,\n\n181\n00:10:31.304 --> 00:10:35.690\nbecause problem management is about\nidentifying potential points of failure.\n\n182\n00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:39.461\nAnd if you've got a that's a little\nbit sort of rusty getting on a bit and\n\n183\n00:10:39.461 --> 00:10:42.870\nyou wanna swap out a disc, would that\nbe considered problem management?\n\n184\n00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.700\nOr would that be considered\navailability management?\n\n185\n00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.380\nThe lines are a little bit tenuous there.\n\n186\n00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.216\nThey're a little bit blurred,\nbut it doesn't matter.\n\n187\n00:10:51.216 --> 00:10:55.152\nThe fact is that you've identified it and\nwhether you log it as a problem,\n\n188\n00:10:55.152 --> 00:10:57.130\nbecause it could cause an incident.\n\n189\n00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.147\nSo technically,\n\n190\n00:10:58.147 --> 00:11:03.330\nit's a problem or whether you consider\nthat as part of your availability plan.\n\n191\n00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.440\nIt doesn't matter as long\nas it's considered and\n\n192\n00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.370\nthe short answer to that is\nI don't care how you do it.\n\n193\n00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.844\nHowever, I do care that you do it and\n\n194\n00:11:11.844 --> 00:11:16.059\nI do care that there's some\nconsistency in the way you do it.\n\n195\n00:11:16.059 --> 00:11:20.796\nAnd this is obviously where the challenge\nis, because you've got so many different\n\n196\n00:11:20.796 --> 00:11:25.150\nservice providers that one service\nprovider might record that as a problem.\n\n197\n00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.679\nAnother service provider might include\nthat in their availability plan.\n\n198\n00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:32.170\nSo there has to be some consistency.\n\n199\n00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.268\nThere has to be an agreement.\n\n200\n00:11:34.268 --> 00:11:38.890\nThere has to be that collaboration\nin place between all of your service\n\n201\n00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:43.432\nproviders where you will agree on\nhow you'll go in to approach that to\n\n202\n00:11:43.432 --> 00:11:47.898\nensure that you capture all of that\ninformation and that you capture\n\n203\n00:11:47.898 --> 00:11:52.000\npotential failures before they happen.\n&gt;&gt; And that makes sense.\n\n204\n00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.576\nI don't know, Jo, it kinda scares me.\n&gt;&gt; We don't wanna be\n\n205\n00:11:55.576 --> 00:11:58.288\nrigid.\n&gt;&gt; I think I'm starting to gain clarity\n\n206\n00:11:58.288 --> 00:12:00.500\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't wanna be rigid.\n\n207\n00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.216\nWe're trying to implement\na framework that works.\n\n208\n00:12:03.216 --> 00:12:07.020\nWe are trying to help you\nmanage your services.\n\n209\n00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:11.056\nWe're not trying to impose lots of rules\nand regulations here that say well,\n\n210\n00:12:11.056 --> 00:12:13.240\nyou must manage your services like this.\n\n211\n00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.220\nWe're trying to help you\nmanage your services.\n\n212\n00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.386\nSo this is not about being rigid.\n\n213\n00:12:17.386 --> 00:12:21.290\nThis is just about ensuring\nthat these things are captured.\n\n214\n00:12:24.484 --> 00:12:26.263\n&gt;&gt; Followup question and\n\n215\n00:12:26.263 --> 00:12:31.504\nI've asked this about some other things,\ncuz I'm trying to think\n\n216\n00:12:31.504 --> 00:12:38.070\nabout we have this process for\nmanaging problems or a set of processes.\n\n217\n00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.592\nWhere did these originate from?\n\n218\n00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:44.180\nIs this service integrator level or would\nthis be individual service providers?\n\n219\n00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.138\nOr would this be a combination of the two?\n\n220\n00:12:46.138 --> 00:12:50.498\nAnd I guess the service integrator\nwould make sure that everything is\n\n221\n00:12:50.498 --> 00:12:55.170\nuniformly applied and everybody does\ntheir due diligence, so to speak.\n\n222\n00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.237\nOr [LAUGH] I feel like you're about to\nthrow a collection question back at me.\n\n223\n00:12:58.237 --> 00:12:59.663\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm not, no.\n\n224\n00:12:59.663 --> 00:13:03.300\nWhat we've gotta make sure is that\nwe've got that collaboration.\n\n225\n00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.360\nAnd so problem management itself,\n\n226\n00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:12.277\nthe activities are going to be\nperformed by many service providers.\n\n227\n00:13:12.277 --> 00:13:15.984\nHowever, the service integrator's\ngot a role to ensure that\n\n228\n00:13:15.984 --> 00:13:20.049\nproblem management happens and\nthis is where your challenges are,\n\n229\n00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:24.275\nis that different service providers\nare gonna have different tools.\n\n230\n00:13:24.275 --> 00:13:27.991\nAnd therefore, potentially you could\nhave a problem logged in this tool with\n\n231\n00:13:27.991 --> 00:13:29.550\nthis service provider.\n\n232\n00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:33.454\nAnd we don't want duplication in this\ntour with this service provider,\n\n233\n00:13:33.454 --> 00:13:37.686\nbut we want to make sure that they're\naware of the fact that there is a problem.\n\n234\n00:13:37.686 --> 00:13:42.075\nSo this is where the service\nintegrator layer really has to manage,\n\n235\n00:13:42.075 --> 00:13:48.020\nbecause they have to have that, what was\nit that you called that 10,000-foot view.\n\n236\n00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.229\nThey have to have a view of everything.\n\n237\n00:13:50.229 --> 00:13:53.959\nEverything that's going on, which is\nwhy collaboration is so important.\n\n238\n00:13:53.959 --> 00:13:57.977\nWe're depending on collaboration\nacross the suppliers, but\n\n239\n00:13:57.977 --> 00:14:03.512\nalso we're dependent on the communication\nchannel between the service providers and\n\n240\n00:14:03.512 --> 00:14:10.912\nthat service integrator layer.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n241\n00:14:10.912 --> 00:14:13.663\n&gt;&gt; I feel like every time in any of these\n\n242\n00:14:13.663 --> 00:14:17.531\nepisodes, there's a steam\ncoming down my ears.\n\n243\n00:14:17.531 --> 00:14:19.841\nBecause there's a lot to consider.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n244\n00:14:19.841 --> 00:14:22.010\n&gt;&gt; These are not easy questions to answer\n\n245\n00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:26.626\nand I think if we lull ourselves into\na false sense of security saying.\n\n246\n00:14:26.626 --> 00:14:31.743\nWell, obviously, you just do this, then\nwe're probably not going to deliver or\n\n247\n00:14:31.743 --> 00:14:36.371\nbe able to consistently deliver.\n&gt;&gt; And it's not just about the tools that\n\n248\n00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:39.991\nwe use, it's also about\nthe consistency in our data and\n\n249\n00:14:39.991 --> 00:14:43.235\nthings like, for instance,\nour asset numbers.\n\n250\n00:14:43.235 --> 00:14:48.110\nThe asset number of one laptop might\nbe different for somebody else.\n\n251\n00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:51.235\nAnd so what I mean we might call it,\nwell, let's go back to the read array.\n\n252\n00:14:51.235 --> 00:14:55.123\nOne of the disks in the read array\nwe might know it by it's, well,\n\n253\n00:14:55.123 --> 00:14:57.750\nby an asset number that we've given it.\n\n254\n00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:01.639\nBut the manufacture, in other words,\nyour service provider might know it\n\n255\n00:15:01.639 --> 00:15:05.787\nby a model number and another service\nprovided my know it by a different number.\n\n256\n00:15:05.787 --> 00:15:08.590\nThey might know it by\nthe serial number for instance.\n\n257\n00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.883\nSo what do you use?\n\n258\n00:15:10.883 --> 00:15:13.620\nYou've got to have standards in your data.\n\n259\n00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.180\nYou've got to walk out before\nwe signed any contracts.\n\n260\n00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.120\nWe've got to look at how\nthis is going to work.\n\n261\n00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:25.624\nHow was this collaboration on\nthe consistency going to be\n\n262\n00:15:25.624 --> 00:15:29.928\nput into place across all of our supplies.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n263\n00:15:29.928 --> 00:15:35.010\nmuch to consider, Jo, but that begs\nquestion have we done a deep enough\n\n264\n00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:40.433\ndive inside of problem management and\nwe're ready to move on or are there any\n\n265\n00:15:40.433 --> 00:15:44.025\nother issues that we need to think about?\n&gt;&gt; We have and\n\n266\n00:15:44.025 --> 00:15:47.310\nwe have to bare in mind that\nwe're on new foundation level.\n\n267\n00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:52.460\nAnd so yes, we've done a deep enough dive\ninto incident and problem management.\n\n268\n00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.686\nThe thing that you have to remember is\nthat even though incident and problem\n\n269\n00:15:56.686 --> 00:16:01.470\nmanagement have two separate areas of\nresponsibility, you can't separate them.\n\n270\n00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:04.690\nBecause you can't have\nan incident without a problem.\n\n271\n00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.336\nA problem is what causes the incident.\n\n272\n00:16:07.336 --> 00:16:10.120\nBut for our foundation level, yes.\n\n273\n00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.045\nWe have to and\nI could talk for days on this.\n\n274\n00:16:12.045 --> 00:16:15.678\nBut no, we've done enough for this level.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jo,\n\n275\n00:16:15.678 --> 00:16:18.120\nI'm kind of interested where\nare we going from here.\n\n276\n00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.931\nWhat's our next step so\nduring our kind of look into the sign-in\n\n277\n00:16:21.931 --> 00:16:23.034\nprocesses.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n278\n00:16:23.034 --> 00:16:25.381\nwe're going to be looking\nat project management and\n\n279\n00:16:25.381 --> 00:16:28.861\nwe're gonna be looking at configuration\nmanagement in our next episode so.\n\n280\n00:16:28.861 --> 00:16:32.781\nBe sure to join us.\n&gt;&gt; Project management probably something\n\n281\n00:16:32.781 --> 00:16:36.200\nI'm not well-versed in, but\nconfiguration management.\n\n282\n00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.177\nIf it means the same thing that I think\nit means, then I'm a little giddy.\n\n283\n00:16:39.177 --> 00:16:43.098\nSo definitely join us back and\nsee what we get into in the next episode.\n\n284\n00:16:43.098 --> 00:16:44.995\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n285\n00:16:44.995 --> 00:16:46.483\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\n\n286\n00:16:46.483 --> 00:16:48.825\nI'm your host Justin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n287\n00:16:48.825 --> 00:16:50.160\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n288\n00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.665\n[MUSIC]\n\n289\n00:16:53.665 --> 00:17:00.434\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

ITPRO.TV\n\n3\n00:00:11.728 --> 00:00:12.919\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone,\n\n4\n00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.020\nand welcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.220\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and\n\n6\n00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.400\nwe're coming back at you with more\nSIAM Foundation and well, we're gonna be\n\n7\n00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.910\nlooking at service level management and\nsupplier management in this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.622\nAnd here to help us along\nis Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:26.622 --> 00:00:28.760\nHow you doing today Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great.\n\n10\n00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.420\nThank you, Justin.\n\n11\n00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.720\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic,\n\n12\n00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.900\nand I will tell you I am definitely out\nof my wheelhouse on these two topics.\n\n13\n00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.500\nSo [LAUGH] I feel like we're about\nto have a little bit of fun.\n\n14\n00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.800\nService level management,\nis that typically abbreviated as SLM?\n\n15\n00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.620\n&gt;&gt; It is, yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.180\nI mean, apart from the fact that you can\nnever write it out in full because it\n\n17\n00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.141\ntakes too long.\n\n18\n00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:53.313\n[LAUGH] But other than that, service level\nmanagement is one of the most sort of\n\n19\n00:00:53.313 --> 00:00:56.152\ncommonly abbreviated\nprocesses in the whole of IT.\n\n20\n00:00:56.152 --> 00:01:01.350\nAnd we put service level management and\nsupplier management together,\n\n21\n00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.207\npurely because they're pretty much\ndoing exactly the same thing,\n\n22\n00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:09.020\nespecially in a SIAM Ecosystem.\n\n23\n00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.520\nSo service level management is about,\n\n24\n00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.340\nif we take a look at the purpose of\nservice level management, it's about\n\n25\n00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.150\nensuring that the performance of\nthe service meets the agreed requirements.\n\n26\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.240\nAnd these requirements are set\nout to a service level target.\n\n27\n00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.390\nSo the first thing that\nI wanted to cover is,\n\n28\n00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.530\nit mentions the word contract there and\nwe've already had an episode.\n\n29\n00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.830\nIf you've been following the episodes\nthrough in chronological order,\n\n30\n00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.900\nthen you'll see that we've\nalready had an episode where\n\n31\n00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.010\nwe talked about contract management.\n\n32\n00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.790\nAnd contract management is specifically\nabout managing the nuances\n\n33\n00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.670\nof the contract.\n\n34\n00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.410\nIt's about all of the legal stuff.\n\n35\n00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.860\nSupply management,\n\n36\n00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.320\non the other hand, well, it's tied\nin with service level management.\n\n37\n00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.360\nAnd they're pretty much the same process,\nit just depends\n\n38\n00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.680\non whether we're talking about internal or\nexternal providers, and whether we're\n\n39\n00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.560\ntalking about the agreement with\nthe service integrator and the customer.\n\n40\n00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.470\nNow that I've completely lost you because\nI can see the look on Justin's face.\n\n41\n00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.011\nRight?\n[LAUGH] Straight away.\n\n42\n00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:18.200\n[LAUGH] Yup, that was it\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n43\n00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.557\n&gt;&gt; Let's go into this a little bit more in\n\n44\n00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:21.250\ndepth.\n\n45\n00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.020\nThe purpose said that it ensures\nthat service performance meets or\n\n46\n00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.460\nexceeds the agreed requirements.\n\n47\n00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.870\nAnd I add in those words or\n\n48\n00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.830\nexceeds because that's what we're\naiming to do, is we're aiming to exceed\n\n49\n00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.360\nthe service level targets that\nare required by the organization.\n\n50\n00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.960\nSo I'm gonna go back\nright to the very start.\n\n51\n00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.720\nAnd right to the very start of any\ngiven service we, the customer,\n\n52\n00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.590\nsets out the definition or\ntheir requirements.\n\n53\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.270\nWe call them service level requirements.\n\n54\n00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.339\nAnd the service level requirements\nare the requirements of that service.\n\n55\n00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.090\nSo ordinarily, the customer would\nsay to the service integrator,\n\n56\n00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.550\nI want the ability to send and\nto see the email.\n\n57\n00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.620\nSo now I'm gonna involve Justin.\n\n58\n00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.480\nWhat's wrong with that statement?\n&gt;&gt; Seems like there's kind of a load of\n\n59\n00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.370\nI want to send and receive email.\n\n60\n00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.050\nIt doesn't seem specific enough.\n\n61\n00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.870\nWhat times do you want send and\nreceive email?\n\n62\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.310\nWhat are the guarantees?\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, wait a minute, let me back up.\n\n63\n00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.374\nI used her bad word.\n\n64\n00:03:35.374 --> 00:03:40.206\nWhat are the expectations?\n\n65\n00:03:40.206 --> 00:03:45.496\nI know we've talked about timing before,\nmaking sure we know about maintenance\n\n66\n00:03:45.496 --> 00:03:49.419\nperiods and things of that nature.\n&gt;&gt; When we've looked at things like\n\n67\n00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.509\nincident management and\nwe've looked at problem management and\n\n68\n00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:56.280\nwe've understood that the service\ndescription is so important.\n\n69\n00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.920\nHow do you know if you've had\nan incident to your service,\n\n70\n00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.140\nan interruption to your service,\nif you don't know what your service is?\n\n71\n00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.210\nAnd the example that we used when we\ntalked about incident management,\n\n72\n00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.520\nif you take a look at that episode,\nwas the example of a printer.\n\n73\n00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.190\nAnd if you remember, is my service that\nprinter, well, is it just that report,\n\n74\n00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.220\nor is my service that report from\nthat printer over there specifically.\n\n75\n00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.480\nWhat's in the SLA is incredibly important.\n\n76\n00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.380\nHow we start off when we\nare defining a new service,\n\n77\n00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.860\nwhen the customer comes to us and says, we\nwant to ability to send and receive email.\n\n78\n00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.090\nThat's what they're starting off with.\n\n79\n00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.150\nAnd Justin used the word ambiguous.\n\n80\n00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.610\nIt's not particularly specific.\n\n81\n00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.110\nBut invariably,\nthe customer doesn't know what they want.\n\n82\n00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.900\nInvariably, the customer will come to us\nand say I want the ability to send and\n\n83\n00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.070\nreceive email without actually\nunderstanding the requirements.\n\n84\n00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.420\nSo the first thing the service level\nmanagement has got to do as a process,\n\n85\n00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.466\nis sit down and\nactually add in service-level targets.\n\n86\n00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:04.550\nAnd those service-level targets\nwill add in the specifics.\n\n87\n00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.970\nSo things like, I want the ability to\nsend and receive email 24 hours a day.\n\n88\n00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.290\nI want my email to, once I press send,\nto actually disappear and\n\n89\n00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.990\nbe sent within a minute,\nor within 30 seconds.\n\n90\n00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.580\nOr, and\nI want the ability to have 5,000 licenses.\n\n91\n00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.260\nSo service level management\nmost of all works out.\n\n92\n00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.660\nIt takes the statement of requirements\nfrom business relationship management,\n\n93\n00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.980\nfrom the customer, and\n\n94\n00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.260\nthen works out exactly what our\nservice level targets would be.\n\n95\n00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.970\nI use the word targets,\n\n96\n00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.830\nremember Justin used the word guarantee.\n&gt;&gt; I've backed up just so we're clear,\n\n97\n00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.030\nI've backed up and I said expectations\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n98\n00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.772\n&gt;&gt; And I think I know where you're going\n\n99\n00:05:54.772 --> 00:05:55.960\nwith this right?\n\n100\n00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.550\nIt's kinda one of those things\nwhere I say guarantees and\n\n101\n00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.630\nmy guarantee isn't quite as concrete.\n\n102\n00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.680\nBut targets, I guess,\nare what we're striving for, but\n\n103\n00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.780\nthere could be some variability in that.\n\n104\n00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.750\nAnd that's kind of assumed,\nor not necessarily assumed,\n\n105\n00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.410\nbut maybe even made explicit.\n&gt;&gt; Right, they've gotta be made explicit.\n\n106\n00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.280\nWe can't assume anything, and\nwe've gotta have everything written down.\n\n107\n00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:29.050\nBut it's not just as simple as gathering\nthe requirements and writing them down.\n\n108\n00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.550\nBecause what has to happen, and\n\n109\n00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:37.120\nthis is where it gets complicated\nespecially in the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n110\n00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.500\nIs we first of all,\nwe've got three layers.\n\n111\n00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.830\nIf you remember these three layers, we've\ngot our customer layer, we've got our\n\n112\n00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.310\nservice integrator layer, and then\nwe've got our service provider layers.\n\n113\n00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.220\nAnd those service providers could\nbe either internal or external.\n\n114\n00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.930\nSo when we talk about internal service\nproviders, we talk about agreements.\n\n115\n00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.230\nAnd when we talk about\nexternal service providers,\n\n116\n00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.620\nwe talk about contracts which is\nwhere supply management comes in.\n\n117\n00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.970\nSo what we're doing right\nnow is we're agreeing\n\n118\n00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.000\nbetween the service integrator and\nthe customer.\n\n119\n00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.140\nWe're agreeing what the customer will see.\n\n120\n00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.140\nWe've not gone down to\nthis lower layer yet.\n\n121\n00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.760\nWe're agreeing what the customer will see.\n\n122\n00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.350\nSo here we're talking about the targets\nthat the customer wants to achieve.\n\n123\n00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.709\nAnd they've got to be incredibly specific\nbecause you see, we can't start to,\n\n124\n00:07:29.709 --> 00:07:33.828\nif the customer is here, and our layer\nhere is with the service integrated.\n\n125\n00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:36.689\nWe can't start to negotiate these targets\n\n126\n00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:40.909\nuntil we understand what these\ntargets are going to look like.\n\n127\n00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:47.039\nSo the customer tells us that they\nwant the ability to send an email\n\n128\n00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:48.404\n24 hours a day.\n\n129\n00:07:48.404 --> 00:07:53.257\nSo now, the service integrator,\nservice level management, and\n\n130\n00:07:53.257 --> 00:07:58.718\nsupply management as well, has now\ngot to work out There's the customer,\n\n131\n00:07:58.718 --> 00:08:01.337\nthere's our service integrator.\n\n132\n00:08:01.337 --> 00:08:05.871\nThey have now got to work out\nwhat exactly is required in\n\n133\n00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:09.430\norder to be able to send and\nreceive email.\n\n134\n00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:16.520\nAnd more explicitly, what is required\nfrom each individual service provider.\n\n135\n00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.930\nAnd how are they going to work together.\n\n136\n00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.880\nSo service level management will manage\nthat layer between the service integrator\n\n137\n00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.760\nand the customer.\n\n138\n00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.260\nBut they also have to take\nan accountability for\n\n139\n00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.890\nidentifying requirements for\nsupply management.\n\n140\n00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:41.010\nAnd for any other service level agreements\nor OLAs, operational level agreements,\n\n141\n00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.760\nthat exist within each service\nprovider that's internal.\n\n142\n00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.320\nWhen we think about this, and\n\n143\n00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.010\nthis is why I said this is\nwhere we add in the complexity.\n\n144\n00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.090\nSo we'll also have targets between the\nservice integrator and the customer that\n\n145\n00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:01.510\nsays when I have an incident, I want to\nreport this incident to the service desk.\n\n146\n00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.430\nAnd I want a response within four hours.\n\n147\n00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.330\nSo it's at this point in time, that, and\n\n148\n00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.910\nwe're only just designing\nthe service right now.\n\n149\n00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.870\nIt's at this point in time, where I'm\nexpecting the service integrator to start\n\n150\n00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.760\nthe negotiations with all\nof the service providers.\n\n151\n00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.120\nBecause we cannot commit.\n\n152\n00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.525\nI'm not using the word guarantee.\n\n153\n00:09:24.525 --> 00:09:28.430\n[LAUGH] We cannot commit\nto a four-hour response.\n\n154\n00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.960\nWe can't commit to 24-hour\nemail availability\n\n155\n00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.710\nif we don't know what all of our\nservice providers can commit to.\n\n156\n00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:42.260\nI have seen way too many issues with\nservice integrators and with customers.\n\n157\n00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.018\nWhere the customer would come and\n\n158\n00:09:44.018 --> 00:09:47.784\nall they want is something simple as\nfar as the customer is concerned and\n\n159\n00:09:47.784 --> 00:09:51.070\nit needs to be kept simple as far\nas the customer is concerned.\n\n160\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:55.558\nAnd what the customer wants is they wanna\ncome to you as a service integrator along\n\n161\n00:09:55.558 --> 00:09:58.710\nthe availability to send\nan email 24 hours a day.\n\n162\n00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:03.132\nAnd what happens underneath that\nthe customer is not interested in.\n\n163\n00:10:03.132 --> 00:10:08.349\nBut if you've just got one\nservice provider that cannot\n\n164\n00:10:08.349 --> 00:10:14.454\ncommit to a 24 hour service delivery,\nthen, your 24 hours,\n\n165\n00:10:14.454 --> 00:10:19.230\nat that customer layer,\nis gonna be jeopardized.\n\n166\n00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.755\nSo what would you do in that instance?\n&gt;&gt; That's tricky.\n\n167\n00:10:25.755 --> 00:10:27.500\nUnless you really have two paths.\n\n168\n00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.730\nYou would either find a replacement.\n\n169\n00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:34.000\nYou're only the strongest or\nweakest link, however cliché that is.\n\n170\n00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.570\nOr you were to return to the customer and\nmake that known.\n\n171\n00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:42.210\nAnd maybe have a discussion\nabout the 24 hour expectation.\n\n172\n00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.080\nBut I guess that depends on\nultimately on your working\n\n173\n00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.200\nrelationship with that customer.\n&gt;&gt; Right, you're right, and\n\n174\n00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.740\nduring the design of the service itself.\n\n175\n00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.540\nAnd so we talk about design.\n\n176\n00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.890\nWe don't just talk about building.\n\n177\n00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.470\nWe've got to design it first, and\nduring the design of the service itself,\n\n178\n00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:03.780\nwe've gotta design it so that it\ncan meet the needs of the customer.\n\n179\n00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.700\nThose agreed targets the customer.\n\n180\n00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:12.502\nAnd as Justin has said, if we find that\none service provider can't meet those\n\n181\n00:11:12.502 --> 00:11:19.270\nneeds, or maybe there's a cost\nimplication even of meeting those needs,\n\n182\n00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:26.540\nthen it's during the design when we\nwill negotiate with the customer.\n\n183\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.390\nAnd it's perfectly feasible for\nus to go back to the customer.\n\n184\n00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.010\nThis is what service\nlevel management will do.\n\n185\n00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.470\nWorking with supply management,\ngo back to the customer and\n\n186\n00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.340\nsay to the customer, you know what?\n\n187\n00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:42.070\nThis 24 hours a day, I've got one\nsupplier that can't make that,\n\n188\n00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.380\nbecause they do backups.\n\n189\n00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:48.540\nThey do urgent maintenance between\nthe hours of 1:00 AM and 2:00 AM.\n\n190\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.590\nSo can we make it 23 hours a day?\n\n191\n00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:57.310\nOr maybe service level manager have to go\nback to the customer and has got to say,\n\n192\n00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.810\nwell, we can do 24 hours a day.\n\n193\n00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:06.020\nBut the cost of doing 24 hours a day\nis gonna be 10 millions pounds a month.\n\n194\n00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:12.900\nSo if we reduce it to 23 hours a day it\ntakes it down to literally 1 million so\n\n195\n00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.200\nhow does that sound?\n\n196\n00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.190\nBecause we can reduce that cost by\na tenth if you lower your expectations.\n\n197\n00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.952\nAnd there may be business\nreasons why they can't.\n\n198\n00:12:20.952 --> 00:12:27.800\nBut during this period we have\nwhat we call negotiations.\n\n199\n00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.450\nAnd we will negotiate not\nonly with our customer, but\n\n200\n00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:36.520\nwe then also negotiate with our suppliers\nand our service providers as well.\n\n201\n00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.750\nAnd so the design, and then also\nthe subsequent build, and test, and\n\n202\n00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:48.680\ndeployment, during the design that's when\nwe negotiate those service level targets.\n\n203\n00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:54.730\nAnd it's the agreement of those service\nlevel targets that actually then\n\n204\n00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.850\ndictates what the level\nof service will be.\n\n205\n00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:05.465\nSo service level management not only\nagrees the service description.\n\n206\n00:13:05.465 --> 00:13:09.255\nService level management should also\nbe agreeing the targets with which\n\n207\n00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:11.155\nvarious processes are performed.\n\n208\n00:13:11.155 --> 00:13:15.285\nIncluding things like incident\nmanagement and change management.\n\n209\n00:13:15.285 --> 00:13:18.715\nThe request fulfillment, for instance.\n\n210\n00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:22.405\nAll of those processes should\nhave targets in the SLA.\n\n211\n00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.680\nWe should also have other\ntargets as well in the SLA.\n\n212\n00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:31.820\nWell, we know about availability targets,\nbut what about service continuity?\n\n213\n00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.970\nWhat about disaster recovery?\n\n214\n00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:38.240\nDisaster recovery is part of\nservice continuity, do you know\n\n215\n00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:43.340\nwhat the difference is between the two?\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go with, no.\n\n216\n00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.010\nOr let's assume that I do but\nno one else does.\n\n217\n00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:50.830\nSo definitely give us a review.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I'll take that as a no then,\n\n218\n00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.050\nright?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n219\n00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.670\n&gt;&gt; Service continuity is about having\n\n220\n00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.680\nthe resilience options.\n\n221\n00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:59.760\nIt's about keeping the service running no\nmatter what happens, that's continuity.\n\n222\n00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.360\nDisaster recovery is\nallowing it to fail and\n\n223\n00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.030\nthen picking up the pieces\nonce it has failed.\n\n224\n00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:09.730\nSo when we talk about service continuity\nwe're talking about redundant systems.\n\n225\n00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.632\nOr we're talking about mirrored service.\n\n226\n00:14:11.632 --> 00:14:16.912\nOr we're talking about maybe dual\ndata centers that run in parallel and\n\n227\n00:14:16.912 --> 00:14:20.608\nthen when one fails the other\nsimply takes over and\n\n228\n00:14:20.608 --> 00:14:24.570\nthere is no impact to\nthe business whatsoever.\n\n229\n00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.820\nSo that's what we would\ncall service continuity.\n\n230\n00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:33.040\nDisaster recovery is when one fails then\nyes, we actually flick a switch over\n\n231\n00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.620\nto the other one and then we have to bring\nthe services up in the other data center.\n\n232\n00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.320\nThat's disaster recovery,\nit's about recovering after a disaster.\n\n233\n00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.630\nBoth of these refer to\ndisasters by the way.\n\n234\n00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:49.490\nService continuity is continuity\nin the case of a disaster.\n\n235\n00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.580\nBut we're talking about mirroring,\nwe're talking about redundant systems.\n\n236\n00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:57.530\nWhereas disaster recovery is about how\ndo we pick up the pieces afterwards.\n\n237\n00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:02.050\nBy the way, now that I mentioned disaster\nrecovery and service continuity, we also\n\n238\n00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:08.010\nhave to consider what we will need to do\nto get back to business as usual as well.\n\n239\n00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:12.263\nThat has to be part of any negotiations.\n\n240\n00:15:12.263 --> 00:15:16.925\nSo all that needs to be in your service\nlegal agreement too, because in your\n\n241\n00:15:16.925 --> 00:15:21.916\nservice agreement you gonna define all\nyour targets for the business as usual.\n\n242\n00:15:21.916 --> 00:15:26.330\nAnd unfortunately business as usual\ncan sometimes involve a disaster,\n\n243\n00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.700\nwe don't like to think about that but\nit does.\n\n244\n00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:33.970\nAnd that involves money as well,\nfor a lot of organizations.\n\n245\n00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:37.350\nIt will certainly involve\ndifferent targets.\n\n246\n00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:44.578\nI do not expect our availability to be\nnecessarily the same during a disaster.\n\n247\n00:15:44.578 --> 00:15:49.395\nBut I certainly don't expect our incident\nmanagement to request management\n\n248\n00:15:49.395 --> 00:15:52.517\nprocess targets to be\nthe same during a disaster.\n\n249\n00:15:52.517 --> 00:15:57.719\nBecause quite often during a disaster IT\nare under stress, So is the customer.\n\n250\n00:15:57.719 --> 00:16:02.087\nSo what we're concentrating on is what\nwe call our vital business functions,\n\n251\n00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:02.770\nour VBFs.\n\n252\n00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:06.880\nThose functions that are critical\nto the organization in order for\n\n253\n00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.655\nthe organization to survive.\n\n254\n00:16:09.655 --> 00:16:13.335\nWe'll look a little bit more on that when\nwe look at service portfolio management.\n\n255\n00:16:13.335 --> 00:16:15.850\nWe'll look at prioritizing our services.\n\n256\n00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:20.540\nUltimately IT, the service integrator and\nthat service provider, but\n\n257\n00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.940\nmainly the service integrator\nneeds to understand which of\n\n258\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.390\nour services are the priority services.\n\n259\n00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:33.310\nWhere do we concentrate all of our\nefforts in the case of a disaster?\n\n260\n00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:36.290\nSo that needs to be agreed in\nour service level agreement.\n\n261\n00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.950\nThis is not something that IT decides for\nthemselves, by the way.\n\n262\n00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.200\nThis needs to be agreed in the SLA.\n\n263\n00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.180\nSo the SLA is not a small document.\n\n264\n00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:54.320\nAnd certainly when it comes to the SIAM\necosystem this SLA is crucial.\n\n265\n00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:59.640\nBecause whether your service integrator is\ninternal, or whether it's external It's\n\n266\n00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.780\nsets the parameters in the requirements\nand the expectations of the customer.\n\n267\n00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:11.430\nAnd so all of the targets\nthat under pin the targets in\n\n268\n00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:17.850\ninternal SLAs or LAs and\ncontracts, on depending contracts.\n\n269\n00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:21.555\nAll of those targets have to under\npin the targets in that SLA.\n\n270\n00:17:21.555 --> 00:17:24.640\nThe one between the service integrator and\nthe customer.\n\n271\n00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.980\nSo that's agreeing our\nservice level targets.\n\n272\n00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.760\nWhen do we actually finalize\nour service level targets?\n\n273\n00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:39.225\nWhen do we agree them, do you think?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n274\n00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:43.190\nThat's one of those things where I'm not\nentirely sure where that would occur.\n\n275\n00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.540\nSo we've made these negotiations,\nserviced old targets.\n\n276\n00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.310\nI don't know.\nI don't know Jo.\n\n277\n00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:55.250\nI am at a loss for words on this one.\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's think about during\n\n278\n00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:59.610\nthe design we talk about in the design\nthe fact that we've got to Well, we've\n\n279\n00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.950\ngot to negotiate those targets and the\ncomplexity of negotiating those targets.\n\n280\n00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.460\nBut during the build and test and\n\n281\n00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:12.220\nthe deployment as well,\nwe are still negotiating targets.\n\n282\n00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:17.070\nBecause even though we're\nabsolutely fantastic in IT, and\n\n283\n00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:21.480\neven though we have picked the best\nsuppliers in the world and\n\n284\n00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.990\nthe best service providers in the world,\nnevertheless.\n\n285\n00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:29.430\nIf we're getting lots of service\nproviders involved in the build and\n\n286\n00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.230\nin the testing,\nthen you dont necessarily know what's\n\n287\n00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.790\ngonna come out of the woodwork\nat that point in time.\n\n288\n00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:38.700\nSo we don't actually agree\nthe service level targets\n\n289\n00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.630\nuntil after early life support.\n\n290\n00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:46.820\nThat's once the service has been\ndeployed into the live environment,\n\n291\n00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:52.120\nand the customer is happy with the level\nof service they are receiving, and that\n\n292\n00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.960\nour service providers are happy with the\nlevel of service they're able to provide.\n\n293\n00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.480\nAnd it's at that point in time\nthat that SLA is then signed.\n\n294\n00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.690\nAnd that's when the customer says,\nyeah I'm happy with this.\n\n295\n00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.580\nThat's only one part of it.\n\n296\n00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.450\nYou're thinking, Justin.\n&gt;&gt; All right, I was just making sure.\n\n297\n00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.232\nRyan and I are like [SOUND] I don't know.\n\n298\n00:19:13.232 --> 00:19:16.517\nSo over the course of the design,\nand the build, and\n\n299\n00:19:16.517 --> 00:19:20.488\nyou're starting to make things,\nwe kind of go back and forth.\n\n300\n00:19:20.488 --> 00:19:25.074\nAnd then we're more or less trying\nto hit the steady state where we go,\n\n301\n00:19:25.074 --> 00:19:28.900\nokay, this is what we can provide,\nthis is what you want.\n\n302\n00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.380\nAnd we've come to some agreement.\n\n303\n00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.296\nIt's kind of counterintuitive to me\nthat it would happen after like the gone\n\n304\n00:19:35.296 --> 00:19:35.915\nlive date.\n\n305\n00:19:35.915 --> 00:19:40.543\nBut you don't really know your steady\nstate until things are live because as you\n\n306\n00:19:40.543 --> 00:19:45.239\nsaid there are a plethora of unforseen\ncircumstances where you go, yeah, and\n\n307\n00:19:45.239 --> 00:19:49.935\nthat could cause things to go down, or\nmaybe we need this maintenance schedule or\n\n308\n00:19:49.935 --> 00:19:52.046\nwhatever it ends up being.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n309\n00:19:52.046 --> 00:19:56.806\nwell you see it's not until we get\nit into the line environment that we\n\n310\n00:19:56.806 --> 00:20:01.750\nactually know how the service is going\nto work in the line environment.\n\n311\n00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:09.480\nI have had so many organizations that have\nsaid to me, I've got this fantastic test\n\n312\n00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:14.810\nenvironment, it's absolutely great, and\nit emulates my live environment exactly.\n\n313\n00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:16.800\nNo it doesn't.\n\n314\n00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:22.490\nThose environments or those\norganizations that will say to me and\n\n315\n00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:27.400\nwe've developed these fantastic programs\nand they can simulate all of the work load\n\n316\n00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:32.790\nin our live environment unfortunately,\nIt can't.\n\n317\n00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.481\nYes, we can get smart with our testing,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n318\n00:20:35.481 --> 00:20:39.456\nAnd we will advise absolutely\nevery single organization, and\n\n319\n00:20:39.456 --> 00:20:42.681\nit's crucially important\nin the Siam ecosystem,\n\n320\n00:20:42.681 --> 00:20:48.420\nwe would advise absolutely every single\norganization to have a test environment.\n\n321\n00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:53.270\nYou're bringing in multiple service\nproviders and they are doing\n\n322\n00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:57.540\ndevelopment work and different aspects\nof the development work, for you.\n\n323\n00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.680\nSo, it's crucial that you\nhave a build environment\n\n324\n00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.320\nthat all of these service\nproviders can get access to.\n\n325\n00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.840\nAnd that you have a test environment\nthat all of these service providers\n\n326\n00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.700\nhave access to.\n\n327\n00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.250\nSo that they can text.\n\n328\n00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:16.797\nBut unfortunately within the Siam\necosystem because you're bringing\n\n329\n00:21:16.797 --> 00:21:22.465\nin lots of service providers and they\ncome from internal and external sources.\n\n330\n00:21:22.465 --> 00:21:27.728\nThen, it's not until we get it into\nthe real live environment that we actually\n\n331\n00:21:27.728 --> 00:21:32.890\nare able to ascertain what's going\nto work and what's not going work?\n\n332\n00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:37.030\nAnd it's at the end of what we call\nour early life support period, or\n\n333\n00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.320\nour handover period.\n\n334\n00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:44.260\nSome people call it, sort of,\ncritical care period, the ITLC period.\n\n335\n00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:49.698\nI don't care what you call it, but\nwe have to have a bedding in period.\n\n336\n00:21:49.698 --> 00:21:54.486\nWhere we're not testing\nat that point in time.\n\n337\n00:21:54.486 --> 00:21:57.260\nWe are allowing it to settle in.\n\n338\n00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.630\nThe testing should be done before\nit goes into the LAN environment.\n\n339\n00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:06.080\nBut nevertheless, we have to allow\nthe service to settle in and to well,\n\n340\n00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.750\nestablish the status quo,\nestablish the business as usual.\n\n341\n00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.900\nAnd then once we do that,\nthat's when we approach the customer and\n\n342\n00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.000\nthen we say to the customer\nwell you know what?\n\n343\n00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.970\nThis is what we're going to\ngive you on a regular basis.\n\n344\n00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:21.930\nWhat do you think?\n\n345\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:22.990\nIs it okay?\n\n346\n00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:24.490\nCan you agree to that?\n\n347\n00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:28.880\nAnd that's when we sign\nthe service level agreement.\n\n348\n00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.160\nNot before then.\n\n349\n00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.750\nBecause until we get it into the live\nenvironment, we really, really don't know.\n\n350\n00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.480\nAnd it may be something really simple.\n\n351\n00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.330\nIt may be that the customer's\ndecided that, you know what?\n\n352\n00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.010\nWe've tried to call the service desk and\n\n353\n00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:46.010\nthe service desk just have too long\na queue or too long a wait time.\n\n354\n00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:50.090\nAnd therefore we need to find another\nway to contact the service desk.\n\n355\n00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.257\nWe still need to be in the position\nwhere we can make changes.\n\n356\n00:22:53.257 --> 00:22:57.897\nBearing in mind that we're talking\nabout the service level going\n\n357\n00:22:57.897 --> 00:23:01.187\nbetween the integrator and\nthe customer, but\n\n358\n00:23:01.187 --> 00:23:06.180\nat this level with our service\nproviders we may be talking contracts.\n\n359\n00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.901\nAnd once the contract\ndesigned then it's very,\n\n360\n00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:14.504\nvery difficult to deviate\nfrom that contract.\n\n361\n00:23:14.504 --> 00:23:17.727\nIt's very difficult to make\nchanges to that contract.\n\n362\n00:23:17.727 --> 00:23:22.266\nAnd this is why supply management\nalso has to get involved and\n\n363\n00:23:22.266 --> 00:23:27.339\nsay right, well, we're going to\ntentatively sign the contract,\n\n364\n00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:32.145\nbut we have to have a period where\nwe can make changes dependent on\n\n365\n00:23:32.145 --> 00:23:38.050\nthe reaction of the service in the live\nenvironment once it goes live.\n\n366\n00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.650\nDependent on things like workload.\n\n367\n00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.518\nDependent on bandwidth utilization.\n\n368\n00:23:43.518 --> 00:23:49.388\nDependent on the utilization of our\ncustomer, bearing in mind as well,\n\n369\n00:23:49.388 --> 00:23:54.874\nwhen we first deploy a new service\nutilization of that new service,\n\n370\n00:23:54.874 --> 00:23:58.257\nwhatever it may be, is not at it's norm.\n\n371\n00:23:58.257 --> 00:24:00.935\nWhat happens is when you\ndeploy a new service,\n\n372\n00:24:00.935 --> 00:24:04.106\nyou will see a peak of\nutilization from your customer.\n\n373\n00:24:04.106 --> 00:24:08.193\nAnd that's because, that's the curiosity\nfactor, and that curiosity factor\n\n374\n00:24:08.193 --> 00:24:11.512\nhas everybody logging in and\neverybody seeing what it's about.\n\n375\n00:24:11.512 --> 00:24:13.701\nBut then immediately following that, and\n\n376\n00:24:13.701 --> 00:24:16.510\nthat curiosity factor can\nlast literally a day or two.\n\n377\n00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:21.430\nAnd then immediately following\nthat you get a deflation,\n\n378\n00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:24.720\nyou get a trough in utilization.\n\n379\n00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.807\nWhere your customer goes through what we\ncall the emotional cycle of change, and\n\n380\n00:24:28.807 --> 00:24:33.610\nwhere your customer looks at it and says,\nyeah, I don't wanna be dealing with that.\n\n381\n00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:36.230\nYeah, let's leave that.\n\n382\n00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:40.090\nAnd so for the first couple of weeks\nyou're going to get a huge fluctuation\n\n383\n00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:41.460\nin usage.\n\n384\n00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:46.360\nAnd so it's not until that\nhas started to even out.\n\n385\n00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.500\nThat's when we look to sign\nour service level Agreements.\n\n386\n00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.930\nWe don't want to sign before\nthat early life support period.\n\n387\n00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:59.100\nBecause we want to ensure that we've\nreached our sort of optimum performance.\n\n388\n00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:03.180\nAnd it's at that point in time when we\nensure that we get everything else signed.\n\n389\n00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.942\nDoes that makes sense?\n&gt;&gt; That does make sense.\n\n390\n00:25:05.942 --> 00:25:10.395\nAnd this may, as I said, originally I\nwas like, that's counterintuitive, but\n\n391\n00:25:10.395 --> 00:25:14.020\nthe more I think about it,\nas you said, we kinda get this wiggle.\n\n392\n00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:18.170\nBut it's going to dampen out and lead to\nthis, what I would call a steady state.\n\n393\n00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:21.010\nWhere you're like,\nI'm gonna know about utilization,\n\n394\n00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:23.870\nI'm gonna know about usage\nin a more accurate manner,\n\n395\n00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.440\ninstead of trying to figure out\nwhere all this noise is coming from.\n\n396\n00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.366\nWhere people are like, this is amazing.\n\n397\n00:25:28.366 --> 00:25:29.380\nThis is hard.\n\n398\n00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.610\nThis is cool again.\n\n399\n00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.830\nThis is all right, I guess.\n\n400\n00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:35.710\nBut, I do want to clarify something, Jo.\n\n401\n00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:37.740\nWe are doing this in a live environment,\nbut\n\n402\n00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:41.750\nwe're not advocating that you do not\ndo any type of test environment.\n\n403\n00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.040\nEven though we're gonna have differences.\n\n404\n00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.920\nWe're just making sure.\n&gt;&gt; We are not talking about testing.\n\n405\n00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.040\nThis has got nothing to do with testing.\n\n406\n00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.790\nTesting has to happen\nin a test environment.\n\n407\n00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:57.820\nBut what I'm saying to you is that we\ndon't know the service is going to perform\n\n408\n00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.907\nuntil we get it in the live environment.\n\n409\n00:25:59.907 --> 00:26:02.753\nAnd it doesn't matter how\ngood our test environment is,\n\n410\n00:26:02.753 --> 00:26:05.430\nit does not mimic identically\nour live environment.\n\n411\n00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:06.724\nYou don't have the same users.\n\n412\n00:26:06.724 --> 00:26:11.859\nIt doesn't matter what simulation\nprograms we have on our test environment,\n\n413\n00:26:11.859 --> 00:26:14.140\nwe don't mimic our users.\n\n414\n00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.675\nYou can't mimic me.\n\n415\n00:26:15.675 --> 00:26:20.100\n[LAUGH] Actually no one can predict\nwhat I'm gonna do with any service.\n\n416\n00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.030\nStop looking at me like that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It\n\n417\n00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:26.400\nsounds a little bit like a challenge, Jo.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n418\n00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.770\n&gt;&gt; But I don't know if it would\n\n419\n00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:32.690\nnecessarily be, I don't know if\nwe have time in this episode,\n\n420\n00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:34.620\nin order to see that come to fruition.\n\n421\n00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.180\nNow, Jo, we've been talking\nabout service level management.\n\n422\n00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.430\nWe haven't really talked about\nsupplier management too much,\n\n423\n00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:41.037\nhave we?\n&gt;&gt; Well, we have.\n\n424\n00:26:41.037 --> 00:26:42.611\n&gt;&gt; Or is it kind of been there steeped in\n\n425\n00:26:42.611 --> 00:26:43.720\nthere?\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n426\n00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.860\nWe have.\n\n427\n00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:48.320\nWhat we're gonna do now is up till now all\nwe've talked about is the proactive part\n\n428\n00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.570\nof service level management and\nsupplier management.\n\n429\n00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:54.180\nYou see,\nwhat we're looking at is right now if\n\n430\n00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.300\nwe take this service integrator layer and\nwe have our customer layer up here,\n\n431\n00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:02.070\nthen supplier management is managing\nthose service level agreements and\n\n432\n00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:05.350\ncontracts with the external\nservice providers.\n\n433\n00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:09.720\nSo supplier management manages\nthe external service providers, and\n\n434\n00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.455\nservice level management manages\nthe internal service providers.\n\n435\n00:27:13.455 --> 00:27:15.415\nBut they're doing exactly the same thing.\n\n436\n00:27:15.415 --> 00:27:18.255\nIt's just that with supplies,\nwe're talking about contracts.\n\n437\n00:27:18.255 --> 00:27:21.685\nWith service level management,\nwe're talking about agreements.\n\n438\n00:27:21.685 --> 00:27:23.425\nSo right now, what we've done is,\n\n439\n00:27:23.425 --> 00:27:27.585\nwe've got our service levels to\nthe point where they've been signed.\n\n440\n00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.260\nNow we've gotta carry on\nwith the business as usual.\n\n441\n00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.560\nBut we're not gonna do that right now.\n\n442\n00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.970\nWe're actually gonna come back.\n\n443\n00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:39.140\nBecause in our part two, in our next\nepisode, we're gonna look at the business\n\n444\n00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:43.700\nas usual side of service level management.\n&gt;&gt; So a part two?\n\n445\n00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:47.570\nI tell you what, you would do a disservice\nto yourself if you miss this.\n\n446\n00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.548\nSo definitely come on back as we continue\nlooking at service level management and\n\n447\n00:27:50.548 --> 00:27:51.440\nsupplier management.\n\n448\n00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.930\nAnd well,\nwe'll be here with business as usual.\n\n449\n00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.820\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget outta here.\n\n450\n00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.094\nSo signing off for ITPRO.TV,\n\n451\n00:27:58.094 --> 00:27:59.902\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n452\n00:27:59.902

Justin,\n\n11\n00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.045\nhow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic other than\n\n12\n00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:40.390\nthe times where I find\nout I don't actually know\n\n13\n00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.990\nanything that I thought I did.\n\n14\n00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.770\nAnd then there's other times that\nI'm victorious where I'm like,\n\n15\n00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.790\nyeah that kind of makes sense.\n\n16\n00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.340\nAnd one of the things in the part one that\nmade sense is we don't set these service\n\n17\n00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.840\nlevel targets kind of in stone until\nwe've hit more or less this steady state.\n\n18\n00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.248\nAnd that's a summation by me, definitely\nmake it right if I got it wrong.\n\n19\n00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:03.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, you're kind of there,\n\n20\n00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.250\nI mean, I like the way you said more or\nless hit the steady state.\n\n21\n00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.730\nWe have this early life support period or\nthis hyper care or\n\n22\n00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.250\nintensive care period after\nwe have deployed a service.\n\n23\n00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.631\nAnd it's only when we have\nexited that particular phase,\n\n24\n00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:24.842\nthat's when we sign our service level\nagreements and their contracts.\n\n25\n00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:29.243\nNow, you may want to tentatively\nsign them or you may wanna sign,\n\n26\n00:01:29.243 --> 00:01:31.250\nespecially with a contract.\n\n27\n00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.768\nYou may wanna sign it, but\n\n28\n00:01:32.768 --> 00:01:37.400\nwith the conditions that you can change\nwithin the first, say, three months.\n\n29\n00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.130\nAnd of course, that then gives\na level of assurance to both your\n\n30\n00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.660\nsupplier and to you.\n\n31\n00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.578\nUltimately what we're saying is that it\nwould not be best practice to agree on\n\n32\n00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:53.393\na service level agreement or\n\n33\n00:01:53.393 --> 00:01:56.963\na contract before you put it\ninto the live environment.\n\n34\n00:01:56.963 --> 00:02:01.933\nBecause you simply do not know how\nthat service is going to behave\n\n35\n00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:04.460\nin that live environment.\n\n36\n00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.570\nSo we don't want to set expectations and\nmake promises,\n\n37\n00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.562\nmake assurances to the customer,\nonly to find that we can't achieve that.\n\n38\n00:02:13.562 --> 00:02:18.490\nQuite often, our test environment,\ndespite the fact that it mimics our live\n\n39\n00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.610\nenvironment and we will say, yes,\nthe test environment is really good.\n\n40\n00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.180\nQuite often, there's something in our test\nenvironment that is slightly different.\n\n41\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.908\nThere's something in our test\nenvironment that's not exactly the same.\n\n42\n00:02:29.908 --> 00:02:31.858\nAnd as I said in a previous episode,\n\n43\n00:02:31.858 --> 00:02:35.050\nyou haven't got the same users\nin your test environment.\n\n44\n00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.630\nEven though you might have some really,\n\n45\n00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.560\nreally good programs to mimic users,\nyou can't always mimic all your users.\n\n46\n00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.430\nNobody can mimic me, and\ndon't even try it, Justin.\n\n47\n00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.496\nAnd nobody can mimic Justin either,\nwe wouldn't want it, no, he's unique.\n\n48\n00:02:49.496 --> 00:02:51.459\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know, Jo,\n\n49\n00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.790\nI feel like some people might.\n\n50\n00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.280\nBut it could be even\nsomething as simple as\n\n51\n00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.240\nother services that are running in the\nlive environment that you're not in that.\n\n52\n00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.652\nYou're like, yeah, I forgot,\nthat's running in the live environment,\n\n53\n00:03:04.652 --> 00:03:06.400\nthat I have to resource share.\n\n54\n00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.003\nAnd then things are now\ninherently different, so\n\n55\n00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:12.330\nyou just try your best, right?\n\n56\n00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.830\nYou should test out things,\nhave a test environment.\n\n57\n00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.563\nGet as close as possible with full\nrealization that things still may be\n\n58\n00:03:18.563 --> 00:03:21.181\ndifferent.\n&gt;&gt; Well, you have to bear in mind that\n\n59\n00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:25.081\nyou've got all of your services\nrunning on the same infrastructure,\n\n60\n00:03:25.081 --> 00:03:28.100\nthey're all running on the same network.\n\n61\n00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.130\nAnd so, as you just mentioned there,\n\n62\n00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.210\nyou've got services that you may\nnot have in your test environment.\n\n63\n00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.770\nOr you've gotta say, what if a service\nfails in the live environment and\n\n64\n00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.200\nthat failure actually impacts that\nservice that you have just deployed?\n\n65\n00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.240\nYou have absolutely no way\nof predicting that, and\n\n66\n00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.810\nit doesn't matter how,\nwhat do I wanna say?\n\n67\n00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.240\nI wanna say it doesn't matter how well\nyour suppliers at this particular level,\n\n68\n00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.810\nat the service provider level,\n\n69\n00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.620\nit doesn't matter how well they\ncommunicate with each other.\n\n70\n00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.130\nThere's still no predicting\nthose types of failures.\n\n71\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.770\nNow, I agree with you,\nI know what you're saying.\n\n72\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.360\nYou're thinking to yourself, well,\nthis could happen at any point in time,\n\n73\n00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.920\nthough, couldn't it?\n\n74\n00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.774\nAnd it could, yes, but let's not try and\n\n75\n00:04:15.774 --> 00:04:23.973\nagree thing before we've got as big\na picture as we possibly can have.\n\n76\n00:04:23.973 --> 00:04:31.101\nAnd you can't have things cast\nin stone when you simply have so\n\n77\n00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:35.087\nmuch that is, well, uncertain.\n\n78\n00:04:35.087 --> 00:04:40.048\nSo let's wait until we\nhave a bedding in period,\n\n79\n00:04:40.048 --> 00:04:46.715\nuntil we have a period in time where\nwe can establish a status quo.\n\n80\n00:04:46.715 --> 00:04:49.050\nI'm not gonna say maintain a status quo,\n\n81\n00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.798\nI'm gonna establish a business\nas usual operating performance.\n\n82\n00:04:52.798 --> 00:04:57.725\nThat's when we can safely say,\nokay, under normal circumstances,\n\n83\n00:04:57.725 --> 00:05:00.850\nthis is how the service would operate.\n\n84\n00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.300\nTherefore, let's sign our\nservice level agreements and\n\n85\n00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.940\nlet's sign our service level targets.\n\n86\n00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.350\nAnd it's that point in time that we\n\n87\n00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.580\ncan start to enforce penalties,\nand we can start to\n\n88\n00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.650\nenforce all of the other incentives that\nwe might have put into our contract.\n\n89\n00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.280\nIt's at that point in time, but\n\n90\n00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.210\nbefore that,\nwe're still having this burgeoning period.\n\n91\n00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.240\nAnd before that,\nwe want to ensure that we're still\n\n92\n00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.960\nable to negotiate the targets in the SLAs,\nbecause they could change.\n\n93\n00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.830\nWe might realize, and by the way, I mean,\n\n94\n00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.070\nthis doesn't work in\na negative way all the time.\n\n95\n00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.910\nWe might actually consider that for\nsome of our services, and I've seen\n\n96\n00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.310\nthis happen as well, that the service\nactually performs better than we expected.\n\n97\n00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.757\nAnd in fact, negotiating our service\nlevel targets means that we can\n\n98\n00:05:50.757 --> 00:05:55.140\nnegotiate our service level targets\nto be the better performance.\n\n99\n00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.460\nTo actually deliver a better performance,\nbecause when we put it into\n\n100\n00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.140\nthe live environment, it worked a lot\nbetter than what we expected it to.\n\n101\n00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.868\nSo it doesn't always work badly, and\n\n102\n00:06:04.868 --> 00:06:07.306\nI know that that's the way\nthat a lot of people think.\n\n103\n00:06:07.306 --> 00:06:11.463\nAnd that's the way there are a lot of\ncustomers think is that, well, you might\n\n104\n00:06:11.463 --> 00:06:15.522\nnot be able to meet those targets,\nthat's why we don't wanna agree just yet.\n\n105\n00:06:15.522 --> 00:06:20.380\nWell, no, cuz we might exceed those\ntargets, so let's adjust them accordingly.\n\n106\n00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.060\nSo now we looked at what happens when\nwe are negotiating our service level\n\n107\n00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.370\nagreements.\n\n108\n00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.310\nI've just got one question,\nactually, before we just move on.\n\n109\n00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.966\nHow long do you think we should\nagree a service level agreement for?\n\n110\n00:06:34.966 --> 00:06:37.476\n&gt;&gt; All right, so how long of a duration\n\n111\n00:06:37.476 --> 00:06:42.499\nshould we say, this is an acceptable,\nwe're going to maintain this,\n\n112\n00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:47.472\nit's that what you're asking?\n&gt;&gt; Not just about maintaining it,\n\n113\n00:06:47.472 --> 00:06:51.771\nbut if you were to agree a contract,\nhow long would you agree it for?\n\n114\n00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:55.036\n&gt;&gt; Jo, this is not my area of expertise,\n\n115\n00:06:55.036 --> 00:06:59.843\nI'm gonna guess a year,\nI'm gonna say a year at a time.\n\n116\n00:06:59.843 --> 00:07:00.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n117\n00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.242\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe the first time is a year, and\n\n118\n00:07:03.242 --> 00:07:08.231\nthen, if things kind of settle out,\nmaybe you have a longer extended option or\n\n119\n00:07:08.231 --> 00:07:11.370\nwhatever it may be.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure about the longer extended\n\n120\n00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.557\noption.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go with a year then, Jo,\n\n121\n00:07:13.557 --> 00:07:15.673\nI'm gonna go with a year [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n122\n00:07:15.673 --> 00:07:21.040\nI mean best practice simply tells\nyou that it needs to be a year.\n\n123\n00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.660\nWe want to have stability, but\nwe also want to ensure that we can,\n\n124\n00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.070\nwell, meet the needs of the organization.\n\n125\n00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.587\nAnd the needs of the organization\nwill change, they simply will.\n\n126\n00:07:31.587 --> 00:07:33.979\nNothing remains static for five years,\n\n127\n00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:37.297\nyour requirements do not remain static for\nfive years.\n\n128\n00:07:37.297 --> 00:07:41.019\nYour organization will change,\nwhether it will grow,\n\n129\n00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:47.150\nwhether it will change the way it does\nbusiness, whether technology will change.\n\n130\n00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:52.935\nThere are so many different factors in\nthere, so a service level agreement,\n\n131\n00:07:52.935 --> 00:07:57.389\nand a contract as well,\nshould be reevaluated every year.\n\n132\n00:07:57.389 --> 00:07:59.542\nSo we'll say at least a year,\n\n133\n00:07:59.542 --> 00:08:04.205\nwe will not say more frequently\nthan that because quite simply.\n\n134\n00:08:04.205 --> 00:08:07.802\nIf you're negotiating service\nlevel targets on a regular basis,\n\n135\n00:08:07.802 --> 00:08:12.440\nif your doing it every three months that's\na really unsettling environment to be in.\n\n136\n00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.930\nI've heard people say but that's agile,\nthat's an agile environment.\n\n137\n00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:25.170\nThat's okay but we can accommodate for\nchanges through our improvement plans.\n\n138\n00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:30.980\nBut, to reevaluate the actually document\nfor relevance, that's done every year.\n\n139\n00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.620\nSo at least once a year,\nthat's when we evaluate it, the thinking.\n\n140\n00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.024\n&gt;&gt; So just to make sure,\n\n141\n00:08:37.024 --> 00:08:38.741\nwe want to make sure that.\n\n142\n00:08:38.741 --> 00:08:40.066\nHowever, we negotiate,\n\n143\n00:08:40.066 --> 00:08:44.488\nwe offer ourselves some fluidity in order\nto say, we need to make some changes here.\n\n144\n00:08:44.488 --> 00:08:49.090\nThe actual re-evaluation of what\nthe targets are, how we're hitting it,\n\n145\n00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:53.970\nlike let's make sure we have this better,\nthat's probably a year at a time, and just\n\n146\n00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.460\nto keep from getting bogged down, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n147\n00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.590\nso we're gonna talk about the improvements\nin a moment because we've only just,\n\n148\n00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.040\nwe've only just got up to the point\nin part 1, and up to now,\n\n149\n00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.290\nwe've only gotten up to the point\nwhere we've got this thing agreed.\n\n150\n00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.470\nNow, we've gotta operate it,\nbusiness as usual.\n\n151\n00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:16.440\nSo yes, we wanna make sure that\nwe've got flexibility in the sort of\n\n152\n00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.230\nthe things aren't going quite right,\nthen we can make some changes but\n\n153\n00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:26.120\nnevertheless, we want to evaluate\nall of our documentation,\n\n154\n00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.590\nincluding our service level agreements and\nour contracts at least once a year.\n\n155\n00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.420\nAnd we evaluate for relevance.\n\n156\n00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:36.026\nSo think about alignment to the needs of\nthe organization cuz the organization may\n\n157\n00:09:36.026 --> 00:09:36.903\nhave changed.\n\n158\n00:09:36.903 --> 00:09:38.158\nI don't know about you.\n\n159\n00:09:38.158 --> 00:09:40.560\nI change my cell phone every.\n\n160\n00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.850\nAnd it's got to the point where most\npeople change their IT quite regularly.\n\n161\n00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.230\n&gt;&gt; Well, Joe, admittedly so,\n\n162\n00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.730\nI'm a little bit of a cheapskate so\n\n163\n00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:52.760\nI use that that thing until it starts\nshorting out, buttons don't work.\n\n164\n00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.570\nBut I do have the option.\n\n165\n00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.900\nThat's just a personal choice.\n\n166\n00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:01.360\nIf I was running it for a business then I\nwould want to make sure I re-evaluate and\n\n167\n00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.900\nsay is this fitting my use case and\nproviding the reliability that I need.\n\n168\n00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.220\nSo it's just a personal device,\nso I'm like come on!\n\n169\n00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.615\nYou're gonna make it today!\n\n170\n00:10:11.615 --> 00:10:13.006\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Dear.\n\n171\n00:10:13.006 --> 00:10:13.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n172\n00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.944\n&gt;&gt; Well, I didn't realize that we\n\n173\n00:10:15.944 --> 00:10:17.842\nwere working with dinosaurs.\n\n174\n00:10:17.842 --> 00:10:20.654\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [SOUND]\n\n175\n00:10:20.654 --> 00:10:22.846\n&gt;&gt; That was a very very bad T-Rex\n\n176\n00:10:22.846 --> 00:10:23.903\nimpression.\n\n177\n00:10:23.903 --> 00:10:28.124\nI think that's what it was and we need to-\n&gt;&gt; I think it was a glorious T-Rex better\n\n178\n00:10:28.124 --> 00:10:30.250\nimpression.\n&gt;&gt; I'm scared.\n\n179\n00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.185\nLet's carry on with\nservice level agreements.\n\n180\n00:10:32.185 --> 00:10:33.390\n&gt;&gt; That's probably a better idea.\n\n181\n00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.522\n&gt;&gt; Cuz this worries me somewhat.\n\n182\n00:10:34.522 --> 00:10:38.050\n[LAUGH] But yeah, we do want to evaluate.\n\n183\n00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:43.480\nYour organization is going to\nbe subject to competitors.\n\n184\n00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.610\nAnd even in the government environment,\n\n185\n00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.460\nout government has got\nto remain relevant also.\n\n186\n00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.380\nSo our IT has got to remain relevant.\n\n187\n00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.360\nIT is no longer just a facilitator.\n\n188\n00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.860\nIT is an intrinsic part of\nevery single organization.\n\n189\n00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.064\nSo things like time to market, etc, well,\n\n190\n00:10:59.064 --> 00:11:02.655\nthat's going to be heavily influenced\nby the technology that we have.\n\n191\n00:11:02.655 --> 00:11:04.889\nSo we have to ensure\nthat we remain relevant.\n\n192\n00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:12.967\nSo we talked about sort of the volumes\nin the structure of the SLA.\n\n193\n00:11:12.967 --> 00:11:16.188\nNow, let's a look back, and\nit's the same as supply or management,\n\n194\n00:11:16.188 --> 00:11:17.839\nit's the same with that contrast.\n\n195\n00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:22.723\nLet's take a look back at purpose\nof the SLA because so far,\n\n196\n00:11:22.723 --> 00:11:25.630\nwe have established in SLA.\n\n197\n00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.420\nAnd now well, we've got to run it.\n\n198\n00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.040\nSo let's take a look back\nat the purpose of an SLM.\n\n199\n00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.970\nAnd our purpose of SLM there is as\n\n200\n00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:40.310\nas it says ensures the performance\nmeet the agreed requirements.\n\n201\n00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.920\nBut so far what we've talked about is\n\n202\n00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.730\nactually defining those\nagreed requirements.\n\n203\n00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:49.920\nSo how do we ensure that the service\nmeets those agreed requirements?\n\n204\n00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.290\nRight.\nWell,\n\n205\n00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.330\nnow we get into the business as usual.\n\n206\n00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.908\nAnd the business as usual is, well,\n\n207\n00:11:58.908 --> 00:12:03.807\na live operating environment and\non a regular basis.\n\n208\n00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:07.200\nAnd by the way once every\nten years is regular.\n\n209\n00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.785\nI'm not advocating once every ten years.\n\n210\n00:12:09.785 --> 00:12:14.891\nOn a regular basis,\nwe need to evaluate the performance of\n\n211\n00:12:14.891 --> 00:12:20.220\nthat service against those\ndefined service level targets.\n\n212\n00:12:21.956 --> 00:12:26.040\nSome organizations will\ndo this every month.\n\n213\n00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.740\nSome organizations will do\nthis every three months.\n\n214\n00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:35.010\nWe will generally advised that certainly\n\n215\n00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:39.420\nwhen you first deploy a new service you\nwant to be doing this on regular basis.\n\n216\n00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.630\nYou want to be at least\nat minimum once a month.\n\n217\n00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.000\nThen, if you want to move to a,\nstability is assured,\n\n218\n00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.980\nif you want to then move to\nperforming your checks, as it were.\n\n219\n00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.650\nAnd we're coming to some of\nthe definitions in a minute.\n\n220\n00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:57.870\nBut if you wanna move into performing\nthose reports every three months,\n\n221\n00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:58.590\nthen that's fine.\n\n222\n00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.550\nAs long as it's on a regular basis,\nI would say,\n\n223\n00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:07.300\npersonally I would say that\nevery six months is too long.\n\n224\n00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.290\nYou want to at least every three months.\n\n225\n00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.680\nBut every one month you might find\nthat that's too frequent for you.\n\n226\n00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.110\nIt really is dependent\non your organization.\n\n227\n00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.920\nIt depends on what the customer\nwants to say, ultimately,\n\n228\n00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.240\nwe're about delivering\nvalue to the customer.\n\n229\n00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.960\nSo on a regular basis,\n\n230\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.290\nwe are going to monitor performance\nagainst those service level targets.\n\n231\n00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:35.940\nDon't forget the complexity,\nbecause we have our three layers.\n\n232\n00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.840\nSo we've got our customer layer.\n\n233\n00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.330\nWe've got our service integrator layer,\nand we've got our service provider layer.\n\n234\n00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:51.350\nSo a customer wants to see how\nthe service is performing as a whole.\n\n235\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:58.040\nWhereas, our service providers,\nwell, our service integrator,\n\n236\n00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:03.880\nwants to see how every single component\nof that service is performing.\n\n237\n00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.330\nBecause it's how all of\nservice providers perform and\n\n238\n00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.600\nhow they meet their obligations.\n\n239\n00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.870\nWell, that's what determines then how our\n\n240\n00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:18.570\nservice is delivered to our customers\nat that top layer in the ecosystem.\n\n241\n00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.675\nSo the service integrator has\na responsibility on a regular\n\n242\n00:14:25.675 --> 00:14:31.215\nbasis then to produce reports to\nmonitor the performance against\n\n243\n00:14:31.215 --> 00:14:37.176\nthe service level targets and\nproduce what we call slam or rag charts.\n\n244\n00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:40.378\nAnd when I said to you we'll come\nacross the terminology, now,\n\n245\n00:14:40.378 --> 00:14:42.052\nwell here's some terminology.\n\n246\n00:14:42.052 --> 00:14:46.543\nSlam chart service level agreement\nmonitoring charts or RAG charts, red,\n\n247\n00:14:46.543 --> 00:14:49.270\namber, green, traffic light charts.\n\n248\n00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:55.390\nThat will show at a glance whether a\nservice is performing on a regular basis.\n\n249\n00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.900\nAnd we will produce those charts and\npresent them to\n\n250\n00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:06.620\nthe customer in what we call\na service review meeting.\n\n251\n00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.810\nWhether that service review meeting is\na physical meeting where you sit down\n\n252\n00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:10.630\nwith the customer.\n\n253\n00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:14.070\nWe would definitely recommend that\nwhen it comes to the customer.\n\n254\n00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:15.790\nThen, sit with them face to face,\n\n255\n00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:19.260\nthe business relationship manager\nshould be involved in that, as well.\n\n256\n00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.550\nOr with a service provider,\n\n257\n00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:24.050\nif that is something that you know\nyou want to do on a virtual basis.\n\n258\n00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:29.390\nThat is entirely up to you but\nthere needs to be a regular formal\n\n259\n00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:34.460\nservice review process\nwhere you have a meeting,\n\n260\n00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.570\na formal meeting, where you discuss\nperformance against the targets.\n\n261\n00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.190\nThis should not be an Adhoc thing.\n\n262\n00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.131\nHaving an Adhoc discussion\nagainst targets.\n\n263\n00:15:44.131 --> 00:15:48.588\nYes, it's needed when there has been\na disaster, when there had been a major\n\n264\n00:15:48.588 --> 00:15:52.785\nincident, when something had gone\nwrong and their needs to be an Ad hoc.\n\n265\n00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:54.884\nYes, we've gotta talk\nabout this right now.\n\n266\n00:15:54.884 --> 00:15:57.576\nBut nevertheless we should have a regular,\n\n267\n00:15:57.576 --> 00:16:02.290\nformal meeting where we discuss\nperformance against those targets.\n\n268\n00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.990\nAnd, of course, the.\n\n269\n00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:08.346\nTime scales in this are really to,\nthey should be aligned\n\n270\n00:16:08.346 --> 00:16:13.258\nwith when you're producing the SLAM\ncharts and the RAG charts.\n\n271\n00:16:13.258 --> 00:16:18.200\nThese are, the SLAM charts, RAG charts,\n\n272\n00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:24.270\nare a representation of\nthe previous performance.\n\n273\n00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.750\nSo the previous three months, for\ninstance, or maybe just the previous\n\n274\n00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:31.116\nmonth, however frequently you're\nhaving these service review meetings.\n\n275\n00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:36.000\nSo and RAG chart, very, very simple, if\nwe're achieving our service level targets,\n\n276\n00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.194\nthen that's green.\n\n277\n00:16:37.194 --> 00:16:42.078\nIf we're about to reach our service\nlevel targets, then that's amber or\n\n278\n00:16:42.078 --> 00:16:45.740\norange or yellow,\nwhatever color you want to use.\n\n279\n00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.427\nAnd then generally,\nif we haven't, if we failed,\n\n280\n00:16:48.427 --> 00:16:52.594\nif we breached the service level target,\nthen that would be represented as red.\n\n281\n00:16:52.594 --> 00:16:57.232\nSo what color do you think I wanna see?\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] I'm prepared for this one.\n\n282\n00:16:57.232 --> 00:16:58.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n283\n00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.890\n&gt;&gt; Not in green, because if we have just\n\n284\n00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:04.330\ngreens across the board, it's kind of\nlike just giving tens on a survey.\n\n285\n00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.800\nIt seems unbelievable, and probably not\nan accurate metric of what your trying.\n\n286\n00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.890\nLike things that\nare interesting are important.\n\n287\n00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.953\n&gt;&gt; It might be an accurate metric.\n\n288\n00:17:15.953 --> 00:17:19.999\nBut I like what you said about things\nthat are interesting are things that\n\n289\n00:17:19.999 --> 00:17:20.940\nare important.\n\n290\n00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:27.080\nAnd the simple fact is that we\nare delivering value to our customers,\n\n291\n00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.030\nthat's what we're doing.\n\n292\n00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:34.213\nValue is perceived, and\nso we have got to measure\n\n293\n00:17:34.213 --> 00:17:38.950\nwhether we are delivering\nvalue to the customer.\n\n294\n00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:44.000\nI can tell you now, and I have walked\nin to thousands of organizations where\n\n295\n00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.912\nthey show me these wonderful SLAM charts,\nand they've all been green.\n\n296\n00:17:48.912 --> 00:17:49.420\nAnd they've said to me,\nlook at how we're delivering.\n\n297\n00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.290\nAnd then I've walked out to\nthe customers and the customers side.\n\n298\n00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.358\nAnd I said, what do you think of IT?\n\n299\n00:17:54.358 --> 00:17:59.400\nAnd their perception has been completely\nthe opposite of the SLAM charts.\n\n300\n00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:05.520\nBecause their perception is that IT, the\nservice provider, the service integrator,\n\n301\n00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.510\nthey are just simply trying to achieve\na nice pretty green SLAM chart, and\n\n302\n00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:11.330\nthat's it.\n\n303\n00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.600\nThey're not actually interested\nin service delivery.\n\n304\n00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.248\nI will tell you that if\nI'm seeing a SLAM chart,\n\n305\n00:18:20.248 --> 00:18:25.190\na RAG chart that is all green,\nthen you're measuring the wrong thing.\n\n306\n00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.840\nBecause you need to be demonstrating in\n\n307\n00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.960\nyour RAG charts that you\nare delivering value to the customer.\n\n308\n00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:37.370\nThis is not just about putting a tick in a\nbox and saying, yes, we've achieved that.\n\n309\n00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.070\nWe need to be highlighting\nwhere we can improve.\n\n310\n00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:46.530\nWhere we can improve our alignment\nagainst business priorities,\n\n311\n00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:50.410\nwhere we can improve our value perception.\n\n312\n00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:54.110\nAnd if everything's showing green,\nthen that tells me that that's great.\n\n313\n00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:58.650\nThat you've ticked some boxes and you're\nmeeting all of your service level targets.\n\n314\n00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.990\nBut what about that service level\ntarget on value perception?\n\n315\n00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.990\nDo you have a service level\ntarget on value perception?\n\n316\n00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.789\nYou should.\nYou should definitely have a service level\n\n317\n00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:08.940\ntarget for that.\n\n318\n00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:15.640\nSo I want to see SLAM charts that\nhave got some color in them.\n\n319\n00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.430\nI want to see where we can improve.\n\n320\n00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.565\nI do not want to see\nan all green RAG chart,\n\n321\n00:19:20.565 --> 00:19:22.830\ncuz an all green RAG\nchart tells me nothing.\n\n322\n00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.740\nA report, when we consider knowledge\nmanagement, knowledge management is about\n\n323\n00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.750\nhaving information available to\nus to allow us to make decisions.\n\n324\n00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.290\nAnd a report should allow\nus to make a decision.\n\n325\n00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:41.140\nIf I've seen an all green RAG chart,\nthere's only one decision that I can make.\n\n326\n00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.000\nAnd that is I need to\nimprove what I'm measuring\n\n327\n00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.260\nbecause that RAG chart tells me nothing.\n\n328\n00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.282\nNow, sometimes, though,\n\n329\n00:19:49.282 --> 00:19:54.145\nwe can struggle with this because we can\nstruggle with presenting to the customer.\n\n330\n00:19:54.145 --> 00:19:57.625\nAnd I'm not telling you, by the way,\nthat you need a RAG chart that's all red.\n\n331\n00:19:57.625 --> 00:20:01.520\nNow, sometimes we can struggle presenting\nto the customer a RAG chart that's not all\n\n332\n00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.290\ngreen, because we want the customer\nto see that we're doing really well,\n\n333\n00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.370\nthat we're meeting everything\nthat we've agreed to.\n\n334\n00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:10.770\nSo there has to be an honesty.\n\n335\n00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:14.860\nThere has to be a trust between both the\nservice integrator and the customer, but\n\n336\n00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:19.850\nalso between the service providers and\nthe service integrator as well.\n\n337\n00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:25.270\nSeeing red and seeing orange on\na RAG chart is not a bad thing.\n\n338\n00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:29.030\nIt allows us to make\nimprovements to our service.\n\n339\n00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.580\nAnd that's what it is\nthat we're aiming to do.\n\n340\n00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.380\nSo this is conducted on a regular basis.\n\n341\n00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.810\nIt's up to you to decide\nwhat is regular for you.\n\n342\n00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:42.340\nYou may choose, the service integrators\nmay choose to produce the SLAM chart with\n\n343\n00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:46.800\nthe customer on a three monthly basis,\nbut individual SLAM\n\n344\n00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:51.780\ncharts with your individual service\nproviders on a monthly basis.\n\n345\n00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.310\nThat's entirely up to you.\n\n346\n00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:58.228\nIt's your ecosystem, you're going\nto have to make those decisions\n\n347\n00:20:58.228 --> 00:21:00.950\nas to the frequency of these reviews.\n\n348\n00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:05.659\nWe would definitely tell you that,\ncertainly at the very\n\n349\n00:21:05.659 --> 00:21:10.271\nbeginning of a deployment,\nthen we should be doing this\n\n350\n00:21:10.271 --> 00:21:15.274\na lot more frequently than as\nthe service becomes budget in,\n\n351\n00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:21.390\nthen you can elongate those service\nreview meetings, most definitely.\n\n352\n00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:26.580\nSo one of the reasons why we\nhave a service review meeting\n\n353\n00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.750\nis because we want to gauge customer\nperception, we wanna get feedback from\n\n354\n00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:36.080\nthe customer, but also because we want\nto discuss improvement initiatives.\n\n355\n00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:41.890\nThe output from a service review\nmeeting is an improvement plan.\n\n356\n00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.900\nAnd that's to both contacts and\nperformance against the contracts,\n\n357\n00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.670\nwhich supply and\n\n358\n00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:49.200\nmanagement is going to be managing\nwith our external service providers.\n\n359\n00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:54.840\nAnd also internally with our\ninternal service providers as well,\n\n360\n00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.080\nto discuss improvements.\n\n361\n00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:03.960\nAnd improvements could that quite simply\nfor the last three RAG charts we've had\n\n362\n00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:08.640\nan amber at a particular sticking point,\nand we want to improve on that, okay?\n\n363\n00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:14.210\nSo this is where we discuss\nimprovement initiatives, and\n\n364\n00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:18.820\nwe get agreement to progress with\nthose improvement initiatives.\n\n365\n00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:23.280\nAnd then, again, in the next meeting, that\nimprovement initiative should be revisited\n\n366\n00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.070\nto see whether we have achieved that or\nnot.\n\n367\n00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:31.680\nSo on a regular basis, in our last\nepisode we looked at agreeing and\n\n368\n00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.960\ndefining those service level targets.\n\n369\n00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.220\nAnd now what we're doing is, in this\nparticular episode, we have analysed and\n\n370\n00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:45.460\nwe've looked at how we manage those\nservice level targets on a regular basis.\n\n371\n00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:49.950\nRemember that for service level management\nand for supplier management, we've got to\n\n372\n00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:56.330\nensure that service performance meets or\nexceeds the agreed service level target.\n\n373\n00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:59.780\nSo here we are delivering the service.\n\n374\n00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:04.470\nIn our last episode we prepared\nthe service and we prepared the thresholds\n\n375\n00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:08.130\nwithin, or parameters, within which\nwe were gonna deliver a service.\n\n376\n00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:09.820\nNow we're delivering it.\n\n377\n00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.480\nBut we have to ensure on a regular\nbasis that we're carrying on and\n\n378\n00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.740\nmeeting the needs of the organization.\n\n379\n00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.820\nThis is not just a one-off exercise.\n\n380\n00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:22.525\nThe thing that we're not trying to do is\nto just deliver a service immediately once\n\n381\n00:23:22.525 --> 00:23:26.818\nit's been deployed, and then kind of\nwash our hands a bit and say, right,\n\n382\n00:23:26.818 --> 00:23:28.611\nthat's it, now we're done.\n\n383\n00:23:28.611 --> 00:23:32.390\n[LAUGH] You've got what you wanted,\nand it's time to move on.\n\n384\n00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:33.928\nThat's not the case.\n\n385\n00:23:33.928 --> 00:23:39.230\nAnd so here, with service level\nmanagement, we carry on managing\n\n386\n00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:44.170\nthose services and ensure that they're\ndelivered to those agreed targets.\n\n387\n00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:49.790\nAnd we do that right away until\nthe retirement of that service.\n\n388\n00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:53.230\nService level management never\nwashes his hands and walks away.\n\n389\n00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:55.900\nService level management carries on\n\n390\n00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.140\nright away through until\nthe retirement of that service.\n\n391\n00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.420\nAnd it's only then,\nonce the service has been retired,\n\n392\n00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:07.970\nthat service level management will then\ncease for that particular service.\n\n393\n00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.730\nSo what we've done in the last two\nepisodes is that we have looked at\n\n394\n00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:17.080\nboth service level and\nsupplier management.\n\n395\n00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:22.840\nWe have looked at the entire life of a\nservice level agreement and of a contract.\n\n396\n00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:27.350\nNow, in a previous episode, you will see\nthat we covered contract management.\n\n397\n00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:29.794\nAnd contract management\nis slightly different,\n\n398\n00:24:29.794 --> 00:24:33.820\nbecause contract management looked at sort\nof the nuts and bolts of the contract.\n\n399\n00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.895\nSo actually managing\nthe legalities of the contract.\n\n400\n00:24:36.895 --> 00:24:41.315\nHere what we're doing is,\nin service level and supplier management,\n\n401\n00:24:41.315 --> 00:24:45.135\nis that we are looking at managing\nthe delivery of the service.\n\n402\n00:24:45.135 --> 00:24:48.055\nSo ensuring that we get\nall the parameters right.\n\n403\n00:24:48.055 --> 00:24:53.345\nAnd then managing the complexity of the\ndelivery across various service providers.\n\n404\n00:24:53.345 --> 00:24:57.525\nWhether they be internal, or\nwhether they be external.\n\n405\n00:24:57.525 --> 00:24:58.955\nSo service level management and\n\n406\n00:24:58.955 --> 00:25:04.170\nsupplier management are pretty\nmuch wanting the same process,\n\n407\n00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:08.660\nit's only that one deals with external\nservice providers, and another deals with\n\n408\n00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:12.582\ninternal service providers.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jo, there's definitely a lot to\n\n409\n00:25:12.582 --> 00:25:15.714\nunpack and this needed two episodes,\nbut if I'm not mistaken,\n\n410\n00:25:15.714 --> 00:25:19.490\nwe're not finished with processes, are we?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not, no.\n\n411\n00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:21.852\nWe've got many more episodes to come.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n412\n00:25:21.852 --> 00:25:23.980\nyou should definitely stay tuned for\nthose.\n\n413\n00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.250\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n414\n00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.490\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n415\n00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:30.460\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n416\n00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.180\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n417\n00:25:33.180 -->

00:00:08.241\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:13.031\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.031 --> 00:00:15.814\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.814 --> 00:00:18.290\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\nwe're coming back at you.\n\n7\n00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.120\nWell you asked for it, so\nwe're bringing it back.\n\n8\n00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.670\nSIAM foundation and\n\n9\n00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.770\nwe're looking at another process\nconfiguration management in this episode.\n\n10\n00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.958\nLuckily, we have someone who's going to,\nwell, take us by the hand and\n\n11\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.277\nlead us down the path of\nconfiguration management.\n\n12\n00:00:32.277 --> 00:00:34.148\nThe one, the only, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n13\n00:00:34.148 --> 00:00:36.437\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Justin.\n\n14\n00:00:36.437 --> 00:00:38.349\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic,\n\n15\n00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:41.929\nespecially after that intro,\nwhich I think went rather well.\n\n16\n00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:43.818\nBut configuration management to me.\n&gt;&gt; I'm\n\n17\n00:00:43.818 --> 00:00:44.545\nscared.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:45.106\n&gt;&gt; I am scared,\n\n19\n00:00:45.106 --> 00:00:47.648\nI wanna know what you want-\n&gt;&gt; Configuration management to me means\n\n20\n00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:48.717\nsomething very particular.\n\n21\n00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:54.455\nIt's typically about hardware, but\nthat has to do with my bias, right?\n\n22\n00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:58.485\nJust as a developer with,\nyou know sometimes l have to put on my,\n\n23\n00:00:58.485 --> 00:01:02.670\nmy ops hat every once in awhile.\n&gt;&gt; You don't do any software work at all?\n\n24\n00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.761\nIs that what you're saying,\nyou're a developer,\n\n25\n00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:07.449\nof course you do.\n&gt;&gt; I am talking about the configuration\n\n26\n00:01:07.449 --> 00:01:11.585\nfor me, the hard part is the hardware,\nso that tends to be where my mind goes.\n\n27\n00:01:11.585 --> 00:01:14.509\nl'm not saying there isn't\nsoftware involved in\n\n28\n00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:15.269\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; But,\n\n29\n00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:19.405\nI got a funny feeling there is a lot more-\n&gt;&gt; No one ever knows where his mind goes.\n\n30\n00:01:19.405 --> 00:01:20.827\nI don't know what we're\ntalking about here.\n\n31\n00:01:20.827 --> 00:01:24.604\n&gt;&gt; That's all right, sometimes, goldfish.\n\n32\n00:01:24.604 --> 00:01:29.062\nBut I know there's a lot more facets\nto this than just those hardware,\n\n33\n00:01:29.062 --> 00:01:31.559\nsoftware components.\n&gt;&gt; So configuring management,\n\n34\n00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:33.742\nwhat are we actually talking about here?\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay,\n\n35\n00:01:33.742 --> 00:01:36.829\nwell let's just take a quick\nlook on the screen right now.\n\n36\n00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.012\nAnd you'll see that\nthe purpose of configuration\n\n37\n00:01:40.012 --> 00:01:44.631\nmanagement is really to well it says\nidentify, record, maintain, and\n\n38\n00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:48.360\nassure data and\ninformation about configuration items.\n\n39\n00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.930\nAssure data and information,\nin other words what we've got\n\n40\n00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.180\nlook at what we've got to\nassure is the integrity of\n\n41\n00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.610\nthe information about our configuration\nitems, or our CIs as we like to call them.\n\n42\n00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.320\nSo we're gonna have a database for\nour configuration items.\n\n43\n00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:16.290\nI just wanna bring in before we\nget started really on this one.\n\n44\n00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.110\nI've got to sow the seeds, and I've got\nto talk to you about the complexity\n\n45\n00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.820\nof configuration management\nwithin a SIAM ecosystem.\n\n46\n00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.190\nNow I know that I've spoken about\ncomplexity in many other episodes so far.\n\n47\n00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.693\nJust a quick refresher,\nwe've got our service integrator layer,\n\n48\n00:02:36.693 --> 00:02:41.838\nwe've got our customer layer, and then\nwe've got all of our service providers.\n\n49\n00:02:41.838 --> 00:02:45.347\nConfiguration management sits in\nthat service integrator layer.\n\n50\n00:02:47.178 --> 00:02:53.168\nAll of our service providers will provide\nus with various components of a service,\n\n51\n00:02:53.168 --> 00:02:56.860\nor with various configuration\nitems of a service.\n\n52\n00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.300\nAnd at our service integrator layer,\nthat's where we integrate all of those\n\n53\n00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.060\ncomponents, and then we deliver\nthe service to the customer.\n\n54\n00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.180\nSo this is where we're gathering\nall of that information.\n\n55\n00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.320\nSo this is where we're going to have\nour configuration management system or\n\n56\n00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.230\nconfiguration management database\nwhere we store all of that\n\n57\n00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.714\ninformation that we've mentioned.\n\n58\n00:03:23.714 --> 00:03:28.285\nLet's look at the term configuration item.\n\n59\n00:03:28.285 --> 00:03:30.200\nCuz I've used the word component as well,\nand\n\n60\n00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.600\nthey both mean pretty much the same thing.\n\n61\n00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.010\nAlthough we're gonna start now and\nrefer to it as a CI,\n\n62\n00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.120\nonce we've explained what a CI is.\n\n63\n00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.613\nI'm gonna start referring to it as a CI,\na configuration item,\n\n64\n00:03:41.613 --> 00:03:44.850\nbecause from my perspective or\nfrom your perspective, and\n\n65\n00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.910\ncertainly as we move forward\ninto this SIAM ecosystem.\n\n66\n00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.095\nAnd as you look at your\nfoundation examination then,\n\n67\n00:03:52.095 --> 00:03:56.655\nyeah we're gonna refer to it as a CI and\nnot as a component.\n\n68\n00:03:56.655 --> 00:03:59.367\nA component of our service or\n\n69\n00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:05.360\na CI Is what is needed in order to\nbe able to deliver the service.\n\n70\n00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.310\nNow if you remember,\n\n71\n00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.050\nthe definition of a service is about\ndelivering value by facilitating outcomes.\n\n72\n00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.330\nSo let's just say that\nthe outcome of a service is to,\n\n73\n00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.950\nor the outcome that we want to facilitate,\nis to send and receive email.\n\n74\n00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.040\nSo by the power of modern\ntechnology then we've got this nice\n\n75\n00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.060\nnifty little tool that's gonna\nhelp us out with this one.\n\n76\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.640\nSo let's consider the service as being\nan ability to send and receive email.\n\n77\n00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.869\nThat's the service that we want\nto deliver to our customer,\n\n78\n00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:41.735\ncuz our customer wants\ntheir outcomes facilitated.\n\n79\n00:04:41.735 --> 00:04:43.698\nRemember the definition, yeah?\n\n80\n00:04:43.698 --> 00:04:48.760\nIt's about delivering value by\nfacilitating their outcomes.\n\n81\n00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.580\nSo in order to facilitate the outcome\nof sending and receiving email,\n\n82\n00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.640\nlet's put Justin on the spot a little bit,\nshall we, why not?\n\n83\n00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.220\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you what,\n\n84\n00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.400\nit seems like a favorite\npast time in this series,\n\n85\n00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.830\nI'm not even gonna lie.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, why not, right?\n\n86\n00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.000\nLet's just watch him for a little while.\n\n87\n00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.279\nWatch the facial expressions,\nthey're always a joy.\n\n88\n00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:09.493\nWhat do I need in order to send and\nreceive email,\n\n89\n00:05:09.493 --> 00:05:10.016\nJustin?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n90\n00:05:10.016 --> 00:05:11.365\nI need an email client.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n91\n00:05:11.365 --> 00:05:15.022\nokay hang on give me two seconds\nlet me just write this one up, so\n\n92\n00:05:15.022 --> 00:05:20.729\nwe need some software.\n&gt;&gt; I need\n\n93\n00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.137\na computer to run the email client on it.\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, well,\n\n94\n00:05:24.137 --> 00:05:27.705\nI don't just need a computer but, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You also need like,\n\n95\n00:05:27.705 --> 00:05:30.681\nInternet connectivity, or\nconnectivity to a network,\n\n96\n00:05:30.681 --> 00:05:33.748\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yes I do, I do,\n\n97\n00:05:33.748 --> 00:05:38.964\nI need some infrastructure.\n&gt;&gt; You need\n\n98\n00:05:38.964 --> 00:05:45.834\nsomeone to send an email to.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n99\n00:05:45.834 --> 00:05:49.088\nWell it's not wrong.\n\n100\n00:05:49.088 --> 00:05:50.688\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n101\n00:05:51.936 --> 00:05:54.784\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, send and receive emails,\n\n102\n00:05:54.784 --> 00:05:58.408\nI need a computer,\nI need the hardware software,\n\n103\n00:05:58.408 --> 00:06:03.673\nI need the infrastructure which is\nthe network, I need someone to send or\n\n104\n00:06:03.673 --> 00:06:07.887\nreceive to, and I need power.\n&gt;&gt; You do right, yeah, and\n\n105\n00:06:07.887 --> 00:06:12.543\npeople will forget about that but\nI just don't need power.\n\n106\n00:06:12.543 --> 00:06:17.640\nI also need an entire environment.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that make sense.\n\n107\n00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.278\nSo sometimes I'm guilty of that,\nI'm like I need a hardware.\n\n108\n00:06:20.278 --> 00:06:25.470\nBut if it's not plugged up, or it's not\nmoderated by temperature, or it's not,\n\n109\n00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.370\nthere's all these other factors that-\n&gt;&gt; Well simply, if you don't have anywhere\n\n110\n00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.480\nto sit, you're not gonna send and\nreceive email for very long.\n\n111\n00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.490\nYou could only stand outside for certain\namount of time before you lose both power,\n\n112\n00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.530\nbattery, and\n\n113\n00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.430\nalso before your legs get tired.\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n114\n00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.350\nin my case you get horribly sun burnt.\n\n115\n00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.796\nAnd you're like, email is not worth it.\n&gt;&gt; Right like,\n\n116\n00:06:46.796 --> 00:06:49.100\nhow important was that email?\n\n117\n00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.476\nSo, we've got something\nelse that we need as well.\n\n118\n00:06:51.476 --> 00:06:56.046\n&gt;&gt; So all right, infrastructure.\n\n119\n00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:04.165\nI have no idea, I have no idea.\n&gt;&gt; We've gotta have agreements,\n\n120\n00:07:04.165 --> 00:07:06.230\nwe gotta have an agreement in place.\n\n121\n00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:12.220\nYou can only send and receive email for so\nlong, [LAUGH] on a trial period, right?\n\n122\n00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.720\nYou need to have a contract with\nsomebody for your infrastructure,\n\n123\n00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.730\nyou need to have agreements in place for\nwhen you can send and receive email.\n\n124\n00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:27.425\nSo I'm gonna call that, well or\nrather not, see look at this.\n\n125\n00:07:27.425 --> 00:07:31.303\nThe wonders of modern technology means\nthat you can now see that I definitely\n\n126\n00:07:31.303 --> 00:07:39.112\ncan't write.\n&gt;&gt; Documentation,\n\n127\n00:07:39.112 --> 00:07:43.101\nwhere would we be without documentation?\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay,\n\n128\n00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:49.110\ndocumentation, so these are what we call,\nremember that acronym, the CI's?\n\n129\n00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.213\nThese are the configuration\nitems of our service.\n\n130\n00:07:53.213 --> 00:07:57.021\nWhen you think CI,\npeople will automatically you did,\n\n131\n00:07:57.021 --> 00:07:58.402\nI know what you did.\n\n132\n00:07:58.402 --> 00:08:02.549\nThey automatically think of\nconfiguration of a PC for instance.\n\n133\n00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:04.139\nThis is exactly the same,\n\n134\n00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:07.960\nonly it's the configuration of\na service in it's entirety.\n\n135\n00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.490\nIt's the same thing, it's just scaled up.\n\n136\n00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:16.430\nSo configuration management is\nabout assuring the integrity of all\n\n137\n00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:22.140\nof this, of all of the data on\nthe screen that's in front of you.\n\n138\n00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.022\nSo FCIs will have to\nhave certain information.\n\n139\n00:08:26.022 --> 00:08:30.849\nFCIs will have to have information\nlike say, asset numbers, and\n\n140\n00:08:30.849 --> 00:08:34.250\nserial numbers, these are all attributes.\n\n141\n00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.120\nSo for our hardware,\nthen we're talking asset numbers,\n\n142\n00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.830\nwe're talking serial numbers,\nwe're talking the size of the hard drive.\n\n143\n00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:45.410\nWe're talking about the memory, but don't\nthink of hardware as just your PC either.\n\n144\n00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.140\nThis is what I mentioned\nwhen I said to you.\n\n145\n00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.133\nBut when it comes to hardware,\nwe're not just talking about PCs,\n\n146\n00:08:50.133 --> 00:08:51.367\nyou've also got service.\n\n147\n00:08:51.367 --> 00:08:53.485\nYou've got physical racks,\n\n148\n00:08:53.485 --> 00:08:58.530\nyou've got a lot of hardware that\nyou don't ordinarily think of.\n\n149\n00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.953\nBut without anyone of\nthose pieces of hardware,\n\n150\n00:09:00.953 --> 00:09:04.100\nyou're no gonna be able to send and\nreceive email.\n\n151\n00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.880\nIt's the same with software.\n\n152\n00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.550\nWith our software,\nyou've gotta have an operating system,\n\n153\n00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.650\nyou've gotta have a server.\n\n154\n00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.420\nYou've gotta have firmware.\n\n155\n00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.360\nYou've gotta have middleware, potentially.\n\n156\n00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.960\nYou've also got to have your\noperating system on your laptop,\n\n157\n00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.130\ndesktop, client device,\nwhatever that may be.\n\n158\n00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.130\nAnd then of course,\n\n159\n00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:28.990\nthe environment as we've mentioned\nthings like, power, somewhere to seat.\n\n160\n00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:33.920\nPeople, that's an interesting one,\nit's not just about sending to a person.\n\n161\n00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.608\nIt's also about somebody to\nsupport it when it goes wrong.\n\n162\n00:09:38.608 --> 00:09:42.310\nCuz it will, at some point in time,\nyou're gonna need to call somebody\n\n163\n00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.700\nwith a question even if it's a request,\nyou're still gonna need to call somebody.\n\n164\n00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.730\nSo you need to have\ninformation about people.\n\n165\n00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.841\nAnd also our infrastructure as well.\n\n166\n00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:56.560\nThe physical cables, how it hangs together\nbut also our management infrastructure.\n\n167\n00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.450\nWho do I call when something goes wrong?\n\n168\n00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:02.390\nThis is really important in the Siam\necosystem because of course, all of\n\n169\n00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:06.960\nthese components could potentially be\nsupplied by different service providers.\n\n170\n00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.900\nWhich means that of course, we've got\nto have the relevant agreements and\n\n171\n00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.332\nthe relevant contracts in place\nwith those services providers.\n\n172\n00:10:14.332 --> 00:10:19.470\nThat's our documentation, and\nwithout that, it's not gonna happen.\n\n173\n00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.720\nWe're not gonna be able to assure\n\n174\n00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.570\nthe customer of our ability to send and\nreceive email in this instance.\n\n175\n00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.560\nBut we need this in one single place.\n\n176\n00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.120\nYou don't want all of this information\nthat we've got in front of us right now,\n\n177\n00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.200\nwe do not want in different places.\n\n178\n00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:47.280\nIf you have it in different places, then,\nwell, who's to say which one's accurate?\n\n179\n00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.060\nSo we want a single source\nof consistent information.\n\n180\n00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:56.580\nWhich means that we're going to have, and\nI'm gonna put something else in here.\n\n181\n00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.127\nWe're gonna have to have relationships.\n\n182\n00:11:06.285 --> 00:11:10.059\nAnd that's relationships\nbetween our data sources and\n\n183\n00:11:10.059 --> 00:11:13.220\nthat's also relationships between our CIs.\n\n184\n00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.678\nCan you imagine when a customer\ncalls the service desk,\n\n185\n00:11:16.678 --> 00:11:21.050\nthe person that they ask for\nis generally the user ID of that person.\n\n186\n00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.930\nAnd when they input the user ID into\ntheir call log in system, then their call\n\n187\n00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:31.597\nlog in system should interrogate our\nconfiguration management system.\n\n188\n00:11:31.597 --> 00:11:37.020\nAnd from our call log in system,\nwe should be able to identify a person.\n\n189\n00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.740\nWhat hardware they're using?\n\n190\n00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.430\nWhat software sits on their hardware?\n\n191\n00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.610\nWhereabouts that person is set?\n\n192\n00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.573\nAnd because we know where they're set,\n\n193\n00:11:45.573 --> 00:11:48.810\nwe also know what portion of\nthe infrastructure they used.\n\n194\n00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:53.140\nAnd because we know what software they're\nusing, we also know what service level\n\n195\n00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:57.590\nagreements and what contract supply to\nthe software and to the hardware, etc.\n\n196\n00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.010\nThese are all relationships.\n\n197\n00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:06.090\nAnd what's really important in\nconfiguration management is,\n\n198\n00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:10.360\nthat you understand as\nthe service integrator,\n\n199\n00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.290\nnot only what components you have for\neach service.\n\n200\n00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:20.070\nSo what configurations\nitems that you understand\n\n201\n00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.780\nall of the relationships between\nthose configuration items.\n\n202\n00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:28.210\nAnd that you understand the attributes\nof those configuration items as well.\n\n203\n00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:33.510\nSo attributes such as for a laptop,\nthe size of the hard drive and\n\n204\n00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:38.000\nthe amount of memory, etc, and\nthe operating system for instance.\n\n205\n00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.690\nThese are all considered attributes.\n\n206\n00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.740\nWe need to have that source,\n\n207\n00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.890\npreferably a single source of accurate and\nreliable information.\n\n208\n00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.270\nBecause we need to assure our customer,\n\n209\n00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.890\nthat we have accurate information\nabout what makes up their service.\n\n210\n00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.670\nSo now I want to take,\nI wanna just go a little\n\n211\n00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:06.240\nbit outside of configuration management\nand think how important this is to people.\n\n212\n00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.910\nSo when you look at, you've got your CIs\non the screen in front of you right now.\n\n213\n00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:14.870\nI've already mentioned incident management\nusing all of those relationships.\n\n214\n00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.524\nSo when incident management,\n\n215\n00:13:17.524 --> 00:13:23.148\nwhen somebody calls up the service\ndesk and they give the user ID.\n\n216\n00:13:23.148 --> 00:13:27.812\nAnd they, [COUGH] excuse me, the service\ndesk then takes that user ID and\n\n217\n00:13:27.812 --> 00:13:32.040\ngoes through all that information,\nand we already have it.\n\n218\n00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.940\nAnd it's already up to date.\n\n219\n00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.020\nWell, let's think about\nchange management then,\n\n220\n00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:40.560\nchange management wants to swap\nout a router, or a router.\n\n221\n00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.890\nSo, we start off, and hopefully this\nis gonna come up in a different color,\n\n222\n00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.390\nchange management starts off by going\ninto our configuration management, and\n\n223\n00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:53.330\ntaking the asset number of that\nportion of the infrastructure.\n\n224\n00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.710\nAnd because we have that,\nthen we know where it is.\n\n225\n00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:01.730\nBecause we know where it is, well,\nwe also know what people are using it.\n\n226\n00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.630\nBut we also know what hardware it is,\n\n227\n00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:08.940\nwe know because we know what people are\nusing it, what software they're using, but\n\n228\n00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.510\nalso any software or\nfirmware that might be on that router.\n\n229\n00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.010\nAnd because we know what hardware it is,\nwe know who supplies it, and\n\n230\n00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:20.272\nthen we know for, or\ntherefore we know what documentation\n\n231\n00:14:20.272 --> 00:14:24.910\nthere is, relating to that particular CI.\n\n232\n00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.520\nBecause we know where it sits,\nbecause we know what people\n\n233\n00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.300\nare using that particular router,\nthen when it comes to swapping it out,\n\n234\n00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.360\nwe know what the level of\nimpact of that change is.\n\n235\n00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.210\nAnd we have got all of that\ninformation at a glance.\n\n236\n00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.650\nWhich is why it's really important when\nit comes to configuration management\n\n237\n00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.970\nthat we maintain\nthe integrity of our data.\n\n238\n00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:53.740\nAnd that we also maintain\nthe integrity of our data sources, and\n\n239\n00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.210\nof our database itself.\n\n240\n00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:01.200\nWe are going to be using in order to\nensure the accuracy, we're gonna be\n\n241\n00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.945\nusing tools like Network Detection Tools\nto see what's on our network.\n\n242\n00:15:05.945 --> 00:15:10.500\nWe're going to be ensuring that change\nmanagement, when they make any changes to\n\n243\n00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.732\nany of those CIs, that they are reflected\nin that configuration management system.\n\n244\n00:15:14.732 --> 00:15:19.560\nAnd we're also going to be ensuring\nthat when there's an incident,\n\n245\n00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.600\nto do with any of those CIs, then again if\nit's swappy, something is swapped out, or\n\n246\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:30.230\nupdated, then we update our\nconfiguration management system.\n\n247\n00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:36.140\nIf we don't, if we allow this to\nbe managed by disparate parties,\n\n248\n00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:44.270\nif we allow this to be managed on an\nindividual basis by our service providers.\n\n249\n00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.198\nThen we're going to see very, well,\nnegative impact, very harmful changes\n\n250\n00:15:50.198 --> 00:15:54.539\nbeing implemented, and a lot of\nnegative impact from those changes.\n\n251\n00:15:54.539 --> 00:15:58.650\nWe're going to see incidents not\nresolved because we simply don't\n\n252\n00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:01.037\nunderstand the scope of the incident.\n\n253\n00:16:01.037 --> 00:16:02.662\nOr we actually don't know.\n\n254\n00:16:02.662 --> 00:16:05.883\nWe don't have the full picture to\nbe able to resolve an incident.\n\n255\n00:16:05.883 --> 00:16:09.067\nAnd then exactly the same with\nthe problem, we're not gonna\n\n256\n00:16:09.067 --> 00:16:13.410\nbe able to identify potential points of\nfailure, or even resolve the root cause.\n\n257\n00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:17.550\nBecause we can't get\nquite to that root cause.\n\n258\n00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.720\nBecause we don't have the full picture.\n\n259\n00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.030\nAnd we don't understand how our\ninfrastructure's held together.\n\n260\n00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:28.872\nSo configuration management is always\nimportant in any IT environment,\n\n261\n00:16:28.872 --> 00:16:31.378\nit's always incredibly important.\n\n262\n00:16:31.378 --> 00:16:34.192\nBut in a SIAM ecosystem it's even more so,\n\n263\n00:16:34.192 --> 00:16:38.414\nbecause our data sources for\nall of those configuration items,\n\n264\n00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:43.560\nour data sources are gonna be different,\nthey're gonna be disparate.\n\n265\n00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.004\nAnd that means that we need\nto have a central place\n\n266\n00:16:47.004 --> 00:16:51.627\nto store all of that information\nabout our configuration items.\n\n267\n00:16:51.627 --> 00:16:56.092\nSo Justin, when you came into\nthis particular episode,\n\n268\n00:16:56.092 --> 00:16:58.720\nyou were a little bit confused.\n\n269\n00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.670\nWell, no, all right, you weren't confused.\n\n270\n00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.060\nYou were thinking\npredominantly about hardware.\n\n271\n00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.849\nBut do you understand really what\nthe importance of overall configuration\n\n272\n00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:09.837\nmanagement is?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can definitely see the utility,\n\n273\n00:17:09.837 --> 00:17:13.748\nbecause if we don't kind of unify this,\nright, we were talking about these\n\n274\n00:17:13.748 --> 00:17:18.206\ndatabases, then a single service provider\ngoes, well this is a good time for us,\n\n275\n00:17:18.206 --> 00:17:22.860\nwithout considering the widespread\nramifications of those respective changes.\n\n276\n00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.370\nWhat people is that going to interrupt?\n\n277\n00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:25.870\nHow's it going to change the enviroment?\n\n278\n00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:27.480\nIf any, possibly.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n279\n00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.290\n&gt;&gt; Who's updating documentation?\n\n280\n00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.950\nHow's it modifing our infastructure?\n\n281\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.780\nDoes that modification to infastructure\nhave underlying changes that\n\n282\n00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.160\nkind of can propagate?\n\n283\n00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.640\nWe can kind of have this\ncascade effect where you go,\n\n284\n00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.090\nI just made this small change, but it\ncould bring down a large set of services.\n\n285\n00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:49.240\nAnd it seems simple, but\nif you don't do things like this, and\n\n286\n00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:54.610\nyou don't have repeatable,\nreproducible or even considered\n\n287\n00:17:54.610 --> 00:18:00.250\nkind of changes or just, for\nlack of a better word, configuration.\n\n288\n00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:04.690\nI don't know, I've worked in a place where\nthey were like, you just make tha change,\n\n289\n00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:06.530\neverybody's got their hands in everything.\n\n290\n00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.817\nAnd it was an absolute nightmare.\n\n291\n00:18:08.817 --> 00:18:11.952\nThere was no request,\nthere was no documentation.\n\n292\n00:18:11.952 --> 00:18:14.541\nAnd they just go,\nwhy's this running here now?\n\n293\n00:18:14.541 --> 00:18:15.979\nAnd somebody goes, [SOUND].\n\n294\n00:18:15.979 --> 00:18:21.350\nAnd then things go down and there's\nno way to determine what caused it.\n\n295\n00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.750\nWas it something that just happened?\n\n296\n00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.300\nWas it something that we did?\n\n297\n00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.870\nHow do we now bring the services back\nonline that were preexisting there because\n\n298\n00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.190\npeople are kind of just poking at them?\n\n299\n00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:34.730\nI strongly, strongly advocate for\n\n300\n00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:38.286\nthis system.\n&gt;&gt; Well the other thing, and just to touch\n\n301\n00:18:38.286 --> 00:18:42.763\non something that you mentioned\nthere about a service has a failure,\n\n302\n00:18:42.763 --> 00:18:47.394\nif you don't have anywhere where you\nhave got all of your configuration\n\n303\n00:18:47.394 --> 00:18:51.513\nitems stored, where you've got\ninformation about your CIs.\n\n304\n00:18:51.513 --> 00:18:54.690\nThen quite often, you cannot get\nto the root cause of a problem.\n\n305\n00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:59.600\nYou cannot find out what it is that's\nfailing, because if we don't have\n\n306\n00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.030\nthat huge picture of all\nof our infrastructure,\n\n307\n00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:09.830\nthen it's generally the thing that you\ncan't find is the thing that's failed.\n\n308\n00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.310\nThat's always the way it works, right,\n\n309\n00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.490\nbecause otherwise you would\nhave found it straight away.\n\n310\n00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.010\nSo configuration management is important.\n\n311\n00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:20.195\nAnd in ITIL when we refer to configuration\nmanagement, we refer to it as\n\n312\n00:19:20.195 --> 00:19:24.242\nthe foundation for everything else,\nfor all of our other services,\n\n313\n00:19:24.242 --> 00:19:28.540\nthis is your single source of accurate and\nreliable information.\n\n314\n00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:33.190\nAnd this is where you should go and it's\nimportant that this is kept up to date.\n\n315\n00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:37.790\nSo that when you want any information,\nthis is where you go out.\n\n316\n00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:42.400\nAnd all of our other services all\nof our other databases then update\n\n317\n00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.730\nthis configuration management system.\n\n318\n00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.525\nAs they get outdated we should have\ndynamic relationships in place.\n\n319\n00:19:48.525 --> 00:19:51.320\nAnd in fact just a little while\nago I mentioned about dynamic\n\n320\n00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.420\nrelationships between our data sources.\n\n321\n00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:58.080\nAnd that's incredibly important to help\nwith maintaining the integrity of this.\n\n322\n00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.300\nBut yes, you're right.\n\n323\n00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:04.110\nWhether you are in a SIAM ecosystem or\nin an ITIL environment,\n\n324\n00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:08.190\nthe fact of the matter is that\nwithout this, you do have chaos.\n\n325\n00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:12.100\nWhen it comes to changes, incidents,\nproblems, you're going to have chaos and\n\n326\n00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.100\nyou're going to find it very difficult\nto control your environment.\n\n327\n00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:19.380\nSo even outside of this SIAM ecosystem,\nit makes sense.\n\n328\n00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:25.860\nHowever, that's not to be too blase\nabout the amount of effort and\n\n329\n00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:31.030\nthe complexity of configuration\nmanagement in a SIAM ecosystem.\n\n330\n00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.890\nSo the things that you\nneed to be considerate of\n\n331\n00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:37.010\nare the relationships\nbetween your data sources.\n\n332\n00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:41.120\nAnd, of course, we've talked in previous\nepisodes about data sources and\n\n333\n00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.400\nwho owns the data.\n\n334\n00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.857\nIt's on your network, so\nare you owning that data or\n\n335\n00:20:45.857 --> 00:20:48.224\nis your supplier owning that data?\n\n336\n00:20:48.224 --> 00:20:51.721\nAnd bearing in mind that suppliers\nwill need to talk to each other\n\n337\n00:20:51.721 --> 00:20:56.194\nbecause these relationships may be between\ncomponents that have been supplied by\n\n338\n00:20:56.194 --> 00:20:58.640\ndifferent service providers.\n\n339\n00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.290\nSo I don't wanna be blase about this,\n\n340\n00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:04.370\nI want to stress the importance\nof configuration management, but\n\n341\n00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.950\nI also want to stress the complexity\nof configuration management.\n\n342\n00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.730\nAnd the fact that it's not something\nthat we can just simply gloss over and\n\n343\n00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.050\njust assume that we can\nget it in place and\n\n344\n00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:19.010\nit can be there tomorrow because\nit's gonna take some planning.\n\n345\n00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:23.790\nAnd you cannot just enter into\nconfiguration management with just\n\n346\n00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.430\na simple statement to say,\nhey, guess what,\n\n347\n00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.340\nwe're doing configuration management.\n\n348\n00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.300\nWe've got to plan this out.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jo,\n\n349\n00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.770\nI actually have a question\nabout that complexity.\n\n350\n00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.810\nWould the aggregation of all of the,\nall right,\n\n351\n00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:38.570\na single service provider has made\na change, they wanna update documentation.\n\n352\n00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:43.520\nIs that, in and of itself,\na service about this update?\n\n353\n00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.620\nOr how would that work?\n\n354\n00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.370\nI'm just trying to imagine that I have\na lot of these service providers,\n\n355\n00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.660\nand they do have these disparate systems.\n\n356\n00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.125\nHow do I get this unified\nview of configuration and\n\n357\n00:21:53.125 --> 00:21:56.660\nconfiguration changes and all of that?.\n&gt;&gt; Your toolset's\n\n358\n00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:01.515\ngonna be incredibly important when it\ncomes to this, and the service management\n\n359\n00:22:01.515 --> 00:22:06.080\ntoolsets that are available nowadays are\ngonna help with this a huge great deal.\n\n360\n00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.590\nAnd most configuration management systems\nare, and it's the same with incident\n\n361\n00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:14.540\nmanagement and change management and\nrequests and problem management, etc.\n\n362\n00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:19.740\nMost service management tool systems,\nwe call them workflow process engines,\n\n363\n00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:25.750\nwill have the ability to communicate\nwith other workflow process engines.\n\n364\n00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:30.880\nAnd most now have that compatibility\nthat they can share data sources.\n\n365\n00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.810\nAnd so even though it's complex and\nyou have to think about the relationships,\n\n366\n00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:39.970\nnevertheless, we have the tools available.\n\n367\n00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:43.330\nIt's not as difficult as it sounds,\nbut it's gotta be planned out.\n\n368\n00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.090\nAnd there's got to be a lot of agreement.\n\n369\n00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.710\nAnd, again, this comes back into\nservice level management and\n\n370\n00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:53.320\ncontract management as well, because there\nhas to be agreement over data ownership.\n\n371\n00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.160\nBut there also has to be\nagreement over things like,\n\n372\n00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.880\nif my records state on my\nconfiguration management system that\n\n373\n00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.960\nyou've got a 500 gig hard drive,\nbut yet the records\n\n374\n00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.300\nof the supplier state that that's a 1\nterabyte hard drive, then what is it?\n\n375\n00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.010\nWhose is the accurate one?\n\n376\n00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:14.520\nWhere do we get that\naccurate information from?\n\n377\n00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.080\nDo we get the accurate information\nfrom network detection tools or\n\n378\n00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.460\ndo we get the accurate information by\naccepting what the supplier tells us?\n\n379\n00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:27.780\nThose sort of things are the anomalies\nthat have got to be worked out.\n\n380\n00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.160\nThese are the policies\nthat you've got to decide\n\n381\n00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.910\nbefore we get into\npopulating the database.\n\n382\n00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:40.039\nYou've got to decide how you're going\nto structure it and where you're gonna\n\n383\n00:23:40.039 --> 00:23:43.336\nget your information, your data from.\n&gt;&gt; Well Jo,\n\n384\n00:23:43.336 --> 00:23:47.688\nas someone who has worked in\na more chaotic environment before,\n\n385\n00:23:47.688 --> 00:23:53.167\nI will say reconciliation of differences\nof records have never crossed my mind,\n\n386\n00:23:53.167 --> 00:23:56.730\nand that can definitely be\na little more difficult.\n\n387\n00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.260\nNow, we've been talking about\nconfiguration management, but\n\n388\n00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.560\nwe are not done with SIAM\nprocesses in general.\n\n389\n00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.720\nAm I correct, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not, no, definitely not.\n\n390\n00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.210\nWhen we come back in our future epiodes,\nwe've got a lot more to cover.\n\n391\n00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.770\nWe're going to look at portfolio and\ncatalog management.\n\n392\n00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:12.700\nWe're going to look at toolsets.\n\n393\n00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.690\nWe've a lot more to cover when\nit comes to SIAM processes.\n\n394\n00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.950\n&gt;&gt; If you're as excited as I am,\n\n395\n00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:19.780\nthen definitely join us on back.\n\n396\n00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:23.440\nWe will be here bringing more\nSIAM processes right at you.\n\n397\n00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.190\nBut for now we're going to go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n398\n00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:28.140\nSo signing out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n399\n00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:28.960\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n400\n00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.091\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n401\n00:24:31.091 --> 00:24:37.116\n[MUSIC]\n\n402\n00:24:37.116 --> 00:24:40.439\nThank you for watching

00:00:06.169\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:08.345\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:10.540\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.920\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone, and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.110\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and\n\n8\n00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.070\nwe're coming back at you\nwith more SIAM processes.\n\n9\n00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.693\nIn particular,\nwe're gonna be looking at SPM and SCM.\n\n10\n00:00:23.693 --> 00:00:26.973\nAnd I'm pretty sure I got those\ntwo acronyms, but were bound and\n\n11\n00:00:26.973 --> 00:00:28.260\ndetermined to find out.\n\n12\n00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.417\nAnd I have someone in studio who will\ntell us all about it, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n13\n00:00:31.417 --> 00:00:32.230\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n\n14\n00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.780\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Justin.\n\n15\n00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.600\nHow are you?\n\n16\n00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.150\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic as well.\n\n17\n00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.720\nAnd well, I said a couple of three-letter\nacronyms there and I think, before we go\n\n18\n00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.910\nany further, let's just make sure we're\nall on the same page with those acronyms.\n\n19\n00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.030\n&gt;&gt; Well, were gonna be looking at the\nprocesses of service portfolio management,\n\n20\n00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.930\nand service catalog management\nin this particular episode.\n\n21\n00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.310\nThere are some people that\nwill assume that portfolio and\n\n22\n00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.100\ncatalog are exactly the same,\nand they're not.\n\n23\n00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.943\nThe relationship is that\nservice catalog management, or\n\n24\n00:01:04.943 --> 00:01:09.803\nthe service catalog itself,\nis actually part of the service portfolio.\n\n25\n00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:14.210\nBut we're gonna go into that in a little\nbit more depth in a little while.\n\n26\n00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.630\nBecause, obviously,\nyou're in this particular episode,\n\n27\n00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.110\nwe're gonna be talking about both of them.\n\n28\n00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.872\nSo service portfolio management then well,\nbefore we start and\n\n29\n00:01:22.872 --> 00:01:26.077\nlook at the purpose of\nservice portfolio management,\n\n30\n00:01:26.077 --> 00:01:30.690\nI couldn't get my teeth in there Justin,\nwhat on earth is wrong with me today?\n\n31\n00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.011\n[LAUGH] So I want us to think about\ncomplexity of the SIAM ecosystem just for\n\n32\n00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:40.950\na moment, and let's think about\nthe structure that we have.\n\n33\n00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.290\nAnd of course,\nas we already know by now and\n\n34\n00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.520\nwe've seen in all of our\nprevious episodes as well.\n\n35\n00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.916\nThe SIAM ecosystem, well,\nit consists of a service integrator layer,\n\n36\n00:01:49.916 --> 00:01:52.230\nwe've also got our customer up here.\n\n37\n00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.455\nAnd we've got our individual service\nproviders at the bottom layer.\n\n38\n00:01:57.455 --> 00:02:01.970\nThey may have some sub service providers,\nor sub contractors in there as well.\n\n39\n00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.020\nSo service portfolio management, well,\nwe all know what a portfolio is, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.990\nYou understand the use\nof the word portfolio.\n\n41\n00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.398\nSo a portfolio is,\nwell it's a list, isn't it?\n\n42\n00:02:14.398 --> 00:02:18.630\nIt's an offering of our services.\n\n43\n00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.450\nSo where do you think this sits, then?\n\n44\n00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.790\nOn what sort of layer do you think\nthe service portfolio should sit?\n\n45\n00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.991\nIs it at customer layer or-\n&gt;&gt; I would say it's in the service\n\n46\n00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:33.859\nintegrator layer, because it's like\na representative body of work of\n\n47\n00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.630\nall the services that we have access to.\n\n48\n00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.640\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes and no, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.325\nYou're right, what you were\nreferring to is a service catalog.\n\n50\n00:02:45.325 --> 00:02:48.050\nWhich is part of the service portfolio.\n\n51\n00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.630\nLet's think of portfolio as, I like\nto think of it as the catalogue, but\n\n52\n00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.750\nwith bells and whistles attached.\n\n53\n00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.485\nActually, it's a lot more\nthan service catalogue.\n\n54\n00:02:58.485 --> 00:03:01.350\nSo let's think about what it is?\n\n55\n00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.385\nSo if we think of a catalogue,\nin it's traditional term,\n\n56\n00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:10.598\ndo you do any online shopping?\n\n57\n00:03:10.598 --> 00:03:13.990\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't like going\nout of my house so absolutely.\n\n58\n00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.720\n&gt;&gt; There's a reason why we don't like\nJustin at our house to be honest.\n\n59\n00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.070\nBut anyway, [LAUGH] Online shopping.\n\n60\n00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.590\nYou go online, and\nyou look up the catalog.\n\n61\n00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.550\nAnd that catalog is a list of services\nthat are available for you to buy.\n\n62\n00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.644\nAt some point in time, whoever that\nretailer is has had an idea that they want\n\n63\n00:03:34.644 --> 00:03:40.118\nto, let's say we're talking about, what's\nthe thing that you buy most often, Justin?\n\n64\n00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:40.898\n&gt;&gt; Probably, dog food.\n&gt;&gt; I don't\n\n65\n00:03:40.898 --> 00:03:42.539\nknow whether I wannna ask actually, right?\n\n66\n00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:43.650\n&gt;&gt; I'm wanna go with dog food.\n\n67\n00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.349\n&gt;&gt; You gonna go with dog food-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n68\n00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.623\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's say then that,\n\n69\n00:03:47.623 --> 00:03:53.190\nthat retailer has decided that they want\nto introduce a new brand of dog food.\n\n70\n00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.675\nWell, of course, they're going to\nevaluate that dog food first before they\n\n71\n00:03:57.675 --> 00:04:00.373\nstart to sell it,\nwell you'd like to hope so.\n\n72\n00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:04.495\nYou just certainly don't want the dog\ngetting sick of the dog food because\n\n73\n00:04:04.495 --> 00:04:08.500\nnobody's evaluated it, so\nI'd expect it to be tested.\n\n74\n00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.880\nSo when it goes through all\nthat testing it's going to be\n\n75\n00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.300\nat that retailer's website,\nor at the retailer's site.\n\n76\n00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.280\nI'd expect there to be some database\nwith all of the information about\n\n77\n00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.340\nthat dog food on there.\n\n78\n00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.950\nThe one that they're evaluating, right?\n\n79\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's when you get\nnew things in the catalog.\n\n80\n00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.760\nYeah, hopefully,\nit has been appropriately vetted.\n\n81\n00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.260\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n82\n00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.600\nSo if we're going to\nbring in new offering to\n\n83\n00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.370\noffer to our customers, we wanna approve\nit before it goes into the catalog.\n\n84\n00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.970\nSo you're gonna keep all of the\ninformation about the evaluation etcetera,\n\n85\n00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.630\nin a database.\n\n86\n00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.380\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\n87\n00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.425\nThen to have that information\nin a separate database, and\n\n88\n00:04:54.425 --> 00:04:59.707\nthen once we've evaluated we then move\nthat information into the catalog,\n\n89\n00:04:59.707 --> 00:05:04.432\nor does it make sense to have that\ninformation just in one database.\n\n90\n00:05:04.432 --> 00:05:09.220\nAnd then, once we've completed the\nevaluation we just simply tick a box to\n\n91\n00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.813\nsay make this visible to the customers.\n\n92\n00:05:11.813 --> 00:05:15.480\n&gt;&gt; I wanna go with that second option\nbecause it sounds the easiest to me.\n\n93\n00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.510\n&gt;&gt; Why?\nIt does sound the easiest.\n\n94\n00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.240\nAnd you know what?\n\n95\n00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.440\nIt is the easiest and\nthis is the most efficient as well.\n\n96\n00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.530\nSo actually,\nwe call that the service portfolio.\n\n97\n00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.620\nAnd the catalog is simply just\nthe portion of the portfolio.\n\n98\n00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.390\nBut it's a portion of the portfolio\nthat is visible to the customers.\n\n99\n00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.358\nAnd exactly as Justin said,\n\n100\n00:05:38.358 --> 00:05:43.697\nthat's what we go to when we want to buy\nthe dog food, you go to the catalogue.\n\n101\n00:05:43.697 --> 00:05:48.850\nBut what you don't realize is, that all of\nthe items in the catalogue have a life.\n\n102\n00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.730\nAnd they start off as an idea\nthat somebody wants to bring in.\n\n103\n00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.420\nAnd then,\nwe record that idea in the database.\n\n104\n00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.940\nAnd then we build on that idea, and\nwe build on we evaluate, we test, etc.\n\n105\n00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.930\nWe work our distribution.\n\n106\n00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.110\nWill work out the cost.\n\n107\n00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.874\nAnd then, once we are assured\nthat the supplier can meet our\n\n108\n00:06:11.874 --> 00:06:16.842\nrequirements in terms of delivery and\nin terms of the volume.\n\n109\n00:06:16.842 --> 00:06:19.003\nThen we make it visible\nto our customers and\n\n110\n00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:21.250\nwe start to sell that particular dog food.\n\n111\n00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.390\nAnd eventually, the supplier's gonna\ntell us that they no longer produce that\n\n112\n00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.520\nparticular brand of dog food,\nor that particular flavor.\n\n113\n00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.580\nAnd when they do,\n\n114\n00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:36.010\nthen we simply transition that\nparticular item into a retired.\n\n115\n00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.200\nSo in other words, once we're out of stock\nthen it's probably marked as out of stock\n\n116\n00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.333\nand then we retire it.\n\n117\n00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:45.540\nAnd we eventually,\nwe'll remove it from the catalog.\n\n118\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.790\nBut we don't actually\nremove it from the catalog.\n\n119\n00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.682\nWhat we do is we just untick the box that\nsays, it's visible to the customers.\n\n120\n00:06:54.682 --> 00:06:56.570\nSo we're still in the same database.\n\n121\n00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.610\nSo we've got record of the fact that we\nused to supply that particular type of\n\n122\n00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:01.160\ndog food.\n\n123\n00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.260\nAnd we've also got record of the fact.\n\n124\n00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.500\nThat it's been disconnected, and\n\n125\n00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.990\nthe reason that it's been,\nor not disconnected.\n\n126\n00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.920\nBut it's been stopped, and\nthe reason why it's been stopped, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.697\nSo this is our portfolio.\n\n128\n00:07:15.697 --> 00:07:20.656\nOur portfolio is a catalog,\nbut it's a catalog with well,\n\n129\n00:07:20.656 --> 00:07:24.630\nbells and whistles on, as I've said.\n\n130\n00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.910\nBecause the portfolio is the database\nwhere we store all of the information\n\n131\n00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:34.020\nabout the entire life of that\nparticular product in that case.\n\n132\n00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.260\nSo we have,\nin our portfolio we have our pipeline.\n\n133\n00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.498\nWhich is where we do all our evaluation.\n\n134\n00:07:41.498 --> 00:07:45.910\nThen we have our catalog, which is\nthe bit that's visible to the customers.\n\n135\n00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.270\nAnd then, we have the retired section.\n\n136\n00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.830\nNow, let's think about\nthis in terms of IT.\n\n137\n00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.227\nSo in IT, all of our services, and\n\n138\n00:07:54.227 --> 00:07:58.714\nI'm thinking about my service\nintegrator level at the moment.\n\n139\n00:07:58.714 --> 00:08:02.726\nSo in IT, all of my services Well,\nthey're going to,\n\n140\n00:08:02.726 --> 00:08:06.120\nwe're going to have an idea first of all.\n\n141\n00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.810\nAnd we're gong to put that\nidea into our pipeline and\n\n142\n00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.140\nthen we're going to evaluate that idea.\n\n143\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.020\nAnd there are things that\nhappen in previous episodes,\n\n144\n00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.300\nlike business cases that needed\nto be approved for instance.\n\n145\n00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.890\nAnd then development work\nthat needed to happen.\n\n146\n00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.550\nAnd then once we have\nan anticipated release date for\n\n147\n00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.700\nthat particular service\nthen it becomes visible.\n\n148\n00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.460\nAnd it therefore becomes part of our\ncatalogue, and then once that service is\n\n149\n00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:37.500\nreached it's end-of-life then\nwe just simply untick the box.\n\n150\n00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.840\nWe simply then say,\nokay it's no longer live,\n\n151\n00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.180\nthis is the date that it's gonna be\nretired on and it's no longer available.\n\n152\n00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.730\nAnd it becomes part of our\nretired services section.\n\n153\n00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:53.230\nSo if we take a look at the purpose\nof service portfolio management,\n\n154\n00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:58.720\nyou'll see that that purpose is to\nmaintain information on all services,\n\n155\n00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:06.340\nincluding future investment as well\nas those services that have retired.\n\n156\n00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.720\nAnd that's it, that is the purpose\nof service portfolio management.\n\n157\n00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.920\nSo let's consider this in\na little bit more depth then.\n\n158\n00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.310\nSo let's think about that\nactual pipeline itself.\n\n159\n00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:23.210\nAnd that pipeline is, well,\nthis is where we store those ideas.\n\n160\n00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:29.340\nWhen we've got those initial ideas\nthat have come from the business.\n\n161\n00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.500\nThere is a process that brings\nthose ideas in from the business.\n\n162\n00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.370\nAnd I wonder if Justin can\nremember what that process is?\n\n163\n00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.160\n&gt;&gt; Joe, you killing me.\n\n164\n00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.700\nI was thinking about an analogy for\nthe portfolio in the catalogue and\n\n165\n00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.690\nyou caught me off guard.\n\n166\n00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:50.730\nSo, the process that brings\nthose into the business.\n\n167\n00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.750\nHmm, I'm gonna go with,\nwait for it, wait for\n\n168\n00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:59.295\nit, Total loss, you got me Jo, bravo.\n\n169\n00:09:59.295 --> 00:10:03.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\nMakes you feel good, doesn't it?\n\n170\n00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.500\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It does, it, I mean,\n\n171\n00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.900\nit makes me not feel good.\n\n172\n00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.150\nBut that's all right.\n\n173\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\nI feel great right now, right?\n\n174\n00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.440\nNo, it's business relationship management.\n\n175\n00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.260\nDo you remember business\nrelationship management?\n\n176\n00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.965\nWe had that process that's responsible for\n\n177\n00:10:16.965 --> 00:10:21.181\nthe relationship with the organization,\nyeah?\n\n178\n00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:25.412\nAnd this was quite a few episodes ago now,\nand if you need any refresher on business\n\n179\n00:10:25.412 --> 00:10:29.584\nrelationship management then I suggest you\ngo back and watch the episode where we\n\n180\n00:10:29.584 --> 00:10:33.040\nlooked a little bit closer at\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n181\n00:10:35.005 --> 00:10:40.660\nBRM should be mainly, well I'm looking for\nBRM to be predominately proactive.\n\n182\n00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:45.680\nI'm looking for BRM to come up with ideas\nbased on what the service integration,\n\n183\n00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.570\nwhat the service providers can actually\ndeliver us as service for our customers.\n\n184\n00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.510\nSo BRM comes up with the ideas.\n\n185\n00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.610\nAnd those ideas go into our pipeline.\n\n186\n00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.370\nAnd it's our pipeline where\nwe store the ideas for\n\n187\n00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.060\nour new services to be\ndelivered to the organization.\n\n188\n00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.750\nAnd then those ideas evolve.\n\n189\n00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.080\nThose ideas when were evaluateed.\n\n190\n00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.319\nSo your service portfolio\nis a decision making,\n\n191\n00:11:12.319 --> 00:11:16.433\nit's a support tool really for\nthe decision making process.\n\n192\n00:11:16.433 --> 00:11:21.146\nBecause this is where we store our\nevaluation information into that\n\n193\n00:11:21.146 --> 00:11:22.930\nportfolio.\n\n194\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:28.790\nAnd then once that is approved,\nonce the business case has been approved.\n\n195\n00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:33.090\nAnd the business has decided that\nthis is a service that they want to\n\n196\n00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:37.100\ninvest in because it will,\nit will require some investment.\n\n197\n00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.880\nAnd then at that point in time then we\nknow that we will start a project and that\n\n198\n00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:47.780\nwill be a project to design and then build\nand test and then implement that service.\n\n199\n00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.730\nAnd that service, then,\n\n200\n00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:53.870\nmoves into the service catalogue once\nit's available to our customers.\n\n201\n00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:57.740\nSo once we have a release date, we want\nto make it visible to our customers.\n\n202\n00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.520\nAnd then, of course, at some point in\ntime, business relationship management and\n\n203\n00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.235\nservice portfolio management,\n\n204\n00:12:04.235 --> 00:12:08.280\nwe will make a decision that\na service is no longer viable.\n\n205\n00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.510\nAnd we're gonna have a lot of processes\nthat are gonna be involved in that.\n\n206\n00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:16.850\nAnd that will include continual service\nimprovement that will be assessing for\n\n207\n00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:19.280\nrelevance against\nthe business requirements.\n\n208\n00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.650\nBusiness relationship management, again,\nwhich will, because they sit in that\n\n209\n00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.240\ncustomer environment,\nthen business relationship management will\n\n210\n00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:32.640\ntake ownership of identifying when the\nbusiness is no longer using that service.\n\n211\n00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.300\nAnd then of course,\nservice catalog management or\n\n212\n00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.960\nservice portfolio management.\n\n213\n00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:42.280\nWell, again we're evaluating\nwhat we've got in our catalog.\n\n214\n00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.510\nAnd if ever we see any duplications,\nif ever we see a service that's simply\n\n215\n00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:51.090\nunderutilized or not used,\nthen that will need to prompt\n\n216\n00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:56.960\na discussion with BRM as to, well,\nwhy do we need this particular service?\n\n217\n00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.770\nSo, that's service portfolio management.\n\n218\n00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.210\nWe've looked at how we\nget a service in there.\n\n219\n00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:10.222\nBut now we need to look at what we\nkeep in that particular database.\n\n220\n00:13:10.222 --> 00:13:11.408\nAnd let's think about our portfolio and\nour service catalogue.\n\n221\n00:13:11.408 --> 00:13:19.400\nAnd let's think about our\nonline shopping experience.\n\n222\n00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.670\nWhat do you think we keep in our\nservice catalogue and in our portfolio?\n\n223\n00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:28.610\nProbably the most on-demand services\nare the ones that provide the most value\n\n224\n00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.720\nto the respective businesses.\n\n225\n00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.302\n&gt;&gt; Well, in our catalogue,\neverything should be listed.\n\n226\n00:13:34.302 --> 00:13:36.395\n&gt;&gt; All right, so our service portfolio or\n\n227\n00:13:36.395 --> 00:13:39.890\nalso the queue of things that\nare being vetted that may be hidden.\n\n228\n00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.800\n&gt;&gt; Think about it as your ideas.\n\n229\n00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.850\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n230\n00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:43.700\n&gt;&gt; So these are your ideas.\n\n231\n00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.450\nThey've not quite yet been approved.\n\n232\n00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.250\nThey haven't had that\nbusiness case approval, so\n\n233\n00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.420\nwe just got ideas in that pipeline.\n\n234\n00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.600\nAnd then once the idea's approved,\nthen it moves into the catalogue,\n\n235\n00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.560\nand then we make a decision as to\nwhether we're going to make it visible.\n\n236\n00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.930\nSo everything should be in the catalogue.\n\n237\n00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:05.110\nWhere you were getting a little bit caught\nup was the visibility to the customer.\n\n238\n00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay so\n\n239\n00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.680\nthere are things in the in the catalog\nthat are not visible to the customer?\n\n240\n00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.280\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n241\n00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:15.780\n&gt;&gt; But they have been approved from\nthat idea stage as an available service.\n\n242\n00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.120\n&gt;&gt; Right and so they'll be in\nthe catalog and there may be things that\n\n243\n00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.930\nour design team are working on,\nthat our development team are working on.\n\n244\n00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.760\nBut they realized that they get so\nfar down a project and\n\n245\n00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.540\nrealize that actually this\nis not a viable service.\n\n246\n00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:34.985\nWe can't do this, or maybe a key supplier\nis no longer one of our suppliers for,\n\n247\n00:14:34.985 --> 00:14:37.140\nif things change, let's face it.\n\n248\n00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:42.070\nAnd so in that instance then we may\nnever make that particular service\n\n249\n00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.115\nvisible to the customers.\n\n250\n00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.430\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's, wait.\n\n251\n00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:47.900\nWe were getting some clarity there.\n\n252\n00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.400\nLet's go back to your original question,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n253\n00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.210\nWhat was your original question?\n\n254\n00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:57.060\n&gt;&gt; What do you expect to find in\nyour portfolio on your catalog?\n\n255\n00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.270\nWhat sort of information do\nyou expect to find in there?\n\n256\n00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:05.390\n&gt;&gt; What the service is capable of,\nI think I'm having trouble,\n\n257\n00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.240\nlike figuring out what\nexactly your asking Jo.\n\n258\n00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.230\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so when you take\na look at your online shopping.\n\n259\n00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:13.640\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n260\n00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.560\n&gt;&gt; You expect to see probably a photo\nof what it is that your buying.\n\n261\n00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.020\nOkay, so\nwe're talking about the service here.\n\n262\n00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.000\nSo your probably not going to see a photo,\nbut you might see some screen shots.\n\n263\n00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.090\nBut the one thing that you always see no\nmatter what it is that you're buying,\n\n264\n00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:29.740\nyou will see a description.\n\n265\n00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.320\nSo we're gonna have in our\ncatalog a service description.\n\n266\n00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.410\nThis in terms of value that\nit provides to the customer.\n\n267\n00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.685\nSo this service will do X, Y, and Z.\n\n268\n00:15:44.496 --> 00:15:47.190\nWe found that description somewhere else,\ndidn't we?\n\n269\n00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.728\nIn fact,\nwe formed that description somewhere else.\n\n270\n00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:54.538\nWhere was it?\n\n271\n00:15:54.538 --> 00:15:58.892\n&gt;&gt; We're getting to the hard part,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n272\n00:15:58.892 --> 00:16:01.221\nWhere did we form that description?\n\n273\n00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:04.626\nAll right, so if I go back and\nI think about portfolio,\n\n274\n00:16:04.626 --> 00:16:08.640\nwould that description be from\nthe business relation manager?\n\n275\n00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.290\n&gt;&gt; No, I want to turn\nthe clock back two episodes.\n\n276\n00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay, two episodes.\n\n277\n00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.441\n&gt;&gt; Just the two.\n\n278\n00:16:18.706 --> 00:16:23.020\nAnd I want to, all right,\nI will rephrase my question.\n\n279\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:23.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n280\n00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.080\n&gt;&gt; Where did we agree\nthe service description?\n\n281\n00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:34.020\n&gt;&gt; During our service level agreements?\n\n282\n00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:34.930\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n283\n00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.860\n&gt;&gt; And during, well,\nin our respective contracts,\n\n284\n00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.510\ndepending on whether-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n285\n00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:40.860\n&gt;&gt; It's internal or external.\n\n286\n00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.190\n&gt;&gt; So that's the same description that\nyou'd find in your service catalog.\n\n287\n00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.770\nAnd the other thing that you'd find,\nwhen I say what else would appear in your\n\n288\n00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.400\nservice catalog,\neverything that's in the SLA.\n\n289\n00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.130\nJust think about it.\n\n290\n00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.450\nThe hours of availability, for instance.\n\n291\n00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:57.970\nWho to contact when you have\nan incident or when you have a problem.\n\n292\n00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.470\nWho to contact when you\nwant to make changes.\n\n293\n00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.580\nThat's what I expect to\nsee in my service catalog.\n\n294\n00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:07.900\nSo you could even think of your\nservice catalog as having a view\n\n295\n00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.520\ninto that service level agreement.\n\n296\n00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right,\nthis is starting to make sense.\n\n297\n00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:17.330\nSo it's kind of like a snapshot of here\nare the things that are available to\n\n298\n00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:21.510\nyou from the service level agreements,\nor the contracts, respectively.\n\n299\n00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.440\nWhat value does it provide?\n\n300\n00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.390\nWhen is it available?\n\n301\n00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.190\nWho should I contact?\n\n302\n00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:29.550\nWould it also have agreements\non if there is an incident,\n\n303\n00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:33.400\nwhat are the service level targets for\nrestoration and service?\n\n304\n00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.380\nOr would that be a little too much detail?\n\n305\n00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.190\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but, and I'm glad you said that,\nactually, about a little too much detail,\n\n306\n00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:40.965\nyou've gotta be careful when you catalog.\n\n307\n00:17:40.965 --> 00:17:42.810\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n308\n00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:48.190\nYou have to have a way of\nidentifying information that is\n\n309\n00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:53.370\nuseful to the customers and useful to your\nend users, but not too much information.\n\n310\n00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.892\nThey don't need to find everything out.\n\n311\n00:17:54.892 --> 00:17:59.440\nFor instance, do you really, really\nwant your end users, your customers,\n\n312\n00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:05.850\nknowing, identifying, and contacting\nmaybe external service providers?\n\n313\n00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.970\nBecause they may not get the response\nfrom an external service provider as\n\n314\n00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.640\nthey would from the service desk.\n\n315\n00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.080\nSo you have to think about the information\nthat's in your service catalog and\n\n316\n00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.180\nthink about whether that's relevant and\n\n317\n00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.960\nwhether that is actually\nvaluable to your end users.\n\n318\n00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.900\nYou will probably have more than\none view of your service catalog.\n\n319\n00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.910\nYou'll have a view from the service\nintegrated perspective.\n\n320\n00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.260\nYou'll have a view from\nthe customer perspective.\n\n321\n00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:35.880\nAnd from each individual service\nprovider in your ecosystem, they may\n\n322\n00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:40.480\nalso have their own separate individual\nview of the service catalogue as well.\n\n323\n00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.720\nOf course,\nthink about the complexity as well,\n\n324\n00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.390\nbecause you've got all these individual\nservice providers in that ecosystem.\n\n325\n00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.860\nSo they will all be contributing.\n\n326\n00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.600\nWe saw this in a previous episode.\n\n327\n00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.940\nThey'll all be contributing different\ncomponents to each individual's service.\n\n328\n00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:02.260\nSo your portfolio, whilst it contains\nyour ideas and your retired services,\n\n329\n00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:07.070\nit also contains your catalog, which is\nwhat is there to the customer's to see.\n\n330\n00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.010\nIt's what they can purchase.\n\n331\n00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.670\nAnd of course, you've also got\ncharging information in there\n\n332\n00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:15.410\nif we're gonna charge the customer\nseparately for any particular item,\n\n333\n00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.470\nlike for a new a laptop for instance.\n\n334\n00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:23.395\n&gt;&gt; That was actually my other question,\njust like our online shopping example.\n\n335\n00:19:23.395 --> 00:19:26.350\nWould this contain broad cost perspective?\n\n336\n00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.380\nOr would this give me detail?\n\n337\n00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:32.140\nOr would that ultimately be defined as\nis this the service integrator view or\n\n338\n00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.630\nis this the customer view?\n\n339\n00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.720\nOr am I getting too\ndeep in the weeds here?\n\n340\n00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.200\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't mind getting\ndeep in the weeds at all.\n\n341\n00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.860\nIn fact, I quite like this,\nbecause these are the comments and\n\n342\n00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.770\nthese are the conversations that we\ngenerally have when we're on site.\n\n343\n00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:50.510\nBecause this is what our\ncustomers are asking.\n\n344\n00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.443\nWhat do I want to see?\n\n345\n00:19:52.443 --> 00:19:55.891\nThink about what is relevant\nto your customer and\n\n346\n00:19:55.891 --> 00:19:59.320\nyour customer group and your user groups.\n\n347\n00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.662\nSo we're gonna use things like\nMicrosoft Active Directory, etc.\n\n348\n00:20:02.662 --> 00:20:07.290\nWe're gonna use directory services tools\nto manage access into the catalog.\n\n349\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:11.040\nAnd it is perfectly feasible that every\nsingle user group may have a different\n\n350\n00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.010\nview on the catalog.\n\n351\n00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:18.760\nIn exactly the same way that most\nweb sites will use IP addressing to\n\n352\n00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.920\nsee where you are, location services,\nand then route you to the appropriate,\n\n353\n00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:31.620\nmaybe country, website of any particular,\nespecially international organization.\n\n354\n00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:36.865\nAnd so, in that same token, we're\ngonna use a profile, etc., to do that.\n\n355\n00:20:36.865 --> 00:20:40.990\nSo different people will have access\nto different amounts of information.\n\n356\n00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:45.790\nSo it may well be that the users\nwould have access to, and\n\n357\n00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:50.290\nthis depends on your policies, by the way,\ncompletely depend on the policies.\n\n358\n00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:53.660\nGiven that we've got a customer layer,\nwe've got the service integrator layer,\n\n359\n00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.220\nwhich may be internal or external, and\n\n360\n00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.850\nthen we go to individual\nservice providers.\n\n361\n00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.860\nDependent on your charging policies,\n\n362\n00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:07.432\nyou may want service provider may\ncharge say $1,000 for a laptop.\n\n363\n00:21:07.432 --> 00:21:10.710\nBut then the service integrator\nthen has to build that laptop.\n\n364\n00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.460\nThey have to put a build on it and\nthey have to distribute it.\n\n365\n00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:20.233\nSo the cost is $1,000, but\nthe charge to the customer is $1,500.\n\n366\n00:21:20.233 --> 00:21:24.223\nAnd therefore,\nthe cost to the customer is $1,500.\n\n367\n00:21:24.223 --> 00:21:28.660\nNow, you might want your\ncustomers seeing all of that, or\n\n368\n00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:32.430\nyou might just want your customer\nseeing the $1,500, which is their cost.\n\n369\n00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.070\nThat's easy, that's for a laptop.\n\n370\n00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:41.130\nBut then, when it comes to,\nlet's say, e-mail service,\n\n371\n00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:46.240\nwell, we might charge for\na specific license.\n\n372\n00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.130\nBut then, if we charge just for\nthe license,\n\n373\n00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:53.140\nlet's go back to our\nconfiguration management episode,\n\n374\n00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:57.870\nwhich is our previous episode, and then\nlook at the components of our service.\n\n375\n00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.720\nSo charging for\na license is just charging for\n\n376\n00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.130\nthe software for that particular service.\n\n377\n00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:06.460\nBut hang on a minute,\nyou need to have hardware, and\n\n378\n00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:10.310\nyou also need to have power, and you need\nto have people, and you need to have\n\n379\n00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:14.030\na network contract in order to be\nable to send or receive e-mail.\n\n380\n00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:19.230\nSo if you only charge for\nthat one license fee, how are you\n\n381\n00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:22.990\ngoing to recoup your costs for all of the\nother components that you used as well?\n\n382\n00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:28.660\nSo you may choose to\ncharge on a cost basis.\n\n383\n00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.290\nYou may choose to charge\non a cost plus basis.\n\n384\n00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:35.120\nYou may choose just to charge\na nominal fee per user.\n\n385\n00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.020\nOr you may choose not to\ncharge anything at all,\n\n386\n00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:42.220\nand it just becomes part of the budget\nthat comes in from the customer.\n\n387\n00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:46.350\nIt depends on so many factors,\nthere is no right or wrong.\n\n388\n00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:48.890\nBut whether the service\nintegrator is internal or\n\n389\n00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:53.290\nexternal, who your service providers are,\nagain, whether they're internal or\n\n390\n00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:56.690\nexternal, what agreements you have\nwith your service provider, and\n\n391\n00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:00.830\nalso what you want to add in to\nthose specific cost as well.\n\n392\n00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:04.730\nSo now that I've completely blown your\nmind, does that answer your question?\n\n393\n00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:05.890\n&gt;&gt; That does answer my question, but\n\n394\n00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:09.530\nI can see that there could be\na lot of nuanced decisions here.\n\n395\n00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:11.690\nI was just thinking\nbefore you even said it,\n\n396\n00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.110\nis this our internal service integrator,\nor is it an external one?\n\n397\n00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:20.850\nThe hybrid one, I see this being,\na whole bunch of shenanigans.\n\n398\n00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:25.240\nAnd then, I think it also gets a little\nweird is if the service integrator, right?\n\n399\n00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:29.441\nYou see this cost, but\nthere's some service integrator, for\n\n400\n00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:33.890\nlack of a better word, margin, or\nadditional cost on top of that.\n\n401\n00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.854\nI would think it would get weird if\nthe internal service provider is like\n\n402\n00:23:36.854 --> 00:23:39.530\nit only cost us $1,000\nto provide this service.\n\n403\n00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.340\nBut then, what the customer sees\nis $1,500, and they're like,\n\n404\n00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.950\nwell, wait a minute.\n\n405\n00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.598\nThis was an internal service for\nus, why is there additional costs?\n\n406\n00:23:46.598 --> 00:23:51.742\nBecause there are management, and upkeep,\nand all of these other things that are,\n\n407\n00:23:51.742 --> 00:23:54.801\nfor lack of a better word,\nintangible, I guess.\n\n408\n00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:55.703\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n409\n00:23:55.703 --> 00:23:57.093\n&gt;&gt; I'll take that, yeah.\n\n410\n00:23:57.093 --> 00:24:02.960\nThen are unforeseen or\nmaybe hidden I don't know the best word.\n\n411\n00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.090\n&gt;&gt; Right, I like the word hidden, but\n\n412\n00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:11.000\nthink about the total cost of ownership,\nthe TCO as we like to say.\n\n413\n00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.250\nAnd you have to think about the,\nI'm not gonna say intangible,\n\n414\n00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:22.650\nbecause they are tangible, some of them\nare hidden, but some of them are variable.\n\n415\n00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:29.890\nSo, let's say, for instance your internet\nservice provider, it's not hidden\n\n416\n00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:35.600\ncost there's a definite cost to that it\nmay be variable, but it may be fixed.\n\n417\n00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.610\nWhat generally happens is we've got\na portion of that particular bill that's\n\n418\n00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:42.190\nfixed, and\nthe other part of that bill is variable so\n\n419\n00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:45.030\nhow do we incorporate that\ninto the cost of a laptop.\n\n420\n00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:49.110\nBecause the one thing that we do not\ndo is put a bill on an end user's\n\n421\n00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.360\ndesk every single month to say,\nby the way there's your bill for\n\n422\n00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.930\nyour internet service provider and\nhere's another bill for\n\n423\n00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:58.450\nthe electricity that you've used\nat this particular desk and\n\n424\n00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:03.810\nhere's another bill for clean of\nthe office that you sat in right now.\n\n425\n00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:08.570\nSo we don't do that, so what we will\nchoose to do ordinarily is we will\n\n426\n00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:15.520\nactually charge a fixed cost to the user\nthat will encompass absolutely everything.\n\n427\n00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.950\nNow, we did have an episode where we\ntouched on financial management and\n\n428\n00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:24.510\nthese are all of the questions that we\nwould look at in financial management,\n\n429\n00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:27.090\nis the how we would look at the costs.\n\n430\n00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:32.780\nIs to how we would have portioned\nthose costs whether we have\n\n431\n00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:37.860\ndirect apportionment where we simply take\nthe number of users and take our costs and\n\n432\n00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:43.800\nthen we can transfer some costs\ndirectly to a particular customer unit.\n\n433\n00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:49.420\nOr whether we have indirect costs\nthat are attributed to many different\n\n434\n00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:53.950\ncustomer units and many different business\nunits within the organization and,\n\n435\n00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.520\ntherefore, we have to apportion them.\n\n436\n00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.450\nGenerally, in a way where we look at\nthe number of people and we say, right,\n\n437\n00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:04.210\nI'm gonna divide this particular bill\nby a thousand people and then it\n\n438\n00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:07.590\ngoes back to whether you're running your\nservice integrator as a cost center or\n\n439\n00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:10.090\nas a profit center also.\n\n440\n00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:15.290\nAnd that will entirely depend on,\nwell, not necessarily entirely,\n\n441\n00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:19.090\nbut an element to that dependency will\nbe on whether they're internal or\n\n442\n00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:20.150\nwhether they're external.\n\n443\n00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:24.240\nBecause an external service integrator,\nwill almost certainly be a profit center,\n\n444\n00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.900\nthey will want to turn a profit as well.\n\n445\n00:26:27.726 --> 00:26:30.060\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what-\n&gt;&gt; I see steam, I see steam-\n\n446\n00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.010\n&gt;&gt; There are so many decisions to be made,\n\n447\n00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:36.430\nbut that does bring to light with some of\nthese variable costs, utilities right?\n\n448\n00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:37.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Whether it be Internet service\n\n449\n00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:42.130\nprovider, electricity, heat, whatever it\nmay be those can have a variable cost and\n\n450\n00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:46.010\nit would be really hard to break\ndown per user as you said.\n\n451\n00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:48.720\nWhereas specific\nprovisioning of software or\n\n452\n00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.970\nsoftware licences or hardware,\nthat's a little easier to say,\n\n453\n00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:58.110\nhere is what it will cost with\na fair amount of certainty per user.\n\n454\n00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.670\nWhereas and I wanna make sure I have this,\nwith variable cost you go,\n\n455\n00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:05.560\nI have this kind of cushion and I'm gonna\nsay, all right you have a thousand users,\n\n456\n00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.980\nhere's your grand total bill.\n\n457\n00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:12.460\nSo, here's the cost per user and we wanna\nmake sure that it still divvyed out but\n\n458\n00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.780\nstill covers all of\nthe respective cost involved.\n\n459\n00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:19.493\n&gt;&gt; It's really complex and this is why\nI said we've got financial management,\n\n460\n00:27:19.493 --> 00:27:23.264\nthe financial management as\na process is a complex process and\n\n461\n00:27:23.264 --> 00:27:26.091\nit's one where we'll\nwork out all of these and\n\n462\n00:27:26.091 --> 00:27:29.809\nthey will work it out based on\nwhat's good for the business.\n\n463\n00:27:29.809 --> 00:27:34.305\nAnd we have to think about\nalso the service integrators,\n\n464\n00:27:34.305 --> 00:27:39.553\nif they're internal or\nif they're external service integrators\n\n465\n00:27:39.553 --> 00:27:45.563\nthat will have a huge big important part\nto play in how costs are calculated.\n\n466\n00:27:45.563 --> 00:27:50.462\nBut also, where the costs are even\nmade visible to the business units and\n\n467\n00:27:50.462 --> 00:27:52.980\nto the customers themselves.\n\n468\n00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:57.560\nWith an internal service integrator,\nthe customers generally don't see a cost\n\n469\n00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.080\nthat's a general rule, that's not\na hard and fast rule, by the way.\n\n470\n00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.360\nBut with an internal service integrator,\n\n471\n00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.990\nwe don't usually publish\nthose costs to the customer.\n\n472\n00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:10.930\nWith an external service integrator\nthough, the customer is generally very\n\n473\n00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.890\naware of the cost because\nthey're cost conscious and\n\n474\n00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:18.200\nthey wanna make sure they get the best\nvalue for money that they can.\n\n475\n00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:23.440\nSo there is no right or wrong, it's\njust incredibly difficult to work out.\n\n476\n00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.180\nAnd then of course,\nthe service integrator, if they are just\n\n477\n00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:32.760\na pass through of costs, in other words,\nthe money that comes through\n\n478\n00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.190\nfrom the business is then used to pay\nall of the individual service providers.\n\n479\n00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:40.360\nThen we've got to be very very\ngood with our budgeting for\n\n480\n00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.610\nour service providers understanding\nexactly how much money\n\n481\n00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:48.180\nthey're going to need over\nthe course of a year for instance.\n\n482\n00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:54.830\nSo, it’s a real complex thing to\nactually calculate, which is why\n\n483\n00:28:54.830 --> 00:29:00.000\nwe have a process that does essentially\nthat a serve portfolio management.\n\n484\n00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.090\nWell a service portfolio and\n\n485\n00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:06.700\nmanagement just makes the decision as to\nwhat to publish in terms of costs and\n\n486\n00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.520\nwhat not to publish based on our\nfinancial management policies.\n\n487\n00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:14.300\n&gt;&gt; Well Joe, you've definitely tried\nto sum up something that well,\n\n488\n00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.260\nis a little more complicated\nthan I originally thought it was\n\n489\n00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:22.140\ngoing to especially since I put portfolio\nand catalogue the old switcheroo, right.\n\n490\n00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.852\nSo, now Jo we've made it far into\nour sign in process as journey, but\n\n491\n00:29:25.852 --> 00:29:28.330\nour journey is not over yet, is it?\n\n492\n00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:32.110\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not, did you expect it to be\nor you just wanna get out of here quickly?\n\n493\n00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:33.900\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm not saying I\nwant to get out of here,\n\n494\n00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.980\nI just wanna know how much more of\nthe mountain do we have to climb but\n\n495\n00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.820\nyou heard it straight from Jo, we still-\n&gt;&gt; I think we're on the downhill slope.\n\n496\n00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:46.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we're on the downhill slope, but\nwell we haven't made it to the end so\n\n497\n00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.630\nyou should definitely come on back.\n\n498\n00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:49.470\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here so\n\n499\n00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:52.450\nsigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n500\n00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:53.328\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n501\n00:29:53.328 --> 00:29:58.550\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n502\n00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:00.620\n[MUSIC]\n\n503\n00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:05.256\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:12.909\n&gt;&gt; Greetings, everyone,\n\n5\n00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:15.645\nand welcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:19.020\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison and\nwe're coming back at you with the Part 2.\n\n7\n00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.710\nWe're taking a look at how SIAM and\nITIL kinda co-mingle and\n\n8\n00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.270\nwell, this is part of\nour little miniseries.\n\n9\n00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.250\nWe're gonna be taking a look\nat some other frameworks and\n\n10\n00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.870\nhow SIAM works along with them.\n\n11\n00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.150\nAnd here to help us along\nis Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.320\nHow you doing today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you,\n\n13\n00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.870\nJustin, how are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n14\n00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.110\nAnd as I said at the end of Part one,\n\n15\n00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.640\nif you haven't seen that\ndefinitely go check it out.\n\n16\n00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.700\nWe kinda take a little overview,\nhave some discussion points As we\n\n17\n00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.260\nstarted the series, I thought, ITIL and\nSIAM were mutually exclusive things, but\n\n18\n00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.830\nI got the feeling it's not the case and\nwell,\n\n19\n00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.400\nwe're gonna dive a little bit further\ninto, well those two respective concepts.\n\n20\n00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.770\nRight, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; We are.\n\n21\n00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.660\nYeah, we are.\n\n22\n00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.140\nSo, for those of you that haven't actually\nwatched any of our ITIL episodes or\n\n23\n00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.090\nthat haven't seen our last episode,\nthen please do check out the last episode.\n\n24\n00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.460\nPlease do check out the ITIL\nfoundation episodes or series as well.\n\n25\n00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.410\nThat ITIL foundation is going to help you\ncertainly to achieve your SIAM foundation.\n\n26\n00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.090\nIt's not necessarily prerequisite to your\nSIAM foundation, but I will say that it is\n\n27\n00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.320\ncertainly going to help you, because\nyou do need to have an understanding of\n\n28\n00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.930\nthe processes that exist within\nany service management framework.\n\n29\n00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.630\nSo what I'm gonna do now\nin this particular episode.\n\n30\n00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.190\nIn our last episode we looked at\nthe synergy between ITIL and between SIAM.\n\n31\n00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.610\nAnd we looked at the history and\nthe fact that we expect any SIAM\n\n32\n00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.120\necosystem to have evolved\nfrom the ITIL framework.\n\n33\n00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.160\nAnd we expect you to still be using.\n\n34\n00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.126\nElements of the ITIL framework and\n\n35\n00:01:58.126 --> 00:02:01.531\ncertainly the ITIL processes\nwithin your SIAM ecosystem.\n\n36\n00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:06.870\nBut what you have to do is you have\nto ensure that you augment and\n\n37\n00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.223\nyou grow your ITIL processes in\norder to ensure that they fit.\n\n38\n00:02:12.223 --> 00:02:15.620\nAnd they are fit for\npurpose for the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n39\n00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.580\nSo in this particular episode,\nwe are going to take a very, very,\n\n40\n00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.770\nvery quick overviewing each of the five\nlife cycles, the ITIL life cycles.\n\n41\n00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.530\nWe're just gonna dip into\nthose life cycle stages, and\n\n42\n00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.490\njust go through the processes,\nand just look at how we make\n\n43\n00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.820\nthose processes work with\nus in that SIAM ecosystem.\n\n44\n00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.740\nSo look at how we can evolve\nwith those processes.\n\n45\n00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.520\nSo of course, we start off, as always with\nITIL, we start off with service strategy.\n\n46\n00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.640\nAnd if we just take a look at the screen\nin front of us, and by the way,\n\n47\n00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.770\nyou know that all of these materials\nare available for you to download.\n\n48\n00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.390\nSo, please feel free.\n\n49\n00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.360\nThere's much more material available for\n\n50\n00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.250\nyou to download then there is actually\ncoming up on the screen in front of you.\n\n51\n00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.650\nSo please feel free to\ndownload all of this and\n\n52\n00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.250\ntake a look at the information\nthat we've got available.\n\n53\n00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.830\nSo look at service strategy.\n\n54\n00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.060\nIf you remember, in service strategy for\n\n55\n00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.490\nITIL, this is where we come up with\nour ideas for our new service.\n\n56\n00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.850\nSo in service strategy, we have processes\nsuch as business relationship management.\n\n57\n00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.940\nWe have financial management,\nwe have service portfolio management.\n\n58\n00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.950\nAnd we also have strategy management,\nwhere we come up with our strategy for\n\n59\n00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.100\nIT, and demand management.\n\n60\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.380\nSo, the accountability for\nthese processes, for\n\n61\n00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.800\nthose five service strategy processes.\n\n62\n00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.289\nThat's something that we give to\nthe service integrator but the service\n\n63\n00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:48.673\nproviders underpinning those, they're\nresponsible for the supporting outcomes.\n\n64\n00:03:48.673 --> 00:03:53.199\nThey're responsible for the components\nof the service but never the less\n\n65\n00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:58.280\ndecisions are made between the service\nintegrator and the customer level.\n\n66\n00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.720\nThen of course, the decision made well,\nbased on the strategy,\n\n67\n00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.610\nthose strategy decisions.\n\n68\n00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.130\nSo, responsibility for\nsome of these processes\n\n69\n00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.250\ncould be shared between the customer and\nthe service integrator.\n\n70\n00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.380\nSo if you bear in mind that process is\nas we've talked about like financial\n\n71\n00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.810\nmanagement, etc., well,\nthe customer is paying the bill.\n\n72\n00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.310\nAnd so the customer is going\nto be making the decisions.\n\n73\n00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.930\nBusiness relationship management come\nout with ideas with new services\n\n74\n00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.340\nalong with service portfolio management\nand the customer is going to be making\n\n75\n00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.550\nthe decisions, so service strategy,\nmore than any other life cycle phase,\n\n76\n00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.880\nis probably going to be shared between the\nservice integrator and the customer layer.\n\n77\n00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.310\nAnd expect the customer to direct, and\n\n78\n00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.410\nthe service integrator to\nmanage those processes.\n\n79\n00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.750\nIf the service integrator is internal,\nthen\n\n80\n00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.560\nmore responsibility would quite naturally\nbe given to the service integrator.\n\n81\n00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.020\nBut where the service integrator\nis external and outside of.\n\n82\n00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.880\nThat the organization,\n\n83\n00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.400\nthen the decision making is going\nto sustain within the customer.\n\n84\n00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.560\nThat's very very important\nrelationship to consider when you\n\n85\n00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.310\nare implementing the SIAMICO system\nis who's going to make decisions.\n\n86\n00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.760\nAre you paying your service\nintegrated to make decisions on your\n\n87\n00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.820\nbehalf if they are external.\n\n88\n00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.520\nSo, that's something that's\ndefinitely got to be decided\n\n89\n00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.110\nbefore we move to the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n90\n00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.130\nAnd then, there's service design.\n\n91\n00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.220\nIf you remember,\nwe have eight processes in service design.\n\n92\n00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.240\nWe have the design coordination process,\n\n93\n00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.720\nwhich is almost a project\nmanagement style process.\n\n94\n00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.830\nAnd then we have service level management,\nand supplier management, and\n\n95\n00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.330\nservice Catalog management and\n\n96\n00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.110\nthen we also have a [INAUDIBLE] what\nwe called a warranty processes and\n\n97\n00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.010\na four warranty processes\nare the availability management process,\n\n98\n00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.720\nwe have capacity management, we also\nhave service continuity management,\n\n99\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.370\nand we have IT security management and\n\n100\n00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.790\nall of those are service design processes\nAnd our service design processes.\n\n101\n00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:17.400\nWell again, they're managed at\nthe service integrator level.\n\n102\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.190\nSo as it says in that\nsecond bullet point there,\n\n103\n00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.490\nthe service integrator is accountable for\nthe service design processes.\n\n104\n00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.690\nAnd for directing and coordinating\nall of those design activities.\n\n105\n00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:36.480\nThe sort of design activities that\nyou would expect to see in a project.\n\n106\n00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.370\nBut also the design activities\nthat you would expect\n\n107\n00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.070\nto see when it comes to managing\nthose service providers.\n\n108\n00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.830\nSuch as service level management and\nservice catalog management.\n\n109\n00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.850\nSo again, service providers are gonna be\nresponsible for delivering an outcome.\n\n110\n00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:58.080\nHowever, it's actually the service\nintegrator that is accountable.\n\n111\n00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.755\nRemember Justin we talked in a previous\nepisode about ray C, do you remember?\n\n112\n00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:06.080\nResponsible, accountable, C is-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n113\n00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.260\n&gt;&gt; Consults?\n\n114\n00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.320\n&gt;&gt; That's it, consulted.\n\n115\n00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.780\n&gt;&gt; And then I is informed.\n\n116\n00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.750\n&gt;&gt; Informed, right so\n\n117\n00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:18.680\nthink about the roles and responsibilities\nwhen it comes to all of these processes.\n\n118\n00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.110\nWho's gonna be accountable,\nwho's gonna own the process?\n\n119\n00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.010\nAnd who's going to be responsible.\n\n120\n00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.700\nAnd invariably,\nwhat we've talked about are decisions and\n\n121\n00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.290\nwe've talked about coordination,\nand therefore,\n\n122\n00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:35.080\nthe accountability would lie in service\ndesign with the service integrator,\n\n123\n00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.030\nbut the responsibility for individual\ntasks with each service provider.\n\n124\n00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.770\nAnd the same can be said for\nservice transition.\n\n125\n00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:47.940\nNow if you remember we have seven\nprocesses and service transition in ITIL.\n\n126\n00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:53.300\nWe have transition planning and support\nwhich is a project management type roll,\n\n127\n00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.750\nand then we have change management,\nwe have release and deployment management,\n\n128\n00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:02.210\nwe also have change evaluation and\nwe have service validation and testing.\n\n129\n00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.870\nWe have configuration management or\nservice asset and\n\n130\n00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.570\nconfiguration management\nas we call it in ITIL.\n\n131\n00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.051\nAnd then we have knowledge\nmanagement as well.\n\n132\n00:08:10.051 --> 00:08:15.037\nThat this are all processes that\nwe have looked at from a SIAM\n\n133\n00:08:15.037 --> 00:08:18.141\nperspective in previous episodes.\n\n134\n00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:23.061\nAnd so in the SIAM ecosystem then,\nwe still have these processes but\n\n135\n00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:26.012\nwe have to consider who is accountable.\n\n136\n00:08:26.012 --> 00:08:31.793\nSuch as the service integrator is\naccountable for deploying the service.\n\n137\n00:08:31.793 --> 00:08:37.231\nBut the individual responsibilities\nto do with the build and the test and\n\n138\n00:08:37.231 --> 00:08:43.042\nthe deployment of individual services and\nindividual service components.\n\n139\n00:08:43.042 --> 00:08:46.898\nWell, the service providers\nare gonna be responsible for\n\n140\n00:08:46.898 --> 00:08:49.470\ntheir particular activities.\n\n141\n00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.830\nThe accountability lies with\nthe service integrator.\n\n142\n00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.650\nIt kind of sounds familiar, right?\n\n143\n00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.660\nWe've got this now throughout design and\ntransition.\n\n144\n00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.920\nBut remember in service strategy,\nthe customer maintains a lot of\n\n145\n00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.838\naccountability because\nit's decision-making.\n\n146\n00:09:04.838 --> 00:09:09.340\nAnd it's decision-making on behalf\nof the financial expenditure and\n\n147\n00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:14.580\nalso decision-making on terms of\nwhat the customer wants to see.\n\n148\n00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.570\nSo accountability, it's strategy,\nin those strategic decisions,\n\n149\n00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.410\nlies up there with the customer.\n\n150\n00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:24.740\nBut accountability for\nservice delivery, for the build and\n\n151\n00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.620\ntest and implementation, well,\nthat lies with the service integrator.\n\n152\n00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.820\nAnd then let's take a look\nat service operation.\n\n153\n00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:39.870\nAnd again service operation,\nwell the service integrator again is\n\n154\n00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:45.740\naccountable for ensuring that that\nhappens in our business as usual.\n\n155\n00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.060\nOperation is maintaining the status quo,\nso\n\n156\n00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.190\nwe have five processes\nin service operation.\n\n157\n00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:57.150\nWe have Incident management, which is\nabout restoring normal service operation.\n\n158\n00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.620\nWe have a problem management which is,\n\n159\n00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.390\ncan you remember a problem management is?\n&gt;&gt; Finding\n\n160\n00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.540\nwhat cause the disruption of service.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\n\n161\n00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.140\nroot causes excellent, see?\n\n162\n00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.270\nI'm impressed, Justin.\n\n163\n00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.670\nI am,\nthis face is just full of admiration.\n\n164\n00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.360\n&gt;&gt; Well, I tell you,\n\n165\n00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.900\nJo, it might look like it's,\nthis face is sometimes looked like it's\n\n166\n00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.870\nskewed with confusion\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n167\n00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:20.650\n&gt;&gt; But a lot of times,\n\n168\n00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:25.310\nit's just me trying to like wrangle these\nideas and I have come a long way but\n\n169\n00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.960\nI still got a little further to go.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n170\n00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.730\nthat's what I expect all of\nyou to be able to do as well.\n\n171\n00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:36.830\nIt's a case if sometimes I like to think\nof some of these seriesas a jigsaw puzzle.\n\n172\n00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.370\nAnd you've simply just got to put\nthe right pieces in the right place.\n\n173\n00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.410\nSo we've got incident and\nproblem management in operation.\n\n174\n00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.000\nWe also have request fulfillment or\n\n175\n00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.680\nyou might want to call it request\nmanagement in SIAM, I don't mind.\n\n176\n00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.280\nBut it's request fulfillment it's about,\ncan I have something?\n\n177\n00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.170\nOr can you tell me something?\n\n178\n00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.980\nAnd then we also have\naccess management two.\n\n179\n00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:03.580\nAnd access management two is gonna have\naccess to something or taking access away.\n\n180\n00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.860\nSo the new start is then\nleave these processes.\n\n181\n00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.370\nAnd then of course,\nlet's not forget event management.\n\n182\n00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:13.880\nAnd event management is that process\nthat I expect to be automated\n\n183\n00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.280\nwhere we are monitoring event's something,\ndoing something about it.\n\n184\n00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.060\nEvent management in our ITIL is\nthe ability to detect events,\n\n185\n00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.570\nmake sense of them and\nthen determine appropriate control action.\n\n186\n00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:30.920\nSo with automating this,\nI should hope we're automating this.\n\n187\n00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:37.400\nAnd so, in SIAM again, in this ecosystem\nwe may well be given responsibility for\n\n188\n00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:42.030\nindividual management of certain process,\nor\n\n189\n00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:46.690\ncertain activities within processes\nto our services providers.\n\n190\n00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:51.450\nBut nevertheless, the accountability,\nmaking sure it happens,\n\n191\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.289\nthat lies with the service integrator,\n\n192\n00:11:54.289 --> 00:11:58.642\nand then, lastly,\nwe have Continual Service Improvement.\n\n193\n00:11:58.642 --> 00:12:03.309\nAnd Continual Service Improvement,\nwe have to have, and\n\n194\n00:12:03.309 --> 00:12:08.165\nthat's, well, it's essential to ITIL,\nbut it's very,\n\n195\n00:12:08.165 --> 00:12:11.990\nwell, is there such\na thing as very essential?\n\n196\n00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.710\nCan we have very essential?\n&gt;&gt; I think let's,\n\n197\n00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.323\ndoes that mean it's essential [INAUDIBLE]?\n\n198\n00:12:16.323 --> 00:12:16.980\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n199\n00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.000\n&gt;&gt; That's not a word.\n\n200\n00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.740\nJust so we're clear.\n&gt;&gt; Well, and I didn't think very essential\n\n201\n00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.880\nreally fit to well with English either.\n&gt;&gt; It is essential greatly, I don't know.\n\n202\n00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.730\nIt is greatly essential.\n&gt;&gt; We need it, right?\n\n203\n00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.069\nWe need it.\n&gt;&gt; It is not an option, all right?\n\n204\n00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:34.630\nCSI, continual service improvement,\nis a must.\n\n205\n00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:39.090\nYou have to have CSI, we have to\nhave continual service improvement.\n\n206\n00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.260\nRemember what the difference\nbetween continual and\n\n207\n00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.790\ncontinuous is?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n208\n00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:43.750\nI'm gonna go with your metaphor,\n\n209\n00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.020\nall right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n210\n00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.610\n&gt;&gt; Continual and continuous.\n\n211\n00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:47.840\nContinual is walking,\n\n212\n00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.070\ncontinuous is wheels rolling.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n213\n00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.030\n&gt;&gt; We're going to the same place.\n\n214\n00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.480\n&gt;&gt; But wheel is rolling,\n\n215\n00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.110\nyou're like I'm going, I'm going.\n\n216\n00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.380\nThere's not a lot of-\n&gt;&gt; Measurement.\n\n217\n00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.870\n&gt;&gt; Ability to measure or reflect on like,\n\n218\n00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.620\nokay, I actually need to deviate.\n\n219\n00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.360\nBut if you're walking continual and\nyou go, okay, I took a step.\n\n220\n00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.640\nAm I still on the right direction or\n\n221\n00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.160\ndo I need to\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n222\n00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.620\n&gt;&gt; Kinda teeter a little bit.\n\n223\n00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, perfect, and\n\n224\n00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:15.350\nso, it's about iterative improvement.\n\n225\n00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.170\nIt's about one improvement\nafter another after another.\n\n226\n00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:23.140\nIt's about continually checking that we're\naligned to the needs of our customer.\n\n227\n00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.700\nAnd so,\nwe have to ensure that that happens.\n\n228\n00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.415\nEspecially in the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n229\n00:13:30.415 --> 00:13:34.540\nIn the SIAM ecosystem,\nthe service integrator has to\n\n230\n00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:40.460\nbe very alert and\nvery aware of the needs of the customer.\n\n231\n00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:46.940\nWe have to be continually adjusting our\ndirection to align with their needs.\n\n232\n00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.110\nWhether you're an internal service\nintegrator or whether you're an external\n\n233\n00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:54.590\nservice integrator we have to\nbe aligned with our customer.\n\n234\n00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:59.147\nAs a service integrator in a SIAM\necosystem if we are not aligned to our\n\n235\n00:13:59.147 --> 00:14:04.032\ncustomer then our customer will find\nsomebody else to do that role for us.\n\n236\n00:14:04.032 --> 00:14:08.503\nAnd it's not just about our own survival\nbut it's also about delivering value to\n\n237\n00:14:08.503 --> 00:14:11.343\nour customer an delivering\nvalue to the business.\n\n238\n00:14:11.343 --> 00:14:15.870\nAnd whether we're internal or external,\nthat's ultimately what we want to achieve.\n\n239\n00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:20.980\nAnd so, our service integrator\nrole is accountable for CSI.\n\n240\n00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:26.010\nIt's accountable for ensuring the business\nrelationship management goes back to\n\n241\n00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:32.290\nthe organization, and the CSI is involved\nin every single process that we have.\n\n242\n00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.828\nIt tells us on our second bullet point\nthat getting any organization to adopt\n\n243\n00:14:37.828 --> 00:14:40.443\nservice improvement is\ngonna be a challenge.\n\n244\n00:14:40.443 --> 00:14:44.984\nBut when you talk about multiple layers,\nwhen you talk about\n\n245\n00:14:44.984 --> 00:14:50.152\na service integrator, or\na multiple different service providers,\n\n246\n00:14:50.152 --> 00:14:54.089\nthat the complexity can\nseem a little bit daunting.\n\n247\n00:14:54.089 --> 00:14:58.862\nBut nevertheless,\nif our service providers don't allow us to\n\n248\n00:14:58.862 --> 00:15:03.014\nmaintain our competitive edge,\nas an organization.\n\n249\n00:15:03.014 --> 00:15:05.778\nIf our service providers hold us back,\n\n250\n00:15:05.778 --> 00:15:11.322\nmaybe it's because our contracts have\nbeen negotiated in an inflexible way.\n\n251\n00:15:11.322 --> 00:15:15.884\nOr maybe it's because our\nservice providers don't\n\n252\n00:15:15.884 --> 00:15:20.920\nhave the skills to be able to improve or\nchange.\n\n253\n00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:27.160\nWhatever the reason is, if we don't get\nthe management of this complexity right,\n\n254\n00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.960\nthen our organization will suffer.\n\n255\n00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:34.480\nThe business will suffer, we could\npotentially lose to our competitors or\n\n256\n00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:41.070\nmaybe we're just not as efficient with\nour use of our funding as we could be.\n\n257\n00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:44.681\nMaybe we can no longer adhere\nto certain regulations, or\n\n258\n00:15:44.681 --> 00:15:48.906\nmaybe we may lose certain\ncertifications like ISO 20,000.\n\n259\n00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:51.954\nAnd so it's incredibly important,\n\n260\n00:15:51.954 --> 00:15:57.654\nthat continual service improvement\nis not just a phrase that we use,\n\n261\n00:15:57.654 --> 00:16:03.422\nbut it is actually invaded into\nevery single life cycle phase.\n\n262\n00:16:03.422 --> 00:16:08.490\nAnd that is embedded into every process,\nand that is embedded into every service\n\n263\n00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:13.450\nprovider and every functional area,\nso ITIL itself\n\n264\n00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:19.690\nis not actually mutually\nexclusive from SIAM.\n\n265\n00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:23.640\nIn fact,\nit's not exclusive at all from SIAM.\n\n266\n00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:28.570\nAnd if you've been watching the previous\nepisodes on all of the processes, then\n\n267\n00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:35.070\nyou'll see that SIAM processes and ITIL\nprocesses They don't different at all.\n\n268\n00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.850\nSure, we've used some different words,\nand sure,\n\n269\n00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:41.900\nwe've looked at things from a different\nperspective, we've looked at, you know,\n\n270\n00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.760\nprocesses that are managed\nacross the ecosystem,\n\n271\n00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.290\nacross multiple service providers,\nbut they're not actually exclusive.\n\n272\n00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:55.057\nWhat they are is heavily intertwined And\n\n273\n00:16:55.057 --> 00:17:03.960\nSIAM ecosystem is generally built\non the basis of an ITIL foundation.\n\n274\n00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.550\nSo having that ideal foundation\nin place will definitely help\n\n275\n00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.744\nthe evolution to a SIAM Eco-system.\n\n276\n00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.150\nIf you wanna know more about ITIL,\n\n277\n00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:17.370\nplease feel free to take\na look at our other series.\n\n278\n00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:22.046\nWe've got plenty of series on ITIL right\naway through from ITIL foundation through\n\n279\n00:17:22.046 --> 00:17:23.300\nto ITIL master.\n\n280\n00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.960\nSo, take a look at those series.\n\n281\n00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.170\nTake a look at some of the episodes if\nthere are certain things that you want to\n\n282\n00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.660\nclear up on specific processes.\n\n283\n00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:37.920\nThen take a look through our course\nlibrary and you'll find specific processes\n\n284\n00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:43.180\nmentioned in our ITIL\nsort of library itself.\n\n285\n00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.850\nSo take a look over there if there's\nsomething you're not sure of.\n\n286\n00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.690\nBut certainly if you have any questions,\nthen please feel free to catch up with us\n\n287\n00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.010\nin the forum and\nwe'll help you with any of those.\n\n288\n00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:58.920\nIn our next episode,\nwe're going to explore more\n\n289\n00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.740\nthe relationship that SIAM has with other\nframeworks and with all the methodologies.\n\n290\n00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.130\nAnd then in our next episode,\nwe're going to look at something that is\n\n291\n00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:11.850\nheavily intertwined again with ITIL and\nwith SIAM.\n\n292\n00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.617\nAnd, that's ISO IEC 20,000.\n\n293\n00:18:14.617 --> 00:18:19.212\nAnd, yet again we do have if there's\nsomething that you want to cover,\n\n294\n00:18:19.212 --> 00:18:23.980\nwe do have an ISO 20,000 series\navailable on our course libraries.\n\n295\n00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.320\nSo, if you want to go away and\n\n296\n00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:31.280\ntake a look at that before you join us on\nthe next episode then Well I'll be quite\n\n297\n00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.620\nhappy to see you on the next episode.\n&gt;&gt; Well we'll definitely be\n\n298\n00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.800\nhappy to see you, you see it,\nyou come back later, who knows.\n\n299\n00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.310\nBut I think Jo you've really kinda\npin pointed the fact that this is\n\n300\n00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:47.570\nan evolutionary process,\nit's not a cut and dry process and to some\n\n301\n00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:51.710\nextent What I mean by cutting it dry is\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n302\n00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.460\nI'm concerned about the use of the word,\nprocess, cuz we use the word,\n\n303\n00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.480\nprocess, a lot when it\ncomes to methodologies.\n\n304\n00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.740\nAnd so I think probably what you mean,\nmaybe I'm trying not to put words in\n\n305\n00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.280\nyour mouth is that it's not a cut and\ndry Evolution or an implementation.\n\n306\n00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.540\nIs that what you mean?\n&gt;&gt; And that's what I mean and\n\n307\n00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.680\nI will tell you, if you've been watching\nany part of this series, you know I get\n\n308\n00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:16.700\ndinged with being kinda fast and loose\nwith my terminology because it's important\n\n309\n00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:22.270\nto have a similar working terminology\nwhen you're making discussions right?\n\n310\n00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:23.600\nAnd because-\n&gt;&gt; Common language.\n\n311\n00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.920\n&gt;&gt; A common language as\n\n312\n00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.480\n&gt;&gt; Just make sure you're\n\n313\n00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.580\nconsistent with them.\n\n314\n00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.150\nWell, speaking of being consistent,\nhopefully you can come on back as we can\n\n315\n00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:35.750\ncontinue on with out SIAM foundation and\nlooking at some of those other frameworks.\n\n316\n00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.630\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n317\n00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.280\nSigning of for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n318\n00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.210\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n319\n00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.904\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n320\n00:19:42.904 --> 00:19:48.843\n[MUSIC]\n\n321\n00:19:48.843 --> 00:19:53.176\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:12.937\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:12.937 --> 00:00:16.210\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.500\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and we're\ncontinuing on with SIAM Foundation, and,\n\n6\n00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.550\nwell, were just getting started, we're\nramping up here on our little mini series\n\n7\n00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.380\nhere, we're taking a look at SIAM and\nother frameworks.\n\n8\n00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.230\nAnd interestingly enough, we're gonna\nbe looking at ISO 20K in this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.073\nAnd, well, here to help us along is Ms.\n\n10\n00:00:33.073 --> 00:00:36.020\nJo Peacock, how are you doing today Jo?\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna help anybody unless we\n\n11\n00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.658\nget it right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:37.658 --> 00:00:41.824\n&gt;&gt; It's ISO stroke IEC 20000.\n\n13\n00:00:41.824 --> 00:00:44.663\n&gt;&gt; I made them promises that I'll get that\n\n14\n00:00:44.663 --> 00:00:48.527\nright but I'll try, I'll try, okay?\n&gt;&gt; It's okay,\n\n15\n00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:51.730\nwe commonly abbreviate to ISO 20K,\nthat's all right.\n\n16\n00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.760\nIt's not a problem.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n17\n00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.530\n&gt;&gt; But of course when it comes to\n\n18\n00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.290\nany official documentation or when it\ncomes to any audits and anything else,\n\n19\n00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.550\nthen obviously we've got\nto give it its full title.\n\n20\n00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.280\nSo in our downloadable material,\nwe're gonna give it its full title.\n\n21\n00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.570\nCertainly in our slides that we have,\nwe'll give it its full title.\n\n22\n00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.900\nBut if we wanna call it ISO 20K,\n\n23\n00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.540\ndo you know what, that's all right.\n&gt;&gt; I think Jo\n\n24\n00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.430\nthat's the first time that you've given\nme a little bit of latitude or leniency\n\n25\n00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.640\n&gt;&gt; so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n26\n00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.090\nmark this down on my calendar.\n\n27\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.070\nBut that's all right.\n\n28\n00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.110\nNow, before we get too concerned with\nhow ISO 20000 kind of integrates or\n\n29\n00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.740\nit's utilized in a SIAM ecosystem.\n\n30\n00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.790\nWhat is ISO 20000?\n\n31\n00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.620\nJust to make sure we're\nall on the same page here.\n\n32\n00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.326\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so,\n\n33\n00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:40.573\nwhat we're actually gonna do in this\nparticular episode is we're just\n\n34\n00:01:40.573 --> 00:01:45.545\ngonna explore ISO 20000,\nwe're going explore on ISO 27002 slightly.\n\n35\n00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:50.888\nAnd we're just gonna look at how that\nactually fits in with that SIAM ecosystem.\n\n36\n00:01:50.888 --> 00:01:52.002\nSo ISO 20000, and\n\n37\n00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:55.693\nin fact we do have a slide that will\njust show you a little bit of ISO 20000.\n\n38\n00:01:55.693 --> 00:01:59.734\nAnd I think what we need to do\nis blow this one up full screen.\n\n39\n00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:05.207\nPerfect, so you can see on the right\nhand side we have, in the blue,\n\n40\n00:02:05.207 --> 00:02:12.360\nin the middle, we have the, well,\nthis is the ISO 20000th standard.\n\n41\n00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.267\nThis is what we audit against.\n\n42\n00:02:16.075 --> 00:02:19.290\nWe're gonna come back to that in a second.\n\n43\n00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.760\nSo let's just, well, and\njust keep it up full screen.\n\n44\n00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.570\nLet's just introduce that a little bit,\nbut let's go.\n\n45\n00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.170\nWe're gonna come back\nto that in a second and\n\n46\n00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.580\nI'm gonna expand on it a little bit more.\n\n47\n00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.060\nBut an international standard is\nsomething that we can audit against.\n\n48\n00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.810\nISO 20000 is the international\nstandard for service management.\n\n49\n00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.900\nISO 27002 is the international\nstandard for IT security management.\n\n50\n00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:50.853\nAnd what would happen ordinarily is and an\nISO, an IEC auditor, somebody like myself,\n\n51\n00:02:50.853 --> 00:02:55.868\nwould come in into an organization and\nwould audit an organization,\n\n52\n00:02:55.868 --> 00:03:00.969\na service provider organization\nagainst the criteria that is there on\n\n53\n00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:06.950\nthe screen in that right-hand corner,\nthey're in the blue box predominantly.\n\n54\n00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.110\nNow if we do take a look at the blue\nbox that's on our screen there, and\n\n55\n00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.480\nyou can see that you have got what we call\na service management system in ISO 20000.\n\n56\n00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.970\nAnd what this is,\nis that these are our audit criteria and\n\n57\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.050\nit tells us that an organization has to\nhave this particular system in place.\n\n58\n00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.200\nAnd so it has to have processes for\nthe design and\n\n59\n00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.100\ntransition of your change services.\n\n60\n00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.600\nIt has to have what we call delivery\nprocesses such as capacity management and\n\n61\n00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.180\nservice level management and security\nmanagement and budgeting and accounting,\n\n62\n00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.760\nwhich sounds awfully like\nfinancial management to me.\n\n63\n00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.890\nIt has to have control processes,\nsuch as release and deployment and\n\n64\n00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.660\nchange and configuration.\n\n65\n00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.756\nAnd it has to have resolution processes\nlike incident and problem, and\n\n66\n00:03:55.756 --> 00:03:59.246\nrelationship processes like BRM and\nsupplier management.\n\n67\n00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:04.154\nSounds awfully similar to\nthose processes that we've\n\n68\n00:04:04.154 --> 00:04:09.391\ntalked about in previous\nepisodes in our SIAM ecosystem.\n\n69\n00:04:09.391 --> 00:04:12.191\nAnd also the processes\nthat we've talked about\n\n70\n00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:16.330\nwhen we looked at that episode that\nhad that ITIL integration as well.\n\n71\n00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.190\nAnd certainly when you look at ITIL,\nit sounds very,\n\n72\n00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.100\nvery similar to ITIL, doesn't it?\n\n73\n00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.510\nIt's not the same,\nit's not exactly the same as ITIL.\n\n74\n00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.790\nIt's an international standard\nthat measures an organisation for\n\n75\n00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.480\nits efficiency and\nits effectiveness in service management.\n\n76\n00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.780\nNow, I'll quite often get asked and\nI do get asked this.\n\n77\n00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.380\nSo if we implement ITIL then, naturally,\nwe would be able to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n78\n00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:53.690\nWell, let's start of with the first\nobvious mistake in that particular logic.\n\n79\n00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.350\nAnd that is the fact that\nyou don't implement ITIL.\n\n80\n00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.520\nYou can't implement ITIL,\nit's not plug and play,\n\n81\n00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.350\nit's not a one size fits all approach\nto successful service management.\n\n82\n00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.510\nITIL is a flexible framework,\nand as a flexible framework,\n\n83\n00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.501\nwe adopt it and\nwe adopt it to suit the needs\n\n84\n00:05:12.501 --> 00:05:16.838\nof the organization,\nthe service provider organization.\n\n85\n00:05:16.838 --> 00:05:22.338\nHowever, if we have an ITIL-based\nframework in place,\n\n86\n00:05:22.338 --> 00:05:26.921\nthat is at its optimum in\nterms of efficiency and\n\n87\n00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:32.649\neffectiveness, then it will\nstand us in very good stead for\n\n88\n00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:36.905\nachieving ISO 20000 certification.\n\n89\n00:05:38.754 --> 00:05:43.319\nISO 20000 certification allows\nan auditor to come into\n\n90\n00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:47.713\nthe organization and\nto check against certain criteria.\n\n91\n00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:53.006\nAnd we have what we call ISO 20000 part\n1 which is the must have criteria for\n\n92\n00:05:53.006 --> 00:05:54.194\nISO 20000.\n\n93\n00:05:54.194 --> 00:05:58.515\nAnd that is an organization must be\nable to demonstrate these processes,\n\n94\n00:05:58.515 --> 00:06:02.976\nthey must be able to demonstrate inputs\nand outputs from these processes and\n\n95\n00:06:02.976 --> 00:06:05.430\nrelationships between process as well.\n\n96\n00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.555\nAnd then we have a part 2,\nwhich is a guidance,\n\n97\n00:06:08.555 --> 00:06:12.720\na sort of a helpful hints and\ntips on how you can achieve this.\n\n98\n00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.743\nAnd, then an auditor will come in and\nwe'll audit your processes against\n\n99\n00:06:18.743 --> 00:06:25.180\nthe part 1 criteria, and also taking into\nconsideration some of the part 2 criteria.\n\n100\n00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.780\nAnd then should you be\nawarded your certification,\n\n101\n00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.900\nthen that's very simply a plaque\nthat you can display on the wall.\n\n102\n00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.380\nIt's something that you can\nsay within your organization,\n\n103\n00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.650\nwe have achieved this accreditation.\n\n104\n00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.410\nNow a lot of organizations will strive\nto achieve ISO 20000 based on the fact\n\n105\n00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.410\nthat you cannot and\nthere is no accreditation for ITIL.\n\n106\n00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.570\nYou cannot have a certificate that says,\nhey,\n\n107\n00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.540\nin this organization we have\nan ITIL-based framework.\n\n108\n00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.408\nWhat we can do is we can measure against\nan international standard which is where\n\n109\n00:07:02.408 --> 00:07:04.453\nISO 20000 comes into play.\n\n110\n00:07:04.453 --> 00:07:06.270\nOkay, all that's very good and\n\n111\n00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.915\nwe've given you a little bit\nof a background on ISO 20000.\n\n112\n00:07:09.915 --> 00:07:14.845\nAnd ISO 27002 does something very,\nvery similar but\n\n113\n00:07:14.845 --> 00:07:17.770\nfrom an IT security perspective.\n\n114\n00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.550\nBut what's that got to do\nwith the SIAM ecosystem then?\n\n115\n00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:28.030\nBecause the SIAM ecosystem\nis quite different from\n\n116\n00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:33.310\nthe ITIL based framework and\nfrom the ITIL based environment.\n\n117\n00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.870\nBecause the ITIL based environment,\nif you remember when we looked at previous\n\n118\n00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:42.240\nepisodes, we've explored the fact that\nin ITIL, we have a service provider,\n\n119\n00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:48.420\nand then we will have processes that\nexist within the service provider.\n\n120\n00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:55.155\nAnd so as such, from an ISO 20000\nperspective, it's relatively easy for\n\n121\n00:07:55.155 --> 00:08:00.081\nan auditor to come in and\nto then audit that organization,\n\n122\n00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:06.833\nthat service provider organisation Again,\nit's that particular standard.\n\n123\n00:08:06.833 --> 00:08:07.760\nLet's just think.\n\n124\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:16.160\nWould it be appropriate then for\nan ISO 20000 auditor to come in and\n\n125\n00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:22.330\nmeasure a SIAM-based ecosystem\nagainst that particular standard?\n\n126\n00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.120\nIf what we have to do is\nwe have to come in and\n\n127\n00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.310\nwe have to assess incident management.\n\n128\n00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.760\nAnd we have to assess all of those\nprocesses that we've just seen,\n\n129\n00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.280\nchange management, release and\n\n130\n00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.300\ndeployment management, problem management,\nconfiguration management.\n\n131\n00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:43.940\nHow do we actually assess all of those\nprocesses across the SIAM ecosystem?\n\n132\n00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.760\nBear in mind that the SIAM\necosystem consist of,\n\n133\n00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.240\nwell, not the customer necessarily because\nwe're not gonna award to the customer.\n\n134\n00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.344\nBut we've got service\nintegration layer and\n\n135\n00:08:53.344 --> 00:08:56.170\nthen we've got all of\nthose service providers.\n\n136\n00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:01.900\nSo how does an ISO 20000 all\nlater come in to that service\n\n137\n00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:07.080\nintegrator organization and then audit all\nof those processes when so much of those\n\n138\n00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:12.010\nprocesses is actually being delivered\nby all of those service providers?\n\n139\n00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:20.650\nSo not exactly something that is easy\nto attain our service integrator.\n\n140\n00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:24.450\nJustin's thinking.\n&gt;&gt; I have a couple of question actually.\n\n141\n00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:29.940\nSo, number one,\nwhat would be the plus of obtaining this\n\n142\n00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.880\ncertification or designation if you will?\n\n143\n00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.540\nAnd then, secondly, if that's the case,\n[INAUDIBLE] is not easy.\n\n144\n00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:42.590\nIf all of the service providers likely,\nwere all ISO 20000 designated,\n\n145\n00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:47.550\ndoes that indirectly make the other one\n\n146\n00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.480\nlike the service integrator\nISO 20000 designated?\n\n147\n00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.360\nOr is that just impossible?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n148\n00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.164\nyou have to know that obviously everybody\nis guessed by I am British, So I'm\n\n149\n00:10:00.164 --> 00:10:05.211\nnever go be one of these people who are\ngonna say hey that's a great idea Justin.\n\n150\n00:10:05.211 --> 00:10:09.332\n[LAUGH] Or that I'm gonna say that Justin\nabsolutely not, you're ridiculous?\n\n151\n00:10:09.332 --> 00:10:15.147\n[LAUGH] No, I understand how you got that\nbut unfortunately just because everybody\n\n152\n00:10:15.147 --> 00:10:21.590\nelse achieves ISO 20000 doesn't mean\nthat you are going to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n153\n00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.920\nIt's not that simple.\n\n154\n00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.810\nIt's actually really, really complex.\n\n155\n00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:32.510\nJust because your service providers have\nachieved it, doesn't mean that you can.\n\n156\n00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.328\nWhat does ISO 20000 give you?\n\n157\n00:10:35.328 --> 00:10:37.545\nIt gives you a certificate.\n\n158\n00:10:37.545 --> 00:10:40.070\nAnd you might say, well,\nwhy do I need the certificate?\n\n159\n00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:45.060\nWell, quite simply, if you want to\nundertake certain contracts with\n\n160\n00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:49.630\ncertain maybe government departments,\nor with certain organizations,\n\n161\n00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:55.130\nmaybe financial institutions, etc.,\nit's not beyond any organization\n\n162\n00:10:55.130 --> 00:11:00.150\nanywhere in the world to insist that its\nservice provider is ISO 2000 certified.\n\n163\n00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:07.511\nIt's not beyond that at all, and\nI've come across a lot of organizations\n\n164\n00:11:07.511 --> 00:11:12.311\nwhen they go on out and they're looking\nfor potential service providers,\n\n165\n00:11:12.311 --> 00:11:15.608\nthey will say, well,\nit's part of the criteria.\n\n166\n00:11:15.608 --> 00:11:21.220\nIt's part of that RFP, the demonstration,\nbut you've achieved a certain level.\n\n167\n00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.840\nAnd the reason why organizations ask for\nthat is because simply they want a surety\n\n168\n00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.240\nthat that service provider is going to\nbe working efficiently and effectively.\n\n169\n00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.940\nThey want that assurance.\n\n170\n00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.060\nThey want to know that when they give\ntheir money to a service provider,\n\n171\n00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.870\nit's not gonna be wasted and it's not\ngonna be wasted in unnecessary red tape.\n\n172\n00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.770\nAnd all of their money is going\nto go to ward service delivery.\n\n173\n00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:50.358\nSo in that instance,\nthen I say 20,000 is incredibly valuable.\n\n174\n00:11:50.358 --> 00:11:57.370\nI say 20,000, once you achieve it,\nit's not exactly easy to maintain.\n\n175\n00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.180\nBecause it's not just a one off thing,\nyou don't achieve it,\n\n176\n00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.620\nthen put a plaque on the wall, and then\nsay, hey, look that's it, we've got it.\n\n177\n00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.400\nYou achieve it,\nyou put a plaque on the wall, and\n\n178\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.560\nthen you have interim audits every year.\n\n179\n00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.100\nAnd then every three years you have\na full audit, and if you don't achieve,\n\n180\n00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.990\nif you don't pass your audit\nthen that certification,\n\n181\n00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.400\nthe accreditation is removed from you.\n\n182\n00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.630\nSo part of the challenge of ISO\n20000 is attaining ISO 20000.\n\n183\n00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:28.599\nAnother part of it is actually\nmaintaining ISO 20000 accreditation.\n\n184\n00:12:28.599 --> 00:12:31.287\nSo in the service integrator layer,\n\n185\n00:12:31.287 --> 00:12:36.837\nwe know that a lot of the processes\nthat exist there, well, that completely\n\n186\n00:12:36.837 --> 00:12:42.470\ndependent on the performance of\nthe individual service providers.\n\n187\n00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:46.130\nSome of those service providers\nmay have achieved the ISO 20000.\n\n188\n00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.962\nAnd they may work in one way and\n\n189\n00:12:47.962 --> 00:12:52.156\nthey may be able to demonstrate\nefficiency in their own practices.\n\n190\n00:12:52.156 --> 00:12:55.395\nBut then when it comes to\nthe relationships outside of their\n\n191\n00:12:55.395 --> 00:12:58.897\norganization, without the service\nprovider organizations,\n\n192\n00:12:58.897 --> 00:13:02.720\nthey may not be able to\ndemonstrate that efficiency.\n\n193\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:08.180\nSo just because they have ISO\n20000 in their own organization\n\n194\n00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:13.380\ndoesn't necessarily mean that,\nthat ISO 20000 would be transferable.\n\n195\n00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.820\nSo, no, it's not going to be easy,\nJustin, it really isn't.\n\n196\n00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:22.190\nAnd this is one of the reasons why, well,\nyou'll hear a lot of people say that SIAM,\n\n197\n00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:26.510\nthe SIAM ecosystem and ISO 20000 are not\n\n198\n00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:31.990\nnecessarily compatible should we say.\n\n199\n00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.030\nI don't really like to use the word which\nis why I hesitate before I say that.\n\n200\n00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.825\nI really don't like to\nuse the word compatible.\n\n201\n00:13:37.825 --> 00:13:41.165\nWell, I don't like to say\nthat then not compatible but,\n\n202\n00:13:41.165 --> 00:13:44.125\nISO 20000 doesn't test for.\n\n203\n00:13:44.125 --> 00:13:46.905\nIt won't order the things\nlike collaboration, and for\n\n204\n00:13:46.905 --> 00:13:51.715\nintegration of process is an integration\nof tool sets, which makes it very,\n\n205\n00:13:51.715 --> 00:13:57.165\nvery difficult for an ISO 20000 auditor to\ncome in and audit that service integrator\n\n206\n00:13:57.165 --> 00:14:03.230\nbecause we simply don't have the audit\ncriteria to be able to do that.\n\n207\n00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.510\nNow, that's not to say that at some point\nin time in the near future we won't be\n\n208\n00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:08.680\nable to do that.\n\n209\n00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.580\nBut you can imagine that\nthe complexity of the SIAM ecosystem\n\n210\n00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.830\ndoesn't lend itself too\nwell to being audited.\n\n211\n00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.900\nAnd how annoyed, how frustrated\nwould a service integrator be,\n\n212\n00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:26.130\nwould a customer be,\nif they failed a particular audit\n\n213\n00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:31.180\njust purely because one service\nprovider couldn't produce one report.\n\n214\n00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.580\nWhich is potentially what could happen.\n\n215\n00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.540\nSo it's not something\nthat a lot of service\n\n216\n00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:41.160\nintegrators would want to try in achieve\nnecessarily because there are so\n\n217\n00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:46.600\nmany other influences on that achievement\nthat could actually prevent service\n\n218\n00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:51.502\nintegrator from achieving ISO 20000.\n&gt;&gt; So Jo, would you say that\n\n219\n00:14:51.502 --> 00:14:56.576\nmaybe cohesive these two things\nwere not as can't be made cohesive.\n\n220\n00:14:56.576 --> 00:14:58.870\nWould that be a better word\ninstead of compatible?\n\n221\n00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.170\nOr is that still kinda of a, eh?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n222\n00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.740\nI wouldn't necessarily say cohesive.\n\n223\n00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:11.760\nI would really say, I'm struggling really\nto find the right word because they're\n\n224\n00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.900\nnot, I mean when we say cohesive,\n\n225\n00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:19.020\nwe mean that we want everything to\nsorta work together as one unit.\n\n226\n00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:23.080\nAnd the problem is that ISO\n20000 will fit in very,\n\n227\n00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:29.060\nvery well with a SIAM ecosystem as long as\nwe don't have too many service providers.\n\n228\n00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.694\nBut the more service providers\nthat we bring into the mix,\n\n229\n00:15:31.694 --> 00:15:36.940\nthen the less chance of cohesion\nthere is within the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n230\n00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.120\nSo it's not cohesion between SIAM and\nISO 20000,\n\n231\n00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.900\nit's cohesion within the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n232\n00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.550\nLet's just take a look at\na slide that I have prepared and\n\n233\n00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.440\nI know that it actually says quite a lot.\n\n234\n00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:57.466\nBut you'll see that if customers\nwant to get ISO 20000 certified,\n\n235\n00:15:57.466 --> 00:16:03.700\nthey can use SIAM as a basis for\nthis service management system.\n\n236\n00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.745\nBut you know what, getting certification\nis going to be a challenge.\n\n237\n00:16:07.745 --> 00:16:13.360\nWherever we're bringing in external\norganizations, it's going to be challenge.\n\n238\n00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.540\nAnd then if we take a look at our\nintegrator layer, organizations\n\n239\n00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.600\nwho want to be a service integrator,\nagain, they may already have ISO 20000,\n\n240\n00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:26.550\nbut then that doesn't necessarily\nmean that in terms of\n\n241\n00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:31.300\nbeing a service integrator that\nactually they would achieve ISO 20000.\n\n242\n00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.390\nIf you're already a service provider and\nyou've got ISO 20000,\n\n243\n00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:39.380\nand then you start acting as a service\nintegrator and start using external\n\n244\n00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:44.430\nservice providers, then that may\njeopardize your ISO 20000 accreditation.\n\n245\n00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:50.710\nAnd of course a service provider\nthat doesn't have ISO 20000, well,\n\n246\n00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:57.360\nI mean by adopting an ISO 20000\nservice management system,\n\n247\n00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:02.280\nwe may bring some consistency into the way\nwe work with other service providers.\n\n248\n00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:06.408\nBut it doesn't necessarily mean that\nthey're going to achieve ISO 20000\n\n249\n00:17:06.408 --> 00:17:07.155\nthemselves.\n\n250\n00:17:07.155 --> 00:17:12.356\nSo in terms of service providers and\nISO 20000, I really,\n\n251\n00:17:12.356 --> 00:17:17.848\nreally wouldn't expect to see\na service integrator at this present\n\n252\n00:17:17.848 --> 00:17:22.760\nmoment in time trying to do\nsomething as complex as achieving\n\n253\n00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.699\nISO 20000 where you have\nmultiple service providers.\n\n254\n00:17:27.699 --> 00:17:32.724\nBecause quite simply those multiple\nservice providers are outside of the realm\n\n255\n00:17:32.724 --> 00:17:36.383\nof the service integrator's control.\n&gt;&gt; Now Jo,\n\n256\n00:17:36.383 --> 00:17:39.850\nis this, I'm kind of thinking\nabout the possible complexity.\n\n257\n00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.420\nAnd what I'm hearing, definitely,\ncorrect me if I'm wrong,\n\n258\n00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:47.500\nis the further we move our respective,\n\n259\n00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.980\nnot organization as a whole but\norganization of the ecosystem itself.\n\n260\n00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:55.780\nIf I have a few service providers,\nthen I'm still kinda close to that ITIL\n\n261\n00:17:55.780 --> 00:18:02.350\nstructure and it might be okay or it might\nbe doable to achieve the certification.\n\n262\n00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:06.890\nBut the further we moved,\nI'm just adding additional complexity on\n\n263\n00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:11.780\nthe complexity that's already there\nthat maybe it's hard to manage.\n\n264\n00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:16.780\nWould cause detriment or could cause\ndetriment if I try to achieve this\n\n265\n00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:21.518\nif I had a great deal of service\nproviders within the integrator level or\n\n266\n00:18:21.518 --> 00:18:23.173\nanything like that?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n267\n00:18:23.173 --> 00:18:26.423\nyou've asked two questions there,\nand one is really,\n\n268\n00:18:26.423 --> 00:18:31.006\nthe first thing that I wanna bring out\nis that you mentioned about having ITIL.\n\n269\n00:18:31.006 --> 00:18:34.322\nHaving ITIL will not,\nif you have an ITIL-based framework it\n\n270\n00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:37.526\ndoes not guarantee that\nyou've achieved ISO 20000.\n\n271\n00:18:37.526 --> 00:18:43.350\nSo achieving ISO 20000\nis slightly different.\n\n272\n00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:47.830\nI'd expect having an efficient and\neffective ITIL framework in\n\n273\n00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:51.990\nplace would facilitate\nyou achieving ISO 20000.\n\n274\n00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:56.030\nBut it's not a guarantee by any\nstretch of the imagination.\n\n275\n00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:00.285\nWhat we're looking for in ISO 20000\nis that service management system.\n\n276\n00:19:00.285 --> 00:19:07.740\nNow, you mentioned bringing in more\nservice providers adds complexity to it.\n\n277\n00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:12.513\nWell, of course it does, bringing in\nmore service provider actually could\n\n278\n00:19:12.513 --> 00:19:17.451\ndistance yourself from that achievement\nof ISO 20000 most definitely.\n\n279\n00:19:17.451 --> 00:19:22.542\nThe more people we are bring into the mix,\nthe more influences we have.\n\n280\n00:19:22.542 --> 00:19:26.729\nBut then, I shouldn't have said\n\n281\n00:19:26.729 --> 00:19:32.190\nthe less chance there is of achieving ISO\n20000 cuz that's not necessarily true.\n\n282\n00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.210\nIt depends how flexible\nthose providers are.\n\n283\n00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:39.560\nAnd how close to ISO 20000\nthe accreditation they are as well.\n\n284\n00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.510\nSo it may be easy.\n\n285\n00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.260\nWhat you're bringing in\nis more complexity, and\n\n286\n00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.480\nwith more complexity comes a greater risk.\n\n287\n00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.425\nSo I'm not gonna say it's less likely, but\nlet's just say there's a higher risk with\n\n288\n00:19:53.425 --> 00:19:56.015\nmore service providers that we have.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n289\n00:19:56.015 --> 00:19:58.152\nI think that answered my questions.\n\n290\n00:19:58.152 --> 00:20:02.016\nAnd to some extent, raising questions\nis hard when I was like, okay,\n\n291\n00:20:02.016 --> 00:20:03.862\nI'm juggling all these things.\n\n292\n00:20:03.862 --> 00:20:07.270\nNow, Jo,\nwe've been talking about ISO 20000 and\n\n293\n00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:11.837\nhow that relates to SIAM and to some\nextent ITIL, but we have some other kind\n\n294\n00:20:11.837 --> 00:20:15.485\nof management frameworks that\nwe're gonna take a look at.\n\n295\n00:20:15.485 --> 00:20:19.490\nAnd, well, what's on our plate for\ncoming up?\n\n296\n00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:21.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, we still have to.\n\n297\n00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.860\nIn other episodes,\nwe still gotta look at Lean.\n\n298\n00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:28.490\nWe're going to look at Lean Sigma,\nwe're also going to look at COBIT and\n\n299\n00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.960\nof course we're going to look\nat Project Management itself.\n\n300\n00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.040\nSo we're going to look at agile and\nwaterfall approach as well.\n\n301\n00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:39.258\nSo in our next episode, we're gonna take\na look at the Lean and COBIT frameworks.\n\n302\n00:20:39.258 --> 00:20:43.300\nAnd then in another subsequent episode\nwe're gonna look at project management\n\n303\n00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.500\nframeworks as well or methodologies.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n304\n00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.930\nI tell you what Jo, I'm kind of interested\nto see what COBIT actually stands for\n\n305\n00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.290\nand, well, hopefully you'll come\non back and find that with me.\n\n306\n00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.180\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget outta here.\n\n307\n00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.630\nSo signing out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n308\n00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:59.570\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n309\n00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:01.637\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n310\n00:21:01.637 --> 00:21:07.516\n[MUSIC]\n\n311\n00:21:07.516 -->

great.\n\n15\n00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.020\nThank you, Justin.\n\n16\n00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.330\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n17\n00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.060\nAnd COBITS,\nhad to say it again cuz it's fun.\n\n18\n00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.540\nIt probably stands for something but\nthese are not three letter acronyms.\n\n19\n00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.980\nCan you just give us a brief\noverview of Lean and COBITS just so\n\n20\n00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.640\nwe all have a level playing ground\nbefore we actually see how SIAM kind of\n\n21\n00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.040\nintertwines with this?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n22\n00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.553\nWell, you need to first of all\ndrop the f's on that COBIT thing.\n\n23\n00:01:00.553 --> 00:01:01.390\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n24\n00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.573\nThere's just one COBIT, Control Objectives\nfor Information Technology for IT.\n\n25\n00:01:06.573 --> 00:01:13.525\nAnd Lean Sigma is an evolution\nfrom Six Sigma of, well,\n\n26\n00:01:13.525 --> 00:01:18.895\nit's about process maturity but it's\nalso about process efficiency as well.\n\n27\n00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:24.015\nAnd so what we're going to do is we're\ngonna look at those two frameworks,\n\n28\n00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:27.620\nthose two methodologies, concepts,\nif you want to call them that.\n\n29\n00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.770\nAnd how they link into\nthis SIAM ecosystem, and\n\n30\n00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.180\nwe're actually gonna start off with Lean\nas opposed to the Control Objectives.\n\n31\n00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.310\nSo let's take a look at Lean then.\n\n32\n00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.510\nSo Lean is, as you can see from these\nparticular bullet points, Lean's\n\n33\n00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:50.080\nobjectives are to minimize waste\nby maximizing customer value.\n\n34\n00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.790\nIt's about doing more\nwith less you could say.\n\n35\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.760\nSo what we want to do here with Lean is we\nwant to continually improve our efficiency\n\n36\n00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.020\nand we want to do this by reducing\nwhat we call our Muda or waste.\n\n37\n00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.310\nAnd you'll see that bottom bullet\npoint talks about zero waste there.\n\n38\n00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.980\nSo what we want to do\nin the next particular\n\n39\n00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.490\nslide tells us a little bit more.\n\n40\n00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.332\nBut I see you looking confused already.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so all right,\n\n41\n00:02:22.332 --> 00:02:26.243\nrunning theme, the S that I add\non things that I don't need to.\n\n42\n00:02:26.243 --> 00:02:28.871\nBut besides that,\nyou said the word Muda and\n\n43\n00:02:28.871 --> 00:02:31.077\nI thought you were making up words.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n44\n00:02:31.077 --> 00:02:32.115\n&gt;&gt; But then it's\n\n45\n00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:33.840\non the slide.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n46\n00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.200\n&gt;&gt; So Muda is just waste?\n\n47\n00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.606\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's Japanese word for\n\n48\n00:02:38.606 --> 00:02:41.300\nwaste.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense.\n\n49\n00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.945\nI was like, here we go,\nare you all right, Jo?\n\n50\n00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:44.802\nYou're making up words now?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n51\n00:02:44.802 --> 00:02:47.335\n&gt;&gt; But Muda, that's kinda fun to say as\n\n52\n00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:52.288\nwell, I like this episode already.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, we wanna remove waste.\n\n53\n00:02:52.288 --> 00:02:56.515\nWe wanna reduce Muda and\nreducing or eliminating waste,\n\n54\n00:02:56.515 --> 00:03:01.269\neliminating Muda and I'm just\ngonna keep saying that now just to\n\n55\n00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.390\nkeep Justin happy.\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what, it puts a smile on my\n\n56\n00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.145\nface every time you say it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n57\n00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:07.079\n&gt;&gt; I'm like-\n\n58\n00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.125\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n59\n00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:08.721\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n60\n00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:10.445\n&gt;&gt; This is it, we're gonna start and\n\n61\n00:03:10.445 --> 00:03:13.774\nmake up our own language now,\nbut it's gonna be really, really,\n\n62\n00:03:13.774 --> 00:03:16.220\nthat's gonna be quite terrifying,\nisn't it?\n\n63\n00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.430\nIt's gonna be a mixture\nof sort of British and-\n\n64\n00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.155\n&gt;&gt; And hillbilly, I don't know.\n\n65\n00:03:23.155 --> 00:03:26.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; British redneck, okay,\n\n66\n00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.210\nthat's my new title.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n67\n00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.395\nBut Muda, anyway, we're removing waste--\n&gt;&gt; We're removing Muda, yes.\n\n68\n00:03:33.395 --> 00:03:34.890\n&gt;&gt; Inside of Lean.\n\n69\n00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:35.890\n&gt;&gt; We are removing Muda.\n\n70\n00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.490\nDo you remember when we looked at ITIL and\n\n71\n00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.870\nwe looked at efficiencies,\nI talked about minimizing waste.\n\n72\n00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.400\nAnd I actually talked about efficiency as\nremoving waste in three distinct areas.\n\n73\n00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.270\nDo you remember what those areas were?\n\n74\n00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.840\n&gt;&gt; Time.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n75\n00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.930\n&gt;&gt; Money.\n\n76\n00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:56.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n77\n00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.824\n&gt;&gt; And wait, Time,\n\n78\n00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:04.950\nmoney, I can't remember the third.\n&gt;&gt; Skill.\n\n79\n00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.930\n&gt;&gt; Skill, skill,\n\n80\n00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.149\nfor some reason I wanted to say people.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n81\n00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:11.009\n&gt;&gt; But I'm not removing people, but\n\n82\n00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:15.410\nremoving waste of people skills.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, so in ITIL,\n\n83\n00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.380\nwe look at waste as, or\nefficiencies as being\n\n84\n00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.440\nas doing something as\nquick as we possibly can.\n\n85\n00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.790\nSo with minimal wasted time,\n\n86\n00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.430\nwith minimal wasted money, and\nwith minimal wasted skills.\n\n87\n00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.050\nSo minimal waste in terms of time,\nmoney and skills.\n\n88\n00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.970\nThat doesn't mean that we've got to\ndo everything as quick as possible\n\n89\n00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.510\njust to get to an end goal, because\nsometimes then, well, we miss things.\n\n90\n00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.010\nMinimal waste is about doing\neverything that we need to do, but\n\n91\n00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.900\ndoing it in an efficient way.\n\n92\n00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.790\nSo it's about making the best\nuse of our money also.\n\n93\n00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.170\nSo you don't necessarily want to buy\nthe most expensive item when you go\n\n94\n00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.490\ninto the store, but you don't\nnecessarily wanna buy the cheapest.\n\n95\n00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.630\nYou want to buy the one that is the most\ncost-effective for what you need.\n\n96\n00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.774\nAnd in terms of scale width, when we\ntalk about ITIL, we'll talk about having\n\n97\n00:05:16.774 --> 00:05:19.959\nthe right person with the right\nskills to do that particular job.\n\n98\n00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:23.422\nIf somebody's overskilled,\nthey're not gonna work at 100%.\n\n99\n00:05:23.422 --> 00:05:27.287\nAnd if somebody's underskilled,\nthen obviously, they're not going to be as\n\n100\n00:05:27.287 --> 00:05:31.085\nefficient as somebody who's got\nthe appropriate number of skills.\n\n101\n00:05:31.085 --> 00:05:36.335\nAnd we also talk about here in Lean,\nwe'll talk about quality too.\n\n102\n00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:41.732\nSo it's about delivering for\nany service In a Lean environment,\n\n103\n00:05:41.732 --> 00:05:46.747\nit's about delivering the right\namount of functionality.\n\n104\n00:05:46.747 --> 00:05:49.580\nSo you don't wanna over\ndeliver on the functionality.\n\n105\n00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.290\nEnsuring that what we deliver\nin a service is right.\n\n106\n00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.740\nIt meets the needs of the organization.\n\n107\n00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.870\nBut as I said,\nyou don't wanna over deliver, but\n\n108\n00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.060\nyou don't wanna under deliver either.\n\n109\n00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.980\nSo this is what we mean by minimal waste.\n\n110\n00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.360\nLean looks at process\nimprovements specifically, but\n\n111\n00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.300\nensuring that we have minimal waste\nin terms of our processes, so\n\n112\n00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.210\nensuring that our\nprocesses have consistency.\n\n113\n00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.940\nThat means that we deliver\nthe same objective every time,\n\n114\n00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.010\nthat we deliver the right objective.\n\n115\n00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.570\nNot necessarily just the same but\n\n116\n00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.500\nit's gotta be the right\noutcome from every process.\n\n117\n00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.850\nBut we also want to do\nit in an efficient way.\n\n118\n00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.230\nSo we might implement things that in ITIL,\nwe call models.\n\n119\n00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.310\nAnd models, well,\nthey are predefined sets of steps.\n\n120\n00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.590\nSo they're predefined ways of\ndelivering a particular process or\n\n121\n00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.210\nof achieving a specific objective.\n\n122\n00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.110\nSo in other words, I've seen this before.\n\n123\n00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.900\nI've come across this\nparticular request before.\n\n124\n00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.610\nSo I don't need to go through\nall of these steps again.\n\n125\n00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.950\nI'm going to expedite these steps.\n\n126\n00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.660\nAnd I'll give you an example.\n\n127\n00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.780\nThe first time somebody requests\na particular type of laptop,\n\n128\n00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.890\nwe're going to go through a full\nevaluation process to ensure\n\n129\n00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:13.070\nthat that laptop does not have\na negative impact on our infrastructure.\n\n130\n00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:18.045\nSo the first time somebody comes to,\nwell, Nate, our IT guy.\n\n131\n00:07:18.045 --> 00:07:19.819\nFirst time somebody goes to Nate and says,\n\n132\n00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:22.540\ncan I have this particular\nlaptop on our infrastructure?\n\n133\n00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.740\nHe's gonna do a full evaluation of that\nlaptop to make sure it's not gonna bring\n\n134\n00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.690\nthe infrastructure down.\n\n135\n00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.457\nBut then the next time somebody wants\nexactly the same model make of laptop,\n\n136\n00:07:33.457 --> 00:07:37.990\nthen Nate doesn't need to go\nthrough all of those steps again.\n\n137\n00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.106\nAll he needs to do is just say,\nokay then, well,\n\n138\n00:07:41.106 --> 00:07:43.850\nI can fill out this particular paperwork.\n\n139\n00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.060\nI can ensure that we've got\nall of our call logs, etc.\n\n140\n00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.260\nAnd then I can just say, right,\nwell, I can build this laptop.\n\n141\n00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.030\nIt's not a problem.\n\n142\n00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.300\nIt's all because I've done it before.\n\n143\n00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.080\nSo it's about having minimal waste.\n\n144\n00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.615\nThe one thing that Nate's not going to do\nthough is to reinvent the wheel every time\n\n145\n00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:03.466\nbecause that's not efficient.\n\n146\n00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:07.906\nSo he doesn't need to evaluate everything\nevery single time somebody puts in\n\n147\n00:08:07.906 --> 00:08:08.680\na request.\n\n148\n00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.690\nIt's not efficient.\n\n149\n00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.984\nSo what Nate's going to do is ensure\nthat he's going to document what he did\n\n150\n00:08:13.984 --> 00:08:14.730\nthe first time.\n\n151\n00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:20.250\nAnd then the next time,\nhe's got those steps predefined.\n\n152\n00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.210\nSo what we're removing are things\nlike the duplication and\n\n153\n00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.220\nthe red tape and any constraints as well.\n\n154\n00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.110\nSo this is what Lean is all about.\n\n155\n00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.850\nSo let's think about Lean and\nin terms of SIAM.\n\n156\n00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.960\nAnd in terms of the SIAM ecosystem, well,\nof course everything that we should\n\n157\n00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.450\nbe doing, across all of our service\nproviders, should be in an efficient way.\n\n158\n00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.380\nThat's what we're aiming for,\nefficiency and effectiveness.\n\n159\n00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.130\nWe're aiming for\nthat delivery of value to our customers.\n\n160\n00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:58.290\nSo when you think about Lean and\nyou think about SIAM, well I expect that\n\n161\n00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:05.060\nthe Siam ecosystem should be implemented\nin a lean manner, in a lean way.\n\n162\n00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.450\nIt should be implemented in\na way that reduces waste.\n\n163\n00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:13.562\nWe want to aim for efficiency in\nabsolutely everything that we do,\n\n164\n00:09:13.562 --> 00:09:17.851\nso there is a perfect synergy\nbetween lean and Siam, and\n\n165\n00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:21.703\nin fact I expect us to\nimplement Siam In a lean way.\n\n166\n00:09:21.703 --> 00:09:25.670\nI don't expect us to implement\nSIAM in any other way.\n\n167\n00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.950\nIf we are implementing\nthis SIAM ecostructure\n\n168\n00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:33.560\nin a way that's not efficient,\nthen we're implementing it wrong.\n\n169\n00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:40.070\nNow, I do want to bring in the complexity,\nthough.\n\n170\n00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:45.400\nAnd with our ecosystem we have that\ncomplexity of multiple service providers.\n\n171\n00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:53.860\nHow do we ensure that each of our\nservice providers act in a lean way?\n\n172\n00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:58.920\nHow do we ensure that each of\nour service providers also\n\n173\n00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:05.089\nworks in a way that is the most\nefficient way for our organization?\n\n174\n00:10:05.089 --> 00:10:06.360\nNot for their organization.\n\n175\n00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.990\nLet's be fairly mercenary\nabout this process.\n\n176\n00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.300\nIn that particular service provider,\n\n177\n00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:18.130\nwhat we are concerned with is their\nimpact on us as the service integrator.\n\n178\n00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.480\nAs delivering value to our customer,\n\n179\n00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:25.070\nwe are concerned about how\ntheir ways of working and\n\n180\n00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:30.400\nhow their standard processes\nimpacts our ecosystem.\n\n181\n00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.160\nWe are not necessarily, well,\nwe shouldn't be concerned about how\n\n182\n00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.630\ntheir way of working impacts\ntheir entire environment.\n\n183\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:43.610\nAlthough that may be part of the criteria\nwhen it comes to selecting that\n\n184\n00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.810\nservice provider.\n\n185\n00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:49.881\nWe may want a service provider that\ncan demonstrate some Lean principles,\n\n186\n00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:54.962\nbecause we want to have that assurance\nthat they are certainly efficient.\n\n187\n00:10:54.962 --> 00:11:01.040\nSo when it comes to Lean, and I've got\na slide here that I've prepared for you.\n\n188\n00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.540\nSo as we've got written down here,\n\n189\n00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.400\nthen, these questions in front of us,\nthese come from our Lean guidance, and\n\n190\n00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:12.930\nthis is what we should be asking in our\nSIAM ecosystem for all of our processes.\n\n191\n00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.000\nSo look at this,\nwhat value does this process add?\n\n192\n00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.380\nWhat value does this particular\nstep in the process add,\n\n193\n00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:24.380\ndoes any step in our process repeat\nany other step from our process?\n\n194\n00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.142\nSo think about duplication,\nthink about efficiencies,\n\n195\n00:11:28.142 --> 00:11:31.901\nthis is not necessarily going\nto be an easy thing to apply,\n\n196\n00:11:31.901 --> 00:11:36.987\nbecause we're going to be applying this\nacross all of our service providers.\n\n197\n00:11:36.987 --> 00:11:41.519\nSo across the entire ecosystem,\nand as we've already mentioned,\n\n198\n00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:46.292\nit's quite relatively easy to implement\nin our service integrator but\n\n199\n00:11:46.292 --> 00:11:50.904\nnot necessarily so easy to implement\nacross our service providers,\n\n200\n00:11:50.904 --> 00:11:55.542\nespecially when we're talking\nabout external service providers.\n\n201\n00:11:55.542 --> 00:12:01.376\nSo Lean is absolutely perfect model\nto be applying across our ecosystem,\n\n202\n00:12:01.376 --> 00:12:06.195\nit's certainly something that we\nwant to be aspiring to, we have to\n\n203\n00:12:06.195 --> 00:12:11.840\nconsider the complexity of applying\nthis to all of our service providers.\n\n204\n00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.260\nAnd we have to understand that\nthis has got to be planned.\n\n205\n00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.582\nWhether we are talking\nabout existing processes,\n\n206\n00:12:17.582 --> 00:12:23.090\nwhich most service providers will already\nhave long before the ecosystem evolves.\n\n207\n00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:26.680\nLong long before we've decided\nto implement an ecosystem.\n\n208\n00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.940\nThese service providers will\nhave already had these processes\n\n209\n00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.490\nin place within their organization.\n\n210\n00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:37.479\nSo that means that not only will they\nhave to move towards our processes\n\n211\n00:12:37.479 --> 00:12:41.541\nto ensure the consistency\nacross our service delivery,\n\n212\n00:12:41.541 --> 00:12:45.106\nbut when we move them towards,\nto our processes.\n\n213\n00:12:45.106 --> 00:12:48.944\nWhen we evolve and\nwhen we transition them to our processes,\n\n214\n00:12:48.944 --> 00:12:53.320\nwe have to make sure that our\nprocesses can meet their requirements.\n\n215\n00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.470\nThat our processes can accommodate\ntheir ways of working.\n\n216\n00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.640\nBut we also have to ensure that our\nprocesses are essentially Lean.\n\n217\n00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.710\nSo that brings us into COBIT, or\nCOBITs as Justin liked to call it.\n\n218\n00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:13.860\nSo in COBIT then,\nCOBIT is our control objective and\n\n219\n00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:21.000\ncontrolled objectives for IT probably came\nabout from the financial institutions.\n\n220\n00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.180\nSo COBIT actually came about as\ncontrolled objectives from managing IT\n\n221\n00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.340\nin a finance arena.\n\n222\n00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:33.410\nAnd you can see that COBIT 5 which is\nthe latest iteration of COBIT it provides\n\n223\n00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:40.090\nus with some very well,\nthere are objectives for managing IT.\n\n224\n00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:46.720\nSome people will say, and I don't have any\nopinion either one way or the other, but\n\n225\n00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:52.620\nI've heard it said that this is more of a\nspecialized service management framework.\n\n226\n00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:58.410\nAnd whilst COBIT is not in\nconflict with ITIL which is what\n\n227\n00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.830\nI've heard from a lot of people is that\nCOBIT and ITIL are mutually exclusive.\n\n228\n00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:04.140\nThey are not.\n\n229\n00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:09.040\nWhat COBIT does is COBIT\nconcentrates on the strategy,\n\n230\n00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:15.830\nCOBIT concentrates on making decisions and\nCOBIT gives us objectives.\n\n231\n00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:22.790\nSo in some ways, some prescriptive ways,\nof looking at these objectives.\n\n232\n00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:28.560\nWhereas ITIL as a management framework\nwill give us a framework for\n\n233\n00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.240\nmanaging those objectives.\n\n234\n00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.930\nSo whilst COBIT allows us\nto define our endpoint, and\n\n235\n00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.230\nCOBIT allows us to define our strategy.\n\n236\n00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:41.020\nThen ITIL then allows us\nto deliver that strategy.\n\n237\n00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.730\nSo now I wanna bring then, I wanna\nbring the SIAM ecosystem into this.\n\n238\n00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.080\nSo think about how COBIT would fit in.\n\n239\n00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.580\nSo if we look at this, we've got to go\nthrough the numbers one through to five so\n\n240\n00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.770\nwe have In our five principles here,\n\n241\n00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:01.978\nwe have managing, stakeholder needs or\nrather meeting stakeholder needs.\n\n242\n00:15:01.978 --> 00:15:05.350\nSo understand in the strategy,\nunderstanding what our stakeholders\n\n243\n00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:09.510\nrequire and\nunderstanding what our businesses require.\n\n244\n00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:14.070\nThinking about the enterprise\nitself the end to end organization.\n\n245\n00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:19.450\nAnd applying an integrated framework and\nmanaging our services.\n\n246\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:25.170\nLook at that holistic approach again and\nseparating governance from management.\n\n247\n00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.970\nGovernance is about making\nstrategy decisions,\n\n248\n00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:34.855\nwhereas the management that's the\nframework for managing our IT services.\n\n249\n00:15:34.855 --> 00:15:38.519\nSo in terms of COBIT and\nSIAM, the SIAM ecosystem,\n\n250\n00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:42.740\nwell actually they work very,\nvery well together.\n\n251\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.500\nIn the same way that SIAM, the ecosystem,\n\n252\n00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:52.370\nis an evolution from ITIL,\nthen if we think of COBIT as being, well.\n\n253\n00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:57.071\nWe could also utilize COBIT in that\nevolution because COBIT will help us with\n\n254\n00:15:57.071 --> 00:15:58.180\nour governance.\n\n255\n00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:02.187\nCOBIT will help us with our strategy and\ndefining strategy for\n\n256\n00:16:02.187 --> 00:16:05.962\nour IT services, and\nhelping us to define our strategy for\n\n257\n00:16:05.962 --> 00:16:10.520\nthe service integrator, and\nalso within our customer environment.\n\n258\n00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:18.630\nSo in a nut shell, COBIT will compliment\nour SIAM ecosystem very, very well.\n\n259\n00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:24.310\nSo Justin, I say that you thinking.\n&gt;&gt; So I think it was interesting,\n\n260\n00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:28.580\nthere's even some verbage inside of those\nfive principles that I'm like, well,\n\n261\n00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:33.480\nthat's kinda reflective, like use a single\nintegrated framework, I guess that would\n\n262\n00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.860\nbe like the service integrator, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n263\n00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.723\n&gt;&gt; That would be the person that would\n\n264\n00:16:38.723 --> 00:16:43.666\nhelp uphold that part of COBIT,\nbut meeting stakeholder-\n\n265\n00:16:43.666 --> 00:16:44.238\n&gt;&gt; Expectations.\n\n266\n00:16:44.238 --> 00:16:47.343\n&gt;&gt; Expectations would how does that sit in\n\n267\n00:16:47.343 --> 00:16:52.894\nthe SIAM system [INAUDIBLE] who\nare the stakeholders in that capacity,\n\n268\n00:16:52.894 --> 00:16:53.970\nI guess.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n269\n00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:57.410\na stakeholder is defined\nas any interested party.\n\n270\n00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.370\nSo a stakeholder is absolutely anybody.\n\n271\n00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:03.600\nSo our service providers are stakeholders,\ncustomers are stakeholders, so on,\n\n272\n00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.660\nthe service integrators and\n\n273\n00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.550\npeople within the service integrators,\nthey are also stakeholders.\n\n274\n00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:12.130\nSo meeting stakeholder needs or\nmeeting stakeholder expectations for\n\n275\n00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:16.600\nour for a five print spools.\n\n276\n00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.740\nRemember, we talked about erasing rates\nfor c's and about the responsible,\n\n277\n00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.420\naccountable, consulted and informed.\n\n278\n00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:28.320\nThat is deciding on what level\nof responsibility a stakeholder\n\n279\n00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.535\nhas in the process but\n\n280\n00:17:31.535 --> 00:17:36.330\nCOBIT looks at this from the other\nside and says okay we have told,\n\n281\n00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.980\nwith our AC matrix, we have told our\nstakeholders what we expect from them.\n\n282\n00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.690\nBut we need to understand\nwhat they expect from us.\n\n283\n00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:45.280\nIt's a two way street.\n\n284\n00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.800\nSo those have a huge big\nmisconception in the IT world,\n\n285\n00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.050\nas a whole, these frameworks\ndon't work together at all.\n\n286\n00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.300\nAnd that these frameworks\nare mutually exclusive.\n\n287\n00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.920\nAnd in fact, that was something that you\nsaid to my in one of our previous episodes\n\n288\n00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.780\nwhen we started talking about Itel and\nwe started talking about SIAM.\n\n289\n00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.860\nThese frameworks, these methodologies,\nare mutually exclusive.\n\n290\n00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:09.720\nThey’re not.\n\n291\n00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.510\nThey actually work really well together,\nbut\n\n292\n00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:17.900\nyou have to understand them in order to\nbe able to get them working together.\n\n293\n00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.533\nIf you don’t understand them, and\n\n294\n00:18:20.533 --> 00:18:25.534\nthis one of the I guess one of\nthe pitfalls a lot of organizations fall\n\n295\n00:18:25.534 --> 00:18:30.536\ninto is that they will get this point\nmaybe consultants to come in and\n\n296\n00:18:30.536 --> 00:18:36.635\nto consultant in their own individual\narena or they will get disparate training.\n\n297\n00:18:36.635 --> 00:18:37.457\nIn other words,\n\n298\n00:18:37.457 --> 00:18:41.177\nwe'll have one person trained in one\nframe one person trained in another.\n\n299\n00:18:41.177 --> 00:18:45.398\nAnd because there's no synergy\nbetween them because we don't have any\n\n300\n00:18:45.398 --> 00:18:49.689\ncollaboration between the frameworks,\nthen they do get implemented,\n\n301\n00:18:49.689 --> 00:18:53.767\nin a mutually exclusive way, and\nthey end up sort of butting heads and\n\n302\n00:18:53.767 --> 00:18:57.020\nfighting against each other,\nand they shouldn't.\n\n303\n00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:01.130\nThere's absolutely no reason\nwhy that should happen at all.\n\n304\n00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.430\nBut you have to understand\nthe relationships and\n\n305\n00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:07.210\nif you understand the relationships,\nthen all of these frameworks\n\n306\n00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:11.850\nwill fit very nicely in with\na Siam ecosystem as well\n\n307\n00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:16.820\nas they work together very nicely in\nother sort of more traditional approaches\n\n308\n00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.680\nto IT service management.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n309\n00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.830\nwhat you're telling me as long as we\nhave appropriate perspective then these\n\n310\n00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:26.050\nframeworks can be complimentary\nto the things that we're doing.\n\n311\n00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:26.940\nRight?\nSo for\n\n312\n00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.960\nlean principles that about\nbeing efficient and effective.\n\n313\n00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.740\nReducing, what was it, what was it, mooda?\n\n314\n00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:34.850\nYeah, reduce mooda.\n\n315\n00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:36.820\nI just wanted to say that word.\n\n316\n00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:41.130\nAnd then those were respective\nfile principles in organization.\n\n317\n00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.400\nI guess that's why we only have\nthese multiple service providers and\n\n318\n00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.530\nwe have kind of this over arching,\nstarting to come together.\n\n319\n00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.810\n&gt;&gt; I like the use of the word.\n\n320\n00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.480\nI really like the word you used\nthere which was perspective.\n\n321\n00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.890\nAnd it is about having the right\nperspective on managing our IT services.\n\n322\n00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:03.710\nYou know as IT people, we sometimes get\n&gt;&gt; And we like the development work.\n\n323\n00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.542\nWe like the coding, and\nwe even like the support work and\n\n324\n00:20:06.542 --> 00:20:08.740\nwe forget about managing IT.\n\n325\n00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:13.756\nWe sometimes think that if we buy\na tool then that's going to do it for\n\n326\n00:20:13.756 --> 00:20:18.508\nus and because were IT people we\nthink that a tool is going to solve\n\n327\n00:20:18.508 --> 00:20:20.624\nall of the third world debt.\n\n328\n00:20:20.624 --> 00:20:21.906\nAnd it's simply not.\n\n329\n00:20:21.906 --> 00:20:26.993\nIt's not gonna bring world peace unless\nyou train it to bring world peace,\n\n330\n00:20:26.993 --> 00:20:31.914\nand this is a challenge that we have\nwith a lot of IT environments is that IT\n\n331\n00:20:31.914 --> 00:20:35.062\npeople might to get\ninvolved with the tools and\n\n332\n00:20:35.062 --> 00:20:38.710\nwe like to play with\nthe lights of new shiny toys.\n\n333\n00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:43.330\nBut we forget that these shiny toys are\nonly going to do what we ask them to do.\n\n334\n00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.390\nAnd we still have to be\nable to manage them,\n\n335\n00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:50.320\nso thinking of management frameworks, and\nthinking about how we're gonna manage\n\n336\n00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.470\nour services is just as important\nas the actual services themselves.\n\n337\n00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:59.930\nBecause if we don't have that\nperspective on our IT services,\n\n338\n00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:03.160\nthen they're never going to do what\nthe customers want them to do.\n\n339\n00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.382\nThey're never gonna deliver value.\n&gt;&gt; That makes me think if the only tool I\n\n340\n00:21:07.382 --> 00:21:10.218\nhave is a hammer,\nthen every problem looks like a nail and\n\n341\n00:21:10.218 --> 00:21:12.817\nI just go smashing around on it.\n&gt;&gt; That's sounds like my home, actually,\n\n342\n00:21:12.817 --> 00:21:14.687\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's not what we wanna do,\n\n343\n00:21:14.687 --> 00:21:17.115\nright, when we're managing these services,\nbut\n\n344\n00:21:17.115 --> 00:21:20.010\nwe have a few other frameworks\nthat we need to come and visit.\n\n345\n00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:23.870\nWhat do we have kind of\nleft on our agenda in this,\n\n346\n00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.970\nshall we say miniseries?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n347\n00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.980\nwell next we're going to be\nlooking at project management.\n\n348\n00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.400\nWell, we're gonna look\nat dev ops first of all.\n\n349\n00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.620\nAnd we're gonna look at\nthe concept of dev ops.\n\n350\n00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:38.303\nAnd then we're going to dip our toe\ninto the water of project management and\n\n351\n00:21:38.303 --> 00:21:41.887\nhow project management fits\nin with the SIAM Ecosystem.\n\n352\n00:21:41.887 --> 00:21:43.836\nWe already have, in the previous episode,\n\n353\n00:21:43.836 --> 00:21:45.950\nwe've had a quick look\nat project management.\n\n354\n00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:48.810\nAnd we've looked at project\nmanagement processes.\n\n355\n00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:54.280\nSo in our subsequent episodes, we're\ngoing to look at the DevOps environment.\n\n356\n00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:59.000\nWe're gonna look at waterfall approaches,\nand also the agile\n\n357\n00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.840\nproject management methodology as well.\n&gt;&gt; Well, these become very applicable\n\n358\n00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:07.250\nto me because it's one of those things\nwhere everybody has their own opinion.\n\n359\n00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:10.730\nSo I'm kinda interested\nto see not opinions but\n\n360\n00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:12.440\nwhat Jo has to say about this.\n\n361\n00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.270\nHopefully, you do as well.\n\n362\n00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.230\nSo definitely join us back.\n\n363\n00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:15.880\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n364\n00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.940\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n365\n00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.760\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n366\n00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.832\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n367\n00:22:22.158 --> 00:22:28.035\n[MUSIC]\n\n368\n00:22:28.035 --> 00:22:30.981\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

--> 00:00:09.977\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and welcome back to\n\n4\n00:00:09.977 --> 00:00:14.911\nanother exciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:17.223\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\n\n6\n00:00:17.223 --> 00:00:21.207\nwe're coming back at you with\nmore of our Siam Foundation,\n\n7\n00:00:21.207 --> 00:00:24.200\nand I almost put an s on it that time.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n8\n00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.563\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, I've been doing good on that\n\n9\n00:00:25.563 --> 00:00:26.322\nfoundation part.\n\n10\n00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:31.654\nBut we're actually gonna be talking about\nhow SIAM integrates with Dev-opps and\n\n11\n00:00:31.654 --> 00:00:34.260\nother project management, okay?\n\n12\n00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.604\nSo here to help us along in that\nvery endeavor is Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n13\n00:00:36.604 --> 00:00:41.359\nHow you doing today Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely fine, Justin, and I look\n\n14\n00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:46.274\nforward to my episode-ly dose of humor.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I tell you what,\n\n15\n00:00:46.274 --> 00:00:51.300\nI can't wait to get started as well,\nbut before we move any further, DevOps.\n\n16\n00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.585\nSometimes I find that to be a loaded term,\nso I would like to get your take on DevOps\n\n17\n00:00:55.585 --> 00:00:58.940\nbefore we actually move into kind\nof how these are integrated.\n\n18\n00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.860\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I am gonna try and\n\n19\n00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.595\nstay off my soapbox.\n\n20\n00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:03.747\nI said I'll try.\n\n21\n00:01:03.747 --> 00:01:07.383\nThey will probably come in handy,\ncuz I'd be a little bit taller, especially\n\n22\n00:01:07.383 --> 00:01:11.542\nwhen compared to you, but, nevertheless\nI'm gonna [LAUGH] try and stay off this.\n\n23\n00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:15.850\nAll right we're not preaching, but what\nI am going to say is that I am going to\n\n24\n00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.970\nexpress my frustration,\nbecause I get incredibly frustrated\n\n25\n00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.940\nwith people or organizations that would\n\n26\n00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.850\nconsider applying something like, and\nI said this in previous episodes as well,\n\n27\n00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.540\napplying frameworks in a rigid and\nprescriptive manner.\n\n28\n00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.470\nI think when I closed out the last\nepisode we talked really about the fact\n\n29\n00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.310\nthat all of our frameworks that we've\ntalked about so far can be implemented\n\n30\n00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.660\nwith a huge degree of synergy, and\nthey are incredibly compatible.\n\n31\n00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.550\nBut, you've got to approach these with\na sense of, and in fact it's a word\n\n32\n00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.330\nthat we just used in conversation just\na little while ago, which was agility.\n\n33\n00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.760\nYou have to approach these\nwith a sense of perspective.\n\n34\n00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.290\nYou have to ensure that with any framework\nyou don't plug and play any framework.\n\n35\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.300\nYou don't plug and play any\nmethodology that has to be adapted to\n\n36\n00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.440\nsuit the needs of your organization and\nyour environment.\n\n37\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.197\nNone of our frameworks, none of our\nmethodologies that we talk about\n\n38\n00:02:20.197 --> 00:02:23.065\nare something that is rigid,\nthat is cast in stone.\n\n39\n00:02:23.065 --> 00:02:27.739\nIf you try and implement or\ndeploy a framework in a strict, rigid,\n\n40\n00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.659\nstructured way, it's not gonna work for\n\n41\n00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.248\nyou, and this is where our frameworks\nget a lot of bad publicity,\n\n42\n00:02:35.248 --> 00:02:40.170\na lot of bad press, and\nthen we're told that it doesn't work.\n\n43\n00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.860\nAnd the reason why I mention this\nis [LAUGH] because you see one of\n\n44\n00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.610\nJustin's experiences when it\ncomes to project management, and\n\n45\n00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.960\nwhen it comes to frameworks, and he's\nbeen telling you about this, is the fact\n\n46\n00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.350\nthat a lot of organizations will apply\nthis too rigidly, and because of that, it\n\n47\n00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.983\ngets a bad press, because it doesn't seem\nto work, and DevOps is exactly the same.\n\n48\n00:03:01.983 --> 00:03:04.889\nDevOps is a mindset.\n\n49\n00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.360\nDevOps is a change in\nthe way that we think.\n\n50\n00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.520\nNone of our frameworks, and\nnone of our methodologies,\n\n51\n00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.065\nand none of our mindsets should\never be used as weapon, and yet\n\n52\n00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:22.860\n[LAUGH] I find that sometimes they are,\nand this is why they don't work.\n\n53\n00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.170\nDevOps, in its simplest form,\nis simply a sort\n\n54\n00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.185\nof just a match together of the words\ndevelopment and operations,\n\n55\n00:03:33.185 --> 00:03:38.140\nand what it should describe,\nand what it should refer to\n\n56\n00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.420\nis the synergy that should exist,\nthe collaboration that should exist,\n\n57\n00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.240\nbetween the development environment and\nthe operations environment.\n\n58\n00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.330\nNow, all right, you might wanna give\nthem some different terms like project\n\n59\n00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.020\nmanagement environment and\nservice management environment, but\n\n60\n00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.800\nit's about the fact that we're\nall working together in IT.\n\n61\n00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.013\nSo many times I hear phrases\nfrom operations like yeah,\n\n62\n00:04:06.013 --> 00:04:08.100\nthat's the project team.\n\n63\n00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.080\nThey threw that one over\nthe fence to us and\n\n64\n00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.650\nwe were expected to pick up the pieces and\nrun with it.\n\n65\n00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.160\nI hear that constantly.\n\n66\n00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.440\nThis is not how we should\nbe working together, and so\n\n67\n00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.230\nwhat's happened is over the years, as IT\nhas evolved, and I mean let's face it,\n\n68\n00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.760\nIT has been around really, I guess,\nsince the 1970s and into the 1980s,\n\n69\n00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.240\nand since IT has been around we have,\nI guess,\n\n70\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.840\nevolved down two separate paths,\nand that's the development path and\n\n71\n00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.070\nthe operational path, and\nnever the two shall meet.\n\n72\n00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.260\nThey don't seem to want to talk to each\nother in a lot of organizations, and\n\n73\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.280\nthat's sort of very,\nvery typical of the IT environment.\n\n74\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.000\nNow, way back in the 1980s when\nITIL first came out as a framework,\n\n75\n00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.670\nITIL introduced the concept of early life\nsupport, and early life support was really\n\n76\n00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:03.600\nsimply just instead of saying,\nhey look, here's a new service,\n\n77\n00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.060\nI'm gonna give it to you, and\nnow I'm gonna runaway as fast as I can.\n\n78\n00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.721\nThen what early life support\nproduced was the concept of,\n\n79\n00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:17.775\nlet's say Justin's my operations guy.\n\n80\n00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:19.610\nHere's my new service, Justin.\n\n81\n00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.022\nI'm gonna give it to you, but I'm gonna\nsit with you for a little while and\n\n82\n00:05:25.022 --> 00:05:29.754\nmake sure that everything's okay\nbefore I then leave you to it.\n\n83\n00:05:29.754 --> 00:05:33.408\nBut I wanna hand it over to you,\nthat's my ultimate goal.\n\n84\n00:05:33.408 --> 00:05:37.560\nBut, I wanna make sure that you're\nokay with it before I hand it to you.\n\n85\n00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.830\nNow that's early life support, but\nDevOps takes that one step further.\n\n86\n00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.630\nSo DevOps says, all right,\nI'm developing a new service.\n\n87\n00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.160\nBut in developing this new service,\n\n88\n00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.780\nI have to understand that Justin is\ngoing to be supporting that new service.\n\n89\n00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.700\nSo I'm gonna grab hold of Justin, and I'm\ngonna do this, why, because we're here,\n\n90\n00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.300\nand I'm gonna say, come here.\n\n91\n00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.628\nHe will, eventually.\n\n92\n00:06:05.628 --> 00:06:07.470\nIf have to, yes, see.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n\n93\n00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.073\n&gt;&gt; And Justin's gonna come here, and\n\n94\n00:06:09.073 --> 00:06:11.826\nI'm gonna say, no, you moved away again.\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, I didn't-\n\n95\n00:06:11.826 --> 00:06:12.614\n&gt;&gt; There, there.\n\n96\n00:06:12.614 --> 00:06:16.177\nSo Justin's gonna stand here,\nand I'm gonna say to him,\n\n97\n00:06:16.177 --> 00:06:18.350\nI'm gonna develop this for you.\n\n98\n00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.820\nIs that okay?\n\n99\n00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.255\nAnd you're gonna have some inputs,\nand then when it comes to the point\n\n100\n00:06:24.255 --> 00:06:28.313\nwhere we're now ready to deploy it,\nyou're gonna go back, and\n\n101\n00:06:28.313 --> 00:06:32.468\nthen I'm gonna come over here,\nand I'm gonna say right, okay.\n\n102\n00:06:32.468 --> 00:06:35.000\nSo, you're ready to support it.\n\n103\n00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.669\nLet me sit here, and\nlet me wait till you're okay, and then,\n\n104\n00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.468\neventually I'm gonna go back, and\nI'm gonna start working on something else,\n\n105\n00:06:43.468 --> 00:06:45.110\nand I know that he's okay.\n\n106\n00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.011\nThat's what DevOps is.\n\n107\n00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:53.655\nIn a nutshell, really simply\nthat's what DevOps should be.\n\n108\n00:06:53.655 --> 00:06:57.750\nDevOps is not supposed to be\nsomething that is prescriptive.\n\n109\n00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.118\nIt is not used as a weapon, and I think\nJustin used the words [LAUGH] earlier on.\n\n110\n00:07:02.118 --> 00:07:07.154\nYou said something to me about, this is\nwhere the developers get dragged in and\n\n111\n00:07:07.154 --> 00:07:10.220\ntry to be made sys admin or\nsomething like that?\n\n112\n00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.730\n&gt;&gt; It's funny,\n\n113\n00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.670\nbecause my experience is,\npeople will throw this term around,\n\n114\n00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.350\nand to some extent,\nwhat you're saying about a weapon is,\n\n115\n00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.790\nit brings up a point of contention envy,\nit almost creates divisiveness.\n\n116\n00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.150\nWhereas if we actually employed\nit the way that Jo said,\n\n117\n00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.430\nlet's say that I'm a developer, I'm gonna\nbe a better developer because I'm gonna\n\n118\n00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.060\nhave insights from the operations person,\nabout things that I maybe doing wrong.\n\n119\n00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.630\nLikewise, they may be doing something\nthat makes the deployment and\n\n120\n00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.620\nmanagement of said process or\nservice more difficult for them, and\n\n121\n00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.720\nI can go, well actually I meant for you\nto add this here, or whatever it may be.\n\n122\n00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.905\nIt should be a collaboration.\n\n123\n00:07:46.905 --> 00:07:51.407\nI've had some experiences where it's\nbeen made to either put additional\n\n124\n00:07:51.407 --> 00:07:56.778\nresponsibilities on me, and I go, I don't\nthink that's how this is supposed to work,\n\n125\n00:07:56.778 --> 00:07:59.391\nor it creates this like contention Right,\n\n126\n00:07:59.391 --> 00:08:00.555\nwhere.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n127\n00:08:00.555 --> 00:08:02.239\n&gt;&gt; I get a little extra responsibilities.\n\n128\n00:08:02.239 --> 00:08:07.070\nIt seems like I'm trying to circumvent\nthe operations individuals as a developer.\n\n129\n00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.690\nAnd then they're like,\nwell you don't know what you're doing.\n\n130\n00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.200\nAnd it's just not a healthy environment.\n\n131\n00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.000\nSo, it should be about collaboration,\n\n132\n00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.752\nnot about this kind of weird blah.\n&gt;&gt; It's not necessarily about\n\n133\n00:08:16.752 --> 00:08:19.838\nthe collaboration,\nit's actually about accountability.\n\n134\n00:08:19.838 --> 00:08:23.830\nIt's about accepting the fact that\nI've got an accountability to develop\n\n135\n00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.740\na service, that not only the customers,\nyou guys can use.\n\n136\n00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.680\nBut I've got to develop\na service that you can support.\n\n137\n00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.560\nThat's what I've got to do.\n\n138\n00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:38.730\nAnd so the only way that I've got to do\nthat is for me to, for start, ask you.\n\n139\n00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.800\nAnd get you involved because\nyou're doing the support.\n\n140\n00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:47.000\nBut also I'm also gonna sit with you and\nI'm gonna make sure\n\n141\n00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.994\nthat service that I've just\ndeveloped is supportable.\n\n142\n00:08:51.994 --> 00:08:55.879\nAnd it's gonna give me an insight into\nthat support environment as well.\n\n143\n00:08:55.879 --> 00:09:01.430\nSo it's about us working together but\nthe accountability is not all on me.\n\n144\n00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.520\nBecause the accountability is also on you.\n\n145\n00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.360\nBecause you're gonna get involved and\n\n146\n00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:12.210\nyour accountability there it's to ensure\nthat you highlight to me what you need.\n\n147\n00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.050\nAnd your accountability\nis to make sure that when\n\n148\n00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.730\nwe are together doing support work.\n\n149\n00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.110\nThen you're getting all of\nthe information from me, so\n\n150\n00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.480\nthat you can do your work afterwards.\n\n151\n00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.960\nSo there's no throwing it over the fence\nwith, here's a set of instructions.\n\n152\n00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.150\nI'm going to give you the instructions and\nI'm leaving now.\n\n153\n00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.680\nThere is none of that.\n\n154\n00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:39.300\nSo the accountability should be\nshared between development guys and\n\n155\n00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.750\nthe operations guys.\n\n156\n00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:45.320\nThis is not about throwing\nanything over the fence.\n\n157\n00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.785\nAnd it's not to be used as a weapon,\nthat's not what DevOps is about.\n\n158\n00:09:49.785 --> 00:09:53.090\nDevOps is about,\nas Justin says, collaboration.\n\n159\n00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:57.680\nIt's about having synergy between\ndevelopment and operation.\n\n160\n00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.180\nNow, I've already said\nthat DevOps is a mindset.\n\n161\n00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.690\nIt's a way of working.\n\n162\n00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.040\nIt's a common sense way of working.\n\n163\n00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.430\nThat's what it is.\n\n164\n00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:14.384\nThere are no defined set procedures for\nDevOps.\n\n165\n00:10:14.384 --> 00:10:18.899\nThis is just simply about a common sense\nway of working that actually delivers\n\n166\n00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:20.294\nvalue to the customer.\n\n167\n00:10:20.294 --> 00:10:22.799\nUltimately, that's what we\nshould be concerned with.\n\n168\n00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:26.563\nWe shouldn't be spending too much\ntime fighting amongst ourselves.\n\n169\n00:10:26.563 --> 00:10:28.468\nI mean Justin and I do, but\n\n170\n00:10:28.468 --> 00:10:31.250\nyou know, we can handle that.\n&gt;&gt; I would\n\n171\n00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.470\nargue that it's all in good fun,\nright, it is all in good fun.\n\n172\n00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:37.880\nI think If it really came down to it,\nJo, from our differing perspectives,\n\n173\n00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.190\nif we had a common goal that we needed to\nachieve then it's not really an issue.\n\n174\n00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.670\nI don't perceive that being an issue.\n\n175\n00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.700\nI have been in places where I've\nbeen told, figure that out for\n\n176\n00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:48.400\nyourself.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n177\n00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.640\n&gt;&gt; But you could take three minutes\n\n178\n00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.170\nand help me.\n\n179\n00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.470\nOr I could spend the next four\nhours doing something poorly.\n\n180\n00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.165\nAnd it just left a bad taste in my mouth.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n181\n00:11:01.165 --> 00:11:08.770\nYeah, I had actually created a slide that\nlooks at DevOps and the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n182\n00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.210\nAnd if we can just put that up on.\n\n183\n00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.650\nI know that yeah.\n\n184\n00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.960\nPerfect, our directors were amazing.\n\n185\n00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.920\nI'm always gonna sing their praises.\n\n186\n00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.340\nBut you'll see that we're looking at,\nwe've already talked about ownership and\n\n187\n00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.630\naccountability.\n\n188\n00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.040\nAnd sharing and the culture.\n\n189\n00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.300\nBut think about if we can, we want\nto add in some automation into that.\n\n190\n00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.750\nBut we also want to encourage learning.\n\n191\n00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.210\nWe want to encourage innovation and\nexperimentation.\n\n192\n00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.900\nNow all of these.\n\n193\n00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.390\nAbsolutely every single one\nof these can be difficult,\n\n194\n00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:42.610\ncan be complex in a SIAM ecosystem.\n\n195\n00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.240\nThat is not to say that\nwe should just ignore it.\n\n196\n00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.600\nWe shouldn't just ignore it.\n\n197\n00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.820\nWe have to achieve all of these.\n\n198\n00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:53.750\nA DevOps environment, as I've\nalready saidm is not about a way of.\n\n199\n00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.510\nIt's not about the set of processes.\n\n200\n00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.960\nIt's about a way of working.\n\n201\n00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.860\nIt's about collaboration.\n\n202\n00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.770\nIt's actually about a mindset.\n\n203\n00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.250\nAnd that's what we want to be applying.\n\n204\n00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.770\nSo now that we've started\ntalking about DevOps,\n\n205\n00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.770\nlet's spend a little bit more time\ntalking about the development.\n\n206\n00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.620\nLet's spend a little bit more\ntime talking about projects.\n\n207\n00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.750\nSo the first thing I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna ask you.\n\n208\n00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.190\nBecause you spent a lot of time coding.\n\n209\n00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.970\nYou spent of time in development work.\n\n210\n00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.510\nWhat do you know about the difference\nbetween a waterfall project, a waterfall\n\n211\n00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:29.640\napproach to project management, and\nan agile approach to project management?\n\n212\n00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.974\nWhat do you understand about that?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n213\n00:12:31.974 --> 00:12:32.499\nI may butcher this, Jo.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n214\n00:12:32.499 --> 00:12:34.489\n&gt;&gt; But a waterfall project is we have\n\n215\n00:12:34.489 --> 00:12:39.108\nthese distinct phases where maybe we\nhave the planning and design phase, and\n\n216\n00:12:39.108 --> 00:12:41.080\nthen we go into development.\n\n217\n00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.720\nAnd then we go into testing,\nand then we go into releases in\n\n218\n00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.890\nthese individual phases,\nsome exhorbitant amount of time.\n\n219\n00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.270\nWhat I'm saying exhorbitant\nis all of this is done and\n\n220\n00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.930\nthen it's handed over.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n221\n00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.000\n&gt;&gt; And then right the cost of\n\n222\n00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.310\nchange becomes increasingly\nexpensive as we move along.\n\n223\n00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:01.112\nAnd I kind of think of it as when\nold-school software was released,\n\n224\n00:13:01.112 --> 00:13:02.390\nlike Microsoft Word.\n\n225\n00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.290\nYou had these long development cycles.\n\n226\n00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.560\nAnd that's because,\nlet's plan these features.\n\n227\n00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.270\nLet's implement them.\n\n228\n00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.610\nLet's go to testing.\n\n229\n00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.600\nNow, let's go to release.\n\n230\n00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.849\nWhereas agile,\n\n231\n00:13:11.849 --> 00:13:17.749\nwe have kind of these shorter iterative\ncycles where we're always trying to.\n\n232\n00:13:17.749 --> 00:13:20.176\nI've gotta choose my words\nwisely because she'll burn me.\n\n233\n00:13:20.176 --> 00:13:21.362\nI can tell.\n\n234\n00:13:21.362 --> 00:13:23.547\nShe's looking at me.\n&gt;&gt; No, stop.\n\n235\n00:13:23.547 --> 00:13:24.052\nI won't.\n\n236\n00:13:24.052 --> 00:13:25.459\nI promise.\n&gt;&gt; So we have these shorter iterative\n\n237\n00:13:25.459 --> 00:13:29.120\ncycles where we're focusing on a core set\nof features, that we're always improving.\n\n238\n00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.570\nWe have some kind of\ndeliverable that is short, but\n\n239\n00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.340\nit also encompasses all of those things.\n\n240\n00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.550\nIn those short cycles, we have design,\nimplementation, testing.\n\n241\n00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.030\nAnd to some extent, deployment,\ndepending on your respective.\n\n242\n00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.850\nWhat you're building, really I argue,\n\n243\n00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.570\nyou probably do that anyway.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n244\n00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.530\nOkay.\nI kind of know what you're getting at.\n\n245\n00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.480\nAnd yes, you got it.\n\n246\n00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.915\nSo think of a waterfall approach\nas being a large project.\n\n247\n00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:54.905\nIt's a large-scale implementation.\n\n248\n00:13:54.905 --> 00:13:58.305\nIt's something that we've got to do\nat a specific point in time, and\n\n249\n00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:00.125\nwe've got an end date for that.\n\n250\n00:14:00.125 --> 00:14:01.595\nAnd so, in our waterfall approach,\n\n251\n00:14:01.595 --> 00:14:05.375\nwe've got to do absolutely everything\nin order to get us to that end date.\n\n252\n00:14:05.375 --> 00:14:07.575\nSo we might use a waterfall approach for\n\n253\n00:14:07.575 --> 00:14:12.405\nthings like, maybe we want to open\na new data center, for instance.\n\n254\n00:14:12.405 --> 00:14:14.780\nWe'd have a waterfall approach, perhaps.\n\n255\n00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.370\nTo that, it's something that's\ngonna happen in two years time.\n\n256\n00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:23.390\nAn agile approach allows for\nwhat we call continuous delivery.\n\n257\n00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.730\nSo it's an iterative approach.\n\n258\n00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.020\nWhich, going back to what I\nwas saying about continual and\n\n259\n00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.840\ncontinuous, I always like to refer\nto it as continual delivery.\n\n260\n00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.695\nBecause it's an iterative\napproach to delivery.\n\n261\n00:14:34.695 --> 00:14:39.082\nSo what we're doing is\nwere delivering specific\n\n262\n00:14:39.082 --> 00:14:42.937\nchunks of functionally at any given time.\n\n263\n00:14:42.937 --> 00:14:46.029\nSo we have what we call sprints or\niterations.\n\n264\n00:14:46.029 --> 00:14:50.896\nAnd each iteration which is a development\ncycle will take anywhere between one and\n\n265\n00:14:50.896 --> 00:14:52.380\nfour weeks.\n\n266\n00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.510\nAnd during those, let's say two weeks,\nlet's go for the median.\n\n267\n00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:01.270\nDuring those two weeks,\nthe we develop a particular user story,\n\n268\n00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:04.070\nit's designed,\nit's developed, it's tested.\n\n269\n00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.510\nIt's not necessarily deployed.\n\n270\n00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.388\nWhat we may choose to do is we\nmay choose to wait for three or\n\n271\n00:15:10.388 --> 00:15:13.043\nfour particular iterations.\n\n272\n00:15:13.043 --> 00:15:14.706\nAnd then we will release.\n\n273\n00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:18.433\nBecause we don't necessarily to release\nevery week if we're doing an iteration\n\n274\n00:15:18.433 --> 00:15:19.470\nevery week.\n\n275\n00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:22.400\nIt's too much impact to\nthe customer environment.\n\n276\n00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.770\nSo think about it as Justin said.\n\n277\n00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:31.080\nMany, many years ago when Windows was\nupdated there was a huge big update.\n\n278\n00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.250\nAnd in that case, every few years\nwe'd get a new version of Windows.\n\n279\n00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.180\nAnd now look at your cell\nphones that we have now.\n\n280\n00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.560\nIn your cell phones,\nwell, there's an update.\n\n281\n00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.290\nThere's a patch.\n\n282\n00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:40.862\nThere's a fix.\n\n283\n00:15:40.862 --> 00:15:43.664\nThere's an update to apps that's\nreleased every couple of weeks.\n\n284\n00:15:43.664 --> 00:15:47.409\nAt least once a month you've got\na new update to your cell phone.\n\n285\n00:15:47.409 --> 00:15:54.181\nSo that is an agile release as opposed\nto the big huge waterfall approach,\n\n286\n00:15:54.181 --> 00:15:59.548\nwhich is what we used to have\nin that Windows environment.\n\n287\n00:15:59.548 --> 00:16:00.923\nSo Agile.\n\n288\n00:16:00.923 --> 00:16:04.628\nIt's continual delivery of our services.\n\n289\n00:16:04.628 --> 00:16:11.280\nAnd Agile allows for delivery of\nfunctionality in an iterative manner.\n\n290\n00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.740\nSo that allows us to build up momentum.\n\n291\n00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:19.130\nThat allows us to well,\nto create some momentum to start off with.\n\n292\n00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:20.776\nIt allows us to build up morale.\n\n293\n00:16:20.776 --> 00:16:24.341\nThink of this as continual\nservice improvement with every\n\n294\n00:16:24.341 --> 00:16:27.469\nsingle iteration we deliver\na new functionality,\n\n295\n00:16:27.469 --> 00:16:31.850\nand therefore we are improving our\ncredibility as a service provider.\n\n296\n00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:39.193\nSo let's take a look at the Agile\nmanifesto which is where Agile comes from.\n\n297\n00:16:39.193 --> 00:16:45.460\nAgile values, individuals and\ninteractions over processes and tools.\n\n298\n00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:51.210\nSo we value individuals rather\nthan the process, okay?\n\n299\n00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:57.870\nAgile also values work in software\nover comprehensive documentation.\n\n300\n00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.207\nHm, that's a thought.\n\n301\n00:16:59.207 --> 00:17:03.600\nAgile values collaboration\nover contract negotiation.\n\n302\n00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:10.202\nAnd Agile also values responding\nto change over following a plan.\n\n303\n00:17:10.202 --> 00:17:11.512\nWhoa.\n\n304\n00:17:11.512 --> 00:17:19.683\nNow we have the guiding principles\nwhich is what our values are based on.\n\n305\n00:17:19.683 --> 00:17:23.111\nBut let's think about this in the SIAM\necosystem that we're in right now.\n\n306\n00:17:23.111 --> 00:17:26.952\nBecause this is the series that we're\ndoing right now, we're looking at SIAM and\n\n307\n00:17:26.952 --> 00:17:30.090\nlet's think about these values\nthat we have in front of us.\n\n308\n00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:33.150\nAnd how we can apply these\nvalues in the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n309\n00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:38.490\nBecause the SIAM ecosystem, whilst we're\nusing this to refer to service management,\n\n310\n00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.100\nit's not just about service management.\n\n311\n00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:45.551\nThough we're using these individual\nservice providers to actually deliver our\n\n312\n00:17:45.551 --> 00:17:49.550\nservices as well, so to design and\ndevelop and deliver these services.\n\n313\n00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:53.489\nSo we're gonna value individuals and\ninteractions over processes and tools.\n\n314\n00:17:55.176 --> 00:18:00.366\nThat's gonna make it very,\nvery challenging for\n\n315\n00:18:00.366 --> 00:18:05.557\nthe service integrator to\nmanage an agile project\n\n316\n00:18:05.557 --> 00:18:11.008\nwhen it is spread across so\nmany service providers.\n\n317\n00:18:11.008 --> 00:18:15.515\nBecause if we are valuing interactions,\nwhich we will do,\n\n318\n00:18:15.515 --> 00:18:19.573\nthis conversation that Justin and\nI are having is more\n\n319\n00:18:19.573 --> 00:18:24.370\nimportant than the actual process itself,\nand that's fine.\n\n320\n00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.861\nBut if we don't have a process,\n\n321\n00:18:26.861 --> 00:18:31.754\nthen think about all of those\nservice providers that we have and\n\n322\n00:18:31.754 --> 00:18:37.310\nthink of the chaos that's going to\nensue if we don't have any process.\n\n323\n00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.110\nThat is not to say that we don't have.\n\n324\n00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:44.340\nSo when we think about this value it's not\nto say that we don't have any processes.\n\n325\n00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.100\nWe do, but\nthen think about our lean principles.\n\n326\n00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.234\nWe looked at these in a previous episode.\n\n327\n00:18:50.234 --> 00:18:55.352\nIf those processes are efficient,\nthen that works perfectly.\n\n328\n00:18:55.352 --> 00:18:59.131\nIf they're not efficient,\nif they're too bureaucratic,\n\n329\n00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:02.450\nif there's too much red tape, guess what?\n\n330\n00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.125\nWe have chaos.\n\n331\n00:19:04.125 --> 00:19:07.250\nWork in software over\nthe comprehensive documentation.\n\n332\n00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.951\nI know a lot of organizations\nthat will say, and\n\n333\n00:19:13.951 --> 00:19:16.634\nI see Justin thinking about this because I\nknow a lot of organizations that perceive\n\n334\n00:19:16.634 --> 00:19:18.300\nthat to mean we don't have\nto write anything down.\n\n335\n00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.020\nThat's not the case.\n\n336\n00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.950\nIt says work in software over\ncomprehensive documentation.\n\n337\n00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:26.740\nIt doesn't mean we don't\nhave any documentation.\n\n338\n00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:30.600\nYes we do.\nBut again think lean principles.\n\n339\n00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.700\nYou write down what you need and\nnot absolutely everything,\n\n340\n00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.240\nespecially any information that's\nsuperfluous to requirements.\n\n341\n00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.441\nJustin's desperate to say something,\n\n342\n00:19:39.441 --> 00:19:41.773\nI can see it out the corner of my eye.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n343\n00:19:41.773 --> 00:19:44.518\nwhat I've seen is people\nwhen they read these values,\n\n344\n00:19:44.518 --> 00:19:48.230\nthey'll read individual interactions\ninstead of processes and tools.\n\n345\n00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.608\nOr working software instead of.\n\n346\n00:19:50.608 --> 00:19:51.860\nNo, it says over.\n\n347\n00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:57.140\nIt doesn't mean that we don't have\nthe other part of that value, right?\n\n348\n00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.820\nI know for a fact that I can\nbe a little bit of a talker.\n\n349\n00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:04.699\nAnd if we need to have a process,\na defined process, in order to facilitate\n\n350\n00:20:04.699 --> 00:20:09.580\nthese interactions and things like that,\nthen that's perfectly fine.\n\n351\n00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.980\nThose may be needed.\n\n352\n00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.620\nDocumentation, I can attest to it.\n\n353\n00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.327\nIf I pick up a software project\nthat has zero documentation,\n\n354\n00:20:17.327 --> 00:20:19.660\nI'm not saying I won't work with it.\n\n355\n00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.823\nThere's a good chance that I'm\ngoing to take a really long time,\n\n356\n00:20:23.823 --> 00:20:25.725\nkinda wrap my head around it.\n\n357\n00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:29.030\nI become inefficient because it\ntakes me so much time to kinda--\n\n358\n00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.209\n&gt;&gt; You're reinventing the wheel\n\n359\n00:20:30.209 --> 00:20:30.710\nevery time.\n\n360\n00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.821\nAnd when you think about a project,\nwhen was the last time you started off\n\n361\n00:20:33.821 --> 00:20:35.770\na project with a blank\npiece of paper anyway?\n\n362\n00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.880\nWe don't.\nWe already have an environment in place.\n\n363\n00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.765\nSo if there's no documentation\nthat supports that environment,\n\n364\n00:20:41.765 --> 00:20:44.088\nthen you are having to\nreinvent the wheel every time.\n\n365\n00:20:44.088 --> 00:20:46.600\nIt's not efficient, it really isn't.\n\n366\n00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.760\nBut you're right,\nif we look at those values,\n\n367\n00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.276\nthose values state individuals and\ninteractions over processes.\n\n368\n00:20:54.276 --> 00:20:59.500\nIt doesn't say as you said, it doesn't\nsay the word instead of, it says over.\n\n369\n00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.094\nIt's working software over\ncomprehensive documentation.\n\n370\n00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:04.965\nSo that's not to say that we\ndon't have any documentation.\n\n371\n00:21:04.965 --> 00:21:08.970\nYou just got to make sure that\nthe documentation is lean.\n\n372\n00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.250\nAnd I love the use of the word lean.\n\n373\n00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.144\nAnd lean when it comes to Agile,\nwhen it comes to Agile.\n\n374\n00:21:13.144 --> 00:21:15.017\nAnd when it comes to SIAM,\n\n375\n00:21:15.017 --> 00:21:19.370\nlean should be applied to\nabsolutely everything that we do.\n\n376\n00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:24.280\nAnd we have processes in place here for\nhow we do certain things.\n\n377\n00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.615\nAnd it doesn't mean\nthat our documentation,\n\n378\n00:21:27.615 --> 00:21:31.687\nwe actually apply Agile principles, and\nwe apply lean principles very, very well,\n\n379\n00:21:31.687 --> 00:21:35.266\nbecause it doesn't mean that our\ndocumentation is comprehensive at all.\n\n380\n00:21:35.266 --> 00:21:37.090\nWe've got documentation.\n\n381\n00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:39.470\nIt's just lean documentation,\nwould you say?\n\n382\n00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.943\nI would say it's kind of the minimal\nnecessary to keep moving forward\n\n383\n00:21:43.943 --> 00:21:48.878\nwithout going, wait a minute, I gotta go,\nlet me check this other folder,\n\n384\n00:21:48.878 --> 00:21:51.580\nlet me think about this for a while.\n\n385\n00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.646\nAnd it doesn't seem like they\nwould have a huge impact,\n\n386\n00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:58.626\nyou're like well, have just a little bit,\nthat's about having none,\n\n387\n00:21:58.626 --> 00:22:01.120\nI'm gonna test that is\nabsolutely not true.\n\n388\n00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.473\nEven just minimal amount of documentation\ncan help you kind of jumpstart and\n\n389\n00:22:05.473 --> 00:22:10.008\nget back into the rhythm of things.\n&gt;&gt; Well, look at the next one, and\n\n390\n00:22:10.008 --> 00:22:13.690\nwe've spoken about this one\nactually in previous episodes,\n\n391\n00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:17.460\nwhich is customer collaboration\nover contract negotiation.\n\n392\n00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:21.780\nIf our contracts, and\nI've already said this so many times.\n\n393\n00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:25.134\nThat if our contracts are too rigid,\nif we've got penalties and\n\n394\n00:22:25.134 --> 00:22:28.128\nincentives in there that\nwe're going to apply rigidly.\n\n395\n00:22:28.128 --> 00:22:30.707\nThen what you get is you'll\nget a service provider that\n\n396\n00:22:30.707 --> 00:22:33.920\nsays doesn't say this in the contract\ntherefore I'm not doing it.\n\n397\n00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.493\nGo back to what we were thinking\nabout in previous episodes,\n\n398\n00:22:37.493 --> 00:22:39.250\nabout incident management.\n\n399\n00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:42.050\nWe've got these three layers, okay?\n\n400\n00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.715\nWe've got our customer,\nwe've got our service integrator, and\n\n401\n00:22:45.715 --> 00:22:48.870\nwe've got our individual\nservice providers.\n\n402\n00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.866\nIf you have between your service\nintegrator and your customer,\n\n403\n00:22:52.866 --> 00:22:55.678\nif you've got a four-hour\nresponse here and\n\n404\n00:22:55.678 --> 00:22:59.314\neverything here's got to happen\nin less than four hours.\n\n405\n00:22:59.314 --> 00:23:03.813\nwhich means that sometimes, this service\nprovider, well he'll get three hours\n\n406\n00:23:03.813 --> 00:23:07.740\nto take a look at an incident, but\nthis one might only get 30 minutes.\n\n407\n00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:12.928\nYou have to have the flexibility in there,\notherwise this is not going to work.\n\n408\n00:23:12.928 --> 00:23:17.057\nThe SIAM ecosystem is not going\nto work without that value,\n\n409\n00:23:17.057 --> 00:23:21.330\nwithout the collaboration\nover contract negotiation.\n\n410\n00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.760\nAnd again, it doesn't mean that\nwe don't have any contracts,\n\n411\n00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.460\nit just means that you gotta be\nreally careful about your contracts.\n\n412\n00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:33.402\nBecause if you've got suppliers that are\ngonna stick to the letter of that contract\n\n413\n00:23:33.402 --> 00:23:36.730\nrigidly, then the SIAM\necosystem is not going to work.\n\n414\n00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.105\nAnd that goes back,\n\n415\n00:23:40.105 --> 00:23:44.504\nalso to this respondent to\nchange over following a plan.\n\n416\n00:23:44.504 --> 00:23:49.814\nAgain, we have to have\nflexibility in here,\n\n417\n00:23:49.814 --> 00:23:52.760\nbecause things change.\n\n418\n00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:57.330\nAnd we've got to be able to change.\n\n419\n00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:00.878\nHe's thinking again, staring.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n420\n00:24:00.878 --> 00:24:04.907\nit's just kind of hitting me now, because\nthis is something that I'm a little,\n\n421\n00:24:04.907 --> 00:24:07.890\nlittle more comfortable than\nsome of our previous things.\n\n422\n00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:12.087\nSomething that you've kind of\nreinforced over this episode and\n\n423\n00:24:12.087 --> 00:24:13.410\nthe last couple of episodes.\n\n424\n00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:15.890\nWe should have the flexibility.\n\n425\n00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.263\nWe can't have like rigid, I don't know.\n\n426\n00:24:18.263 --> 00:24:22.540\nAlmost dictatorial, this is how it is.\n\n427\n00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.749\nI would say that as technical\npeople that tends to be our bent,\n\n428\n00:24:25.749 --> 00:24:29.220\nbecause we like rules and\nkind of this very algorithmic approach.\n\n429\n00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:34.594\nBut where the hiccup comes in as\nwith actually agile is if people.\n\n430\n00:24:34.594 --> 00:24:39.680\nThis collaboration, let's both\ncreate a win here instead of going.\n\n431\n00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.500\nIt's your fault, because you didn't\nhold up your end of the deal.\n\n432\n00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.380\nWe don't want this divisive environment.\n\n433\n00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.970\nWe want to come together and\ndeliver value, and get things done.\n\n434\n00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:53.559\nNot with the expectation that it's\nalways going to be like necessarily, but\n\n435\n00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:57.439\nwith the expectation that, okay,\nwell, it's kind of a give and\n\n436\n00:24:57.439 --> 00:25:00.688\ntake I guess.\n&gt;&gt; You would not believe the amount of\n\n437\n00:25:00.688 --> 00:25:06.125\ntimes I have directed organizations in\nconducting major incident reviews and\n\n438\n00:25:06.125 --> 00:25:10.324\nmajor problem reviews and\nI've had to walk in there and say,\n\n439\n00:25:10.324 --> 00:25:12.320\nthis is not a post-mortem.\n\n440\n00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:17.270\nThis is not an exercise\nin apportioning blame.\n\n441\n00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.623\nThis is an exercise in lessons learned.\n\n442\n00:25:20.623 --> 00:25:25.934\nAnd if we're using any process or\nany process medium like\n\n443\n00:25:25.934 --> 00:25:31.300\na working group, for\ninstance, or a process forum.\n\n444\n00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.820\nIf we using that as weapon to beat\nsomebody with then quite clearly,\n\n445\n00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:39.830\nwe're not gonna get that collaboration and\nyou're gonna get to the point where people\n\n446\n00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:43.700\nare gonna say that's not in my\njob description I'm not doing it.\n\n447\n00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:48.870\nAnd as IT people, we do tend to be\nreally rigid in our thought process.\n\n448\n00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:53.343\nWe like to look at what's written down and\nsay, right,\n\n449\n00:25:53.343 --> 00:25:56.460\nokay, we're doing this this way.\n\n450\n00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.680\nBecause we know it delivers this result.\n\n451\n00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:03.172\nUnfortunately, when it comes\nto managing our services,\n\n452\n00:26:03.172 --> 00:26:07.768\nwe have to actually think about the people\nthat are managing the services as well\n\n453\n00:26:07.768 --> 00:26:11.901\nas the technology itself and\nit's funny that you should mention that.\n\n454\n00:26:11.901 --> 00:26:15.977\nBecause when we come back in our next\nepisode, we're actually going to look\n\n455\n00:26:15.977 --> 00:26:19.734\nat the culture of the SIAM ecosystem and\nwe're gonna look at people and\n\n456\n00:26:19.734 --> 00:26:22.210\nhow we manage people.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n457\n00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:26.382\nthat ends up being a no [INAUDIBLE]\nlike people, I don't know.\n\n458\n00:26:26.382 --> 00:26:30.360\nThat ends up being a very important\npart of some of these techniques.\n\n459\n00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.482\nAnd even if you're not\nthe management capacity,\n\n460\n00:26:32.482 --> 00:26:34.361\nI guess you should be\naware of these things.\n\n461\n00:26:34.361 --> 00:26:37.594\nNow just before we head out,\nI do have one final question for\n\n462\n00:26:37.594 --> 00:26:39.350\nyou from an Agile perspective.\n\n463\n00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:45.554\nYou said, the service integrator may have\na difficult time managing an Agile project\n\n464\n00:26:45.554 --> 00:26:48.630\nthat spans multiple service providers.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n465\n00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.500\n&gt;&gt; Difficult though, not impossible.\n\n466\n00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:56.430\nIs it possible that each service provider\nmay have, I don't know like there\n\n467\n00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:01.305\nare some projects that are managed\nin an Agile way that the service\n\n468\n00:27:01.305 --> 00:27:05.570\nintegrator may not be involved with,\nbut they're delivering value to them?\n\n469\n00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:10.290\nIs that one way to help facilitate\nthis kind of culmination?\n\n470\n00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:14.165\n&gt;&gt; We do have other series where we look\n\n471\n00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:19.343\nat the Agile project\nwith this SIAM ecosystem.\n\n472\n00:27:19.343 --> 00:27:24.280\nBut to sum it up really quickly,\nI guess and really easily and certainly\n\n473\n00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:29.962\nremembering that we're at a foundation\nlevel where you wanna keep the management\n\n474\n00:27:29.962 --> 00:27:35.004\nof your projects as much as possible\nin that service integrative layer.\n\n475\n00:27:35.004 --> 00:27:38.767\nBecause then the management\nwhether it be the scrum master or\n\n476\n00:27:38.767 --> 00:27:42.825\nbe the product owner that particular\nlevel of the Agile project,\n\n477\n00:27:42.825 --> 00:27:47.471\nthese are the people that are managing\nthe work of all of the individuals and\n\n478\n00:27:47.471 --> 00:27:51.130\nthe individuals within\nvarious service providers.\n\n479\n00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:54.080\nThere has to be some\nintegration between them.\n\n480\n00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:58.515\nSo what we might I want to give\nresponsibility to some service providers,\n\n481\n00:27:58.515 --> 00:28:01.090\nwe can only do that if\nthat service provider\n\n482\n00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:04.705\nthen has oversight over\nthe other service providers.\n\n483\n00:28:04.705 --> 00:28:06.643\nWe have to ensure that there\nis collaboration there.\n\n484\n00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:10.239\nAnd ultimately, somebody's got to\nensure that that collaboration\n\n485\n00:28:10.239 --> 00:28:13.046\nexists.\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you have it.\n\n486\n00:28:13.046 --> 00:28:16.726\nThere's never any easy answers,\nbut that does make sense.\n\n487\n00:28:16.726 --> 00:28:20.858\nYou need to kinda have some kind of\noversight, because we have a lot going\n\n488\n00:28:20.858 --> 00:28:25.360\non in the cyber ecosystem, especially\nthis week further service providers.\n\n489\n00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.540\nAnd well,\nyou'll definitely have to come back.\n\n490\n00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.670\nBecause we're digging into culture.\n\n491\n00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:31.830\nI know people, it's kind of scary,\nbut definitely come on back.\n\n492\n00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.430\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n493\n00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:35.560\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\n\n494\n00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.690\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n495\n00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:45.890\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n496\n00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:50.899\n[MUSIC]\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:05.920\n&gt;&gt; Live from San Francisco.\n\n4\n00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.289\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:12.968\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:12.968 --> 00:00:15.789\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:17.509\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\n\n8\n00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:20.118\nwere coming back at you with\nmore SIAM foundation and\n\n9\n00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:23.695\nwere going to be making some cultural\nconsiderations in this episode.\n\n10\n00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:28.815\nAnd luckily, well, we have someone who's\ngoing to lead us by example the one and\n\n11\n00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:30.336\nonly Miss Joe Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:30.336 --> 00:00:32.140\nHow are you doing today, Joe?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great and\n\n13\n00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.125\nhow are you Justin?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n14\n00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:36.758\nNow admittedly so sometimes,\n\n15\n00:00:36.758 --> 00:00:42.334\nI'm unaware of cultural differences and\nI do tend to apologize.\n\n16\n00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:46.500\nBut really, in this episode we're gonna\nbe talking about the people, right, for\n\n17\n00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.340\na respected organization.\n&gt;&gt; We are, but\n\n18\n00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.040\nnot just a respected organization.\n\n19\n00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.330\nWe're gonna be talking about people for a\nnumber of organizations, because obviously\n\n20\n00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.410\nin this SIAM ecosystem that we are in,\nthen we have to consider the culture\n\n21\n00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.740\nwithin our customer organization\nwithin our service integrator and\n\n22\n00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.960\nalso the culture and the people that exist\nwithin our service providers, as well.\n\n23\n00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.790\nSo, when we talk about cultural\nconsiderations, we have to consider\n\n24\n00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.560\ncultures from many different\nviewpoints and many different aspects.\n\n25\n00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.720\nLet's just take a look at the slide that\nwe have in front of us right now and\n\n26\n00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.760\nyou'll see that we have\ngot to consider culture,\n\n27\n00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.790\nright away through for our sourcing and\ncontractual negotiations, right?\n\n28\n00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.440\nThe way through to the operation\nof our Siam ecosystem and\n\n29\n00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.350\nalso the support of our customers as well.\n\n30\n00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.170\nWe have to consider cultural change and\nthe differences that will occur to\n\n31\n00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.460\nthe costumer organization and our\nservice provider, service integrator, or\n\n32\n00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.670\norganizations as we implement and\nas we evolve a SIAM eco system.\n\n33\n00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.100\nYou've also got to consider,\n\n34\n00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.600\nthat across the SIAM ecosystem, we need to\nencourage collaboration and cooperation.\n\n35\n00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.780\nAnd we need to encourage,\n\n36\n00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.380\ndefinitely the cross service provider\ncollaboration and cooperation as well.\n\n37\n00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.700\nBecause we're not just talking\nabout one service provider,\n\n38\n00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.440\nwe are talking about\nmany service providers.\n\n39\n00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.630\nSo what do you think that we actually\nmean by the term cultural change?\n\n40\n00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.890\nCultural change, so the respective set\nof values that maybe an organization or\n\n41\n00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.800\nthese respective organizations hold and\nhow the morph but\n\n42\n00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.100\nalso how they interface with each other.\n\n43\n00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.385\nWell we're talking about change,\nso don't forget that.\n\n44\n00:02:35.385 --> 00:02:39.425\nSo cultural change is not just about\nhow they interface with each other,\n\n45\n00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:40.975\nthat's the actual culture.\n\n46\n00:02:40.975 --> 00:02:45.702\nBut cultural change is about actually\nmoving to that particular point.\n\n47\n00:02:45.702 --> 00:02:49.422\nAnd with cultural change, what we're\ntalking about is transformational change.\n\n48\n00:02:49.422 --> 00:02:53.402\nWe're talking about the people\naspect of transformational change.\n\n49\n00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:58.562\nAnd a transformational change is any type\nof change that would be considered to\n\n50\n00:02:58.562 --> 00:03:01.410\nbe changing the organization.\n\n51\n00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.280\nSo you might consider this\nto be what we call OCM or\n\n52\n00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.110\norganizational change management.\n\n53\n00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.930\nIn organizational change management,\nyou have to consider the people.\n\n54\n00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.420\nQuite often we concentrate on\nthings like the processes.\n\n55\n00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.930\nAnd we concentrate on the I\nlike to call it the admin.\n\n56\n00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.000\nWe concentrate on defining processes.\n\n57\n00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.060\nWe concentrate on ensuring we've got\nthe right level of documentation.\n\n58\n00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.620\nAnd ensuring that we've got\nall the contracts in place.\n\n59\n00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.630\nBut then,\nwe discussed in a previous episode,\n\n60\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.750\nthen if we take our agile principles,\n\n61\n00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.310\nthen we value collaboration over\nthose contractual commitments.\n\n62\n00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.790\nBecause those contractual commitments,\nwell if we start sticking to all of\n\n63\n00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.010\nthe wording that's in that documentation\nthat we've spent so much time developing.\n\n64\n00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.020\nThen we miss the collaborative aspect.\n\n65\n00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.970\nWe miss the people aspect.\n\n66\n00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:02.471\nAnd we miss the fact that sometimes two\npeople just simply don't get along.\n\n67\n00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:03.531\nAnd sometimes,\n\n68\n00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:07.697\nif you've got one particular\nperson that has made a suggestion,\n\n69\n00:04:07.697 --> 00:04:12.925\nno matter what happens, there's gonna\nbe one person that doesn't particularly\n\n70\n00:04:12.925 --> 00:04:18.326\nlike that suggestion no matter how good a\nsuggestion it may be for the organization.\n\n71\n00:04:18.326 --> 00:04:24.670\nCultural change looks at the people aspect\nof managing transformational change.\n\n72\n00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.010\nSo we're moving through\nto the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n73\n00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.980\nAnd with cultural change, just even by\nsaying the words, we acknowledge that\n\n74\n00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.490\nwe've got to manage the people through\nthis transformation and through\n\n75\n00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.280\nthis evolution because without the people,\nit's simply not going to be successful.\n\n76\n00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.395\nDoes that make sense?\n&gt;&gt; That does make sense and\n\n77\n00:04:49.395 --> 00:04:53.905\nI felt like there might have been, I\n\n78\n00:04:53.905 --> 00:04:58.895\ndon't know what we were talking about,\nthe last two people\n\n79\n00:04:58.895 --> 00:05:02.783\nnot necessarily seeing eye to eye.\n&gt;&gt; I saw the side eye.\n\n80\n00:05:02.783 --> 00:05:04.129\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; But in all seriousness,\n\n81\n00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.073\nbeing able to manage\nthe difference between two people,\n\n82\n00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:08.835\nbetween groups of people.\n\n83\n00:05:08.835 --> 00:05:12.685\nAnd as you're kind of moving to\nthis multiple service provider.\n\n84\n00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.450\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of unavoidable, right?\n\n85\n00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.950\nYou're gonna have a cultural shift just\nby the nature that your organization is\n\n86\n00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.020\nchanging as a whole right?\n&gt;&gt; All you need is one simple incident\n\n87\n00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.270\nto have been passed to one particular\nservice provider, and that service\n\n88\n00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.530\nprovider to have deemed it not to be their\nincident or not their responsibility.\n\n89\n00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.370\nAnd if we don't have that collaboration\nin place then that's going to break down\n\n90\n00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.880\nthe relationship between\nthose two service providers.\n\n91\n00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.390\nAnd once that happens, it's very, very\ndifficult to build that back up again.\n\n92\n00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.340\nAnd so here we are in our\ncultural considerations aspect\n\n93\n00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.450\nlooking at the fact that people matter.\n\n94\n00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.840\nIt's as simple as that,\npeople really do matter.\n\n95\n00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.460\nAnd so we have as I've already said\nthe three aspects to the culture and\n\n96\n00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.690\none is the change but then the other\nis maintaining collaboration and\n\n97\n00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.630\nmaintaining that collaboration\nacross all of our service providers.\n\n98\n00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.650\nCuz ultimately what we\nwant to do is we want to\n\n99\n00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.950\ndeliver value to our customers and\nto our customer environment and\n\n100\n00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.000\nin order to do that,\nwe need to have the right people.\n\n101\n00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.770\nLet's take a look at some issues\nthat we have to resolve, and\n\n102\n00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.510\nhow to resolve those issues,\nstarting with that customer perspective.\n\n103\n00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.090\nSo from the customer perspective then,\n\n104\n00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.390\nwhat the customer actually\nwants to see Is value.\n\n105\n00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.300\nThat's really all they're interested in.\n\n106\n00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.470\nSo we have got to ensure that\nas a service integrator managing\n\n107\n00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.870\nthis evolution,\nthen it's invisible to the customer.\n\n108\n00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.390\nSo we've got to implement some form of\nOCM, organizational change management,\n\n109\n00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.840\nas I've already mentioned.\n\n110\n00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.980\nAnd that will allow us to manage\nthis cultural aspect of change.\n\n111\n00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.860\nEnsuring that we take\neverybody's viewpoints,\n\n112\n00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.320\nevery single stakeholder's\nopinions into account.\n\n113\n00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.010\nAnd that we identify\nsources of resistance so\n\n114\n00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.630\nwe're overcome those\nsources of resistance.\n\n115\n00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:14.070\nSo you might want to consider using\nan external consultancy to help with that.\n\n116\n00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.960\nWe also need to understand\nwhat capabilities are needed\n\n117\n00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.470\nwithin the customer organization.\n\n118\n00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.150\nAnd that may involve some training.\n\n119\n00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.580\nIt may involve identifying\nagain sources of resistance.\n\n120\n00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.880\nAnd that may involve, obviously,\nthe, well I was just gonna say,\n\n121\n00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.170\nthe selling of what's in it for me aspect.\n\n122\n00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.730\nThat's what we've got to do with any\norganizational change, by the way.\n\n123\n00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.750\nNo matter who your stakeholders are,\nyou have got to answer the question,\n\n124\n00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.550\nwhat's in it for me.\n\n125\n00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.414\nYou've got to create a need.\n\n126\n00:07:47.414 --> 00:07:50.274\nAnd we've got lots of\nepisodes within various\n\n127\n00:07:50.274 --> 00:07:52.923\nseries including within our ITIL series.\n\n128\n00:07:52.923 --> 00:07:56.054\nWhere we've actually looked at\norganizational change management.\n\n129\n00:07:56.054 --> 00:07:58.847\nIf we take a look at the ITIL\npractitioner series.\n\n130\n00:07:58.847 --> 00:08:03.024\nThat there are whole episodes on\norganizational change management and\n\n131\n00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:07.897\nthe use of things like Cotter's 8 Steps\nto Organizational Change Management that\n\n132\n00:08:07.897 --> 00:08:11.375\nlooks at creating a need,\ncreating a sense of urgency, and\n\n133\n00:08:11.375 --> 00:08:14.459\nthen answering questions\nlike what's in it for me?\n\n134\n00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:18.160\nAnd getting people on\nboard with the change.\n\n135\n00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.110\nAnd that's what we have to do\nfrom a customer perspective.\n\n136\n00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.631\nBut then also from the service integrator\nperspective, as you see on this particular\n\n137\n00:08:25.631 --> 00:08:29.165\nslide, we have got to ensure that\nwe've got governance in place.\n\n138\n00:08:29.165 --> 00:08:31.728\nAnd governance in JP Cotter's eight steps,\n\n139\n00:08:31.728 --> 00:08:36.190\nthen governance would be considered\nto be that guiding coalition.\n\n140\n00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.800\nSo having some leadership that\nwill drive the cultural change.\n\n141\n00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.890\nAnd then of course again, with the service\nintegrator and service providers,\n\n142\n00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.400\nwe again have to ensure that we've got\nthe governance aspect in place, but\n\n143\n00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.050\nthat also we're answering the question,\nwhat's in it for me?\n\n144\n00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:58.540\nThat means communication, and as far\nas the service providers are concerned,\n\n145\n00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.580\nwell, the service providers\nare going to be working with\n\n146\n00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.560\nthat new environment, the new ecosystem.\n\n147\n00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.000\nAnd again, we have to answer\nthe questions what's in it for me?\n\n148\n00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:16.600\nAnd so, of course if we go back, and we go\nback to our other cultural considerations.\n\n149\n00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.510\nWe've looked at organizational\nchange management and\n\n150\n00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.770\nagain we've looked at this\nfrom a very high level.\n\n151\n00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.080\nBut I just wanna draw your attention\nto the fact that we are in our\n\n152\n00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:30.540\nfoundation series and we don't need to\ngo too much in depth in this right now.\n\n153\n00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.820\nBut we do go into depth when we look at,\nif we go to ITIL Practitioner,\n\n154\n00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.190\nthat particular series, or another\nseries where we look specifically at\n\n155\n00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.530\norganizational change\nmanagement within IT.\n\n156\n00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.420\nSo then let's think about all\nthe considerations that we've got.\n\n157\n00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.190\nCollaboration, what do you\nthink's key to collaboration,\n\n158\n00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.890\nJustin?\n&gt;&gt; I think compromise.\n\n159\n00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:52.750\n&gt;&gt; Compromise?\n\n160\n00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would think compromise,\n\n161\n00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.100\nat least on respective view points.\n\n162\n00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.670\nOr to some extent, what do I mean?\n\n163\n00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:04.016\nMaybe listening skills, right, instead\nof being, no, you're wrong, accusatory,\n\n164\n00:10:04.016 --> 00:10:08.722\nthose type things, being able to listen,\ntake someone's perspective, and\n\n165\n00:10:08.722 --> 00:10:12.596\nmore or less synthesize that into\na plan of action, so to speak.\n\n166\n00:10:12.596 --> 00:10:13.233\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n167\n00:10:13.233 --> 00:10:15.470\nI like that you said the word compromise.\n\n168\n00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.297\nWe like the use of the word cooperation,\nwe've got cooperation here,\n\n169\n00:10:19.297 --> 00:10:22.392\nwe've got the collaboration and\ngetting along with each other.\n\n170\n00:10:22.392 --> 00:10:27.512\nAnd so, and we've said this in an earlier\nepisode as well, it's accepting\n\n171\n00:10:27.512 --> 00:10:33.117\nthat we're not looking to point fingers,\nwe're not looking to apportion blame.\n\n172\n00:10:33.117 --> 00:10:38.120\nAnd whatever challenges that we may come\nacross, we're doing it together as a team.\n\n173\n00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.282\nNow, I don't want that\nto come across as just,\n\n174\n00:10:42.282 --> 00:10:46.038\nI don't know, cliched, which it can do.\n\n175\n00:10:46.038 --> 00:10:51.730\nBut if we all acknowledge that we're all\ntrying to achieve value to the customer,\n\n176\n00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.783\nand we're trying to do that collectively,\n\n177\n00:10:54.783 --> 00:11:00.000\nthen we should be able to achieve that\ncollaboration to its optimum level.\n\n178\n00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.870\nWe've got to think about Lean.\n\n179\n00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:08.280\nWe've got to ensure that we are able\nto work with minimal waste.\n\n180\n00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.880\nWe've gotta deliver effective value but\nwe've got to deliver it efficiently.\n\n181\n00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.532\nAnd so therefore we've got\nto consider the customer,\n\n182\n00:11:18.532 --> 00:11:21.350\nthey have to be the number one priority.\n\n183\n00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:27.170\nAnd therefore we have to ensure that the\nway that we work is designed to deliver\n\n184\n00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:32.320\nvalue to our customer from\nthe service provider's perspective.\n\n185\n00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:38.180\nWe have to have some sense of\ngovernance because, remember,\n\n186\n00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.245\nwe've got multiple service providers.\n\n187\n00:11:40.245 --> 00:11:45.130\nAnd so there has to be somebody at that\nservice integrator layer that takes\n\n188\n00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:50.570\nthat accountability for\nensuring that collaboration takes place.\n\n189\n00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.230\nAnd again, think about\norganizational change management.\n\n190\n00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:58.220\nAnd once those principles of change\nmanagement may, you may think,\n\n191\n00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.730\njust apply to the change and\njust to the implementation.\n\n192\n00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:02.940\nBut those principles for\n\n193\n00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.430\norganizational change management\nabsolutely apply to everything.\n\n194\n00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.590\nAnd those principles\nare creating a sense of urgency.\n\n195\n00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:16.350\nAnd also, that communication, answering\nthe question of what's in it for me?\n\n196\n00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:20.950\nUltimately, what we want is\nan environment that is completely focused\n\n197\n00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.370\non outcomes to the organization.\n\n198\n00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.030\nAnd, not outcomes for\nthe service provider,\n\n199\n00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:31.910\nbut outcomes to the organization.\n&gt;&gt; Now, Jo,\n\n200\n00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:35.470\nwe keep saying what's in it for me, right?\n\n201\n00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:36.990\nSo I wanna drive this.\n\n202\n00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.980\nI can't help but think of an, admittedly\nso, kind of a colloquial saying,\n\n203\n00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.720\nyou'll draw more flies with honey\nthan you will with vinegar.\n\n204\n00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.830\nBut I wanna make sure we're not\njust talking about soothsaying.\n\n205\n00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.790\nWe're not saying I'm going to make\nyou promises just to say okay,\n\n206\n00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.930\nwell, this is what you're going to get.\n\n207\n00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:56.050\nYou should be upfront and transparent,\nbut also help them see the value,\n\n208\n00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.310\nlike collaboration.\n\n209\n00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:00.069\nI know some people, when they hear\ncollaboration they think man,\n\n210\n00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:01.990\na bunch of bureaucratic red tape.\n\n211\n00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.090\nIt's now going to take me all kinds\nof stuff because I have to work with\n\n212\n00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.080\nthese people.\n\n213\n00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.090\nBut really your goal should be to kind\nof morph that viewpoint to where no,\n\n214\n00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.010\nthis is actually gonna make us better,\nthis is more quality,\n\n215\n00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:18.390\nthis is being more effective, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right and in fact I like what you said,\n\n216\n00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.335\nand I've never heard that\nparticular phrase before,\n\n217\n00:13:22.335 --> 00:13:27.200\n[LAUGH] I think we talk about carrots and\nsticks back in England.\n\n218\n00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.210\nYou get more cooperation with\na carrot rather than a stick.\n\n219\n00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.060\nI don't know.\nI don't know why we think about donkeys\n\n220\n00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.640\nand you think about flies or bees.\n\n221\n00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.565\nI'm not too sure.\n&gt;&gt; And I think this highlights cultural\n\n222\n00:13:38.565 --> 00:13:39.580\ndifferences.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n223\n00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.645\n&gt;&gt; But not in quite the culture that we're\n\n224\n00:13:40.645 --> 00:13:43.010\ntalking about there, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n225\n00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:46.390\nBut ultimately the one thing that we\ndon't want to do is get ourselves\n\n226\n00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.090\ntoo bogged down.\n\n227\n00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:50.380\nAnd I mentioned it right at\nthe very beginning of this episode.\n\n228\n00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:55.104\nWe don't wanna get ourselves too bogged\ndown in contractual agreements and\n\n229\n00:13:55.104 --> 00:13:59.777\nin service-level targets and\nservice SLAs, service level agreements.\n\n230\n00:13:59.777 --> 00:14:06.547\nBecause if we start to contractualize\neverything then what you get is a group\n\n231\n00:14:06.547 --> 00:14:12.530\nof service providers that will\nwant to work to the contract.\n\n232\n00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.050\nAnd they will not want\nto be collaborative.\n\n233\n00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.990\nThey will not want to be flexible.\n\n234\n00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:22.129\nThink about what we said earlier on in\na previous episode about the fact that if,\n\n235\n00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:25.900\nat this level in the customer,\nthey've got an incident.\n\n236\n00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.015\nAnd they've reported it to the service\nintegrator, who's at this level.\n\n237\n00:14:29.015 --> 00:14:31.882\nThere's four hours on that\nservice level target,\n\n238\n00:14:31.882 --> 00:14:36.028\nwhich means that we've got four hours\nto do absolutely everything here.\n\n239\n00:14:36.028 --> 00:14:40.478\nAnd if one service provider gets hold of\nthe incident and they spend three hours,\n\n240\n00:14:40.478 --> 00:14:43.030\nthen the remaining service\nproviders can only\n\n241\n00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.030\nspend a few minutes looking at it each.\n\n242\n00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.471\nSo we have to have that\nlevel of collaboration.\n\n243\n00:14:49.471 --> 00:14:53.070\nIf you try and\nenforce rigid contracts, and\n\n244\n00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:58.224\nservice level agreements, and\nOLAs then what will happen is,\n\n245\n00:14:58.224 --> 00:15:02.710\nit will get down to this\nparticular service provider.\n\n246\n00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.100\nAnd they'll have it for three hours, but\n\n247\n00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.650\nthen the next one won't see it for\nthree hours, and the next one.\n\n248\n00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.681\nBy which time the service level\nagreement that you had here,\n\n249\n00:15:09.681 --> 00:15:12.068\nthat service level target gone,\nabsolutely.\n\n250\n00:15:12.068 --> 00:15:14.859\nAnd you've got no way\nof getting that back,\n\n251\n00:15:14.859 --> 00:15:18.340\nthat's a breach of that\nservice level target.\n\n252\n00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.800\nSo we want to enforce collaboration.\n\n253\n00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:27.510\nAnd I guess, really, the warning that I\nwould give to everybody would be not to\n\n254\n00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:33.320\nenforce contracts,\nnot to tie the contracts\n\n255\n00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.380\ndown to the point where nobody wants\nto step outside the contracts.\n\n256\n00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:41.080\nWe're not telling you that you just\njust ignore your contracts completely.\n\n257\n00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.591\nBut we are going back to those Agile\nprinciples that we looked at in previous\n\n258\n00:15:45.591 --> 00:15:49.257\nepisodes where we looked at\ncollaboration over contracts.\n\n259\n00:15:49.257 --> 00:15:52.782\nBecause if you have contracts\nthat are set in stone and\n\n260\n00:15:52.782 --> 00:15:57.499\nthat are completely inflexible,\nit doesn't induce collaboration.\n\n261\n00:15:57.499 --> 00:16:01.064\nWhat it can also do,\nit can have a detrimental effect.\n\n262\n00:16:01.064 --> 00:16:07.761\nAnd it can also, well, nurture an\nenvironment of finger pointing and blame,\n\n263\n00:16:07.761 --> 00:16:14.770\nand an environment where we end up\nconducting postmortems to apportion blame.\n\n264\n00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:18.550\nAnd to identify what went wrong just for\nthe sole purpose\n\n265\n00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:23.690\nof implementing a penalty, for instance,\nand that's not what we want to do.\n\n266\n00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:28.190\nWe have to remember that\nwe are dealing with\n\n267\n00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:32.630\nan environment that is what we\ncall cross-service provider.\n\n268\n00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:36.468\nAnd in fact, we've got a slide here,\nif we take a look, and it just\n\n269\n00:16:36.468 --> 00:16:41.271\nsimply tells us that a cross-service\nprovider organization requires our service\n\n270\n00:16:41.271 --> 00:16:45.410\nproviders to have appropriate\nbehaviors and appropriate attitudes.\n\n271\n00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:48.660\nWe call it the ABC of ICT.\n\n272\n00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.960\nABC means attitude, behavior, and culture.\n\n273\n00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.310\nIt's as simple as that, and\n\n274\n00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:58.570\nwe have to have the right behavior\nacross all of our service providers.\n\n275\n00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.480\nThat can be really,\nreally interesting, actually, and\n\n276\n00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:06.790\nthis is something that we could talk,\nfor hours, about this particular aspect.\n\n277\n00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:10.890\nAnd in fact, in other series,\nwe do talk for hours about this.\n\n278\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:16.950\nBut when you consider the culture of\nyour service provider organizations,\n\n279\n00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:22.130\nwe've got potentially 12 different service\nprovider organizations, maybe more.\n\n280\n00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:23.870\nThis is just an example.\n\n281\n00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:27.770\nAnd if you are to consider that every\nsingle service provider may even be\n\n282\n00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:32.966\nlocated in a different country, or maybe\nin a different part of the same country,\n\n283\n00:17:32.966 --> 00:17:36.300\nthen think about the cultural\ndifferences that exist.\n\n284\n00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:42.220\nThink about the real physical cultural\ndifferences that exist in your country and\n\n285\n00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.970\nin your organization.\n\n286\n00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.980\nI mean, look at the cultural\ndiversity that we have here.\n\n287\n00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.245\nI mean, you've got Justin and I together.\n\n288\n00:17:49.245 --> 00:17:53.730\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You do, and we have some common ground,\n\n289\n00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.100\nbut we come from different places.\n\n290\n00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.890\nAnd now we're getting to the point to\nwhere not only are we talking about\n\n291\n00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:02.470\ncorporate or company culture, but we're\nalso talking about people's culture, for\n\n292\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:06.680\nrespective countries, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right, this is really important.\n\n293\n00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.156\nAnd so this is something\nthat we have to overcome in\n\n294\n00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:15.120\norder to have an effective SIAM ecosystem.\n\n295\n00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.240\nSo let's just take a minute just to\nwork out a few simple things that we\n\n296\n00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.360\nhave to implement in order to\novercome the cultural differences\n\n297\n00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.470\nthat we have within organizations and\nacross service providers.\n\n298\n00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:30.970\nLet's just take a second.\n\n299\n00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.600\nWould you say that we\ntalk the same language?\n\n300\n00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.270\n&gt;&gt; I would say we both speak English, but\n\n301\n00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:39.170\nwe have different dialects of English.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we both speak English.\n\n302\n00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.582\nSo you've got a test coming up,\nhaven't you,\n\n303\n00:18:42.582 --> 00:18:46.169\nyeah, right at the end of this, right?\n&gt;&gt; That's what you keep telling\n\n304\n00:18:46.169 --> 00:18:48.642\nme [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you know all these notes that\n\n305\n00:18:48.642 --> 00:18:52.540\nyou've been taking?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n306\n00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.240\n&gt;&gt; Right, well,\n\n307\n00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.810\nwhen we finish recording,\nI'm gonna ask you to go away and\n\n308\n00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:59.910\nrevise them.\n&gt;&gt; I don't want to write them again.\n\n309\n00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.240\n&gt;&gt; I didn't say that.\n\n310\n00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.410\n&gt;&gt; That's what revise means.\n\n311\n00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.050\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not,\n\n312\n00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:08.528\nrevise means to study.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n313\n00:19:08.528 --> 00:19:10.852\n&gt;&gt; There are two dictionary definitions of\n\n314\n00:19:10.852 --> 00:19:12.140\nthe word revise.\n\n315\n00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:17.060\nOne means to study, and\none means to rewrite.\n\n316\n00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.496\nEssentially, it means revise, look again.\n\n317\n00:19:19.496 --> 00:19:23.580\nBut nevertheless,\nthere are two dictionary definitions, and\n\n318\n00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.450\nin your culture,\nyou take one definition as the standard.\n\n319\n00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:31.660\nIn my culture, we'll take another,\nand we have revision notes,\n\n320\n00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:36.810\nwhich is basically a study guide,\nbut we call it a revision guide.\n\n321\n00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:40.150\nAnd so we encourage students\nto go away and revise.\n\n322\n00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.270\nWe don't encourage them to go away and\nstudy.\n\n323\n00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.045\nWe say go away and revise.\n\n324\n00:19:44.045 --> 00:19:48.770\nNow, okay,\nthat might sound like it's fairly trivial,\n\n325\n00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:53.110\nuntil you realize that if I sent\nthat in an email to Justin.\n\n326\n00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.100\nAnd then I'd said to him,\nat the bottom of this email,\n\n327\n00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:59.865\nlet me know if you don't understand,\nor tell me if you understand.\n\n328\n00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:02.230\nJustin's gonna come back to me and\nhe's gonna say, yeah, sure,\n\n329\n00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.430\nI understand what you mean.\n\n330\n00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:08.272\nHe's gonna think horrible things about me,\nbecause, in his eyes,\n\n331\n00:20:08.272 --> 00:20:12.100\nI've asked him to do something that\nclearly is gonna take a long time.\n\n332\n00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:17.210\nBut nevertheless, he's gonna say to me,\nyeah, I understand, sure.\n\n333\n00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.019\nBut then the next day,\nwhat he's going to give to me is gonna be\n\n334\n00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:23.890\ncompletely different to\nwhat I am expecting.\n\n335\n00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:29.240\nBecause despite the fact that we both\nunderstood the words that were being used,\n\n336\n00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.580\nwe both had different\nmeaning to those words.\n\n337\n00:20:34.038 --> 00:20:38.970\nSo we've gotta think about things like\nlanguage when it comes to communication.\n\n338\n00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:43.980\nAnd in the previous slide, we mentioned\neffective communication principles.\n\n339\n00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.620\nEffective communication is key.\n\n340\n00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:51.240\nYou have to communicate in the language of\nyour audience, so you have to know what\n\n341\n00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:56.160\nlanguage they communicate in, and it might\nknow necessarily be the same as yours.\n\n342\n00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.190\nBut then let's think about other cultures.\n\n343\n00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:02.713\nThere are certain cultures around\nthe world where it would be considered\n\n344\n00:21:02.713 --> 00:21:04.349\ndisrespectful to say no.\n\n345\n00:21:04.349 --> 00:21:11.062\nDo you know how many projects,\nhow many IT projects I have seen failing,\n\n346\n00:21:11.062 --> 00:21:15.354\nthat have failed,\nwhen millions of dollars or\n\n347\n00:21:15.354 --> 00:21:20.210\npounds have been wasted\nbecause of one simple word?\n\n348\n00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:26.820\nBecause a developer is\nlocated in a culture\n\n349\n00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:32.660\nwhere the word no is considered\nto be disrespectful.\n\n350\n00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:37.530\nAnd so when you ask that developer, have\nyou done something, they will say, yes,\n\n351\n00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:41.600\nI have, when what they actually mean is,\nokay, I'll do it right now.\n\n352\n00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:45.400\nBut because they didn't\nwanna use the word no,\n\n353\n00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.020\nthen that project manager has gone on\nto assign a task to somebody else,\n\n354\n00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:54.880\nnot realizing that the first task\nis still actually being developed.\n\n355\n00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:00.530\nCulture can cause a lot\n\n356\n00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:05.060\nof issues if you're not aware\nof the cultural differences.\n\n357\n00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.820\nAnd that's not just the cultural\ndifferences between countries,\n\n358\n00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:12.440\nit's the cultural differences\nbetween organizations as well.\n\n359\n00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.690\nWhen you have different organizations,\nlet's say, for\n\n360\n00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:20.930\ninstance, some organizations\nwill insist on recycling\n\n361\n00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:26.300\na lot of their material and\na lot of their hardware, for instance.\n\n362\n00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.190\nOkay, in some countries, it's the law.\n\n363\n00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:32.645\nYou have to recycle your hardware,\nbut other organizations may not.\n\n364\n00:22:32.645 --> 00:22:35.675\nSo if you've got a service integrator\n\n365\n00:22:35.675 --> 00:22:39.125\nwhere it's their culture\nto always recycle hardware.\n\n366\n00:22:39.125 --> 00:22:43.416\nBut only half of the service providers\nwould do this, and the other half don't\n\n367\n00:22:43.416 --> 00:22:46.876\nrecycle their hardware,\nthen we have to then make a decision.\n\n368\n00:22:46.876 --> 00:22:51.474\nThere has to be some form of\ngovernance that says, okay, for\n\n369\n00:22:51.474 --> 00:22:54.179\nthis particular piece of work, for\n\n370\n00:22:54.179 --> 00:22:58.880\nthis particular ecosystem,\nthis is what we're going to do.\n\n371\n00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:06.560\nConsidering the culture is important,\nreally important.\n\n372\n00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:11.980\nAnd in fact, if you don't, then what's\ngoing to happen is you're going to have,\n\n373\n00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:17.980\nwell, not so much an ecosystem, but\nchaos, and that's what you don't want.\n\n374\n00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:24.020\nAnd it doesn't matter how efficient you\nhave managed to define your processes,\n\n375\n00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:30.460\nit doesn't matter how many models you\nmay implement for your processes.\n\n376\n00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.240\nAnd it doesn't matter how much\ndocumentation that you have and\n\n377\n00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.300\nhow much training that you've done.\n\n378\n00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.730\nBut if you don't consider\norganizational change management and\n\n379\n00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:43.410\nyou don't consider culture,\nthen unfortunately,\n\n380\n00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:49.690\nthe SIAM ecosystem itself is not going to\nfunction in a particularly efficient way.\n\n381\n00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:52.917\nAnd what you're going to have is,\npotentially, chaos.\n\n382\n00:23:52.917 --> 00:23:53.608\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jo,\n\n383\n00:23:53.608 --> 00:23:56.179\nsometimes this gets a little iffy, right?\n\n384\n00:23:56.179 --> 00:23:58.453\nWe can have a mismatch of expectations, or\n\n385\n00:23:58.453 --> 00:24:02.574\neven some of the most subtle behaviors\nthat That we think are normal for ours.\n\n386\n00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:04.500\nI'll give you an alternative perspective.\n\n387\n00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:09.150\nWhere I'm from, you make eye contact\nwith anybody who's speaking to you,\n\n388\n00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.650\nlike hard eye contact.\n\n389\n00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.915\nIn some cultures that's\nconsidered disrespectful or\n\n390\n00:24:13.915 --> 00:24:18.455\naggressive, which is odd because I found\nthis out through the hard way because\n\n391\n00:24:18.455 --> 00:24:20.475\npeople were telling me I was\nmaking them uncomfortable.\n\n392\n00:24:20.475 --> 00:24:23.685\nAnd I was, what?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You make me uncomfortable\n\n393\n00:24:23.685 --> 00:24:25.935\nevery day, Justin.\n&gt;&gt; That might be another story, but\n\n394\n00:24:25.935 --> 00:24:31.735\nthey told me that my direct hard eye\ncontact where they're from was kind\n\n395\n00:24:31.735 --> 00:24:32.985\nof like a machismo.\n\n396\n00:24:32.985 --> 00:24:35.290\nAnd I was like,\nthat's kind of odd, that's not,\n\n397\n00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:39.480\nit was considered disrespectful to break\neye contact when someone's speaking.\n\n398\n00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:43.280\nSo sometimes there are subtleties,\nand to some extent just be clear,\n\n399\n00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:48.070\nright, just reach out and\nmake sure we have a level footing.\n\n400\n00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:51.320\nI notice something that's gone wrong,\ntry to read people,\n\n401\n00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:55.090\nbe aware of these things.\n&gt;&gt; Ultimately the customer is king.\n\n402\n00:24:55.090 --> 00:25:00.450\nAnd ultimately you are there to\ndeliver value to the customer.\n\n403\n00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:04.790\nAnd so as a service integrator you\nhave an accountability to ensure that\n\n404\n00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:08.380\nany cultural differences that exist\nat this level are ironed out and\n\n405\n00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:12.350\nthat they're resolved and\nthat they remain resolved.\n\n406\n00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:15.120\nAnd that those relationships\nare maintained\n\n407\n00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.350\nthroughout the entire ecosystem.\n\n408\n00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:21.680\nThey're not just resolved and somebody's\nnot just paying what we'd call lip service\n\n409\n00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.690\nto it and saying yeah, yeah, yeah, and\nthen going away and doing something else.\n\n410\n00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.970\nWe call them the people that say yes but\nthen do no.\n\n411\n00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:34.380\nAnd we've got to ensure that the service\nintegrator has all of that managed,\n\n412\n00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.650\nbecause ultimately it's what\nthe customer wants that's important.\n\n413\n00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:41.160\nThey're at that level, and\nit's what they require that's important.\n\n414\n00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.480\nAnd we all have to remember,\nin this ecosystem,\n\n415\n00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.420\nthat we've all got a part to play to\nprovide in value to the customer.\n\n416\n00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.770\nIt's not about what each\nindividual service provider wants,\n\n417\n00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.580\nit's about what the customer wants.\n\n418\n00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.220\nAnd sometimes that means that we've got to\n\n419\n00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.420\nwork in a slightly different\nway to what we consider normal.\n\n420\n00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.860\nOr maybe we have to use a slightly\ndifferent language to what we'd consider\n\n421\n00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:07.160\nnormal in order to be able to\nbe effective and efficient.\n\n422\n00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:12.290\nI mean I know everyday I have to go to the\ngas station instead of the petrol station.\n\n423\n00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:13.475\nBreaks my little heart-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n\n424\n00:26:13.475 --> 00:26:15.260\n&gt;&gt; But I have to do it in order to be\n\n425\n00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.753\nefficient.\n&gt;&gt; You know what, Jo,\n\n426\n00:26:16.753 --> 00:26:19.222\nyou might want to get your car checked\nout if you're going there every day.\n\n427\n00:26:19.222 --> 00:26:19.734\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n\n428\n00:26:19.734 --> 00:26:21.212\n&gt;&gt; Maybe just buy a little more gasoline\n\n429\n00:26:21.212 --> 00:26:24.404\nif you can.\n&gt;&gt; Or just slow down, maybe.\n\n430\n00:26:24.404 --> 00:26:26.860\n&gt;&gt; Take that right foot, pull it back,\n\n431\n00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:27.821\n[SOUND] I jest.\n\n432\n00:26:27.821 --> 00:26:32.250\nBut these are issues that can be\nnuanced that we need to be aware of.\n\n433\n00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.320\nAnd we've always talked about,\nthroughout this series,\n\n434\n00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.720\nabout the amount of complexity that can\nkind of crop up when dealing with these.\n\n435\n00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:43.172\nThe more I learn, the more I realize that\nthe service integrator level is a [SOUND].\n\n436\n00:26:43.172 --> 00:26:46.882\nTell you what, it gives me cold sweats\njust thinking about all the things that\n\n437\n00:26:46.882 --> 00:26:48.440\nthey have to accomplish.\n\n438\n00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.090\nAnd while speaking of accomplishing,\n\n439\n00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:55.650\nI think we've kind of wrapped up our\ndiscussion about culture, right.\n\n440\n00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:57.130\nAm I wrong, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Wait, no.\n\n441\n00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:58.120\nWe certainly have.\n\n442\n00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:02.200\nThere is more information available for\nyou to download that looks at\n\n443\n00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:07.120\nthis in a little bit more detail,\nshould we say.\n\n444\n00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:11.470\nBut certainly for our episode, yes,\nwe have definitely wrapped up this topic.\n\n445\n00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:17.200\nAnd when we come back in our next episode,\nwe are going to be looking at, well we're\n\n446\n00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.190\ngonna be starting a little miniseries\nwhere we're looking at the challenges and\n\n447\n00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:25.266\nrisks to the SIAM ecosystem.\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Challenges and risk, and\n\n448\n00:27:25.266 --> 00:27:27.063\nmy heart is racing already.\n\n449\n00:27:27.063 --> 00:27:31.380\nAnd well, you better come on racing back\nas we continue with SIAM foundation.\n\n450\n00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.460\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n451\n00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.650\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n452\n00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:37.580\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n453\n00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.288\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

00:00:10.391\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:10.391 --> 00:00:15.348\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of IT Pro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.071\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and\n\n6\n00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:19.890\nwe're coming back at you\nwith more SIAM foundation.\n\n7\n00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.640\nI feel like I have to say that just\nto make sure I don't put an s on it.\n\n8\n00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.262\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But,\n\n9\n00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:28.010\nwe're gonna be talking about\nchallenges and risk in this episode.\n\n10\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.630\nAnd, well,\nI have been challenging over this course\n\n11\n00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.090\nof episodes in this series but, I don't\nthink that's what we're gonna talk about.\n\n12\n00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.100\nLuckily, we have someone who does know\nwhat we are gonna be talking about.\n\n13\n00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.550\nMiss Jo Peacock,\nhow are you doing today Jo?\n\n14\n00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.130\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you Justin.\n\n15\n00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.820\nHow are you?\n\n16\n00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.220\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n17\n00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.600\nChallenges and risk, it seems like a\nfairly broad topic here, but I'm guessing\n\n18\n00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.970\ndue to the complexity of a SIAM ecosystem,\nthere's a lot to be considered, right?\n\n19\n00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.220\n&gt;&gt; Well, what we're really looking\nat in these particular episodes that\n\n20\n00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.230\nare coming up and it's not just this one\nepisode, we're gonna have a few episodes,\n\n21\n00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.750\nsort of another mini series\nreally within this series.\n\n22\n00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.970\nAnd, we're gonna be looking at both\nthe challenges that we have to overcome,\n\n23\n00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.700\njust general working practices\nto both implementing and\n\n24\n00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.210\nto run in the SIAM ecosystem, and\nwe're also going to look at the risks.\n\n25\n00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.500\nThese are the things that could actually\nharm the external factors that could harm\n\n26\n00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.830\nus in achieving an efficient and\neffective SIAM ecosystem because,\n\n27\n00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.690\nof course, we've got a lot of\ncomplexity with the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n28\n00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.860\nSo you know that we're going to\nhave to overcome some challenges,\n\n29\n00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.310\nyou know that we're going to\nhave to identify risks and\n\n30\n00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.500\nwe're gonna have to\nmitigate against the risks.\n\n31\n00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.730\nAnd you know that's one of the key things\nthat we've got to do right now is to\n\n32\n00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.550\nidentify the risks.\n\n33\n00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.110\nAnd so, what we are gonna do over\nthese next few episodes is we\n\n34\n00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.965\nare going to look at a number of risks\n\n35\n00:01:52.965 --> 00:01:59.830\nto the SIAM\n\n36\n00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.130\necosystem and to the evolution, to\nthe implementation of the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n37\n00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.740\nNow, we are also going to look at sort of\n\n38\n00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.850\nthe common ways of mitigating\nagainst these risks.\n\n39\n00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.520\nTrying to either prevent the risk from\nhappening or trying to ensure that\n\n40\n00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.350\nif it does happen, then we can minimize\nthe effect of that particular risk.\n\n41\n00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.060\nBut these are just sort of common risks.\n\n42\n00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.600\nThis is not the big all and end all.\n\n43\n00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.690\nThis is not a definitive list\nof risks they're not it,\n\n44\n00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.240\nthat's all there's going to happen.\n\n45\n00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.910\nWe have to be realistic because\nwith every SIAM ecosystem,\n\n46\n00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.750\nthe environment is gonna\nbe completely different.\n\n47\n00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.030\nThese service providers are going\nto be completely different and\n\n48\n00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.810\nthe service integrator and the customer\nis going to be completely different.\n\n49\n00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.990\nThere are no two ecosystems\nthat are the same.\n\n50\n00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.330\nAnd, therefore, the challenges are going\nto be unique to your environment.\n\n51\n00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.810\nThe risks are going to be\nunique to your environment.\n\n52\n00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.260\nSo once we can look at some common risks\nand we can look at common mitigation for\n\n53\n00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.590\nthese risks.\n\n54\n00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.650\nThere's no right or wrong here.\n\n55\n00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.390\nThese are just a guideline\nreally just to make you think.\n\n56\n00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.530\nAnd so what we're going to do is we're\njust gonna really take a brief look over\n\n57\n00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.027\nthe next few episodes at some of the risks\nand some of the challenges to building and\n\n58\n00:03:13.027 --> 00:03:16.590\nmaintaining a SIAM ecosystem.\n\n59\n00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.880\nSo, of course, a good place to start\nthen is with the business case, and\n\n60\n00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.250\nthe business case, well,\nthat's our justification for\n\n61\n00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.480\na significant item of expenditure.\n\n62\n00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.880\nIn other words,\nwe have to justify why we want to move\n\n63\n00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.040\nto a SIAM ecosystem because evolving to\nthe SIAM ecosystem is going to cost money.\n\n64\n00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.570\nWe have to consider implementing,\nemploying even a service integrator.\n\n65\n00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.230\nWe also have to consider implementing and\n\n66\n00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.150\ncontractual negotiations for\nour service providers.\n\n67\n00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.440\nThey may already be in place and\nwe discussed this previously in our\n\n68\n00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.200\nvery initial episodes here when\nwe started looking at SIAM.\n\n69\n00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.690\nAnd we also have to consider all\nof our service level targets and\n\n70\n00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.570\nthe service level agreements between\nthe service integrator and the customer.\n\n71\n00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.260\nSo ultimately,\n\n72\n00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.740\nthe first thing that we have to do when we\nhave realized that we want to move away\n\n73\n00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:24.300\nfrom the traditional model of the service\nprovider and functional areas.\n\n74\n00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.940\nAs we wanna move away from that model,\nthen we need to build a business case.\n\n75\n00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.398\nWho signs a business case Justin?\n\n76\n00:04:31.398 --> 00:04:34.930\n&gt;&gt; Way out of left field here.\n\n77\n00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.150\nWho signs the, I am guessing, wait\na minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n78\n00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.365\nLet me think, so we came up with this.\n\n79\n00:04:41.365 --> 00:04:41.876\n&gt;&gt; A person with a bunny?\n\n80\n00:04:41.876 --> 00:04:44.090\n&gt;&gt; A person with my customer?\n\n81\n00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.900\n&gt;&gt; Right yeah, yeah the customer\nis gonna sign our business case.\n\n82\n00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.970\nSo what do we wanna see\nin a business case?\n\n83\n00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.880\nWhat are the risks to the business case?\n\n84\n00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.440\nWell, let's take a look at the slides\nthat we've got here, and by the way,\n\n85\n00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.860\nall of these are available,\nthey're all downloadable for you.\n\n86\n00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.010\nSo what about if a customer\ndoesn't approve this?\n\n87\n00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.180\nThat is a risk, and\nultimately with that particular risk,\n\n88\n00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.610\ninvariably we've already started\nthat migration as we have\n\n89\n00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.080\ndefined the business case, as we have\nstarted to generate the business case.\n\n90\n00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.455\nAnd we've started to articulate\nthe return on investment\n\n91\n00:05:20.455 --> 00:05:22.260\nwe've probably already moved there.\n\n92\n00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.130\nWe've looked in previous episodes\nat the fact that we are now as\n\n93\n00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.240\nsort of an IT organization.\n\n94\n00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.440\nWe're moving more towards software\nas a service which means that\n\n95\n00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.410\nwe are moving to that ecosystem anyway.\n\n96\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.500\nIt's a natural evolution and so\n\n97\n00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.310\ncustomer organization executive if they\ndon't prove that move, then it's probably\n\n98\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.250\nbecause we haven't articulated it\nin a way that they understand.\n\n99\n00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.910\nRemember, the communication is\nin the language of the audience.\n\n100\n00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.980\nThis is a customer environment, I don't\nexpect them to know anything technical,\n\n101\n00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.370\nI don't expect them to be able to\nunderstand anything technical.\n\n102\n00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.550\nAnd, it's exactly the same\nwhere the organization,\n\n103\n00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.452\nthe customer approves it but,\nthen it doesn't allocate enough resources.\n\n104\n00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:13.053\nOr it doesn't allocate enough\nmoney to the evolution,\n\n105\n00:06:13.053 --> 00:06:18.270\nto the move to the implementation because,\nagain, they don't understand it.\n\n106\n00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.100\nWhat about when the customer\nstarts down this road, but\n\n107\n00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.580\nthen doesn't really understand what\nit is they're trying to achieve.\n\n108\n00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.220\nAnd so, therefore, we can't really\nsay whether we've achieved it or not.\n\n109\n00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.730\nWell, that's really simple.\n\n110\n00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.294\nThat is down to the fact that we\nhave not articulated our vision,\n\n111\n00:06:37.294 --> 00:06:41.945\nwe haven't set out our objectives,\nwe haven't said what we wanted to do.\n\n112\n00:06:41.945 --> 00:06:46.120\nAnd you have to do that because I think so\n\n113\n00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.700\nis not a good measure on its success or\ndo we think we've done that?\n\n114\n00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.690\nWell, our re-console, no,\nthat is not gonna cut it.\n\n115\n00:06:53.690 --> 00:07:00.970\nIf we're spending potentially thousands,\nmillions of dollars or pounds then well,\n\n116\n00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.430\nI think we did it is not going to be\na good enough measure of success, okay?\n\n117\n00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.980\nWe have to be able to articulate what\nit is we're trying to achieve and\n\n118\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.960\nthen we have to ensure that we can\ndemonstrate that we have achieved that.\n\n119\n00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.390\nAnd what about the costs\nbeing understated.\n\n120\n00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.117\nJustin, how many projects do you know that\nhave been delivered on time and on budget?\n\n121\n00:07:22.117 --> 00:07:24.798\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're funny.\n\n122\n00:07:24.798 --> 00:07:28.907\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say none that I know of,\n\n123\n00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:33.883\neither there's some kind of\nvariability in one of those two\n\n124\n00:07:33.883 --> 00:07:36.890\nfactors at minimum or both really.\n\n125\n00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.770\n&gt;&gt; The reason for that,\nI mean we can't always put the reason for\n\n126\n00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.720\nthat and we can't always put the blame,\nI don't know.\n\n127\n00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.560\nI can possibly blame the can always\ndo that with a project team.\n\n128\n00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.420\nIt's not always the project team.\n\n129\n00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.130\nA lot of times this is because either, and\n\n130\n00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.580\nthis is why Agile works so\nwell by the way.\n\n131\n00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.780\nBut a lot of times it's because\neither the goal post have changed.\n\n132\n00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.920\nIn other words, the deliverables\nhave changed which, again,\n\n133\n00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.410\nis why Agile works so well or\nit's because we simply didn't articulate\n\n134\n00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:09.510\nthe benefits or we didn't articulate\nhow much money we needed.\n\n135\n00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:14.450\nAnd in that instance then, we end up going\nover budget because it's either that or\n\n136\n00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.850\nwe stopped the project halfway\nthrough it's a life cycle.\n\n137\n00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:23.900\nSo what we have got to ensure that we\ndo is allocate right people to built\n\n138\n00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:29.710\nthe business case, and our articulative\nfrom the customers perspective.\n\n139\n00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:35.550\nSo articulative from the point of\nview of value to the customer.\n\n140\n00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:38.190\nAnd we've got to ensure\nthat all of the drivers,\n\n141\n00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.570\nall of those requirements are documented.\n\n142\n00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.890\nAnd that we can identify what suppliers,\n\n143\n00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.820\nwhat service providers we currently have,\nand why the contracts that we have with\n\n144\n00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.250\nthose service providers don't quite\nmeet up to our expectations right now.\n\n145\n00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.130\nBecause they are good candidates then for\n\n146\n00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.090\nmoving to a new contract\nas soon as possible.\n\n147\n00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.630\nBut in order to articulate\na return on the investment,\n\n148\n00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.061\nthen what we really should be\ndoing is doing our research.\n\n149\n00:09:08.061 --> 00:09:11.032\nI mentioned there about\nindustry benchmarks and\n\n150\n00:09:11.032 --> 00:09:15.670\ndocumenting the expected benefits but\nit's really about research.\n\n151\n00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:21.520\nIt's about identifying exactly\nwhat those benefits will be.\n\n152\n00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.770\nNow, I mentioned the word exactly.\n\n153\n00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:27.800\nIdentify and exactly, yeah,\nthat's gonna be a challenge.\n\n154\n00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:33.190\nI know that, but nevertheless,\nif we use not just industry benchmarks,\n\n155\n00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:37.970\nbut if we go to, and\nI'm gonna ask Justin again, I don't know.\n\n156\n00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.000\nI can't believe I'm asking this question.\n\n157\n00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where do you, Justin,\n\n158\n00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.770\nwhen you wanna find information?\n\n159\n00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.816\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you've watched the previous\nepisode, I ask my mother, but\n\n160\n00:09:46.816 --> 00:09:51.032\nif my mother doesn't know,\nthen I guess I'll peruse the Internet.\n\n161\n00:09:51.032 --> 00:09:51.707\n&gt;&gt; Dear.\n\n162\n00:09:51.707 --> 00:09:54.892\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Dear I can't believe what-\n\n163\n00:09:54.892 --> 00:09:55.487\n&gt;&gt; But in all-\n\n164\n00:09:55.487 --> 00:09:56.223\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n165\n00:09:56.223 --> 00:09:58.563\n&gt;&gt; We are just having a little bit of fun\n\n166\n00:09:58.563 --> 00:10:02.463\nthat is probably not a good\nmetric to research benchmarks or\n\n167\n00:10:02.463 --> 00:10:04.891\nparts of your business usefulness.\n\n168\n00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:09.913\n&gt;&gt; I don't know how much your mum knows,\nI mean, about IT I'm sure she is a very\n\n169\n00:10:09.913 --> 00:10:14.701\nintelligent lady and I'm sure she is\nvery clever, but I'm not sure that\n\n170\n00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:19.950\nshe really is exactly the fun of old\nknowledge when it comes to SIAM maybe.\n\n171\n00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.800\n&gt;&gt; Probably not, I mean, you've\nwatched me already a set of episodes\n\n172\n00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.491\nand-\n&gt;&gt; Well, okay.\n\n173\n00:10:24.491 --> 00:10:27.905\n&gt;&gt; And so, but-\n&gt;&gt; We go to Google, okay?\n\n174\n00:10:27.905 --> 00:10:28.561\nWe go to-\n&gt;&gt; We go to Google.\n\n175\n00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:29.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Or Bing.\n\n176\n00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.360\n&gt;&gt; Or Bing, yeah, yeah.\n\n177\n00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.530\nWe don't mind, Safari, we don't care, but\n\n178\n00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.750\nwhat we're going to do is we're\ngonna go to the Internet.\n\n179\n00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.850\nThe Internet is where we find all\nof our complementary information.\n\n180\n00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.960\nIt's where we find the answer\nto everything, isn't it Justin?\n\n181\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.057\nYes, just say yes.\n\n182\n00:10:46.057 --> 00:10:47.245\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is.\nShe keeps asking\n\n183\n00:10:47.245 --> 00:10:49.634\nme the same question\nexpecting different results.\n\n184\n00:10:49.634 --> 00:10:53.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, cuz I kind of hope\nit might have sunk in, I guess.\n\n185\n00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:54.490\nKind of hope.\n\n186\n00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.180\nI don't know, I give up.\n\n187\n00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.800\nNow, I give up.\n\n188\n00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.240\n[LAUGH] So yeah, we wanna go on,\nwe wanna look at the industry.\n\n189\n00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.260\nWe may actually ask maybe a consultant for\nsome advise a real consultant who\n\n190\n00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:12.938\nis able to provide that information or\neven Justin's mum, I guess.\n\n191\n00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:14.590\nSo what are the sort of challenges,\n\n192\n00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.770\nwhat other risks are there then\nto the SIAM ecosystem working?\n\n193\n00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.987\nMaybe I'll need to work with\nyour mum in our next show.\n\n194\n00:11:22.987 --> 00:11:25.235\n&gt;&gt; Maybe so,\nI think she would find that fun.\n\n195\n00:11:25.235 --> 00:11:29.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So let's take a look then\nat our level of control and ownership.\n\n196\n00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.410\nThis is the risk.\n\n197\n00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:36.520\nThis is actually quite an interesting\nrisk because we have spoken in previous\n\n198\n00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:43.140\nepisodes about the fact that we need\nto have control of our SIAM ecosystem.\n\n199\n00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:48.540\nBut we need to have the level\nof control that is appropriate\n\n200\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.340\nto be able to deliver\nvalue to the customer.\n\n201\n00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:58.750\nToo little control and you're not\ngonna get anything done, lets face it.\n\n202\n00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.710\nSo we need to have some processes.\n\n203\n00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.270\nWe need to have some documentation but\n\n204\n00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:10.630\ntoo much control, you're not gonna\nbe able to deliver value either.\n\n205\n00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:15.417\nBecause too much control then we get\nback to the service providers operating\n\n206\n00:12:15.417 --> 00:12:18.856\nto the exact terms and\nconditions of their contracts so\n\n207\n00:12:18.856 --> 00:12:22.310\nto their operational level agreements.\n\n208\n00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:28.220\nSo we've got to be incredibly careful as\nto the level of control that we exert.\n\n209\n00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.236\nYou come between bureaucratic but\n\n210\n00:12:31.236 --> 00:12:35.916\nyou have to have some level\nof organization in place.\n\n211\n00:12:35.916 --> 00:12:40.519\nAnd think about we have also talked\nabout data in previous episodes too,\n\n212\n00:12:40.519 --> 00:12:43.090\nthink about our data ownership as well.\n\n213\n00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.130\nSo if I am a customer and\n\n214\n00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.830\nI'm calling the service integrator\nbecause they are my service desk,\n\n215\n00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:55.446\nso they were that middle layer, and\nthat service integrator is external,\n\n216\n00:12:55.446 --> 00:12:59.780\nhow much information do I wanna\ngive that external person?\n\n217\n00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:02.582\nI'm not gonna give him any personal data,\nor am I?\n\n218\n00:13:02.582 --> 00:13:07.547\nBut I might have to, and then that\npersonal information they're gonna pass on\n\n219\n00:13:07.547 --> 00:13:12.814\npotentially to a service provider who may\npass it on to another service provider and\n\n220\n00:13:12.814 --> 00:13:16.030\nanother service provider\nwho owns the data.\n\n221\n00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:20.770\nIt's very simple for you to say, it's very\neasy to say but it's the customer's data,\n\n222\n00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.380\nthe customer owns the data.\n\n223\n00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:28.220\nBut what if that data is passed\non inadvertently to a service\n\n224\n00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:33.295\nprovider where we have not established\nclear ownership of data and\n\n225\n00:13:33.295 --> 00:13:39.115\nas far as they're concerned, any data\nthat's passed onto them is theirs?\n\n226\n00:13:39.115 --> 00:13:44.107\nAnd what if we do give ownership of our\ndata to somebody else, it sounds crazy but\n\n227\n00:13:44.107 --> 00:13:48.280\nwe might want to give it to\nsomebody else for them to manage.\n\n228\n00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.320\nAnd for them to take responsibility for\nbackups and for\n\n229\n00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.140\nthem to take responsibility for\nservice continuity or disaster recovery.\n\n230\n00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:00.964\nSo when you think about it like that, it's\nnot actually that crazy, however, again,\n\n231\n00:14:00.964 --> 00:14:05.830\nif you're handing over\nownership of data then you have\n\n232\n00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:10.520\nto be very, very careful about\nwhat happens with that data.\n\n233\n00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.380\nAnd that's when we get into the realms of\nwhat we ensure that it's in the contract,\n\n234\n00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.100\nbut, again,\nif we ensure that it's in the contract,\n\n235\n00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.730\nthen we go back to that point\nof that level of control.\n\n236\n00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:25.590\nIf we exert too much control, then we\nget that rigidity of the contract, and\n\n237\n00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:31.350\nwe get organizations to say no, this is in\nmy contract, this is what I'm going to do.\n\n238\n00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:36.620\nBut if we have our controls that\nare too flexible well, then we have no\n\n239\n00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.420\ncontrol over our data and our data could\nend up in the hands of somebody else.\n\n240\n00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.640\nIt's a dilemma.\n\n241\n00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.680\nBut actually, it's not just a dilemma,\nit's a balance.\n\n242\n00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.390\nIt's a balance that you have to get right.\n\n243\n00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.680\nAnd you have to get it right\nas per your organization.\n\n244\n00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.324\nYou know what your organization does,\nyou know what the customer does,\n\n245\n00:14:57.324 --> 00:14:59.248\nwhat their fundamental business is.\n\n246\n00:14:59.248 --> 00:15:01.790\nAnd you know the level of security and\n\n247\n00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:06.070\nthe level of integrity that\nthey require for their data.\n\n248\n00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:10.310\nAnd so you have to ensure that\nwhen implementing SIAM ecosystem,\n\n249\n00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:14.900\nthat we negotiate appropriate controls for\nthat data.\n\n250\n00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:19.650\nSo we have to make sure we've got a clear\nvision for the SIAM structure and\n\n251\n00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:20.700\nfor its governance.\n\n252\n00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:27.213\nAnd that the customer understands that\ngovernance is about strategic decisions\n\n253\n00:15:27.213 --> 00:15:32.219\nbut management is about the day-to-day\nmanagement of SIAM ecosystem and\n\n254\n00:15:32.219 --> 00:15:37.240\nwe have to ensure that a SIAM ecosystem\nis managed on a day-to-day basis.\n\n255\n00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:42.638\nAnd so that we've got policies that apply\nacross all of our services provider\n\n256\n00:15:42.638 --> 00:15:48.830\norganisations and that we've got ownership\nof our processes clearly defined.\n\n257\n00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:52.410\nAnd we wanna use those RACI\nmatrices that we talked about\n\n258\n00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.970\nin one of our early episodes\nto help us with this.\n\n259\n00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.680\nAnd then that brings me\non to legacy contracts.\n\n260\n00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.170\nLegacy contracts are contracts\nthat we have hard\n\n261\n00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:09.230\nprior to implementing the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n262\n00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.090\nAnd these contracts\nwill exist in surprise.\n\n263\n00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:17.220\nNow, these contracts may or\nmay not have clauses in them that\n\n264\n00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.950\nare not going to fit\nwithin the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n265\n00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:26.302\nWhat that mean is that service integrator\nhas more work to do because they've got\n\n266\n00:16:26.302 --> 00:16:28.510\nto manage those legacy contracts.\n\n267\n00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:33.280\nAnd, of course, the service level targets\nin those legacy contracts may not support\n\n268\n00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:39.010\nthe SIAM ecosystem or may not support\nthe new service level agreement.\n\n269\n00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:44.450\nSo we may have what we call gaps in\nservice or gaps in service level targets\n\n270\n00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:50.160\nand it make host more to\nrenegotiate those contracts.\n\n271\n00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.810\nSo what do we do?\n\n272\n00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:55.480\nWell, we have to first of all\nunderstand what contracts we have.\n\n273\n00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.000\nSo supply management is going\nto get involved in this,\n\n274\n00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.740\ncontract management should\nbe involved in this.\n\n275\n00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.701\nUnderstanding what existence\nsuppliers we have and\n\n276\n00:17:03.701 --> 00:17:06.330\nwhat contracts we have\nwith those suppliers.\n\n277\n00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:10.901\nAnd then, [COUGH] with these\nservice providers, these suppliers,\n\n278\n00:17:10.901 --> 00:17:15.791\nthen we have to explain, and\nwe have to get them on board, communicate,\n\n279\n00:17:15.791 --> 00:17:19.560\nthink about organizational\nchange management.\n\n280\n00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.490\nAnd we have to ensure that thy understand\nwhat it is that we are trying to achieve.\n\n281\n00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:30.300\nAnd then identify the potential and\n\n282\n00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.920\nit is a potential for\nnegotiating, renegotiating,\n\n283\n00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:40.260\namending a contract and if necessary\nidentify the cost of termination and\n\n284\n00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:44.380\nfind out if we can terminate a contract.\n\n285\n00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.550\nAnd how much it's going to cost us and\nwhat we stand to lose.\n\n286\n00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:55.230\nThis has to be considered in order for us\nto plan and then build our SIAM ecosystem.\n\n287\n00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:59.810\nAnd we also have to have\nsome form of mechanism for\n\n288\n00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:03.630\nhow we deal with this on a standard basis.\n\n289\n00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.920\nUltimately, we're dealing\nwith service providers and\n\n290\n00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.530\nsome of these service providers\nare going to be external.\n\n291\n00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:16.550\nSo what we need to consider is how we\ndeal with those external providers.\n\n292\n00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:21.770\nNow, what we've looked at in this\nparticular episode is we've looked at\n\n293\n00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:22.900\nthree challenges.\n\n294\n00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.690\nWe've looked at the legacy contracts,\nwe've looked at our business case,\n\n295\n00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:30.970\nand we've also looked at the challenge\nof ownership of our data and\n\n296\n00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:35.530\nthe challenge of management and\nleadership as well in governance.\n\n297\n00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:39.340\nSo when we come back in our next episode,\nwe're gonna continue\n\n298\n00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.510\nwith this particular theme and\nwe're going to look at challenges and\n\n299\n00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:48.060\nrisk to do with sort of commercial\nchallenges and cultural challenges also.\n\n300\n00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.920\nWhich, of course, we've already\nsort of dipped our toe in the water\n\n301\n00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.610\non cultural challenges\non a previous episode.\n\n302\n00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.190\nSo, I am hoping to see you back\n\n303\n00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.930\nin our next episode where we'll talk\nabout more of our cultural challenges.\n\n304\n00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:04.366\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jo, you've already got me\njuggling a working chainsaw and, I guess,\n\n305\n00:19:04.366 --> 00:19:07.002\nmaybe a bear cat or\nsomething, I don't know.\n\n306\n00:19:07.002 --> 00:19:07.628\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n307\n00:19:07.628 --> 00:19:09.810\nthere is a lot to unpack here, right?\n\n308\n00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.037\nThose these nice little chunks and\n\n309\n00:19:12.037 --> 00:19:17.160\nyou wouldn't name a thing that data\nhas that many risks or challenges.\n\n310\n00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.030\nWell, there is a lot going there.\n\n311\n00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:22.660\nSo, definitely, join us on back cuz we're\ngonna continue on in a part two looking at\n\n312\n00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.540\nchallenges and risks, but for now we're\ngonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n313\n00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.480\nSigning off for IT Pro.TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison\n\n314\n00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.360\n&gt;&gt; And, I'm Jo Peacock,\n\n315\n00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:29.979\n&gt;&gt; And, we'll see you next time.\n\n316\n00:19:29.979

watching\n\n3\n00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:13.030\nITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.510\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.751\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and we're\ncoming back at you with a part two of\n\n6\n00:00:19.751 --> 00:00:24.200\nlooking at challenges and risk and this\nis part of our SIAM foundation a series.\n\n7\n00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.581\nWell, here to help us along to further\nexpand on challenges and risks Mrs.\n\n8\n00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:29.360\nJo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.626\nHow you doing today Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, great.\n\n10\n00:00:30.626 --> 00:00:33.577\nJustin, how are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic as well and\n\n11\n00:00:33.577 --> 00:00:37.790\nyou said in the last episode that we're\nactually going to be taking a look\n\n12\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.207\na little bit at cultural, these risks and\n\n13\n00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:43.200\nchallenges that we can\nexperience due to culture.\n\n14\n00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.457\nWhat else are we gonna be talking about?\n&gt;&gt; Well, in a previous episode,\n\n15\n00:00:46.457 --> 00:00:51.187\nwe actually did take a look at culture and\nwe took a look at organizational change\n\n16\n00:00:51.187 --> 00:00:55.355\nmanagement and the fact that we have\nto accommodate for all culture and\n\n17\n00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:58.274\ncultural change,\nwhenever we implement SIAM.\n\n18\n00:00:58.274 --> 00:01:03.570\nSo we're gonna look at just the risks\nthat are associated with not doing that.\n\n19\n00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.595\nWhat could happen if we don't perform\nany organizational change management?\n\n20\n00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:12.389\nAnd then after that,\nwe're also gonna look at behaviors and\n\n21\n00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:17.950\nwe're going to look at the interesting\nconcept of micromanagement.\n\n22\n00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.653\n&gt;&gt; That is a topic near and\n\n23\n00:01:18.653 --> 00:01:19.213\ndear to my heart.\n\n24\n00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:23.421\nI can't tell you how much I do love it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n25\n00:01:23.421 --> 00:01:25.093\n&gt;&gt; So I'm kind of interested that I'm\n\n26\n00:01:25.093 --> 00:01:28.092\nbeing facetious in case you can't tell.\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, you love it?\n\n27\n00:01:28.092 --> 00:01:30.576\n&gt;&gt; I'm interested to see what your take on\n\n28\n00:01:30.576 --> 00:01:32.848\nit is, but we have touched on code.\n\n29\n00:01:32.848 --> 00:01:35.210\nIs that where we're\nkinda meandering first?\n\n30\n00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.732\nIs to talk about challenges that\ncan crop up due to culture?\n\n31\n00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:40.367\n&gt;&gt; So in this particular episode,\n\n32\n00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:43.890\nwe're really gonna focus on the risks and\nthe challenges that come.\n\n33\n00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.491\nBecause what we call the ABC of IT,\nthe attitude, behavior and culture and\n\n34\n00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:51.277\nthat's what we're really going to look at.\n\n35\n00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:56.910\nAnd obviously, micromanaging\nis really a type of behavior.\n\n36\n00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.740\nBut we're gonna take\na look at these three.\n\n37\n00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.542\nSo the first thing I want to\ndo is I wanna really get and\n\n38\n00:02:02.542 --> 00:02:06.060\ndive straight in to\nlook at a cultural fit.\n\n39\n00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.537\nIn a previous episode,\nwe have looked at culture and\n\n40\n00:02:08.537 --> 00:02:11.929\nwe looked at organizational change\nmanagement as I've already said.\n\n41\n00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.309\nBut what happens if we don't get it right?\n\n42\n00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:20.360\nWhat happens if we miss the boat on\norganizational change management?\n\n43\n00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.496\nWhat is it gonna do to us?\n\n44\n00:02:21.496 --> 00:02:23.220\nWell, take a look.\n\n45\n00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.090\nAs service providers,\nwe take a look at our, yep.\n\n46\n00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.080\nAt our [LAUGH] I was just gonna say,\nhey, look at that.\n\n47\n00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.970\nSo essentially then,\n\n48\n00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.580\nwhat happens is that our service\nproviders just don't work well together.\n\n49\n00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.300\nBut is that a risk?\n\n50\n00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.309\nIs that a risk to our organization?\n\n51\n00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:46.390\nIs that a risk to the SIAM ecosystem?\n\n52\n00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.452\nWell, yes it is.\n\n53\n00:02:48.452 --> 00:02:51.874\nIf we don't perform\norganizational change management,\n\n54\n00:02:51.874 --> 00:02:54.469\nthen we would probably encourage the risk.\n\n55\n00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.279\nWe would probably be working toward\n\n56\n00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:01.690\nbuilding that risk rather\nthan mitigating against it.\n\n57\n00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.544\nNow, we've already looked in\nprevious episodes at contract and\n\n58\n00:03:07.544 --> 00:03:11.377\nthe fact that we value\ncollaboration over contract.\n\n59\n00:03:11.377 --> 00:03:14.809\nWell, if we don't gt\nthe right cultural fit,\n\n60\n00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:19.649\nif we don't address the cultural issues,\nwhat tends to happen is\n\n61\n00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:23.963\nthe service providers or\nservice integrators will try and\n\n62\n00:03:23.963 --> 00:03:29.480\nmitigate against a bad cultural fit\nby putting this into a contract.\n\n63\n00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.065\nAnd they will try and add clauses into\na contract to address the fact that\n\n64\n00:03:33.065 --> 00:03:37.609\nthere is no collaboration or maybe certain\nprocesses aren't working very efficiently,\n\n65\n00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.840\nbecause there's a lack of communication.\n\n66\n00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.588\nAnd so\nwe tend to then overcontractualize things.\n\n67\n00:03:44.588 --> 00:03:49.368\nWe tend to put clauses into our contracts\nand into our agreements that says,\n\n68\n00:03:49.368 --> 00:03:51.982\nyou must talk to this\nperson every hour and\n\n69\n00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:55.230\nthen we get into the realms\nthen of micromanaging.\n\n70\n00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.121\nAnd of course, this is why in\nthis particular episode, Justin,\n\n71\n00:03:59.121 --> 00:04:01.896\nI wanted to bring all of\nthose three together.\n\n72\n00:04:01.896 --> 00:04:05.028\nBecause to be honest,\nwhen we're talking about cultural fitting,\n\n73\n00:04:05.028 --> 00:04:08.847\nwhen we're talking about behaviors,\nwhen we're talking about micromanaging.\n\n74\n00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:14.060\nThe rule,\nit's what I would say in my terminology.\n\n75\n00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.066\nIt's sort of same meat\ndifferent gravy really.\n\n76\n00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:18.767\n&gt;&gt; I have never heard that one.\n\n77\n00:04:18.767 --> 00:04:21.450\nBut I can definitely\njump on board with it.\n\n78\n00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.930\nThen really, this is one of those\nthings where they kind of just all\n\n79\n00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.060\ncoallesce into a similar\nlike this is a thing.\n\n80\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.500\nDon't really have a word for it.\n\n81\n00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.599\nBut if you're trying to institute formally\ninstitute some kind of non-formal\n\n82\n00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:41.252\ninteraction and it's always gets weird,\nyou must talk to this person.\n\n83\n00:04:41.252 --> 00:04:45.619\nNow, this become weird ceremony\nthat is artificial and actually and\n\n84\n00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:49.681\nactually could cause,\nI've found it to cause, resentment and\n\n85\n00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:53.165\nI'm not talking from\nan organizational standpoint.\n\n86\n00:04:53.165 --> 00:04:54.053\nI'm just talking person to person.\n\n87\n00:04:54.053 --> 00:04:56.705\nI've had things like,\nyou must talk to this person.\n\n88\n00:04:57.757 --> 00:05:00.507\nThat's weird.\nBecause now instead of being friendly or\n\n89\n00:05:00.507 --> 00:05:05.107\nbeing cordial or being collaborative,\nit's hey, I'm here to talk to you.\n\n90\n00:05:05.107 --> 00:05:06.857\nBecause I have to,\ncuz this piece of paper says.\n\n91\n00:05:06.857 --> 00:05:09.988\nSo I see this as not\nnecessarily the greatest\n\n92\n00:05:09.988 --> 00:05:12.756\nidea.\n&gt;&gt; And this is what happens when we then\n\n93\n00:05:12.756 --> 00:05:17.037\ntry and we try, and put this into\nour service level agreements, and\n\n94\n00:05:17.037 --> 00:05:21.320\ninto our contracts as well is that\nyou must talk to this person.\n\n95\n00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.199\nSo I have got to talk\nto Justin every hour,\n\n96\n00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.546\nbecause it says in my contract that\nI've got to talk to Justin every hour.\n\n97\n00:05:26.546 --> 00:05:29.840\nBut what if I've got\nnothing to say to Justin?\n\n98\n00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.500\nI'm gonna to find that hard to believe,\ncuz Justin never has nothing to say back.\n\n99\n00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.300\nBut anyway,\nwhat if I've got nothing to say?\n\n100\n00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.516\nWhat if I don't have any updates?\n\n101\n00:05:38.516 --> 00:05:42.599\nIf I don't have any updates and\nI have got nothing to say,\n\n102\n00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.408\nthen that makes it incredibly rigid and\n\n103\n00:05:45.408 --> 00:05:51.690\nit also means that we're probably not\ngoing to have valuable conversation.\n\n104\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.844\nBecause I'm not gonna look forward\nto my conversation with Justin and\n\n105\n00:05:54.844 --> 00:05:57.472\nJustin is not going to look\nforward to his conversations.\n\n106\n00:05:57.472 --> 00:06:01.380\nSo really, it's about looking for\nthe right.\n\n107\n00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.470\nNow, I just changed the slide\nhere to look at the behaviors.\n\n108\n00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.317\nBecause if we don't get\nthe cultural fit right,\n\n109\n00:06:07.317 --> 00:06:11.067\nwe'll get our service providers\nthat aren't engaging fully or\n\n110\n00:06:11.067 --> 00:06:15.590\nmaybe we'll get one or more service\nproviders that aren't engaging fully.\n\n111\n00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.640\nWe might get a service integrator that's\ngot a bias into one particular service\n\n112\n00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:27.330\nprovider and against another\nparticular service provider.\n\n113\n00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.690\nAnd so we've gonna concern ourselves\nwith delivering value to the customer.\n\n114\n00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.187\nAnd if we're not working\nin a collaborative way,\n\n115\n00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:41.266\nif we're not working in a way that is\nencouraging that collaboration and\n\n116\n00:06:41.266 --> 00:06:46.428\nin a way where we have considered\nthe culture, then the service providers\n\n117\n00:06:46.428 --> 00:06:51.800\nthemselves won't present what we\nmight consider to be a united front.\n\n118\n00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.705\nBut ultimately,\n\n119\n00:06:52.705 --> 00:06:56.273\nwhat the customer will perceive is\nthrough that service integrated.\n\n120\n00:06:56.273 --> 00:07:03.553\nThey will perceive a disjointed service\nand they will also perceive a disjointed,\n\n121\n00:07:03.553 --> 00:07:08.140\nwell, response to any\nfailures in service as well.\n\n122\n00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.868\nAnd then what tends to happen in\nthat particular environment where we\n\n123\n00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:18.525\nare relying or where we are concerned\nabout culture where we have over\n\n124\n00:07:18.525 --> 00:07:21.498\ncontractualized our cultural behaviors,\n\n125\n00:07:21.498 --> 00:07:26.420\nthen what tends to happen is that we\ntend to rely on sort of key personnel.\n\n126\n00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.067\nSo we'll have that one person that we\nfound in every single organization and\n\n127\n00:07:31.067 --> 00:07:31.730\nthere is.\n\n128\n00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.345\nThere's one person in every\nsingle service provider, but\n\n129\n00:07:35.345 --> 00:07:37.826\nyou happen to know is a good person.\n\n130\n00:07:37.826 --> 00:07:39.590\nI'll talk to Justin.\n\n131\n00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.808\nJustin's okay, Justin will do that for me.\n\n132\n00:07:41.808 --> 00:07:44.290\nJustin will understand.\n\n133\n00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.843\nAnd therefore,\nall of the communication and\n\n134\n00:07:47.843 --> 00:07:53.079\nall of the collaboration tends to\ngo through a few key personnel and\n\n135\n00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:56.742\nwhat happens then when\nJustin's not around?\n\n136\n00:07:56.742 --> 00:08:00.943\nWell, the person then that I have to\ntalk to might be Justin's deputy or\n\n137\n00:08:00.943 --> 00:08:03.194\nsomebody who's standing in for him.\n\n138\n00:08:03.194 --> 00:08:06.304\nAnd they may not be\nParticularly happy with me or\n\n139\n00:08:06.304 --> 00:08:10.990\nwith our organization because they\nperceive some sort of favoritism.\n\n140\n00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.690\nThey perceive the fact that we're\nalways talking to Justin and\n\n141\n00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.820\nwe never talk to anybody else.\n\n142\n00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.200\nOr they may be the sort of person\nwho wants to stick to the terms and\n\n143\n00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.560\nconditions of the contract.\n\n144\n00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.000\nAnd so\nbecause the relationship breaks down,\n\n145\n00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.199\nthen we have a tendency\nthen to micromanage.\n\n146\n00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.890\nAnd so then the service\nintegrator will step in and\n\n147\n00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:37.724\npotentially even the customer will\nstep in, trying to micromanage\n\n148\n00:08:37.724 --> 00:08:42.752\nall of these relationships,\nit's really really tricky situation.\n\n149\n00:08:42.752 --> 00:08:46.592\nBut all of this: the cultures,\nthe behaviors,\n\n150\n00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:51.462\nthe micromanagement, will start to,\nwell, it'll start to\n\n151\n00:08:51.462 --> 00:08:56.426\nbe evident in the value that we\nare presenting to our customer,\n\n152\n00:08:56.426 --> 00:09:00.088\ndon't you think?\n&gt;&gt; I definitely agree.\n\n153\n00:09:00.088 --> 00:09:06.530\nIn case I said I love it, I do not because\ninherently when someone micromanages me.\n\n154\n00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.028\nI probably do need some\nmanagement from time to time, but\n\n155\n00:09:09.028 --> 00:09:11.641\nnot micromanage where someone's\nalways got their thumb.\n\n156\n00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:15.981\nBecause inherently what it means, what it\ntells me or what I perceive it to tell me,\n\n157\n00:09:15.981 --> 00:09:18.772\nis you do not trust my capabilities,\nas an employee or\n\n158\n00:09:18.772 --> 00:09:21.010\nas some kind of technical individual.\n\n159\n00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:25.260\nYou do not trust me and\nmy decision making prowess, or\n\n160\n00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.340\nmy technical acumen if I'm\nin a technical capacity.\n\n161\n00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.600\nThat leads to this weird kind of back and\n\n162\n00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.780\nforth where you're like,\nno I'm not gonna tell you.\n\n163\n00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.503\nThat's a breakdown and, ultimately,\nwhat I think that leads to,\n\n164\n00:09:39.503 --> 00:09:40.756\nnotice I said I think.\n\n165\n00:09:40.756 --> 00:09:47.050\nSo this opinions aboard, is we have\na breakdown of how efficient we can be.\n\n166\n00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.950\nRight we end up with these weird\nlittle silos where there's not good\n\n167\n00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.750\ninterfaces between then, or there is\na single interface between all of them.\n\n168\n00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:59.179\nAnd then you pluck that out and then all\nof this breaks down, and then things just,\n\n169\n00:09:59.179 --> 00:10:03.877\nwell they end up a whole lot of not good.\n&gt;&gt; Well you mentioned the word trust and\n\n170\n00:10:03.877 --> 00:10:05.497\nof course trust isn't the,\n\n171\n00:10:05.497 --> 00:10:10.180\nright at the very beginning of this\nparticular slide that's in front of us.\n\n172\n00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.980\nAnd trust is really key to this.\n\n173\n00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.350\nYou can't just have it's\nthe service integrator's role.\n\n174\n00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.600\nYes it is to manage.\n\n175\n00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.450\nIt's to govern.\n\n176\n00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:22.583\nIt is to ensure that all\nof these service providers\n\n177\n00:10:22.583 --> 00:10:24.901\nat this level are working together.\n\n178\n00:10:24.901 --> 00:10:29.779\nYou cannot have the service\nintegrator actually well,\n\n179\n00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:33.730\nmanaging each individual interaction.\n\n180\n00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:34.790\nI've seen this happen and\n\n181\n00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.740\nI've seen service integrators that have\nto be present for absolutely everything.\n\n182\n00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.570\nAnd you get yourself into this vicious\ncircle where you have the service\n\n183\n00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:49.050\nintegrator who is aware that\nthere is a disjoint between us,\n\n184\n00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.460\nthat really we don't want\nto talk to each other.\n\n185\n00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.770\nSo the service integrator comes in and\nsays right okay,\n\n186\n00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.710\nI'm going to facilitate a discussion.\n\n187\n00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:59.250\nSo I'm going to facilitate\nmaybe weekly meetings.\n\n188\n00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:04.133\nWell, of course, then that adds into\nthe bureaucracy, it takes away from\n\n189\n00:11:04.133 --> 00:11:08.796\nthe flexibility, which also uses\nup the service integrator's time.\n\n190\n00:11:08.796 --> 00:11:11.080\nAnd that in itself is bad enough.\n\n191\n00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.750\nBut then, you see,\nwe're forced then to interact\n\n192\n00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:21.050\nin an environment that's not conducive\nto us being open and honest.\n\n193\n00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.560\nAnd in fact, is considered to be well,\n\n194\n00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:29.720\nway too formal to ensure that we can\nreally work together to achieve the goal.\n\n195\n00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.830\nBut then, the problem was micromanagement\nis a said you get into this vicious circle\n\n196\n00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.620\nbecause then the service\nintegrated comes in.\n\n197\n00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.970\nAnd says right,\nwell I'm gonna have to facilitate this.\n\n198\n00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:44.000\nBut then every time there there is\na meeting the service integrator wants to\n\n199\n00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.420\nbe involved.\n\n200\n00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.850\nAnd that means then that we perceive\nthe service integrates as being\n\n201\n00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.160\na micromanager.\n\n202\n00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:57.730\nBut then the service integrator\nperceives that they have to micromanage.\n\n203\n00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:05.040\nSo you get into a situation where we don't\nwant them there as service providers.\n\n204\n00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.520\nThey feel as though they have to be there.\n\n205\n00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.130\nWe resent them being there, and\n\n206\n00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.460\nthe more we resent them the more they\nfeel as though they have to be there.\n\n207\n00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:18.310\nAnd this sort of a downward spiral that\nyou're really going to get out of.\n\n208\n00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.950\nAll of this because we didn't address\norganizational change management when we\n\n209\n00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.220\nimplemented this SIAM ecosystem.\n\n210\n00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.353\nBecause we didn't look at the behaviors.\n\n211\n00:12:29.353 --> 00:12:31.900\nWe didn't look at that ABC.\n\n212\n00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:36.641\nWe didn't consider the culture and\nthe cultural fit..\n\n213\n00:12:36.641 --> 00:12:42.890\nAnd we now have, as a service integrator,\na tendency to micromanage.\n\n214\n00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:48.130\nAnd maybe that's because the customer\nis not happy with certain things.\n\n215\n00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.360\nMaybe, with incident management,\nI always use that as an example.\n\n216\n00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.784\nAnd so the customer is really well\ncomplaining to the service integrator that\n\n217\n00:12:56.784 --> 00:12:58.903\nservice is not quite what they seem.\n\n218\n00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:03.727\nAnd the service integrator sees\nthe only way of dealing with this as\n\n219\n00:13:03.727 --> 00:13:06.140\nbeing to micromanage.\n\n220\n00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:11.445\nAnd so that's exactly what it is that they\nfeel as though they are compelled to do.\n\n221\n00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:18.470\nIt doesn't particularly give us a good\nenvironment to work in, either.\n\n222\n00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.580\nIf you are the person that\nis being micromanaged.\n\n223\n00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.870\nIf you are the person that is\nsort of the other end of this,\n\n224\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.630\nit doesn't really give us a particularly\ngood environment to work in.\n\n225\n00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:29.900\n&gt;&gt; No it doesn't,\n\n226\n00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.460\nit tends to cut my\nproductivity personally.\n\n227\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.720\nBut I do wanna offer an alternative\nperspective because I think what happens\n\n228\n00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.370\nwith this vicious cycle is, the person\nmicromanaging may perceive this as.\n\n229\n00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.140\nWell I'm trying to help,\n\n230\n00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:46.700\nI'm trying to coach,\nI'm trying to make things better, right?\n\n231\n00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:51.170\nWhereas other people are perceiving\nit in another way, right?\n\n232\n00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:55.415\nSo, we have to be careful there\nbecause I know, I'm an instructor,\n\n233\n00:13:55.415 --> 00:14:00.337\nthere are times where, do I go and\ntry to facilitate, and like, progression?\n\n234\n00:14:00.337 --> 00:14:02.820\nOr do I let them do their own thing?\n\n235\n00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.800\nSo, there is a balance there, so\nI completely understand that.\n\n236\n00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.040\nWith that said,\nthese are complicated human issues\n\n237\n00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.580\nthat don't necessarily always\nhave the right answer.\n\n238\n00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.500\nThink being clear, transparent,\nand up front, right.\n\n239\n00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.550\nAnd having the ability,\nhaving that pre-established trust,\n\n240\n00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.090\nyou want to foster that.\n\n241\n00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:23.880\nBe able to say, hey Joe, when you come\nover here and hang out at my desk and\n\n242\n00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:29.090\nyou go you need to do that, you need to do\nthat, that causes me internal conflict.\n\n243\n00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.180\nIt creates this weird environment for me.\n\n244\n00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.460\nAs long as we have that\ntrust to talk about that,\n\n245\n00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.820\nthat's gonna help alleviate\nthat misunderstanding.\n\n246\n00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.300\nIf we don't,\nthen things can go horribly awry.\n\n247\n00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, we've also got to remember that\n\n248\n00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.240\nthe people that are performing\nthis are human.\n\n249\n00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:52.380\nAnd we've got to consider this human\naspect and we've got to have a degree of\n\n250\n00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:58.010\ntrust in our people, and a degree of trust\nin all of our service providers as well.\n\n251\n00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.800\nWhich again goes back to if we\nthink about our agile values, and\n\n252\n00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.630\nour agile values clearly state that\n\n253\n00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:12.090\nwe value collaboration over any\nsort of contractual documentation.\n\n254\n00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.170\nOver restrictive contracts so\n\n255\n00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:18.050\nwe cannot think about trying\nto contractualize everything.\n\n256\n00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.330\nWhat we've got to do is we've\ngot to encourage collaboration.\n\n257\n00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:22.100\nAnd of course,\n\n258\n00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.083\nif we take a look at organizational\nchange management and eight steps.\n\n259\n00:15:26.083 --> 00:15:30.317\nOne of the things that we really\nhave to do as part of that,\n\n260\n00:15:30.317 --> 00:15:34.760\nis not only to create a need,\ncreate a sense of urgency.\n\n261\n00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.910\nBut it's also to have a guiding coalition.\n\n262\n00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.792\nIt's to get people on board,\nit's to empower others.\n\n263\n00:15:42.792 --> 00:15:44.975\nAnd that's something that\nwe've really got to do is,\n\n264\n00:15:44.975 --> 00:15:48.650\nwe've got to bring people on board\nby giving them responsibilities.\n\n265\n00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:52.680\nSo let's take a look at some of\nthe mitigations then that we have with\n\n266\n00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.990\nthings like our cultural fit.\n\n267\n00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:58.883\nSo, things like, well,\njust simply assessing the culture.\n\n268\n00:15:58.883 --> 00:16:04.171\nThe cultural assessment is really\nimportant, and it’s not something that\n\n269\n00:16:04.171 --> 00:16:09.136\nI see done particularly often within IT,\nunless, There's an issue.\n\n270\n00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:13.660\nAnd it's only when there's an issue\nthat management would normally\n\n271\n00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.320\nconsider doing a cultural assessment.\n\n272\n00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.450\nAnd yet, it's something that I\nwould always recommend personally,\n\n273\n00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:24.870\nthat we do a cultural assessment before\nwe make any transformational change,\n\n274\n00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.770\nbefore we make any sort\nof structural change.\n\n275\n00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:32.970\nWhich is really what the,\nan implementation of a SIAM ecosystem is.\n\n276\n00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.740\nIt's a structural change,\nit's a change to the way we work.\n\n277\n00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:40.138\nAnd so, I would definitely recommend\na cultural assessment before we do that.\n\n278\n00:16:40.138 --> 00:16:43.257\nAnd that's a cultural\nassessment of our own people.\n\n279\n00:16:43.257 --> 00:16:45.410\nLet's see how resistant\nthey are to change.\n\n280\n00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:48.690\nBut also a cultural assessment in\nour service providers as well.\n\n281\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.070\nAnd then,\nwe talk about collaboration agreements.\n\n282\n00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:59.300\nAnd collaboration agreements really\ndefine the method of communication.\n\n283\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.390\nAnd that really involves, and\nit's going back to what you said, Justin,\n\n284\n00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:06.720\nabout you don't want to be\ninterrupted at your desk.\n\n285\n00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.540\nI'm assuming that it causes you issues.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n286\n00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:15.540\nfor, whenever we have interruptions at our\ndesk, if we are really what I would call\n\n287\n00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.310\nin the zone, in focus, in flow,\nwhatever you want to call it, right,\n\n288\n00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:25.090\nwe have, if all the pieces in our mind\nthat we need to juggle, we're there,\n\n289\n00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:30.240\nand I'm solving a problem that maybe\nJo told me that I needed to do, right?\n\n290\n00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.680\nWe're taking on\na particular role set here.\n\n291\n00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.200\nAnd then, when you come over and\nsay hey, have you done this yet?\n\n292\n00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.650\nOr I need you to do this,\nlet me do a quick check in.\n\n293\n00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:41.850\nAll that's disrupted.\n\n294\n00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:44.770\nI've lost the ability to juggle\nall of these things in my mind.\n\n295\n00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:51.500\nWhich kind of agitates me because it now\ndecreases my productivity, and I was\n\n296\n00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:56.220\non the verge of getting that done, bBut\nthen you asked me if I had done it yet,\n\n297\n00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.530\nand now it's not done, and it's gonna take\nme a little bit to get back into that.\n\n298\n00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:01.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\n\n299\n00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:05.200\nalso it's not just gonna take you a bit\nof time to get back into that, but\n\n300\n00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.610\nI probably, being on the receiving\nend of then a little bit of, well,\n\n301\n00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:15.440\nI was going to say attitude, but certainly\nI would have detected when I interrupted\n\n302\n00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.120\nyou that I was interrupting you.\n\n303\n00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.660\nAnd I would have detected that you were\nprobably a little bit aggravated by\n\n304\n00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.590\nthe fact that I was interrupting you,\nWhich is why,\n\n305\n00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:28.300\nand Agile gives us some ways of\ndealing with this by the way.\n\n306\n00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:32.920\nAgile project management will\ngive us ways of managing people.\n\n307\n00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.570\nAnd if will simply say look,\n\n308\n00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:39.470\nlet's work out when my productive\ntime is during the day.\n\n309\n00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:43.380\nAnd then let's say okay, my productive\ntime during the day is between the hours\n\n310\n00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.340\nof, say, 9:00 am and 11:00 am.\n\n311\n00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.320\nThat's my productive time.\n\n312\n00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.690\nSo during that productive time,\nthat's when I'm at my most alert and\n\n313\n00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:52.730\nmy most awake.\n\n314\n00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.660\nI don't want to be interrupted,\nand I don't want to be disturbed.\n\n315\n00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:01.540\nAnd we would list that in what we\ncall collaboration agreements.\n\n316\n00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:06.570\nSo during this particular time,\ncould you please ensure that if you want\n\n317\n00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:11.470\nto approach me, that you approach\nme maybe via e-mail, for instance.\n\n318\n00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:16.990\nOr that you send me a message on\nour instant messaging system so\n\n319\n00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:23.120\nthat I am not actually interrupted\nright here and now at my desk.\n\n320\n00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.400\nBecause that's gonna make me\nlose my train of thought.\n\n321\n00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.360\nSo when we talk about collaboration\nagreement, what we actually mean\n\n322\n00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.890\nis that we're just gonna document\nwhat works best for everybody else.\n\n323\n00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:41.920\nThis is not necessarily a formal\nprocess for communication.\n\n324\n00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.440\nBecause to do that, again,\n\n325\n00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.770\nwe get back into that contractualization\nthat we don't want to do.\n\n326\n00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:49.610\nThe other thing that's really important,\nand\n\n327\n00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:54.170\nthat's something that\nI can't stress enough.\n\n328\n00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:58.080\nAnd that second bullet point talks\nabout demonstrating correct behavior\n\n329\n00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.059\nat the customer and\nthe service integrator level.\n\n330\n00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:03.990\nThat's so important.\n\n331\n00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:10.220\nAnd we were having a discussion\nearlier on, prior to\n\n332\n00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:15.090\nrecording actually, about interesting\nthings that your mom used to say to you.\n\n333\n00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.312\nAnd interesting things that\nmy mom used to say to me,\n\n334\n00:20:18.312 --> 00:20:20.810\nwhich were don't do as I do, do as I say.\n\n335\n00:20:23.459 --> 00:20:26.990\nLeadership by example is really important.\n\n336\n00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:31.300\nSo don't go around telling everybody else\nthat they can't interrupt Justin, but\n\n337\n00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.620\nthen you think that it's\nokay to interrupt Justin.\n\n338\n00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:39.062\nEverybody's gotta demonstrate that\nsame behavior, absolutely everybody.\n\n339\n00:20:39.062 --> 00:20:44.760\nSo that it's not just a case of one rule\nfor one and another rule for others.\n\n340\n00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.900\nIf Justin has said this is how I would\nlike you to communicate with me,\n\n341\n00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:55.240\nwe should respect that this is how\nwe should communicate with him.\n\n342\n00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.950\nBecause that's what's most efficient,\nmost effective for him.\n\n343\n00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:05.050\nAnd we have to, as we've said, continually\nreinforce that behavior at all levels.\n\n344\n00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.490\nIt's not just one rule for\none and one rule for another.\n\n345\n00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.560\nAnd we should have really what\nwe consider to be audits,\n\n346\n00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.470\nnot necessarily formal audits, but\n\n347\n00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:18.540\nwe should have regular audits just to\ncheck that everything is working okay.\n\n348\n00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.530\nSo I should be on a regular\nbasis approaching Justin and\n\n349\n00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.220\nsay hey is everything okay?\n\n350\n00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.236\nDo you get interrupted?\n\n351\n00:21:26.236 --> 00:21:28.578\nDo your collaboration agreements,\ndo they work?\n\n352\n00:21:28.578 --> 00:21:31.840\nAre people approaching you as\nyou've asked to be promoted?\n\n353\n00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:38.420\nWe also have to bear in mind that,\ndid I say promoted?\n\n354\n00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.040\nI meant approached.\n\n355\n00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.730\nBut if you wanna be promoted, Justin,\nyou know what, if you do your job,\n\n356\n00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.700\nthen I guess we'll promote you.\n&gt;&gt; I have a few questions about that\n\n357\n00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.714\nbefore I accept a promotion.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n358\n00:21:47.714 --> 00:21:49.137\n&gt;&gt; What kind of responsibility\n\n359\n00:21:49.137 --> 00:21:50.382\nincreases am I gonna have?\n\n360\n00:21:50.382 --> 00:21:52.577\nAnd then is there-\n&gt;&gt; There's no pay raise, right?\n\n361\n00:21:52.577 --> 00:21:53.110\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm out.\n\n362\n00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.999\n&gt;&gt; No, no salary, right?\n\n363\n00:21:53.999 --> 00:21:55.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm out, but we jest.\n\n364\n00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.490\nAnd I wanna-\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n365\n00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.670\nI mean it's mentioned on that slide,\nright?\n\n366\n00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.460\nLook it says rewarding good behavior.\n\n367\n00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.150\nSo we do wanna do that, but\nyou're not getting anything.\n\n368\n00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Probably not.\n\n369\n00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:09.900\nBut the only way that you can reward good\nbehavior is if you have kind of a thumb on\n\n370\n00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.070\nyour pulse of those behaviors\nprior to these changes.\n\n371\n00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.330\nWe talked about taking that\ncultural assessment, and\n\n372\n00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:20.600\nsomething that struck me is that you\nshould really be proactive about that.\n\n373\n00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.090\nI need to know before\nsomething goes wrong.\n\n374\n00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:26.600\nWhen things go wrong, when it comes\nto culture, culture fit, individuals,\n\n375\n00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:31.140\ninteractions between individuals,\nif you only do an assessment when\n\n376\n00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:35.140\nthings go wrong, then the damage is\ndone to some extent with people.\n\n377\n00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:35.860\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and\n\n378\n00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.830\nthis is something that I\nreally can't stress enough.\n\n379\n00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:41.840\nAnd I said this right at the very start,\nyou're so right.\n\n380\n00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.330\nThat this cultural assessment\nneeds to be done before.\n\n381\n00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.320\nNot something that needs\nto be done afterwards,\n\n382\n00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.890\nonce the damage has already been done.\n\n383\n00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:53.830\nIt needs to be done before\nwe start making changes.\n\n384\n00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:57.530\nBecause, like you say,\nyou're dealing with people.\n\n385\n00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:59.660\nAnd once people have\nmade a first impression,\n\n386\n00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:05.080\nwhether it's of another person or whether\nit's of a particular change, once they\n\n387\n00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.808\nhave that first impression formed, it’s\nreally, really difficult to change that.\n\n388\n00:23:09.808 --> 00:23:14.460\nOnce they have already established\na pattern of resistance,\n\n389\n00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.170\nit’s incredibly difficult to change that.\n\n390\n00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:24.380\nSo we have to overcome any resistance\nbefore we actually start the change.\n\n391\n00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.590\nAnd so, we have to create a sense\nof urgency, as we'd say, or\n\n392\n00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:33.130\ncreate a need before we even start our\nimplementation of our Siam ecosystem.\n\n393\n00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:39.180\nOr before we implement any collaboration,\nwe have to assess the culture,\n\n394\n00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:45.290\nand we have to identify the needs,\nidentify the needs of\n\n395\n00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:51.190\neach individual stakeholder so that we\ncan meet those needs, so that we can\n\n396\n00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:56.510\naddress any concerns that they have before\nthey've even voiced those concerns.\n\n397\n00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:57.724\nSo it's incredibly important.\n\n398\n00:23:57.724 --> 00:24:02.626\nThe cultural assessment should be done\nbefore we do any implementation and\n\n399\n00:24:02.626 --> 00:24:06.687\nnot afterwards, not after\nthe damage has already been done.\n\n400\n00:24:06.687 --> 00:24:10.176\nBecause then you're really\nfighting an uphill battle.\n\n401\n00:24:10.176 --> 00:24:14.909\nAnd it's exactly the same when we talk\nabout the micromanagement, and as I said,\n\n402\n00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:19.050\nI group these three topics together\ncuz they're incredibly similar.\n\n403\n00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:22.480\nThey're all really, I was gonna say,\ndifferent sides of the same coin, but\n\n404\n00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.230\nmost coins are already two sided.\n\n405\n00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:28.390\nBut you get what I mean.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know of any three.\n\n406\n00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.080\nIt's different sides of the same triangle.\n\n407\n00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.220\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right then, yeah,\n\n408\n00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.860\nI'm okay with that.\n&gt;&gt; We'll go with it.\n\n409\n00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:40.360\nMaybe it's a hyper dimensional\ncoin where there's like a third.\n\n410\n00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.020\nI got nerdy on you anyway.\n&gt;&gt; Anyway yeah we got that.\n\n411\n00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:44.660\n&gt;&gt; But anyway,\n\n412\n00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.640\nwe all get what you're saying.\n\n413\n00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.750\nIt's the many facets of\na similar abstract idea.\n\n414\n00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:51.540\n&gt;&gt; Well, it is.\n\n415\n00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.410\nI mean, take a look at the mitigation for\nmicromanagement.\n\n416\n00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:59.770\nIt's very, very similar to\nthe mitigation for culture and for\n\n417\n00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:01.510\nbehaviors, incredibly similar.\n\n418\n00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:03.540\nIt's about having the structure,\n\n419\n00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:08.070\nhaving collaboration,\nhaving regular communication.\n\n420\n00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:12.520\nNot too much communication, but\nin the right language, getting it right.\n\n421\n00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.130\nAnd having that trust,\nthat's what we really need to do.\n\n422\n00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:21.210\nSo what we have really emphasized\nis the fact that culture,\n\n423\n00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:25.030\nattitudes, behaviors, that's gonna make or\n\n424\n00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:32.400\nbreak a successful SIAM ecosystem,\nand we shouldn't underestimate it.\n\n425\n00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:37.040\nAnd I know that you're going to be\nlooking at your foundation test\n\n426\n00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.740\nin a couple of episodes' time.\n\n427\n00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:45.010\nAnd what I really want you to do is\nmake sure that you do spend some time,\n\n428\n00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:48.230\nyou do concentrate on\nthe cultural aspects of this.\n\n429\n00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:52.080\nBecause this is critical, this is key.\n\n430\n00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.710\nIt's key to the SIAM ecosystem working.\n\n431\n00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:59.448\nWithout addressing cultural issues,\nthen it quite simply is not going to work.\n\n432\n00:25:59.448 --> 00:26:00.839\n&gt;&gt; Now, Jo,\n\n433\n00:26:00.839 --> 00:26:06.010\nspeaking of using appropriate language,\nyou're using some language here\n\n434\n00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:10.410\nthat makes it seem like maybe we've\ndiscussed culture and micro-management and\n\n435\n00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:15.980\nsome of these trust issues that could\nbe barriers to forward progress.\n\n436\n00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:21.050\nBut have we discussed all challenges and\nrisk associated with this migration or\n\n437\n00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:22.730\nevolution?\n&gt;&gt; No, we haven't.\n\n438\n00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:25.060\nWe have one more episode left.\n\n439\n00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:29.000\nAnd in that episode, again,\nwe're looking at challenges, risks.\n\n440\n00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.750\nWe're gonna carry on looking\nat promotional challenges,\n\n441\n00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:36.555\nwe're gonna look at security, and\nwe're going to look at measurements and\n\n442\n00:26:36.555 --> 00:26:42.080\nensuring that we can demonstrate\nsuccess of the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n443\n00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.827\nSo I'm gonna ask everybody to join\nus back for the next episode.\n\n444\n00:26:45.827 --> 00:26:47.610\nI don't know whether that\nwas what you were gonna do.\n\n445\n00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:49.360\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm definitely gonna\n\n446\n00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.450\nrecommend you come on back for\na part three.\n\n447\n00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:53.930\nBecause we're continuing our\nlook at challenges and risks.\n\n448\n00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.650\nWe had a chainsaw and we had a barricade.\n\n449\n00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:57.160\nI'm not even sure if that's real.\n\n450\n00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.870\nBut now we have a motorcycle on fire,\nkind of juggling them around in the air.\n\n451\n00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.720\nAnd I'm just using these\nas visual metaphors.\n\n452\n00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.070\nThat is not necessarily an application.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know where\n\n453\n00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:09.008\nhe is going.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We have more complexity to\n\n454\n00:27:09.008 --> 00:27:12.470\nconsider when looking at\nthe respective ecosystems.\n\n455\n00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.210\nSo definitely join us back, but for now,\nwe’re gonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n456\n00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.180\nSo signing off for ITProTV.\n\n457\n00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.990\nI’ve been your host Justin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt; And I’m Jo Peacock.\n\n458\n00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.714\n&gt;&gt; And we’ll see you next time.\n\n459\n00:27:20.714 --> 00:27:26.844\n[MUSIC]\n\n460\n00:27:26.844 --> 00:27:29.145\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Franscisco,\n\n3\n00:00:04.732 --> 00:00:06.412\nCalifornia.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.412 --> 00:00:08.339\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:13.149\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.131\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:19.377\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\nwe're back for the hat trick so\n\n8\n00:00:19.377 --> 00:00:23.408\nto speak of challenges and risk, and this\nis part of our SIAM Foundation series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.408 --> 00:00:26.280\nAnd well,\nwe have a little more to talk about.\n\n10\n00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.406\nLuckily we have someone who's gonna\ntake us by the hand and guide our way.\n\n11\n00:00:29.406 --> 00:00:32.475\nThe one and only Miss Jo Peacock,\nhow are you doing today Jo?\n\n12\n00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:34.202\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you Justin,\n\n13\n00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:36.719\nhow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, and well we've\n\n14\n00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.840\ntalked about some of the other challenges\nand risks that we kind of encountered.\n\n15\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.020\nAnd one that really sticks with me\nis culture and micro-management.\n\n16\n00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.942\nBut I know we have a few more to talk\nabout, what are we actually gonna address\n\n17\n00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:50.465\nin this episode?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is our final episode\n\n18\n00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:55.447\nwhere we look at risks and\nchallenges to the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n19\n00:00:55.447 --> 00:00:58.622\nAnd in our next episode, believe or not,\n\n20\n00:00:58.622 --> 00:01:04.450\nwe're actually going to be looking at\nthe test, the SIAM foundation test.\n\n21\n00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.630\nYou better get prepared for that,\nyou know you've got a test coming right?\n\n22\n00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.070\n&gt;&gt; You keep telling me that but,\n\n23\n00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.215\nI guess we'll have to see if\nthat actually comes to fruition.\n\n24\n00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:16.880\nBut something that's gonna be\nimportant for preparing for\n\n25\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.910\nthat test is knowing about\nall of the challenges and\n\n26\n00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.187\nrisks that we may encounter.\n&gt;&gt; It's very true, yeah, so\n\n27\n00:01:23.187 --> 00:01:24.898\nin this particular episode then,\n\n28\n00:01:24.898 --> 00:01:28.507\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\nlook at our commercial challenges.\n\n29\n00:01:28.507 --> 00:01:33.711\nWe're also going to look\nat our security challenges.\n\n30\n00:01:33.711 --> 00:01:37.123\nAnd then we're going to look\nat how we actually define and\n\n31\n00:01:37.123 --> 00:01:40.550\nhow we measure the success of\nour SIAM ecosystem itself.\n\n32\n00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.360\nSo let's take a look then at some\ncommercial challenges that we have\n\n33\n00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.230\nas an organization.\n\n34\n00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.550\nWhen we're implementing a SIAM ecosystem,\nit's important that\n\n35\n00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.440\nwe have realistic targets for\nwhat it is that we want to achieve.\n\n36\n00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.837\nSo, let's think about this,\n\n37\n00:02:00.837 --> 00:02:05.647\nI mean if we don't then we might\nnever achieve those targets.\n\n38\n00:02:05.647 --> 00:02:10.042\nSo, our targets have to be realistic,\nthey have to be,\n\n39\n00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:14.261\nwell not too reaching but\nalso have to be achievable.\n\n40\n00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:19.344\nSo we wanna think about smart when it\ncomes to implementing a SIAM ecosystem and\n\n41\n00:02:19.344 --> 00:02:24.051\nmake sure that what it is we want to\nachieve is laid out in black and white.\n\n42\n00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:28.839\nAnd we wanna look at that in a little\nwhile when we look at measuring success.\n\n43\n00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.810\nWe also have to understand how\nwe define the boundaries between\n\n44\n00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.480\nall of our service providers.\n\n45\n00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.520\nBearing in mind and this where you\nknow one of our big challenges lie.\n\n46\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.720\nIs the fact that we may have multiple\nservice providers, we will have multiple\n\n47\n00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.000\nservice providers, some of them maybe\nexternal and some of them maybe internal.\n\n48\n00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.574\nAnd so we have to consider that as\na service integrator we will have\n\n49\n00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:58.740\ncontracts in place with\nexternal service providers.\n\n50\n00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.452\nAnd we will have OLAs,\noperational level agreements,\n\n51\n00:03:01.452 --> 00:03:04.040\nin place with internal service providers.\n\n52\n00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.630\nAnd if we are an external\nservice integrator,\n\n53\n00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.650\nthen we will have contracts in place.\n\n54\n00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.100\nAnd then we've also got the challenge of\nthe ethics themselves between all of our\n\n55\n00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.070\nservice providers.\n\n56\n00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.932\nIf they're external, then there's\ncertainly going to be different ethics and\n\n57\n00:03:20.932 --> 00:03:24.437\ndifferent ways of working to\nthe customer organization so\n\n58\n00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:26.593\nwe're gonna have to address that.\n\n59\n00:03:26.593 --> 00:03:31.326\nWe're going to have to consider\nthat in our contract negotiation.\n\n60\n00:03:31.326 --> 00:03:38.046\nBecause if we don't, then we're gonna come\nacross some issues a little bit later on\n\n61\n00:03:38.046 --> 00:03:43.933\nas we evolve into that ecosystem and\nas we start to manage that ecosystem.\n\n62\n00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:48.854\nYou see if the service integrator\nis managing the services, but\n\n63\n00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:52.228\ndoesn't have control over the contract and\n\n64\n00:03:52.228 --> 00:03:57.090\ndoesn't have control over those ethics and\nthose standards.\n\n65\n00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.160\nAnd doesn't have an understanding\nof those standards, either.\n\n66\n00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.400\nThen again, the ecosystem is not actually\ngoing to be particularly successful.\n\n67\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.940\nBecause with the service integrator has\ngot to manage service providers with\n\n68\n00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.230\nmultiple ways of working and\nperhaps with multiple cultures as well.\n\n69\n00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:25.450\nThat is a challenge definitely\ncommercially, think about scale as well.\n\n70\n00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.570\nJustin, I'm assuming you've\ngot Internet at home.\n\n71\n00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.230\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n72\n00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.460\n&gt;&gt; Just an assumption.\n\n73\n00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.675\n&gt;&gt; Being a technical individual,\n\n74\n00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:38.680\nit's a pretty good assumption.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and so\n\n75\n00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.100\nwhen you approached your\nInternet service provider, and\n\n76\n00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.035\nyou said to your internet\nservice provider, didn't you?\n\n77\n00:04:47.035 --> 00:04:51.189\nRight, these are the terms and\nconditions of my particular contract.\n\n78\n00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:54.524\nThese are my standard terms and\nconditions, and I want you to sign these\n\n79\n00:04:54.524 --> 00:04:57.395\nterms and conditions, didn't you?\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what Jo,\n\n80\n00:04:57.395 --> 00:05:01.930\nit's like you're getting into my dreams\nthat are complete and utter fantasy,\n\n81\n00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.787\nbecause where I live,\nwe have yet but one choice.\n\n82\n00:05:04.787 --> 00:05:07.179\nAnd I was told what terms and\n\n83\n00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:11.733\nconditions I was gonna abide by.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and you know what,\n\n84\n00:05:11.733 --> 00:05:14.369\nthis is actually quite\na normal scenario and\n\n85\n00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:17.990\nit's not just about your\nInternet service provider.\n\n86\n00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.540\nBut in the business world,\nthis can be quite a regular scenario,\n\n87\n00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:29.008\nand unfortunately I have to say this, but\nthis really does depend on the scale and\n\n88\n00:05:29.008 --> 00:05:35.390\nmaybe the geographic location or\nthe culture of your organization itself.\n\n89\n00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.015\nYou may have some influence on\nyour service providers, but\n\n90\n00:05:40.015 --> 00:05:45.206\nyour service providers may actually\nhave the influence over you.\n\n91\n00:05:45.206 --> 00:05:47.793\nJustin has no influence\nover his service provider,\n\n92\n00:05:47.793 --> 00:05:49.802\nhe has to sign their standard contract.\n\n93\n00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:55.110\nNow, when you think about this think\nabout this in terms of managing a home.\n\n94\n00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.995\nIf your service provider for your Internet\nis different to the service provider that\n\n95\n00:05:58.995 --> 00:06:02.770\nyou have for your TV, and it's different\nto the service provider that you may have\n\n96\n00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.485\nfor a home telephone if you have one.\n\n97\n00:06:04.485 --> 00:06:08.347\nAnd it's different to the service provider\nthat you have for your electricity,\n\n98\n00:06:08.347 --> 00:06:09.610\nlet's think about this.\n\n99\n00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.310\nBecause if the electricity goes down,\nthen you have no Internet service.\n\n100\n00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:23.980\nSo those two service providers should\nthen, in a SIAM ecosystem, work together.\n\n101\n00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.510\nSo, that if the electricity goes down for\nwhatever reason, if we have a power cut,\n\n102\n00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.978\nJustin's shaking his head because this is\nwhat he would consider to be his ideal,\n\n103\n00:06:32.978 --> 00:06:35.572\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I just realized that\n\n104\n00:06:35.572 --> 00:06:40.802\ntechnically I'm a service integrator\nto some extent and it's kind of odd.\n\n105\n00:06:40.802 --> 00:06:44.976\nBecause it would be nice, if they would\nwork together, yet they do not typically.\n\n106\n00:06:44.976 --> 00:06:46.169\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, but\n\n107\n00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:49.259\nthis is the dilemma that\nmost organizations face and\n\n108\n00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:52.490\nthis is why we talk about\ncommercial challenges.\n\n109\n00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.520\nBecause my service provider for\n\n110\n00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.690\nmy electricity never ever tells me\nwhen my service is going to go down.\n\n111\n00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.750\nIt generally just suddenly happens,\nI get a power cut.\n\n112\n00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.510\nAnd then all of a sudden now I have\nno Internet, and I have no TV either.\n\n113\n00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.189\nSo they don't talk to each\nother as service providers.\n\n114\n00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.475\nThat kind of, when you realize that\nactually this is the environment that\n\n115\n00:07:17.475 --> 00:07:20.390\nwe're talking about,\nit doesn't sound quite so\n\n116\n00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.880\nweird, the fact that what we wanna to do\nis to get them talking to each other.\n\n117\n00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.540\nBut this is what the service\nintegrator is trying to do,\n\n118\n00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.340\nis to get them talking to each other.\n\n119\n00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.933\nIs to get them to understand\nthe relationships,\n\n120\n00:07:31.933 --> 00:07:34.916\nand to get our service providers\ntalking to each other.\n\n121\n00:07:34.916 --> 00:07:40.636\nBut then let's go back to that last bullet\npoint, in the fact that how often do you,\n\n122\n00:07:40.636 --> 00:07:46.116\n[LAUGH] and I'm talking to Justin here,\nhave influence over these service level\n\n123\n00:07:46.116 --> 00:07:50.559\ntargets contained in these contracts?\n&gt;&gt; Jo, all you're doing is making\n\n124\n00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:53.485\nme feel powerless and insignificant.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n125\n00:07:53.485 --> 00:07:54.510\n&gt;&gt; That's okay, I'll tell you that.\n\n126\n00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.494\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n127\n00:07:56.494 --> 00:08:00.850\n&gt;&gt; We don't have any influence at all.\n\n128\n00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.289\nAnd this is where most service\nintegrators find themselves.\n\n129\n00:08:04.289 --> 00:08:08.340\nAnd so obviously,\nhow do we manage as a service integrator?\n\n130\n00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.953\nWe have a customer and\nhow do we manage then,\n\n131\n00:08:11.953 --> 00:08:16.346\nprovision of a service as\na whole when we cannot ensure\n\n132\n00:08:16.346 --> 00:08:21.440\ncollaboration between all of\nthe components of the service?\n\n133\n00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.132\nIf you want to be able to send and receive\nemails, you have to from your phone, you\n\n134\n00:08:26.132 --> 00:08:30.970\nhave to have some electricity and you also\nhave to have Internet service provider.\n\n135\n00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:36.380\nWhat if you don't have any electricity\nthen therefore you don't have the Internet\n\n136\n00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.710\nservice provider and therefore\nyou can't send and receive email.\n\n137\n00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.750\nThese are the commercial challenges\nthat any service integrator has.\n\n138\n00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.000\nSo how do they overcome that?\n\n139\n00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.570\nWell contract negotiation is key and\n\n140\n00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:55.120\nunderstanding the boundaries\nin the service interactions.\n\n141\n00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.100\nNow I'm gonna bring something\nelse into this as well.\n\n142\n00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:04.040\nI mean, I remember a time many many years\nago when I had a problem with my Internet.\n\n143\n00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.270\nAnd I would call up my service\nprovider and they would tell me, no,\n\n144\n00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.850\nit's the equipment that I was using.\n\n145\n00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.510\nBut then I knew that the equipment\nwas working fine, but\n\n146\n00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:17.840\nthe service provider would tell me,\nno, it's definitely the equipment.\n\n147\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.055\nThe service provider,\nit's not my problem, it's there's.\n\n148\n00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.660\nIt's that collaboration that we've been\ntalking about in all of our previous\n\n149\n00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.760\nepisodes.\n\n150\n00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.220\nAnd that's something that we have to\nget right in the contract and remember\n\n151\n00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:35.020\nwhat we've said in previous episodes\ntoo about the fact that collaboration\n\n152\n00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:40.140\nis probably more valuable than\nthe contracts themselves.\n\n153\n00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.042\nWe need to have a degree of\nflexibility in those contracts.\n\n154\n00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:47.860\nHm, when was the last time you went\nto your service provider Justin, and\n\n155\n00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.590\nasked him for some flexibility?\n&gt;&gt; I wanna be honest with you Jo,\n\n156\n00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:55.810\nthe thing is, I've actually thought\nabout forming a business in my home\n\n157\n00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:59.580\nin order to engage as a business\nto business contract.\n\n158\n00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:04.445\nBecause of these exact issues,\nI've had so many times you're like,\n\n159\n00:10:04.445 --> 00:10:09.419\nrouters down or it must be the cable\ncoming into house, or no, no, no.\n\n160\n00:10:09.419 --> 00:10:14.570\nI've checked all of those and let's just\ngo ahead and skip ahead in this trip.\n\n161\n00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.560\nAnd I try to be very\nunderstanding of that, but\n\n162\n00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.740\nI have thought about\nengaging as a business.\n\n163\n00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.965\nI am Justin Dennison Inc.\n\n164\n00:10:21.965 --> 00:10:23.830\n[LAUGH] What does that mean?\n\n165\n00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.425\nThat means that I'm gonna\nneed some guarantees.\n\n166\n00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:27.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And-\n\n167\n00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.380\n&gt;&gt; Wait a minute, I said a bad word,\n\n168\n00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:34.810\nsome assurances maybe, I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter\n\n169\n00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.940\nit still won't work like that, trust me.\n&gt;&gt; No no.\n\n170\n00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.420\nTrust me.\n&gt;&gt; That's why I haven't\n\n171\n00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.320\ndone it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n172\n00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.941\nYou kinda wasted you time but\nit was fun to watch,\n\n173\n00:10:43.941 --> 00:10:45.191\nright?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] For somebody.\n\n174\n00:10:45.191 --> 00:10:46.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] From a service\n\n175\n00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:51.050\nintegrator perspective, though this is\nexactly the challenge that we've got.\n\n176\n00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.167\nAnd we'll tell you to have\nclear unambiguous contracts,\n\n177\n00:10:54.167 --> 00:10:56.550\nwe'll tell you to\nnegotiate those contracts.\n\n178\n00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:01.060\nAnd sometimes we also recognize\nthat it's not quite that easy and\n\n179\n00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:01.890\nthat's your challenge.\n\n180\n00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.010\nYou have to ensure that you\ncan mitigate those risks,\n\n181\n00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:10.410\nbecause if you don't do that, then you\ncould lose service to the customer.\n\n182\n00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:16.150\nSo have regular reviews and\ncheck your contracts regularly.\n\n183\n00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.980\nEven if you feel as though you have\nno influence on your contract,\n\n184\n00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.720\nI wonder how often Justin you go back and\nyou check your contract and\n\n185\n00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.290\nyou check the standard terms and\nconditions of your service\n\n186\n00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:29.360\nprovider to see if it's changed at all?\n&gt;&gt; So Jo,\n\n187\n00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.650\nI'm gonna be completely transparent about\nthis, I don't bother because I don't have\n\n188\n00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:33.960\nany choice.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n189\n00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.360\n&gt;&gt; And because I don't have choice,\n\n190\n00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.970\nI don't really have any, there is\nno circumstance where I can enforce\n\n191\n00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.000\nany type of power in this situation.\n&gt;&gt; Well, you aren't alone.\n\n192\n00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.705\nYou are not alone, I mean most people,\nmost customer of those types of service\n\n193\n00:11:48.705 --> 00:11:53.497\nproviders don't actually go back and\nreview the contracts on a regular basis.\n\n194\n00:11:53.497 --> 00:11:58.477\nBut yet will tell you that certainly\nas a an organization that something\n\n195\n00:11:58.477 --> 00:12:03.374\nthat we really suspect that you should do,\nsomething we definitely,\n\n196\n00:12:03.374 --> 00:12:06.110\ndefinitely recommend.\n\n197\n00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:11.240\nSo let's take a look then at one of the\nother challenges that we have here to both\n\n198\n00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:18.810\nimplement and\nevolve in our SIAM ecosystem and security.\n\n199\n00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.020\nSecurity is a huge challenge.\n\n200\n00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.860\nWe've already talked about data.\n\n201\n00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.950\nAnd we talked about information\non who owns the data.\n\n202\n00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:32.202\nBut we have to also have some\ncontrols not just over our data but\n\n203\n00:12:32.202 --> 00:12:36.750\nalso of a security and\nwho has access to our services.\n\n204\n00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.392\nMapping out data flows and mapping out\nwho should have access to our services.\n\n205\n00:12:42.392 --> 00:12:46.790\nThere's some fantastic TV commercials\naround where, and this has been going on\n\n206\n00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:52.390\nfor quite a number of years now as well,\nwhere engineers will turn up to sites\n\n207\n00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:56.730\nto fix something that's not quite broken\nor to fix something that's actually,\n\n208\n00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:01.220\nwe used to call them ET back in the day\nbecause they used to call home.\n\n209\n00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:06.047\nAnd that's quite prevalent\nespecially in IT.\n\n210\n00:13:06.047 --> 00:13:11.480\nWe have self healing services now\nthat actually fix themselves and\n\n211\n00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.731\nthen call home and let somebody\nknow that something has broken.\n\n212\n00:13:16.731 --> 00:13:18.685\nWe have to consider the security of that.\n\n213\n00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.350\nSo security roles and\n\n214\n00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:27.950\nsecurity responsibilities across your\nservice providers have to be mapped out.\n\n215\n00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:31.160\nThey have to be allocated and\nthey have to be clear.\n\n216\n00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.270\nOtherwise, you will\nhave security breaches.\n\n217\n00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.970\nSo you need to have a strategy for\nsecurity.\n\n218\n00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:44.290\nAnd you might wanna use other other\npractices like COBIT for instance or\n\n219\n00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:50.160\nmaybe even some ISO 27002 practices to\nhelp you with your data security and\n\n220\n00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.340\nwith your IT security.\n\n221\n00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.610\nWe want to have, I mentioned\na culture of openness there, and\n\n222\n00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.000\nwe want to have a culture of openness.\n\n223\n00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.620\nBut nevertheless, we still have to be\nvery, very careful of data security.\n\n224\n00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.220\nOne of the things that I do want to point\nout is if we don't have a culture of\n\n225\n00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:12.130\nopenness, what tends to happen is\npeople will find a way around it.\n\n226\n00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:16.330\nAnd Justin's grinning now,\nbut it's really common.\n\n227\n00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:21.132\nIf you tell me that I can't have\naccess to something, boy will I go\n\n228\n00:14:21.132 --> 00:14:25.700\nout of my way to find access to something.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah to\n\n229\n00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:30.750\nsome extent it's a little bit of human\nnature, you can't do that, yeah wanna bet?\n\n230\n00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:31.730\nWatch me.\n\n231\n00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.290\nBut it is funny because\nwhen I read that bullet\n\n232\n00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.330\npoint that is not what\nI was thinking about.\n\n233\n00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.810\nI was thinking about you see something\nyou say something kind of thing\n\n234\n00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.760\nbecause you know, if you see someone\ndoing it is not to be a snitch.\n\n235\n00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:47.199\nBut if you observe, if I was to find\nout some kind of security flaw that I\n\n236\n00:14:47.199 --> 00:14:50.436\ncould exploit,\nI would probably tell somebody and\n\n237\n00:14:50.436 --> 00:14:54.745\nnot probably when I say probably\nI'm saying like 99.999%.\n\n238\n00:14:54.745 --> 00:14:57.724\nI'm not gonna say it, absolutes.\n\n239\n00:14:57.724 --> 00:15:01.834\nBut I would tell somebody because it's\ngonna make everything a little better for\n\n240\n00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:05.435\nall us, right probably be doing\nthat without permission anyway but-\n\n241\n00:15:05.435 --> 00:15:07.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, you know,\n\n242\n00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:11.190\nthere are a couple of things when we talk\nabout openness when it comes to security.\n\n243\n00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:15.010\nAnd one is that you have to\nhave a degree of openness.\n\n244\n00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.480\nSo let me give you\nan example that happened\n\n245\n00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.418\nquite a few years ago when I was\nworking in government in the UK.\n\n246\n00:15:22.418 --> 00:15:26.270\nAnd we wouldn't allow anybody to\n\n247\n00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:30.580\nplug anything into a USB port\nat all because of security.\n\n248\n00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:34.344\nAnd so\nwhat would happen is that customers or\n\n249\n00:15:34.344 --> 00:15:39.137\nusers would try and\nfind their own ways of doing things.\n\n250\n00:15:39.137 --> 00:15:41.659\nOkay, so I can't use the USB port,\nokay, but\n\n251\n00:15:41.659 --> 00:15:45.970\nthere are all other ports on this\nparticular device that I have.\n\n252\n00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.070\nAnd I can potentially use this.\n\n253\n00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:52.921\nAnd I can still download\nthings from the Internet.\n\n254\n00:15:52.921 --> 00:15:59.346\nWhat we have to accept in IT,\nthat it was actually more sensible For\n\n255\n00:15:59.346 --> 00:16:04.282\nus to allow limited access\nto certain things rather\n\n256\n00:16:04.282 --> 00:16:09.000\nthan to refuse access to certain things.\n\n257\n00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.720\nBecause if we refused\naccess to certain things,\n\n258\n00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.565\nthen people would go out of\ntheir way to try and get access.\n\n259\n00:16:14.565 --> 00:16:20.100\nWhereas if we allowed access but,\nallowed it in a limited and\n\n260\n00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:25.010\ncontrolled way,\nthen actually what happened was that\n\n261\n00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:30.340\nthey used that particular service,\nthat particular device sensibly.\n\n262\n00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:36.450\nWhereas if we didn't allow access, then\nthey would actually try and abuse that.\n\n263\n00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:44.630\nAnd so when we talk about openness,\nwe have to be honest with security.\n\n264\n00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:47.060\nCustomer organizations tend not to be.\n\n265\n00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:52.870\nThey don't like to be honest with the way\nthat the users want to use their services.\n\n266\n00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:57.450\nAnd they will want to demonstrate that\nyes, all of their users are out here.\n\n267\n00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.370\nSo all of the security policies.\n\n268\n00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.530\nBut the reality of the situation\nmay be completely different.\n\n269\n00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.780\nAnd this is what we mean by openness and\nhonest.\n\n270\n00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.750\nBe open and honest with the way\nthat you use things and open and\n\n271\n00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.545\nhonest with the way things work.\n\n272\n00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:14.610\nI always say to people\nthat what I can do is,\n\n273\n00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:19.030\nI can help you get from here to here,\nno problem at all.\n\n274\n00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:24.340\nBut if the reality of the situation is\nthis that you're actually down here, then\n\n275\n00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:28.580\nme trying to make an improvement that gets\nfrom here to here is never going to work,\n\n276\n00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:33.420\nbecause if you're really at this\nlevel it's not going to help you.\n\n277\n00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.570\nI need to understand.\n\n278\n00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.690\nIf I'm doing an assessment for\nyou when it comes to security, or\n\n279\n00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:43.240\nany other type of assessment, I need\nto understand where you are right now.\n\n280\n00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.970\nAnd this is why we come into being\nhonest and being open about security.\n\n281\n00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:54.288\nI also really believe that what we have\nto do is be honest with people and\n\n282\n00:17:54.288 --> 00:17:58.256\nbe open with people about why,\nabout justifying why.\n\n283\n00:17:58.256 --> 00:18:02.484\nBecause quite often, we will impose\nregulations on security that say you can't\n\n284\n00:18:02.484 --> 00:18:04.450\ndo this and you can't do that.\n\n285\n00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.580\nAnd we don't tell people why, and if you\ndon't tell people why, they will try and\n\n286\n00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.750\nfind a way around.\n\n287\n00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:12.570\nBut if we can explain,\nif we can justify why we\n\n288\n00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:17.350\nundertake certain security measures,\nthen believe me,\n\n289\n00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:21.637\nwe find the security\ngets followed a lot more,\n\n290\n00:18:21.637 --> 00:18:26.615\nbut security policies are actually\nadhered to as opposed to bypassed.\n\n291\n00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.470\nSo what about then any other risks,\nany other challenges that we have?\n\n292\n00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.220\nWell you know what\nthe biggest challenge is?\n\n293\n00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:37.878\nIt's this one.\n\n294\n00:18:37.878 --> 00:18:44.098\nIs your SIAM ecosystem working\nefficiently and effectively?\n\n295\n00:18:44.098 --> 00:18:47.570\nI think so, I think it's good.\n\n296\n00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.140\nIt works well.\n\n297\n00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.670\nIt seems to, everybody talks to each\nother and I don't get any complaints.\n\n298\n00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:57.520\nIs that really a sufficient\nmeasurement of success?\n\n299\n00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.270\nI don't think so.\n\n300\n00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:04.650\nAll right, we have to be able to\ndemonstrate that we have achieved,\n\n301\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:08.070\nand that we are continuing\nto achieve efficiency and\n\n302\n00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.060\neffectiveness with our services.\n\n303\n00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:15.910\nAnd we have to demonstrate that we\nare delivering value to our customer.\n\n304\n00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:22.210\nSo the only way to measure\nthe success of the SIAM\n\n305\n00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:27.710\necosystem is to ensure that\nright at the very beginning,\n\n306\n00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.700\nthat we create a performance\nmanagement framework.\n\n307\n00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.380\nWe create a reporting framework and\n\n308\n00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:40.310\nthat we create an objective for\nthe SIAM ecosystem.\n\n309\n00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:46.730\nAnd that objective simply states this\nis what the customer defines as value.\n\n310\n00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.890\nThis is what we want to achieve.\n\n311\n00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:51.520\nAnd this is how we\nare going to measure it.\n\n312\n00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.760\nAnd this is when we're going\nto measure it, as well.\n\n313\n00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.120\nAnd on a regular basis,\n\n314\n00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:02.060\nwe need to be producing reports\nthat measure against our targets.\n\n315\n00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.860\nAnd service level management\nit gonna be key to this.\n\n316\n00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.550\nBecause service level management is going\nto be defining the service level targets\n\n317\n00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:09.900\nwithin which we will operate.\n\n318\n00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.720\nAnd the service level management will\nbe measuring those service level\n\n319\n00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.050\ntargets on a regular basis.\n\n320\n00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.300\nWe call them our SLAM charts for\nour RAG charts.\n\n321\n00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.750\nAnd it's only by analyzing\nthose SLAM charts and\n\n322\n00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:25.540\nthose RAG charts that we will\ndetermine whether we are actually\n\n323\n00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.250\nachieving what we\nare supposed to be achieving.\n\n324\n00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:34.550\nBut one of the most important metrics of\nall when it comes to measuring success for\n\n325\n00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:38.800\nthe SIAM ecosystem is\nour customer feedback.\n\n326\n00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:44.870\nIt's our surveys, because we have to be\nable to demonstrate that we are delivering\n\n327\n00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:49.330\nvalue and delivering value to\nthat customer organization.\n\n328\n00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:56.050\nSo what we've done in the last few\nepisodes is we've taken a look\n\n329\n00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:57.680\nat all of the risks,\n\n330\n00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.910\nto a successful SIAM ecosystem,.\n&gt;&gt; Now Joe,\n\n331\n00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:06.977\nare you telling me that we're finished?\n\n332\n00:21:06.977 --> 00:21:09.900\n&gt;&gt; Well, yes.\n\n333\n00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.336\nWell no, were not quite finished, no.\n\n334\n00:21:13.336 --> 00:21:18.391\nWhat we've done in these last few\nepisodes is that we have looked at\n\n335\n00:21:18.391 --> 00:21:23.980\nall of the risks and all of\nthe challenges to the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n336\n00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.770\nThe other thing that we've also done\nis that we have reached now the last\n\n337\n00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:34.860\nepisode of our SIAM foundation series.\n\n338\n00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.820\nWell okay, okay, hang on,\n\n339\n00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:42.530\nnot quite the last episodes,\nbecause now what you've got to do,\n\n340\n00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:47.900\nwhat you've got to do is\nyou've got to go and revise.\n\n341\n00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.375\nWell, what does that mean Justin?\n&gt;&gt; That means review.\n\n342\n00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:54.767\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna have to review all\nof these things, and admittedly so,\n\n343\n00:21:54.767 --> 00:21:56.500\nI've learned a great deal.\n\n344\n00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.920\nI've also learned some of the things\nthat well, I still need to learn, right?\n\n345\n00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.310\nI'm like, I found out some of\nthe things I don't know and\n\n346\n00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.450\nI gotta go figure those out.\n\n347\n00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:09.606\nBut maybe that's not the capacity for\nSIAM Foundation, but\n\n348\n00:22:09.606 --> 00:22:13.029\nevery time we take an exam,\nthere's always the,\n\n349\n00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:15.829\n[SOUND] what's the exam be like?\n&gt;&gt; Right, well,\n\n350\n00:22:15.829 --> 00:22:18.090\nwe've gotta remember that this\nis just foundation level.\n\n351\n00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:22.390\nSo before you try and get into too much\ndepth, we've had quite a few episodes at\n\n352\n00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.630\nthis foundation level and\nwe're still only at foundation level.\n\n353\n00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.500\nSo let's not try and analyze too much.\n\n354\n00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.030\nCuz we're gonna comeback and\nwe're gonna do a practitioner and\n\n355\n00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.200\nwe're actually going to look\nat things in much more depth.\n\n356\n00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.570\nBut yeah we've got this.\n\n357\n00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.760\nSo you're gonna have to comeback for\nthe next episode because\n\n358\n00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.180\nin the next episode I'm gonna talk\nto you about the exam itself.\n\n359\n00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:47.070\nI'm going to give you some hints and\ntips on how to approach the exam.\n\n360\n00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:52.270\nI'm also going to be checking that you\nhave revised, that you studied for\n\n361\n00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.370\nyour test.\n\n362\n00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:57.184\nAnd then in subsequent episodes\nwhat we're going to do is,\n\n363\n00:22:57.184 --> 00:23:00.326\nwe're going to go over\nthe sample paper as well.\n\n364\n00:23:00.326 --> 00:23:03.720\nThere is a sample paper, it's available\nin your downloadable material.\n\n365\n00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:09.440\nSo now is the time when you go away and\ndownload your sample paper and\n\n366\n00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:15.792\ncome back, watch the episode on how to\ndo the exam and how to take the test.\n\n367\n00:23:15.792 --> 00:23:20.598\nAnd then we've got a couple of episodes\nafter that where we will look at that\n\n368\n00:23:20.598 --> 00:23:24.120\nactual test paper itself and\nsee how well you did.\n\n369\n00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.260\nSo come straight back,\n\n370\n00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.120\nright, don't go anywhere.\n&gt;&gt; Well Jo I'm definitely going to\n\n371\n00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.530\nhave to go revise, I know that,\nI'm not using that word right and\n\n372\n00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.240\nI'll never use that word let's be honest.\n\n373\n00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.870\nBut part of studying for\nan exam is figuring out what you know,\n\n374\n00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:41.110\nwhat you don't know and\nthen kind of checking in with yourself.\n\n375\n00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:44.420\nSo you should definitely check out\nthose additional episodes where you\n\n376\n00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.660\ntake a look at the exams.\n\n377\n00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.720\nAnd also while you're\nin the course library,\n\n378\n00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:52.620\ncheck out the other kind of series that\nwe've talked about, like ITIL and Agile.\n\n379\n00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.120\nYou won't be disappointed.\n\n380\n00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.670\nBut for now, we're going to go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n381\n00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:58.570\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison\n\n382\n00:23:58.570 --> 00:23:59.450\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n383\n00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:00.584\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n384\n00:24:00.584 --> 00:24:07.102\n[MUSIC]\n\n385\n00:24:07.102 --> 00:24:10.511\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:18.120\nI'm Jo Peacock and I will be your\nguide through this next episode.\n\n4\n00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.375\nAnd in this next episode, what we will\nbe covering is some exam preparation.\n\n5\n00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:25.590\nBy now, congratulations.\n\n6\n00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.410\nYou have completed all of our\nseries on SIAM Foundation and\n\n7\n00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.240\nyou've learned quite a lot about SIAM,\nabout what it is,\n\n8\n00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.920\nabout all of the practices and\nthe processes within SIAM.\n\n9\n00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.540\nAnd now, you feel ready to\ntake the SIAM Foundation exam.\n\n10\n00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.650\nSo what do you need to know?\n\n11\n00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.917\nWell, the first thing that you need to\nknow is that there is a sample test\n\n12\n00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:49.960\navailable.\n\n13\n00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.050\nIt's available in your downloads and\nwe're gonna do that in a moment.\n\n14\n00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.820\nAnd in fact, in our next episode,\nwhen you come back for our next episode,\n\n15\n00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.350\nwe're gonna go through that.\n\n16\n00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.220\nBut I'm gonna tell you a little\nbit more about that in a second.\n\n17\n00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.700\nFor now, what I want to do is tell\nyou about the exam, the exam itself.\n\n18\n00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.560\nOn the screen in front of you, this is\njust a quick summary about the exam.\n\n19\n00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.650\nIt is what we call a simple\nmultiple choice exam.\n\n20\n00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.490\nYou will get 40 simple\nmultiple choice questions and\n\n21\n00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.610\nwhat I mean by simple is that\nyou'll get answers, either A, B, C,\n\n22\n00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.980\nor D or sometimes only A, B and\nC that is only one right answer.\n\n23\n00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.640\nSo you'll be asked to question and\nyou'll be asked to select the answer.\n\n24\n00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.700\nEither A, B, C or D if it's available.\n\n25\n00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.690\nThere is no negative marking, so\n\n26\n00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.960\nI don't want you to worry\nabout the negative marking.\n\n27\n00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.350\nI don't want you to worry that\nif you get something wrong,\n\n28\n00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.250\nthen that's gonna be an answer deducted.\n\n29\n00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.790\nBecause that's not the case.\n\n30\n00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.960\nYou either get it right or\nyou get it wrong.\n\n31\n00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.600\nAnd if you get it wrong,\nyou don't get a point.\n\n32\n00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.180\nIf you get it right, then you do and\nyou have got to get 65%,\n\n33\n00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.250\nwhich equates to that 26 out of 40\nin order to be able to pass and\n\n34\n00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.240\nthen gain your SIAM Foundation\naccreditation.\n\n35\n00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.800\nNow I hate to tell you,\nbut it's not open book.\n\n36\n00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.580\nThere are no electronic\naids as it says there.\n\n37\n00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.882\nWhat that basically means is no,\nyou cannot use your cellphone.\n\n38\n00:02:19.882 --> 00:02:21.290\nNo, you can't use Google.\n\n39\n00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.100\nYou can't use any of the supplementary\n\n40\n00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.250\nmaterial that's available\non the internet for you.\n\n41\n00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.736\nThis is simply just you and\nyour exam paper and\n\n42\n00:02:30.736 --> 00:02:34.330\nyou got 60 minutes to\nactually do this test.\n\n43\n00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.450\nI've got a tip for you and my tip is RTFQ.\n\n44\n00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.870\nWe will hold that bad acronym.\n\n45\n00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.930\nRead to the full question.\n\n46\n00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.900\nThere's nothing in the exam\nthat is going to trip you up.\n\n47\n00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.007\nAbsolutely nothing, but\n\n48\n00:02:54.007 --> 00:03:00.038\nyou do have to read every single word in\nthe question and every single word in\n\n49\n00:03:00.038 --> 00:03:05.130\nall of the answers in order to be\nable to get to the right answer.\n\n50\n00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.435\nThe questions are being asked in\na particular way for a reason and\n\n51\n00:03:09.435 --> 00:03:15.097\nwhat we're trying to do is we're trying to\ntest your understanding of the materials\n\n52\n00:03:15.097 --> 00:03:19.820\nthat we've covered in a previous episodes,\nand this entire series.\n\n53\n00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.020\nSo the questions you're\ngonna test that and\n\n54\n00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.920\nthe questions are going to ask you how\nyou would react in a certain situation.\n\n55\n00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.610\nSo they may give you\na specific scenario and\n\n56\n00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.020\nthey're going to test how you would\nreact in that particular scenario.\n\n57\n00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.360\nSo they are gonna make you think,\n\n58\n00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.000\nthey're going to make you apply what we've\ncovered in these particular episodes.\n\n59\n00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.690\nSo you get an hour to do your test.\n\n60\n00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.270\nWill it take an hour?\n\n61\n00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.980\nThat's a question I quite often get asked.\n\n62\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.670\nAnd to be perfectly honest,\nit may not take you a full hour.\n\n63\n00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.940\nIt shouldn't take you just 20 minutes,\nthough.\n\n64\n00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.540\nIf it's taking you just 20 minutes\nto go through 40 questions,\n\n65\n00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.620\nthen I have to warn you about\nreading the full question.\n\n66\n00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.240\nPlease give yourself the time to read\nevery single word in the question and\n\n67\n00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.290\nthen answer with your gut instinct,\nand don't change your answers.\n\n68\n00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.210\nInvariably, the majority of people and\n\n69\n00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.530\nI know there are lots of\nstatistics that can support this.\n\n70\n00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.880\nBut the majority of people that change\ntheir answers, change it to the wrong one.\n\n71\n00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.970\nSo don't change your answers.\n\n72\n00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.620\nGo with your gut instinct,\nthat's generally right.\n\n73\n00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.290\nSelect an answer and then leave it.\n\n74\n00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.830\nSo what about the contents\nthen of your exam?\n\n75\n00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.360\nWell, your exam, if we take a look\nat the screen in front of us now,\n\n76\n00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.720\nyou'll see that about 15% of the questions\n\n77\n00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.450\nare going to be on that introduction\nsection that we covered.\n\n78\n00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.950\nSo we've got a few episodes\nof the introduction to SIAM.\n\n79\n00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.550\nVery, very general questions.\n\n80\n00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.530\nQuestions about SIAM itself.\n\n81\n00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.570\nSIAM as an ecosystem,\nwhen we would use SIAM.\n\n82\n00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.139\nWhen it would be appropriate and\nwhat are the benefits to SIAM, and\n\n83\n00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.118\nwhat are the disadvantages of SIAM,\nthen we've got our SIAM roadmap and\n\n84\n00:05:09.118 --> 00:05:13.300\nabout 20% of our questions\nare going to be on the roadmap.\n\n85\n00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.050\nBy roadmap,\nwe mean that implementation roadmap.\n\n86\n00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.950\nSo think about how you\nwould implement SIAM.\n\n87\n00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.140\nThink about all of the things that we\ndiscussed, such as the benefit and\n\n88\n00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.780\nalso organizational change management too.\n\n89\n00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.190\nHow we see SIAM.\n\n90\n00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:40.170\nHow we actually communicate our advantages\nof the SIAM ecosystem to our business and\n\n91\n00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.180\nthen about 10% of our questions are going\nto be on roles and responsibilities.\n\n92\n00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.680\nSo think about our process owners and\nthink about our process managers, and\n\n93\n00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.110\nthen and of course also are stakeholders,\nand then we've got our SIAM practices.\n\n94\n00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.310\nSo in this particular section,\nwe've got 15% of my questions\n\n95\n00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.700\nare gonna be on the practices\nthat we covered in SIAM.\n\n96\n00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.180\nNow we did a very brief\nintroduction to our practices and\n\n97\n00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.570\nthese are our practices,\nour ethics should we say.\n\n98\n00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.890\nOur governance models for managing our\nprocesses and for managing our people, and\n\n99\n00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.220\nit's gonna be 15% of our questions\nare going to be on those practices.\n\n100\n00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.524\nAnd as I've said,\n\n101\n00:06:23.524 --> 00:06:28.333\nwe did a very short introduction to\nthose very early on in our series and\n\n102\n00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:33.320\nthen we looked at them in a lot more\ndetail a bit later on in our series too.\n\n103\n00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.698\nAnd then you'll see we've got 17.5% and\nthis is roughly 17.5%\n\n104\n00:06:38.698 --> 00:06:43.987\nare going to be on the processes, and\nwe've got quite a few episodes that\n\n105\n00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:49.350\nwe covered where we looked at\nthe processes that actually support SIAM.\n\n106\n00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.090\nOf course, bearing in mind that\nall of these processes and\n\n107\n00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:57.340\nthe practices to have got to be\na spread across our ecosystem.\n\n108\n00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:04.410\nSo these are processes that we have to\napply across the ecosystem itself with all\n\n109\n00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:10.170\nof our service providers and then we've\ngot our challenges, and our risks to SIAM.\n\n110\n00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.140\nThis is really important.\n\n111\n00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:18.720\nThe SIAM ecosystem is well, it can\nbe very complex ecosystem to manage.\n\n112\n00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.840\nAnd so we have about 17.5% of\nour questions are going to be\n\n113\n00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.220\non those challenges and\nthe risks to managing that SIAM ecosystem.\n\n114\n00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.948\nSo spend some time concentrating on the\ncomplexities of the ecosystem itself and\n\n115\n00:07:33.948 --> 00:07:38.121\nconsidering how we would manage\nthe relationships between our service\n\n116\n00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:38.900\nproviders.\n\n117\n00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:44.254\nAnd then lastly, about 5% of your\nquestions are going to be related\n\n118\n00:07:44.254 --> 00:07:49.380\nto other practices and\nthe relationship to other practices.\n\n119\n00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:55.010\nAnd by other practices, I mean, server\nmanagement methodology such as iTil and\n\n120\n00:07:55.010 --> 00:08:00.760\niSore 2000 and\nalso maybe even Lean and Agile also.\n\n121\n00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:06.830\nSo that's all going to be on\nour SIAM Foundation test.\n\n122\n00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.290\nThe percentages that you've got there.\n\n123\n00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.450\nThe waiting that you've\ngot there is just a very,\n\n124\n00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:18.940\nvery high-level guideline as to\nwhat to expect in your test.\n\n125\n00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.260\nThat's not to say that, that's\nexactly what your test is going to be.\n\n126\n00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.030\nBut that's what you should\nexpect in your test.\n\n127\n00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.110\nSo now of course,\n\n128\n00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.700\nthen there's the question of how\ndo you register for your test?\n\n129\n00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.920\nWell, I'm now gonna take\nyou to a website and\n\n130\n00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.650\nthe website is Exin website.\n\n131\n00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:42.731\nThis is our examining board and what I\nwant to do now and if we can blow this\n\n132\n00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:47.491\nfull screen and I'll show you how\nwe actually book our SIAM exams.\n\n133\n00:08:47.491 --> 00:08:51.910\nSo we simply go to at the top,\nwe have our exin.com.\n\n134\n00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.675\nIf I can find my mouse, here we go.\n\n135\n00:08:54.675 --> 00:08:59.610\nExin.com has a website and\nthat's where we need to go.\n\n136\n00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:05.070\nAnd then once we're at our exin.com\nwebsite, then simply we book an exam.\n\n137\n00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.900\nNow if you don't already have an account,\n\n138\n00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.800\nthen what you will need to do is\nyou will need to create an account.\n\n139\n00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.400\nSo we simply click on book an exam and\nthis pop-up window will come up.\n\n140\n00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:21.248\nUnderneath the qualification program,\n\n141\n00:09:21.248 --> 00:09:25.270\nyou need to look for EXIN BCS SIAM.\n\n142\n00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.710\nExin is the examining board.\n\n143\n00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:31.490\nBCS is another examining board,\nit is the British Computer Society.\n\n144\n00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:36.500\nSo we simply click there and then it will\nask you to select your certification,\n\n145\n00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.570\neither the foundation which\nis what we're on right now or\n\n146\n00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.310\nthe professional certification.\n\n147\n00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:46.400\nNow obviously, we are on the foundation\nat this particular minute in time.\n\n148\n00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.570\nSo you select that.\n\n149\n00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.940\nYou will select your country.\n\n150\n00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.930\nI don't know what country you're in,\nbut you do.\n\n151\n00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.790\nSo select your country.\n\n152\n00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.630\nSelect a test center.\n\n153\n00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:02.880\nThis is a paper-based exam, so you will\nneed to go into a parametric test center.\n\n154\n00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.070\nSo this is why they ask you\nto select your country.\n\n155\n00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.370\nSo you select your country.\n\n156\n00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.170\nNow, so let's say that we are in.\n\n157\n00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.970\nWhere are we?\n\n158\n00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:21.260\nWell, in case you hadn't guessed by\nthe accent, I think I'm gonna pick UK and\n\n159\n00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:26.544\nthen we'll go into our test center and\nwe can select, well, Exin anywhere.\n\n160\n00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:35.400\nSo Exin anywhere allows us then to select\na pro metric center closest to us or\n\n161\n00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.290\nto do the exam online if that\nis available in your country,\n\n162\n00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.500\nwhich in the UK it is and\nthen we select a language.\n\n163\n00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:49.880\nThis is our own business language,\nso our regular business language.\n\n164\n00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.400\nThat's what we select for our tests.\n\n165\n00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:57.560\nSo I am going to select English and you\nwill see, it will give me the price and\n\n166\n00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.760\nthe price there is in the local\ncurrency dependent on\n\n167\n00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.030\nthe country that you have\nactually registered in.\n\n168\n00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.110\nSo and then we just click on Register.\n\n169\n00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:14.390\nNow I'm not gonna do that, because I\nalready have and Exin credential setup.\n\n170\n00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.800\nSo I'm not gonna go through this with you,\nbut it's at this point in time that\n\n171\n00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.840\nyou just simply click on Register and\nthen it will ask you for\n\n172\n00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.750\nyour registration details and\nI don't wanna be charged for another exam.\n\n173\n00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:29.970\nSo I'm not gonna do that now, but\nselect your registration details.\n\n174\n00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:36.080\nIt will then ask you for payment details\nand then it will ask you to select a date,\n\n175\n00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.650\nand time which is suitable for\nyou to take your test.\n\n176\n00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:45.380\nNow, you can take your test at any\npoint in time that's suitable for you.\n\n177\n00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:50.760\nI would always recommend and this is\njust my personal recommendation here.\n\n178\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.632\nI would always recommend that you\ntake your test as soon after you have\n\n179\n00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:57.480\ncompleted your studies.\n\n180\n00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.260\nAnd soon after you have\ncompleted your sample paper and\n\n181\n00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.451\nyou've completed watching our\nseries as you possibly can,\n\n182\n00:12:05.451 --> 00:12:10.580\nyou want to do your test while\nit's still fresh in your mind.\n\n183\n00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.770\nBut of course, one of the beauties of\nhaving this series here is the fact that\n\n184\n00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:18.340\nyou can just dip in and\nout of this to suit yourselves.\n\n185\n00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.770\nAnd so you can, if you want to,\n\n186\n00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:24.440\nwatch whichever episode you want to\nwatch prior to taking your test.\n\n187\n00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.840\nSo now that we've looked at the actual\ntest itself, what it's made up of?\n\n188\n00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.725\nDon't forget, it's 40 questions and\nit's an hour in length and\n\n189\n00:12:35.725 --> 00:12:38.220\nyou've got to get 65% to pass.\n\n190\n00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:43.140\nSo now, we're going to take\na look at the sample paper.\n\n191\n00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:47.120\nAnd in the downloadable material that you\nhave that accompanies this particular\n\n192\n00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.820\nclass, you will see an Exin sample paper.\n\n193\n00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:56.370\nSo what I want you to do is I want you\nto download that sample paper right now.\n\n194\n00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.630\nAnd now is the time when you're\ngoing to do this sample paper.\n\n195\n00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.555\nAnd when we come back in our next episode,\n\n196\n00:13:01.555 --> 00:13:04.720\nwe're gonna go through\nthe answers to the sample paper.\n\n197\n00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.750\nNow just in case you've missed anything,\n\n198\n00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.330\nthe reason why I mention that\nthe real test is 40 questions\n\n199\n00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:15.530\nis because your sample paper is\nonly 20 questions in length.\n\n200\n00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:19.870\nIt's just to give you a flavor for\nwhat the real test will be.\n\n201\n00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.680\nBut nevertheless,\nI want you to download it.\n\n202\n00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.510\nNow is the time.\n\n203\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.000\nGo away, download that sample paper.\n\n204\n00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.310\nAnd when we come back in our next episode,\non our next episodes,\n\n205\n00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:32.420\nwe're gonna go through all of the answers\nto the questions in that sample paper.\n\n206\n00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.830\nAnd I'm gonna tell you what episode\nthat you can find these answers in and\n\n207\n00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:37.210\nwhere to look for for\n\n208\n00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:41.320\nthe answers just in case there's something\nthat you want to refresh your memory with.\n\n209\n00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.607\nSo for now, I'm gonna sign out and\nI'm gonna say,\n\n210\n00:13:46.607 --> 00:13:49.330\nI'll see you in the next episode.\n\n211\n00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.510\nBut thank you very much for watching.\n\n212\n00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:56.747\nI've been Jo Peacock and this is\nITProTV and we'll see you next time.\n\n213\n00:13:56.747 --> 00:14:02.267\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

foundation\nexam review with IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.610\nSo you have now completed your\nSIAM foundation sample exam,\n\n5\n00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.400\nso congratulations.\n\n6\n00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.250\nDo you wanna see how you got on?\n\n7\n00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.340\nWell, if you remember, the downloadable\nexam is only 20 questions, okay?\n\n8\n00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.090\nYour real test is not going\nto be just 20 questions.\n\n9\n00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.410\nIt's going to be a full 40 questions.\n\n10\n00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.090\nAnd you've got to get\n26 out of 40 to pass.\n\n11\n00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.010\nWhich means that seems we've got 20\nquestions here, then you need to be\n\n12\n00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.515\ngetting at least 13 out of the 20\nin order to be on a track to pass.\n\n13\n00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.560\nThis is the sample paper\nthat is available to you.\n\n14\n00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.490\nIt's also downloadable\nfrom the XN website,\n\n15\n00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.640\nthat's the examining board's website.\n\n16\n00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.810\nAnd what we gonna do right know is in\nthis episode and in our subsequent\n\n17\n00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.665\nepisode as well in part two were going\nto be going through each question.\n\n18\n00:01:07.665 --> 00:01:09.524\nWe're gonna go through it bit by bit,\n\n19\n00:01:09.524 --> 00:01:14.250\nwe're going to pull it a part and\nwe're gonna make sure that your understand\n\n20\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.790\nreally why that answer\nis the right answer.\n\n21\n00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.790\nNow, you do have some rationales that\naccompany your downloadable material,\n\n22\n00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.730\nas well.\n\n23\n00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.160\nBut sometimes it's helpful\njust to go through it, right?\n\n24\n00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.050\nYou don't just want to read something.\n\n25\n00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.860\nSo, what I'm gonna do,\nis I'm not just going to give you\n\n26\n00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.820\nthe rationals that are listed in the book,\nwe're actually going to dissect this.\n\n27\n00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.340\nAnd as I said,\nwe're gonna go through this,\n\n28\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.800\nand we're gonna work out exactly what\neach, which, what each question means.\n\n29\n00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.350\nSo on, let's start off then at a very good\nplace to start, with question number one.\n\n30\n00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.020\nNow, the format of these\nparticular slides,\n\n31\n00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.440\nwhat you have here is you've got the\nquestion and then obviously the answers,\n\n32\n00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.970\nand then you have got\nthe rational that's underneath.\n\n33\n00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.430\nAnd the rational, I just wanna draw\nyour attention to that right now.\n\n34\n00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.670\nThat's the small font at the bottom there,\nand\n\n35\n00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.670\nit actually tells you at which point,\nwhich chapter, in\n\n36\n00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.970\nthe SIAM foundation book\nthe answer is to be found at.\n\n37\n00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.900\nSo if you do have\nthe SIAM foundation book,\n\n38\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.480\nif you have managed to obtain a copy\nof that, it is not obligatory.\n\n39\n00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.600\nIt's not mandatory for the test, but\n\n40\n00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.920\nit just shows you where\nthat reference came from.\n\n41\n00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.640\nAnd at which point In the SIAM\necosystem this would be applied.\n\n42\n00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.090\nSo, let's start off with\nquestion number one.\n\n43\n00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.529\nWhat is a responsibility of a service\nprovider in a SIAM ecosystem?\n\n44\n00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.250\nNow as you can see, the answer that\nhas been highlighted there is A.\n\n45\n00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.620\nIt's delivery.\n\n46\n00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.750\nIt's not end to end integration, and it's\nnot governance, and it's not strategy.\n\n47\n00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.820\nLet's have a look through\nall of these answers, and\n\n48\n00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.180\nlet's see why A is the right answer.\n\n49\n00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.220\nSo the responsibility\nof a service provider.\n\n50\n00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.550\nThink about what a service provider does.\n\n51\n00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.240\nA service provider, well the SIAM\necosystem, we have the customer\n\n52\n00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.928\nthen we have the service integrator layer,\nwhich may be internal or\n\n53\n00:03:16.928 --> 00:03:22.820\nit may be external and then underneath\nwe have individual service providers.\n\n54\n00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:29.780\nAnd the individual service providers have\na responsibility to provide their service.\n\n55\n00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.620\nThey have a responsibility for\ncollaboration also,\n\n56\n00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.760\nbut they have a responsibility for\ntheir specific service.\n\n57\n00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.580\nSo they have a responsibility for\nthe delivery of their specific service.\n\n58\n00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.130\nIn terms of end-to-end integration,\nwell, we've got the customer,\n\n59\n00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.900\nwe've got the service integrator,\nthere's a hint, and\n\n60\n00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.120\nthen we've got all of our\nservice providers, and\n\n61\n00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.530\nof course, it's the service integrator\nthat takes responsibility for\n\n62\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.090\nensuring that all of these service\nproviders are integrated and for\n\n63\n00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.890\nensuring that they collaborate, so\nthe end to end responsibility or\n\n64\n00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.436\nthe end to end integration is the\nresponsibility of the service integrator.\n\n65\n00:04:13.436 --> 00:04:17.483\nNow in terms of governance and strategy,\n\n66\n00:04:17.483 --> 00:04:24.535\nagain I would expect the service\nintegrator to take a responsibility for\n\n67\n00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:30.400\ngovernance, and also for\na strategy of IT as a whole.\n\n68\n00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.990\nNow, it's really important that in\nan IT environment, in the ecosystem,\n\n69\n00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:44.350\nwe align our strategy to the strategy\nof the customer, the one at the top.\n\n70\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.090\nYeah, because that's who it\nis that we're supporting.\n\n71\n00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.340\nWe are aligning ourselves to the business,\nwe're supporting the business.\n\n72\n00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.390\nAnd we are ensuring that they\ncan achieve their outcomes,\n\n73\n00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.990\nwe're facilitating those outcomes.\n\n74\n00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.970\nSo despite the fact though obviously\nat the integration layer we're going to\n\n75\n00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.490\nset governance practices for\nall of our service providers.\n\n76\n00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.000\nThen we're going to set the strategy for\nour services as a whole.\n\n77\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.030\nNevertheless, we have to be aligned with\nthe customer, with the organization.\n\n78\n00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.560\nSo governance and strategy,\n\n79\n00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.580\nagain, are going to be a responsibility\nof the service integrator.\n\n80\n00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.190\nSo the answer to this question is\nobviously A because all of the others\n\n81\n00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.460\nare the responsibility of\nthe service integrator.\n\n82\n00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.330\nHow did you do with that?\n\n83\n00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.470\nOkay, well let's take a look\nat question two then.\n\n84\n00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.133\nEnd to end measurement in a SIAM\nenvironment, in a SIAM ecosystem.\n\n85\n00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.810\nEnd to end measurement is\nmeasuring an entire service.\n\n86\n00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.400\nWhat this means is,\ndoes this service meet or\n\n87\n00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.270\nexceed the targets that are defined\nin the service level agreements and\n\n88\n00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.440\nin the contracts.\n\n89\n00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.350\nIn other words,\nthose service level targets.\n\n90\n00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.110\nNow in quite a few of our episodes, we've\ntalked about target such as availability\n\n91\n00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.040\ntargets where a service has to be\ndelivered between the hours or\n\n92\n00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.600\navailable between the hours of 8 AM and\n20:00, for instance.\n\n93\n00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.350\nOr when there has been an incident,\n\n94\n00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.470\nwell that incident has to be\nresponded to within four hours.\n\n95\n00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.580\nAnd of course that has to be responded to\n\n96\n00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.810\namongst all of our service providers,\nor by all of our service providers.\n\n97\n00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.700\nBecause we've got the customer layer and\n\n98\n00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.200\nthen we've got the service\nintegrator layer.\n\n99\n00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.620\nAnd then we've got the service providers.\n\n100\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.670\nAnd the four-hour response, well that sits\nbetween the integrator and the customer.\n\n101\n00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:51.960\nAnd that four hours,\n\n102\n00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.140\neverything that happens under here has\nto happen within those four hours.\n\n103\n00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.120\nSo, end to end measurement\n\n104\n00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.280\nis measurement of absolutely everything\nthat's happening at this level.\n\n105\n00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.670\nEverything, including\nthe measurement of any availability.\n\n106\n00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.840\nIncluding the measurement\nof any process metrics.\n\n107\n00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.689\nIt's everything that happened,\nit's the end to end view of a service.\n\n108\n00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:27.470\nAverage time taken to resolve a problem\nby one particular service provider.\n\n109\n00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.540\nWell, that's not, that's just\none particular metric, isn't it?\n\n110\n00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.310\nIt's not an end-to-end service.\n\n111\n00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.030\nIt doesn't show me how the end-to-end\nservice is performing.\n\n112\n00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.180\nIt shows me how quickly\nI resolve a problem.\n\n113\n00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.500\nI have got a few issues with that as well.\n\n114\n00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.260\nBecause if we go back and\nlook at our processes,\n\n115\n00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.887\nsometimes we chose not\nto resolve problems.\n\n116\n00:07:49.887 --> 00:07:53.218\nGoing back to those episodes where\nwe looked at an incident and\n\n117\n00:07:53.218 --> 00:07:55.909\nwe had an episode where we\nlooked at a problem, and\n\n118\n00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:59.130\nyou will see that a problem is\nthe root cause of an incident.\n\n119\n00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.834\nAnd sometimes we don't\nalways fix the problem.\n\n120\n00:08:01.834 --> 00:08:04.384\nSo, average time to resolve a problem,\n\n121\n00:08:04.384 --> 00:08:09.390\nthat's not actually a metric\nthat we're really interested in.\n\n122\n00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.940\nBecause sometimes,\nwe just wanna fix the incident.\n\n123\n00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.110\nWe don't want to resolve the problems.\n\n124\n00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.120\nSo that one wouldn't be ab\nappropriate metric anyway, but\n\n125\n00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.180\nit would only measure one\nfacet of the service.\n\n126\n00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.130\nComparison of internal versus\nexternal serivce providers.\n\n127\n00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.343\nDoes that measure any given service?\n\n128\n00:08:27.343 --> 00:08:32.390\nDoes that give us an end to end\nmeasurement of the entire environment?\n\n129\n00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.710\nThat just gives us a comparison and\n\n130\n00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:39.154\ngiven that every single service\nprovider has been selected for its own,\n\n131\n00:08:39.154 --> 00:08:44.570\nunique abilities, and\nits own unique skills or\n\n132\n00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:49.430\nspecialisms, then really, can we do that?\n\n133\n00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.750\nCan we compare one service\nprovider against another?\n\n134\n00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.920\nNot if they're doing different things.\n\n135\n00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.780\nYou're comparing apples to oranges.\n\n136\n00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.410\nYou can't do that.\n\n137\n00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.066\nSo that one doesn't even make any sense.\n\n138\n00:09:02.066 --> 00:09:06.998\nAnd what about how many incidents have\nbeen raised by a particular business\n\n139\n00:09:06.998 --> 00:09:09.670\ndivision or particular business unit?\n\n140\n00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.950\nDoes that shows us an end\nto end service comparison?\n\n141\n00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.320\nNo, it doesn't show us end\nto end service at all,\n\n142\n00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.830\nwhat it shows us is what one particular\nbusiness unit is experiencing.\n\n143\n00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.140\nSo end to end measurement\nmeans the entire service.\n\n144\n00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.830\nIt means everything.\n\n145\n00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:35.030\nAnd the only one, the only answer there\nthat encompasses everything, is D,\n\n146\n00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:39.140\nthe responsiveness of the service\nagainst those service-level targets.\n\n147\n00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.014\nThe ones that are agreed in the SLA.\n\n148\n00:09:43.014 --> 00:09:48.180\nSo question number three there,\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n149\n00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.290\nNow on few episodes now,\nwe have talked about CSI and\n\n150\n00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:56.350\nwe've talked about the difference\nbetween continual and continuous.\n\n151\n00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.571\nAnd continuous service is iterative,\n\n152\n00:09:59.571 --> 00:10:04.970\nrepeatable improvement with each\nimprovement building on the last.\n\n153\n00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.760\nSo what is the purpose of the process?\n\n154\n00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.660\nWell, as you can see,\nthe answer here is C,\n\n155\n00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.840\nit's about providing a consistent\nmethod of quantifying, tracking and\n\n156\n00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:20.590\nmanaging the delivery of\nimprovement activity.\n\n157\n00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:25.372\nContinual service improvement means\neach improvement building on the last,\n\n158\n00:10:25.372 --> 00:10:28.424\nwhich means that we've got\nto be able to measure.\n\n159\n00:10:28.424 --> 00:10:33.155\nBecause I think so is not a really\ngood measurement as to whether we've\n\n160\n00:10:33.155 --> 00:10:35.420\nachieved an improvement or not.\n\n161\n00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.849\nOr where are you right now,\nwhat is your current baseline?\n\n162\n00:10:37.849 --> 00:10:38.759\nWell, I think I'm here.\n\n163\n00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:41.330\nThat's not really very good, is it?\n\n164\n00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.650\nWe don't want that.\n\n165\n00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:47.240\nWhat we want is an accurate\ndepiction of where we are,\n\n166\n00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.650\nthat's our baseline,\nthis is where I am right now.\n\n167\n00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:53.560\nSo then I can accurately say,\nokay, I'm now here.\n\n168\n00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.660\nSo this is how far I've come.\n\n169\n00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.210\nSo measurement is key to CSI,\nabsolutely key, so\n\n170\n00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:03.250\nproviding a consistent method of\nquantifying and tracking and managing.\n\n171\n00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.058\nWell, of course,\nwe want consistency in our metrics.\n\n172\n00:11:06.058 --> 00:11:10.950\nYou can’t compare if you\ndon’t have the consistency.\n\n173\n00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.500\nBut let’s just take a look at A and\nB and D, and\n\n174\n00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.300\njust make sure that we\ncan eliminate those.\n\n175\n00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:21.808\nEncouraging and incentivize service\nproviders, that’s not a purpose of CSI.\n\n176\n00:11:21.808 --> 00:11:27.170\nWe might choose to do that and\ncertainly, in previous episodes,\n\n177\n00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:34.040\nI've mentioned penalties and incentives,\nand we may choose to incentivize.\n\n178\n00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.560\nBut that's not a purpose of CSI.\n\n179\n00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.956\nIt might be an ad hoc activity or\nit might be something that we do, but\n\n180\n00:11:39.956 --> 00:11:42.513\nit's not certainly know its purpose.\n\n181\n00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:50.447\nB is ensuring that CSI is on the agendas\nof the SIAM governance boards.\n\n182\n00:11:50.447 --> 00:11:53.090\nAgain, it's not a purpose.\n\n183\n00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.150\nI'm happy to ensure that CSI's\non the agenda of the board.\n\n184\n00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.320\nBut if the board only meets\nonce every three months,\n\n185\n00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.210\nthen is it really going to be discussed?\n\n186\n00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.080\nAnd just because something's on\nthe agenda doesn't mean that something's\n\n187\n00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.860\ngoing to happen.\n\n188\n00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:12.040\nSo that's not necessarily a true\nreflection of what CSI really is.\n\n189\n00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.190\nAnd what CSI is,\nis continual service improvement.\n\n190\n00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.740\nIt's actually about the improving and\ndemonstrating that we've improved.\n\n191\n00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.830\nAnd then sharing lessons learned across\nall parties in the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n192\n00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:30.060\nThat might sound like a great idea and\nwe do want to share our lessons learned.\n\n193\n00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.100\nBut we also have to bear in mind that\nthere are certain things like data\n\n194\n00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:39.030\nprotection laws, where we might not\nchoose to share all of our data and\n\n195\n00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.530\nshare all of our lessons learned.\n\n196\n00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.700\nWe might be quite happy with that,\nbut across all parties and\n\n197\n00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.535\nall stakeholders, really?\n\n198\n00:12:46.535 --> 00:12:50.850\n[SOUND] I'm not too sure that all of our\nservice providers are going to be happy\n\n199\n00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:55.110\nsharing all of their information with\nall of the other service providers.\n\n200\n00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.230\nThat one's gonna be\na tricky one to manage, and\n\n201\n00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.880\nI know that the service integrator\nshould manage that, but\n\n202\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.000\nnevertheless, it's not something that's\ngonna be practical in the real world.\n\n203\n00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.370\nSo the purpose of CSI is, yes, to ensure\nthat, we have continued collaboration\n\n204\n00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:17.090\nand that we continually realign\nourselves with the needs\n\n205\n00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:22.260\nof the organization so\nthat we continually improve.\n\n206\n00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.420\nWell, you have to think about relevance\nand you have to think about whether that\n\n207\n00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.410\nis practically possible, and\nit's not always feasible.\n\n208\n00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.520\nSo the answer here is C.\n\n209\n00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.540\nIt's about a consistent method of\nquantifying, tracking and managing.\n\n210\n00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.930\nLet's take a look at\nquestion number 4 then.\n\n211\n00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.430\nSo it's given us a little\nbit of a scenario here, so\n\n212\n00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:44.970\nlet's take a read of the scenario.\n\n213\n00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:49.050\nWe have a customer organization and they\nwant to complete implementation of their\n\n214\n00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:54.290\nSIAM model in the shortest possible time.\n\n215\n00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:58.130\nSo they want to move to a SIAM ecosystem,\n\n216\n00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.620\na SIAM management methodology,\nin a short time.\n\n217\n00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:07.410\nWell, [LAUGH] that suggests to me that we\nneed to do it all at the same time then.\n\n218\n00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.330\nSo we need to implement\nvery quickly the processes.\n\n219\n00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.530\nThat's a big bang approach, isn't it?\n\n220\n00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.280\nIt's very risky though.\n\n221\n00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.620\nWell, it says that they're\nprepared to take risks.\n\n222\n00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.590\nOkay, in that case then, if they're\nprepared to take risks, then that's fine.\n\n223\n00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.340\nSo let's go and see what options\nwe've got available to us.\n\n224\n00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.150\nWell, obviously, the right answer\nthere is that big bang approach.\n\n225\n00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.030\nWell, let's take a look, and this is\nexactly what I said is we're reading\n\n226\n00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.130\nthrough these questions by the way.\n\n227\n00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:38.040\nI'm expecting you, as you're reading\nthrough these questions, to be thinking\n\n228\n00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.940\nabout the potential answer to the question\nbefore you've even seen the options.\n\n229\n00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:49.240\nHopefully, by watching our episodes,\nyou should be at a point where when\n\n230\n00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.570\nyou read the question, you should already\nhave the answer formulated in your mind.\n\n231\n00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.390\nSo they want to implement\nit as quickly as possible.\n\n232\n00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.520\nThey're prepared to take risks.\n\n233\n00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.580\nThen, why shouldn't we appoint\nour service providers early?\n\n234\n00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.400\nPossibly because we've already got\nservice providers in place and\n\n235\n00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.940\ntherefore they're already appointed.\n\n236\n00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:15.215\nOr possibly because if we're\ntrying to implement a SIAM\n\n237\n00:15:15.215 --> 00:15:20.360\neco-system then it's not just about\nappointing service providers.\n\n238\n00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.960\nSure, we want to appoint\nservice providers but\n\n239\n00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.150\nwe've gotta get the practices in place.\n\n240\n00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.650\nThis is what implementing SIAM means.\n\n241\n00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:31.030\nIt's about getting the practices and\nthe process is in place,\n\n242\n00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:35.640\nnot necessarily functional\nareas in the service providers.\n\n243\n00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.650\nWe could bring those on\nboard a little bit later.\n\n244\n00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:43.980\nBut then as we bring each service\nprovided into our environment,\n\n245\n00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.460\nthen we'd tell them\nwhich practices we have.\n\n246\n00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:51.289\nAnd we showed them our processes, and\nwe ask them to adhere to our processes.\n\n247\n00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:59.302\nRemember the service providers\nare proving a service for us.\n\n248\n00:15:59.302 --> 00:16:02.752\nThis is not about us doing what\nthe service providers want,\n\n249\n00:16:02.752 --> 00:16:04.960\nthey are providing us with a service.\n\n250\n00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:12.130\nSo, in completing an implementation of\nthe SIAM model as quickly as possible,\n\n251\n00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.330\nwould we use organizational\nchange management?\n\n252\n00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.290\nYes, we would.\n\n253\n00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:21.310\nBut it's not going to\nachieve an implementation,\n\n254\n00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.770\nit's gonna facilitate an implementation.\n\n255\n00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:30.360\nOrganizational change management, is about\naddressing the people side of change.\n\n256\n00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:34.310\nAn organizational change\nmanagement is looking at\n\n257\n00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.770\nhow we bring our people on board.\n\n258\n00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:41.140\nHow we demonstrate that this\nis actually a good idea, and\n\n259\n00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.050\nthis is something that's\nbeneficial to our organization.\n\n260\n00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:49.470\nAnd so therefore,\nthis is about the people side of things.\n\n261\n00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.670\nWell okay, that's great.\n\n262\n00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.930\nIn isolation but it's not going to\nimplement SIAM because you still need\n\n263\n00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:59.630\nthe practices and the processes to\nbe able to implement the ecosystem.\n\n264\n00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.600\nSo nevertheless,\ndespite the fact we need OCM,\n\n265\n00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.930\nthe question is what should\nthe organization do to\n\n266\n00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:13.080\nachieve the implementation of the SIAM\nmodel in the shortest possible time?\n\n267\n00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:18.240\nOCM's gonna give us partway, but\nit's not gonna give us the whole thing.\n\n268\n00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:23.390\nAnd then let's take a look at\nthe phased implementation, which is D.\n\n269\n00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:27.630\nWell, a phased implementation is\ndefinitely not going to give us\n\n270\n00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:31.250\nan implementation in\nthe shortest possible time.\n\n271\n00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.460\nAnd of course phased does\nthe opposite of a big bang approach.\n\n272\n00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.970\nSo you've either got to pick B or D.\n\n273\n00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:40.900\nAnd phased is not gonna allow us to\nachieve it in a short period of time.\n\n274\n00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.090\nSo of course the answer is B.\n\n275\n00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:49.680\nTo question number five, what is\nthe earliest stage of the SIAM roadmap,\n\n276\n00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.470\nso think implementation,\n\n277\n00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.980\nis going to be affected by the challenge\nof building the business case?\n\n278\n00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.660\nWell, think about the stages that we have.\n\n279\n00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.910\nWe have discovery and strategy, plan and\n\n280\n00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:06.700\nbuild, then implement,\nthan run and improve.\n\n281\n00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.685\nSo if we use a bit of a exam\ntechnique on this one,\n\n282\n00:18:08.685 --> 00:18:11.035\nyou'll see that the question\nsays the earliest stage.\n\n283\n00:18:11.035 --> 00:18:15.090\nWell, the earliest stage is Discovery and\nStrategy.\n\n284\n00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:19.590\nBut it also says to be affected by the\nchallenge of building the business case.\n\n285\n00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:23.690\nWell, it's in Discovery and\nStrategy where we build the business case.\n\n286\n00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.950\nSo not only is that the earliest stage,\nbut\n\n287\n00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:28.510\nit's also where we build\nthe business case too.\n\n288\n00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.970\nBecause the business case has got to be\nimproved before we can then move into\n\n289\n00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:36.900\nthe Plan and Build and\nthen the implementation.\n\n290\n00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:42.430\nSo this is where we start on our business\ncase, so the answer there is definitely A.\n\n291\n00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.410\nSo again,\n\n292\n00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:51.870\nwe are talking about organizational\nchange management in question number six.\n\n293\n00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:56.660\nIn which stage of the SIAM roadmap does\norganizational change management commence?\n\n294\n00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:03.120\nOrganizational change management is\nabout the people side of change.\n\n295\n00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.370\nSo when do we start to\nconsider the people?\n\n296\n00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.630\nIs it during discovery and strategy?\n\n297\n00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.490\nNo, it's not.\n\n298\n00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:18.170\nDuring discovery and\nstrategy we're considering a strategy for\n\n299\n00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:22.090\nimplementation of the SIAM ecosystem.\n\n300\n00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.350\nSo what we're thinking about\nhere is what we want to achieve.\n\n301\n00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:32.950\nBut as soon as we start, the plan and\nthe build, once we have the go ahead,\n\n302\n00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:38.300\nthe approval of the business case and\nthe go ahead to start an implementation,\n\n303\n00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:44.770\nthen as part of setting our plan in\naction, we have to consider the people.\n\n304\n00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:48.240\nIt's not just about trying to\nconfigure the processes and\n\n305\n00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.770\ntrying to configure our practices.\n\n306\n00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:55.780\nIt's also about trying to ensure that\nwe encompass all of the people and\n\n307\n00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.500\nthat we get everyone on board.\n\n308\n00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.840\nSo when did we start\norganizational change management?\n\n309\n00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.650\nWell, we start that during the plan and\nbuild phase.\n\n310\n00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.590\nIf we do it during the implementation\nphase, it's too late.\n\n311\n00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.250\nAnd take a look back at the episodes\nwhere we discussed OCM and\n\n312\n00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.810\norganizational change management.\n\n313\n00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.440\nIt's too late at that point in time.\n\n314\n00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:22.780\nBecause during implementation, what\nyou're doing is you're bringing people\n\n315\n00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.460\nto a SIAM ecosystem.\n\n316\n00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.330\nYou're bringing them with you.\n\n317\n00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.580\nYou're asking them to be involved.\n\n318\n00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.380\nWell, we've already gotta convince\nthem that this is a good idea.\n\n319\n00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.460\nThey've got to be on board before\nthey can start doing the work.\n\n320\n00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.290\nBecause if you don't consider\norganizational change management,\n\n321\n00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.900\nthen you're going to have resistance.\n\n322\n00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:49.230\nAnd where you have resistance,\nthen you're not going to get a, well,\n\n323\n00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.610\nan efficient and effective implementation.\n\n324\n00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.420\nYou're not gonna get people on board.\n\n325\n00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.610\nAnd if you're not gonna get people on\nboard where you've got resistance,\n\n326\n00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:03.000\nthen you could have people that are going\nto undermine the implementation.\n\n327\n00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.270\nAnd it won't run as smoothly\nas you expect it to.\n\n328\n00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:09.820\nAnd it certainly won't run in\nthe long-term on an on-going basis,\n\n329\n00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.070\nas smooth as you expect to either.\n\n330\n00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.780\nSo during implementation and\nrun and improve, that's too late.\n\n331\n00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.400\nIt's got to be considered\nduring the planning.\n\n332\n00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.200\nSo, what about incident management then?\n\n333\n00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.660\nIncident management,\nwe know that incident management\n\n334\n00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.200\nis about restoring normal service\noperation as quickly as possible.\n\n335\n00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.640\nAnd we have an episode on\nthe incident management process.\n\n336\n00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.400\nSo which of these is a consideration for\nincident management?\n\n337\n00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.670\nOkay, defining rules for\nmanaging event thresholds.\n\n338\n00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.930\nWell, that's part of event management.\n\n339\n00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:47.450\nOkay, well,\nwhat thresholds does each event have?\n\n340\n00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:52.380\nConsider, I think the example we used in\nthat particular episode was the example of\n\n341\n00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:53.420\nthe thermostat.\n\n342\n00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:54.500\nWe set a threshold, and\n\n343\n00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:58.120\nI'm sure we set it to 20 degrees cause\nyou know I always work in celsius right?\n\n344\n00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:00.840\nSo that's event management.\n\n345\n00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.820\nAnd what about B, ensuring all service\nproviders are able to monitor their\n\n346\n00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.310\nservices and\nunderlying technical components.\n\n347\n00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.220\nAgain well that's down to even management.\n\n348\n00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:15.080\nEnsuring that all service providers\nare able to monitor their services\n\n349\n00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.190\nI expect all service providers\nto monitor their services.\n\n350\n00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.210\nYou know,\nthat is part event management, but\n\n351\n00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:24.070\nit's also part of the end-to-end\nservice management as well.\n\n352\n00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:28.520\nAs so we need to ensure\nthat all service providers\n\n353\n00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.270\nwill have an oversight\nover their own services.\n\n354\n00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.230\nBecause they're delivering those\nservices to our customers.\n\n355\n00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.350\nSo that's incident management too.\n\n356\n00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.920\nSo number C then, or\nletter C, managing events.\n\n357\n00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.160\nIs this about managing again?\n\n358\n00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.390\nManaging events that are degrading or\ncould degrade service performance.\n\n359\n00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:52.930\nRight okay, what's the SIAM\nconsideration for incident management?\n\n360\n00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:55.980\nThe bit about degrading or\n\n361\n00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:59.530\ncould degrade service performance\nis incident management.\n\n362\n00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:04.060\nBecause an incident is any\nevent that either disrupts or\n\n363\n00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.210\ncould disrupt a service.\n\n364\n00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:10.050\nAnd an incident is an interruption,\ntoo, or\n\n365\n00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:14.300\na reduction,\na degradation in the quality of a service.\n\n366\n00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.530\nHowever, the first part on\nthis one says managing events.\n\n367\n00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:19.780\nSo, right now, I'm gonna put\na question mark next to that one,\n\n368\n00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.180\nbecause I'm really not convinced.\n\n369\n00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.160\nSo, let's look at D.\n\n370\n00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.350\nConsideration for\nincident management process D\n\n371\n00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:31.310\nsays minimizing the number of parties\ninvolved in restoring a service.\n\n372\n00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.870\nRight.\n\n373\n00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:37.550\nMinimizing the number of parties involved,\nwhat that means,\n\n374\n00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:42.350\nis that means increasing the efficiency.\n\n375\n00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.820\nSounds good to me.\n\n376\n00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:50.967\nBecause every single process has got to\nbe defined, it's got to be configured for\n\n377\n00:23:50.967 --> 00:23:54.260\nmaximum efficiency, and\nmaximum effectiveness.\n\n378\n00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.408\nRemember We're looking for efficiency and\n\n379\n00:23:57.408 --> 00:24:01.073\neffectiveness in our\nprocesses in our ecosystem.\n\n380\n00:24:01.073 --> 00:24:05.799\nSo therefore, D, not only talks\nabout restoring service, but\n\n381\n00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:08.784\nit also talks about efficiency as well.\n\n382\n00:24:08.784 --> 00:24:11.992\nSo yes, D is definitely the right answer.\n\n383\n00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:14.490\nAnd C, we had a question mark against it.\n\n384\n00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:20.320\nBut it still says managing events and\nmanaging events, that's event management.\n\n385\n00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:25.261\nSo let's take a look at\nquestion number eight.\n\n386\n00:24:25.261 --> 00:24:27.623\nDefining the level of control and\n\n387\n00:24:27.623 --> 00:24:32.442\nownership to be retained by\na customer organization is important.\n\n388\n00:24:32.442 --> 00:24:34.772\nYes, it is.\n\n389\n00:24:34.772 --> 00:24:36.821\nSo what's a risk of\nleaving this undecided?\n\n390\n00:24:36.821 --> 00:24:41.506\nIn other words,\nwhat will happen if we don't define\n\n391\n00:24:41.506 --> 00:24:44.810\nthe level of control and ownership.\n\n392\n00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:53.100\nA, it will be challenging to assign\nresponsibility for service failures.\n\n393\n00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.841\nNot necessarily, not necessarily.\n\n394\n00:24:55.841 --> 00:24:56.752\nYou should still.\n\n395\n00:24:56.752 --> 00:25:01.152\nIf the incident management\nprocess is efficient,\n\n396\n00:25:01.152 --> 00:25:06.893\nwe should still be able to assign\nresponsibilities for failures.\n\n397\n00:25:06.893 --> 00:25:11.251\nBut we will not be able to\nassign responsibilities for say,\n\n398\n00:25:11.251 --> 00:25:13.005\nupgrades and changes.\n\n399\n00:25:13.005 --> 00:25:16.813\nBut for failures, I mean,\nwe may have some arguments.\n\n400\n00:25:16.813 --> 00:25:20.242\nHowever, it's not going to be that bad.\n\n401\n00:25:20.242 --> 00:25:23.482\nBecause we should have\nour responsibilities.\n\n402\n00:25:23.482 --> 00:25:27.920\nWhat we should have them outlined\nin incident management itself.\n\n403\n00:25:29.745 --> 00:25:35.280\nWhat about B then, service providers\nmay be unable to collaborate.\n\n404\n00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:41.030\nCollaboration not got anything to\ndo with control and ownership.\n\n405\n00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:45.860\nCertainly not the control and ownership\nretained by the customer organization.\n\n406\n00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:52.091\nService providers can still collaborate\nwithout the ownership being\n\n407\n00:25:52.091 --> 00:25:56.011\nretained by the customer,\nthey will still collaborate.\n\n408\n00:25:56.011 --> 00:25:57.232\nC is the right answer.\n\n409\n00:25:57.232 --> 00:26:00.733\nIt says that the service integrator\nmay not be able to perform its role.\n\n410\n00:26:00.733 --> 00:26:05.348\nWell, sure, if we don't know what level of\ncontrol the custom organization is going\n\n411\n00:26:05.348 --> 00:26:09.259\nto retain and what level is going to\nbe passed to the service integrator,\n\n412\n00:26:09.259 --> 00:26:11.140\nthen that's gonna be difficult.\n\n413\n00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:18.300\nBut let's just look at D, the success\nof the SIAM program cannot be measured.\n\n414\n00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.193\nWell, it can.\n\n415\n00:26:21.193 --> 00:26:27.751\nIt can be measured, you can still\nmeasure efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n416\n00:26:27.751 --> 00:26:33.566\nNow if that question had said,\nthe success might not be as great or\n\n417\n00:26:33.566 --> 00:26:38.428\nwe may not be as efficient or\nwe may not be as effective in\n\n418\n00:26:38.428 --> 00:26:42.902\nmanaging our services,\nI would agree with that.\n\n419\n00:26:42.902 --> 00:26:44.310\nThat's a risk.\n\n420\n00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:49.380\nHowever, what it actually says is that\nthe success cannot be measured and\n\n421\n00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.701\nthat's not true.\n\n422\n00:26:50.701 --> 00:26:55.641\nWe could still measure even though roles\nand responsibilities or control has\n\n423\n00:26:55.641 --> 00:27:00.430\nnot been agreed between the customer,\nand the service integrator layer.\n\n424\n00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:04.144\nYou could still measure everything\nthat happens down here, but\n\n425\n00:27:04.144 --> 00:27:08.694\nit's the control that exists between\nthese top two layers that's the issue.\n\n426\n00:27:08.694 --> 00:27:10.450\nSo the answer to this one is C.\n\n427\n00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:15.503\nThis is one of those questions,\nit's a tricky question.\n\n428\n00:27:15.503 --> 00:27:17.414\nYou might consider this\nto be a hard question.\n\n429\n00:27:17.414 --> 00:27:21.480\nThis is one of those where you're\ngoing to have to read it very,\n\n430\n00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.104\nvery carefully and\nI do have some advice on this as well.\n\n431\n00:27:25.104 --> 00:27:29.792\nIf you get a question where\nyou're not sure, move on.\n\n432\n00:27:29.792 --> 00:27:33.462\nMove on to the next question and\nthen come back to it.\n\n433\n00:27:33.462 --> 00:27:36.542\nBecause by the time you\nfinished all 40 questions,\n\n434\n00:27:36.542 --> 00:27:40.991\nyou're gonna be completely in exam mode\nand them maybe a question a little bit\n\n435\n00:27:40.991 --> 00:27:45.042\nlater on in your paper that may prompt\nyou with the answer for this one.\n\n436\n00:27:45.042 --> 00:27:49.459\nSo if you get to a question where\nyou're not completely 100% certain,\n\n437\n00:27:49.459 --> 00:27:51.360\nmove on and then come back to it.\n\n438\n00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:55.854\nSo question number nine then,\n\n439\n00:27:55.854 --> 00:28:00.406\nwhen integrating processes\nacross service providers,\n\n440\n00:28:00.406 --> 00:28:05.821\nwhat should be used to identify and\navoid gaps in the process flows?\n\n441\n00:28:05.821 --> 00:28:07.671\nThe answer here is a RACI matrix.\n\n442\n00:28:07.671 --> 00:28:12.642\nIf you remember, we discussed RACI\nmatrices in a couple of episodes.\n\n443\n00:28:12.642 --> 00:28:16.152\nAnd if you remember,\nJustin had never heard of them before.\n\n444\n00:28:16.152 --> 00:28:20.658\nSome people, hey, RACI stands for\nResponsible, Accountable,\n\n445\n00:28:20.658 --> 00:28:22.432\nConsulted and Informed.\n\n446\n00:28:22.432 --> 00:28:25.121\nAnd with the RACI matrix, we will, well,\n\n447\n00:28:25.121 --> 00:28:28.112\nsimply write our stakeholders\nalong the top and\n\n448\n00:28:28.112 --> 00:28:32.994\nthen we will write the activities for\nour process down that left-hand side.\n\n449\n00:28:32.994 --> 00:28:38.054\nAnd then in the gaps,\nthen we add in an R and an A and a C and\n\n450\n00:28:38.054 --> 00:28:45.542\nan I, depending on the responsibilities\nof each stakeholder in each activity.\n\n451\n00:28:45.542 --> 00:28:47.551\nSo yes, it's a RACI matrix.\n\n452\n00:28:47.551 --> 00:28:51.459\nThat will help you to\nidentify who should do what,\n\n453\n00:28:51.459 --> 00:28:55.942\nwho should take accountability for\nwhat in the process.\n\n454\n00:28:55.942 --> 00:28:57.792\nDevOps isn't gonna help you with that.\n\n455\n00:28:57.792 --> 00:29:01.730\nDevOps is the synergy between,\nit's a way of life.\n\n456\n00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:06.347\nIt's the synergy between our development\nguys in our operations guys, but\n\n457\n00:29:06.347 --> 00:29:09.751\ncertainly not gonna help you\nwith process management.\n\n458\n00:29:09.751 --> 00:29:12.312\nWhere that KPI,\nour Key Performance Indicator.\n\n459\n00:29:12.312 --> 00:29:14.988\nThat's gonna tell us how we're doing, but\n\n460\n00:29:14.988 --> 00:29:18.541\nit's not gonna help us identify\ngaps in my process flows.\n\n461\n00:29:18.541 --> 00:29:21.665\nSo it's gonna tell us that our\nprocesses aren't necessarily working,\n\n462\n00:29:21.665 --> 00:29:23.930\nbut it's not gonna tell us where.\n\n463\n00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:27.492\nOn an SLA, a Service Level Agreement.\n\n464\n00:29:27.492 --> 00:29:30.898\nWell, that's an agreement\nbetween the customer and\n\n465\n00:29:30.898 --> 00:29:34.462\nthe IT service providers or\nthe IT service integrator.\n\n466\n00:29:34.462 --> 00:29:40.352\nSo again, that's not going to identify\ngaps in our service performance.\n\n467\n00:29:40.352 --> 00:29:44.587\nAll it's going to do or it's not going to\nidentify gaps in our process performance,\n\n468\n00:29:44.587 --> 00:29:47.943\nrather what it's going to do is\ntell us what's not doing too well.\n\n469\n00:29:47.943 --> 00:29:52.022\nBut it's not gonna tell us exactly where.\n\n470\n00:29:52.022 --> 00:29:56.477\nSo then that brings me on\nto question number ten,\n\n471\n00:29:56.477 --> 00:30:00.064\nwhich SIAM consideration is common for\n\n472\n00:30:00.064 --> 00:30:05.184\nall processes in a SIAM ecosystem,\nfor all processes?\n\n473\n00:30:05.184 --> 00:30:07.523\nWell, it tells us quite simply\nthat this is the right answer.\n\n474\n00:30:07.523 --> 00:30:12.853\nBecause defining ownership in the levels\nof accountability has to be done for\n\n475\n00:30:12.853 --> 00:30:18.350\nevery single process, but let's take\na look at the other answers just in case.\n\n476\n00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:24.731\nBuilding and maintaining strong\nrelationships between service providers,\n\n477\n00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:26.886\nand the consumers of their services.\n\n478\n00:30:29.163 --> 00:30:34.463\nSo what we're saying is that this layer\nhere, that's the customer, the consumer.\n\n479\n00:30:34.463 --> 00:30:39.653\nThen we've got our service integrator and\nthen we've got our service providers.\n\n480\n00:30:39.653 --> 00:30:43.774\nSo you're telling me that\nthis layer should have direct\n\n481\n00:30:43.774 --> 00:30:47.114\nrelationship between what with this layer?\n\n482\n00:30:47.114 --> 00:30:49.232\nNo, of course, not.\n\n483\n00:30:49.232 --> 00:30:51.104\nThat's why we have the service integrator.\n\n484\n00:30:51.104 --> 00:30:54.049\nThe relationship goes through\nthe service integrator and\n\n485\n00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:57.243\nthe service integrator has\na relationship with the customer.\n\n486\n00:30:57.243 --> 00:30:58.320\nSo A is wrong.\n\n487\n00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:03.620\nC talks about a consistent method of\nquantifying, tracking and managing.\n\n488\n00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:07.761\nWe already know that is down for\nimprovement and we know that.\n\n489\n00:31:07.761 --> 00:31:12.081\nWe mentioned this earlier on in\na previous question, that was CSI and\n\n490\n00:31:12.081 --> 00:31:17.146\nthen provided a structured approach that\ndelivers projects on time to budget and\n\n491\n00:31:17.146 --> 00:31:19.544\nat the appropriate level of quality.\n\n492\n00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:22.071\nThat's project management.\n\n493\n00:31:22.071 --> 00:31:23.553\nWe're not dealing with project management.\n\n494\n00:31:23.553 --> 00:31:27.583\nWe're dealing service management\nin our SIAM ecosystem.\n\n495\n00:31:27.583 --> 00:31:30.064\nThis is Service Integration and\nManagement.\n\n496\n00:31:30.064 --> 00:31:32.182\nThis is not project management.\n\n497\n00:31:32.182 --> 00:31:37.762\nSo the answer to this one is B,\ndefining process ownership.\n\n498\n00:31:37.762 --> 00:31:40.890\nSo every single process.\n\n499\n00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:41.390\nIt was B.\n\n500\n00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:50.162\nSo now we have completed then part one\nof examination review, how did you do?\n\n501\n00:31:50.162 --> 00:31:54.536\nWell, when you come back for\npart two in our next episode,\n\n502\n00:31:54.536 --> 00:31:59.555\nwe'll be going through questions\n11 through to question 20.\n\n503\n00:31:59.555 --> 00:32:03.885\nSo for now, I'm gonna sign off and\nI'm gonna say, we'll see you in part two.\n\n504\n00:32:03.885 --> 00:32:08.229\nBut I'm Jo Peacock with ITProTV.\n\n505\n00:32:08.229 --> 00:32:11.912\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:14.640\nThis is our second part of\nour examination review.\n\n4\n00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.420\nI'm Joy Peacock and\nI'm gonna be taking you through questions\n\n5\n00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.470\n11 through to questions 20 of your\nSIAM Foundations sample test.\n\n6\n00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.400\nIn episode one, we looked at questions\none through to questions ten.\n\n7\n00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.630\nAnd so now, we're just gonna jump straight\nin and we're gonna take a look at question\n\n8\n00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.820\n11 and we're gonna go through to\nquestion 20, and we'll see how you did.\n\n9\n00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.640\nOkay, so question 11 then, in the Run and\nImprove stage of the SIAM roadmap,\n\n10\n00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.250\nwhich activity provides an environment for\ncollaborative working?\n\n11\n00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.230\nWell, the answer is,\nour management structures.\n\n12\n00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.290\nOperation of our management structures,\n\n13\n00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.320\nthat's the day to day\nmanagement structure.\n\n14\n00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.940\nLet's take a look at why\nit's not any of the others.\n\n15\n00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.350\nManaging performance and improvement,\n\n16\n00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.220\nmanaging performance is not going to\nnecessarily foster collaboration.\n\n17\n00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.770\nAnd in fact, it could have a detrimental\neffect on collaboration too,\n\n18\n00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.660\nespecially if we're managing performance\nand we see some issues that exist maybe\n\n19\n00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.830\nbetween relationships,\nbetween our service providers.\n\n20\n00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.010\nThat if we don't manage that in\na sympathetic way and in a way that\n\n21\n00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.720\nis impartial, then it could actually have\na detrimental effect on collaborations.\n\n22\n00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.932\nSo we've got to be very careful and\nwe know, when we discussed this in our\n\n23\n00:01:31.932 --> 00:01:35.664\nepisodes, when we looked at\nthe collaborative environment and\n\n24\n00:01:35.664 --> 00:01:40.243\nthe environment and the complexity of\nmanaging all of our service providers.\n\n25\n00:01:40.243 --> 00:01:44.256\nThat it's really important that we\nmaintain those relationships and\n\n26\n00:01:44.256 --> 00:01:46.310\nthat they are good relationships.\n\n27\n00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.090\nThen we have monitoring our audit and\ncompliance.\n\n28\n00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.200\nWell, audit and compliance,\nwhat I said in the previous answer,\n\n29\n00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.060\nin answer A, that we didn't want\nto use a baseball bat approach and\n\n30\n00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.240\nwe didn't want to be too regimented, well\nthis is exactly what we don't want to do.\n\n31\n00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.800\nAudit and compliance are going to measure\nwhether our service providers are actually\n\n32\n00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.600\ndoing something.\n\n33\n00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.520\nAnd compliance is just, it has a word\n\n34\n00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.040\nthat has a negative connotation when\nit comes to dealing with collaboration.\n\n35\n00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.010\nWe want to foster an environment of\ncollaboration amongst our service\n\n36\n00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.560\nproviders.\n\n37\n00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.440\nIf they feel as though they're going to\nbe penalized for lack of collaboration,\n\n38\n00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.400\nthen that makes them even more determined,\nshould we say,\n\n39\n00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.600\nto stick to the terms and\nconditions of the contract.\n\n40\n00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.880\nSo, we wanna foster collaboration.\n\n41\n00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.120\nWe certainly don't want to be going in\nthere with a baseball bat approach.\n\n42\n00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.300\nOperation of our governance boards?\n\n43\n00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.340\nWell, we know that governance\nsits at a strategic level.\n\n44\n00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.860\nIt sits at a very high level and,\n\n45\n00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.790\ntherefore, they're gonna be looking\nat this from a strategic perspective.\n\n46\n00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.860\nGovernance boards are going to be asking\nus, they're going to be requesting,\n\n47\n00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.790\nthey're gonna be advising, they're\ngoing to be devising strategies for\n\n48\n00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.590\nus to manage our service\nproviders in a collaborative way.\n\n49\n00:03:07.825 --> 00:03:11.345\nBut the question says, and\nthis is where you've got to be careful,\n\n50\n00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:15.085\nremember my acronym RTFQ,\nread the full question.\n\n51\n00:03:15.085 --> 00:03:20.121\nThe question says,\nwhich activity provides an environment?\n\n52\n00:03:20.121 --> 00:03:24.153\nThis doesn't say,\nwhich activity then encourages, or\n\n53\n00:03:24.153 --> 00:03:30.130\ninsures that we encourage collaborative\nworking, that would be governance.\n\n54\n00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.100\nThis is providing an environment.\n\n55\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.180\nThis is more about at the core phase.\n\n56\n00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.320\nThis is management of that environment.\n\n57\n00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.450\nAnd so our management structures,\nwill demonstrate collaborative working.\n\n58\n00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.680\nAnd our management will also ensure that\nwe are working in a collaborative way\n\n59\n00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.390\nacross our service providers.\n\n60\n00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.570\nSo, the answer to this one is,\nD, cuz this is about operating,\n\n61\n00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.440\nthis is about running\nthe management structures,\n\n62\n00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.186\nnot about governance at a high level but\nthe management itself.\n\n63\n00:04:01.186 --> 00:04:06.120\nSo question 12, which of these,\n\n64\n00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.885\nbe careful of these questions, and, again,\nI use the acronym, read the full question,\n\n65\n00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:17.140\nokay, which of these is not a challenge\nrelated to technology practice for\n\n66\n00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.800\ncreating a tooling strategy?\n\n67\n00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.340\nWhich of these is not a challenge?\n\n68\n00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.000\nIneffective legacy tools, we looked at\nthis when we looked at an episode where we\n\n69\n00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.650\nlooked at technology practices and we know\nthat legacy tools are a challenge to us.\n\n70\n00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.180\nFor implementing a tooling strategy for\nour\n\n71\n00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.000\nservice management itself, we know that\nlegacy tools are a huge, big challenge.\n\n72\n00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.330\nLegacy tools are something\nthat we have to accommodate.\n\n73\n00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.420\nAnd some service providers\nhave legacy tools and\n\n74\n00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.613\nwe may have to accommodate those.\n\n75\n00:04:51.613 --> 00:04:56.505\nThat involves generally some translation,\nsome data sharing, and\n\n76\n00:04:56.505 --> 00:05:01.030\nthat in itself can bring many,\nmany challenges.\n\n77\n00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.117\nGaps between process activities or\nbe careful,\n\n78\n00:05:05.117 --> 00:05:08.314\nthe process should be defined first.\n\n79\n00:05:08.314 --> 00:05:12.740\nWe configure the process,\nand then, we go and\n\n80\n00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.630\nsource a tool that will\nfacilitate the processes.\n\n81\n00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.930\nSo the reason why gaps between\nprocess activities aren't a challenge,\n\n82\n00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.180\nis because we defined the process first.\n\n83\n00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.277\nThe tool simply does\nwhat you tell it to do.\n\n84\n00:05:28.277 --> 00:05:31.310\nThe tool is not a process.\n\n85\n00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.040\nThis is quite a common misconception,\nby the way.\n\n86\n00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.512\nIncident management is that tool,\nno it's not,\n\n87\n00:05:37.512 --> 00:05:41.590\nincident management\nare the steps that you perform.\n\n88\n00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.210\nIncident management is the process.\n\n89\n00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.890\nThe tool is what it facilitates\nincident management.\n\n90\n00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.640\nSo, gaps between process activities\nis not a challenge of a tool set.\n\n91\n00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.488\nIt's a challenge for a process owner,\nbut it's not a challenge for tool set\n\n92\n00:05:57.488 --> 00:06:02.280\nbecause a tool set simply facilitates\nwhatever process it's been given.\n\n93\n00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.409\nDefining the scope of the tool set, yes,\nthat is a challenge, because we need\n\n94\n00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:12.539\nto know exactly who is going to be using\nthat tool set, in terms of which service\n\n95\n00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:17.720\nproviders, and also which processes\nare going to be using that tool set.\n\n96\n00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.090\nSo which processes do we have to configure\n\n97\n00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.057\nin order to use the tool set\nto facilitate those processes?\n\n98\n00:06:27.057 --> 00:06:31.968\nA non-compliant service providers\ndefinitely, definitely a challenge here\n\n99\n00:06:31.968 --> 00:06:36.010\nbecause, of course,\nwe've got multiple services providers.\n\n100\n00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.288\nWhat if one of our service providers\ndecided not to use out tool set or\n\n101\n00:06:40.288 --> 00:06:43.988\nmaybe they don't want to use our tool set.\n\n102\n00:06:43.988 --> 00:06:47.706\nBut then we've got all of our other\nservice providers using that tool set and\n\n103\n00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:51.890\nthere's some consistency there, but then\nthere's not a huge amount of consistency\n\n104\n00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.577\nbecause we've got one or two service\nproviders that don't want to use it.\n\n105\n00:06:55.577 --> 00:06:58.403\nThis is a challenge for\nthe service integrator, so\n\n106\n00:06:58.403 --> 00:07:03.460\nthis is definitely a challenge when\nwe're creating a strategy for tooling.\n\n107\n00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.120\nBecause we have to ensure consistency\nacross all of our service providers.\n\n108\n00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.260\nWatch out for the word,\nnot in this question.\n\n109\n00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:17.150\nIf you miss this word,\nyou will be looking for the wrong answer.\n\n110\n00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.710\nSo easily done, and it's something that\nI tell everybody at foundation level,\n\n111\n00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.480\nwith every test, and\nI know that I use my acronym.\n\n112\n00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.430\nAnd some people have a bit of a giggle\nabout that and I don't know why.\n\n113\n00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.140\nRTFQ though, read the full question.\n\n114\n00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.190\nEvery single word that's in that\nquestion is really important.\n\n115\n00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.100\nAnd if you miss words like not and\n\n116\n00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.700\nshould and most, you'll be heading for\nthe wrong answer.\n\n117\n00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.300\nSo be very careful of that, very careful.\n\n118\n00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.330\nLet's take a look at Question 13 then.\n\n119\n00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.869\nSo, in a hybrid service\nintegrator structure, so\n\n120\n00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:55.000\nwe know a hybrid is a mixture\nof that internal and external.\n\n121\n00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.430\nWhich two parties collaborate to provide\nthe service integrated capability?\n\n122\n00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.880\nWell, I've just given you\nthe answer to that, haven't I?\n\n123\n00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.010\nIt's internal to the customer\nenvironment and external.\n\n124\n00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.000\nSo which two?\n\n125\n00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.120\nWell, its got to be a, hasn't it, yeah?\n\n126\n00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.380\nI've given you the answer to that.\n\n127\n00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.656\nIt's not gonna be the customer and\ninternal service integrator,\n\n128\n00:08:17.656 --> 00:08:23.340\nbecause internal means internal to the\ncustomer, so that doesn't make any sense.\n\n129\n00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.700\nAnd we've got no mention\nof any external in there.\n\n130\n00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.540\nAn external and a lead supplier,\n\n131\n00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.620\nwell a lead supplier is another\ntype of service integrator.\n\n132\n00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.890\nAnd that's also external, so we're\ntalking external, and external again,\n\n133\n00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.250\nthat doesn't make any sense.\n\n134\n00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.080\nInternal service integrator,\ninternal to the organization and\n\n135\n00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.090\nretained capabilities.\n\n136\n00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.560\nRetained capabilities are also\ninternal to the customer.\n\n137\n00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:55.890\nSo that's the customer's governance,\nthat's the customer's strategy.\n\n138\n00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.820\nSo, that doesn't make any sense either,\n\n139\n00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.071\nbecause again,\nwe're talking internal and internal.\n\n140\n00:09:01.071 --> 00:09:04.750\nThe only one that mentions internal and\nexternal is A,\n\n141\n00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.370\nand that's your hybrid structure,\na mixture of the both.\n\n142\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:16.210\nSo which of these, then, is a challenge\nwhen facing cross-functional teams?\n\n143\n00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.540\nLet's take a look at 14 then.\n\n144\n00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.490\nWhich of these is the main challenge\nassociated with cross-functional teams?\n\n145\n00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:28.590\nThere I go again, yeah, reading the full\nquestion, picking out these words.\n\n146\n00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.460\nThey're really important.\n\n147\n00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.430\nIt's not asking which is a challenge,\n\n148\n00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.420\ncuz potentially in these answers\nall of them could be a challenge.\n\n149\n00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.395\nIt's asking which one of these is\nthe main challenge associated with\n\n150\n00:09:40.395 --> 00:09:41.490\ncross-functional teams.\n\n151\n00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.500\nAnd of course the answer there is A,\nconflicting objectives, and\n\n152\n00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.330\norganizational strategies and\nworking practices.\n\n153\n00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.480\nThat's the main challenge.\n\n154\n00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.200\nWhat about B,\ngaps between process activities?\n\n155\n00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.120\nIt's that a main challenge?\n\n156\n00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.980\nIt's a challenge, but\nit's not necessarily a main challenge.\n\n157\n00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.710\nInability to map end to end workflows.\n\n158\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:08.680\nWell, an inability is not a challenge,\nthat simply means that you're unable to.\n\n159\n00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.840\nSo that's not necessarily a challenge,\nthat's more like an ability and\n\n160\n00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.270\nthe fact that you don't have that ability.\n\n161\n00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.810\nYou should be able to map\nthe end to end workflow.\n\n162\n00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.640\nIf you can't, then simply,\n\n163\n00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.138\nyou won't really have\na cross-functional team necessarily.\n\n164\n00:10:26.138 --> 00:10:31.490\nSo it's a challenge, but it's a side\nchallenge and it's not the main challenge.\n\n165\n00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:36.330\nThe lack of architecture, again,\nvery similar to that inability.\n\n166\n00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.470\nA lack of architecture means\nthat you can't do anything.\n\n167\n00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.230\nSo that's another challenge to\nmanaging cross functional teams,\n\n168\n00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.840\nthat's just a challenge in itself,\nthat is a huge challenge.\n\n169\n00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:53.618\nBut the main challenge here associated\nwith managing cross functional teams is A,\n\n170\n00:10:53.618 --> 00:10:55.370\nit's conflicting objectives.\n\n171\n00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.700\nIt's having organizational strategies\nthat again maybe conflict, and\n\n172\n00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.670\nworking practices that conflict.\n\n173\n00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:05.700\nBecause every single service\nprovider organization\n\n174\n00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.900\nwill work in a completely different way,\nand\n\n175\n00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:13.130\nI know that I've said this multiple\ntimes throughout our episodes.\n\n176\n00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:17.310\nEvery single service provider\norganization works differently,\n\n177\n00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.040\nevery organization works differently.\n\n178\n00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.760\nEven though they are in\nthe same industry sector,\n\n179\n00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.270\nthey still nevertheless\nwill work differently.\n\n180\n00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:31.550\nAnd therefore ensuring\nthat the priorities and\n\n181\n00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.430\nthe objectives and the strategies don't\nobject is always going to be a challenge,\n\n182\n00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.950\nand it's one that the service\nintegrator has to overcome.\n\n183\n00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.390\nSo question number 15.\n\n184\n00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:46.040\nWhich operational role is responsible for\n\n185\n00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.540\ndiscussing lessons learned\narising from a major incident?\n\n186\n00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:56.460\nAnd that is the incident management forum.\n\n187\n00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:03.140\nLessons learned from a major incident,\na working group\n\n188\n00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:09.200\nis convened to discuss something\nthat we're working on right now.\n\n189\n00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.267\nIt's an issue that we have right now.\n\n190\n00:12:12.267 --> 00:12:13.972\nThe forum will discuss,\n\n191\n00:12:13.972 --> 00:12:18.764\na process forum will discuss what's\ngone wrong with the process, and\n\n192\n00:12:18.764 --> 00:12:23.798\nwhat has gone right with the process\nthat we can apply to another process or\n\n193\n00:12:23.798 --> 00:12:28.530\nto another part of that process, so\nthat we can improve the process.\n\n194\n00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:34.900\nSo the forum will look back\nas to what's happened, and\n\n195\n00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.640\nlooking at the question, and\nagain, read the full question.\n\n196\n00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.200\nWhich role is responsible for\ndiscussing lessons learned?\n\n197\n00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:49.620\nThis is not about finding out what's gone\non and working out how to fix something.\n\n198\n00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:54.740\nThat would be a working group and\nthat would be an active major incident.\n\n199\n00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.770\nBut we're not talking about\nan active major incident.\n\n200\n00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:02.300\nIn this question,\nwe're talking about lessons learned.\n\n201\n00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.330\nAnd a lessons learned exercise,\ncalled a major incident review,\n\n202\n00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:11.550\nand we conduct a major incident review\nafter the incident has been resolved.\n\n203\n00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.180\nSo we do that in the process forum,\nwhich is A.\n\n204\n00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.650\nOf course, the change advisory board,\nwell, the change advisory board evaluates\n\n205\n00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:26.090\nand assesses change, and integrated means\nintegrated across our service providers.\n\n206\n00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:31.440\nSo no, that will not discuss lessons\nlearnt from a major incident.\n\n207\n00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.130\nAnd, again,\nthe major incident working group, well,\n\n208\n00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:36.580\nit's the same as an incident\nmanagement working group.\n\n209\n00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.300\nIt's a working group for\nthe incident management process.\n\n210\n00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.510\nThis one focuses specifically\non the major incident.\n\n211\n00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:47.570\nAgain, they are fixing the incident at\nthat time, they are restoring service.\n\n212\n00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:53.010\nWe call a working group as an ad hoc\nactivity to undertake a certain task.\n\n213\n00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:57.460\nThe process forum, however,\nlooks at the lessons learned and says,\n\n214\n00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.330\nwhat can we learn from this and\nwhat can we apply to the future?\n\n215\n00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.450\nSo the answer is A.\n\n216\n00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:09.320\nBe very careful, be aware of\nthe difference between a working group and\n\n217\n00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.160\na forum.\n\n218\n00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.280\nA forum looks at a process, and\n\n219\n00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.560\nlooks at how we can improve a process,\nand how we can build a process.\n\n220\n00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.660\nBut a working group is called.\n\n221\n00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:24.420\nIt's an ad hoc group, and\nit's called to discuss a specific\n\n222\n00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.100\nissue, something that's\nhappening right now.\n\n223\n00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.780\nNow we did say, in one of our previous\nepisodes we said that a working group and\n\n224\n00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.190\na forum can be combined, and\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n225\n00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:40.950\nBut we have to bear in mind that that\nworking group is something that we call\n\n226\n00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.330\nsort of here and\nnow to discuss something that's important.\n\n227\n00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.620\nSo the process forum is\nsomething that we're discussing.\n\n228\n00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:54.260\nWell, it's a forum where we're discussing\nwhat already happened in the past\n\n229\n00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.040\nand what we want to plan for the future.\n\n230\n00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:03.050\nSo if you want to combine the two, that's\ngreat, but a major incident working group?\n\n231\n00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.525\nThey're going to be working\non a major incident and\n\n232\n00:15:05.525 --> 00:15:09.780\nthey're probably not going to have time to\nsit back and discuss the lessons learned.\n\n233\n00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.630\nLet then fix the issue first, shall we?\n\n234\n00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.450\nTo question number 16 then,\nin which stage of the SIAM roadmap, so\n\n235\n00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:21.670\nthis is our implementation, should\nthe preferred SIAM structure be selected?\n\n236\n00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.550\nWell, it's not gonna be in discovery and\nstrategy.\n\n237\n00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:29.190\nThis is where in discovery and strategy,\nwe're coming up for a justification.\n\n238\n00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.850\nSo, it's not going to be there, but\nit is going to be in the next stage,\n\n239\n00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.380\nand the next stage is the plan and build.\n\n240\n00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.860\nAnd then we implement and\nthen we run and we improve.\n\n241\n00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.832\nSo we select the structure\nas part of our planning.\n\n242\n00:15:41.832 --> 00:15:44.118\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n243\n00:15:44.118 --> 00:15:46.947\nIf we're selecting the structure\nas part of the implementation,\n\n244\n00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:50.232\nthen that suggests that we haven't\nplanned it, and that would be too late.\n\n245\n00:15:50.232 --> 00:15:53.488\nSo what's gonna happen is,\nwe're gonna have chaos, and\n\n246\n00:15:53.488 --> 00:15:55.620\nthat's exactly what we don't want.\n\n247\n00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.850\nSo then let's take a look\nat question number 17 then.\n\n248\n00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:05.490\nWhich layer performs end to\nend insurance or assurance?\n\n249\n00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.360\nSorry, couldn't read there.\n\n250\n00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.420\nWhich layer performs end\nto end service assurance?\n\n251\n00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.590\nWell, it's simple.\n\n252\n00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:14.410\nIf we're measuring the end to end service,\n\n253\n00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:18.640\nthen we're measuring the contribution of\nall of our individual service providers.\n\n254\n00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.690\nAnd the person that's doing that is\ngonna be that service integrator layer,\n\n255\n00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:26.310\nbecause they integrate all of\nthe components of the service.\n\n256\n00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.110\nIt's not gonna be the customer\norganization because that's who we're\n\n257\n00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.640\ndelivering our services to.\n\n258\n00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.880\nAnd the retained capabilities,\nthey're about governance and\n\n259\n00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.140\nthey sit in the customer organization.\n\n260\n00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:43.689\nAnd end to end assurance can't be done\nby the individual service providers\n\n261\n00:16:43.689 --> 00:16:48.900\nbecause they will only have a focus\non their particular involvement.\n\n262\n00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.976\nSo it has to be the service integrator\nbecause they're the only people that see\n\n263\n00:16:52.976 --> 00:16:55.460\nthe big picture from\na technical perspective.\n\n264\n00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.420\nThey're the only people that know and\n\n265\n00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.180\nunderstand the big picture\nfrom a technical perspective.\n\n266\n00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.890\nI don't expect my customer to understand\nanything from a technical perspective.\n\n267\n00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.790\nSo now question 18, question 18,\nwhich consideration is common for\n\n268\n00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:15.510\nall processes in a SIAM eco-system?\n\n269\n00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:19.120\nNow, bearing in mind that\nwe've only got A, B, or C.\n\n270\n00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.430\nWe don't have A, B, C, or D and as I said,\n\n271\n00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:27.040\nin our first episode where\nwe looked at the exams.\n\n272\n00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.880\nAnd we did an introduction\nto examinations within SIAM,\n\n273\n00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.450\nsome questions you may only have A,\nB, or C,\n\n274\n00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:40.830\nthe same principle applies,\nwe still got one right question.\n\n275\n00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.400\nYou don't get a negative mark for\nanswering something wrong,\n\n276\n00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.340\nthere's still only one right question.\n\n277\n00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.682\nIn this instance, it's B.\n\n278\n00:17:46.682 --> 00:17:51.670\nSo which consideration is common for\nall processes in the SIAM eco-system?\n\n279\n00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:56.010\nWell, it's simple, processes are complex\nbecause we've got the complexity of\n\n280\n00:17:56.010 --> 00:18:00.240\nthe relationships between all\nof our service providers.\n\n281\n00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:06.650\nAligning resolution targets across service\nproviders, is that a consideration?\n\n282\n00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:12.780\nWell, it might be if we\nalways want to resolve maybe,\n\n283\n00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.780\nbut there's an assumption there.\n\n284\n00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:19.220\nWe've got to ensure that we've\ngot targets aligned, but\n\n285\n00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.609\nthey're not necessarily\nalways resolution targets.\n\n286\n00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:26.901\nAgain, look at the wording.\n\n287\n00:18:26.901 --> 00:18:28.764\nRead everything.\n\n288\n00:18:28.764 --> 00:18:30.370\nCheck it.\n\n289\n00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.485\nLook at the wording.\n\n290\n00:18:32.485 --> 00:18:37.070\nCuz you're making an assumption in\nA that everything is a resolution.\n\n291\n00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:40.063\nAnd it might not necessarily be.\n\n292\n00:18:40.063 --> 00:18:44.030\nLook at it, read the question,\nwhich is common for\n\n293\n00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:48.160\nall processes, not all processes resolve.\n\n294\n00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.280\nAnd I know that you're sitting\nthere going, yeah, okay,\n\n295\n00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.440\nI get that, but\nthis is why I'm here, right?\n\n296\n00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.470\nTo go through this with you.\n\n297\n00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.810\nWhich of these is common for\nall processes?\n\n298\n00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.970\nAll of the words are important.\n\n299\n00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.880\nThe requirement for\na data dictionary, terminology and\n\n300\n00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:13.270\nthresholds, that's not necessarily\ncommon again for all processes.\n\n301\n00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.090\nWe might have a requirement for\nterminology,\n\n302\n00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:20.800\ndictionary, for\nsome processes but not for all.\n\n303\n00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.690\nIf everybody has been involved in the same\nlevel of training, then there probably\n\n304\n00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:30.200\nwon't be a requirement for specific\ndata dictionary or for terminology.\n\n305\n00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.075\nSo that's an assumption, C.\n\n306\n00:19:33.075 --> 00:19:35.930\nB is not an assumption, B is a statement.\n\n307\n00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.430\nC is an assumption.\n\n308\n00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:41.130\nStay away from assumptions as well\nwhen it comes to this particular test.\n\n309\n00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.290\nOne thing that you don't\nwanna do is assume.\n\n310\n00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.150\nSo now question number 19, then.\n\n311\n00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:47.390\nWhat have we got here?\n\n312\n00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:48.855\nIn a SIAM eco-system,\n\n313\n00:19:48.855 --> 00:19:52.747\nservice providers need to adapt\nto a new way of working, okay.\n\n314\n00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:58.340\nSo which of these is an associated\ncultural consideration?\n\n315\n00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.783\nAnd again, we've only got A, B, or C.\n\n316\n00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:02.637\nBut the answer here is B.\n\n317\n00:20:02.637 --> 00:20:04.400\nWell, let's take a look at them.\n\n318\n00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:09.589\nCreating an environment for service\nproviders that's focused on contracts and\n\n319\n00:20:09.589 --> 00:20:12.882\nagreements, that should\nnever ever be the focus.\n\n320\n00:20:12.882 --> 00:20:20.580\nThe environment should always focus\non value delivery to the customer.\n\n321\n00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.870\nThat's our focus.\n\n322\n00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:28.220\nWe discussed in previous episodes and\nwe discussed in quite a few episodes now.\n\n323\n00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.750\nThe simple fact that if you tie people\ndown, if you tie service providers down\n\n324\n00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:37.380\nto their contracts then that\nactually discourages collaboration.\n\n325\n00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.140\nAnd it means that there's no flexibility.\n\n326\n00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:46.653\nAnd if there's no flexibility, if we\nseverely, strictly impose penalties and\n\n327\n00:20:46.653 --> 00:20:52.909\nincentives without any flexibility, then\nyou're not encouraging that collaboration.\n\n328\n00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:54.657\nYou're probably not gonna deliver value.\n\n329\n00:20:54.657 --> 00:20:58.687\nBecause you're gonna get a lot of\nservice providers going, [SOUND] nope,\n\n330\n00:20:58.687 --> 00:21:02.270\nmy responsibility ends here, and\nthat's as much as I'm doing.\n\n331\n00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.720\nBecause if I do something else,\nthen it might affect somebody else.\n\n332\n00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.500\nSo no, this is my responsibility.\n\n333\n00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.410\nAnd we're gonna get a lot of incidents and\nproblems and\n\n334\n00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:15.350\nchanges that get passed from one\nservice provider to the next.\n\n335\n00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:20.470\nSo focus on contracts and agreements is\ndefinitely not what we should be doing.\n\n336\n00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.250\nService providers\nacknowledging that the service\n\n337\n00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:28.610\nintegrator has the autonomy to direct,\nto make decisions and therefore govern.\n\n338\n00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.040\nThat is a cultural consideration.\n\n339\n00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:37.280\nMaking sure that the service\nintegrator is empowered.\n\n340\n00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.815\nThis was a word I've used\nin previous episodes.\n\n341\n00:21:39.815 --> 00:21:45.220\nThe service integrator is empowered to\nmake decisions on behalf of the customer.\n\n342\n00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.290\nThey're the person, or people,\nthey're the team that are managing\n\n343\n00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:53.260\nall of our service providers\non behalf of the customer.\n\n344\n00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.150\nSo therefore, they have to be\nempowered to make decision.\n\n345\n00:21:56.150 --> 00:22:01.230\nAnd they have to be in that position where\nif something's not quite going right,\n\n346\n00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.910\nif maybe an incident is not being\nresolved as quickly as it should be,\n\n347\n00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:07.690\nthen the service integrator has\nto be able to step in and say,\n\n348\n00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:10.400\nokay, I need you guys to work together.\n\n349\n00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.300\nAnd we've got to solve this,\nwe've got to get back to the customer.\n\n350\n00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:16.020\nSo let's take a look at C then.\n\n351\n00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.840\nService providers are focusing on\nthe achievement of their own specific\n\n352\n00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.670\nservice levels and objectives.\n\n353\n00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:26.570\nAnd again, remember what I said,\nwe got to encourage collaboration.\n\n354\n00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.680\nC is not collaborative at all.\n\n355\n00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.610\nThis is not a cultural\nconsideration because this is\n\n356\n00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:33.470\nexactly what we don't want.\n\n357\n00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:39.600\nWe want to encourage collaboration and\nC doesn't encourage collaboration at all.\n\n358\n00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.520\nSo now let's go and have a look at our\nlast question now for the sample paper\n\n359\n00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:50.240\nwhich is question 20, which is a SIAM\nconsideration of monitoring and measuring.\n\n360\n00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.930\nSo SIAM considerations for monitoring and\n\n361\n00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:58.110\nmeasuring is the requirement for\nconsistent data.\n\n362\n00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:00.080\nThat's data dictionary, data models,\n\n363\n00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.947\nterminology, thresholds,\nreporting schedules, okay.\n\n364\n00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.972\nSo when we're monitoring and measuring,\n\n365\n00:23:06.972 --> 00:23:11.720\nwe have to ensure that we measure\nconsistently the exact same thing.\n\n366\n00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:16.090\nSo therefore there has to be\nconsistency across all of our data.\n\n367\n00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:20.050\nWe're measuring the same thing,\nyou can't compare apples and oranges.\n\n368\n00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.470\nYou have to compare oranges to oranges,\n\n369\n00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:27.420\nwe have to compare the same thing\nacross all of our service providers.\n\n370\n00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:31.920\nSo let's look at A, A talks about\nresponsibilities for testing integration\n\n371\n00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:36.940\nbetween services from different\nservice providers should be defined.\n\n372\n00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:40.850\nTesting integration between services\nfrom different service providers.\n\n373\n00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:42.940\nNot all of our services\nare integrated though.\n\n374\n00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.210\nDifferent service\nproviders will be providing\n\n375\n00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.600\ndifferent components\nof different services.\n\n376\n00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.160\nSo they're not necessarily\nall going to be implemented.\n\n377\n00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.734\nSo again, A It's okay, but\nit's an assumption, and\n\n378\n00:23:56.734 --> 00:24:01.111\nis that testing integration\nbetween the services,\n\n379\n00:24:01.111 --> 00:24:06.290\nis that a consideration for\nwhat we're monitoring?\n\n380\n00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:10.190\nNo, no it's not, so\nA is not the right answer.\n\n381\n00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:19.170\nTargets for event diagnosis and resolution\nshould be coming across service providers.\n\n382\n00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:22.720\nIs that a consideration for\nmonitoring and measuring?\n\n383\n00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.490\nIt could be a consideration for\nmonitoring,\n\n384\n00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:29.600\nbut targets for\nevent diagnosis and resolution.\n\n385\n00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.720\nWe don't diagnose and resolve an event.\n\n386\n00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.929\nWe do an incident.\n\n387\n00:24:34.929 --> 00:24:39.153\nEvent management is about\ndetecting changes of state, and\n\n388\n00:24:39.153 --> 00:24:42.710\nthen alternating it,\ndoing something about it.\n\n389\n00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:47.672\nBut we mention resolution as though\nsomething has gone wrong, and\n\n390\n00:24:47.672 --> 00:24:49.360\nwe need to resolve it.\n\n391\n00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.250\nNot all events need resolving.\n\n392\n00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.630\nSo to say that should be coming\nacross all service providers anyway,\n\n393\n00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:56.960\ndoesn't make any sense.\n\n394\n00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.790\nBecause every single service\nprovider is going to be delivering\n\n395\n00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:03.260\ndifferent components,\ndifferent elements of a service.\n\n396\n00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.870\nAnd therefore, if they're all gonna\nbe delivering different components,\n\n397\n00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:10.610\nthen we're monitoring different things\nacross different service providers.\n\n398\n00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:16.460\nSo how can we ensure consistency across\nall of those different components and\n\n399\n00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.309\nconsistency in resolution?\n\n400\n00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.080\nWell, you can't.\n\n401\n00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.670\nSo there's way too much wrong B, as well.\n\n402\n00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:27.570\nIt's really mixing up\nsome of the processes.\n\n403\n00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.930\nIt's mixing up the terminology, and\n\n404\n00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.310\nit also just really simply\ndoesn't make sense.\n\n405\n00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:34.860\nSo the answer here then is C.\n\n406\n00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.120\nIt's a requirement for consistency in\nour data, and in our standards, and\n\n407\n00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.950\nin our thresholds, and in our terminology.\n\n408\n00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.380\nSo that's your sample paper.\n\n409\n00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:52.130\nAnd your sample paper is well,\nquestions 1 through questions 20, okay?\n\n410\n00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:57.400\nYour sample paper is your\nEXIN sample paper that's\n\n411\n00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:04.470\ncome from the EXIN examining board.\n\n412\n00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.520\nI couldn't quite get my words out there.\n\n413\n00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.380\nSo, what I want you to do now is go and\n\n414\n00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:14.210\nreview any questions that\nyou may have got wrong.\n\n415\n00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:18.670\nAnd see if you can understand why you\ngot those particular questions wrong.\n\n416\n00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:23.220\nGo back to the episodes where we\ncovered those particular questions.\n\n417\n00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:27.220\nOur episodes are very,\nvery clearly labeled.\n\n418\n00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.945\nGo back to those episodes.\n\n419\n00:26:28.945 --> 00:26:32.091\nAnd if there is something that\nyou still don't quite understand,\n\n420\n00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:33.225\nthen please feel free.\n\n421\n00:26:33.225 --> 00:26:37.735\nSend us a chat message in our forum,\nand I'll be happy to reply to you and\n\n422\n00:26:37.735 --> 00:26:41.045\nhelp you with any questions\nthat you may have.\n\n423\n00:26:41.045 --> 00:26:45.015\nBut now's the time for\nyou to go and book your test.\n\n424\n00:26:45.015 --> 00:26:50.770\nNow is the time for you to go and\nsit your SIAM Foundation test.\n\n425\n00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:55.600\nSo, I'm gonna wish you good luck,\nbut you don't need it, right?\n\n426\n00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.250\nBecause you know everything that you\nneed to know now in order to be really\n\n427\n00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.560\nsuccessful in your test.\n\n428\n00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:06.740\nSo, get out there, log on, book your test.\n\n429\n00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.490\nAnd come back and\nlet us know how you got on and\n\n430\n00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:13.360\nwe'll see you in our SIAM practitioner.\n\n431\n00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.832\nBut for now, thanks for\nwatching, I'm Joey Peacock, and\n\n432\n00:27:17.832 --> 00:27:21.148\nthis has been your SIAM Foundation series.\n\n433\n00:27:21.148 --> 00:27:21.648\n[SOUND]\n\n",
