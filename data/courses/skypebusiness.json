OFFICEPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.037 --> 00:00:18.544\nYou're watching the Skype for\nBusiness show.\n\n4\n00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:21.205\nWe've already talked a little bit\nabout some introductory material,\n\n5\n00:00:21.205 --> 00:00:22.456\nas well as getting it installed.\n\n6\n00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:25.997\nBut now, of course, anybody that's\nactually a professional using this,\n\n7\n00:00:25.997 --> 00:00:28.110\nneeds to be able to get\naround the interface.\n\n8\n00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.670\nAs well as understanding\nsome of the sign in methods.\n\n9\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.103\nAnd here to help us, of course, is going\nto be our Office Pro guru herself, Ms.\n\n10\n00:00:34.103 --> 00:00:34.736\nVonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:35.893\nVonne, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:35.893 --> 00:00:38.142\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for\nhaving me, always glad to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:43.194\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, as we get started here,\nit seems almost intuitive.\n\n14\n00:00:43.194 --> 00:00:46.844\nBut there are a few things that can be\ntricky, especially on a sign in process.\n\n15\n00:00:46.844 --> 00:00:52.035\nAnd then we really don't realize how\nbig Skype for Business really can be.\n\n16\n00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:53.673\nSo you're gonna show us around, right?\n\n17\n00:00:53.673 --> 00:00:54.453\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n18\n00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:57.924\nThis is our getting started,\nit's part of our introduction topic.\n\n19\n00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:02.001\nSo yeah, like you said, it does seem\npretty intuitive, you just sign in,\n\n20\n00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:04.813\nbut we're just gonna go\nover a few little nuances.\n\n21\n00:01:04.813 --> 00:01:08.784\nAnd just go over some of the things we've\ntalked about in our introduction about\n\n22\n00:01:08.784 --> 00:01:10.454\nSkype for Business is not Skype.\n\n23\n00:01:10.454 --> 00:01:10.963\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n24\n00:01:10.963 --> 00:01:14.146\n&gt;&gt; So you've got to make sure that\nyou're signing into the right one, and\n\n25\n00:01:14.146 --> 00:01:15.799\nthen are we using the right account?\n\n26\n00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.742\nWhich account are we using for Skype for\nBusiness, and so on and so forth.\n\n27\n00:01:19.742 --> 00:01:24.561\nSo we're gonna go through that and\nthen some things about closing versus\n\n28\n00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:28.831\nexiting and where does it go,\ncuz that could be a little tricky.\n\n29\n00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:33.642\nI know it kind of throws me off sometimes,\nit's like, I actually didn't sign out, and\n\n30\n00:01:33.642 --> 00:01:35.696\nthen, like you said, the interface.\n\n31\n00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:37.883\nJust like any Office product,\nwe want to know,\n\n32\n00:01:37.883 --> 00:01:39.589\nwhat is that menu bar across the top?\n\n33\n00:01:39.589 --> 00:01:43.097\nAnd what are these different buttons\nthat we'll probably call by different\n\n34\n00:01:43.097 --> 00:01:44.694\nterminology later down the road.\n\n35\n00:01:44.694 --> 00:01:49.752\nBut what are they really called, so we can\ngo ahead and get ready to work with Skype.\n\n36\n00:01:49.752 --> 00:01:52.711\nLet's go ahead and\njump down into my computer.\n\n37\n00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:59.617\nNow I've actually kind of signed out of\nSkype and everything before we've started.\n\n38\n00:01:59.617 --> 00:02:03.586\nBecause normally when you\nstart your session of Windows,\n\n39\n00:02:03.586 --> 00:02:06.344\nyou go ahead and log into your computer.\n\n40\n00:02:06.344 --> 00:02:09.105\nBecause you know you should always\nbe locking your computer and\n\n41\n00:02:09.105 --> 00:02:12.404\nsigning out everyday, don't stay\nsigned in, it's bad security stuff.\n\n42\n00:02:12.404 --> 00:02:15.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I went ahead and started\n\n43\n00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.556\nWindows, and actually it brought up\neverything because I've been using Skype.\n\n44\n00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:23.582\nI've already signed in with all\nmy credentials at least once.\n\n45\n00:02:23.582 --> 00:02:28.096\nSo I wanted to try to get it back to,\none, it's not automatically starting,\n\n46\n00:02:28.096 --> 00:02:31.783\nbecause maybe that's a preference\nthat you have determined.\n\n47\n00:02:31.783 --> 00:02:34.172\nIt is the default preference,\nthough, right, Ronnie?\n\n48\n00:02:34.172 --> 00:02:34.956\n&gt;&gt; As far as I know,\n\n49\n00:02:34.956 --> 00:02:38.375\nif you're signed in with your regular\naccount that your using anyways.\n\n50\n00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:40.664\nIt's probably going to take\na look at that and fill it in and\n\n51\n00:02:40.664 --> 00:02:43.258\nautomatically get you signed in,\nif you've asked it to, yeah.\n\n52\n00:02:43.258 --> 00:02:46.211\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, with your Office 365\nsubscription and everything like that.\n\n53\n00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:47.636\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe the very first time,\n\n54\n00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:51.316\nbecause we're going through the steps of,\nhey, you just went ahead and\n\n55\n00:02:51.316 --> 00:02:52.292\ninstalled Skype.\n\n56\n00:02:52.292 --> 00:02:55.712\nThe very first time, it is gonna go\nahead and sit on that sign in screen,\n\n57\n00:02:55.712 --> 00:02:57.772\nwhich I'm gonna show you in just a second.\n\n58\n00:02:57.772 --> 00:03:01.698\nBut, I just wanted to let you know\nthat some of this stuff might happen\n\n59\n00:03:01.698 --> 00:03:03.944\nautomatically for you when you log in.\n\n60\n00:03:03.944 --> 00:03:07.692\nBut I'm gonna just kinda get us back to,\nhey, well, let's go ahead and\n\n61\n00:03:07.692 --> 00:03:09.484\njust start Skype up to begin with.\n\n62\n00:03:09.484 --> 00:03:12.452\nSo just like any application,\nwe're gonna go to our Window menu.\n\n63\n00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:16.784\nI tend to never go to this button and just\ngo right to the search and type it in,\n\n64\n00:03:16.784 --> 00:03:19.386\nbecause I really do like\nthe Windows Search.\n\n65\n00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:23.000\nLet's look through our programs and\nlet's go into the S's,\n\n66\n00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.794\nI'm scrolling a little too fast,\nthere we go.\n\n67\n00:03:25.794 --> 00:03:30.560\nBecause we should really start off with,\nwell, which Skype do I need to use?\n\n68\n00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.245\nSkype for Business.\n\n69\n00:03:31.245 --> 00:03:34.654\nWe've talked about the differences\nbetween normal or regular Skype,\n\n70\n00:03:34.654 --> 00:03:35.571\nif you want to say.\n\n71\n00:03:35.571 --> 00:03:37.096\nAnd then the Skype for\n\n72\n00:03:37.096 --> 00:03:43.216\nBusiness to where it's tied in with your\naccount usually within your organization.\n\n73\n00:03:43.216 --> 00:03:47.043\nSo we need to go ahead and\nstart that one up first, so\n\n74\n00:03:47.043 --> 00:03:51.503\nwe'll get this going, and\nI do have it in this sign in page.\n\n75\n00:03:51.503 --> 00:03:54.598\nAgain, if you're already logged in or\nsigned in at least once or twice,\n\n76\n00:03:54.598 --> 00:03:57.103\nit might go ahead and\njust start automatically, as well.\n\n77\n00:03:57.103 --> 00:04:02.056\nBut this is normally, hey,\nI need to actually have you\n\n78\n00:04:02.056 --> 00:04:05.943\ntell me what account\nyou need to sign in as.\n\n79\n00:04:05.943 --> 00:04:09.004\nAnd notice right here,\nI do have already in there.\n\n80\n00:04:09.004 --> 00:04:14.902\nThe jt@officeprodemocode.onmicrosoft.com,\nour nice long email address, [LAUGH].\n\n81\n00:04:14.902 --> 00:04:19.774\nBut just so you know,\nI could just as easily sign in\n\n82\n00:04:19.774 --> 00:04:23.144\nwith my vonne@itprotv account.\n\n83\n00:04:23.144 --> 00:04:27.381\nAnd go ahead and use Skype for\nBusiness on that particular account.\n\n84\n00:04:27.381 --> 00:04:31.681\nWhich would show a completely different\ncontact list and everything, so\n\n85\n00:04:31.681 --> 00:04:35.510\nI can use different sign ins within\nthis application if I need to.\n\n86\n00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.186\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and stay with JT,\n\n87\n00:04:38.186 --> 00:04:41.899\nbecause this is also\nconnected to JT's Office 365.\n\n88\n00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:45.965\nAll of my Outlook and everything that's\nconfigured on this particular computer,\n\n89\n00:04:45.965 --> 00:04:48.124\nbut just to let you know\nthat you can do that.\n\n90\n00:04:48.124 --> 00:04:51.940\nAlso notice that it does say right there,\nuse the sign-in address for\n\n91\n00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.111\nyour organization.\n\n92\n00:04:53.111 --> 00:05:00.660\nNot your Skype, normal Skype, name or your\nMicrosoft account, those are different.\n\n93\n00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.681\nWe've talked about that with how all of\nthis is connected to a Microsoft account.\n\n94\n00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:11.617\nBut this is specifically for JT's\nOfficeProDemoCoNetworkandOrganization.\n\n95\n00:05:11.617 --> 00:05:15.257\nThat's the one I need to go ahead and\nsign in as.\n\n96\n00:05:15.257 --> 00:05:19.904\nAnd notice I can go ahead and\nset my status right here if I wanted to.\n\n97\n00:05:19.904 --> 00:05:24.675\nWhat is my availability, but we'll talk\na little bit more about our status and\n\n98\n00:05:24.675 --> 00:05:27.218\nour presence once we go ahead and sign in.\n\n99\n00:05:27.218 --> 00:05:31.195\nBut right now you can see the interface\nis just a smaller window,\n\n100\n00:05:31.195 --> 00:05:33.561\nit does have our menus across the top.\n\n101\n00:05:33.561 --> 00:05:37.404\nAnd right now, while I'm not signed in,\nI can still go to the File menu,\n\n102\n00:05:37.404 --> 00:05:38.916\nI can go into the Tools menu.\n\n103\n00:05:38.916 --> 00:05:42.140\nI can even go into the Options,\n\n104\n00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.860\neither here or\nover here in the little wheel.\n\n105\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.560\nWhere I could just go ahead and click,\nand it brings me into my Skype for\n\n106\n00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.651\nBusiness options,\nbecause it's still an application.\n\n107\n00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:57.686\nIt's a little program, so\nI can go ahead and configure it,\n\n108\n00:05:57.686 --> 00:06:01.737\nthat's not connected right\nnow to my Office 365 log in.\n\n109\n00:06:01.737 --> 00:06:05.625\nSo notice how the general and the personal\nand the audio and video set up.\n\n110\n00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:07.371\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncancel that right here.\n\n111\n00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:10.595\nBecause we'll be getting back into\nour preferences a little bit more\n\n112\n00:06:10.595 --> 00:06:13.666\nonce we've signed in, so\nlet's go ahead and click that button.\n\n113\n00:06:13.666 --> 00:06:16.645\nI know, that seemed like a lot of\nexplanation for just go ahead and\n\n114\n00:06:16.645 --> 00:06:17.521\nclick the button.\n\n115\n00:06:17.521 --> 00:06:21.711\nBut, we like to go ahead and start you\nfrom, I assume you know nothing and\n\n116\n00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:23.649\nyou're starting from scratch.\n\n117\n00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:25.773\nSo we like to go ahead and\ntake it a little slow.\n\n118\n00:06:25.773 --> 00:06:30.306\nSo now that I've gone ahead and\nsigned into my account,\n\n119\n00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:33.398\nwe have the same menus across the top.\n\n120\n00:06:33.398 --> 00:06:36.343\nThey didn't change,\nsince I've signed in, but\n\n121\n00:06:36.343 --> 00:06:40.140\nthe tools are still the same options\nin here, and I have my help.\n\n122\n00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.202\nBut if I do go into the Options,\nand again,\n\n123\n00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:46.703\nyou've seen me do it once,\nyou can go from here.\n\n124\n00:06:46.703 --> 00:06:50.194\nOr I can come over here to this\nlittle wheel guy over here, and\n\n125\n00:06:50.194 --> 00:06:53.353\nthat gives you actually\na couple of different things.\n\n126\n00:06:53.353 --> 00:06:58.040\nIt gives you the same menus across the top\nthe file, the meet now, the tools and\n\n127\n00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.186\nthe help, and so you can get there.\n\n128\n00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:04.389\nIf you just single click on this wheel,\nlike directly on the wheel,\n\n129\n00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:06.253\nlet me go ahead and cancel it.\n\n130\n00:07:06.253 --> 00:07:09.460\nNot on the little drop down next to it,\nright on the wheel,\n\n131\n00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.368\nthat brings you into the Options.\n\n132\n00:07:11.368 --> 00:07:15.505\nSo now you can see, there's a whole\nbunch of other things in our options,\n\n133\n00:07:15.505 --> 00:07:18.926\nlike our contacts list and\nour status and different things.\n\n134\n00:07:18.926 --> 00:07:23.876\nBecause now, I'm signed in, so\njust pointing that out there for you.\n\n135\n00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:28.173\nSo we have across the top, like I said,\nthe menus, and then we have our presence.\n\n136\n00:07:28.173 --> 00:07:32.856\nThis is a big thing that you\nhave all over Microsoft,\n\n137\n00:07:32.856 --> 00:07:37.229\nreally in the Office Suite,\nis, where are you?\n\n138\n00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:39.683\nWhat is my little kinda tagline right now?\n\n139\n00:07:39.683 --> 00:07:42.108\nMine just says,\nthis is my presence, [LAUGH],\n\n140\n00:07:42.108 --> 00:07:44.228\nI don't have anything fancy right now.\n\n141\n00:07:44.228 --> 00:07:47.608\nIt's just letting people know when\nthey add me to their Skype for\n\n142\n00:07:47.608 --> 00:07:49.937\nBusiness and\nthey see me in their contacts.\n\n143\n00:07:49.937 --> 00:07:52.450\nWhat am I saying right now?\n\n144\n00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.977\nAlso it's your little tagline,\nand then you can see,\n\n145\n00:07:55.977 --> 00:08:00.742\nI have my photograph, now this is\nconnected to my Office 365 account.\n\n146\n00:08:00.742 --> 00:08:03.739\nSo that's the one that JT has for\nhis photo.\n\n147\n00:08:03.739 --> 00:08:08.040\nNotice, if I hover over it, it does\ngive me the option to change my photo.\n\n148\n00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.152\nI can go into that.\n\n149\n00:08:09.152 --> 00:08:10.180\nI'm gonna keep that just for\n\n150\n00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.960\na little bit later because that gets\ninto your Office 365 account settings.\n\n151\n00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.543\nSo we'll circle back on\nwhere that takes you to.\n\n152\n00:08:19.543 --> 00:08:22.560\nNotice it has my name,\nJustin Timberlake, yes, that's me.\n\n153\n00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.613\nAnd then it has my status.\n\n154\n00:08:25.613 --> 00:08:28.978\nNow notice right now my status says busy.\n\n155\n00:08:28.978 --> 00:08:29.714\nWhy?\n\n156\n00:08:29.714 --> 00:08:34.924\nWell, like we said,\nit's all connected with your Outlook and\n\n157\n00:08:34.924 --> 00:08:37.450\nyour Outlook calendar.\n\n158\n00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.868\nSo right now in my Outlook calendar,\n\n159\n00:08:39.868 --> 00:08:44.942\nI have an appointment that I'm supposed\nto be doing a show with you, Ronnie.\n\n160\n00:08:44.942 --> 00:08:45.760\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n161\n00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.618\nso it is showing me that it is busy\ncuz it's all connected that way.\n\n162\n00:08:49.618 --> 00:08:54.566\nSo other people are going\nto be seeing me as busy.\n\n163\n00:08:54.566 --> 00:08:55.804\nThat's just where I can change it.\n\n164\n00:08:55.804 --> 00:08:59.421\nBut notice of course, this is connected\nto Outlook, I could change it.\n\n165\n00:08:59.421 --> 00:09:00.904\nSo I can override that.\n\n166\n00:09:00.904 --> 00:09:04.067\nCuz maybe this appointment,\nit didn't happen, and\n\n167\n00:09:04.067 --> 00:09:06.607\nI didn't wanna delete it off my calendar.\n\n168\n00:09:06.607 --> 00:09:10.656\nBut I just wanted to show everybody\nin Skype that I'm available.\n\n169\n00:09:10.656 --> 00:09:14.000\nSo you can go ahead and\nchange that to Available, Do Not Disturb.\n\n170\n00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.370\nAnd we'll talk about what it means to\nactually put your status as Do Not Disturb\n\n171\n00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.300\nwhen we get into more of\nthe communications and our options.\n\n172\n00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.807\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne, if we do this and\nwe accept an appointment in Outlook, so\n\n173\n00:09:23.807 --> 00:09:26.014\njust make sure I'm thinking this right.\n\n174\n00:09:26.014 --> 00:09:30.575\nSo you send me an appointment, and\nI accept it as well, and it's that\n\n175\n00:09:30.575 --> 00:09:36.256\nparticular time of the meeting, you should\nget that status where it changes to busy?\n\n176\n00:09:36.256 --> 00:09:41.010\nAnd should I also automatically have that\non my end also changed to busy if it's\n\n177\n00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.100\na Skype meeting?\n\n178\n00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.262\n&gt;&gt; If we're on the same appointment or\nmeeting, yes.\n\n179\n00:09:44.262 --> 00:09:46.490\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cool, awesome.\n\n180\n00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.424\n&gt;&gt; Cuz right now my meeting or\nmy appointment, it's only for me.\n\n181\n00:09:50.424 --> 00:09:54.536\nSo it's on my personal calendar, but if-\n&gt;&gt; I accept it.\n\n182\n00:09:54.536 --> 00:09:55.154\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n183\n00:09:55.154 --> 00:09:56.118\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cool, awesome.\n\n184\n00:09:56.118 --> 00:09:56.649\n&gt;&gt; All of that.\n\n185\n00:09:56.649 --> 00:09:58.597\nAnd you know what, let's actually go\nto those little buttons right now.\n\n186\n00:09:58.597 --> 00:10:02.179\nBecause I'm gonna skip\nthe location just for a second.\n\n187\n00:10:02.179 --> 00:10:06.549\nBut this is a great point to put in,\nnotice these buttons across the middle,\n\n188\n00:10:06.549 --> 00:10:07.651\nwe'll call this?\n\n189\n00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:08.399\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n190\n00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:12.090\n&gt;&gt; We have like what looks like\na little person which is our contacts.\n\n191\n00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.740\nWe have our conversations, and this is\nwhere it's going to store all of our\n\n192\n00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.770\nconversations, and\nthen we have our meetings.\n\n193\n00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:20.221\nLet's click on that.\n\n194\n00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:22.946\nAnd in our meetings,\nnotice I have two of them on there.\n\n195\n00:10:22.946 --> 00:10:27.651\nRight now I have Skype for\nBusiness with Ronnie from 2:15 to 3:45.\n\n196\n00:10:27.651 --> 00:10:32.262\nAnd so we're in that window right now,\nso that's why my status is showing that.\n\n197\n00:10:32.262 --> 00:10:35.817\nAnd I also put Julie's birthday cuz it is\nmy best friend Julie's birthday today.\n\n198\n00:10:35.817 --> 00:10:36.341\n&gt;&gt; Happy birthday,\nJulie even though you all are\n\n199\n00:10:36.341 --> 00:10:36.943\nprobably watching us,\nwell, not on her birthday.\n\n200\n00:10:36.943 --> 00:10:41.854\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But I went ahead and\n\n201\n00:10:41.854 --> 00:10:44.970\nput that in with my Outlook calendar.\n\n202\n00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.712\nNow if we had a meeting,\nif we actually set up a meeting,\n\n203\n00:10:48.712 --> 00:10:52.550\nI would actually have another\nlittle button over there.\n\n204\n00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.260\nWhen we get into Setting\nup Skype meetings,\n\n205\n00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.890\nthere will be something else in there.\n\n206\n00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:05.440\nThat is why my status is connected\nto my current calender in Outlook.\n\n207\n00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.330\nAnd let's go through\nthe rest of those buttons.\n\n208\n00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:09.430\nWe're kinda jumping around.\n\n209\n00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.554\nWe're going through the interface and\neverything.\n\n210\n00:11:11.554 --> 00:11:12.532\nThe conversations.\n\n211\n00:11:12.532 --> 00:11:16.296\nNow, anytime that you have\ncommunication with somebody,\n\n212\n00:11:16.296 --> 00:11:19.982\nwhether we're doing chat or\nwe're doing a voice call, or\n\n213\n00:11:19.982 --> 00:11:24.430\nwe're doing a video call,\nthey're all called conversations.\n\n214\n00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.300\nAnd you can see that,\nonce I get into here,\n\n215\n00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.370\nI have some other we'll call them tabs,\nfor lack of better term.\n\n216\n00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:34.408\nI have All, I have Missed,\nand I have Calls.\n\n217\n00:11:34.408 --> 00:11:37.200\nSo you could see that I have\ndifferent ones in here and\n\n218\n00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.450\nhow they're cataloguing it.\n\n219\n00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:43.225\nNotice in the All, I have some different\nicons in here like one looks like a phone.\n\n220\n00:11:43.225 --> 00:11:45.564\nOne looks like a little piece of paper.\n\n221\n00:11:45.564 --> 00:11:47.193\nAnd I believe there's a couple, yeah,\n\n222\n00:11:47.193 --> 00:11:49.241\nthere's one that looks like\na little video in there.\n\n223\n00:11:49.241 --> 00:11:52.263\nBecause those are the different\ntypes of communications or\n\n224\n00:11:52.263 --> 00:11:54.575\nconversations I've had with people.\n\n225\n00:11:54.575 --> 00:11:58.841\nLot of it testing it out, and so on and\nso forth, but that's why we have our All.\n\n226\n00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:02.233\nAnd we'll talk about the missed\nconversations when we get into\n\n227\n00:12:02.233 --> 00:12:06.843\nthe chatting and what happens if somebody\ntries to contact you and you're not there.\n\n228\n00:12:06.843 --> 00:12:10.925\nWell, it's just like you have a phone,\nyour regular iPhone, well,\n\n229\n00:12:10.925 --> 00:12:11.973\nI have an iPhone.\n\n230\n00:12:11.973 --> 00:12:15.343\n[LAUGH] Like I missed a call,\nand it shows up in there.\n\n231\n00:12:15.343 --> 00:12:17.105\nAnd then the last one, well,\nI guess it's not the last.\n\n232\n00:12:17.105 --> 00:12:18.453\nReally the first, right?\n\n233\n00:12:18.453 --> 00:12:20.100\nWe have our little person.\n\n234\n00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:24.180\nThis is where we have our contacts,\nand notice we have groups.\n\n235\n00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.160\nAnd we'll talk about organizing and\nadding our contacts.\n\n236\n00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.340\nWe have our status of whether\nthey are online or away.\n\n237\n00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.470\nWe have our relationships.\n\n238\n00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.180\nAnd we'll talk about the different\nprivacy relationships and what they mean.\n\n239\n00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.260\nAnd why you might want\nto move people in and\n\n240\n00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.706\nout of those different\ntypes of relationships.\n\n241\n00:12:40.706 --> 00:12:41.560\nAnd then we have New.\n\n242\n00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.390\nAs you could see, it says people who\nhave added you will show up here.\n\n243\n00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.940\nTalk more about that in the context.\n\n244\n00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.040\nAgain, we're just going over\nthe interface right now.\n\n245\n00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.328\nSo those are the different\nbuttons that we have for\n\n246\n00:12:52.328 --> 00:12:57.272\nour main pieces of Skype, our Contacts,\nConversations, and Meetings.\n\n247\n00:12:57.272 --> 00:13:02.218\nWe have our presence, our status,\nthat we can always override, and\n\n248\n00:13:02.218 --> 00:13:04.197\nthen we have our location.\n\n249\n00:13:04.197 --> 00:13:07.151\nNow, right now,\nit shows me that I'm at ITProTV.\n\n250\n00:13:07.151 --> 00:13:07.928\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n251\n00:13:07.928 --> 00:13:08.692\n&gt;&gt; That's where we are.\n\n252\n00:13:08.692 --> 00:13:14.450\n[LAUGH] But\nnotice I have a little no sign over there.\n\n253\n00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:21.040\nBecause I'm not sharing out my\nlocation to everybody or to\n\n254\n00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:26.520\nthe people that I have within my different\noptions of who I want to see my location.\n\n255\n00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.230\nNotice there's a dropdown right here.\n\n256\n00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.213\nAnd I put a couple other ones in there.\n\n257\n00:13:30.213 --> 00:13:33.991\nNow notice that with a dropdown,\nI have show others my location.\n\n258\n00:13:33.991 --> 00:13:34.938\nSo if I click on that,\n\n259\n00:13:34.938 --> 00:13:37.847\nnow you could see that it doesn't\nhave a little no sign next to it.\n\n260\n00:13:37.847 --> 00:13:41.250\nAnd it is sharing out everything.\n\n261\n00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:45.100\nI could go ahead and click on that again,\nand then have it not show it.\n\n262\n00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:50.764\nBut if I click directly on the at ITProTV,\nI have a couple different options.\n\n263\n00:13:50.764 --> 00:13:53.704\nNotice, first of all, it highlights and\n\n264\n00:13:53.704 --> 00:13:57.654\nshows a field to where I can\ntype in a specific location.\n\n265\n00:13:57.654 --> 00:14:01.417\nCuz maybe I'm at the airport and\nI'm gonna be at the airport for\n\n266\n00:14:01.417 --> 00:14:04.030\nthe next two hours waiting on a flight.\n\n267\n00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.660\nI could go ahead and\nput that's where I'm at.\n\n268\n00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.130\nOf course, why would you wanna do this?\n\n269\n00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.260\nSkype for Business is a way a lot\nof organizations stay connected.\n\n270\n00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:12.760\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n271\n00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.550\nyou wanna go ahead and put your location.\n\n272\n00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:18.070\nBut notice now there's a little dropdown\nall the way over to the other side.\n\n273\n00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.100\nBecause, well, let's try that again.\n\n274\n00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.012\nThere is a dropdown.\n\n275\n00:14:21.012 --> 00:14:25.290\nWhoop, okay, I was trying to go ahead and\nshow you that it will drop down and\n\n276\n00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.130\nshow you the other locations.\n\n277\n00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.050\nYou have saved locations in there.\n\n278\n00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:34.310\nAnd that's where it's going to let you\nknow, maybe you have to share it first and\n\n279\n00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.370\nthen we go with that.\n\n280\n00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:39.282\nOkay, maybe I didn't put\nthe rest of them in there.\n\n281\n00:14:39.282 --> 00:14:45.680\nBut you're supposed to be able to\nbecause I had some other ones.\n\n282\n00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.950\nAnyways, I'll fix that.\n\n283\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.180\nI'll double-check on whether that happens.\n\n284\n00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:52.356\nBut normally, it should go ahead and\nchange to our saved locations,\n\n285\n00:14:52.356 --> 00:14:55.677\nas to where you can choose\nfrom a little dropdown menu.\n\n286\n00:14:55.677 --> 00:14:58.210\nSo don't just go with what mine's showing.\n\n287\n00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:02.840\nDo yours and see if you can go ahead and\nget those saved locations in there.\n\n288\n00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.900\nAll right, a few other things\nthat we have in our interface.\n\n289\n00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.000\nOf course, we have our windows.\n\n290\n00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.080\nWe could go ahead and maximize,\nwe can go ahead and minimize.\n\n291\n00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.554\nAnd we can close.\n\n292\n00:15:13.554 --> 00:15:15.521\nCome back around to what\nthat actually means.\n\n293\n00:15:15.521 --> 00:15:20.040\nAnd then the last one is just down here on\nthe bottom left-hand corner of where you\n\n294\n00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.860\ncan select your devices.\n\n295\n00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.440\nWe're gonna talk about our audio and\nvideo devices and our setups.\n\n296\n00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.350\nAnd we have a whole other episode on that.\n\n297\n00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:31.250\nBut that little button will allow you,\nbecause if you have different\n\n298\n00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.520\nconfigurations, you could go ahead and\nchoose them.\n\n299\n00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.260\nSo those are the buttons.\n\n300\n00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.120\nSo this is always running, right?\n\n301\n00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.490\nWell, it is always running\nin the background.\n\n302\n00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.770\nLet's go ahead and\nlook at some of those options first.\n\n303\n00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:44.858\nLet's come over here.\n\n304\n00:15:44.858 --> 00:15:48.305\nNotice that I have,\nwhere it's show call controls.\n\n305\n00:15:48.305 --> 00:15:50.256\nAnd in my personal, right here,\n\n306\n00:15:50.256 --> 00:15:54.383\nit says it's automatically starting\nthe app when I log in to Windows.\n\n307\n00:15:54.383 --> 00:15:58.611\nCuz that was the thing that we were\ntalking about before it normally does.\n\n308\n00:15:58.611 --> 00:16:01.931\nBut I told it to stop, so we could\ngo ahead and see all that sign in.\n\n309\n00:16:01.931 --> 00:16:06.624\nAnd then start the app in the foreground\nBut now we're going to talk about where\n\n310\n00:16:06.624 --> 00:16:11.100\nit's going to always be running in\nthe background, even if you close it.\n\n311\n00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.810\nIt's totally different.\n\n312\n00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:15.450\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Closing and exiting, and signing out,\n\n313\n00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.560\nif you want to say,\ntotally different stuff.\n\n314\n00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.530\nAlso, just a few more\nthings while we're here.\n\n315\n00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:23.390\nNotice that the Skype contact information,\nbetween Skype for Business and\n\n316\n00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.950\nExchange, that's where it's all updated by\npresence based on my calendar information.\n\n317\n00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.280\nAll of these are on by default.\n\n318\n00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.648\nI have not changed any of these\ndefaults that I can remember.\n\n319\n00:16:32.648 --> 00:16:33.637\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n320\n00:16:33.637 --> 00:16:37.230\nnotice that it does show\nthe whole updating my presence.\n\n321\n00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.450\nYou know what?\nMaybe it's because it\n\n322\n00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:39.680\nthinks that I'm busy.\n\n323\n00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.780\n&gt;&gt; That's why my location.\n\n324\n00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.220\n&gt;&gt; That could be.\n\n325\n00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.616\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nI bet you that's why,\n\n326\n00:16:43.616 --> 00:16:45.026\nI think I just solved it, hey.\n\n327\n00:16:45.026 --> 00:16:46.336\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Good [LAUGH] and\n\n328\n00:16:46.336 --> 00:16:51.039\nthen you can see some things where it\nis talking about privacy relationships,\n\n329\n00:16:51.039 --> 00:16:55.612\nabout what your out of office actually\nmeans and what other people will see.\n\n330\n00:16:55.612 --> 00:17:00.390\nAgain more in our context in when\nwe get into our conversations.\n\n331\n00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:04.020\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, in that section in\nparticular that says exchange and\n\n332\n00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.930\nwhat we see right there,\nmost of us are probably not going to be\n\n333\n00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:12.840\nreally changing that unless\nsomebody tells us too, right?\n\n334\n00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:17.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and I think, and\nthis might be a question for\n\n335\n00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.930\nyou, you might not have\nany control over that.\n\n336\n00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:20.470\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n337\n00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:26.070\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because of however your network\nadministrator has set up your Office 365.\n\n338\n00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.650\nIt could just be completely greyed out.\n\n339\n00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:33.650\nYes, so it's like you can't unsync\nit [LAUGH], you're going to sync it.\n\n340\n00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.000\nNow, I have a lot more controls,\nsince this is-\n\n341\n00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.580\n&gt;&gt; Lab environment and\n\n342\n00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.570\nyou're an adminnistrator.\n\n343\n00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:42.834\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm pretty sure Joe is\neven a better administrator or\n\n344\n00:17:42.834 --> 00:17:46.550\nhad other options within our little\noffice pro demo code that we use.\n\n345\n00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.422\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So definitely check that out.\n\n346\n00:17:48.422 --> 00:17:52.094\nAnd we will talk about what it means\nactually to save conversations,\n\n347\n00:17:52.094 --> 00:17:56.338\nwhere it goes into our conversation\nhistory, again just showing you that there\n\n348\n00:17:56.338 --> 00:18:00.330\na lot of options in here that you may or\nmay not be [LAUGH] able to change.\n\n349\n00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:00.930\nBut where there are.\n\n350\n00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.470\nNotice like with our contact list,\nwe'll talk about that, our status.\n\n351\n00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.540\nThis is where I was telling\nyou about our presence.\n\n352\n00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.860\nI only want people in my\ncontacts to see my presence.\n\n353\n00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:13.420\nDo I wanna broadcast this\nout to the whole world?\n\n354\n00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.370\nLike you were saying, Skype for\nBusiness is very large.\n\n355\n00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.580\nDo I want that to happen?\n\n356\n00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:22.340\nWe will talk about our inactive\nin our way overview right now.\n\n357\n00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.120\nThere's our picture, right?\n\n358\n00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.850\nIf I wanted to change my picture, and\n\n359\n00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:30.630\neven if I clicked on that little\nbutton right out here for my picture.\n\n360\n00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:35.660\nNotice when I click on\nthis it is bringing me to\n\n361\n00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.050\nwhere it's taking me out on to the\nInternet, having me log into my account.\n\n362\n00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.400\nNotice, I can use multiple accounts here.\n\n363\n00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:47.070\nAnd then, it's going to go into\nmy actual Office settings and\n\n364\n00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:51.330\nthis is where I'm going to\nneed to change my photograph.\n\n365\n00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.490\nAnd it's all connected with your accounts,\nsee?\n\n366\n00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:57.010\nRight over there on the right hand panel,\nit's going to go ahead and\n\n367\n00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:58.740\nlet me upload a photo.\n\n368\n00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.030\nSometimes it takes a little while,\ndoesn't it Ronnie?\n\n369\n00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:04.500\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because it's actually, remember,\nwe're not really just changing something\n\n370\n00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:10.240\ninside of our computer, we're actually\nchanging it throughout the entire system.\n\n371\n00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.540\nSo when the system gets updated\nthen that's what happens and\n\n372\n00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.172\nwe don't know where this actual server is.\n\n373\n00:19:16.172 --> 00:19:18.950\nSo it's gonna take a little bit of\ntime when everything gets updated.\n\n374\n00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.730\nSo give that a little bit of time,\ndon't expect it to be immediate.\n\n375\n00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:25.450\nSometimes it might seem instantaneous, but\nother times, it might take a bit of time.\n\n376\n00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.340\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes,\nit takes longer than you think.\n\n377\n00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.158\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n378\n00:19:28.158 --> 00:19:28.692\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n379\n00:19:28.692 --> 00:19:30.068\n&gt;&gt; Like a couple of hours.\n\n380\n00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:30.755\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n381\n00:19:30.755 --> 00:19:33.770\nI have even had it to where I\nhad to wait like overnight.\n\n382\n00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.490\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And then it finally kicked in.\n\n383\n00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:39.300\nSo that can be a little\ntroublesome here and there.\n\n384\n00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.520\nBut that's where we were going\nto change our picture and\n\n385\n00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.690\nhow I had gotten there\nwas from our options.\n\n386\n00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.800\nThat I'm just giving you a quick\noverview about the different things.\n\n387\n00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.780\nYou notice your alerts, your IMs.\n\n388\n00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.870\nWe'll talk about our video and\naudio settings and so forth.\n\n389\n00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:56.190\nBut back into, I believe here.\n\n390\n00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:00.910\nThe personal of how\nit's going to start up,\n\n391\n00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:05.040\nwhether or not you want it\nto start up when you log in.\n\n392\n00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.040\nAnd then the other,\nI believe it's in the general.\n\n393\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.520\nThis is one I want to point out.\n\n394\n00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.640\nIt's right down here.\n\n395\n00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.960\nIt says application window,\nand there's a check box,\n\n396\n00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.000\nminimize to the notification\narea instead of the taskbar.\n\n397\n00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.850\nThat is on, and that's on by default.\n\n398\n00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.750\nYou can turn this off, and\nI'll show you what that means.\n\n399\n00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:25.400\nLet's click ok.\n\n400\n00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:30.700\nSo I don't want to use Skype right now.\n\n401\n00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:37.900\nIf I close this window out right here,\nI'm just closing, I am not out of Skype.\n\n402\n00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.870\nAnd that's where that little\ncheckbox that I wanna point out,\n\n403\n00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.020\nit's like notification area.\n\n404\n00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.815\nNow if you're like, well, where's that?\n\n405\n00:20:43.815 --> 00:20:47.040\n[LAUGH] Well, it's in the bottom right\nhand corner, behind my head right there.\n\n406\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.080\nYou can see that This is\nour notification area and\n\n407\n00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:55.560\nthat little triangly thing right there,\nwhere it says show hidden icons, cuz I\n\n408\n00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.250\nhave a couple of other icons in here like\nmy battery power, and so on and so forth.\n\n409\n00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:03.630\nIf I click on that, you see that little\nguy, it's really hard to see right now.\n\n410\n00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.880\nThat is just the Skype,\nit says that I'm still signed in, okay?\n\n411\n00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.150\nIt is running in the background.\n\n412\n00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:12.900\nThis app will run in the background\neven if you close the window.\n\n413\n00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.380\nWe normally think closed,\nit's like okay we're closing out of Word.\n\n414\n00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.900\nDoesn't happen that way.\n\n415\n00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.940\nNow I'm gonna just single click on this.\n\n416\n00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:24.470\nAnd notice that with here,\nI have the option of I can\n\n417\n00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:28.180\nsign out or exit,\neither one is gonna be the same thing.\n\n418\n00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.310\nBut that means I am leaving Skype.\n\n419\n00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.820\nI am signing out.\n\n420\n00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.760\nI do not even want to be in\nthe system if you wanna say.\n\n421\n00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.190\nSo exiting, that is going to,\n\n422\n00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.640\nnotice how it went out of the notification\narea, I'm really out now.\n\n423\n00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:47.730\nI have exited the application and\nno longer people can contact me.\n\n424\n00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.130\nMake sure you understand that.\n\n425\n00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:52.700\nAnd then that option,\nlet's go ahead and sign back in.\n\n426\n00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.610\nWe'll go ahead and\nbring up Skype for Business.\n\n427\n00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:58.820\nAnd it should go ahead and\nautomatically, see, went ahead and\n\n428\n00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.040\nget me all in there, in that option.\n\n429\n00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:05.190\nIf you don't want to go\nthe notification area,\n\n430\n00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:09.020\nlet me just go ahead and click on that,\nand I'll check that box off.\n\n431\n00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:13.170\nNow if close it,\nit just stays like an application.\n\n432\n00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.740\nAnd that had to be something\nthat people are used to.\n\n433\n00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.210\nLike, I have open applications\ndown on my taskbar.\n\n434\n00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.630\nSo if you want to minimize down\ninto there, go right ahead and\n\n435\n00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.190\nchange that option.\n\n436\n00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:28.100\nBut understanding the minimizing,\nthe bringing this back up,\n\n437\n00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:32.170\nor exiting the actual application.\n\n438\n00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:33.880\nThat takes me all the way out.\n\n439\n00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.890\nSo those are the little things that get\npeople tripped up because they're like\n\n440\n00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.570\nI don't know why people\nare still contacting me.\n\n441\n00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:39.871\nThey are still IM'ing me.\n\n442\n00:22:39.871 --> 00:22:42.705\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like because you are still on.\n\n443\n00:22:42.705 --> 00:22:44.047\nIt shows hey I'm here.\n\n444\n00:22:44.047 --> 00:22:47.190\nEven if your status is busy and\nthe do not disturb.\n\n445\n00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.210\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Depending on your other options you\n\n446\n00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.980\nhave, people still might\nbe able to contact.\n\n447\n00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:57.040\nSo if you want to be like completely\nunplugged go ahead and exit or sign out.\n\n448\n00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.020\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne,\nwell thank you again for\n\n449\n00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.550\nshowing us around inside of the Skype for\nBusiness app.\n\n450\n00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.340\nIt seems like that there's a lot more\ninformation there than we first thought\n\n451\n00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:10.300\nwhich we might have actually only used\nas an instant messaging platform and\n\n452\n00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.000\nthen think about anything else.\n\n453\n00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.920\nSo Vonne has showed you here it\nactually does tie in to Exchange,\n\n454\n00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.580\ngives us that ability\nto use other things and\n\n455\n00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.240\nintegrate along with it as\nwell as the sign-in options.\n\n456\n00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.790\nRemember that there is a difference\nbetween sign in in Skype and Skype for\n\n457\n00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.146\nBusiness as well.\n\n458\n00:23:25.146 --> 00:23:30.040\nAll right, Vonne, so any other last words,\nor wisdom tips, that you can provide for\n\n459\n00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.210\nus before we sign out.\n\n460\n00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:35.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like what you said, about\na lot of people just use this as a chat.\n\n461\n00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:39.600\nBut there is so much more that you can do,\nand those little options,\n\n462\n00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.970\neven me, cuz I was just, it always\njust goes into the notification area.\n\n463\n00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:44.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I was like,\n\n464\n00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.580\nyou can put it down in the task?\n\n465\n00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:50.880\nThat's pretty cool, cuz I've never taken\nthe time, honestly, to go through it.\n\n466\n00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.160\nWhen I was using it in my job at\nthe university it was, just go.\n\n467\n00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.700\nThis is how it works.\n\n468\n00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:01.000\nAnd now the more I've really dove\ninto the product, I'm like, wow,\n\n469\n00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.030\nyou can really change a lot of things.\n\n470\n00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.150\nThere's a lot of different things.\n\n471\n00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:08.570\nSo I think this whole series is gonna\nbe one of those where we're gonna\n\n472\n00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:12.430\nshow you a lot of things of what Skype can\ndo that you probably didn't realize it.\n\n473\n00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:13.220\nI know I didn't.\n\n474\n00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:17.306\nSo, I'm kinda excited to show you all\nthe little buttons and everything.\n\n475\n00:24:17.306 --> 00:24:19.210\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne, there's a lot for\n\n476\n00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.510\nus to look forward to in Skype for\nBusiness.\n\n477\n00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:24.490\nBut this is a great place for\nus to end this episode as well.\n\n478\n00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:28.240\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n479\n00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.210\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n480\n00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.228\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Skype for Business shows.\n\n481\n00:24:32.228 --> 00:24:37.140\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Well, I've graduated to diva status.\n\n12\n00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:40.601\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n13\n00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:41.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n14\n00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.500\nso Vonne,\nwhen we start to take a look here,\n\n15\n00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.510\na lot of times we get the software setup\nand everything can work perfectly.\n\n16\n00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.920\nWe don't ever have to do that.\n\n17\n00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.560\nBut every once in a while,\nwe find out something.\n\n18\n00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.550\nIt doesn't work exactly\nthe way you want to,\n\n19\n00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.710\nespecially when we're\nconnecting the cloud stuff.\n\n20\n00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.270\nVonne, what are we taking\na look at here first?\n\n21\n00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.618\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, audio and video, oof.\n\n22\n00:00:59.618 --> 00:01:05.451\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is gonna be such a sticking point,\n\n23\n00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:06.380\nI know.\n\n24\n00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.860\nPersonally, I've had\na lot of issues with it.\n\n25\n00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.410\nAnd then using it in meetings,\nwhether I'm using Skype for\n\n26\n00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.000\nBusiness or Adobe Connect, GoToMeeting.\n\n27\n00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.105\nAll these other different platforms that\nwe can use to go ahead and collaborate,\n\n28\n00:01:22.105 --> 00:01:26.840\nit’s always something like somebody's\naudio, nope, can't hear you still.\n\n29\n00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.660\nCan you hear me now?\n\n30\n00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.435\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Can you hear me now?\n\n31\n00:01:28.435 --> 00:01:32.112\n[LAUGH] That is not working and\nthen the video doesn't work.\n\n32\n00:01:32.112 --> 00:01:35.750\nI will tell you right now that even though\nwe have an entire episode on how to set it\n\n33\n00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.436\nup and\n\n34\n00:01:36.436 --> 00:01:40.120\nhow to troubleshoot it, this will not\nguarantee that you won't run into issues.\n\n35\n00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.704\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n36\n00:01:40.704 --> 00:01:42.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, it can be a little weird.\n\n37\n00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.800\nAnd it could be, I always call\nit like the Gremlins are out or\n\n38\n00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.330\nthe hamsters not running in the wheel.\n\n39\n00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.790\nSo you can go ahead and I just get\neverything working great on one place and\n\n40\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.190\nthen come into Skype and\nit's still broken.\n\n41\n00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.830\nSo, I'm just practicing that right now.\n\n42\n00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.877\nSo you don't kind of take everything\nas this is always gonna work for\n\n43\n00:02:04.877 --> 00:02:06.156\nyou, cuz it won't.\n\n44\n00:02:06.156 --> 00:02:08.795\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can almost guarantee it, so, but\n\n45\n00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:09.901\nlet's go ahead and\n\n46\n00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:14.625\nlook at where we can go to the different\nplaces to set up our devices within Skype.\n\n47\n00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:17.745\nAnd then we're gonna go\noutside of Skype and\n\n48\n00:02:17.745 --> 00:02:21.495\ntalk about our actual\ncomputer configuration.\n\n49\n00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:23.397\nAnd I know that's where you\nhave a lot of expertise.\n\n50\n00:02:23.397 --> 00:02:26.065\nSo, I might be asking you some\ndifferent questions this morning.\n\n51\n00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:30.398\nAll right, so let's jump down into,\nhere we've got, Logged in.\n\n52\n00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:33.245\nSo you can see it's right where we are,\nI changed my presence by the way.\n\n53\n00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:35.915\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; I have testing audio and video.\n\n54\n00:02:35.915 --> 00:02:39.860\nYes with an exclamation point to\ntry to keep us happy about this.\n\n55\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.020\nAnd I did change my status,\nif you're watching this in this session,\n\n56\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.120\nI did go ahead and go over\nthe interface and everything like that.\n\n57\n00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.390\nMy dropdown's working again.\n\n58\n00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.675\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; He's broken the last episode,\n\n59\n00:02:50.675 --> 00:02:53.450\nthere's another one, Gremlins.\n\n60\n00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.460\nGremlins, I have no idea why that dropdown\nwasn't behaving the way I wanted it to in\n\n61\n00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.560\nthat last episode.\n\n62\n00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.980\nBut we did exit out of Skype and\nthen restarted Skype, the whole.\n\n63\n00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.970\nDid you try turning it on and\nturning it off again?\n\n64\n00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:08.670\n&gt;&gt; It works.\n\n65\n00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.855\n&gt;&gt; It helped, right?\n\n66\n00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:11.040\nIt does work sometimes.\n\n67\n00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.720\nSo just that, I think might have\nfixed that little dropdown.\n\n68\n00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.205\nOr at least, you know what,\nthat's what I'm going with for right now.\n\n69\n00:03:17.205 --> 00:03:18.908\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n70\n00:03:18.908 --> 00:03:21.082\nwhere do I go to in Skype?\n\n71\n00:03:21.082 --> 00:03:23.765\nFind where my audio and video setups are.\n\n72\n00:03:23.765 --> 00:03:28.096\nWhen I was down here, we did have the\nlittle box down at the bottom left-hand\n\n73\n00:03:28.096 --> 00:03:33.910\ncorner that has, like right now, my custom\ndevice is configured within my settings.\n\n74\n00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.100\nRight below it,\nI can go to my audio settings.\n\n75\n00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.200\nAnd that's gonna take\nus in to our options.\n\n76\n00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.720\nYou could go in to your tools and\ngo into options.\n\n77\n00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.370\nYou could go in to, right from here,\naudio and video device settings or\n\n78\n00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.150\nthe little button.\n\n79\n00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.000\nAll's gonna lead you to the same place.\n\n80\n00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.340\nAll to the options and then in to\nthe audio device and the video device.\n\n81\n00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.020\nSo these are the two places\nthat you are going to go and\n\n82\n00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.970\nconfigure the different things.\n\n83\n00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.505\nNow, my computer right now,\nI don't have external speakers.\n\n84\n00:04:03.505 --> 00:04:04.292\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n85\n00:04:04.292 --> 00:04:06.450\nBut, if you go into Tim's office.\n\n86\n00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.480\n&gt;&gt; He's got some external speakers.\n\n87\n00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.373\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n88\n00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:09.266\n&gt;&gt; Lots.\n\n89\n00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:10.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n90\n00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.690\nHe's got all sorts of different\nmicrophones, and speakers, and\n\n91\n00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.900\nall sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n92\n00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.982\nSo, if you have multiple devices\nconnected to your computer,\n\n93\n00:04:20.982 --> 00:04:23.516\nthey should show up here.\n\n94\n00:04:23.516 --> 00:04:28.872\nNow I noticed my speakers,\nI have this AMD High Definition and\n\n95\n00:04:28.872 --> 00:04:32.460\nI also have this Cirrus Logic.\n\n96\n00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.550\nI can tell you right now,\nI don't know what those are.\n\n97\n00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.790\nI don't know where they even came from,\nokay?\n\n98\n00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.040\nBut I know that,\n\n99\n00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.500\nI do know that I am running boot\ncamp on my Macintosh computer.\n\n100\n00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.902\nRunning Windows, I think it's\nsomething to do with my Mac hardware?\n\n101\n00:04:46.902 --> 00:04:47.912\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n102\n00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:52.130\n&gt;&gt; And my Windows operating system\nthat I'm running through there.\n\n103\n00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.690\nIs that, is that safe for\nme to assume there Ronnie?\n\n104\n00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.680\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n105\n00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.250\nThe way that Vonne has\ngot her computer set up.\n\n106\n00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.780\nIt's recognizing the hardware\ninside of the Mac computer and\n\n107\n00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.450\nit's reporting it right here\non the one that she selected.\n\n108\n00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.788\nThe other one is actually getting reported\nbecause of the connection that she's\n\n109\n00:05:08.788 --> 00:05:10.024\nmaking to show you the video.\n\n110\n00:05:10.024 --> 00:05:11.931\nSo even though it actually says speaker,\n\n111\n00:05:11.931 --> 00:05:15.560\nit's expecting that it can send\nvideo even through that connection.\n\n112\n00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.420\nSo that's probably not the one we would\nchoose if we were setting that up\n\n113\n00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.530\nfor Skype.\n\n114\n00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.280\nWe would probably choose the one\nthat's actually the hardware itself,\n\n115\n00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.830\nwhich is gonna be that second option.\n\n116\n00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so again, this is all very\ncustom to whatever your computer does.\n\n117\n00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.660\nSo, you might see a couple\nof different speakers.\n\n118\n00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.310\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n119\n00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.860\n&gt;&gt; And you're like,\nI don't have any other speakers,\n\n120\n00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.820\nit's just the way your hardware is set up.\n\n121\n00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.370\n&gt;&gt; And so, different devices\nwill have different drivers and\n\n122\n00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.920\nthat's what's showing up here.\n\n123\n00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.470\nSo it depends on of course your\ncomputer model and your make whether or\n\n124\n00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.880\nnot those devices will actually\nshow up and those different ways.\n\n125\n00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.500\nWhen you add in something like a USB\ndevice that has speakers in it,\n\n126\n00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.980\nit's probably gonna show up.\n\n127\n00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.710\nAnd when you actually add\nin like another audio cord,\n\n128\n00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.310\nit's probably gonna show up as well.\n\n129\n00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.800\nYou just have to know which\none you're actually picking.\n\n130\n00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.500\nAt this point, for our speakers, it's\njust probably the one we use most often.\n\n131\n00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.350\nAnd you would just have to pick\nup on whichever device driver\n\n132\n00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.540\nyou want set up to hear\nother people through.\n\n133\n00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.900\n&gt;&gt; And the other thing that I've\nnoticed when I put in my earbuds or\n\n134\n00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.400\nmy wired ear buds, not my AirPods.\n\n135\n00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.720\nBut I can't get that to\nconnect with this thing.\n\n136\n00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.920\nBut when I plug that in,\nit'll actually show.\n\n137\n00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.572\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Like earphones or headphones, or\n\n138\n00:06:25.572 --> 00:06:28.688\nwhatever that is connected\nto the computer.\n\n139\n00:06:28.688 --> 00:06:33.571\nAnd I will say just as a small\nside note on my particular setup.\n\n140\n00:06:33.571 --> 00:06:37.117\nCuz if you guys have been\nwatching the office shows,\n\n141\n00:06:37.117 --> 00:06:41.725\nyou know I'm a Mac computer person and\nI have a Macintosh computer.\n\n142\n00:06:41.725 --> 00:06:46.460\nEven though I'm running Windows, I usually\nrun everything on a virtual machine.\n\n143\n00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.310\nI couldn't get Skype for Business to run\non a virtual machine of Windows because of\n\n144\n00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.570\nthe way of the hardware and\nsoftware, really the hardware.\n\n145\n00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:01.121\nOf how virtual machines use the hardware\non my Macintosh versus this boot\n\n146\n00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:07.240\ncamp that I'm in to really kind of,\nit’s more integrated into the hardware.\n\n147\n00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.030\nAnd that was the way that we could\ngo ahead and film an episode or\n\n148\n00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.295\na whole show on Skype Business for\nPC even though I'm using a Mac.\n\n149\n00:07:16.295 --> 00:07:19.401\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that all has to do\nwith virtualization technology.\n\n150\n00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:21.145\nWe're not gonna worry about that so much,\n\n151\n00:07:21.145 --> 00:07:24.170\nmost of us are probably running\non a regular desktop computer.\n\n152\n00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.710\nBut if you're doing that, you might find\nout that your particular virtualization\n\n153\n00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.560\ntechnology doesn't show up all the device\ndrivers that connects to the hardware.\n\n154\n00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.615\nIt just says, this is close enough and\nSkype for Business may not like the idea\n\n155\n00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:41.195\nof close enough and that's probably the\nissues that we may be facing with that.\n\n156\n00:07:41.195 --> 00:07:43.755\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and again,\nthis is more a me thing.\n\n157\n00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:45.025\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Again, it's all about me,\n\n158\n00:07:45.025 --> 00:07:48.665\nit's all about you, it's all about all of\nus cuz it's going to be very different.\n\n159\n00:07:48.665 --> 00:07:54.310\nSo what speakers am I using for here and\nthe nice thing is like I can test it.\n\n160\n00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.630\nI can go ahead and play.\n\n161\n00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.485\nIt says working and it's actually not, so.\n\n162\n00:07:58.485 --> 00:08:01.751\n&gt;&gt; Well, you need to pick the right,\nyeah, pick the other one, see.\n\n163\n00:08:01.751 --> 00:08:02.554\nThere you go.\n\n164\n00:08:02.554 --> 00:08:03.132\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n165\n00:08:03.132 --> 00:08:06.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Yeah, so you can hear it.\n\n166\n00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.384\nI'm actually doing a test run [LAUGH].\n\n167\n00:08:07.384 --> 00:08:11.600\n&gt;&gt; The face that you made when\nyou were doing that was amazing.\n\n168\n00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.370\nI was like, gosh, look at her.\n\n169\n00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.295\nShe's like, I'm listening,\nI'm really listening.\n\n170\n00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:19.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, because I actually\nthought it was the other one that was,\n\n171\n00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.070\nno I had to make sure to come in.\n\n172\n00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.160\nAnd talk about some scenarios\nof why you wanna come into here,\n\n173\n00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.746\nWhen I was testing with Marisha that\nyou'll be seeing throughout this show.\n\n174\n00:08:28.746 --> 00:08:30.188\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n175\n00:08:30.188 --> 00:08:33.030\nWe tried all these different calls and\nsaid, no, everything's fine,\n\n176\n00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.030\neverything's fine.\n\n177\n00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.720\nKim hit the note,\nshe had the wrong speakers.\n\n178\n00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So that's when she wouldn't hear me and\n\n179\n00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.640\nI was like.\n\n180\n00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.470\nShe's like okay, and\neverything's fine now.\n\n181\n00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.530\nSo test this.\n\n182\n00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.583\nMake sure that [NOISE] Yeah,\nI can hear that noise.\n\n183\n00:08:45.583 --> 00:08:47.455\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Coming out of the speakers and\n\n184\n00:08:47.455 --> 00:08:48.975\nI had to pick, okay, stop.\n\n185\n00:08:48.975 --> 00:08:52.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, it'll go away in a minute.\n\n186\n00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:56.283\nSo I had to pick the right speakers\nthat I need to use in Skype.\n\n187\n00:08:56.283 --> 00:09:00.074\nYou've probably been seeing right now,\nthis microphone,\n\n188\n00:09:00.074 --> 00:09:01.870\nit is detecting right here.\n\n189\n00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.995\nSo my internal,\nit's the only microphone I have too.\n\n190\n00:09:04.995 --> 00:09:06.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n191\n00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.160\nif you don't see that bar going,\nthen something's not working.\n\n192\n00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.670\n&gt;&gt; Right, because it's actually\nregistering what it's picking up through\n\n193\n00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.160\nthe microphone itself.\n\n194\n00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.710\nSo if it's not moving as you're talking,\n\n195\n00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.250\nas you're seeing right here on the screen,\nit probably means\n\n196\n00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.920\nit's not really connected to what\nyou think it's connected to.\n\n197\n00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.579\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So if you have a different option,\n\n198\n00:09:22.579 --> 00:09:25.870\nchoose the other option, and\ncontinue to talk and see what happens.\n\n199\n00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nin that whole my setup with my Mac, and\n\n200\n00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.470\nwe have to do a PC show and [SOUND].\n\n201\n00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:35.392\nThere was even the option of okay,\nlet's go ahead and get another webcam,\n\n202\n00:09:35.392 --> 00:09:36.860\nlike an external webcam.\n\n203\n00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.630\nThat had a microphone and camera and\nplug that in and of course,\n\n204\n00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.170\nthen I have a USB and Mac [LAUGH].\n\n205\n00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:48.740\nSo I mean you could have,\nif it's not like the built in Internal\n\n206\n00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.910\nlaptop, microphone and webcam.\n\n207\n00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:55.760\nYou might need to go ahead and\nget an external one, okay?\n\n208\n00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.150\nSo test that out, you can buy them\nall over the place and they're,\n\n209\n00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.129\nyou can buy a pretty decent one for cheap.\n\n210\n00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.750\nThere are all sorts of brands names,\nbut within $30, I think,\n\n211\n00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.520\nyou can get a decent\nhigh definition camera.\n\n212\n00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.261\n&gt;&gt; I would assume so, I don't really know,\nto tell you the truth.\n\n213\n00:10:12.261 --> 00:10:15.590\n&gt;&gt; It's been so long since I've had\nto do that, its all disintegrated.\n\n214\n00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.330\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\nI don't really pick another one up.\n\n215\n00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.920\nBut if you were doing something that need\nhigh def, just pick out a high def one and\n\n216\n00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.220\nmake sure you know it's what you\nbelieve the video quality should be.\n\n217\n00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.530\nSo that's pretty much the key is\ngetting all that stuff set up.\n\n218\n00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.560\nMake sure the microphone\ndoes what you want and\n\n219\n00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.720\nthen this gives you that\nability to test out.\n\n220\n00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.530\nBoth the speaker,\nas well as the microphone\n\n221\n00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.425\nto ensure that we get the quality that\nwe need and that we want to come across.\n\n222\n00:10:39.425 --> 00:10:42.675\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nnow I've got my audio device.\n\n223\n00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:45.185\nOkay, and this is gonna be the scary\none cuz we're gonna switch over\n\n224\n00:10:45.185 --> 00:10:45.875\nto video [LAUGH].\n\n225\n00:10:45.875 --> 00:10:47.627\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Scary, meaning the angle of which\n\n226\n00:10:47.627 --> 00:10:48.154\nwe are at.\n\n227\n00:10:48.154 --> 00:10:50.015\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; You always want to come from above,\n\n228\n00:10:50.015 --> 00:10:51.770\nyou don't want to go from underneath.\n\n229\n00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.350\n[LAUGH] So you can see that,\nI'm gonna go ahead and look down Down, so\n\n230\n00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:55.850\nI don't get some weird shadowings-\n&gt;&gt; No, yeah.\n\n231\n00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:56.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] In here.\n\n232\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.630\nSo you can see that, yep,\nit's detecting my webcam.\n\n233\n00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.300\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n234\n00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.710\n&gt;&gt; I can also see the little green light.\n\n235\n00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:02.460\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n236\n00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.710\n&gt;&gt; On my laptops, so\nI know that we're good.\n\n237\n00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:07.870\nIt is centering and\ncropping my video in meetings.\n\n238\n00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.070\nThat's always a good setting-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n239\n00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.420\n&gt;&gt; To go ahead and have.\n\n240\n00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:15.370\nWe can go into our camera settings and\ngo ahead and adjust that if you want to.\n\n241\n00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.250\nThe different camera control.\n\n242\n00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.722\nMine doesn't actually have any of\nthem cuz I don't think my device\n\n243\n00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:22.404\nactually will allow, will it?\n\n244\n00:11:22.404 --> 00:11:23.370\n&gt;&gt; Not right now [LAUGH].\n\n245\n00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:27.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I feel like I've had a back\nwhen I working at the University.\n\n246\n00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:31.040\nI had an external webcam that\nI attached to my computer, and\n\n247\n00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.340\nI could do some camera control.\n\n248\n00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.760\nBut with my laptop one,\nit's not letting me do that so.\n\n249\n00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.882\nEven though we go into the different\nproperties if you really want to do some\n\n250\n00:11:40.882 --> 00:11:42.790\ncool white balancing and\nall the one concept.\n\n251\n00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:43.500\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n252\n00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.879\n&gt;&gt; Taylor would be a good\none with that because.\n\n253\n00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:46.207\n&gt;&gt; White balance that's right.\n\n254\n00:11:46.207 --> 00:11:49.313\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so\nwe know a little bit about lighting here.\n\n255\n00:11:49.313 --> 00:11:52.040\nI don't [LAUGH], I defer to them [LAUGH].\n\n256\n00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.900\n&gt;&gt; I just know it's bright is all I know.\n\n257\n00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.110\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty bright in here but\nwe look good.\n\n258\n00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:59.320\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n259\n00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.045\nclick okay because I am kinda scared of\nlooking at myself in multiple places.\n\n260\n00:12:03.045 --> 00:12:05.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you can see that's where I can go\n\n261\n00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:11.000\nahead and in Skype look at my audio and\nmy video settings.\n\n262\n00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.510\nLike I said doesn't mean\nit's still gonna work so\n\n263\n00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:19.650\nwe're gonna take a little trip\ninto our operating system.\n\n264\n00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.360\nAnd look at some of, like,\nwhere our devices are.\n\n265\n00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.200\nNow I'll start because this is where I'm\ngoing to need your help a little bit\n\n266\n00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:26.700\nthere Ronnie.\n\n267\n00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sure.\n\n268\n00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.760\n&gt;&gt; Before we started this episode,\nI couldn't get my sound to work.\n\n269\n00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.660\nLike, on the computer.\n\n270\n00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.330\nAnd this is my way of testing.\n\n271\n00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.980\nI go out to YouTube And,\ncan I hear a funny cats video?\n\n272\n00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.350\nCan I actually hear the audio from it?\n\n273\n00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:46.230\nBecause, if I can hear that, I know\nsomething in the computer was working.\n\n274\n00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.050\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n275\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:47.595\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't.\n\n276\n00:12:47.595 --> 00:12:48.730\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n277\n00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:49.940\n&gt;&gt; So I was like,\n\n278\n00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.640\n&gt;&gt; The movements I do now, I went to here.\n\n279\n00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.380\nSo let's come down into, and we're\nactually gonna have to go behind my head.\n\n280\n00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.130\nCuz we're gonna go into\nthe notification area,\n\n281\n00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.120\ncuz this is the way I\nknow how to get to it.\n\n282\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.190\nRight down here, cuz I know that this\nis where I can adjust my volume, okay.\n\n283\n00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.790\nI know that I can go to my speakers and I\ngo ahead and change the volume into there.\n\n284\n00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.737\nBut, and a lot of times [SOUND], see,\n\n285\n00:13:10.737 --> 00:13:14.844\nI'm just clicking that and\nI could hear the [SOUND].\n\n286\n00:13:14.844 --> 00:13:17.110\nSo, before, it wasn't doing this.\n\n287\n00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:18.980\nI'm like, there's an issue.\n\n288\n00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.950\nIf you right click on the speakers icon,\nif you right click on there\n\n289\n00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:29.310\nI can get into this, the troubleshooting\nor troubleshoot sound problems.\n\n290\n00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.600\nI did this, And it worked.\n\n291\n00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.550\nI'm serious, it actually worked.\n\n292\n00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:36.200\nSo sometimes you get into these and\nyou're like that didn't help at all.\n\n293\n00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.540\nNotice it can see where I am.\n\n294\n00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.790\nThere's my headphones again.\n\n295\n00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.540\nYou can say which of these devices\ndo you want to troubleshoot.\n\n296\n00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.640\nAnd then I click next and\nthen it would go out and\n\n297\n00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:50.380\ndetect, now yeah this whole like audio\nenhancement thing I just went to no\n\n298\n00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.560\nbecause I don't need it to go all\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n299\n00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.350\n&gt;&gt; Crazy right?\n\n300\n00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:53.810\nI mean do you, I mean what is this?\n\n301\n00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:54.440\n&gt;&gt; You can right?\n\n302\n00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.780\nThe idea of the audio\nenhancement is fairly simple.\n\n303\n00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.010\nYou wanna add some other tonal\nqualities to your voice.\n\n304\n00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.460\nIt doesn't give you reverb.\n\n305\n00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.690\nDon't go that far.\n\n306\n00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.750\nYou're not gonna be with\nJustin Timberlake on stage.\n\n307\n00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:12.000\nSinging the backup with reverb, but it\nwill adjust some of the quality tones in\n\n308\n00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.880\nthere for you,\neven set like an equalizer if you need to.\n\n309\n00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.430\n&gt;&gt; He doesn't need any reverb.\n\n310\n00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:18.226\nHis voice is beautiful just the way it is.\n\n311\n00:14:18.226 --> 00:14:19.179\n&gt;&gt; Aw,isn't that sweet?\n\n312\n00:14:19.179 --> 00:14:22.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, I'm going to go ahead and\nsay no to the audio enhancements and\n\n313\n00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.400\nthen it goes ahead\n&gt;&gt; And it might go ahead and\n\n314\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.880\nsay that there wasn't any problem.\n\n315\n00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.150\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because it was, I've already fixed it.\n\n316\n00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But it\n\n317\n00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.035\nlooks like maybe it is\nresolving a problem right now.\n\n318\n00:14:33.035 --> 00:14:34.840\n[LAUGH] Ok, and\n\n319\n00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.500\nI did get this, where it says like\nyour windows, you do need to restart.\n\n320\n00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.640\nSo I restarted and everything was fine.\n\n321\n00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.290\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n322\n00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.580\nI know that that was some way that\nI went ahead and fixed everything.\n\n323\n00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.890\nI'm going to cancel this because\n&amp;nbsp;That's where I got to,\n\n324\n00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.100\nI did everything in it and I could\nactually trouble shoot this on my own,\n\n325\n00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.690\nI was excited, but I did that.\n\n326\n00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:58.670\nBut now, I know that there is a lot\nof different places we can go and\n\n327\n00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.000\nwe're not gonna get too techy.\n\n328\n00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.520\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n329\n00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:05.390\n&gt;&gt; But techy enough to where you could\nhopefully trouble shoot this on your own.\n\n330\n00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:10.350\nSo I know that we can go into\nthe Control Panel and go under the Sounds.\n\n331\n00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:11.740\nSo how do I get there?\n\n332\n00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.540\nI go to the Search and\nI'm just gonna start with Control Panel.\n\n333\n00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:19.320\nNow you could go in and\ntype in sound, but to me,\n\n334\n00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.590\nI feel like it takes you too far down,\nright?\n\n335\n00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.600\nSo I wanna try to keep you top down.\n\n336\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.160\nSo let's go to the control panel,\nit brings up this.\n\n337\n00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.054\nNow from here it's this one, right Ronnie?\n\n338\n00:15:32.054 --> 00:15:33.920\n&gt;&gt; It is hardware and sound, good job.\n\n339\n00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.950\n&gt;&gt; This is where I'm going\nto default to Ronnie,\n\n340\n00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.255\nlike hey take Take me\nwhere I need to go there.\n\n341\n00:15:38.255 --> 00:15:44.135\nSo hardware and sound and then from here,\nyou could see that I've got the sound.\n\n342\n00:15:44.135 --> 00:15:49.855\nAnd I've got the adjust system volume,\nsystem sounds, manage audio devices.\n\n343\n00:15:49.855 --> 00:15:54.741\nAnd I think the actual word sound\ntakes you to a place, which I always\n\n344\n00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:58.108\nthink they're just headings-\n&gt;&gt; Right but they are.\n\n345\n00:15:58.108 --> 00:16:00.683\n&gt;&gt; And they're not clickable places to go.\n\n346\n00:16:00.683 --> 00:16:04.912\nSo if I go here All right so\nnow, in this place Ronny.\n\n347\n00:16:04.912 --> 00:16:08.577\nI'm at my playback this is the,\nthe AGA, that's what we actually have.\n\n348\n00:16:08.577 --> 00:16:10.400\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Connected here.\n\n349\n00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.327\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Of what you guys see, you can't see,\n\n350\n00:16:12.327 --> 00:16:16.082\nbut there's a little plug of where you\nguys see my computer on the screen, so\n\n351\n00:16:16.082 --> 00:16:17.355\nthat's why I have this.\n\n352\n00:16:17.355 --> 00:16:18.026\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n353\n00:16:18.026 --> 00:16:19.625\n&gt;&gt; All right where am I going next?\n\n354\n00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:22.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Depending on what we need to test and\n\n355\n00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.279\nverify right?\n\n356\n00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:26.990\nSo if I just go ahead and\nselect the one that is active right now.\n\n357\n00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.765\n&gt;&gt; This one?\n&gt;&gt; All those other ones that you see with\n\n358\n00:16:28.765 --> 00:16:31.908\nthe red down arrow, if I'm, yeah\n[LAUGH] I have to be able to see them.\n\n359\n00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:34.899\nThe red down arrow means that you might\nhave plugged these in at some point but,\n\n360\n00:16:34.899 --> 00:16:36.640\nthey're not plugged in right now.\n\n361\n00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.988\nSo set up everything and\ngot it ready to go.\n\n362\n00:16:38.988 --> 00:16:40.604\nBut notice that once you click on it,\n\n363\n00:16:40.604 --> 00:16:42.489\nclick back off on one\nof the red ones there.\n\n364\n00:16:42.489 --> 00:16:46.176\nNotice that those buttons down across the\nbottom of the screen they've greyed out.\n\n365\n00:16:46.176 --> 00:16:48.245\nIf you want to check out\nsome settings on sounds,\n\n366\n00:16:48.245 --> 00:16:50.440\nselect the active one that you have there.\n\n367\n00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.590\nAnd then you can select\nconfigure at this point.\n\n368\n00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:57.570\nAnd now you can go in and test some\nsound settings if you're doing this.\n\n369\n00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.862\nNow this is really designed around\nthe older media center editions of\n\n370\n00:17:01.862 --> 00:17:04.090\nWindows that used to come out.\n\n371\n00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.430\nBecause it will even do like mine.\n\n372\n00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:07.750\nDoes yours say surround sound?\n\n373\n00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:08.250\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n374\n00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:08.808\n&gt;&gt; It does say.\n\n375\n00:17:08.808 --> 00:17:09.320\nOkay.\n\n376\n00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:09.935\nI can't see it.\n\n377\n00:17:09.935 --> 00:17:11.423\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I was looking at my screen, like,\n\n378\n00:17:11.423 --> 00:17:13.610\nhopefully it says surround\nup there somewhere.\n\n379\n00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:15.399\nBut if you had surround sound speakers,\n\n380\n00:17:15.399 --> 00:17:18.405\nyou could actually get this to test\nit all out and do what you want to.\n\n381\n00:17:18.405 --> 00:17:21.882\nBut for us, if we're just trying\nto do something like headphones,\n\n382\n00:17:21.882 --> 00:17:25.003\nstereo is probably it, go ahead and\nselect the test button.\n\n383\n00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:28.980\nAnd then you can see, it's not playing\nbecause her's is playing over that AJA and\n\n384\n00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.410\nsaying, I don't know what that is for\nright now.\n\n385\n00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.607\nBut, that's what you're\nactually able to see.\n\n386\n00:17:32.607 --> 00:17:34.401\nAnd you should hear it if you\nare sitting in the middle,\n\n387\n00:17:34.401 --> 00:17:36.281\nlike what you are seeing over\nhere on the right hand side.\n\n388\n00:17:36.281 --> 00:17:38.666\nIs that you should hear one\nfrom the left hand side,\n\n389\n00:17:38.666 --> 00:17:40.607\nyou should hear it from\nright hand side and\n\n390\n00:17:40.607 --> 00:17:44.235\nfrom that point now you can actually click\non the next part of it if you want to.\n\n391\n00:17:44.235 --> 00:17:49.101\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and when we did this on my\nlaptop back at the desk, it worked fine.\n\n392\n00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:50.375\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But like you said,\n\n393\n00:17:50.375 --> 00:17:52.070\nbecause the way that we are plugged in.\n\n394\n00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.158\n&gt;&gt; Connected, yeah.\n\n395\n00:17:53.158 --> 00:17:54.071\n&gt;&gt; And so you can see everything.\n\n396\n00:17:54.071 --> 00:17:57.950\nSo if I go to next and then it just talks\nabout some different options that we\n\n397\n00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.588\nhave with our speakers,\nsatellite speakers?\n\n398\n00:18:00.588 --> 00:18:01.145\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n399\n00:18:01.145 --> 00:18:04.390\nif you have satellite speakers,\nwhatever else the issues are, right?\n\n400\n00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:08.420\nAnd you're setting this up to make sure\nthis is gonna guarantee that the computer\n\n401\n00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.560\nessentially can play the sounds\nthat you're desiring for it to do.\n\n402\n00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.880\nAnd that's why you would go through here.\n\n403\n00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.950\nSo what Vonne showed you is a little\nbit more specific in that way.\n\n404\n00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.810\nIf you really wanted to try and\n\n405\n00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:23.460\nmake everything as easy as possible, you\nadd in whatever speakers that you have,\n\n406\n00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.000\nand you verify that the machine\ncan then go through it.\n\n407\n00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.035\nAnd then you can go into Skype for\nbusiness and verify that that sees it.\n\n408\n00:18:29.035 --> 00:18:32.960\nAnd that's stepping your way through and\ngoing alright, now that the computer can\n\n409\n00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.450\nsee it, now my application can see it,\nSkype for business can see it.\n\n410\n00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.679\nI should be good in terms of sound, okay?\n\n411\n00:18:38.679 --> 00:18:40.904\nSo, once we select that, okay?\n\n412\n00:18:40.904 --> 00:18:44.519\nAnd she's actually popped back out,\nnotice that there's a next tab there and\n\n413\n00:18:44.519 --> 00:18:46.520\nthat it actually says record.\n\n414\n00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.338\nOnce again, you see right there on,\nactually on hers,\n\n415\n00:18:49.338 --> 00:18:52.337\nit doesn't have any particular\ndevices that are there, okay?\n\n416\n00:18:52.337 --> 00:18:55.835\nBut you had that one actually up and\nrunning,\n\n417\n00:18:55.835 --> 00:19:00.902\nyou would actually see a little\ngreen sound meter over on the right\n\n418\n00:19:00.902 --> 00:19:05.430\nhand side that would be popping back and\nforth up and down.\n\n419\n00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.070\n&gt;&gt; Like the microphone that we had in the\nSkype for business setting, of where it\n\n420\n00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:12.665\nwas actually showing the bar of when I\nwas talking and it was detecting that.\n\n421\n00:19:12.665 --> 00:19:13.570\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n422\n00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.830\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of interesting\nthat it's not showing up here.\n\n423\n00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI'm not exactly sure why hers is not\n\n424\n00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:22.910\nshowing up right there but, some of\nit may be that Windows is not really\n\n425\n00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:26.290\nrecognizing the Boot Camp drivers, but\nI'm not exactly sure on that one either.\n\n426\n00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.930\n&gt;&gt; And it could be the AGA thing.\n\n427\n00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.200\nBecause I know we went\nthrough all of this, because.\n\n428\n00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:30.907\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We like to prep.\n\n429\n00:19:30.907 --> 00:19:32.364\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And we went through and\n\n430\n00:19:32.364 --> 00:19:34.185\nI'm like, yeah, that's all of that.\n\n431\n00:19:34.185 --> 00:19:38.161\nSo I'm gonna maybe throw in because of the\nway that we're recording this episode and\n\n432\n00:19:38.161 --> 00:19:40.345\nyou're recording my screen and everything,\n\n433\n00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:42.480\nthat that might have\nsomething to do with it.\n\n434\n00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.104\nBut again, we're really just trying to\njust give you a little bit more background\n\n435\n00:19:47.104 --> 00:19:50.723\ninto where you can go,\nto try to troubleshoot your audio and, or\n\n436\n00:19:50.723 --> 00:19:54.358\nyou're video settings within\nyour computer, not just Skype.\n\n437\n00:19:54.358 --> 00:19:58.840\nSo, just where we're taking you\nis kinda the most important part.\n\n438\n00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.413\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And some of the buttons that you're\n\n439\n00:20:00.413 --> 00:20:03.150\ngoing to be able to see,\nyour settings on your computer.\n\n440\n00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:04.300\n&gt;&gt; Right and it really is neat.\n\n441\n00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:08.200\nIt's more detailed than what we're\nseeing right here which is fine because\n\n442\n00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.390\nyou'll see that there are a lot of things\nthat if you didn't just select configure\n\n443\n00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:12.715\nlike we did on the first.\n\n444\n00:20:12.715 --> 00:20:14.756\nIf we go back to playback for a moment?\n\n445\n00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:17.324\nAnd select the properties over\non the right hand corner,\n\n446\n00:20:17.324 --> 00:20:20.010\nyou'll see that there's maybe,\nyeah, other settings.\n\n447\n00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:24.220\nNow hers, let's see, it actually just\nshows some generic properties, and\n\n448\n00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.760\nthat's because it's actually\njust connected to that AJ.\n\n449\n00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.830\nBut nine, that's connected\nright to the machine itself.\n\n450\n00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.560\nIt shows where I can change the levels,\nand that the speakers are coming out.\n\n451\n00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.340\nIt's giving me advanced sound quality,\n\n452\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.080\nspatial sound,\nyou name it there's some other things.\n\n453\n00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.530\nMost of us are probably not gonna need all\nthat inside of Skype for business, but\n\n454\n00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.140\njust realize that there are other\nconfigurations that are out there.\n\n455\n00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.056\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you really just want\nthe speakers and the audio to work.\n\n456\n00:20:48.056 --> 00:20:49.987\n&gt;&gt; Pretty much.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're not really caring\n\n457\n00:20:49.987 --> 00:20:52.777\nabout the surround sound and\nall the things that Tim has in\n\n458\n00:20:52.777 --> 00:20:56.284\nhis office with the Sonos speakers and\nall those crazy things so [LAUGH].\n\n459\n00:20:56.284 --> 00:20:58.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo it is a lot that's right here for\n\n460\n00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.980\nyou to test out.\n\n461\n00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.930\nAnd then the last one there right?\n\n462\n00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.900\nIs that communications tab.\n\n463\n00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.380\nNow the sounds tab,\n\n464\n00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.790\nI'm skipping on that because that's\nactually just kind of the Windows sounds\n\n465\n00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:13.460\nthat are available the dings that you\nhear, the little chime and stuff.\n\n466\n00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.390\nSo if you wanna change that,\nyou can change that there but\n\n467\n00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:19.750\nunder communications, it says Windows\ncan automatically adjust the volume of\n\n468\n00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:25.150\ndifferent sounds when you're using the PC\nto place or receive telephone calls.\n\n469\n00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:29.220\nNow, that might actually be interesting,\nespecially for Skype for Business\n\n470\n00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:33.990\nbecause ultimately Skype for Business\ncan be used in a telephonic situation.\n\n471\n00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:37.240\nSo in that one, you might actually\nwant to pick one of these.\n\n472\n00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.340\nAnd if you take a look at that, right?\n\n473\n00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.570\nYou can mute all the other\nsounds in the background but\n\n474\n00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:45.600\nthe actual telephone call itself,\nthat's kind of a neat thing.\n\n475\n00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.320\nThat will reduce all that\nbackground noise for you.\n\n476\n00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.820\nYou can reduce the volume\nof other sounds by 80% that\n\n477\n00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.990\nmight be better where it\nstill sounds natural.\n\n478\n00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.452\nBecause if you mute all the other\nsounds somebody's probably saying\n\n479\n00:21:56.452 --> 00:21:59.750\nyou're recording me Vonne for a reason,\nand I don't know what's going on.\n\n480\n00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.060\nBut I hear nothing else\nthat's happening there.\n\n481\n00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:05.260\nAnd then reduce it by 50 sounds or\ndo nothing at all and\n\n482\n00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.060\nleaves it at the natural environment.\n\n483\n00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:11.240\nSo you can see, whereas in an office\nsetting where you might be with cubicles,\n\n484\n00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.560\nreducing some of these\nsounds may actually help.\n\n485\n00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.920\nAnd this is gonna have it\ndone at the computer level\n\n486\n00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.990\nbefore it sends it into Skype for\nBusiness.\n\n487\n00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.620\nSo that may actually influence the way\nthat it gets into Skype for Business.\n\n488\n00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.650\nNow there are some settings\nhere that we can adjust and\n\n489\n00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.370\nright here on the audio\nsetting it's pretty hefty.\n\n490\n00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:31.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I honestly didn't know\nabout the communication setting, so\n\n491\n00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.790\nthat's pretty cool.\n\n492\n00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.410\nI'm glad we went over that.\n\n493\n00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:35.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n494\n00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.440\n&gt;&gt; So I was going over our sound and\nis there anything\n\n495\n00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:43.020\nin our control panel that we should worry\nabout when we're talking about our video?\n\n496\n00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.380\nIs that something that we\ncan come into here and\n\n497\n00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.950\ndo the same type of like properties and\nconfigurations?\n\n498\n00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:49.890\n&gt;&gt; To a point, right?\n\n499\n00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:55.140\nSo it really does depend on your\nparticular video device itself.\n\n500\n00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.534\nIf there are additional drivers\nthat Windows will recognize,\n\n501\n00:22:58.534 --> 00:23:02.322\nthen it will probably say something\nlike this which is kinda strange.\n\n502\n00:23:02.322 --> 00:23:05.300\nIt's saying,\nwe don't have a generic video testing.\n\n503\n00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:09.026\nBut what it will normally do is say,\nif you've installed those video drivers,\n\n504\n00:23:09.026 --> 00:23:13.030\ngo to those video drivers and they'll have\nsomething similar to what we saw in sound,\n\n505\n00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:13.778\nbut for video.\n\n506\n00:23:13.778 --> 00:23:17.040\nAnd normally it'll allow you to\nchange things like resolution\n\n507\n00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.770\nthat you want to see, it will allow you to\ndo that enhancement stuff that we talked\n\n508\n00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:24.850\nabout in terms of the brightness and\nthe hue and all of that stuff.\n\n509\n00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:26.650\nAnd some of the funny\nones that are out there,\n\n510\n00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:31.270\nof course, will even be more like where\nthey put a funny hat on you as you look.\n\n511\n00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:32.945\nSo my daughter showed me this on Snap.\n\n512\n00:23:32.945 --> 00:23:33.530\nSnap.\n\n513\n00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:34.300\n&gt;&gt; Snapchat?\n[LAUGH]\n\n514\n00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.840\n&gt;&gt; I don't do these kind of things.\n\n515\n00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You don't snap, Ron?\n\n516\n00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.810\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't snap.\n\n517\n00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:41.425\n&gt;&gt; I don't either.\n\n518\n00:23:41.425 --> 00:23:43.536\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But where she's like look at this and\n\n519\n00:23:43.536 --> 00:23:47.566\na funny hat and a face and my eyebrows\nappeared different and everything,\n\n520\n00:23:47.566 --> 00:23:51.336\nso even that actually appeared\ndifferent before Snapchat came out,\n\n521\n00:23:51.336 --> 00:23:53.556\nI remember that kind of stuff like that.\n\n522\n00:23:53.556 --> 00:23:58.844\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's in the drivers of\nthe video of whatever webcam or device.\n\n523\n00:23:58.844 --> 00:23:59.383\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n524\n00:23:59.383 --> 00:23:59.911\n&gt;&gt; You have, so.\n\n525\n00:23:59.911 --> 00:24:01.679\nAnd that gets into one-\n&gt;&gt; Additional software, yeah.\n\n526\n00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:04.550\n&gt;&gt; I know when we start talking\nabout drivers that starts to,\n\n527\n00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.260\nI feel like it's on a scary place.\n\n528\n00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.367\nCuz it's like you don't have the right\ndriver, you have to go out and\n\n529\n00:24:09.367 --> 00:24:12.196\ndownload it and find it and\nit's [SOUND], it can get a little scary.\n\n530\n00:24:12.196 --> 00:24:14.614\n&gt;&gt; It can be, but\nmost of the ones today, right,\n\n531\n00:24:14.614 --> 00:24:16.860\nthey're what we call universal drivers.\n\n532\n00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:20.200\nIn other words, if you picked a particular\ncompany and you go and download\n\n533\n00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.990\nthe drivers, most of the ones that they'll\nsell to you are relatively generic.\n\n534\n00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:29.650\nSo they've tried to do that,\nthey tried to make a universal driver, and\n\n535\n00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:30.600\nthat makes it easy.\n\n536\n00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.300\nBecause they're saying, look,\nit doesn't matter what camera you have,\n\n537\n00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.700\nour drivers are gonna work with it,\nor this driver is gonna work with it.\n\n538\n00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.910\nAnd that should actually get\nyou started much easier.\n\n539\n00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.490\n&gt;&gt; I feel like it has gotten\neasier over the years.\n\n540\n00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:44.000\nI mean, there's still those pitfalls and\n\n541\n00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.200\nthere's still some things that\nget us into little weird places.\n\n542\n00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.330\nBut overall it seems to be better.\n\n543\n00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:51.511\nSo if I were to look up like\nthose drivers of my device,\n\n544\n00:24:51.511 --> 00:24:53.725\nisn't there like a Device Manager?\n\n545\n00:24:53.725 --> 00:24:55.390\nAm I remembering this correctly?\n\n546\n00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:56.230\n&gt;&gt; You are correct.\n\n547\n00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:59.820\nThere is a Device Manager that\nyou can access if you're actually\n\n548\n00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.050\nwilling to do this.\n\n549\n00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:02.810\nSo you have to actually\nfigure out whether or\n\n550\n00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:06.530\nnot your device actually is\ngonna show up inside of Windows.\n\n551\n00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:07.916\nAnd here, let's see, can you find it?\n\n552\n00:25:07.916 --> 00:25:11.616\nYeah, there it is,\nat the top, Device Manager.\n\n553\n00:25:11.616 --> 00:25:14.856\n&gt;&gt; And that search up here at the top,\nthat's a great way to find things.\n\n554\n00:25:14.856 --> 00:25:15.520\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n555\n00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.240\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember how to get to all\nthese different configurations in\n\n556\n00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.450\nthe Control Panel.\n\n557\n00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:21.917\nI mean, luckily I work with all these\ntechie guys here so it's really great.\n\n558\n00:25:21.917 --> 00:25:23.907\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I use that search and\n\n559\n00:25:23.907 --> 00:25:27.780\nI can find out, yeah, this looks familiar.\n\n560\n00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.810\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne,\nif you've tried everything, right?\n\n561\n00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:33.226\nIf everything else has been done for,\nyou can go, crud, it's still not working,\n\n562\n00:25:33.226 --> 00:25:37.690\nmore than likely, right,\nverify that the computer sees it.\n\n563\n00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:41.480\nAnd if you go into Device Manager go about\nthe fifth or sixth from the bottom and\n\n564\n00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.430\ntake a look and\nyou'll see one that says Sound,\n\n565\n00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.680\nvideo, there it is, and game controllers.\n\n566\n00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.740\nWe select that and\nit's right there underneath that.\n\n567\n00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.666\nIf a video driver shows up\nit should be right there.\n\n568\n00:25:51.666 --> 00:25:53.834\nAnd you might see where\nit says video codec or\n\n569\n00:25:53.834 --> 00:25:56.030\nyou might see something like that.\n\n570\n00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:59.100\nBut all you have to do,\ndouble click on that one for us.\n\n571\n00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.940\nAnd it's right here, and what you're\nlooking for is under Device status, okay?\n\n572\n00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.940\nInside of that particular\nbox under Device status\n\n573\n00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:09.100\nit should say this device\nis working properly.\n\n574\n00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:13.080\nAnd that means that the operating system\nsays yes this device should work.\n\n575\n00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:17.510\nAnd if you can get that particular\npoint right where you can do that,\n\n576\n00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:18.440\nthen you're up and good.\n\n577\n00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.677\nBut if you see that and\nit goes there's an error here,\n\n578\n00:26:20.677 --> 00:26:22.984\nthat means you probably\ndownloaded the wrong driver.\n\n579\n00:26:22.984 --> 00:26:26.380\n&gt;&gt; And this is usually the point where\nyou're probably calling tech support.\n\n580\n00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.695\nYou're calling the help desk.\n\n581\n00:26:27.695 --> 00:26:29.857\nBut at least when they say\ngo to the Device Manager,\n\n582\n00:26:29.857 --> 00:26:31.010\nwe've shown you where it is.\n\n583\n00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:36.073\nAnd I know this Driver tab right here, if\nthere is like an update that might need to\n\n584\n00:26:36.073 --> 00:26:41.211\ndo, I mean, this is sometimes where\nthey'll tell you update your drivers,\n\n585\n00:26:41.211 --> 00:26:43.680\nand sometimes you can fix it from here.\n\n586\n00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthis one actually depends on whether or\n\n587\n00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:48.100\nnot Microsoft has kept it updated.\n\n588\n00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.650\nNow, they're probably doing a lot\nbetter than they used to do.\n\n589\n00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.490\nSometimes you click on, it doesn't do\nanything, but then you go up to their\n\n590\n00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.880\nwebsite and there's plenty of drivers\navailable for you to download.\n\n591\n00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.840\nSo it just depends on the way\nthat they have the drivers.\n\n592\n00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.590\nAnd the the reason why they're\ngetting better at it is\n\n593\n00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:01.980\nthey're doing better at\nthe driver management.\n\n594\n00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.660\nThey've changed the way that some\nof this stuff goes out as well.\n\n595\n00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:08.030\nBut you also see where you can\nDisable Device if you're troubleshooting.\n\n596\n00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.440\nAnd you might be wondering, when\nthe heck would I do something like that?\n\n597\n00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:15.800\nLet's say that you added in two or\nthree different video webcams.\n\n598\n00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:21.120\nAnd you're like, well, I think this is\nthe only one I'm having an issue with.\n\n599\n00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:25.238\nWell you might go ahead and just disable\nall those other video cameras that you\n\n600\n00:27:25.238 --> 00:27:28.292\nhave, and that way the machine\nis only focused in on one.\n\n601\n00:27:28.292 --> 00:27:31.632\nAnd then we start troubleshooting\nfrom that point as well.\n\n602\n00:27:31.632 --> 00:27:36.500\nSo there's plenty of different ways that\nwe can dive into it a little bit deeper.\n\n603\n00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.700\nBut that's all up to you and\n\n604\n00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.790\nhow much you really want to jump\nin to the background of this.\n\n605\n00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:43.770\nMost of us are probably just gonna call\ntech support in the background and\n\n606\n00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.934\nsay it's really not working,\ncan you help me out?\n\n607\n00:27:45.934 --> 00:27:47.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And let them deal with it.\n\n608\n00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.817\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but at least we,\nhey, why not try it?\n\n609\n00:27:49.817 --> 00:27:50.420\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n610\n00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:54.590\n&gt;&gt; I mean, sometimes it's like\nwell I think that's gonna happen.\n\n611\n00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.888\nAnd always the good old restart.\n\n612\n00:27:56.888 --> 00:27:59.666\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then just take everything out, and\n\n613\n00:27:59.666 --> 00:28:01.292\nthen unplug it, plug it back in.\n\n614\n00:28:01.292 --> 00:28:04.913\nI mean, that actually just\nhappened to us with our AGA,\n\n615\n00:28:04.913 --> 00:28:09.400\nthe resolution was all weird so\nwe had to unplug it and plug it back in.\n\n616\n00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.510\nAnd hey, guess what?\n&gt;&gt; It worked.\n\n617\n00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:13.030\n&gt;&gt; It was fixed, [LAUGH] so it happens.\n\n618\n00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:17.380\nSo hopefully this is just giving\nyou a little bit of a background in\n\n619\n00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:22.030\nwhere these different devices and\nthe settings are on your computer.\n\n620\n00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:24.264\nWe're in Skype for Business, and\n\n621\n00:28:24.264 --> 00:28:28.434\nusually from right there everything\nshould work out just fine.\n\n622\n00:28:28.434 --> 00:28:31.913\nBut just be prepared,\nit probably won't work.\n\n623\n00:28:31.913 --> 00:28:32.413\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n624\n00:28:32.413 --> 00:28:35.095\n&gt;&gt; At least once in a really important\n\n625\n00:28:35.095 --> 00:28:36.021\nmeeting.\nAnd\n\n626\n00:28:36.021 --> 00:28:37.601\nit's gonna be all weird.\nAnd\n\n627\n00:28:37.601 --> 00:28:41.220\nI cannot tell you how many\ntimes this has happened to me.\n\n628\n00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.840\nBut then I'll have months where\neverything worked beautifully.\n\n629\n00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.903\nI mean, I was conducting all sorts\nof meetings online and I was,\n\n630\n00:28:47.903 --> 00:28:50.304\nonce everything's set,\neverything was great.\n\n631\n00:28:50.304 --> 00:28:52.555\nIt was usually the people on the other\n\n632\n00:28:52.555 --> 00:28:53.059\nend-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n633\n00:28:53.059 --> 00:28:54.540\n&gt;&gt; That had a problem.\n\n634\n00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:55.690\nSo it wasn't me.\n\n635\n00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.640\nIt's not me, it's you, it's you,\nit's not me, all that kinda stuff.\n\n636\n00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:03.840\nBut just be prepared that this is\nan area that can be very frustrating.\n\n637\n00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.350\nAnd sometimes there isn't a clear answer.\n\n638\n00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:11.250\nBut with these tips and tricks hopefully\nyou can at least try to fix it and\n\n639\n00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.138\neverything will work out.\n\n640\n00:29:13.138 --> 00:29:15.270\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne, well thank you\nagain for helping us to set up.\n\n641\n00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:19.300\nAnd at least take a look at the basics\nof troubleshooting of our audio and\n\n642\n00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.580\nvideo devices that we may be\nusing with Skype for Business.\n\n643\n00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:26.169\nSo as we continue to move forward\nthere is of course a lot more for\n\n644\n00:29:26.169 --> 00:29:30.736\nus to think about, but Vonne, any last\nwords before we close out this episode?\n\n645\n00:29:30.736 --> 00:29:31.441\n&gt;&gt; Keep smiling.\n\n646\n00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:32.847\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Keep smiling.\n\n647\n00:29:32.847 --> 00:29:35.322\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And call that tech support and\n\n648\n00:29:35.322 --> 00:29:36.364\njust have them fix it.\n\n649\n00:29:36.364 --> 00:29:38.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, Vonne.\n\n650\n00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.370\nWell thank you again, like we said this is\na great place for us to end this episode.\n\n651\n00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:46.100\nBut, of course, you want to stay around,\ncuz there's more episodes to come for\n\n652\n00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.390\nSkype for Business.\n\n653\n00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:50.255\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n654\n00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:51.906\n&gt;&gt;

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.060\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday you're watching Skype for Business.\n\n4\n00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.750\nWe're gonna be taking a look adding and\norganizing context.\n\n5\n00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.200\nAnd here today with us, of course,\n\n6\n00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.040\nis gonna be our Office Pro guru herself,\nVonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.320\nVonne, welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.450\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me.\n\n9\n00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.050\nIt's great to be here with you.\n\n10\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.640\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne, so\nas we begin to take a look at, of course,\n\n11\n00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.280\nusing Skype for Business.\n\n12\n00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.060\nOne of the essential thing that\nwe have to do of course is\n\n13\n00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.630\nmake sure that we can add contacts in.\n\n14\n00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.990\nBut we may get a little bit confused\nhere Vonne, because I know working with\n\n15\n00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.995\nOutlook, I know what contacts are, but\nthis maybe something different, right?\n\n16\n00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:54.523\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's my favorite saying,\nit's the same but\n\n17\n00:00:54.523 --> 00:00:55.385\ndifferent [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n18\n00:00:55.385 --> 00:00:56.565\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Of course, right?\n\n19\n00:00:56.565 --> 00:01:00.967\nBecause, I mean, we have contacts and I\nfeel like everything in our life nowadays,\n\n20\n00:01:00.967 --> 00:01:03.633\nlike you mentioned the Outlook contacts,\nright?\n\n21\n00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:07.441\nAnd those are people that you\nwant to add that you know and\n\n22\n00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:10.175\nthat you wanna kinda keep track of.\n\n23\n00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:13.545\nBut this doesn't mean you\ncan't email somebody that's\n\n24\n00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:15.730\nnot in your contacts, right?\n\n25\n00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.020\nJust like we have contacts in our cell\nphone, we can make phone calls to other\n\n26\n00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.380\npeople, and people can call us even though\nthey are not part of our contacts, right?\n\n27\n00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.290\nSo, they are separate\nthan Outlook contacts\n\n28\n00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.970\neven though we've talked a lot about how\nOutlook is so integrated with Skype for\n\n29\n00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.770\nBusiness, with our presence and\nExchange and all of that.\n\n30\n00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.160\nI would think,\nthat your contacts in your Outlook\n\n31\n00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.840\nwould just kind of roll on over to\nyour Skype for Business, it doesn't.\n\n32\n00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.070\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH].\n\n33\n00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.360\n&gt;&gt; It's like two different phones,\nif you wanna say.\n\n34\n00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.200\nMaybe just two different types of,\njust a piece of hardware, really.\n\n35\n00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.350\nThey're different applications and\n\n36\n00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.650\nwhile they're married together in the\nsense of all connected to your account.\n\n37\n00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.680\nThey are different, in that sense.\n\n38\n00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.110\nSo, we're gonna talk\nabout adding contacts.\n\n39\n00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.100\nWe'll gonna talk about finding them,\norganizing them,\n\n40\n00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.260\nall those different things, and\nthat's what we're trying to do.\n\n41\n00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.900\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Vonne, when we talk\nabout this idea of finding contacts.\n\n42\n00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.200\nIf I remember right, in Outlook\nnormally if somebody sent me an email,\n\n43\n00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.290\nI wanted to add them into contacts.\n\n44\n00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.060\nThat's that sounds logical, but if I'm\nusing this in Skype for Business and\n\n45\n00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.540\nI don't have any contacts in,\nhow do they know how to find me?\n\n46\n00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.570\nWhat's gonna happen here?\n\n47\n00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthere's a couple different nuances.\n\n48\n00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.200\nAnd especially since we have\nthe Skype right, there's Skype.\n\n49\n00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.200\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We also have Skype for Business, and\n\n50\n00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.740\nhow we know that they're\nvery separate things.\n\n51\n00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.700\nWe also have Link, right?\n\n52\n00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.343\nThe successor or\nthe predecessor to Skype for Business.\n\n53\n00:02:50.343 --> 00:02:52.600\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That some people are still on.\n\n54\n00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.425\nActually, our director right there\ncontrolling our camera right,\n\n55\n00:02:57.425 --> 00:02:58.830\n[LAUGH] is actually part of Link.\n\n56\n00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.950\nThey use Link on their machines\nat their stations, and\n\n57\n00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.880\nthen you have all sorts of\ndifferent settings that everybody's\n\n58\n00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.470\nnetwork can have whether you see them or\nnot.\n\n59\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.400\nSo it's kind of like going\ninto the phone book, right?\n\n60\n00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.730\nWhere you could go in, I remember,\nactually using a phone book,\n\n61\n00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.830\na book, there was a book,\nthe yellow pages, right?\n\n62\n00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.800\nThat you could go and look in the white\npages and that would list everybody.\n\n63\n00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.980\n&gt;&gt; In the yellow pages and\nthe white pages.\n\n64\n00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n65\n00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.500\nBut then you can also\nhave an unlisted number.\n\n66\n00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.310\n&gt;&gt; True.\n&gt;&gt; Right, where nobody could find it in\n\n67\n00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.310\nwhatever directory.\n\n68\n00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.570\nAll the same applies here.\n\n69\n00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.880\nSo I'm glad that you brought that up and\nI do have a website that\n\n70\n00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.330\nhas some references which I think are\npretty good that we are going to review.\n\n71\n00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.891\nSo, why don't we just jump right on\ndown and show you how to find and\n\n72\n00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:51.199\nadd and organize?\n\n73\n00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.757\n&gt;&gt; That was great.\n\n74\n00:03:51.757 --> 00:03:52.650\n&gt;&gt; Yay, so let's jump down in.\n\n75\n00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.640\nYou can see that I have already\nsigned in to my Skype for Business.\n\n76\n00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.900\nI went ahead and\nchanged my note up there, Ronnie.\n\n77\n00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.910\nIt's contact day.\n\n78\n00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.160\n&gt;&gt; Contact day.\n\n79\n00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.800\n&gt;&gt; Yay, so you've got that up there.\n\n80\n00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.430\nSo I've put that in,\nI did refer to that as presence.\n\n81\n00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.340\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it is our presence.\n\n82\n00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.720\nBut our presence is actually\na little bit more than just that.\n\n83\n00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.480\nIt's not just our little catch phrase,\nif you wanna say.\n\n84\n00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.030\nIt is our availability, of where we're at,\n\n85\n00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.710\nall of those different things is really\nencompassing your whole presence.\n\n86\n00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.500\nAnd what people can and cannot see,\n\n87\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.260\nwe are gonna get into that,\nwe talk about our contact cards.\n\n88\n00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.170\nAnd really all throughout these\nepisodes within this contact topic,\n\n89\n00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.100\nwe'll go through it.\n\n90\n00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.690\nSo I wanted to go ahead and change that.\n\n91\n00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.440\nI have my contacts already up, that's\nwhat on by default when you go ahead and\n\n92\n00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.370\nsign in for Skype for Business.\n\n93\n00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.920\nAnd we have these different\ntabs across the bottom.\n\n94\n00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.200\nWe have Group, Status,\nRelationships, and New.\n\n95\n00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.845\nI have some contents I've already added\nthat you can see that we can organize\n\n96\n00:04:54.845 --> 00:04:58.488\ninto groups, which we will\neventually do in this episode.\n\n97\n00:04:58.488 --> 00:05:00.090\nAnd then we have some other ones.\n\n98\n00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.350\nWe will talk about what it means\nto have our different statuses,\n\n99\n00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.160\nour relationships, and then that new,\nbut I'm gonna save that for\n\n100\n00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.560\na little bit later to\ntalk about all of that.\n\n101\n00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.030\nWhat can I do to find someone?\n\n102\n00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.250\nWell, it says it right there,\nFind someone.\n\n103\n00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.940\nSo there we can go ahead and\nstart searching.\n\n104\n00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:28.140\nBut before we do we need to kinda talk\nabout who you can and cannot find.\n\n105\n00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.490\nCuz that's kind of important.\n\n106\n00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.810\nNow, if somebody gives you their name,\nin a sense all their contact information.\n\n107\n00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.128\nHey, go ahead and add me on Skype,\nit's joey@officepro.com.\n\n108\n00:05:40.128 --> 00:05:43.138\nAnd so you would go ahead and\ntype it in and it may or\n\n109\n00:05:43.138 --> 00:05:47.850\nmight not come up when you type this in\nbecause of all the different nuances.\n\n110\n00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.220\nLike I was saying about the Link\nversus Skype, Skype for Business,\n\n111\n00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.330\nmaybe you have Skype for Business, but you\ncan't see things, all that kinda funstuff.\n\n112\n00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.820\nSo finding might not always work.\n\n113\n00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.640\nSo let's go ahead and jump down into that\nwebsite that I wanted to show down here.\n\n114\n00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.310\nIs that it just say like, hey, you could\ngo ahead and type in the person's,\n\n115\n00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.810\nI'm getting that little alert because\nI do have my Outlook connected,\n\n116\n00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.880\njust to let you know.\n\n117\n00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.191\nGuess what, I have appointment says,\n\n118\n00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:17.074\nreview contact with Ronnie\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n119\n00:06:17.074 --> 00:06:19.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm gonna go ahead and\ndismiss that right now.\n\n120\n00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.519\nYes, I don't wanna have\nany of those reminders.\n\n121\n00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.780\nSo when you're going to find this,\nit's going to say where do you want to\n\n122\n00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.935\nsearch for people's names and\ntheir contact information.\n\n123\n00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:36.940\nSo, I'm jumping back and forth\na little bit, but let's find someone.\n\n124\n00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.500\nWe're going to find, you know what,\nwe're gonna find Wes.\n\n125\n00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.730\nHow about that?\n&gt;&gt; Let's find Wes.\n\n126\n00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.290\n&gt;&gt; We will find Wes.\n\n127\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.280\nNow, as soon as I start typing just\nWes by itself nothing's gonna come up.\n\n128\n00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:53.060\nBut you see as soon as I do that it says\nthat, my contacts or Skype directory.\n\n129\n00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.130\nWell, if I look at my contacts,\nthat's not going to work\n\n130\n00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.310\nby any means because Wes is not\npart of our OfficeProDemo.com.\n\n131\n00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.070\nWhile I say that, why don't we do this?\n\n132\n00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.026\nWhy don't we type in Joey?\n\n133\n00:07:04.026 --> 00:07:08.653\nNow as soon as I typed in Joey, notice,\nthat popped up immediately, didn't it?\n\n134\n00:07:08.653 --> 00:07:12.058\nAnd it popped up\nimmediately in my contacts,\n\n135\n00:07:12.058 --> 00:07:15.730\nbecause Joey is part of\nour OfficeProDemo core,\n\n136\n00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:21.040\nour whole network, JT is on that,\nJoey's on that and so is Lance.\n\n137\n00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.720\nSo that's gonna pop up automatically, but\n\n138\n00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.860\nnot Wess, but\nI know he's out there [LAUGH].\n\n139\n00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:35.270\nSo if I keep on going, if I say\nwes@itpro.tv, and I know that that's him.\n\n140\n00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.420\nI can see something going on.\n\n141\n00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.740\nHe's not really in my contacts,\nbut he is there.\n\n142\n00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:47.029\nSo that is something that's gonna\npop up throughout the thing and\n\n143\n00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:49.251\nso it's this weird thing.\n\n144\n00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:52.920\nHe is not a contact, but\nhe's still coming up and\n\n145\n00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.792\nI could go ahead and add him from here.\n\n146\n00:07:55.792 --> 00:08:01.121\nBut if I went out to here, let's type\nin Wes and go to Skype directory.\n\n147\n00:08:01.121 --> 00:08:02.563\nNow with the Skype directory,\n\n148\n00:08:02.563 --> 00:08:05.402\nNow I'm searching it's like\ngoing back to that phonebook.\n\n149\n00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:10.166\nRight, I'm going back out to every\nsingle person that is named Wes and\n\n150\n00:08:10.166 --> 00:08:13.257\nyou can see I've got\nsome different places.\n\n151\n00:08:13.257 --> 00:08:16.000\nI've got the Netherlands and\neverything like that.\n\n152\n00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.740\nI can go through all these\ndifferent places and\n\n153\n00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.520\nyou can see I have some I've got\na little pictures and the dome.\n\n154\n00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.470\nBecause this is searching I'm\nactually searching not just Skype for\n\n155\n00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.640\nBusiness, I'm searching Skype.\n\n156\n00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.410\n&gt;&gt; Skype directory\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the whole thing.\n\n157\n00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.398\nSo this is like your registered\nwithin a Microsoft account and\n\n158\n00:08:34.398 --> 00:08:36.932\nyou've gone into Skype this\nis where you can see it.\n\n159\n00:08:36.932 --> 00:08:42.186\nSo there's a lot of different places\nwhere you can find people, whether it's\n\n160\n00:08:42.186 --> 00:08:47.131\ninternally within your organization and\nthat would be into my contacts.\n\n161\n00:08:47.131 --> 00:08:50.980\nAnd normally you could go ahead just\ntype in their one name and it'll pop up.\n\n162\n00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.650\nGoing out to the Skype directory,\nyou can find them, but\n\n163\n00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:59.980\nif I know Wes at ITProTV is his contact,\nI will just go ahead and bring that in.\n\n164\n00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.859\nAnd I probably actually add them in in\na different way, which I'll show you.\n\n165\n00:09:03.859 --> 00:09:08.450\nBut anyway, it's kinda talking about\nwhat you can and cannot see, okay?\n\n166\n00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.890\nRight here,\nI thought this was really interesting.\n\n167\n00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.830\nSkype for Business on a Mac doesn't\nhave the ability to search and\n\n168\n00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.590\ncommunicate with people who\nare using the free Skype app.\n\n169\n00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:24.280\nIt doesn't have that connection into\nthe whole big place that we're looking for\n\n170\n00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.980\nright in here.\n\n171\n00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.060\nIt's not gonna be able to search that.\n\n172\n00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:30.950\nKinda make sense?\n\n173\n00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.430\n&gt;&gt; It does, in this sense, right?\n\n174\n00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.710\nWhat Vaughn is actually helping us\nto understand, if for one reason or\n\n175\n00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:41.010\nanother you happen to be on Skype for\nBusiness on a Mac you're not gonna get all\n\n176\n00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:45.670\nthe full featured benefits that you might\nbe seeing in what Vaughn is showing you.\n\n177\n00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:50.851\nAnd that is a limitation of the way that\nSkype for business itself has developed\n\n178\n00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:56.112\novertime it was really, first Microsoft\nlink and now it's been forwarded into\n\n179\n00:09:56.112 --> 00:10:01.162\nthe way that needs to be an hour just been\nkind of modify the work Inside a Mac.\n\n180\n00:10:01.162 --> 00:10:04.640\nAnd that means they had to disable certain\nthings cuz they didn't work that well.\n\n181\n00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.460\nAnd even in Skype for business today,\n\n182\n00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:11.190\nit's not fully it's not a fully featured\nas what we see on the Windows product.\n\n183\n00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI mean it is a full Windows product.\n\n184\n00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.390\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So they just made a Mac version.\n\n185\n00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.730\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So there are going to be some little\n\n186\n00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.240\nnuances right there.\n\n187\n00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.920\nYou can search for and find Skype user.\n\n188\n00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.700\nThey cannot search for and\nfind Skype for business users.\n\n189\n00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.580\nOkay, so its kind of like one,\nits a one way.\n\n190\n00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.181\nCan't go the other way.\n\n191\n00:10:29.181 --> 00:10:31.378\nAnd then also, people using Skype for\n\n192\n00:10:31.378 --> 00:10:34.750\nbusiness link cannot search\nthe Skype directory either.\n\n193\n00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.290\nThe other thing,\nyour IT department determines whether or\n\n194\n00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:42.760\nnot you can use this interface, and where\nand when what you can search on Skype.\n\n195\n00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.150\nSo, back into that whole\nyour network directory and\n\n196\n00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.398\nadministrators, they can control\nwhat you can and can not see and\n\n197\n00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:53.885\nyou could see the talks what the different\nways, we talked about like the one name,\n\n198\n00:10:53.885 --> 00:10:58.110\nWes versus their full email address.\n\n199\n00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.870\nSo there's different levels\nthat you might go through and\n\n200\n00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:05.210\nagain it does say That before\nyou can search the Skype for.\n\n201\n00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:09.600\nYou need to have it set within\nyour organization setting.\n\n202\n00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.300\nJust to show you this particular link,\n\n203\n00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.810\nthis is going out to showing you stuff\nthat it goes into your admin centers.\n\n204\n00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.170\nYou might not even have\nthat type of control.\n\n205\n00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.390\nProbably a lot of you in\na larger organization,\n\n206\n00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.560\nyou're not gonna have any of that.\n\n207\n00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:29.533\nSo it this, if you're like, I'm going\ninto my search, it doesn't always work.\n\n208\n00:11:29.533 --> 00:11:34.006\nAnd then you can see that Skype for\nBusiness is used to collaborate,\n\n209\n00:11:34.006 --> 00:11:38.952\nnotice that like you can have users\nfrom Skype connect into your meeting but\n\n210\n00:11:38.952 --> 00:11:44.133\nthey're not going to be able to be able\nto use all of the functionalities of it,\n\n211\n00:11:44.133 --> 00:11:46.750\nwith the files, all the whiteboards.\n\n212\n00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.480\nThese are different things that we'll get\ninto when we get into the meetings but\n\n213\n00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:54.930\njust kinda showing you that it\ndoes have some limitations.\n\n214\n00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.590\nAnd so yes, you as Skype for\n\n215\n00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:02.350\nBusiness can add Skype people, but\nit's not the other way around.\n\n216\n00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.420\n&gt;&gt; Right, it actually is kind of one\nof those things where, with Skype for\n\n217\n00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.580\nBusiness it's a lot more full featured.\n\n218\n00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.640\nAnd even the regular Skype client,\nregardless of whether you're on Windows or\n\n219\n00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.650\nwhether you're on a Mac.\n\n220\n00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:15.760\nOn a Mac, it's even more limited\ninside of Windows right,\n\n221\n00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.970\nif you're just running the regular Skype\napp that was already installed in windows\n\n222\n00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:23.720\nwhen you first got it, is also limited\nin comparison in this type of business.\n\n223\n00:12:25.028 --> 00:12:27.910\nThis Skype for Business is gonna give you\nall this other features especially in\n\n224\n00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.940\ncollaboration issues or\ncollaboration features or issues.\n\n225\n00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.450\nNow that you should think about and if you\nneed those that's what you have to kind of\n\n226\n00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.110\nbank your subscription up to to\nmake sure that you have that.\n\n227\n00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.400\nYeah, and\nthis is something I always found too.\n\n228\n00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.390\nThis SkypeId.net\n\n229\n00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:49.330\ncuz I typed in his full address and\nI know that's his Skype.\n\n230\n00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:50.211\nCuz I know.\n\n231\n00:12:50.211 --> 00:12:53.150\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But it's doing this weird thing and\n\n232\n00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.750\nI'm like what is that cuz it's trying\nto find it within the Skype directory.\n\n233\n00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:00.240\nBut notice if I switch over to my\ncontacts then it doesn't do that weird\n\n234\n00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.300\nthing because this is\na valid email address and\n\n235\n00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:07.220\nthis is a valid Skype address,\nit just might not always pop up.\n\n236\n00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:12.090\nSo don't fully rely on the search or\nthe find to add people.\n\n237\n00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:16.010\nAnd just like I could make a contact\nin my phone and it's wrong.\n\n238\n00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.343\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Like I could go ahead and put in like,\n\n239\n00:13:18.343 --> 00:13:21.985\nyou know Ronnie and I could have\na totally wrong number for you.\n\n240\n00:13:21.985 --> 00:13:24.300\nIt's still going to show\nup in my contacts so\n\n241\n00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.362\nagain I'm kind of meandering around a\nlittle bit but just to show you like this\n\n242\n00:13:28.362 --> 00:13:32.830\none for example Tiffany Robert good\nfriend of mine, we used to work together.\n\n243\n00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.380\nI know that's her email address, I can\nadd it in but I can tell you right now,\n\n244\n00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:37.800\nit doesn't work.\n\n245\n00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.020\nOkay, I know it doesn't and I will show\nyou that when we get into the IMing issues\n\n246\n00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:45.070\nor the Instant Messaging, but\nI can add it, it just doesn't mean it's\n\n247\n00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.850\nthe right person and there is\nsomebody on the other end, all right?\n\n248\n00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.050\nSo those are the ways you can find.\n\n249\n00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.910\nBut like I said like how do I add in Wes,\nwon't it just be a little bit different.\n\n250\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:58.054\nNotice in my groups or in my contacts,\nright over here this button.\n\n251\n00:13:58.054 --> 00:13:59.570\nAdd a contact.\n\n252\n00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.530\nI would just go ahead and\nadd him, not in my organization.\n\n253\n00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:07.830\nI would just say let me just go ahead and\nadd him as a Skype for Business and\n\n254\n00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:12.610\ngo ahead and put him in there,\ntell him where I wanna go ahead and\n\n255\n00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:18.030\nput him in my organization of my Skype\ncontacts and just add it, right?\n\n256\n00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.900\nSo you can just Directly type it in\nright from here, if wanted to add it.\n\n257\n00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.530\nDo notice, not in my organization or\nin my organization.\n\n258\n00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:30.010\nThat does make slightly\nbit of a difference,\n\n259\n00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.640\nalso with when we talk about\nour privacy relationships.\n\n260\n00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.290\nWhich we will get into in another episode.\n\n261\n00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:40.439\nRight now, it's just adding finding,\nadding, and organizing my.\n\n262\n00:14:40.439 --> 00:14:45.287\nSo that's how we can start to do it, so\nnow once I go ahead and find the person,\n\n263\n00:14:45.287 --> 00:14:47.090\nor do the different things.\n\n264\n00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.310\nLet's go over those other\nways that I can add people.\n\n265\n00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:53.340\nWell I'm repeating myself now,\nI'm doing a little circle.\n\n266\n00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.480\nI just showed you that I could go\nahead and do this right from here.\n\n267\n00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.120\nAdd in Wes ITPro.TV.\n\n268\n00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.050\nYep, notice there is a little check box.\n\n269\n00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:02.866\nI know it's good.\n\n270\n00:15:02.866 --> 00:15:05.460\nWe'll talk about all of this later.\n\n271\n00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.580\nFor now add, okay.\n\n272\n00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:09.360\nPerfect.\n\n273\n00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.280\nHe goes right in there.\n\n274\n00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.260\nHe goes into the other contacts.\n\n275\n00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.180\nAnd he is available.\n\n276\n00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.410\nThe other way I could do this if I\ndid search for something like Joey.\n\n277\n00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:18.930\nAll right?\n\n278\n00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:24.490\nI do need to add Joey in to my contacts\ncuz I haven't got him in here.\n\n279\n00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.670\nHe is in my Outlook contacts,\njust pulling up Outlook, right?\n\n280\n00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:31.990\nI do have a whole bunch of people,\nbut he's not in Skype.\n\n281\n00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.820\nSo I gotta add him separately.\n\n282\n00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.390\nSo I come over into here.\n\n283\n00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.940\nYep, this is Joey.\n\n284\n00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.900\nI want to go ahead and add him in.\n\n285\n00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.870\nOnce I have searched for\nhim, how do I do it?\n\n286\n00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.800\nYou can right click on him.\n\n287\n00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.605\nFrom here I can right click and\nI can add to my contacts list.\n\n288\n00:15:48.605 --> 00:15:52.077\nNow I can add him directly into\nmy favorites totally fine because\n\n289\n00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:55.935\nthe favorites are just those you know\nyou have your favorites in your web\n\n290\n00:15:55.935 --> 00:15:59.042\nbrowsers which are the things\nthat you frequently go to.\n\n291\n00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:02.182\nI can add him into the contact list.\n\n292\n00:16:02.182 --> 00:16:03.303\nIn some type of group.\n\n293\n00:16:03.303 --> 00:16:09.380\nRight now I do have a created called\nITProTV and I have other contacts.\n\n294\n00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.730\nYou know what for now I'm just\ngonna put him in other contacts.\n\n295\n00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:12.660\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n296\n00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.880\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like we're just\ngonna organize them later.\n\n297\n00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:21.046\nDo know that look at them, notice I have,\nJoey, got my dancing shoes on.\n\n298\n00:16:21.046 --> 00:16:26.450\nOkay, well [LAUGH] I can see his note,\nhis full presence.\n\n299\n00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:30.170\nWhy can I see his full presence and\nnot Marisa's?\n\n300\n00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:32.180\nOr Wes?\n\n301\n00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.640\nWell, that's because we\nare on the same network.\n\n302\n00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.780\nI can see a lot more stuff about Joey,\nthan I can with Wes because he's\n\n303\n00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.840\nan external contact, and\nyou can see it right there.\n\n304\n00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:47.530\nWes is on an external network,\nJoey is available and\n\n305\n00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.990\nvideo capable that means he's within,\nright.\n\n306\n00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:56.990\nAnd then even this one, notice like my\nOffice Pro demo co on my Outlook account,\n\n307\n00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.330\nthat's a Skype,\nthat is not Skype for Business.\n\n308\n00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.410\nSo it's given me a little bit\nof information about like\n\n309\n00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:07.000\nwhere these people are in\nthe organizations.\n\n310\n00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.880\nWhether they are external, internal based\non these little pieces right in here.\n\n311\n00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.570\nSo those are some different\nways that I can add.\n\n312\n00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:16.900\nThere's a couple other\nways that I can do this.\n\n313\n00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:22.120\nI have the new button,\nnow this new tab over here\n\n314\n00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:26.890\nthis is where it's saying people who have\nadded you as a contact will show up here.\n\n315\n00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.680\nAdd them to your contacts list to make\nsure that they can contact you when\n\n316\n00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.270\nthey see you around.\n\n317\n00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:35.170\nBecause what happens is that\nTaylor went ahead and added JT.\n\n318\n00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.840\nTo his but he might be having\nsomething that says pending.\n\n319\n00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.840\nPending, it's waiting to see like\nif the other person is going to add\n\n320\n00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.550\nyou especially if it's like in\nexternal networks necessary.\n\n321\n00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:50.440\nSo that's another ways like hey I can\ntell you, Taylor went ahead and add me.\n\n322\n00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.347\nCuz I can be in all sorts of\npeople's contact list [LAUGH] and\n\n323\n00:17:53.347 --> 00:17:56.370\nhave no idea I will say\nthis doesn't always work.\n\n324\n00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:01.650\nIf somebody is contacting you or\ntrying to add you that's on Skype,\n\n325\n00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.130\nremember that it's not\na full connection sometimes.\n\n326\n00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:07.375\nSo there could be some things like,\nI added you.\n\n327\n00:18:07.375 --> 00:18:11.150\nWell I didn't see it,\nit didn't show up in the new.\n\n328\n00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:12.240\nIt's just part of the game.\n\n329\n00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.860\nSo don't always rely on\nthis as that where you\n\n330\n00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:21.050\nalways know every single person that\nhas added you to their contact list.\n\n331\n00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.800\nBut from here I could just go ahead and\nright click and\n\n332\n00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.490\nthen send him into my other contacts for\nnow, and then I went ahead and added him.\n\n333\n00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:32.680\nThere is one other way that you\ncan go ahead and add contacts.\n\n334\n00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:39.230\nAnd that's with having a conversation with\nsomebody that wasn't in your contacts.\n\n335\n00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.230\nBecause its just like we talked about,\nI can call somebody that's not in my\n\n336\n00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.830\ncontacts, we can still go ahead and\nmake a conversation.\n\n337\n00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.518\nAnd then later I can go into that and\nto like my recent calls and\n\n338\n00:18:47.518 --> 00:18:50.170\nbe like, I need to make that a contact.\n\n339\n00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:50.850\nSame way here.\n\n340\n00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:56.470\nWe will talk about what saved\ncommunication are, saved conversations and\n\n341\n00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.250\nall of that jazz in a little\nbit later episodes but for now,\n\n342\n00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.917\nI just wanted to show you that I had\n[LAUGH] I had a conversation with myself.\n\n343\n00:19:03.917 --> 00:19:04.566\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Nice.\n\n344\n00:19:04.566 --> 00:19:07.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I had a conversation\nwith Wong at ITProTV.\n\n345\n00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:11.960\nAnd so I can go right from my calls or\n\n346\n00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:16.830\nconversations not the contact go to\nmy conversations come into here.\n\n347\n00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:22.300\nI can right click and then I can go\nahead and add to my contacts so,\n\n348\n00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.229\nlots of different ways to go ahead and\njust start filling up your contact list.\n\n349\n00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:32.020\nAnd then these are the people that I\nwant to always have ready to go to start\n\n350\n00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.790\ncommunicating with.\n\n351\n00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.660\nBut I wanna organize them, okay,\n\n352\n00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.130\nbecause right now we have\nthem all in other contacts.\n\n353\n00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.110\nAnd why is Marisha in my favorites,\n\n354\n00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.320\nwell that's cuz we talk every day,\nyou know that.\n\n355\n00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.250\nSo we go ahead, so\nhow can I make another group?\n\n356\n00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.620\nHow can I organize it?\n\n357\n00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.740\nIt's pretty simple honestly.\n\n358\n00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.490\nIf I wanted to make a new group,\nokay so I have IT Pro TV,\n\n359\n00:19:55.490 --> 00:20:00.130\nI have quite a few contacts at IT Pro TV\nthat I would like to put into a group.\n\n360\n00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:05.470\nUp here at the top you have a little plus\nsign and you can create a new group.\n\n361\n00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:08.220\nSo I will create a group and\nI will name this,\n\n362\n00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.090\ndown at the bottom,\nI will name this IT Pro TV.\n\n363\n00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:17.140\nAnd I'll just hit enter to accept that and\nso here is my group.\n\n364\n00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.592\nIf I want I already have IT Pro TV.\n\n365\n00:20:19.592 --> 00:20:23.270\n[LAUGH] Okay you know what\nI did that on purpose!\n\n366\n00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:26.742\nNo I didn't I forgot that I was\nsupposed to make an Office Pro group.\n\n367\n00:20:26.742 --> 00:20:31.430\nWrong one that's all right because\nwhat If I don't like this group?\n\n368\n00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.320\nI can go ahead and delete the group\nbecause there's nobody in there right now.\n\n369\n00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.070\nSo I will go ahead and delete that one.\n\n370\n00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.210\nSo let's go ahead and\nmake the group that I wanted to\n\n371\n00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:45.050\nwhich was Office Pro, there we go.\n\n372\n00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:46.434\nOffice Pro demo co.\n\n373\n00:20:46.434 --> 00:20:48.188\nThat's a lot of letters.\n\n374\n00:20:48.188 --> 00:20:50.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n375\n00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.330\nI want Joey to go down into there.\n\n376\n00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.890\nNow, there's a couple of\nways that I could do this.\n\n377\n00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.280\nI could drag and drop him, okay?\n\n378\n00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:02.130\nBut there's a couple of things in the way\nyou can also collapse these groups like if\n\n379\n00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:06.510\nI collapse down like by little triangle,\nITPro.TV that might make it a little bit\n\n380\n00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:12.610\ncloser for me to grab him right here,\ndrag him down.\n\n381\n00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:17.260\nAnd notice that my icon goes\nfrom like a non, like a slash.\n\n382\n00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:21.330\nYup, there's a little bosque, it's kinda\nhard to see at the bottom of my mouse.\n\n383\n00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:25.100\nAnd then it goes ahead and\nadds him right on down in there.\n\n384\n00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.570\nSo now I've got him in the Office Pro.\n\n385\n00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:28.870\nLet's take West.\n\n386\n00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:33.630\nWest needs to get down into\nthe ITProTV family I can drag and\n\n387\n00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.310\ndrop him, totally fine.\n\n388\n00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.150\nYou could also right-click and\n\n389\n00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:42.180\nthen you can move the contact to\nwhatever group that you have created.\n\n390\n00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:45.125\nSo I can do it that way,\nmove him on down so\n\n391\n00:21:45.125 --> 00:21:51.265\nnow all of the IT Pro people are in there,\nI have some of my other contacts.\n\n392\n00:21:51.265 --> 00:21:54.065\nTaylor is IT ProTV too,\nso, but I don't know,\n\n393\n00:21:54.065 --> 00:21:57.427\nI feel like he might need to go in his\nown special group right there, you know?\n\n394\n00:21:57.427 --> 00:21:58.387\nAs a, you know what?\n\n395\n00:21:58.387 --> 00:21:59.797\nWe can have him.\n\n396\n00:21:59.797 --> 00:22:04.427\nWe can go ahead and say Team Ninja.\n\n397\n00:22:04.427 --> 00:22:06.077\nBecause that's what we are.\n\n398\n00:22:06.077 --> 00:22:07.025\nWoo hoo.\n\n399\n00:22:07.025 --> 00:22:13.997\nAll right, so I can go ahead and throw in\nTaylor down into our Team Ninja group.\n\n400\n00:22:13.997 --> 00:22:15.477\nAwesome.\nSo this is just the way\n\n401\n00:22:15.477 --> 00:22:19.130\nthat I want to organize my contacts and\nwhat they're associated with.\n\n402\n00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:22.800\nNow, Rene,\nRene is another one of my favorites but\n\n403\n00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.340\nshe's not in my favorites and\nalso notice Mauricia shows up twice, why?\n\n404\n00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.240\nCuz yeah she's in our ITPRO.TV group but\n\n405\n00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:35.010\nshe's also somebody that I frequently\ncontact so I can put her in my favorites.\n\n406\n00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:38.670\nYour favorites is just well a favorites.\n\n407\n00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:42.305\nIt's copy in a sense but\nit's a special copy.\n\n408\n00:22:42.305 --> 00:22:47.320\n[LAUGH] So I'm gonna go ahead and\nput Renee up into my favorites.\n\n409\n00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.400\nSo I am going to move her into.\n\n410\n00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.275\nNo, I need to add her to favorites,\nthere it is okay.\n\n411\n00:22:54.275 --> 00:22:55.880\nOkay.\n[LAUGH] Add a favorite.\n\n412\n00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.670\nNotice I didn't move her, so\nshe didn't leave the group,\n\n413\n00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:03.440\nshe's just added into that favorites.\n\n414\n00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:08.730\nBut also notice that you could take,\nlike say, Ronnie, that's you.\n\n415\n00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:13.680\nI could have him in two places\nbecause right now he's on Team Ninja.\n\n416\n00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:18.830\nHe is on our group with me and Taylor,\nso you can be added into Team Ninja.\n\n417\n00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:24.470\nSo I can copy,\nyour contact into that particular group.\n\n418\n00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:27.378\nSo now you show up on two places.\n\n419\n00:23:27.378 --> 00:23:32.540\nSo, just again all the ways that you\nwant to go ahead and organize it.\n\n420\n00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.810\nWhat if you wanted to,\nif I collapsed some of these down?\n\n421\n00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:41.630\nMaybe I would like to have\nITProTV above other contacts.\n\n422\n00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.270\nI wanna change that around.\n\n423\n00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:48.150\nNotice how if I click on them, like\nthis is a group that I have highlighted,\n\n424\n00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.910\nI can then come over to this button and\nthen I can,\n\n425\n00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:54.540\nis it not, I think it's right-clicking.\n\n426\n00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:55.189\nThere it is, sorry.\n\n427\n00:23:55.189 --> 00:23:59.266\n[LAUGH] If you right-click on the group,\nyou can go move group up, and\n\n428\n00:23:59.266 --> 00:24:00.860\nmove group down.\n\n429\n00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.451\nI've tried dragging it,\nit didn't seem to work very well.\n\n430\n00:24:03.451 --> 00:24:04.791\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the groups, that is.\n\n431\n00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:06.703\nContacts within them,\nthey seem to be fine.\n\n432\n00:24:06.703 --> 00:24:11.480\nBut you will have to go through and\nchange it from there.\n\n433\n00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.260\nYou could also rename the group if you\nwanted it to be something different.\n\n434\n00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.660\nSo there's a couple different things\nthat you can do from the right clicking.\n\n435\n00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:22.350\nSo now we've added everybody.\n\n436\n00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:25.840\nSometimes people need to just\nget off your contact list.\n\n437\n00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.610\nYou just don't really talk to them\nanymore, maybe they've gone to\n\n438\n00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:32.710\na different department or a different\njob and we need to take them off.\n\n439\n00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:39.059\nSo for example if I wanted to for\nsome reason take off this person, myself.\n\n440\n00:24:39.059 --> 00:24:43.060\n[LAUGH] I don't really need\nto have them there anymore.\n\n441\n00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:46.620\nWell if I take them out of the group,\n\n442\n00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:50.110\nI'm just taking them out of\nthe group they just kind of become\n\n443\n00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:55.110\nwell it actually removes because other\ncontacts in the group is I can have it.\n\n444\n00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.190\nSo let me go ahead and remove that.\n\n445\n00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:58.130\nSo what if I do this one.\n\n446\n00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:02.450\nIf I try to take out Wes\nright if I take out Wes and\n\n447\n00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.980\nremove him from the group Now, it is\nremoving him from your contacts list.\n\n448\n00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.170\nHe actually goes all the way out,\ndoesn't he.\n\n449\n00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.050\nOkay, I thought he would actually\ngo into like your other contacts.\n\n450\n00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I would've thought.\n\n451\n00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:13.140\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n452\n00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:13.760\n&gt;&gt; I thought so too.\n\n453\n00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.810\n&gt;&gt; Maybe not.\n\n454\n00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:16.340\n&gt;&gt; Maybe not.\n\n455\n00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.030\nGuess what, if you remove him from any\ngroup looks like it just goes right off\n\n456\n00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:19.808\nthe contact list.\n\n457\n00:25:19.808 --> 00:25:20.527\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n458\n00:25:20.527 --> 00:25:22.630\n&gt;&gt; I thought it went into the others.\n\n459\n00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.200\nIt doesn't seem like it though.\n\n460\n00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:24.713\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n461\n00:25:24.713 --> 00:25:25.863\n&gt;&gt; Okay well you know what this\n\n462\n00:25:25.863 --> 00:25:28.170\nis a good test for us.\n\n463\n00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.100\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because they just go away.\n\n464\n00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they just go away.\n\n465\n00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:36.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but that is one other way that\nyou can go ahead and remove people from\n\n466\n00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:39.870\nI thought just group and\nyou can stay in the contact list but no.\n\n467\n00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:40.710\nIt looks like this is the same.\n\n468\n00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.570\nBut hey if it works differently\nfrom you and it goes ahead and\n\n469\n00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.700\nremoves it from a group and\nthen puts it into a Another one?\n\n470\n00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.728\n&gt;&gt; A different group.\n\n471\n00:25:47.728 --> 00:25:49.360\n[LAUGH] That's great.\n\n472\n00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.950\nBut do you know that if you take\nthem off you're contact list,\n\n473\n00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:55.670\nthey do get removed off\nyou're contact list.\n\n474\n00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:58.400\nSo, I can go ahead and\ntake them off that way.\n\n475\n00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.560\nSo, that right there I believe covers\neverything that I wanted to in our\n\n476\n00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:08.950\nfinding, our adding And our organizing.\n\n477\n00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.140\nSo different ways that you\ncan go ahead and do that.\n\n478\n00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.870\nAnd I believe that is it for this episode.\n\n479\n00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:18.070\nWe will come back more with statuses and\nthings you can do with your contacts.\n\n480\n00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.920\nReally more about your contact cards.\n\n481\n00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.120\nBecause really what you do with your\ncontacts, you communicate with them.\n\n482\n00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.860\nBut that's another topic so.\n\n483\n00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.240\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne well\nthank you again for\n\n484\n00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:33.700\nhelping us to take a look more at the way\nthat we can of course find contacts.\n\n485\n00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.030\nAnd then add them in to make them useful\nin the way that we're gonna be using Skype\n\n486\n00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:37.890\nfor Business.\n\n487\n00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:40.640\nAs well as organizing them\nin the manner that we want.\n\n488\n00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.420\nAll of this is very important especially\nas your organization continues to grow, or\n\n489\n00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:49.040\nchange to make it easier for\nyou to use Skype for Business.\n\n490\n00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.150\nSo we've still got a lot more\nto go in Skype for Business.\n\n491\n00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:55.110\nSo that means we want you to\nstay tuned for more episodes.\n\n492\n00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:58.620\nBut Vonne, any last parting words\nbefore we sign out of here?\n\n493\n00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.500\n&gt;&gt; Just know that all of us can get\na little weird sometimes in that if you\n\n494\n00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.830\nadd somebody and they say I don't see you,\nand all that, the pending.\n\n495\n00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:07.140\nEspecially with the Skype people.\n\n496\n00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.070\nLike regular Skype people.\n\n497\n00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:14.170\nAnd I think it's actually in that website\nwhere a lot of times for you to really\n\n498\n00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:18.340\nsolidify that you guys are on each others'\ncontact lists is to just IM each other.\n\n499\n00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.130\nJust go ahead and\nsend a message, go ahead and\n\n500\n00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.980\nestablish that you can talk to each other.\n\n501\n00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:26.760\nAnd then a lot of times, that status or\nthe pending will stop being pending.\n\n502\n00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.270\nI know I've done it.\n\n503\n00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.860\nAnd it took a little while.\n\n504\n00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:32.830\nIt's not as fluid as like\nooh look I added Joey.\n\n505\n00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:33.900\n&gt;&gt; Not instantaneous.\n\n506\n00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.820\n&gt;&gt; Look I added Wes.\n\n507\n00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.420\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; The outside of Skype people\n\n508\n00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:38.860\ncan it might take a little bit so.\n\n509\n00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:42.210\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne once again this is\na great place for us to sign off for\n\n510\n00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:43.430\nthis episode then.\n\n511\n00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:45.970\nFor OfficeProTV I'm your host Ronnie

00:00:18.100\nYou are watching the Skype for\nbusiness show.\n\n4\n00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.500\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today\nwe'll be looking at some of the different\n\n5\n00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.110\noptions and status setting that we can do\ninside, of course, Skype for Business.\n\n6\n00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.179\nAnd here to help us once\nagain is gonna be well,\n\n7\n00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.188\nour Office Pro Maven herself, Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:33.188 --> 00:00:34.418\nVonne, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:34.418 --> 00:00:35.871\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was like, did you forget my name?\n\n10\n00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:38.228\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, I like the little,\n\n11\n00:00:38.228 --> 00:00:39.404\nthe suspense there.\n\n12\n00:00:39.404 --> 00:00:40.054\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n13\n00:00:40.054 --> 00:00:41.270\n&gt;&gt; Of like, its me.\n\n14\n00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.958\n&gt;&gt; It is you.\n\n15\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.456\n&gt;&gt; Well, I\"m really JT, I guess.\n\n16\n00:00:43.456 --> 00:00:44.507\n&gt;&gt; You are JT.\n\n17\n00:00:44.507 --> 00:00:46.533\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're JT.\n\n18\n00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.281\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're actually all sorts\n\n19\n00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:49.958\nof different people today, because-\n&gt;&gt; We are,\n\n20\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.630\nwe're actually kind of having to\nsimulate a lot of different people.\n\n21\n00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.330\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne, when we start taking\na look at this idea of status and\n\n22\n00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.400\noptions, this is gonna be important.\n\n23\n00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.140\nEspecially with an organization in which\nthere's many different people that are on,\n\n24\n00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.400\nand whether or not you interrupt\nsomebody in the middle of their day.\n\n25\n00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.500\nAre there ways that we can set this up?\n\n26\n00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.090\nSo we really need to pay attention to\nunderstand what types of options we're\n\n27\n00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.350\ngonna see and\nfigure out what we need to do.\n\n28\n00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.820\nSo Vonne, where are we gonna begin?\n\n29\n00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.452\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're exactly right.\n\n30\n00:01:20.452 --> 00:01:24.416\nAnd this is why people use Skype for\nBusiness, is like hey,\n\n31\n00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.332\ndon't talk to me right now.\n\n32\n00:01:26.332 --> 00:01:28.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or I'm away.\n\n33\n00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.722\nAll this different ways\nthat we can announce our\n\n34\n00:01:31.722 --> 00:01:32.851\npresence,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n35\n00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:34.125\n&gt;&gt; To other people.\n\n36\n00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:38.875\nAnd how it changes internally versus\nexternally, and the different\n\n37\n00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:43.940\nsettings that we're going to be able to\nset, that's what we're gonna go over.\n\n38\n00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.610\nAnd so that's why I called it status and\noptions, because it's going to be not just\n\n39\n00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.080\nsetting your own status, but understanding\nwhat that status means to other people.\n\n40\n00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.103\nLike what I see your status,\nand Joey's status.\n\n41\n00:01:57.103 --> 00:01:57.859\nThat's why you actually have these.\n\n42\n00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.730\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; These two lovely computers right here.\n\n43\n00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.020\nAnd this is actually my old baby right\nhere, still kicking after seven,\n\n44\n00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.795\neight years.\n\n45\n00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:07.568\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; It's really heavy.\n\n46\n00:02:07.568 --> 00:02:09.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Compared to the new MacBook versus\n\n47\n00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.371\nthe old MacBook.\n\n48\n00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:13.200\nSo you're going to be\nimpersonating those two people.\n\n49\n00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.849\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n50\n00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:14.374\n&gt;&gt; Well, I guess,\n\n51\n00:02:14.374 --> 00:02:15.722\nimpersonating yourself is-\n&gt;&gt; Why not?\n\n52\n00:02:15.722 --> 00:02:16.293\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n53\n00:02:16.293 --> 00:02:17.347\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do it.\n\n54\n00:02:17.347 --> 00:02:20.847\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're gonna go ahead and\nhave some different changes.\n\n55\n00:02:20.847 --> 00:02:23.385\nLet's just jump on down and get going.\n\n56\n00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:26.053\nSo you could see that I have Skype for\nBusiness sign in.\n\n57\n00:02:26.053 --> 00:02:30.769\nI do wanna take notice of one\nthing that I have changed\n\n58\n00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.671\nfrom the episode before to now.\n\n59\n00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:37.587\nI put a couple different more people,\na few more people in my favorites.\n\n60\n00:02:37.587 --> 00:02:39.337\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just to kinda keep the people\n\n61\n00:02:39.337 --> 00:02:42.658\nthat we're going to be kind of interacting\nwith, at least in the sense of in\n\n62\n00:02:42.658 --> 00:02:46.155\nour contact list, cuz we still haven't\ncommunicated with anybody just yet.\n\n63\n00:02:46.155 --> 00:02:47.414\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n64\n00:02:47.414 --> 00:02:53.700\n&gt;&gt; And the other thing is, do you see that\nlittle number 1 up there in my contacts?\n\n65\n00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.598\nAny time you see little numbers in\nred in any of these tabs, really,\n\n66\n00:02:58.598 --> 00:03:00.840\neither whether they're in\nthe conversations or in your contacts,\n\n67\n00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.700\nit means something new has happened.\n\n68\n00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.090\nSo let's jump in and see.\n\n69\n00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.460\nWell, I'm already in my contacts.\n\n70\n00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.560\nWell look.\nAs soon as I clicked on it,\n\n71\n00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.870\nit took me directly to the place that\nis saying hey, there's something new.\n\n72\n00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.010\nIt's like an alert that you need to\njump in here and see what's going on.\n\n73\n00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.010\nAnd you could see that\nTonisha has went ahead and\n\n74\n00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.110\nadded JT to her list of contacts.\n\n75\n00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.410\nSo it was alerting me to that fact.\n\n76\n00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.030\nSo if you ever see that, that's what that\nmeans, cuz as soon as I switch over to my\n\n77\n00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.140\ngroups, notice that the number\n1 isn't there anymore.\n\n78\n00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.720\nAnd that's the reason why, if you had\nwatched our previous episode when we had\n\n79\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.920\nTaylor, who had added JT,\nit didn't have a number 1.\n\n80\n00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.096\nI had already gone to there, and\nI had already shown up on the new tab.\n\n81\n00:03:45.096 --> 00:03:50.065\nI was like, good, it showed up, because I\nwanted to go ahead and demonstrate that.\n\n82\n00:03:50.065 --> 00:03:55.240\nSo that was the reason why Taylor,\nit's not cuz Taylor isn't read worthy.\n\n83\n00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.895\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's just cuz I already found that out.\n\n84\n00:03:57.895 --> 00:04:00.964\nSo just wanted to throw that out for\nyou guys.\n\n85\n00:04:00.964 --> 00:04:05.365\nAnd right here in my favorites, I can see\nthat all of my favorite people, well,\n\n86\n00:04:05.365 --> 00:04:07.090\nthey're available, right?\n\n87\n00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.949\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n88\n00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:11.108\n&gt;&gt; I can see that they all have the green\nlittle check boxes right next to\n\n89\n00:04:11.108 --> 00:04:12.100\ntheir names.\n\n90\n00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.425\nAnd also notice that there's\na couple things when I hover over,\n\n91\n00:04:16.425 --> 00:04:21.610\nI'm hovering over the picture\nof each one of my contacts.\n\n92\n00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.390\nBut notice like here,\n\n93\n00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.100\nif I start hovering over their names,\nthose different things don't pop up.\n\n94\n00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.500\nHovering over the pictures is\njust gonna give you the buttons\n\n95\n00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.590\nof the different ways that you\ncan communicate with them.\n\n96\n00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.530\nThere's so many different ways to\nopen up a chat, or open up an audio,\n\n97\n00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.970\nor a video call within Skype.\n\n98\n00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.260\nBut just wanted to point those two small\nlittle things out, hovering names,\n\n99\n00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.500\nhovering pictures, and the different\nthings that you have, and the option.\n\n100\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.590\nYou can always right click, and we've\nbeen doing that in the other episode.\n\n101\n00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.420\nThere's whole other things that we were\ndoing with the copying and removing.\n\n102\n00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:04.020\nBut you can see that these are all\nthe different actions you can take\n\n103\n00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.866\nwithin your contact list\nup here on the top.\n\n104\n00:05:06.866 --> 00:05:10.040\nSo, I think there's at least\n15 other ways to do it too.\n\n105\n00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we'll see those along the way.\n\n106\n00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.630\nSo I've got our status.\n\n107\n00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.420\nAnd I don't know if you noticed,\nyou all out there, Ronnie, Ronald Wong.\n\n108\n00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.350\nI've also changed him.\n\n109\n00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.400\nHe was Ronnie last time, and\nnow I wound back to Ronald.\n\n110\n00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.780\nI deleted him from my Outlook contacts,\nbecause.\n\n111\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.590\nAnd we'll talk about once you're in Skype,\nand then putting him into Outlook, and\n\n112\n00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.840\nhow that all connects in the next episode\nwhen we talk about our contact cards and\n\n113\n00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.920\nthe changing of the relationship status.\n\n114\n00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.258\nBut I also just wanted to point that out,\n\n115\n00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:43.635\nif you're like,\nthat doesn't look the same.\n\n116\n00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.810\nRonnie has turned to Ronald.\n\n117\n00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.270\nI did that on purpose, okay,\njust to kind of keep everything in here.\n\n118\n00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.820\nAnd also, you might have noticed,\nyou went yellow for a little bit.\n\n119\n00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.775\nYou did, yeah, because you weren't\ndoing anything over there, Ronnie.\n\n120\n00:05:56.775 --> 00:05:59.304\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Except stand there looking pretty like\n\n121\n00:05:59.304 --> 00:05:59.921\nyou always do.\n\n122\n00:05:59.921 --> 00:06:00.488\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n123\n00:06:00.488 --> 00:06:02.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's an interesting description.\n\n124\n00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.670\n&gt;&gt; But this is gonna happen\nagain with Joey over here,\n\n125\n00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.100\nis that, in a couple more minutes\nhe is going to become inactive.\n\n126\n00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.680\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n127\n00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.860\n&gt;&gt; And that's why we can see\nthese different settings.\n\n128\n00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.270\nBut right now,\neverybody's green, ready to go.\n\n129\n00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.503\nI also have the website pulled up that\nis in our episode notes to go ahead and\n\n130\n00:06:23.503 --> 00:06:28.244\ngive you the idea of our presence and\nwhat information is available.\n\n131\n00:06:28.244 --> 00:06:29.594\nNotice there is a Windows and Mac.\n\n132\n00:06:29.594 --> 00:06:32.680\nSince this is the Windows show\nI'm going to stay over here.\n\n133\n00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.970\nAnd we briefly went over this when we were\njust exploring the interface of Skype, is\n\n134\n00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:42.500\nthat I could ahead and set my own status,\nwhat everybody else is going to see.\n\n135\n00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.960\nAnd right now,\nJT is available right there.\n\n136\n00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.510\nI've changed my location to Studio 1,\nbut I can always come back in here and\n\n137\n00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.460\nchange it.\n\n138\n00:06:52.460 --> 00:07:00.840\nThis will change automatically,\nbased on my calendar options in Outlook.\n\n139\n00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.690\nAnd that's where I actually had\nsomething on there for a while.\n\n140\n00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:05.860\nIt's already past it.\n\n141\n00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.830\nBut it will go ahead and update that,\n\n142\n00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.570\ndepending on what's going on in my\ncalendar, but I can always override it.\n\n143\n00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:18.430\nIf it was pulling out that I was in\na meeting, or an appointment, and\n\n144\n00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.330\nwe can actually set it right here.\n\n145\n00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.060\nWhy don't we do this?\n\n146\n00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.610\nI'm back in Outlook,\njust to go ahead and demonstrate this.\n\n147\n00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.780\nThat this is going to be today for,\nlet's do 3:30, so\n\n148\n00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.362\nyou guys can see the change in my status.\n\n149\n00:07:30.362 --> 00:07:34.558\nAnd we'll just go ahead and\nsay, testing status.\n\n150\n00:07:34.558 --> 00:07:38.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we'll just go ahead and\n\n151\n00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.750\nput that on my calendar.\n\n152\n00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:40.991\nIt is for today.\n\n153\n00:07:40.991 --> 00:07:45.146\nPerfect, so\nyou can see that it is in there.\n\n154\n00:07:45.146 --> 00:07:47.845\nAnd I got my little-\n&gt;&gt; Reminder.\n\n155\n00:07:47.845 --> 00:07:48.677\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those reminders.\n\n156\n00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:50.900\nThank you,\nI was losing my train of thought.\n\n157\n00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.056\nI was like, what is that exactly?\n\n158\n00:07:52.056 --> 00:07:54.986\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it will pull up on my schedule and\n\n159\n00:07:54.986 --> 00:07:59.286\nmy meetings in just a little bit,\nand it will change my status.\n\n160\n00:07:59.286 --> 00:08:00.370\nAnd there we go.\n\n161\n00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.890\nYou could go ahead and\nsee that Joey has turned Inactive.\n\n162\n00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.262\nWhat does that exactly mean?\n\n163\n00:08:09.262 --> 00:08:14.260\nIt doesn't mean that he's not there and\nhe's not at his desk.\n\n164\n00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.206\nWell, it could be, [LAUGH] but let's\ngo ahead and pull this website back for\n\n165\n00:08:19.206 --> 00:08:20.631\nwhat does that mean.\n\n166\n00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:24.172\nSo when you have Away and Inactive,\n\n167\n00:08:24.172 --> 00:08:29.968\nwhat it means is that he is\nstill logged in to his computer.\n\n168\n00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:33.350\nAnd he might still be there at his desk.\n\n169\n00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.899\nHe just hasn't put\nthe focus back on to Skype.\n\n170\n00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:41.589\nHe's gone off and is working in Word,\nor working in Excel, or\n\n171\n00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:46.298\ndoing something else and\nnot even paying attention to Skype.\n\n172\n00:08:46.298 --> 00:08:46.899\nMaybe Joey [LAUGH] has it minimized and\nhe's working on\n\n173\n00:08:46.899 --> 00:08:47.499\nsomething else, and\nthat's what Inactive means.\n\n174\n00:08:47.499 --> 00:08:55.095\nThis is going to automatically switch for\n\n175\n00:08:55.095 --> 00:08:59.007\nyour status as well.\n\n176\n00:08:59.007 --> 00:09:02.715\nIf I stopped playing in Skype,\nmine would turn to Inactive and\n\n177\n00:09:02.715 --> 00:09:06.080\nanybody on their contact list\nwould see the same thing.\n\n178\n00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.040\nExcept for after five minutes.\n\n179\n00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.900\nSo let me go ahead and\nshow you where that's in your options.\n\n180\n00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.150\nIf you go into,\nI believe it's Status, right there.\n\n181\n00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:20.640\nShow me it's Inactive when my computer\nhas been idle for this many minutes.\n\n182\n00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.380\nIt just hasn't been doing anything,\nall right?\n\n183\n00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.960\nBut once you have been inactive for\n\n184\n00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.170\nfive minutes, then it turns to Away.\n\n185\n00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.332\nSo these two things I feel\ncan be a little misleading.\n\n186\n00:09:36.332 --> 00:09:42.207\nBecause maybe you got in a conversation\nwith your coworker or your boss came in.\n\n187\n00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:47.920\nAnd you were physically turned from your\ncomputer, stopped typing on the keyboard.\n\n188\n00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.677\nAnd it's showing that you're away,\nbut you're really there.\n\n189\n00:09:51.677 --> 00:09:56.434\nOkay, so just keep that in mind that\nthis is what these things mean of like,\n\n190\n00:09:56.434 --> 00:09:58.493\nwell, the person's inactive.\n\n191\n00:09:58.493 --> 00:09:59.910\nI can't talk to them.\n\n192\n00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:06.630\nThey're away, so I can't IM them or\naudio call them or any of those things.\n\n193\n00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.020\nJust try it, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.824\nAnd let's do this,\nlet's come back over here to our Skype.\n\n195\n00:10:11.824 --> 00:10:12.723\nI'm already in Skype.\n\n196\n00:10:12.723 --> 00:10:14.567\nI'm just in the [LAUGH] Options.\n\n197\n00:10:14.567 --> 00:10:16.459\nBut notice, you could change this.\n\n198\n00:10:16.459 --> 00:10:19.918\nIf you don't want it to do five minutes,\nbump that up or\n\n199\n00:10:19.918 --> 00:10:23.773\ndown depending on when you want\nyour status to change there.\n\n200\n00:10:23.773 --> 00:10:26.570\nLet me go ahead and cancel that out.\n\n201\n00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.810\nSo Joey, would you mind just\nlike move you're mouse or\n\n202\n00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.670\nclick on Skype or\nsomething to that, there you go.\n\n203\n00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.600\nYou see it's automatically\nchanged back to available.\n\n204\n00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.280\nAnd all right, wonderful, and\n\n205\n00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.220\nit would be the same thing if you\nhad left another ten minutes.\n\n206\n00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.170\nIf ten minutes went by,\n\n207\n00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:47.280\nit would show to me right here on\nmy contact list that Joey was Away.\n\n208\n00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:53.020\nAll right, so\njust know that is the difference\n\n209\n00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.200\nbetween those two particular statuses.\n\n210\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.917\nAnd those are ones that\nhappen automatically.\n\n211\n00:10:59.917 --> 00:11:06.295\nIt's not one that Joey slash\nRonnie went and changed up here.\n\n212\n00:11:06.295 --> 00:11:08.954\nIt didn't show that,\ncuz it says up here Away.\n\n213\n00:11:08.954 --> 00:11:11.910\nThat is an option that he could set.\n\n214\n00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.007\nWhy don't you go ahead and\ndo that up there, Joey?\n\n215\n00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:18.708\n[LAUGH] So now you can see he is Away,\nso he went ahead and\n\n216\n00:11:18.708 --> 00:11:21.689\nchanged his status and that's what I see.\n\n217\n00:11:21.689 --> 00:11:25.587\nBut I could still contact him cuz\nhe's still there, he is still there.\n\n218\n00:11:25.587 --> 00:11:26.864\nThere's something that popped up.\n\n219\n00:11:26.864 --> 00:11:28.656\nIt's actually behind my head, but\n\n220\n00:11:28.656 --> 00:11:31.173\nyou could see that I've\ngot something down here.\n\n221\n00:11:31.173 --> 00:11:32.485\nOop, it just went away.\n\n222\n00:11:32.485 --> 00:11:36.558\nSomething happened with Marisha, we'll\nget back to that in just a little bit.\n\n223\n00:11:36.558 --> 00:11:40.820\nSo anyways, we have our different statuses\nthat happen with Inactive and Away.\n\n224\n00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:41.645\nGood thing to know.\n\n225\n00:11:41.645 --> 00:11:44.840\nWonderful, he could go\nahead change that back.\n\n226\n00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.410\nNotice there's some other ones\nthat with like the Be Right Back,\n\n227\n00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.700\nso other yellow symbols that might happen.\n\n228\n00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:58.940\nThat's one that I would set to say,\nhey, I really am away from my desk.\n\n229\n00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.406\nThe brb, okay?\n\n230\n00:12:00.406 --> 00:12:01.373\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm okay,\n\n231\n00:12:01.373 --> 00:12:03.780\nI'm not just sitting here\ntalking to somebody else and\n\n232\n00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.410\nnot playing on my computer.\n\n233\n00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:11.480\nI really am away, and\nthen we have Off Work.\n\n234\n00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.600\nI'm not here, all right?\n\n235\n00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.844\n[LAUGH] I might be logged into Skype,\nbut I'm not doing anything.\n\n236\n00:12:17.844 --> 00:12:21.845\nSo go ahead and\nnot contact me right there.\n\n237\n00:12:21.845 --> 00:12:25.805\nAnd you could go ahead and set it for\nyourself or you could go ahead and\n\n238\n00:12:25.805 --> 00:12:28.806\nsee it on other people's\nstatuses right up there.\n\n239\n00:12:28.806 --> 00:12:30.997\nYou can change that.\n\n240\n00:12:30.997 --> 00:12:34.828\nRonnie went away and you actually\nchanged your status to Off Work, right?\n\n241\n00:12:34.828 --> 00:12:35.610\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n242\n00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.960\n&gt;&gt; And it looks like to me it says Away.\n\n243\n00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.860\nOkay, just keep that in mind,\nbut that does kinda work there.\n\n244\n00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:47.832\nThe busy,\nI think that's somewhat self-explainable,\n\n245\n00:12:47.832 --> 00:12:51.287\nis that like, hey, I'm gonna be busy.\n\n246\n00:12:51.287 --> 00:12:54.168\nAnd I don't need you to bother me.\n\n247\n00:12:54.168 --> 00:12:58.776\nBut I do wanna point out right here,\nit will revert\n\n248\n00:12:58.776 --> 00:13:04.698\nback to your Outlook calendar\nsetting in 24 hours.\n\n249\n00:13:04.698 --> 00:13:08.759\nSo that whole thing that I\ncan override my settings.\n\n250\n00:13:08.759 --> 00:13:12.776\nOf like, hey, I'm busy and\nI'm doing it in Skype.\n\n251\n00:13:12.776 --> 00:13:16.745\nWell, give it another 24 hours and\nOutlook's gonna kick in and\n\n252\n00:13:16.745 --> 00:13:20.220\ndetermine your status because\nthat's just how it does.\n\n253\n00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:24.280\nSo just keep that in mind when you're\nsetting these different things.\n\n254\n00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:30.067\nNow these different ones in the in a call,\nin a meeting, in a conference call,\n\n255\n00:13:30.067 --> 00:13:36.141\nyou can see these are specific Skype for\nbusiness activities that are happening.\n\n256\n00:13:36.141 --> 00:13:38.318\nI am in an actual phone activity.\n\n257\n00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:42.224\nI'm in a two-way audio conference call or\njust call, sorry, and\n\n258\n00:13:42.224 --> 00:13:44.820\nthat that's what I'm doing here in Skype.\n\n259\n00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:50.539\nSo don't try to IM me, or don't try\nto call me cuz I'm already in one.\n\n260\n00:13:50.539 --> 00:13:55.247\nSo those are not necessarily\ntied to your Outlook, per se.\n\n261\n00:13:55.247 --> 00:13:58.119\nIt's more within your\nactivity within Skype.\n\n262\n00:13:58.119 --> 00:13:59.990\nSo you'll see those different things,\nand and\n\n263\n00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.732\nI have seen these especially with Marisha.\n\n264\n00:14:01.732 --> 00:14:06.263\nCuz I know that she uses Skype\nfrequently to do calls and meetings and\n\n265\n00:14:06.263 --> 00:14:07.623\ndifferent things.\n\n266\n00:14:07.623 --> 00:14:11.796\nSo I see that in her status more\nthan anybody else within our\n\n267\n00:14:11.796 --> 00:14:13.680\norganization that I use.\n\n268\n00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.972\nCuz yeah, I'm showing you how I use Skype\nwithin JT, but I have my own Skype.\n\n269\n00:14:17.972 --> 00:14:22.038\nWe talk all the time because we're not in\nthe same room, so we like to chat a lot.\n\n270\n00:14:22.038 --> 00:14:23.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most of the time,\n\n271\n00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.700\nespecially with these that Devon is\njust mentioning in the last minute or\n\n272\n00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.610\nso, it really depends on\nthe way that Skype is set up.\n\n273\n00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.070\nSo for example,\nsince she mentioned Marisha and\n\n274\n00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.880\nhow many times she's seen this,\nif Marisha ends up picking up her phone,\n\n275\n00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.690\nwhich is connected to Skype for\nBusiness, more than likely,\n\n276\n00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:44.570\nit automatically changes this particular\nstatus to show that she's in a call.\n\n277\n00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:47.960\nAnd then when she hangs up, to show that\nshe's actually out of a call as well.\n\n278\n00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:53.369\nSo it's not necessarily one that we choose\nto set as much as Skype kind of saying,\n\n279\n00:14:53.369 --> 00:14:55.637\nI notice you're on the phone here.\n\n280\n00:14:55.637 --> 00:14:59.558\nLet me go ahead and set your status so\nthat that way Ronnie doesn't interrupt\n\n281\n00:14:59.558 --> 00:15:03.123\nyou in your call as he looks at Skype for\nBusiness to be able to do this.\n\n282\n00:15:03.123 --> 00:15:05.200\nSo it should be very helpful.\n\n283\n00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.153\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely, and\nlike you said, in ITProTV and\n\n284\n00:15:09.153 --> 00:15:14.770\nMarisha specifically,\nshe has a phone call versus an audio call.\n\n285\n00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.230\nWe talked about that in our introduction\njust saying there is a difference between\n\n286\n00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:23.510\nhaving a dedicated phone line rather than\njust using Skype to do an audio call.\n\n287\n00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.210\nSo different statuses\nthat go on with that.\n\n288\n00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.470\nYou also have the Do Not Disturb.\n\n289\n00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:35.440\nNow with Do Not Disturb, this is one that,\nit's a little bit more than busy.\n\n290\n00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.240\nA Do Not Disturb, this also ties\nin with what type of privacy\n\n291\n00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.080\nrelationship that you\nhave with that contact.\n\n292\n00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.301\nWe'll give you a little bit more\ninformation about that in another episode.\n\n293\n00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:50.582\nBut Do Not Disturb means\npeople are being blocked.\n\n294\n00:15:50.582 --> 00:15:51.223\nIt is like,\n\n295\n00:15:51.223 --> 00:15:55.333\nthey're gonna get a busy signal if you\nwanna say kinda tying it back to a phone\n\n296\n00:15:55.333 --> 00:15:59.443\nline of you're not gonna get through to\nthem It will show up when you IM them or\n\n297\n00:15:59.443 --> 00:16:04.200\neverything like, nope they've put Do Not\nDisturb, you have to contact them later.\n\n298\n00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.700\nOr it will go into I believe it's\nin their missed conversations.\n\n299\n00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.200\nAnd so it's almost like an answer\nmachine if you wanna say,\n\n300\n00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.910\nI'll talk more about that too.\n\n301\n00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:18.010\nBut there are certain people that\ncould get through your do not disturb\n\n302\n00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:19.210\nif you allow them.\n\n303\n00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:23.960\nYou have to say hey, this person's\nat a specific relationship with me,\n\n304\n00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.520\nthat if I have Do Not Disturb and\nthey IM me it will still come through.\n\n305\n00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.343\nIt doesn't mean I have to answer it,\nbut it will come through.\n\n306\n00:16:31.343 --> 00:16:36.215\nAnd this is another one that says\nit will revert back to your Outlook\n\n307\n00:16:36.215 --> 00:16:39.262\ncalendar status within that 24 hours.\n\n308\n00:16:39.262 --> 00:16:47.300\nSo just be aware of that and who can and\ncannot get through your Do Not Disturb.\n\n309\n00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:52.690\nThere’s also a few settings with that Do\nNot Disturb that are in your options here\n\n310\n00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.390\nthat are noteworthy.\n\n311\n00:16:55.390 --> 00:17:01.210\nIf we go to I believe it’s in your\nstatus right here, and as I can\n\n312\n00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:05.410\nsee we briefly mentioned this, I only want\npeople in contacts to see my presence.\n\n313\n00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.490\nI don't necessarily want everybody,\n\n314\n00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:11.370\nthe whole big Skype world\nto see what my presence is.\n\n315\n00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:14.780\nThe other one's right here, Show me as\nDo Not Disturb when I share my desktop.\n\n316\n00:17:15.895 --> 00:17:19.940\nCuz that would be one if I'm\nsharing my desktop with you and\n\n317\n00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:25.990\nit pops up that your nemesis is contacting\nme you might not wanna see that.\n\n318\n00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.462\nCuz that's something I\ndon't want Ronnie to see.\n\n319\n00:17:29.462 --> 00:17:32.600\nSo putting that Do Not Disturb\nwould be on share my desktop.\n\n320\n00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.781\nNow if that nemesis is in my special list\nthey can get through that [SOUND] you\n\n321\n00:17:36.781 --> 00:17:39.354\ngotta be careful about\nsome of those things.\n\n322\n00:17:39.354 --> 00:17:43.250\nAnother one is Do Not Disturb\nwhen my monitor is duplicated.\n\n323\n00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:46.775\nMaybe you are doing a presentation,\n\n324\n00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:50.140\nyou're in another call so\nthat's something that you want to go.\n\n325\n00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.510\nThat is not checked on by default so\n\n326\n00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:57.720\njust make sure that you do know that those\nare there if you wanted to change that.\n\n327\n00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.330\n&gt;&gt; And that's actually more important than\nwe realize especially this day in age of\n\n328\n00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:05.330\ncollaboration And that's because if\nwe start sharing out our desktop,\n\n329\n00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:09.200\nif we start to do a presentation\nof some sort, right?\n\n330\n00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.038\nThis is something that if it's duplicated,\nwhat we don't want is a personal\n\n331\n00:18:13.038 --> 00:18:15.822\nconversation to essentially show up and\nthere you are.\n\n332\n00:18:15.822 --> 00:18:19.657\nYou're in a room of let's say a couple\nhundred people and there it is,\n\n333\n00:18:19.657 --> 00:18:21.682\na little personal message shows up.\n\n334\n00:18:21.682 --> 00:18:24.971\nAnd you have to go,\nI'm sorry that didn't mean to pop up.\n\n335\n00:18:24.971 --> 00:18:29.283\nSo this allows you to just say if\nyou see this type of setting Skype,\n\n336\n00:18:29.283 --> 00:18:32.057\nthen go ahead and\njust set this in this way.\n\n337\n00:18:32.057 --> 00:18:34.490\nWhere that message shouldn't pop up and\ncome through.\n\n338\n00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.532\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and the privacy relationships,\n\n339\n00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:39.477\nyou might wanna set all of\nthat before you do anything.\n\n340\n00:18:39.477 --> 00:18:40.106\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH].\n\n341\n00:18:40.106 --> 00:18:42.986\n&gt;&gt; So that nobody gets through\nyour Do Not Disturb, and\n\n342\n00:18:42.986 --> 00:18:45.220\nI'll show you how to change all of that.\n\n343\n00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:49.140\nNow let's look at some other\npresence the Out of Office.\n\n344\n00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:54.302\nNow this is something that is tied\nto your Outlook calendar, and\n\n345\n00:18:54.302 --> 00:18:59.384\nif you go ahead and set up your\nOut of Office automatic replies.\n\n346\n00:18:59.384 --> 00:19:04.942\nIt will alert people of that and\nthat was one that I believe,\n\n347\n00:19:04.942 --> 00:19:07.845\ndid I put Joey on Out of Office?\n\n348\n00:19:07.845 --> 00:19:09.052\nI can't remember if I did.\n\n349\n00:19:09.052 --> 00:19:09.628\n&gt;&gt; Let me see.\n\n350\n00:19:09.628 --> 00:19:12.560\n&gt;&gt; I thought I put it for\n3:30, but I might not have.\n\n351\n00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.407\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No, okay well that's okay.\n\n352\n00:19:14.407 --> 00:19:17.458\n[LAUGH] I thought I had set something\nup to where you would be able to\n\n353\n00:19:17.458 --> 00:19:20.520\nsee that Joey is out of the office so\nthat you can see that status.\n\n354\n00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:25.662\nBut it is nice that you can see the icons\nright here in our website that will\n\n355\n00:19:25.662 --> 00:19:30.490\ngo ahead and tie that into your Skype and\nyour Outlook Out of Office.\n\n356\n00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:33.890\nSo they'll know, hey I'm not here.\n\n357\n00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:38.150\nIt's not just that I'm offline,\nI am out of the office,\n\n358\n00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:41.530\nwhich again is right into I'm Offline.\n\n359\n00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.590\nI am not signed in to my Skype account.\n\n360\n00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:51.370\nSo you can see right here that in\nI believe me, okay my Vonne Smith,\n\n361\n00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:57.060\nmy ITPro account I'm not online\nbecause I'm not signed in.\n\n362\n00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.556\nSo my status is I'm completely Offline.\n\n363\n00:20:00.556 --> 00:20:04.649\nAnd there's also the unknown,\n[LAUGH] into the big unknown.\n\n364\n00:20:04.649 --> 00:20:07.220\nYour presence cannot be detected.\n\n365\n00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.380\nSo you can see that might be that\npeople are not using Skype for\n\n366\n00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.250\nBusiness as their instant\nmessaging program.\n\n367\n00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:18.430\nWell the thing is like this one\nright here, my good friend Tiffany I\n\n368\n00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.210\nknow this works and\nshe uses Skype for Business.\n\n369\n00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:23.710\nWhy is her presence unknown?\n\n370\n00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:29.225\nThis goes back to all of the settings\nthat your network administrators\n\n371\n00:20:29.225 --> 00:20:34.095\ncan go ahead and establish within\nthe university of Florida.\n\n372\n00:20:34.095 --> 00:20:36.585\nThey lock things down over there.\n\n373\n00:20:36.585 --> 00:20:41.501\nSo people outside the organization\naren't going to be able to kinda\n\n374\n00:20:41.501 --> 00:20:43.233\nsee in if you wanna say.\n\n375\n00:20:43.233 --> 00:20:45.351\nAnd be able to communicate and\n\n376\n00:20:45.351 --> 00:20:49.681\nI'll demonstrate this even\nfurther when we get into the IM.\n\n377\n00:20:49.681 --> 00:20:50.911\nBut I know she uses it.\n\n378\n00:20:50.911 --> 00:20:54.886\nSo just know that that presence unknown,\ncould be that it doesn't exist.\n\n379\n00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:59.697\nCuz we can still add contacts\nthat don't ever have anybody\n\n380\n00:20:59.697 --> 00:21:04.420\non the receiving line or\ntheir network won't let you in.\n\n381\n00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.802\nAnd there's always some\nother weird nuances,\n\n382\n00:21:07.802 --> 00:21:11.520\nlike we're all in the same organization,\nbut their presence is unknown.\n\n383\n00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:14.739\nWe always talk about the gremlins\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n384\n00:21:14.739 --> 00:21:17.366\n&gt;&gt; There's always those weird settings,\nbut\n\n385\n00:21:17.366 --> 00:21:20.920\nif you can still communicate\nwith them like you can IM them.\n\n386\n00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.990\nYou can audio chat them and\ntheir presence is unknown.\n\n387\n00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.743\nIt's one of those I hate to say it,\nyou kinda just have to live with it and\n\n388\n00:21:27.743 --> 00:21:30.570\njust be like hey are you there,\ndon't get anything.\n\n389\n00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:31.903\nAll right I guess you're not there.\n\n390\n00:21:31.903 --> 00:21:35.889\n[LAUGH] One of those, so\ndifferent ways of our statuses and\n\n391\n00:21:35.889 --> 00:21:41.630\nthen we could go ahead and we've seen\nsome of the ones that have changed.\n\n392\n00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:46.499\nNow the thing that popped up\nthat we kinda maybe blipped is\n\n393\n00:21:46.499 --> 00:21:50.260\nyou can tag somebody for\na change of status.\n\n394\n00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:55.976\nAnd that's what I did for JT,\nI tagged Marisha for her status change.\n\n395\n00:21:55.976 --> 00:21:57.356\nBecause I know she's in and\n\n396\n00:21:57.356 --> 00:22:00.426\nout like always kind of doing\nall sorts of different things.\n\n397\n00:22:00.426 --> 00:22:05.590\nSo I can get a little alert when\nsomebody's status has changed.\n\n398\n00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.270\nSo let's go how about Ronnie, right?\n\n399\n00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:11.653\nI will tag you for a status change alert.\n\n400\n00:22:11.653 --> 00:22:16.413\nSo on my end, that me as JT I\nwanna see what's gonna happen.\n\n401\n00:22:16.413 --> 00:22:19.967\nSo let's also go ahead and\nchange your status and\n\n402\n00:22:19.967 --> 00:22:23.011\nlet's take me of the screen for a second.\n\n403\n00:22:23.011 --> 00:22:27.446\nSo we can see it happen in that bottom\nright hand corner is that I've gone ahead\n\n404\n00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:30.100\nand you set it to busy, right?\n\n405\n00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:34.925\nSo now you should be able to go ahead and\nset it back to available Ronnie.\n\n406\n00:22:34.925 --> 00:22:38.229\n[SOUND] There,\nthat's what I was looking for.\n\n407\n00:22:38.229 --> 00:22:39.996\nSo you can see that I have tagged,\n\n408\n00:22:39.996 --> 00:22:42.660\nnotice it didn't tag me\nwhen you were busy did it?\n\n409\n00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.550\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; It only tagged me when you became\n\n410\n00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.060\navailable again.\n\n411\n00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.903\nSo that's something that hey\nif you're kinda waiting for\n\n412\n00:22:49.903 --> 00:22:51.536\nthe boss to get out of the office.\n\n413\n00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:54.358\n&gt;&gt; Well actually out of a meeting so\nyou could talk to them,\n\n414\n00:22:54.358 --> 00:22:55.809\nlet's switch that around.\n\n415\n00:22:55.809 --> 00:22:57.639\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You could go ahead and tag for\n\n416\n00:22:57.639 --> 00:22:59.659\ntheir status of when\nthey become available.\n\n417\n00:22:59.659 --> 00:23:03.600\nYou'll get a little pop up and it will\nlet you know that that's what's going on.\n\n418\n00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.570\nSo that's how you can go ahead and\ntag people.\n\n419\n00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:12.375\nSo lots of different things that\nwe can see within our status.\n\n420\n00:23:12.375 --> 00:23:16.770\nTalked about those options that we went\nover of when you want to go ahead and\n\n421\n00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:22.098\ndetermine when your Skype shows\nyou as inactive and, or away.\n\n422\n00:23:22.098 --> 00:23:26.000\nOn how many minutes you become\nidle on your computer or\n\n423\n00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.020\nnot using it, and\nthen that Do Not Disturb.\n\n424\n00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.435\nAgain remember those reverts,\n\n425\n00:23:32.435 --> 00:23:40.500\nBusy and Do Not Disturb,\nthat's what I was trying to do.\n\n426\n00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:44.760\nIt will reset itself in 24 hours,\nso if you're relying on that for\n\n427\n00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.920\nmultiple days, just watch it.\n\n428\n00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.460\nBecause all of these different reasons\nof why you have your contacts and\n\n429\n00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:56.190\nwhy you wanna look for\ntheir status is kind of important.\n\n430\n00:23:56.190 --> 00:24:01.830\nAnd we'll take this one step further\nwith our privacy settings or\n\n431\n00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:08.330\nrelationships to see how much I can and\ncannot see with our different things.\n\n432\n00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:12.210\nSo I believe we're gonna go ahead and stop\nright there Ronnie, with our status and\n\n433\n00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:12.750\noptions.\n\n434\n00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:16.088\nAnd like I said we'll come back with\njust a little bit more with contacts.\n\n435\n00:24:16.088 --> 00:24:19.120\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne, thank you again for\nhelping us to understand\n\n436\n00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:23.740\nthose different status messages that\nwe see in Skype a little bit better.\n\n437\n00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:28.085\nAnd also seeing that even though we can\nchange them on the fly when we need to.\n\n438\n00:24:28.085 --> 00:24:32.635\nThere are some of those particular\nstatuses that we may end up seeing that\n\n439\n00:24:32.635 --> 00:24:35.405\nare due to the fact that\nwe have a phone call.\n\n440\n00:24:35.405 --> 00:24:39.330\nOr that we may also be in a presentation,\nwe may be sharing our screen.\n\n441\n00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.749\nThese are things that Skype for\nBusiness is gonna pick up automatically.\n\n442\n00:24:42.749 --> 00:24:47.013\nAnd help us out to allow for other\npeople to see what status that we are.\n\n443\n00:24:47.013 --> 00:24:50.145\nAnd that way they won't disturb us in\nthe middle of an important phone call, or\n\n444\n00:24:50.145 --> 00:24:51.243\nduring the presentation.\n\n445\n00:24:51.243 --> 00:24:54.767\nOr something that we really say l\nneed to spend some time here and\n\n446\n00:24:54.767 --> 00:24:57.242\nl'll get back to them\na little bit later on.\n\n447\n00:24:57.242 --> 00:25:00.175\nAll right Vonne well that's\na great place for us to end.\n\n448\n00:25:00.175 --> 00:25:03.212\nBut before we do any last words for\neverybody watching?\n\n449\n00:25:03.212 --> 00:25:06.827\n&gt;&gt; I think this is gonna be the moral of\nthe story here with Skype for Business.\n\n450\n00:25:06.827 --> 00:25:09.605\nIs there's always gonna be some\nweird nuances that's gonna come up.\n\n451\n00:25:09.605 --> 00:25:12.603\nThat it's gonna be like I can't see this,\n\n452\n00:25:12.603 --> 00:25:16.865\nI honestly have no reason why but\nit just happens sometimes.\n\n453\n00:25:16.865 --> 00:25:21.372\nSo you hate to kinda throw that out, of\nlike this is how it's supposed to work but\n\n454\n00:25:21.372 --> 00:25:22.825\nif it doesn't, sorry.\n\n455\n00:25:22.825 --> 00:25:26.500\n[LAUGH] It does,\nit's the nature of computers.\n\n456\n00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.712\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell that is a world wide system and\n\n457\n00:25:28.712 --> 00:25:30.560\nwe do have to deal with it as well.\n\n458\n00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.120\nBut it is a great place for\nus to sign off.\n\n459\n00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.330\nFor OfficeProTV I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n460\n00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:37.300\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n461\n00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.900\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here

00:00:18.290\nYou're watching the Skype for\nBusiness show.\n\n4\n00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.830\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.310\nAnd today we're gonna be taking\na look at contact cards and\n\n6\n00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.370\nour privacy relationships\ninside of Skype For Business.\n\n7\n00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.284\nAnd here to help us out, of course, is\nour, well, Office Pro prodigy herself, Ms.\n\n8\n00:00:31.284 --> 00:00:32.195\nVonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:33.840\nVonne, welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.600\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, prodigy.\n\n11\n00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.490\n&gt;&gt; That's right, prodigy.\n\n12\n00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.220\n&gt;&gt; That's a new one [LAUGH].\n\n13\n00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes, all right, so Vonne, here it is.\n\n14\n00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.640\nWe've gotten to be able to play\nwith the status a little bit.\n\n15\n00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.750\nWe've also added contacts in.\n\n16\n00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.810\nWe were able to find them.\n\n17\n00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.660\nWe've gotten everything set\nup the way that we want to.\n\n18\n00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.240\nBut now we're moving into this realm\nof contact cards of relationships.\n\n19\n00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.280\nWhat's that all about, Vonne?\n\n20\n00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.600\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nwe have a contact card.\n\n21\n00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.410\nIt's kinda like your business card,\nif you wanna say.\n\n22\n00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.160\nIt's one of those things that you\ncan go ahead and make for yourself.\n\n23\n00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.010\nWell, actually, do you know about\nthe business card in Outlook?\n\n24\n00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.061\n&gt;&gt; A little bit, yes,\nI know exactly what that is.\n\n25\n00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:13.959\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so that's where you\ncould go ahead and create your,\n\n26\n00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:16.518\nit's like your own contact\nwithin your contacts.\n\n27\n00:01:16.518 --> 00:01:22.500\nAnd then you can attach it to your\nOutlook signature as a business card.\n\n28\n00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.159\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And that's one of those virtual VCFs,\n\n29\n00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.770\nthe different file formulas you can do.\n\n30\n00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.299\nSo it´s similar, it´s kinda like that.\n\n31\n00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.349\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n32\n00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:32.431\n&gt;&gt; And it´s kinda not [LAUGH].\n\n33\n00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:34.387\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know how it always goes.\n\n34\n00:01:34.387 --> 00:01:35.210\n&gt;&gt; Sure, why not.\n\n35\n00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n36\n00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.750\nSo it´s the information that\nyou can see on your contact.\n\n37\n00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.350\nBut it has a lot of nuances about it.\n\n38\n00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.519\nIs it an internal contact\nwithin your network?.\n\n39\n00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:52.267\nIf it's in your network,\n\n40\n00:01:52.267 --> 00:01:56.972\nthen those people are all in your\nwhat I remember as Active Directory.\n\n41\n00:01:56.972 --> 00:01:58.946\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right, within your organization.\n\n42\n00:01:58.946 --> 00:02:04.166\nAll of the users that is controlled by\nyour Office 365 network administrators and\n\n43\n00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:07.337\nthings like that, so\nwe're all in the same place.\n\n44\n00:02:07.337 --> 00:02:12.662\nSo we can see a lot more information\nabout each other because of what\n\n45\n00:02:12.662 --> 00:02:17.812\nis set at the top level and\nhow we can all kind of see that, right.\n\n46\n00:02:17.812 --> 00:02:20.776\nYou get into external contacts.\n\n47\n00:02:20.776 --> 00:02:22.993\nWell, they're not in your network,\n\n48\n00:02:22.993 --> 00:02:26.266\nso you're not gonna be able\nto see maybe nearly as much.\n\n49\n00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:31.003\nAnd their network administrators, or\nhowever they go ahead and determine their\n\n50\n00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:35.753\norganization, determines what people\noutside of their organization can see.\n\n51\n00:02:35.753 --> 00:02:36.280\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo\n\n52\n00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.770\nthat's why I say it all is very dependent\non all of these different nuances.\n\n53\n00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.371\nSo you might see a contact card for\none of your people in Skype,\n\n54\n00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:49.927\nall sorts of stuff,\nprobably an internal one.\n\n55\n00:02:49.927 --> 00:02:54.459\nYou go to somebody who's an external\ncontact, you just might see their email.\n\n56\n00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.323\nYou might not see their address and\ntheir different phone numbers and\n\n57\n00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:00.129\nall of those different things.\n\n58\n00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.170\nThen there's a whole other level\nthat gets into it is what is\n\n59\n00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.657\nthe privacy relationship that that\nperson has established with you?\n\n60\n00:03:11.657 --> 00:03:15.737\nAnd that's something that we've kind\nof mentioned throughout these different\n\n61\n00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:18.324\nepisodes when we're talking\nabout our contacts.\n\n62\n00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:20.960\nAnd it does make a difference.\n\n63\n00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.690\nAnd, especially, remember we were talking\nabout in the last episode, if you're\n\n64\n00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.700\nwatching in succession, we were talking\nabout the status and the options episode.\n\n65\n00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.700\nWe talked about that out of office status.\n\n66\n00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.991\nAnd we couldn't get it to really work,\nremember, right?\n\n67\n00:03:35.991 --> 00:03:37.461\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\nAnd I had said, wait,\n\n68\n00:03:37.461 --> 00:03:39.409\nI thought I set Joey as an out of office.\n\n69\n00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.137\nAnd I'm like, well,\nit still says he's available.\n\n70\n00:03:42.137 --> 00:03:48.360\nAnd we kind of went back and forth on\nthat one and, well, [LAUGH] guess what?\n\n71\n00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.730\nThere's another aspect that we forgot\nto set in all of these settings,\n\n72\n00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.060\nand it's directly tied to\nthe privacy relationships.\n\n73\n00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.040\nI'm gonna pull all that up, so\nit's gonna come full circle\n\n74\n00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.830\nwith the out of office status and\nthe different things you can do.\n\n75\n00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.820\nSo let's go ahead and jump on into it.\n\n76\n00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.479\nYou can see I've got my Skype for\nBusiness up.\n\n77\n00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:14.603\nI've got a couple of people\nthat are either away, or\n\n78\n00:04:14.603 --> 00:04:17.238\nunavailable, or those different things.\n\n79\n00:04:17.238 --> 00:04:18.675\nYou can see their statuses.\n\n80\n00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:21.610\n[LAUGH] All right, contact cards.\n\n81\n00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.930\nIf I went ahead and went to Joey.\n\n82\n00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.838\nNow, Joey right now is\nin my internal contacts.\n\n83\n00:04:27.838 --> 00:04:31.270\nIf I right-click on him and\ngo to See Contact Card,\n\n84\n00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.660\nI believe you can hover over their\npicture and then come to here.\n\n85\n00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.050\nOr is it that one?\n\n86\n00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.212\nIs that the contact card?\n\n87\n00:04:38.212 --> 00:04:38.919\n&gt;&gt; I believe it is.\n\n88\n00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.063\n&gt;&gt; I believe, so okay, good [LAUGH].\n\n89\n00:04:41.063 --> 00:04:43.790\nI was looking for\nthe hover to put the little tool tip up.\n\n90\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.910\nCuz, honestly, I usually just right-click,\nthen do the See Contact Card.\n\n91\n00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.230\nSo notice in Joey, and\n\n92\n00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.060\nI'm kinda grabbing by the top,\nI can see a lot of stuff in here.\n\n93\n00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.840\nI can see, all right,\nwell he's obviously an Outlook contact.\n\n94\n00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.720\nHe's got a mobile number in there,\nsome notes in here.\n\n95\n00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.080\nThere's an organization.\n\n96\n00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.200\nThere's memberships.\n\n97\n00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.212\nLook at the memberships\nthat he has right here.\n\n98\n00:05:07.212 --> 00:05:09.680\nAnd these are the ones that\nwe have with groups, right.\n\n99\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.414\nCuz I think I made the reunion tour.\n\n100\n00:05:11.414 --> 00:05:13.560\nI think you made the IT tier one?\n\n101\n00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.310\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; In one of your episodes.\n\n102\n00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.623\nSo I see a lot of different\nthings with Joey's contact card.\n\n103\n00:05:20.623 --> 00:05:22.203\nHe's an internal contact.\n\n104\n00:05:22.203 --> 00:05:27.395\nIf I go to Marisha's contact card,\nright-click, that's all I see.\n\n105\n00:05:27.395 --> 00:05:31.800\n[LAUGH] I don't really see much\nmore than that, except her email.\n\n106\n00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.713\nI see something about a calendar.\n\n107\n00:05:33.713 --> 00:05:37.568\nAnd, of course, I still have my other\nbuttons here for more ways that\n\n108\n00:05:37.568 --> 00:05:41.570\nyou could go ahead and IM the person or\ncall them, and so on and so forth.\n\n109\n00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:49.290\nSo, again, internal and external contacts\nare what we can see on the contact card.\n\n110\n00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.060\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Vonne,\nlet me ask a question.\n\n111\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.170\nWhere is this information\nbeing pulled from?\n\n112\n00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.570\nIs this something when I sign in\nto Skype that I need to set up?\n\n113\n00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.060\nOr is this actually pulling\nfrom my Office 365 account?\n\n114\n00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.175\n&gt;&gt; It's pulling from your account,\nbut it's also really their account.\n\n115\n00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:06.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's what it's showing.\n\n116\n00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.966\nAnd, again, those privacy settings, as to\nwhat they've determined of what I can see,\n\n117\n00:06:10.966 --> 00:06:12.928\nthat's on them.\n\n118\n00:06:12.928 --> 00:06:13.833\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n119\n00:06:13.833 --> 00:06:16.550\nYou, for example, not me.\n\n120\n00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.880\nI can go ahead and set all sorts\nof different relationships, but\n\n121\n00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.650\nthat's how I am dealing with them.\n\n122\n00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.910\nTurn it around, right?\n\n123\n00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.710\nYou set it how you're dealing with me.\n\n124\n00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.760\nOkay, and we could go ahead and\nestablish that.\n\n125\n00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.327\nSo we'll come back to\nthat in just a second.\n\n126\n00:06:32.327 --> 00:06:36.444\nBut the other thing I wanted to\npoint out with those contact cards,\n\n127\n00:06:36.444 --> 00:06:40.135\nif I bring up Joey's,\nyou see this button right over here.\n\n128\n00:06:40.135 --> 00:06:43.094\nIt says Edit contact.\n\n129\n00:06:43.094 --> 00:06:44.043\nIs that mine?\n\n130\n00:06:44.043 --> 00:06:46.750\nLet's come over here to Marisha's contact.\n\n131\n00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.342\nIt says Add, hm.\n\n132\n00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:53.890\nWell, this is because Joey\nis my Outlook contact.\n\n133\n00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:59.740\nMarisha is not my Outlook contact,\ntwo separate places.\n\n134\n00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.875\nSo if I wanted, if I've been talking\nto Marisha through Skype and\n\n135\n00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:08.611\nI wanna add her into my Outlook contacts\ncuz I just want her over in my Outlook\n\n136\n00:07:08.611 --> 00:07:12.245\ncontacts [LAUGH], I could go ahead and\nclick that button.\n\n137\n00:07:12.245 --> 00:07:16.914\nNotice that it's bringing up some\nthings that I can then add more\n\n138\n00:07:16.914 --> 00:07:19.686\ninformation into it that I want to do.\n\n139\n00:07:19.686 --> 00:07:24.979\nAnd we've talked about this in our Outlook\nshows is that a global address list,\n\n140\n00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:26.007\nyou have your.\n\n141\n00:07:26.007 --> 00:07:27.975\nWe just talked about the Active Directory,\nright.\n\n142\n00:07:27.975 --> 00:07:30.135\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; Internally it has all this information.\n\n143\n00:07:30.135 --> 00:07:36.858\nBut maybe I wanna add some more stuff in\nmy local contacts, my set of contacts.\n\n144\n00:07:36.858 --> 00:07:39.428\nNot my global addresses,\nmy contacts in Outlook.\n\n145\n00:07:39.428 --> 00:07:41.762\nTo add things like maybe a birthday or\n\n146\n00:07:41.762 --> 00:07:45.904\ndifferent levels of notes that I\nneed to know that this particular\n\n147\n00:07:45.904 --> 00:07:49.690\nperson is more than just what\nthe global address list says.\n\n148\n00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.307\nAnd this is the same kind of idea.\n\n149\n00:07:52.307 --> 00:07:56.850\nI can add in more information into my\nOutlook contacts rather than my Skype\n\n150\n00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:57.590\ncontacts.\n\n151\n00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:02.719\nAnd, notice, I can just say Work address,\nand I'll just say, IT Pro.\n\n152\n00:08:02.719 --> 00:08:06.705\nAnd we'll just put Gainesville in here and\npretend I can.\n\n153\n00:08:06.705 --> 00:08:07.865\nOo, whoa, that's really bad.\n\n154\n00:08:07.865 --> 00:08:09.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's pretend I typed\n\n155\n00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.374\nthat in, right?\n\n156\n00:08:10.374 --> 00:08:12.120\nAnd we'll go ahead and save.\n\n157\n00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.455\nAny time I do the address, it's always\ngonna do that check and everything.\n\n158\n00:08:16.455 --> 00:08:17.760\nWe'll just do, that's okay.\n\n159\n00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.951\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n160\n00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:21.302\n&gt;&gt; For now, for these purposes,\n\n161\n00:08:21.302 --> 00:08:22.753\nlet's save that.\n\n162\n00:08:22.753 --> 00:08:27.387\nAnd now notice I have more information,\nthat's me on my end,\n\n163\n00:08:27.387 --> 00:08:29.530\nnot what I got from her.\n\n164\n00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.850\nSo those are the different things that\nyou can do from your contact card, and\n\n165\n00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.480\nthen how it ties in with your Outlook.\n\n166\n00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.270\nAnother thing you could do,\nlike if I wanted to take Joey and\n\n167\n00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.440\nsee the contact card.\n\n168\n00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.410\nThere is this little button right here,\nthis pin contact card,\n\n169\n00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.490\nwhich basically what that\nmeans is it just stays open.\n\n170\n00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:52.590\nSo I can come over to Marisha, or\ndifferent things, I could be IM'ing and so\n\n171\n00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.768\non and so forth, but\nthat's just going to stay pinned.\n\n172\n00:08:54.768 --> 00:08:57.280\nIf I unpin it and then click\n\n173\n00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.450\nout into my Skype Business notices\nthat it goes ahead and closes it out.\n\n174\n00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:07.470\nSo that's what that pin means and the edit\nand the add button, how that changes.\n\n175\n00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.123\nHey everyone, Vonne here.\n\n176\n00:09:09.123 --> 00:09:12.404\nHere to interrupt our program because\nif you've been watching so far and\n\n177\n00:09:12.404 --> 00:09:13.874\nthinking, hm, you know what?\n\n178\n00:09:13.874 --> 00:09:18.770\nMy contact cards don't look anything\nlike that, well, I'm here to explain why\n\n179\n00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.660\nthat is, and give you a little\nbit of a background information.\n\n180\n00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.580\nSo why don't we go ahead and take a look.\n\n181\n00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.869\nSo we have Justin's computer.\n\n182\n00:09:25.869 --> 00:09:27.764\nI'm actually on a different computer.\n\n183\n00:09:27.764 --> 00:09:31.277\nBut it really all comes\ndown to the versions,\n\n184\n00:09:31.277 --> 00:09:35.355\nabout the updates that\nhappen in our Office 365.\n\n185\n00:09:35.355 --> 00:09:38.821\nSo in this version of Justin and\nthe computer that I'm on,\n\n186\n00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:42.779\nif we go up here to my Help,\nyou can always tell what version of any of\n\n187\n00:09:42.779 --> 00:09:47.762\nthe Office products you're on by going up\nup into the Help and going into the About.\n\n188\n00:09:47.762 --> 00:09:53.099\nAnd notice right here that it says\nthat we're on a 16.0.7927 and\n\n189\n00:09:53.099 --> 00:09:55.002\na whole bunch of numbers.\n\n190\n00:09:55.002 --> 00:09:56.490\nAll right, so take note of that.\n\n191\n00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.930\nAnd if I look here,\ncome into Joey's contact card,\n\n192\n00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.758\nlike we were doing just in our\nregularly scheduled program,\n\n193\n00:10:01.758 --> 00:10:04.150\nyou can see that everything\nlooks just like it was.\n\n194\n00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.740\nWe have these little tabs\nacross the bottom that go into\n\n195\n00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.870\nthe organization and the notes.\n\n196\n00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.040\nAnd as you've been seeing,\nthe Edit or the Add button,\n\n197\n00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.700\ndepending on whether they're\nalready in our contacts or not.\n\n198\n00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.830\nWell, then let's jump over\nhere to another computer,\n\n199\n00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.270\nanother virtual machine\nthat I have on here.\n\n200\n00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.850\nLet's come over here to Joey's account.\n\n201\n00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:33.400\nAnd if I look to the Help and go to there,\nthe Help menu, there it is, 16.0.873.\n\n202\n00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:40.214\nSo this is a newer version,\na newer update than Justin's account.\n\n203\n00:10:40.214 --> 00:10:44.549\nSo if I look here on the contact card for\nJustin Timberlake, remember we're in\n\n204\n00:10:44.549 --> 00:10:49.167\nJoey's account, I gotta see contact card,\nit doesn't look anything like that.\n\n205\n00:10:49.167 --> 00:10:53.089\nIt looks similar, but\nenough to maybe throw you off to be like,\n\n206\n00:10:53.089 --> 00:10:57.240\nI don't know where that edit button is or\nwhere that add button is.\n\n207\n00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.940\nIt's not gonna hang out over\nhere on the right-hand side.\n\n208\n00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.330\nYou're gonna have to go into the dot,\ndot dot.\n\n209\n00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.980\nThis little menu right here for\nthe more options.\n\n210\n00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.510\nAnd that's where you're going to see\n\n211\n00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:12.690\nthe edit contact if it's already\nin your Outlook contacts.\n\n212\n00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.850\nOr the add button if it's not already\npart of your Outlook contacts.\n\n213\n00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:22.250\nSo that's where those buttons are going\nto exist, they're now in a little menu.\n\n214\n00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.770\nSo a little misleading on that.\n\n215\n00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:28.177\nThere are buttons over\nhere if I come back and\n\n216\n00:11:28.177 --> 00:11:31.550\nview contact card one more\ntime on JT's account.\n\n217\n00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:36.080\nSee there is that dot dot dots here,\nbut they don't have as many options.\n\n218\n00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:41.530\nThey just kinda condensed a few\nthings into those dropdown menus.\n\n219\n00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:45.420\nAnd the last thing I wanted to point out\nis back here when I was clicking on these\n\n220\n00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:50.110\nlittle tabs that go through the other\ninformation that's in that contact,\n\n221\n00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:54.460\nif you come over here,\nnotice there's no other tabs.\n\n222\n00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.310\nThey're just in these buttons down here or\nit's stacked, you could say.\n\n223\n00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:02.724\nSo if I click on organization, notice it\nwill go into the organization information.\n\n224\n00:12:02.724 --> 00:12:07.705\nBut I have to click that little back\nbutton at the top to get back to\n\n225\n00:12:07.705 --> 00:12:10.019\nthe main page of the contact.\n\n226\n00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:13.012\nAnd then you can click on membership and\nso on and so forth, so\n\n227\n00:12:13.012 --> 00:12:14.671\nthey did a little housekeeping.\n\n228\n00:12:14.671 --> 00:12:15.877\nThey kinda moved things around.\n\n229\n00:12:15.877 --> 00:12:18.819\nBut just like any time you go and\nrearrange the kitchen, you keep going for\n\n230\n00:12:18.819 --> 00:12:21.920\nthat one drawer where the forks are and\nthen the forks aren't there anymore.\n\n231\n00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.700\nSo that's what's happened here.\n\n232\n00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.980\nAnd so hopefully that gives you a little\nbit of an explanation as to why\n\n233\n00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.320\nthings might be looking different.\n\n234\n00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.175\nAlways look at your versions and\nknowing where you are.\n\n235\n00:12:31.175 --> 00:12:34.629\nAnd now we can go back to our\nregularly scheduled program.\n\n236\n00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:39.140\nAlrighty, privacy relationships.\n\n237\n00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.280\nThis is what I determine.\n\n238\n00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.279\nWe talked about this\nin the do not disturb.\n\n239\n00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:43.791\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n240\n00:12:43.791 --> 00:12:44.357\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n241\n00:12:44.357 --> 00:12:48.820\nWhere I need to set different\nlevels of who can contact me when.\n\n242\n00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.870\nI will say also this is something\nthat's a PC only thing cuz we just\n\n243\n00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:59.040\nchecked that in our Mac settings is that\nit wasn't giving you the same options.\n\n244\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.130\nSo just in case, I know this is a PC\ncentered show, if you have anybody in\n\n245\n00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:08.670\nyour organization that's not on a PC,\non a Mac, it might be a little different.\n\n246\n00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:13.770\nOkay, if I go into\nthe privacy relationships,\n\n247\n00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.525\nI'm just picking Marisha for right now.\n\n248\n00:13:15.525 --> 00:13:18.420\nNotice that we have,\nhere let me move this over so\n\n249\n00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.870\nyou can guys can see it a little better,\nwe have different levels of relationships.\n\n250\n00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:27.020\nWe have Friends and Family, Workgroup,\nColleagues, External Contacts.\n\n251\n00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.280\nThis is also where you can block contacts,\nwhich is a good thing to know about.\n\n252\n00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.550\nLike, hey, just,\nI don't want them to be able to reach me.\n\n253\n00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:38.370\nThey'll still be able to see your\ninformation, but they can't contact you.\n\n254\n00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:42.340\nI've also pulled up the website that\nis associated with these different\n\n255\n00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.070\nprivacy relationships.\n\n256\n00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:48.060\nYou can see what levels that it will do.\n\n257\n00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.600\nAnd it has this nice table of all\nthe information that it can see.\n\n258\n00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.946\nBut the nice thing in Skype\nwhen you're looking at it,\n\n259\n00:13:54.946 --> 00:13:59.263\nit actually kinda tells you what each\none of these levels is all about.\n\n260\n00:13:59.263 --> 00:14:02.657\nYou could see Friends and\nFamily, sharing my note.\n\n261\n00:14:02.657 --> 00:14:03.286\nWhat's the note?\n\n262\n00:14:03.286 --> 00:14:06.180\nThat's up here where it\nsays it's contact day.\n\n263\n00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.780\nThat's what's being shared.\n\n264\n00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:12.140\nLocation, all of my contact, but\nnot my meeting details and where I'm at.\n\n265\n00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.684\nWorkgroup, this is the one where it says\nit's just pretty much given me everything.\n\n266\n00:14:17.684 --> 00:14:23.586\nThey can also look,\ncontact can interrupt do not status.\n\n267\n00:14:23.586 --> 00:14:25.444\n&gt;&gt; Do not disturb, yep.\n&gt;&gt; Oo, yes or sorry, what did I say?\n\n268\n00:14:25.444 --> 00:14:27.287\n&gt;&gt; Do not status.\n\n269\n00:14:27.287 --> 00:14:31.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] all right, well,\na little filp-a-roo one that one.\n\n270\n00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.266\nThe do not disturb status,\n\n271\n00:14:33.266 --> 00:14:37.980\nso that's the people that could get\nthrough if you wanted to give them that.\n\n272\n00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.300\nBut colleagues, they wouldn't be able\nto get you on the do not disturb,\n\n273\n00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.110\nand you can see it's sharing\na lot of information.\n\n274\n00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:47.692\nThe External Contacts, it's only gonna\ngive name, email, company, picture.\n\n275\n00:14:47.692 --> 00:14:53.152\nJust kinda the basic information,\nbut not all my other stuff.\n\n276\n00:14:53.152 --> 00:14:57.554\nNow that's how they will see me, okay?\n\n277\n00:14:57.554 --> 00:15:01.444\nThat's not how they have me.\n\n278\n00:15:01.444 --> 00:15:03.664\nWait, did I just put that-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n279\n00:15:03.664 --> 00:15:05.430\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda confusing.\n\n280\n00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:09.560\nAll right, but it's for,\nI'm setting my relationship status.\n\n281\n00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.300\n&gt;&gt; Right, but I think you said it right.\n\n282\n00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.018\nIt is about how much I\nwant somebody else to see.\n\n283\n00:15:15.018 --> 00:15:17.577\nSo if I put them into\nthe External Contacts,\n\n284\n00:15:17.577 --> 00:15:22.434\nI'm really limiting the amount of access\nthat they have to the information I have.\n\n285\n00:15:22.434 --> 00:15:24.211\nIf I put them into the Workgroup,\n\n286\n00:15:24.211 --> 00:15:27.780\nI'm really not only giving them\nfull access to that information.\n\n287\n00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.177\nBut even the ability to override\na setting that I have put in place,\n\n288\n00:15:31.177 --> 00:15:33.740\nsomething like the do not disturb itself.\n\n289\n00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:39.070\nSo it is providing more access to you\nthan you think as you start to do this.\n\n290\n00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.140\nSo it is important that you put\nthem in the right relationships.\n\n291\n00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and actually with yours\nright here, with Ronnie, it says,\n\n292\n00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.050\nit's available, right?\n\n293\n00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:51.400\nNow I could go ahead and have him in my\nWorkgroup, but I'm not in his Workgroup.\n\n294\n00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.753\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So what I'd like you to do, Ronnie,\n\n295\n00:15:53.753 --> 00:15:58.109\nif you don't mind, go ahead and\nchange the relationship status for me, JT,\n\n296\n00:15:58.109 --> 00:15:59.193\non your computer.\n\n297\n00:15:59.193 --> 00:16:02.084\nAnd watch what's gonna happen on my end.\n\n298\n00:16:02.084 --> 00:16:05.049\nOf what I will be able to see, look!\n\n299\n00:16:05.049 --> 00:16:08.565\nI actually just see a lot more,\nI can see your tag line,\n\n300\n00:16:08.565 --> 00:16:11.285\nyour note that you have put in there.\n\n301\n00:16:11.285 --> 00:16:16.252\nFailure will never overtake me if my\ndetermination to succeed is strong enough.\n\n302\n00:16:16.252 --> 00:16:18.125\nThat's makes me feel\nvery empowered right now.\n\n303\n00:16:18.125 --> 00:16:21.042\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you could see that I have got more\n\n304\n00:16:21.042 --> 00:16:26.737\ninformation about Ronnie because he\nchanged the status of me on him.\n\n305\n00:16:26.737 --> 00:16:31.197\n[LAUGH] I feel like I\nsometimes roll that around.\n\n306\n00:16:31.197 --> 00:16:35.262\nAnd you can see how my contact\ncard is that I can see.\n\n307\n00:16:35.262 --> 00:16:39.150\nThere's not a lot more that I can see\nin here because it's still like your\n\n308\n00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.823\norganization what can be set.\n\n309\n00:16:40.823 --> 00:16:45.812\nBut just know that that level on my\ncontact card could be changed or\n\n310\n00:16:45.812 --> 00:16:51.180\nwhat I can see might be different\ndepending on that status that is set.\n\n311\n00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:59.280\nAnd this is another one that we determined\nis really connected to the out of office.\n\n312\n00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.750\nSo let's jump over here to Joey.\n\n313\n00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:05.500\nJoey right now JT on Joey's account,\nI believe,\n\n314\n00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.430\nis set as an external contact,\ncurrently, correct?\n\n315\n00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; All right so that means he's external.\n\n316\n00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:15.420\nI know that he's out of the office cuz I\nwalked over to this computer and set it.\n\n317\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.610\nI couldn't understand.\n\n318\n00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:21.590\nWell, go ahead and set that to a work\ngroup or any of the others, actually.\n\n319\n00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:22.650\nLook at that.\n\n320\n00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:27.240\nSo, I have got that Joey,\nhe's in the dance studio, so\n\n321\n00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.870\nI can see that his location\nis being shared with me.\n\n322\n00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:34.410\nBecause he changed that relationship,\nI finally got that purple dot and\n\n323\n00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.280\nI can see that.\n\n324\n00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.160\nAnd if I look at this contact card now.\n\n325\n00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.190\nLook at that contact card and, my gosh,\n\n326\n00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:46.042\nI can actually see he's out of\nthe office and he'll be back at 4:30 PM.\n\n327\n00:17:46.042 --> 00:17:48.260\nAnd then he's got a current location.\n\n328\n00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:53.120\nAnd there's all this information\nthat I can see about Joey.\n\n329\n00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.640\nI will be back soon.\n\n330\n00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.400\nAnd I put dash internal message.\n\n331\n00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.350\nBecause when you set you're out of office,\nin Outlook you can determine\n\n332\n00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:05.630\ninternal messages and outernal [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah external\n\n333\n00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.320\n&gt;&gt; External messages to people and\n\n334\n00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:13.190\nthat's what I was seeing so\nI forgot that step honestly.\n\n335\n00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:19.330\nIn here is the privacy relationships,\nthat's why it wasn't pulling up, big one.\n\n336\n00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.861\nAnd then back over here in my settings,\n\n337\n00:18:21.861 --> 00:18:25.855\njust to show you where that was\ncuz we went through looking it.\n\n338\n00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:27.330\nRight here in the personal,\n\n339\n00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.290\nupdate my preference based\non my calendar information.\n\n340\n00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:36.310\nShow my out of office information\nto contacts in friends and\n\n341\n00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:38.965\nfamily, workgroup, and colleagues.\n\n342\n00:18:38.965 --> 00:18:41.250\nDoesn't say anything about external,\ndoes it?\n\n343\n00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:45.390\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, okay, ao anybody that is in\n\n344\n00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:51.720\na relationship of external will not\nsee your out of office in Skype.\n\n345\n00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:57.370\nThey would have to be in one of these\nother groups, if that's important enough\n\n346\n00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:02.640\nfor you to have that particular\nperson see your status.\n\n347\n00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.983\nAnd see more stuff, your notes and\nyour location and all that.\n\n348\n00:19:06.983 --> 00:19:12.051\nAnd you can see how that all\nchanged based on Ronnie and\n\n349\n00:19:12.051 --> 00:19:16.700\nJoey putting JT in their\nrelationship status.\n\n350\n00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.325\nSo it's kind of you know it's\nlike no we're just friends now.\n\n351\n00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:23.990\n[LAUGH] Those types of things, just change\nin relations, it's almost like Facebook.\n\n352\n00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.600\nRight, when you see those?\n\n353\n00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.910\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; Relationship status changes,\n\n354\n00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.424\nyou're like, ooh, something went down.\n\n355\n00:19:28.424 --> 00:19:29.371\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; At least,\n\n356\n00:19:29.371 --> 00:19:32.195\nthat's what I usually think of.\n\n357\n00:19:32.195 --> 00:19:33.690\n[LAUGH].\nSo you can do that.\n\n358\n00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:38.380\nAnd I have tested this out with Renee,\nthat where I put her in each one.\n\n359\n00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:42.669\nAnd what I could see on her's,\ncuz her's got a detailed contact list, and\n\n360\n00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:45.680\nactually, just to bring up Renee,\njust to see her.\n\n361\n00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:51.080\nIf I look at her contact card that\nshe is the Queen of Awesomeness.\n\n362\n00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.620\nThat's not in our IT ProTV organization,\n\n363\n00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:58.400\nI added that because I did add her\nto my contacts with an Outlook.\n\n364\n00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.880\nI went ahead and edited, and\n\n365\n00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:05.130\nI gave her my own title, because well\nI mean shit so that's pretty cool.\n\n366\n00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:07.970\nSo, all those different things\nyou can set so just different\n\n367\n00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:12.780\nthings that are important to understand\nabout what is a contact card?\n\n368\n00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.484\nWhat you can and cannot see and\nchanging your relationships.\n\n369\n00:20:16.484 --> 00:20:23.050\nAnd then maybe even like asking your co\nworkers to change your status with them,\n\n370\n00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:27.780\nbut say hey,\nI really wanna be in your work group.\n\n371\n00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.515\nNo, you´re still an external contractor.\n\n372\n00:20:29.515 --> 00:20:30.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n373\n00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:35.640\nit does give you different options\nin why you might not be able to\n\n374\n00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:41.240\ncontact them at certain times, and why you\nmight not see their out of office replies.\n\n375\n00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.800\nSo, I think that ties it all together and\nagain,\n\n376\n00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.002\nit's not on the Mac,\nweird thing so, here you go.\n\n377\n00:20:48.002 --> 00:20:50.110\n&gt;&gt; Alright Vonne,\njust want one last question here,\n\n378\n00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.260\nespecially when dealing with this idea.\n\n379\n00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.750\nWhat if we needed to block a contact?\n\n380\n00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.080\n&gt;&gt; Good point, yes.\n\n381\n00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.622\nSo, if I wanted to block you Ronnie,\n\n382\n00:20:58.622 --> 00:21:02.403\nlike I just really need you\nto stop bothering me about.\n\n383\n00:21:02.403 --> 00:21:07.030\nCuz you send me pictures of those kittens,\nthose adorable kittens all the time.\n\n384\n00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:07.620\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n385\n00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.120\n&gt;&gt; You really want me to adopt those\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n386\n00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.015\n&gt;&gt; I know you do.\n\n387\n00:21:11.015 --> 00:21:12.485\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna block you.\n\n388\n00:21:12.485 --> 00:21:13.989\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can go ahead and\n\n389\n00:21:13.989 --> 00:21:18.952\nchange this privacy relationship\nto blocked contact so\n\n390\n00:21:18.952 --> 00:21:24.130\nthat way he can try to IM me\nwith those adorable pictures.\n\n391\n00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:27.545\nAnd I could be like, nope,\nI'm sorry, you've got to stop.\n\n392\n00:21:27.545 --> 00:21:33.000\n[LAUGHTER] But no you can keep sending\nthem to me, because they're really cute.\n\n393\n00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.584\nBut I'm still not adopting them, sorry.\n\n394\n00:21:34.584 --> 00:21:35.445\n&gt;&gt; Aw, man, I'm broken

I would like to assume so.\n\n24\n00:00:58.218 --> 00:00:58.933\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sure.\n[LAUGH]\n\n25\n00:00:58.933 --> 00:00:59.591\n&gt;&gt; But you know what\n\n26\n00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:00.633\nhappens when you assume.\n\n27\n00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:06.451\nSo we're gonna take it that well,\nyou don't know what it means to IM people.\n\n28\n00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:07.207\n&gt;&gt; Well, you would've gotten me there.\n\n29\n00:01:07.207 --> 00:01:09.827\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's the chat, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:09.827 --> 00:01:12.022\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So we're going to be communicating,\n\n31\n00:01:12.022 --> 00:01:15.758\nwe're in our topic that we are calling\nconversations because that's what\n\n32\n00:01:15.758 --> 00:01:17.135\nSkype For Business calls.\n\n33\n00:01:17.135 --> 00:01:20.161\nAll of the different ways that\nyou communicate with each other,\n\n34\n00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:23.427\nwhether it is IMing or instant messaging,\nso we're just chatting.\n\n35\n00:01:23.427 --> 00:01:25.590\nWe're just going to type to each other.\n\n36\n00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.117\nWe're not going to do any audio calls,\nor videoconferencing, or video calls.\n\n37\n00:01:31.117 --> 00:01:35.318\nSo, those are other ways that\nwe can have conversations.\n\n38\n00:01:35.318 --> 00:01:38.788\nBut these episodes right\nin here are mini series.\n\n39\n00:01:38.788 --> 00:01:40.801\nWe've done a couple of mini\nseries together, Ronnie.\n\n40\n00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:41.678\n&gt;&gt; We have.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n41\n00:01:41.678 --> 00:01:42.364\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, we have.\n\n42\n00:01:42.364 --> 00:01:43.854\n&gt;&gt; We did Access, we did quite a few.\n\n43\n00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:44.478\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, quite a few.\n\n44\n00:01:44.478 --> 00:01:45.532\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so\n\n45\n00:01:45.532 --> 00:01:48.469\nwe're gonna go ahead and\ntackle a couple of those things.\n\n46\n00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:53.346\nIn this particular episode,\nwe're gonna concentrate on a single\n\n47\n00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:56.925\nIM with one person that\nhas an available status.\n\n48\n00:01:56.925 --> 00:02:00.952\nSo not all the other nuances that\nwe'll get into and some other ones,\n\n49\n00:02:00.952 --> 00:02:04.019\nit's just like the most\nstraightforward we can go.\n\n50\n00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:07.396\nGet into the IM chat window,\nand go like that.\n\n51\n00:02:07.396 --> 00:02:11.770\nAnd so if I say chat or if I say IM\ni,t really is instant message always,\n\n52\n00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.234\nso we're just gonna be typing it a lot.\n\n53\n00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:17.270\nAnd we're going to be talking to each\nother even though we're right in the same\n\n54\n00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.924\nroom together.\n\n55\n00:02:17.924 --> 00:02:20.107\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's fine, well,\n\n56\n00:02:20.107 --> 00:02:23.972\nyou're impersonating Justin Timberlake,\nyour favorite.\n\n57\n00:02:23.972 --> 00:02:26.560\nAnd I'm impersonating me,\nnot exactly my favorite.\n\n58\n00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.702\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we'll actually\n\n59\n00:02:27.702 --> 00:02:28.763\nbe able to make this work.\n\n60\n00:02:28.763 --> 00:02:30.840\nSo Vonne,\nwhere are we gonna start of here?\n\n61\n00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.185\n&gt;&gt; Well why don't we go ahead and\njump down into Justin's computer.\n\n62\n00:02:34.185 --> 00:02:35.877\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; And let's take a look.\n\n63\n00:02:35.877 --> 00:02:37.215\nI'm already logged in.\n\n64\n00:02:37.215 --> 00:02:40.760\nAnd we have all of our contacts\nright here in our groups.\n\n65\n00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.389\nI'm just going to throw something out and\nI don't,\n\n66\n00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.852\nI don't know if I know\nexactly why this happens.\n\n67\n00:02:45.852 --> 00:02:49.195\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But see, see right down here\n\n68\n00:02:49.195 --> 00:02:54.158\nwhere it has this like Live,\nand then this %3.\n\n69\n00:02:54.158 --> 00:02:57.808\nNow, I know that that von_neopdc,\noffice for demo code,\n\n70\n00:02:57.808 --> 00:03:03.216\nwas the one that I created when we were\ndoing our Outlook shows to have that free.\n\n71\n00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:06.725\nBut look at now,\nit's kind of just thrown itself into this.\n\n72\n00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:08.741\nBut there's one down here too.\n\n73\n00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:14.502\nSo this just keeps happening to me.\n\n74\n00:03:14.502 --> 00:03:17.640\nI will be completely honest,\nI don't know why?\n\n75\n00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.439\nIt just does.\n\n76\n00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.431\nSo any insight Ronnie?\n\n77\n00:03:20.431 --> 00:03:24.912\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes the conversations actually\nend up getting crossed a little bit,\n\n78\n00:03:24.912 --> 00:03:28.630\nnot to get where you can't\nunderstand what's going on.\n\n79\n00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.620\nBut Vonne may had actually had where\nan instant message came into her and\n\n80\n00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.210\nshe respond to that.\n\n81\n00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.360\nLater on, another point after some period\nof time, she responded back to an instant\n\n82\n00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.780\nmessage and now what she actually actually\nsees in her window are really kind of\n\n83\n00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.060\nthe two parts of the same conversation or\na later conversation that's happened here.\n\n84\n00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.275\nBut that's what's going on here is that\nyou're actually seeing this kind of\n\n85\n00:03:52.275 --> 00:03:55.785\nunusual thing, where it's not grouping all\nmessages together right now in a single\n\n86\n00:03:55.785 --> 00:03:56.642\nconversation yet.\n\n87\n00:03:56.642 --> 00:03:57.733\n&gt;&gt; But this is a contact.\n\n88\n00:03:57.733 --> 00:03:58.267\n&gt;&gt; I understand.\n\n89\n00:03:58.267 --> 00:03:59.488\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n90\n00:03:59.488 --> 00:04:03.849\n&gt;&gt; It's weird though, but\nnotice that this is happening with Skype.\n\n91\n00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.815\nRegular Skype, not Skype for Business.\n\n92\n00:04:06.815 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd it keeps popping up.\n\n93\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.592\nI'll sign out, and it's not there,\nand then I sign back in and\n\n94\n00:04:11.592 --> 00:04:13.793\nthen it's like okay,\nwell now it's aside of this.\n\n95\n00:04:13.793 --> 00:04:17.409\nNow I have this whole string\nof numbers going on here.\n\n96\n00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:23.773\nSo the systems, they talk to each\nother but not always perfectly.\n\n97\n00:04:23.773 --> 00:04:25.870\nSo.\n&gt;&gt; Well some of this is cached.\n\n98\n00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.615\nSo it might be where it didn't\nmake the full connection or\n\n99\n00:04:28.615 --> 00:04:32.176\nstarted to make the connection and\nthen the next message didn't come in.\n\n100\n00:04:32.176 --> 00:04:35.943\nSo it connected it as best as it could and\nthen it's showing up here too.\n\n101\n00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:37.082\nAnd it's not responding back.\n\n102\n00:04:37.082 --> 00:04:38.869\nSo you're actually seeing\nthe back end of things.\n\n103\n00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:41.414\n&gt;&gt; And it could be that,\ncuz I have not chatted with myself,\n\n104\n00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.334\nIt's that I'm trying with other people.\n\n105\n00:04:43.334 --> 00:04:44.402\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n106\n00:04:44.402 --> 00:04:45.868\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's establishing the connections.\n\n107\n00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:47.146\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That's what you're talking about.\n\n108\n00:04:47.146 --> 00:04:49.023\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cuz I'm like wait,\n\n109\n00:04:49.023 --> 00:04:50.864\nno Ronnie cuz these are contexts.\n\n110\n00:04:50.864 --> 00:04:51.748\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; These aren't conversations.\n\n111\n00:04:51.748 --> 00:04:53.277\n&gt;&gt; I understand.\n&gt;&gt; But we have been,\n\n112\n00:04:53.277 --> 00:04:57.464\nI've been using this particular\naccount to create conversations.\n\n113\n00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:00.505\nSo that's why it kind\nof got a little loopy.\n\n114\n00:05:00.505 --> 00:05:01.923\n&gt;&gt; It can be that, yeah,\n\n115\n00:05:01.923 --> 00:05:06.196\nthe very fact is remember you're\nconnecting to on a cloud service.\n\n116\n00:05:06.196 --> 00:05:09.560\nAnd that means that sometimes\nmessages kind of get out of queue.\n\n117\n00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.940\nThey don't respond\nthe way that you want to.\n\n118\n00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.600\nBut then if you close down or they get\ndisconnected, when they come back up,\n\n119\n00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.460\nthey may not report everything that\nyou think that they're gonna report.\n\n120\n00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.710\nSo this is the best of\nyour Skype application\n\n121\n00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.540\ntrying to show you what it\nbelieves it's connected to.\n\n122\n00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.190\nAnd where you see it's pending,\nit's saying yeah,\n\n123\n00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.070\nI don't know if I'm really\nconnecting correctly yet.\n\n124\n00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.418\nSo you'll end up seeing things like\nthat happen every once in a while.\n\n125\n00:05:30.418 --> 00:05:34.152\nJust like sometimes I see two or\nthree messages from Vonne.\n\n126\n00:05:34.152 --> 00:05:37.368\nAnd I look at my contacts, and it\nactually shows Vonne two or three times.\n\n127\n00:05:37.368 --> 00:05:39.657\nBut after a while,\nit ends up merging sometimes.\n\n128\n00:05:39.657 --> 00:05:41.305\n&gt;&gt;

to,\nyou manage this or\n\n382\n00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.620\nat least you man this chat a lot, right?\n\n383\n00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.010\n&gt;&gt; I do answer a few chat questions.\n\n384\n00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.990\n&gt;&gt; You do, yes.\n\n385\n00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:43.250\nSo maybe I would like to go ahead and send\nthis link to the forums here at ITPROTV,\n\n386\n00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.776\nand then I will go ahead and copy that.\n\n387\n00:19:45.776 --> 00:19:49.051\nCome down into my Skype talk with Ronnie.\n\n388\n00:19:49.051 --> 00:19:52.702\nAnd if I just, honestly, I think it's\neasy, if I really wanna send you a link,\n\n389\n00:19:52.702 --> 00:19:56.900\nI'm just gonna put it right here in\nthe chat, and then just send it to you.\n\n390\n00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.280\nThat's fine, and then Ronnie\ncan go ahead and click on that.\n\n391\n00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.750\nBut if I wanted it to say something\ndifferent, like I want the text.\n\n392\n00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.790\nAnd I clicked on the Link button, by\nthe way, sorry, I was going a little fast.\n\n393\n00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:10.500\nI had my cursor right here,\nthen I click on that Link button.\n\n394\n00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:15.480\nI'm gonna say Forum, four, two?\n\n395\n00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:22.120\nFor ITProTV and\nthen I can paste the link into here.\n\n396\n00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.841\nThat's the wrong shortcut, so I'm just\nusing, by the way I'm using my ctrl C and\n\n397\n00:20:26.841 --> 00:20:30.990\nctrl V, sorry again,\nI'm just kind of doing what I normally do.\n\n398\n00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:33.520\nI love my shortcuts, but you can,\nof course, do any of your other ones.\n\n399\n00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.420\nYou can right click and\nso on and so forth.\n\n400\n00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:43.120\nIf I click okay, notice that now I have\ntext that is different from the link.\n\n401\n00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:46.160\nSo that's what the link box says and\n\n402\n00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:51.460\nyou choose which way you go, it's me\npersonally it's just a too much work.\n\n403\n00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.200\nI'm just gonna paste it right into\nmy chat and then go from there and\n\n404\n00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.860\nthat's the way where we can go ahead and\nsend some links.\n\n405\n00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.958\nNow a few other things that we can do,\nto play around with this,\n\n406\n00:21:00.958 --> 00:21:02.250\nmake it a little more fun.\n\n407\n00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:08.030\nDown here in the more options button,\nwe have some different things.\n\n408\n00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:11.800\nMaybe, I'm having a hard time seeing this,\nright?\n\n409\n00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.570\nI need to see this text a little bit\nbigger, so you could go ahead and\n\n410\n00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.670\nchange the display size.\n\n411\n00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:17.430\nSo if I go to 200%.\n\n412\n00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.430\nOoh, there we go.\n\n413\n00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:22.555\nNow it's probably actually a lot easier\nfor you all out there to see it,\n\n414\n00:21:22.555 --> 00:21:29.020\n[LAUGH] but you can see that my size\nof the font is 200%, rather than 100.\n\n415\n00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.110\nSo that can kind of help with\nresolutions and so on and so forth.\n\n416\n00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.931\nMaybe a really high resolution and\nyou wanna go ahead and\n\n417\n00:21:35.931 --> 00:21:37.380\nsee the a little bit bigger.\n\n418\n00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.388\nI'll put this to 125%.\n\n419\n00:21:39.388 --> 00:21:43.430\nThe other thing you can do is you can,\nyou can change your font and\n\n420\n00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.020\nyou can change the color.\n\n421\n00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.590\nGuess what I'm gonna go for Ronnie?\n\n422\n00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:47.942\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna assume pink.\n\n423\n00:21:47.942 --> 00:21:50.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH] Sounds so happy.\n\n424\n00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.150\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n425\n00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:56.930\n&gt;&gt; So I can go ahead and change this to\n\n426\n00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:01.080\npink sago 24, I do like a sago font,\nI will just say that right now.\n\n427\n00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:01.631\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n428\n00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:04.292\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's a nice font.\n\n429\n00:22:04.292 --> 00:22:09.246\nSo if I go ahead and say hello,\nnow you can see that I am typing\n\n430\n00:22:09.246 --> 00:22:13.130\nto Ronnie in big,\npink letters, lots of fun.\n\n431\n00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:15.884\nAnd then of course if he changes it,\nI can go ahead and\n\n432\n00:22:15.884 --> 00:22:17.710\nsee the different colors in here.\n\n433\n00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.070\nWhen we get into multiple messages,\nthis is message specific.\n\n434\n00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:26.620\nThis is not a every [LAUGH]\nsingle message that I\n\n435\n00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.250\nchat with everybody is going to be pink.\n\n436\n00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:33.300\nThis is just a setting I have\nwithin our particular chat.\n\n437\n00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.700\nAnd is that a courier?\n\n438\n00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.040\nDid you change that to courier?\n\n439\n00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:38.900\n&gt;&gt; To solace.\n\n440\n00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.870\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, solace,\ngetting fancy over there Ronnie.\n\n441\n00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:44.490\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; All right, wonderful.\n\n442\n00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:46.818\nSo, where are we at now?\n\n443\n00:22:46.818 --> 00:22:50.130\nWe are at the point where we're\ngoing to send an attachment, hm.\n\n444\n00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.590\nSo I would like to send him a picture.\n\n445\n00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.929\nOr maybe I wanna send them a word\ndocument or a PowerPoint or a PDF,\n\n446\n00:22:56.929 --> 00:23:00.351\nit doesn't have to be a photograph,\nI just wanted to let you know.\n\n447\n00:23:00.351 --> 00:23:01.735\nBut I'm gonna send that to you,\n\n448\n00:23:01.735 --> 00:23:04.625\nI'm gonna click on the little paper\nclip down there at the bottom.\n\n449\n00:23:04.625 --> 00:23:08.847\nWhich is where I can choose a file to\nsend in an attachment and, well then I go\n\n450\n00:23:08.847 --> 00:23:13.150\nright to my Skype for business where I'm\ntyping out all my notes for you all.\n\n451\n00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:18.870\nLet's go over to our pictures and\nI made you a picture, Ronny.\n\n452\n00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:19.450\n&gt;&gt; Did you?\n\n453\n00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.420\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nI drew this all by myself in Paint.\n\n454\n00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.080\nSo there you go.\n\n455\n00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.960\nI went ahead and just selected it and\nit just attached right in there.\n\n456\n00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.050\nI had doubled clicked on it.\n\n457\n00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:33.180\nYou could like single click on it and\nthen click, send and\n\n458\n00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.050\nso I have sent him an attachment.\n\n459\n00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:37.200\nWonderful.\n\n460\n00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.550\nAnd I'm wondering.\n\n461\n00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.580\nSend me something.\n\n462\n00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.570\nBecause I can't just tell\nyou right next to me.\n\n463\n00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:46.390\nI have to type it in.\n\n464\n00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:50.583\nSo I wanted to show you how you can\nreceive attachments, because sending them\n\n465\n00:23:50.583 --> 00:23:54.965\nfeels pretty easy, essentially you\njust go ahead and find your file.\n\n466\n00:23:54.965 --> 00:23:57.941\nNow, on the receiving end,\nwhat is it going to look like?\n\n467\n00:23:57.941 --> 00:24:01.767\nIt's not gonna show me right away.\n\n468\n00:24:01.767 --> 00:24:05.150\nI have to download this file.\n\n469\n00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:09.174\nNow, it could be multiple files\nthat you have sent to me.\n\n470\n00:24:09.174 --> 00:24:13.152\nSo the download and download all, I think\nit doesn't matter if it's one or five,\n\n471\n00:24:13.152 --> 00:24:15.008\nyou're gonna have the download all.\n\n472\n00:24:15.008 --> 00:24:19.853\nIt does give me a file size right there,\nso that's kind of a good thing\n\n473\n00:24:19.853 --> 00:24:24.050\nbecause if this was 10 megs,\nI know it might take a while.\n\n474\n00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:25.840\nAnd depending on our connection speeds,\nright?\n\n475\n00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.160\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; All of this,\n\n476\n00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.650\nall of your communication,\nis gonna depend on your connection speeds.\n\n477\n00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:35.500\nWe are hard wired in to our-\n&gt;&gt; Network?\n\n478\n00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.280\n&gt;&gt; Network.\n\n479\n00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.350\nSo if you're on wireless and\n\n480\n00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:41.950\nyou have a really low signal, just know\nthat some of this might take a while.\n\n481\n00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.530\nEven just a simple chat like a text.\n\n482\n00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.910\nSo just keep that in mind\nwhile you're doing this.\n\n483\n00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:50.290\nSo I want to go ahead and\nclick that button right there, or\n\n484\n00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.490\nyou can click that one, same thing.\n\n485\n00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:56.800\nAnd what it's doing is [LAUGH]\nit's actually downloading it.\n\n486\n00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:01.740\nAnd then it will give me\nthe preview of it within the chat\n\n487\n00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:06.622\nwindow that you have sent me a really\ncool looking cat, haven't you?\n\n488\n00:25:06.622 --> 00:25:12.660\n[LAUGH] Now if I click on this,\nit's going to ask me to open it.\n\n489\n00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.850\nNow because this is a JPEG, it's like,\nhey, do you wanna open this file?\n\n490\n00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:17.580\nYeah, that's fine.\n\n491\n00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.083\nAnd I think it asks that with all of the\nfiles, it doesn't matter what file it is.\n\n492\n00:25:21.083 --> 00:25:24.782\nBut if this was a Word file, if you sent\nme a document, it would open up in Word.\n\n493\n00:25:24.782 --> 00:25:30.410\nIf you sent me a PDF, it would open up in\nmy Acrobat or the viewer or what have you.\n\n494\n00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:33.010\nSo that's where it's like, are you sure?\n\n495\n00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:34.680\nAnd the other thing,\nit's nice that they do this,\n\n496\n00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.665\nbecause they're like,\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n497\n00:25:36.665 --> 00:25:38.640\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Because you're getting something out\n\n498\n00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.720\nfrom the internet,\nI don't know if you really want to,\n\n499\n00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.110\nare you sure you trust this person?\n\n500\n00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.770\nRonnie, I think trust you.\n\n501\n00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n502\n00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.890\nif I click Open, notice that it's\njust opening up in my photos.\n\n503\n00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:55.780\nBut again, it's going to attach\nitself to whatever application\n\n504\n00:25:55.780 --> 00:26:00.460\nthat particular file type is\ngoing to be associated with.\n\n505\n00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.730\nWonderful, nice cat.\n\n506\n00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.810\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, you actually make\na very good point which we all should\n\n507\n00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:06.900\nemphasize here.\n\n508\n00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.620\nBecause of the way that we\nget attachments, right?\n\n509\n00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:14.240\nIt's real easy to think that this\nalways comes with good intentions, but\n\n510\n00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.260\nit doesn't.\n\n511\n00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:19.350\nSo make sure that you're expecting an\nattachment from whoever is sending it to\n\n512\n00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:23.240\nyou, regardless of whether they're\nin your Skype contact or not.\n\n513\n00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.300\nIt can be very easy,\n\n514\n00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:28.710\njust something as simple as, I walked away\nfrom my computer and now somebody said I'm\n\n515\n00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:33.880\ngonna send Vonne an attachment\nbecause I can get access to the Skype.\n\n516\n00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.890\nAnd once they do that, Vonne automatically\nclicks it because she sees it from me.\n\n517\n00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:41.120\nIf you're ever unsure, like,\nwhy did I receive an attachment?\n\n518\n00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.340\nIt's always better to confirm.\n\n519\n00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:47.480\nSo before opening it up, you may either\nwant to go ahead and send another IM, or\n\n520\n00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.510\njust pick up the phone and say,\nhey Ronnie, did you send me an attachment?\n\n521\n00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.150\nI go, I don't think I did.\n\n522\n00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:56.230\nWell, that would actually\nbe a good indication,\n\n523\n00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:59.140\ndon't open this, because you\nreally want to make sure of that.\n\n524\n00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.540\nSo, even though it gives you\nthat nice ability to do so,\n\n525\n00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.710\nit may not be something you always want.\n\n526\n00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:09.512\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the impersonating and, like\nyou said, you walk away from your desk.\n\n527\n00:27:09.512 --> 00:27:11.310\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yep.\n&gt;&gt; Just always be a little careful.\n\n528\n00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:16.972\nI even was like, when you sent me\nthe name of the file, I was like, hm.\n\n529\n00:27:16.972 --> 00:27:18.330\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, right.\n\n530\n00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.900\n&gt;&gt; Should I open this?\n\n531\n00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.730\nI know Ronnie, and I know that\n\n532\n00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:25.666\nwe're not going to be sending malicious\nfile to each other, at least on purpose.\n\n533\n00:27:25.666 --> 00:27:27.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, not on purpose.\n\n534\n00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we can do that.\n\n535\n00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:34.090\nSo the other thing I want to cover\nhere is where this is all going.\n\n536\n00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:34.745\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n537\n00:27:34.745 --> 00:27:39.295\n&gt;&gt; Because a lot of times when I click\non something from the internet, or\n\n538\n00:27:39.295 --> 00:27:42.795\nI'm downloading a file from our Dropbox or\nwhat have you,\n\n539\n00:27:42.795 --> 00:27:44.765\nit goes into my Downloads folder.\n\n540\n00:27:44.765 --> 00:27:45.275\nRight?\n\n541\n00:27:45.275 --> 00:27:48.215\nWell if I go in to my File Explorer,\n\n542\n00:27:48.215 --> 00:27:51.030\nwhich I just clicked on the little\nfolder button down at the bottom.\n\n543\n00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:55.200\nAnd I go to my Downloads,\nit's not in here, okay?\n\n544\n00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.430\nI can see my setups and\nmy Haroopad and everything,\n\n545\n00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.920\nbut I don't see that particular document.\n\n546\n00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:08.350\nThat is because any attachments\nthat you get sent through Skype\n\n547\n00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:15.660\nautomatically go into what's called\nthe My Received Files folder,\n\n548\n00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.520\nwhich is located in the Documents folder.\n\n549\n00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.310\nThat's just how they set it up.\n\n550\n00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:23.640\nSo, notice in my Documents folder,\nMy Received Files,\n\n551\n00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.380\nI actually have a couple different\nattachments that I've been sent.\n\n552\n00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.900\nThese were things that Marisha was\nactually doing some screenshots for\n\n553\n00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.890\nme, or I think I was sending?\n\n554\n00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:36.760\nYeah, Marisha sent it to me and\nthen I went ahead and got it.\n\n555\n00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:40.300\nThese are some other ones that\nmy friend Tiffany sent to me,\n\n556\n00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.170\nnotice that's the one from Ronnie.\n\n557\n00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:47.050\nSo all of my files got sent\nto this particular folder.\n\n558\n00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:51.488\nSo always make sure you understand\nthat that's where it's going to go.\n\n559\n00:28:51.488 --> 00:28:55.951\nMaybe you don't want them to go there,\nI don't want to have My Received Files.\n\n560\n00:28:55.951 --> 00:28:57.710\nAnd that happened when\nyou installed Skype.\n\n561\n00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.220\nSo you didn't make this folder.\n\n562\n00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.480\nIt's just like you didn't\nmake a Pictures folder,\n\n563\n00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.630\nyou didn't make a Documents folder,\nit's just part of what it does.\n\n564\n00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.560\nBut you can control this.\n\n565\n00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:12.360\nIf I come into the settings back here\nin my Skype window and I go into here,\n\n566\n00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.440\nI believe it is right there, File saving.\n\n567\n00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.810\nIt is going to transfer files\nautomatically into this directory.\n\n568\n00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:25.320\nMaybe you wanna send it into your\nown folder that you created in\n\n569\n00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.820\na different location.\n\n570\n00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.920\nYou can then go ahead and\n\n571\n00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:33.400\nset that by telling it where within your\nfile directory you would want it to go.\n\n572\n00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.910\nMaybe you want them all to go\nto your desktop for some reason.\n\n573\n00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:41.161\nI tend to be one of those like,\nI clutter my desktop up a lot,\n\n574\n00:29:41.161 --> 00:29:42.910\nthen I sort it away later.\n\n575\n00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.940\nYou could go ahead and\nset that if you wanted to.\n\n576\n00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.630\nI'm gonna cancel that and\njust keep the default location, but\n\n577\n00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:50.780\nit's good to know and be able to set that.\n\n578\n00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.760\nAll right, so now I am done\ntalking with Ronnie, all right?\n\n579\n00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.910\nI don't wanna chat with him anymore.\n\n580\n00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.370\nAll I have to do is just close the window,\nokay?\n\n581\n00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:02.700\nSo if I close this, I'm done.\n\n582\n00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:06.170\nIt's like we've had our little chat\nsession and everything's fine.\n\n583\n00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:08.800\nBut where do all these conversations go?\n\n584\n00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:14.650\nEvery single one that you make,\nevery communication that you do,\n\n585\n00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:20.120\nit is stored in a log file,\nif you want to say.\n\n586\n00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:24.050\nNotice over here in our Conversations\nbutton, that's where they all are.\n\n587\n00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:26.460\nThey're all right there,\nthere's the last one,\n\n588\n00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.020\nyou can see that it has the specific time.\n\n589\n00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.350\nYou can see that I've been doing\na lot of different testing in here.\n\n590\n00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:34.370\nBut if I scroll on down,\n\n591\n00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:38.300\nnotice that it also starts giving\nme the other dates of everything.\n\n592\n00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:42.680\nSo everything is stored\nhere in our conversations.\n\n593\n00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.560\nNow I have a whole\nepisode that we have for\n\n594\n00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.870\nmanaging instant message conversations.\n\n595\n00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:51.430\nWe'll talk about, what do I need to\ndelete them and where does it go?\n\n596\n00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:55.150\nAnd how is this all connected to Outlook,\nand do I wanna connect it to Outlook?\n\n597\n00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:59.850\nBut, like I said, we'll save that for\nanother show because I think right there,\n\n598\n00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:05.080\nwe have pretty much completed all the\nbasic information of instant messaging.\n\n599\n00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:09.950\nHow to start one, how to go ahead and\ntype all the different things out,\n\n600\n00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:13.100\nour attachments, and that's about it.\n\n601\n00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.510\nYou know what?\nThere was one that we didn't do.\n\n602\n00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.150\nI didn't actually receive\nan instant message,\n\n603\n00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.135\nbecause I started an instant message,\nright?\n\n604\n00:31:19.135 --> 00:31:21.160\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; How do I go ahead and and receive this?\n\n605\n00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.530\nIt's pretty simple,\nbecause then everything else past that,\n\n606\n00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:25.290\nwe just go ahead and do the same thing.\n\n607\n00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:28.060\nSo, Ronnie, if you don't mind,\ncan you go ahead?\n\n608\n00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.170\nAnd I am JT.\n\n609\n00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:33.790\nAnd let's move my head out of the way\nbecause it's something that comes up\n\n610\n00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:36.020\nwhen I'm just here hanging out.\n\n611\n00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.300\nMaybe even have this minimized and\nso on and so forth.\n\n612\n00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:43.538\nI wanna see if Ronnie's going to IM me and\nthen we [SOUND].\n\n613\n00:31:43.538 --> 00:31:45.250\nThere it is, right there.\n\n614\n00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.440\nHello JT.\nYou're the coolest.\n\n615\n00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.020\nI know he is the coolest.\n\n616\n00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:53.460\n[LAUGH] But notice I have an option of\nreplying, or you know what, I don't\n\n617\n00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:57.440\nreally feel like chatting with you right\nnow, I could go ahead and ignore that.\n\n618\n00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:02.130\nSo just like you have with a phone\ncall coming in or anything,\n\n619\n00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:04.870\nyou can choose to not reply.\n\n620\n00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:08.450\nI'll go ahead and say reply and\nI'll be like, thank you, and\n\n621\n00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:09.970\nthen I will go ahead and send this.\n\n622\n00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:13.130\nSo that's really the only last\nthing I guess I should cover in\n\n623\n00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:16.820\nthe basics of instant messaging, is well,\n\n624\n00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.320\nwhat is it look like to actually\nget one from somebody else [LAUGH].\n\n625\n00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.150\n&gt;&gt; It is quite unusual, right?\n\n626\n00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:23.680\nThe very first message that you receive,\n\n627\n00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.860\nit doesn't necessarily pop up the Skype\nfor Business interface itself.\n\n628\n00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.400\nIt tends to show up in the notification\narea inside of Windows so that you can\n\n629\n00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.800\nrespond right there without having to\ngo and click, and click, and click.\n\n630\n00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.720\nIt gives you that nice,\n\n631\n00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.290\ninstantaneous reply that you can have,\nwhich is really neat because it does seem\n\n632\n00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:45.186\nalmost out of place in comparison to the\nrest of the interface that we see there.\n\n633\n00:32:45.186 --> 00:32:47.290\nAll right, Vonne, well thank you again for\n\n634\n00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:52.150\nhelping us out here in learning about\nthe basics of instant messaging.\n\n635\n00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:55.810\nWe wanted to make sure that you had at\nleast a fundamental understanding of\n\n636\n00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:57.160\nwhat can actually happen.\n\n637\n00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.100\nAnd of course some of\nthe different things you can do,\n\n638\n00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:03.560\nsuch as adding in attachments or\neven sending links, changing the size,\n\n639\n00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.850\nespecially if you need to see\nmore of it instead of smaller.\n\n640\n00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:10.360\nYou can make it smaller, but I would\nhave a hard time seeing it as well.\n\n641\n00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:15.340\nBut this is one of those communication\ntools that is available for\n\n642\n00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.490\nus and we're going to see it probably\nbeing used more often as well.\n\n643\n00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:21.970\nAll right, Vonne, well, since we've\nactually kind of gone over everything,\n\n644\n00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:24.990\nthis is a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n645\n00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:29.030\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n646\n00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:29.980\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n647\n00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:33.473\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Skype for Business episodes.\n\n648\n00:33:33.473 --> 00:33:37.692\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.165\nYou're watching the Skype for\nBusiness Show.\n\n4\n00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:19.650\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong,\n\n5\n00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.370\nand today we are actually taking a look\nat managing multiple instant messages.\n\n6\n00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.680\nAnd here to help us out\nonce again is going to,\n\n7\n00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.575\nwell the Office Pro genius herself,\nVonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:30.575 --> 00:00:32.010\nVonne, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.540\n&gt;&gt; Feeling pretty smart there\nwith that introduction.\n\n10\n00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.530\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne.\n\n11\n00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.100\nWe've talked about this idea where\nwe've been instant messaging back and\n\n12\n00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.490\nforth in our personas\nthat we've been using.\n\n13\n00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.440\nAnd now we're actually\nmoving into the realm of\n\n14\n00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.240\ntrying to do something like\na group chat together as well.\n\n15\n00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.570\nSo I've seen this on the internet,\nVonne, but Inside of Skype for\n\n16\n00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.188\nBusiness we can do the same thing, right?\n\n17\n00:00:55.188 --> 00:01:00.345\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean it's just like on my\nphone I have multiple messages going on.\n\n18\n00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:04.135\nCuz, well last episode\nin our sequence it was\n\n19\n00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:08.735\njust one single chat that I\nwas having with one person.\n\n20\n00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.920\nWell, [LAUGH] my chats,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n21\n00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.470\n&gt;&gt; I got a whole bunch of different\n\n22\n00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.290\nchats going on.\n\n23\n00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.350\nI'm talking with my sister and I'm talking\nwith my husband and all my friends.\n\n24\n00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.800\nAnd we have group chats, all right.\n\n25\n00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.463\nWe have a family chat that we all\ntalk on and send pictures and\n\n26\n00:01:21.463 --> 00:01:23.000\neverything like that.\n\n27\n00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.470\nSo I wanted to kind of wanted to separate\nthat into this particular episode of just\n\n28\n00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.130\nmanaging multiple conversations.\n\n29\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.420\nAnd like you said we are going to talk\nabout how a group IM changes ever so\n\n30\n00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.090\nslightly when we're,\nwhen we add multiple participants.\n\n31\n00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.840\nAnd then the other thing we're going to\ntalk about is the copying and pasting.\n\n32\n00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.240\nFew little nuances on that one that I will\ngo ahead and demonstrate for you, so yeah.\n\n33\n00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.700\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a good idea Vonne.\n\n34\n00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.290\nSo, now that we've got this basics\nof an instant message going on,\n\n35\n00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.580\nhow do we make this into, Into a group\nchat, and what are we gonna do here?\n\n36\n00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.880\n&gt;&gt; All right, well why don't we just go\nahead and jump on down into my computer.\n\n37\n00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.830\nAnd let's have some conversations.\n\n38\n00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.785\nSo I will start one with you.\n\n39\n00:02:07.785 --> 00:02:09.090\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I will start one with Ronnie.\n\n40\n00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.070\nAnd I'm just gonna double\nclick on this one, or\n\n41\n00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.370\nyou know what, I'm already hovered why\ndon't I just Just click on the button.\n\n42\n00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.290\nSo I will send an instant\nmessage to Ronnie.\n\n43\n00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.620\nAnd I will say hello and there we go.\n\n44\n00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.850\nI've got my message starting with Ronnie.\n\n45\n00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.295\nAnd so we can go ahead and\nbe chatting back and forth.\n\n46\n00:02:27.295 --> 00:02:30.310\nCuz when you're in an office you have\n\n47\n00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.460\nlots of different conversations throughout\nthe day with lots of different people.\n\n48\n00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.230\nSo we need to be able to manage this.\n\n49\n00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.230\nSo I'm gonna have my own separate\nconversation with Ronnie right here.\n\n50\n00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.120\nAnd then I'm gonna go ahead and\nadd in some other people.\n\n51\n00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.486\nMaybe we'll see if Marisha's around.\n\n52\n00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:48.434\nHello again, right?\n\n53\n00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:49.890\n[LAUGH] Little delay.\n\n54\n00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.730\nI saw Ronnie going like where'd it go?\n\n55\n00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.412\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But hey,\n\n56\n00:02:52.412 --> 00:02:53.690\nthat's the beauty of the Internet.\n\n57\n00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.740\nSometimes it just kinda gets\na little lost sometimes.\n\n58\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.900\nSo let's see if Marisha's around.\n\n59\n00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.839\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nsay, hello Marisha.\n\n60\n00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:08.030\nAnd then this is JT.\n\n61\n00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.270\nAnd I will send it.\n\n62\n00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.660\nAnd now you can see that\ntwo things have happened.\n\n63\n00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.740\nI went ahead and\nI just started typing, and\n\n64\n00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.770\nI totally didn't, [LAUGH] forgot\nto even mention what's happening.\n\n65\n00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.450\nIt's opening up into tabbed\nconversations right now.\n\n66\n00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.210\nSo you can see that\nMarisha is saying hello.\n\n67\n00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.470\nI saw that she was typing right there.\n\n68\n00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.110\nSo you can say, hi, I'm fine.\n\n69\n00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.887\nAnd I didn't even do [LAUGH]\nmy apostrophe in here.\n\n70\n00:03:34.887 --> 00:03:38.430\nBut tabbed conversation means\nI'm in the same window.\n\n71\n00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.540\nNotice it's just the same one I only got,\nbut\n\n72\n00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.130\nI show in my task bar two different ones.\n\n73\n00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.090\nJust kind of throwing it out there for\nyou.\n\n74\n00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.210\nBut it's just a way of having\nmultiple conversations in one window.\n\n75\n00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.860\nSo that way I could go ahead and\nchat with Marishia for a little bit.\n\n76\n00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.000\nAnd then maybe I wanna jump on over and\nsay something to Ronnie.\n\n77\n00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.700\nSo I go over to Ronnie and\nthen I'd say, hi Ronnie.\n\n78\n00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.610\nAnd you can see that I can jump back and\nforth.\n\n79\n00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.447\nIt's a lot, I personally like this way but\nI will say,\n\n80\n00:04:13.447 --> 00:04:16.958\nit's kinda gotten me in\ntrouble a little bit too.\n\n81\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:21.108\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I might be thinking I'm talking\n\n82\n00:04:21.108 --> 00:04:25.760\nto Marishia right here\nandlLet's get lunch.\n\n83\n00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.030\nOr whatever, cuz you know, me and\nMarisha go to lunch all the time.\n\n84\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.642\nAnd then wait, I just sent it to Ronnie,\nI don't want to go to lunch with Ronnie.\n\n85\n00:04:32.642 --> 00:04:36.410\n[LAUGH] So then it's just uh-oh,\nwrong person.\n\n86\n00:04:37.442 --> 00:04:39.015\nWrong one.\n\n87\n00:04:39.015 --> 00:04:42.145\nI don't know if you've ever done that\nRonnie, but texted the wrong person?\n\n88\n00:04:42.145 --> 00:04:44.198\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna say no.\n\n89\n00:04:44.198 --> 00:04:48.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I've done that before.\n\n90\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.096\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's usually pretty benign.\n\n91\n00:04:53.096 --> 00:04:55.723\nWhoops sorry I thought\nI was texting Terry but\n\n92\n00:04:55.723 --> 00:04:59.190\nthe last one I pulled up was Marisha or\nsomething like that.\n\n93\n00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.610\nand so, oops, sorry.\n\n94\n00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.120\nDidn't mean to send that to you.\n\n95\n00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.267\nSo you gotta be a little careful\nabout this tabbed conversation.\n\n96\n00:05:05.267 --> 00:05:06.249\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And make sure,\n\n97\n00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:10.060\nthat you're on the right person\nwhen you wanna start talking.\n\n98\n00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.550\nThat's the default way, at least in\nmy settings, of how it's set up.\n\n99\n00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.099\nWhere if I wanted to go ahead and\n\n100\n00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.270\nhave multiple conversations with\npeople that I could do that.\n\n101\n00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:28.016\nBut, if I wanted to not have it that way,\nthere's a couple of options you can do.\n\n102\n00:05:28.016 --> 00:05:34.470\nNotice that Marisha right here,\nif I wanted to just kind of concentrate\n\n103\n00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.644\njust on her one conversation,\nI can pop the message out.\n\n104\n00:05:39.644 --> 00:05:41.610\nNow, there's a couple of\nways you can do this.\n\n105\n00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.460\nNotice that there's this little\nbutton up here at the very top\n\n106\n00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.760\nright hand corner where our\nregular Window command are.\n\n107\n00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.920\nIt's this new kind of arrow with,\na thing around it.\n\n108\n00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.910\n[LAUGH] That means pop\nout this conversation.\n\n109\n00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.340\nSo, if i go ahead and click it.\n\n110\n00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.440\nWell look at that.\n\n111\n00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.230\nNow, I have it in two separate windows.\n\n112\n00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:08.080\nAnd if I wanted to pop it back in,\nI can just click that button again.\n\n113\n00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.585\nAnd then it condenses back down.\n\n114\n00:06:10.585 --> 00:06:12.770\nSo that's one way that you can do it.\n\n115\n00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:13.590\nYou know what?\n\n116\n00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.760\nLet's put one more person in here,\n\n117\n00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.950\nlet's throw our good buddy Taylor in here,\nour wonderful director right now.\n\n118\n00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.140\nHello?\nAnd I can say, hello!\n\n119\n00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.608\nAnd then, I'm just trying to get multiple\nmessages going from different people and\n\n120\n00:06:28.608 --> 00:06:31.765\nyou can see that over in\nthis left hand task pane,\n\n121\n00:06:31.765 --> 00:06:34.960\nI have the control of who I am talking to.\n\n122\n00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.070\nNow, if I went ahead and wanted to pop\nTaylor's message out, I can right click\n\n123\n00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.700\non this, the person's name, and\npop the conversation out that way.\n\n124\n00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.240\nBut notice it's only just doing that that\none, and the other two with Marisha and\n\n125\n00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.890\nRonnie, they're still\nin that tabbed format.\n\n126\n00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.498\nSo, it's just a one or the other.\n\n127\n00:06:54.498 --> 00:06:56.960\nNow I can go ahead and\npop this one too if I wanted to.\n\n128\n00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.270\nBut you get the idea here is\nthat you could go ahead and\n\n129\n00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.360\nconcentrate on which one you wanted\nto focus by bringing it out.\n\n130\n00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.430\nBut maybe you don't like\ntabbed conversations at all.\n\n131\n00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.302\nCan we please just have each\none in its individual window?\n\n132\n00:07:12.302 --> 00:07:15.596\nCuz it makes it a little easier for\nmy little brain.\n\n133\n00:07:15.596 --> 00:07:19.770\nAnd it kind of, if I have to force\nmyself to move to a specific window,\n\n134\n00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:25.060\nit might help to make sure that when\nI'm chatting with Marisha about lunch,\n\n135\n00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.960\nit's really Marisha.\n\n136\n00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.040\nAnd now I'm gonna have to go\nout to lunch with Ronnie, and\n\n137\n00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.430\nwe're gonna have to go\nto go eat chicken wings.\n\n138\n00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:32.960\nI know you like these.\n\n139\n00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.728\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n140\n00:07:33.728 --> 00:07:36.202\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Which actually\nsounds really good right now.\n\n141\n00:07:36.202 --> 00:07:37.687\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can change this\n\n142\n00:07:37.687 --> 00:07:40.510\nin your preferences, or,\nI'm sorry your options.\n\n143\n00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.432\nIf I come back over here to Skype,\nand then I click on my options button.\n\n144\n00:07:45.432 --> 00:07:49.920\nYou can see in the IM section,\nthey're enable,\n\n145\n00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.873\ntabbed conversations that is checked on.\n\n146\n00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:58.956\nIf I uncheck it, click okay Notice\nhow all of my conversations\n\n147\n00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:04.570\nthat I just was conducting,\nthey all go into their own window.\n\n148\n00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:09.350\nSo that way I can click back and forth\nbetween them and make sure that I have\n\n149\n00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:15.260\nthe right window activated when I\nwant to go ahead and do my chats.\n\n150\n00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.920\nSo that's an option that you can have.\n\n151\n00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.210\nYou could also use your taskbar down here.\n\n152\n00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.620\nIf I wanted to switch over\nto chatting with Taylor,\n\n153\n00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:28.510\nwhether it was tabbed or not tabbed, I can\nthen click on that one and that activates,\n\n154\n00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.920\nor puts in focus, the window that\nI want to be participating in.\n\n155\n00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.840\nSo I'm gonna come back down here,\ncome back over to my Skype.\n\n156\n00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.760\nChange my options, because I do like\nthe tab and we're gonna keep it.\n\n157\n00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.620\nIt's a little bit easier for\nme to organize everything.\n\n158\n00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.180\nAnd notice that it all goes ahead and\ncollects itself together again.\n\n159\n00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.590\nSince we're in those options, let's go\nover a couple other ones that you might\n\n160\n00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.400\nhave been seeing, like,\nwhat does this mean?\n\n161\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.140\nMake tabs one line only.\n\n162\n00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.890\nWatch over here on\nthe left-hand task pane.\n\n163\n00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.145\nIf I turn that on, and I click okay,\n\n164\n00:09:04.145 --> 00:09:07.650\nnotice that is just condenses it down,\nit just makes it a little less.\n\n165\n00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.575\nIt's almost like a single\nspaces versus double spaces,\n\n166\n00:09:10.575 --> 00:09:13.910\nthat's really all we've got\ngoing on there with that one.\n\n167\n00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.280\nAnd if you're chatting with\na bunch of different people,\n\n168\n00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:22.150\nyou might wanna keep that as one line so\nI can go back and forth to there.\n\n169\n00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:26.140\nThere was one other option in\nhere that I wanted to point out\n\n170\n00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.220\nwhere it says change font.\n\n171\n00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.250\nWell this is like what we did last time.\n\n172\n00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:36.040\nBut, if you change it here,\nyou're changing it for\n\n173\n00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.320\nevery message that comes in,\nthat when you start typing,\n\n174\n00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.165\nit will always be pink and what have you.\n\n175\n00:09:44.165 --> 00:09:45.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So those are the different things.\n\n176\n00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:49.800\nAnd notice it says,\nApply settings to incoming messages.\n\n177\n00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.480\nSo that means, just like it says,\nany message, it will type in.\n\n178\n00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.100\nWhen you start typing,\nit will be in that color.\n\n179\n00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.680\nBut if I'm here in my multiple chats, like\nif I wanted to send something to Taylor\n\n180\n00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:07.420\nin, let's go with,\nI'm gonna send something in a red, right?\n\n181\n00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:11.020\nAnd I'll say, like, Team Ninja!\n\n182\n00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:11.970\nYeah!\n\n183\n00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.940\nThat was supposed to be\nthe exclamation point, but\n\n184\n00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.090\nI gave you a tilde there [LAUGH].\n\n185\n00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:20.340\nSo, now you can see that I'm\ntyping in red with Taylor, but\n\n186\n00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:27.050\nif I come over to Marisha and\nI wanna change that font here to pink, and\n\n187\n00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:33.745\nI can be like pink text to Marisha,\nnotice that that's going to keep going.\n\n188\n00:10:33.745 --> 00:10:35.655\nAnd I could keep on going with you,\nRonnie.\n\n189\n00:10:35.655 --> 00:10:38.565\nYou know, I don't wanna leave you\nout of the party there, Ronnie.\n\n190\n00:10:38.565 --> 00:10:41.805\nSo why don't I go ahead and\nI'm gonna give you blue.\n\n191\n00:10:41.805 --> 00:10:47.025\nBlue for you, and\nnotice that I can type in different\n\n192\n00:10:47.025 --> 00:10:51.390\ncolors to different people,\nbecause they are chat-specific.\n\n193\n00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.822\nBy changing that options,\n\n194\n00:10:52.822 --> 00:10:57.070\neverybody is going to change to whatever\nthat particular setting is going to be.\n\n195\n00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:03.210\nNow, if I wanna close out of some of\nthese messages, I can go ahead and\n\n196\n00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:07.840\nclick on the little x's over to\nthe right on each one of these.\n\n197\n00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.760\nLike for example,\nif I wanted to stop talking to Marisha for\n\n198\n00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.290\nwhatever reason,\nI could go ahead and close this.\n\n199\n00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.570\nAnd notice that Ronnie and\nTaylor are still hanging out.\n\n200\n00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.200\nI tend to do this.\n\n201\n00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.160\nI always go over here when\nI tab conversations and\n\n202\n00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.510\nI forget I have multiples.\n\n203\n00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.390\nThe nice thing is wait,\nwait, wait, hold on.\n\n204\n00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:31.120\nDid you want to close everything, or\njust the current one that you're on?\n\n205\n00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.970\nThe last one it looks like,\nI left it off on Taylor.\n\n206\n00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.540\nSo if I said Close current tab,\nit would be that particular one,\n\n207\n00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.760\nbecause that was the last one I was on.\n\n208\n00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.690\nOr, I could close all of them.\n\n209\n00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.240\nAlso notice that you have\nthe Always close all tabs.\n\n210\n00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.160\nIt's like, hey, stop asking me.\n\n211\n00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.780\nI know better, if I click that top\nx it's gonna close everything down.\n\n212\n00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.769\nI tend to forget,\nbecause I'm usually doing shortcuts for\n\n213\n00:11:54.769 --> 00:11:56.745\ncontrol-W for close a window.\n\n214\n00:11:56.745 --> 00:11:57.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n215\n00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.228\n&gt;&gt; So that's something you\nmight want to take notice of.\n\n216\n00:12:00.228 --> 00:12:04.030\nI'm not gonna close these for right now\nbecause I want to talk about our next\n\n217\n00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:08.260\narea, which is copying messages.\n\n218\n00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.200\nSo let's just go between Taylor and\nRonnie right here.\n\n219\n00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.650\nIf I wanted to say hiya, like,\n\n220\n00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:19.410\nI think that's a really profound statement\nand I would like to send this to Ronnie.\n\n221\n00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.060\nThey're like, hey, Taylor said,\nda da da da da, right?\n\n222\n00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.258\nThere's two things.\n\n223\n00:12:24.258 --> 00:12:29.080\nIf I right-click over, now, you don't\nhave to select it, there's no reason to\n\n224\n00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:34.210\nselect it cuz it's the whole message\nthat I'm wanting to copy right now.\n\n225\n00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.000\nAnd if I only wanted to select\njust that one little part,\n\n226\n00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.030\nthen that's a little bit different.\n\n227\n00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.180\nSo I'm gonna take this, and\nI'm going to right-click on this, and\n\n228\n00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.450\nI have Copy, and I have Copy Message.\n\n229\n00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.850\nSame thing, isn't it?\n\n230\n00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:48.990\nActually, no, it's not.\n\n231\n00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:54.040\nIf I copy the message, and\nthen come over to Ronnie.\n\n232\n00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.970\nAnd now I'm gonna right-click on here,\njust so you could see that.\n\n233\n00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.790\nI'm gonna just paste, there is paste\nunformatted but for right now,\n\n234\n00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.750\nI'm just paste as regular.\n\n235\n00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.445\nI'm gonna take this and I just paste in.\n\n236\n00:13:04.445 --> 00:13:05.920\nHiya!\n\n237\n00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.210\nThat's all there is.\n\n238\n00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.800\nOkay, wonderful.\n\n239\n00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.170\nAnd if I wanted to, I could go ahead and\nselect just that one part.\n\n240\n00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:14.720\nOops, just that one part.\n\n241\n00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.550\nThen I could go ahead and now,\nwatch if I copy the message,\n\n242\n00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:22.340\nsend this over to Ronnie,\nit's just the one piece.\n\n243\n00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:26.130\nSo I don't want you to think that\nyou have to get the entire thing.\n\n244\n00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.930\nYou can pick out one little part of it,\n\n245\n00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:33.110\ncuz maybe it was just one sentence\nthat Taylor had said to me that\n\n246\n00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:38.830\nI really wanna pass on to you,\nso parts or the whole thing.\n\n247\n00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:42.670\nBut, the biggest thing with that,\nif I go back over to Taylor.\n\n248\n00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.080\nI'll go with the whole thing.\n\n249\n00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:50.560\nGonna right-click and I do copy,\njust straight copy, not copy message.\n\n250\n00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.090\nCome back over to Ronnie.\n\n251\n00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.840\nCome over here and I paste.\n\n252\n00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.320\nLook what happens.\n\n253\n00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.180\nIt gives me the date and the time.\n\n254\n00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.642\nSo it timestamps this, tells it, or\n\n255\n00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:08.950\nbrings in who actually said that,\nand then the message.\n\n256\n00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.580\nWhoa okay, so\nthere's also morals to the story.\n\n257\n00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.110\nBe very careful about what you\ntype in your instant messages\n\n258\n00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.950\nto people within your work\nforce because guess what?\n\n259\n00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.265\nThey can say, no, look,\nthis is what the person said.\n\n260\n00:14:21.265 --> 00:14:23.390\n[LAUGH] Be a little careful about that,\nokay?\n\n261\n00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.430\nAlways keep it right up there.\n\n262\n00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:31.200\nSo now, if I do that, it is going to\nsend to Ronnie all of that information.\n\n263\n00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:37.390\nSo the copy, lots more of the metadata,\nif you wanna say.\n\n264\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.500\nThe copy message is just\nthe content of that message,\n\n265\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.710\nwhether it be selected or not selected.\n\n266\n00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.230\nAnd always, you should make sure,\n\n267\n00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.960\nbefore you send something, make sure\nthat's exactly what you wanna say,\n\n268\n00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.850\ncuz as soon as it's written down,\nas soon as it's chatted, it's real.\n\n269\n00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:57.200\nSo [LAUGH] you can't\nbackspace out of that.\n\n270\n00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.400\nIt just doesn't work.\n\n271\n00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.988\nJust a life lesson, really,\nright there [LAUGH].\n\n272\n00:15:01.988 --> 00:15:02.530\n&gt;&gt; Really.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n273\n00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:07.177\nwe've got those different ways of copying\nand pasting and knowing what to do.\n\n274\n00:15:07.177 --> 00:15:12.094\nI will say that there is a option,\nhere, that notice it says when copying,\n\n275\n00:15:12.094 --> 00:15:14.134\ndo I want to copy message only?\n\n276\n00:15:14.134 --> 00:15:18.044\nCuz maybe I don't ever want\nto ever have the timestamp.\n\n277\n00:15:18.044 --> 00:15:22.574\nI'll tell you, I've changed this,\neven did a restart in the whole night.\n\n278\n00:15:22.574 --> 00:15:26.590\nIt still went ahead and\nkept bringing in the timestamps.\n\n279\n00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.650\nEven though I told in\nthe options to stop doing that.\n\n280\n00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.970\nNot really sure, but-\n&gt;&gt; This is because of the way the entire\n\n281\n00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:37.130\nconversation is kept and stored somewhere.\n\n282\n00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:42.200\nSo inside of Office 365,\nwhich Skype for Business is a part of,\n\n283\n00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.660\nnormally what happens, and Vonne you may\nhave actually seen this before as well,\n\n284\n00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.550\nwhen a conversation is done that you've\nhad with either multiple people or\n\n285\n00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.244\none person,\nyou normally get a copy of it where?\n\n286\n00:15:52.244 --> 00:15:53.563\n&gt;&gt; In your conversations.\n\n287\n00:15:53.563 --> 00:15:55.538\n&gt;&gt; In your conversations, but\nalso in your email sometimes.\n\n288\n00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:56.272\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n289\n00:15:56.272 --> 00:15:59.002\n&gt;&gt; And so, in your emails,\nyou're receiving it.\n\n290\n00:15:59.002 --> 00:16:03.130\nAnd so in the background, it's making\na copy of the entire conversation and\n\n291\n00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.430\nsending it as an email.\n\n292\n00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.270\nAnd the emails have timestamps on them,\ntoo, so\n\n293\n00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.980\nif you don't override that\nglobal setting there,\n\n294\n00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.930\nwhich I don't think you can, then it can\neven override stuff like this sometimes.\n\n295\n00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:21.120\nSo, yes, it will cause a little bit of a\nheadache at times when you're doing this,\n\n296\n00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.130\nbut at the same time it should\nlet you know something, okay?\n\n297\n00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:30.090\nIs that everything that you're sending,\nit is recorded somewhere.\n\n298\n00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:34.740\nAnd that's something you've got\nto kind of wrap your mind around,\n\n299\n00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:39.550\nbecause it means this is not the place for\nyou to decide this is\n\n300\n00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:43.560\nonly a private message between Vonne and\nmyself and we're working for a company.\n\n301\n00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.715\nIt means somebody, such as system admin,\ncan go in there and go, conversation\n\n302\n00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:51.970\nVonne, Ronnie, use those as search\nparameters and guess what, find them all.\n\n303\n00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:53.665\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,\n\n304\n00:16:53.665 --> 00:16:56.925\nthese are ones that you do\nhave to be very careful.\n\n305\n00:16:56.925 --> 00:17:01.571\nThere's certain conversations that Marisha\nand I have that I don't do through Skype.\n\n306\n00:17:01.571 --> 00:17:02.081\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n307\n00:17:02.081 --> 00:17:03.035\n&gt;&gt; We do it through\n\n308\n00:17:03.035 --> 00:17:05.605\na regular text message,\nwhich still has all the records in it.\n\n309\n00:17:05.605 --> 00:17:07.955\nBut I mean, it's just one of\nthose things where it's like,\n\n310\n00:17:07.955 --> 00:17:12.060\nI know that there are not things that I\nneed be sending through my work Skype.\n\n311\n00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:16.200\nThen I'll go ahead and\ndo my personal messaging, and\n\n312\n00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.130\nso don't cross those streams, no.\n\n313\n00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.200\n&gt;&gt; No. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; We will talk about\nwhere all those are stored and\n\n314\n00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.400\nhow to delete them, but\nthere is that global setting, yeah.\n\n315\n00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.750\n&gt;&gt; There's archives somewhere.\n\n316\n00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.285\n&gt;&gt; Anything you do in your network.\n\n317\n00:17:27.285 --> 00:17:28.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They will be able to find it,\n\n318\n00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.830\nI don't care how much you wanna try and-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's archives somewhere.\n\n319\n00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:35.974\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can try and cover your tracks\nbut, techies like you, they'll get you.\n\n320\n00:17:35.974 --> 00:17:37.375\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n321\n00:17:37.375 --> 00:17:40.590\nalways be very,very\nconscientious about that.\n\n322\n00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:44.755\nI love all these moral lessons we're\nthrowing out in our episode today.\n\n323\n00:17:44.755 --> 00:17:46.580\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a good one to remember because\n\n324\n00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.990\nit's easy to think that this is your\npersonal private conversation, and in\n\n325\n00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:55.810\nreality, if you're working for a business,\nit's their personal and their information.\n\n326\n00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:56.471\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n327\n00:17:56.471 --> 00:17:57.111\n&gt;&gt; So just be aware.\n\n328\n00:17:57.111 --> 00:17:59.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n329\n00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:03.550\nSo let's talk a little bit\nabout the group chats here.\n\n330\n00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:07.999\nSo I'm going to close out of, you know,\nwhile I'm here, just a really quick one,\n\n331\n00:18:07.999 --> 00:18:10.630\nsee where it says Hide Pictures in IM?\n\n332\n00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:15.013\nWhat that means is the picture,\nlike the person's face.\n\n333\n00:18:15.013 --> 00:18:18.170\nLike, if I was chatting with Joey.\n\n334\n00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:22.580\nLet me come over here, because Joey,\nnotice none of the other people have their\n\n335\n00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.970\nphotos in here because of\nthe external context and everything.\n\n336\n00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:30.310\nIf I open up Joey, and then,\nactually let's go ahead and pop him out.\n\n337\n00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:34.432\nWe'll take him, and\nthen we go ahead type, and notice.\n\n338\n00:18:34.432 --> 00:18:35.831\nIf you don't mind, can you?\n\n339\n00:18:35.831 --> 00:18:36.378\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n340\n00:18:36.378 --> 00:18:37.959\n&gt;&gt; BVB.\nI don't know what.\n\n341\n00:18:37.959 --> 00:18:40.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Can you have Joey just say something\n\n342\n00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:44.920\nback really quick so we can go ahead and\nget his little picture up?\n\n343\n00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.800\nBecause when I go ahead and\nget Joey up in here,\n\n344\n00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.500\nit's gonna have his little\nphotograph next to what he types in.\n\n345\n00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.130\nThis guy's on a wireless, so it might\ntake a little bit for it to come through.\n\n346\n00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.190\nOr [LAUGH] as we just sit here and\nbe like [LAUGH] is it gonna come?\n\n347\n00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.462\nThere it is, okay, brb.\n\n348\n00:19:02.462 --> 00:19:04.980\n[LAUGH] Notice those\nlittle faces right there?\n\n349\n00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:10.040\nWith my setting,\nif I turn that IM to hide the pictures and\n\n350\n00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.935\nthen click okay, notice that it\njust takes the photograph away.\n\n351\n00:19:13.935 --> 00:19:17.825\nMight just be a little distracting in\nthere as you're going back and forth.\n\n352\n00:19:17.825 --> 00:19:20.870\nAnd since it was just kinda staring\nme in the face in that options,\n\n353\n00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.655\n[LAUGH] I figured I'd go ahead and\nhit that up.\n\n354\n00:19:23.655 --> 00:19:25.555\nRight when I said,\nlet's move on to something else!\n\n355\n00:19:25.555 --> 00:19:26.598\nAnd then I don't.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n356\n00:19:26.598 --> 00:19:27.335\n&gt;&gt; But you know,\n\n357\n00:19:27.335 --> 00:19:28.959\nwe do that from time to time.\n\n358\n00:19:28.959 --> 00:19:29.916\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n359\n00:19:29.916 --> 00:19:31.825\nI'm gonna turn that back on.\n\n360\n00:19:31.825 --> 00:19:32.945\nPlus Joey's the only one that has it.\n\n361\n00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.410\nLet's go in to group chat.\n\n362\n00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:36.200\nOkay, perfect.\n\n363\n00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:36.930\nRight here, you know what?\n\n364\n00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:41.610\nWe'll stay with Joey, as well,\nand I have this popped out.\n\n365\n00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:46.785\nSo, I am having a conversation\nwith just Joey, and\n\n366\n00:19:46.785 --> 00:19:49.925\nwe're talking about things,\nwhere we're talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.\n\n367\n00:19:49.925 --> 00:19:51.455\nThere you go.\n\n368\n00:19:51.455 --> 00:19:54.555\nJust have one extra line in there.\n\n369\n00:19:54.555 --> 00:19:57.835\nBut I realize that as we're\ntalking that I really need to\n\n370\n00:19:57.835 --> 00:20:00.945\nbring in somebody else into\nthe conversation, right?\n\n371\n00:20:00.945 --> 00:20:05.745\nIt's kinda like when you get CC'd in\nan email thread like, maybe 15 emails in,\n\n372\n00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.760\nand you get the whole\nconversation [LAUGH].\n\n373\n00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.810\nSo up here this Participants.\n\n374\n00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:14.890\nThis is where I can invite more people.\n\n375\n00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.130\nNow you notice there's\na button right here.\n\n376\n00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.210\nThere's also a button right here.\n\n377\n00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:23.630\nThere's also one other way that I\ncan bring in somebody else into\n\n378\n00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:29.230\nthe conversation, that's just dragging\nfrom Skype into the chat or the IM window.\n\n379\n00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.920\nSo either which way you want to do it.\n\n380\n00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.295\nI'm gonna invite, let's go ahead and bring\nin Marisha in this conversation cuz I'm\n\n381\n00:20:36.295 --> 00:20:38.322\nsure she would love to be a part of this.\n\n382\n00:20:38.322 --> 00:20:39.170\nAll right?\n\n383\n00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:43.430\nSo now,\nnotice that I've got three participants.\n\n384\n00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:50.198\nAs soon as,\nwelcome to the group chat marisha.\n\n385\n00:20:50.198 --> 00:20:53.010\nI should capitalize Marisha.\n\n386\n00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.420\nThere we go.\nAnd so\n\n387\n00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.390\nnow we've got this group chat going.\n\n388\n00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:00.916\nAnd so we can go ahead and go back and\nforth and everything like that.\n\n389\n00:21:00.916 --> 00:21:08.470\nSo, when you bring in one more person,\nlook at the Participants pane.\n\n390\n00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:13.560\nIt turns into a complete,\nwell not completely, it adds a new button.\n\n391\n00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.210\nWhat it adds is participant actions.\n\n392\n00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:20.840\nYou've now turned this into a meeting,\nif we want to say.\n\n393\n00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.450\nRemember this button\ndown here at the bottom?\n\n394\n00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.130\nWhoops, sorry.\n\n395\n00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.500\nI didn't mean to do that [LAUGH].\n\n396\n00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.670\nRight there, our More Options button?\n\n397\n00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:30.930\nLook at what happens.\n\n398\n00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.240\nThere's new options in here.\n\n399\n00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:38.950\nIf I was just in a regular one-way\nconversation, it doesn't say anything\n\n400\n00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:45.160\nabout recording a meeting, or going in to\nending a meeting, and so on and so forth.\n\n401\n00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.280\nComing back over into here,\nI've got different options.\n\n402\n00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:54.830\nSo as soon as two becomes three,\nyou get into meeting settings.\n\n403\n00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:57.600\nAnd just wanted to point that out.\n\n404\n00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.720\nYou think it's just a group chat, we're\njust IMing, we're not having a meeting.\n\n405\n00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.850\nIn the eyes of Skype for Business,\nit treats it a little differently.\n\n406\n00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:09.360\nCuz now that you have\nmultiple participants,\n\n407\n00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.920\nyou could change participant status,\ndo all sorts of different things.\n\n408\n00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.310\nThere's some different things in this\nParticipant Actions that we will cover in\n\n409\n00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:22.040\ndepth in our meetings episode,\nwhich is showing like what people can do,\n\n410\n00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:27.300\nhow you can start changing people from\ndifferent statuses into an attendee\n\n411\n00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:32.800\nversus a presenter,\nbecause now we have multiple people.\n\n412\n00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.670\nSo how do you manage\nthose multiple people?\n\n413\n00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:38.500\nThat's where you get into\nyour meeting settings.\n\n414\n00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.500\nSo just throwing that out there,\nand that's how you can do it.\n\n415\n00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:46.790\nNow, what if I wanted to add in one\nmore person in this group conversation?\n\n416\n00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:49.310\nMaybe I'll go ahead and bring in Renee.\n\n417\n00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.330\nI don't wanna do the invite more people,\n\n418\n00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:55.170\nI don't wanna click this little\nbutton over here, either.\n\n419\n00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:59.610\nSorry this is starting to,\nI didn't want this to get too confusing.\n\n420\n00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:02.541\nSo now I've got multiple buttons\nnow going everywhere [LAUGH].\n\n421\n00:23:02.541 --> 00:23:04.164\nIf I wanna bring Mirnish, Ramrisha?\n\n422\n00:23:04.164 --> 00:23:05.835\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Renee?\n\n423\n00:23:05.835 --> 00:23:08.330\n&gt;&gt; Renee,\nthat's what I'm trying to bring in.\n\n424\n00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:11.400\nBring her in the conversation,\nI just drag and drop her.\n\n425\n00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.830\nJust click hold, drag.\n\n426\n00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:16.200\nI'm even putting her right in the chat,\nwhen I let go,\n\n427\n00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.040\nshe now becomes part of our group.\n\n428\n00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:23.450\nAnd we can say, hello to Renee.\n\n429\n00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:26.411\nYay!\n\n430\n00:23:26.411 --> 00:23:27.450\nTwo e's.\n\n431\n00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:27.950\nThere we go.\n\n432\n00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:34.670\nAnd now she is part of the group chat.\n\n433\n00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:35.890\nYay!\n\n434\n00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:38.395\nSo, you can see that I've\ngot multiple people in here.\n\n435\n00:23:38.395 --> 00:23:43.017\nNow I'm going to go ahead and\njust pop this back into the conversation,\n\n436\n00:23:43.017 --> 00:23:46.024\nbecause when I start\nhaving multiple people,\n\n437\n00:23:46.024 --> 00:23:49.357\nnotice it doesn't just turn into,\nhey, I'm-.\n\n438\n00:23:49.357 --> 00:23:51.525\nOops sorry,\nI keep grabbing the wrong thing.\n\n439\n00:23:51.525 --> 00:23:55.696\nNotice it's like, here's this\nconversation with four participants...\n\n440\n00:23:55.696 --> 00:23:59.205\nBut I can still come back in and\nchat with Ronnie.\n\n441\n00:23:59.205 --> 00:24:04.485\nOr maybe in this point,\nmaybe Taylor has decided he wants to say,\n\n442\n00:24:04.485 --> 00:24:07.660\nhey you got five more minutes, right?\n\n443\n00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:12.750\nSo if he starts typing and I'm typing with\nsomebody else, it's gonna start popping up\n\n444\n00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:17.070\ndifferent little pieces that says,\nhey, there's another person type.\n\n445\n00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:18.630\nYou have an unread message.\n\n446\n00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.881\nSo maybe actually Ronnie,\ndo you mind on our regular conversation.\n\n447\n00:24:21.881 --> 00:24:23.541\nCan we go ahead and\n\n448\n00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:29.990\ntype something else while I'm\nsaying hello to the group in here?\n\n449\n00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:34.250\nSo I'm in this one conversation,\nand I'm talking and everything.\n\n450\n00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.920\nAnd Ronnie has said, and\nit's just a little bit too big.\n\n451\n00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.600\nNotice right there I have\nan unread message right there.\n\n452\n00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.590\nSo it's letting me know that you\ngot something right in there, and\n\n453\n00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:46.720\nif I click it.\n\n454\n00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.705\nAnd then I click on the button, there it\nis, it switched me right over to Ronnie.\n\n455\n00:24:51.705 --> 00:24:55.983\nI will say that you might also see\nlittle numbers off to the side\n\n456\n00:24:55.983 --> 00:24:59.612\nof little number ones or\nlittle buttons over there.\n\n457\n00:24:59.612 --> 00:25:01.760\nThat just lets you know\nhere in the chat or\n\n458\n00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.135\nin the tabs that somebody else is talking\nto you, so you can switch back and forth.\n\n459\n00:25:06.135 --> 00:25:09.175\nSo it'll let you know when you\nhave other things going on.\n\n460\n00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.330\nBack into our group chat, what if I\nhave decided that, you know what?\n\n461\n00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:21.760\nI don't know if I really want Joey\nin this conversation anymore, right?\n\n462\n00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.020\nI want him to go away.\n\n463\n00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.380\nSo notice that I brought\nup my conversation,\n\n464\n00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.590\nI went into the participants pane.\n\n465\n00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:32.120\nAnd with Joey to take him out,\nI just right click and\n\n466\n00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.682\nI remove him from the meeting.\n\n467\n00:25:34.682 --> 00:25:39.105\nYes, it's still a conversation, we're\nstill talking, but it is now a meeting.\n\n468\n00:25:39.105 --> 00:25:43.688\nAnd so now you can say, [LAUGH] that\nnow he is gone away, and sorry Joey,\n\n469\n00:25:43.688 --> 00:25:46.820\nyou have left the building, you are gone.\n\n470\n00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:51.102\nIf I wanted to, let's say remove Marisha,\n\n471\n00:25:51.102 --> 00:25:56.563\nI can take Marisha out, and\nnow it's just me and Renee.\n\n472\n00:25:56.563 --> 00:26:00.150\nYes, so now you can see that I've\nremoved some different people out.\n\n473\n00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:03.650\n&gt;&gt; And Vonne,\non Joey's end right here on his computer,\n\n474\n00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:06.790\nthere's a yellow bar that appears that\nsays you were removed from the meeting.\n\n475\n00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.952\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you do get a status update\nfrom there and actually I believe how\n\n476\n00:26:09.952 --> 00:26:11.896\nabout you start a group chat-\n&gt;&gt; Let's see.\n\n477\n00:26:11.896 --> 00:26:17.892\n&gt;&gt; With me, and then we can see it as\nyou remove JT from the meeting and\n\n478\n00:26:17.892 --> 00:26:21.064\nwhat that actually looks like so.\n\n479\n00:26:21.064 --> 00:26:24.685\nAnd I've decided that we're gonna go\nahead and close this conversation out, so\n\n480\n00:26:24.685 --> 00:26:26.030\nI'm going to close that tab.\n\n481\n00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.920\nAlso, now okay,\n\n482\n00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.390\nI've got it just behind my head you can\nsee that I've got a group conversation.\n\n483\n00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:36.810\nSo that's another thing that you\ncan see when you're being IMed,\n\n484\n00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.050\nit's from Ronnie, but\nit says group conversation.\n\n485\n00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:44.490\nSo I know automatically that this\nisn't just a two-way conversation.\n\n486\n00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:47.105\nSo I'll go ahead and accept that, and\n\n487\n00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:51.123\nI can see that I have been\nbrought into this conversation.\n\n488\n00:26:51.123 --> 00:26:54.320\nAnd I'm just gonna go ahead and\npop this out so we can see it.\n\n489\n00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.499\nNotice that we've got,\nthis is with Ronnie and Joey, so\n\n490\n00:26:58.499 --> 00:27:01.909\nI know that I'm on the group,\nyay, perfect.\n\n491\n00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:05.520\nAnd I can still click on this\nbecause I am a presenter right now.\n\n492\n00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.548\nWhen we get into if you don't\nwant people to do this, so\n\n493\n00:27:09.548 --> 00:27:13.126\nwe can talk about attendees and\ndifferent levels of participation.\n\n494\n00:27:13.126 --> 00:27:16.863\nSo Ronnie, why don't you go ahead and\nkick JT out of this meeting right here.\n\n495\n00:27:16.863 --> 00:27:19.997\nSo would you go ahead and\nremove, and look,\n\n496\n00:27:19.997 --> 00:27:23.670\nI was removed from the meeting,\nthat's sad.\n\n497\n00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:26.890\nSo now you can see that that's what\nyou will get on the receiving end\n\n498\n00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:29.500\nof your conversation.\n\n499\n00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.800\nSo different things to look at when\nyou're doing your group chats, and\n\n500\n00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.840\nI think I have a couple more up here.\n\n501\n00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.659\nSo how you can manage multiple chats or\n\n502\n00:27:39.659 --> 00:27:43.544\nconversations with people\nhaving group messages.\n\n503\n00:27:43.544 --> 00:27:47.950\nThe copy and past and\nthen if you're seeing unread messages,\n\n504\n00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:50.756\nthen it's usually down at the bottom.\n\n505\n00:27:50.756 --> 00:27:54.432\nAnd then you can go ahead and click it and\nthen see those different ones.\n\n506\n00:27:54.432 --> 00:27:56.818\nAgain it might be over towards the left,\nthat would be the other left,\n\n507\n00:27:56.818 --> 00:27:57.673\nthat would be the right.\n\n508\n00:27:57.673 --> 00:27:59.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n509\n00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.205\n&gt;&gt; Of where it's kinda giving you little\n\n510\n00:28:01.205 --> 00:28:06.195\nbuttons and then right here, it also gives\nme, look, hey we saved this conversation.\n\n511\n00:28:06.195 --> 00:28:09.136\nYou'll see this in the conversation for\nSkype for Business.\n\n512\n00:28:09.136 --> 00:28:13.762\nAnd you'll also see this in Outlook which\nwe will talk about a little bit more\n\n513\n00:28:13.762 --> 00:28:15.580\nin depth in the next episode.\n\n514\n00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.800\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nclose all of them.\n\n515\n00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:23.490\nYes, I do wanna close all my chats and\nmy IMs with everybody, so you know\n\n516\n00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:29.010\nit's a lot of window management, just\nknowing where you are before you type.\n\n517\n00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:32.570\nAnd hey, really more before\nyou hit that send button.\n\n518\n00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:35.752\nAm I in the right chat-\n&gt;&gt; With the right person.\n\n519\n00:28:35.752 --> 00:28:41.104\n&gt;&gt; With the right person, understanding\nhow groups do change a little bit.\n\n520\n00:28:41.104 --> 00:28:44.455\nAnd then you can control more options\nfrom there because you really do\n\n521\n00:28:44.455 --> 00:28:45.270\nhave a meeting.\n\n522\n00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:49.853\nSo I believe we've covered everything\non that, multiple instant messages.\n\n523\n00:28:49.853 --> 00:28:51.625\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you again, Vonne, for\n\n524\n00:28:51.625 --> 00:28:54.580\nhelping us to understand\nthis a little bit better.\n\n525\n00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.870\nIt is easy to think just because we know\nhow to chat with one person doesn't mean\n\n526\n00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.631\nthat we can't mismanage that.\n\n527\n00:29:00.631 --> 00:29:03.518\nWhen we start chatting with multiple\npeople at the same time and\n\n528\n00:29:03.518 --> 00:29:07.780\nthen forgetting that we're actually not\nsupposed to say things to certain people.\n\n529\n00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:11.520\nSo Vonne has showed us we've gotta be\nvery careful at how we manage that\n\n530\n00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.190\nas well as introducing us of\ncourse to the group chat.\n\n531\n00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.350\nAnd the options that are available there,\n\n532\n00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:19.530\nespecially if we wanna remove someone\nfrom that group chat as well.\n\n533\n00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:23.270\nSo this is a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n534\n00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:26.880\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n535\n00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.830\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n536\n00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:32.086\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Skype for Business episodes.\n\n537\n00:29:32.086 --> 00:29:39.600\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.250\nYou're watching the Skype for\nBusiness show.\n\n4\n00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.110\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong and today,\nwe're gonna be taking a look at the idea\n\n5\n00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.720\nhere of managing instant\nmessage conversations.\n\n6\n00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.030\nAnd here to help us,\nof course, is going to be,\n\n7\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.000\nwell, the OfficePro wizard herself,\nMiss Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.020\nVonne, welcome back to the show,\nhow are you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.200\n&gt;&gt; It was almost like, wait, did he pause?\n\n10\n00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.720\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n11\n00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.630\n&gt;&gt; Did we freeze frame for a second?\n\n12\n00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.537\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we did.\n&gt;&gt; You're really good at that.\n\n13\n00:00:40.537 --> 00:00:41.263\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n14\n00:00:41.263 --> 00:00:42.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.374\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, so here we are,\nwe're at this idea where we've now taken\n\n16\n00:00:46.374 --> 00:00:50.873\na look at using instant messaging between\ntwo users at the same time or at least,\n\n17\n00:00:50.873 --> 00:00:55.439\nbetween two users and then, of course,\nmultiple users inside of a group chat and\n\n18\n00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:58.960\nsaw some of the interface and\ndifferences that appear there.\n\n19\n00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.180\nBut now we're talking about the idea\nof the conversation, so Vonne,\n\n20\n00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.160\nwhat are we looking at here?\n\n21\n00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is an episode that I wanted\nto talk about just the different options,\n\n22\n00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.200\nthe different statuses and\nhow when you contact people,\n\n23\n00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.460\nwhat messages you will see when you're\ntrying to instant message somebody that,\n\n24\n00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.110\nmaybe, might not be there,\nwhat is a missed conversation?\n\n25\n00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.920\nAnd then, we're gonna talk a little bit\nabout, like, where is all these going?\n\n26\n00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.125\n[LAUGH] And where can I go and delete my\ninstant messages and is it really gone?\n\n27\n00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:35.120\n[LAUGH] So,\nwe'll have a little conversation,\n\n28\n00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.126\nwe'll have an actual conversation-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n29\n00:01:37.126 --> 00:01:38.480\n&gt;&gt; About that-\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n30\n00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.570\n&gt;&gt; So, why don't we start with\nthe missed conversations,\n\n31\n00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.750\nit's just like if somebody called you and\nyou weren't there.\n\n32\n00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.930\nIt's on my phone, I have a little button\nat the bottom, where I'm in my phone,\n\n33\n00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.265\nit has missed calls.\n\n34\n00:01:50.265 --> 00:01:51.970\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, I look at that and\n\n35\n00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.210\nI can see that I've missed certain calls\nand some I didn't answer on purpose,\n\n36\n00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.090\ncuz I didn't wanna talk to that person or\n\n37\n00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.695\nreally, it's like, I don't recognize\nthat number, I'm not picking this up.\n\n38\n00:02:01.695 --> 00:02:04.200\n[LAUGH] If it's important,\nthey'll leave a message.\n\n39\n00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.290\nSo, I kind of go with that model there,\nRonnie, I don't just pick up any phone.\n\n40\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.360\nAnd usually, when I do,\nit reinforces the fact that like, nope,\n\n41\n00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.410\nthis is why I don't answer\nnumbers I don't know about,\n\n42\n00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.350\ncuz it's usually some telemarketer or\nsomething like that.\n\n43\n00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.070\nSo, if I have a missed conversation,\nit's because,\n\n44\n00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.340\nmaybe, I'm not logged in and\nsomebody's messaging me.\n\n45\n00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.198\nAnd I'll still get it, I just don't see\nit right away, because I'm not there.\n\n46\n00:02:32.198 --> 00:02:36.946\n[LAUGH] Why don't we jump down\ninto Justin's computer right here,\n\n47\n00:02:36.946 --> 00:02:41.773\nyou can see that I've got it to where\nI signed out of Skype and I know,\n\n48\n00:02:41.773 --> 00:02:43.837\nbecause I asked you to do it.\n\n49\n00:02:43.837 --> 00:02:48.533\n[LAUGH] I had Joey Skype\nour instant message JT, so,\n\n50\n00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:54.105\nwhen I sign in what's gonna happen\nis I get a little red number\n\n51\n00:02:54.105 --> 00:03:01.260\nup there that's just saying, that,\nhey, I got a missed conversation.\n\n52\n00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.930\nSo, if I click on this and\nit also, hovers, it says,\n\n53\n00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.500\nI have one missed conversation and\n\n54\n00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.460\nyou can see, that I've actually got\na couple, because I was testing this out.\n\n55\n00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.130\nNope, nope missed [LAUGH] cuz\nI control that computer, too.\n\n56\n00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.970\nSo, I've got Joe and it says,\nhey, wanna grab coffee?\n\n57\n00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.820\nI've got the little red dump number here,\n\n58\n00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.690\nso, if I have a lot of them,\nthey'll go ahead and give me that.\n\n59\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.180\nIf I open this up,\nI can double click it and\n\n60\n00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.160\nI can go ahead and respond and\nbe like, I'm back and I could say,\n\n61\n00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.080\nlike, sure, after the show.\n\n62\n00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.030\nAnd now, I've gone ahead and\nstarted the conversation back up with it.\n\n63\n00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.970\nSo, you can open up your missed\nconversations right from that particular\n\n64\n00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.058\ntab within our Skype for Business and we\ncan go ahead and start our conversation.\n\n65\n00:03:51.058 --> 00:03:56.154\nWonderful, so, now,\nthis is something that Joey\n\n66\n00:03:56.154 --> 00:04:00.910\nactually saw when he theoretically,\n\n67\n00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.140\nwent ahead and did all this,\nbecause you have your statuses,\n\n68\n00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.060\nlet's go look over here at my contacts.\n\n69\n00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.190\nIf I go into this one, like, I know\nthat I'm not logged in right now on my\n\n70\n00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.210\nregular ITProTV account, so, you can see,\nit says, Offline, not online,\n\n71\n00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.020\nso, that shows me an indication that\nthis person's not gonna receive it, but\n\n72\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.420\nlet me go ahead and open this up and\ntry to chat, but it says, look,\n\n73\n00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.824\nVonne Smith is offline, but they'll\nstill get your IMs as missed messages.\n\n74\n00:04:36.824 --> 00:04:41.215\nCool, so, you're being alerted\nthat it's still gonna get through,\n\n75\n00:04:41.215 --> 00:04:44.240\nthey are just not connected right now.\n\n76\n00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.280\nSo, you could see it on both sides\nwhen you receive missed messages or\n\n77\n00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.630\nif you're going to be sending\na message to somebody,\n\n78\n00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.400\nthat's gonna end up\nbeing a missed message.\n\n79\n00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.190\nAnd if they miss those,\nthen don't always fault them, but\n\n80\n00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.190\nnow you know that, hey, I know where\nto look, in case somebody's like,\n\n81\n00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.314\nhey, I went ahead and IMed you,\nbut you never IMed me back.\n\n82\n00:05:10.314 --> 00:05:13.181\nI didn't see it, yeah, no,\nyou just didn't know where to look.\n\n83\n00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:14.194\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n84\n00:05:14.194 --> 00:05:17.167\n&gt;&gt; Or you on purpose didn't wanna,\n\n85\n00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:18.446\nIM them back.\n\n86\n00:05:18.446 --> 00:05:21.550\n[LAUGH] So, those are some of\nthe different things that happen.\n\n87\n00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:28.130\nNow, the other thing that I wanna\ncover in here is that, Do Not Disturb.\n\n88\n00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.150\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's kind of a big one.\n\n89\n00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.527\nSo, let's go ahead, I'm gonna start\na conversation with Joey, right and\n\n90\n00:05:33.527 --> 00:05:37.200\nJoey's, were talking,\nright and we're doing good.\n\n91\n00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.530\nBut, maybe, he went ahead and\nsaw that I chatted him and I would, if\n\n92\n00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.315\nyou don't mind, Ronnie, can you set Joey's\nstatus to Do Not Disturb, right now?\n\n93\n00:05:45.315 --> 00:05:51.935\n[LAUGH] Now, this might be another\nindication that like, hey, do not disturb.\n\n94\n00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:55.395\nOoh, okay, I got it, loud and clear.\n\n95\n00:05:55.395 --> 00:06:00.210\n[LAUGH] But look at what it says,\nJoey has set the Do Not Disturb.\n\n96\n00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:07.435\nBased on their settings, they may\nstill get your IMs as missed messages.\n\n97\n00:06:07.435 --> 00:06:12.962\n[LAUGH] So, it's gonna go back into\nthe whole idea of they'll get it,\n\n98\n00:06:12.962 --> 00:06:16.210\nbut it'll be a missed message.\n\n99\n00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.570\nBut depending on their settings,\n\n100\n00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.910\nthat's why we talked about\nour privacy relationships.\n\n101\n00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:25.300\nYou can have it to where people could\nstill get through to you, even though,\n\n102\n00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.390\nyou put the Do Not Disturb, but they\nhave to be in that work group setting.\n\n103\n00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.560\nIf they're in Colleagues, I think,\nit's Colleagues, Friends and\n\n104\n00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.100\nFamily, in external, if they're in any\nof those, they're not gonna get it.\n\n105\n00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.355\nSo, I could be like, okay,\ngot the message, Joey.\n\n106\n00:06:41.355 --> 00:06:47.460\n[LAUGH] Maybe, frowny face and\nnow you can see that it's going through.\n\n107\n00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.065\nOne other thing I actually did forget\nto mention in the basic episode,\n\n108\n00:06:52.065 --> 00:06:57.650\nif you do things like the colon and\n\n109\n00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:03.102\nthen the parenthesis, like,\na regular smiley, it will send out\n\n110\n00:07:03.102 --> 00:07:08.260\nas a smiley the same way as like,\na frown or a wink and things like that.\n\n111\n00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.955\nSo, those emoticons, they will\ntranslate into some of those regular\n\n112\n00:07:12.955 --> 00:07:16.147\ntext based ones and\nthen we'll change into it.\n\n113\n00:07:16.147 --> 00:07:21.125\nThat is in a setting, like, if you turned\nall of that off, like, I don't want to\n\n114\n00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:26.032\nsend little yellow faces, I want to have\nthe colon and the parenthesis, then go\n\n115\n00:07:26.032 --> 00:07:30.893\nahead and turn that setting off and so,\nJoey will get this as a missed message.\n\n116\n00:07:30.893 --> 00:07:35.196\nOr he might be getting them and\njust not responding to me,\n\n117\n00:07:35.196 --> 00:07:38.871\nbecause depending on his setting,\nfor me as JT,\n\n118\n00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:43.310\nthat's whether or\nnot it's going to come through.\n\n119\n00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.691\nAnd just to kinda test that\nout on the other end, right,\n\n120\n00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:50.312\nI'm here as Justin Timberlake.\n\n121\n00:07:50.312 --> 00:07:53.685\nJoey, if you don't mind,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n122\n00:07:53.685 --> 00:07:56.807\nJoey's status was set back to available.\n\n123\n00:07:56.807 --> 00:08:00.398\nAnd I'm gonna check, so\nI don't remember what I left this on.\n\n124\n00:08:00.398 --> 00:08:03.212\nI'm going to right-click\non Joey's contact and\n\n125\n00:08:03.212 --> 00:08:05.829\nI'm gonna go in to\nthe privacy relationship.\n\n126\n00:08:05.829 --> 00:08:08.411\nSo you're gonna see that he's\nas a colleague right now.\n\n127\n00:08:08.411 --> 00:08:14.220\nOn my end, as Justin Timberlake I'm\ngoing to set him in my work group,\n\n128\n00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:19.157\nwhich means he can contact me\nwith my Do Not Disturb status.\n\n129\n00:08:19.157 --> 00:08:22.087\nSo if I come into here,\nchange this Do Not Disturb,\n\n130\n00:08:22.087 --> 00:08:26.255\nnow if you don't mind Joe, why don't\nyou go ahead and try to contact me?\n\n131\n00:08:26.255 --> 00:08:30.796\nIt's gonna come up behind my\nhead in just a little bit.\n\n132\n00:08:30.796 --> 00:08:31.728\nSo you can see that.\n\n133\n00:08:31.728 --> 00:08:33.510\nLook he sent me a message.\n\n134\n00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:38.845\nEven though my Do Not Disturb is on,\nI could either reply or ignore.\n\n135\n00:08:38.845 --> 00:08:42.728\nMaybe I could reply and be like, hey,\non a super important phone call,\n\n136\n00:08:42.728 --> 00:08:44.495\ntext you later, or something.\n\n137\n00:08:44.495 --> 00:08:46.237\nSo that came through.\n\n138\n00:08:46.237 --> 00:08:48.546\nNow, I'm gonna ignore this for right now.\n\n139\n00:08:48.546 --> 00:08:52.613\nIf I change this back to,\nmy Privacy relationship as my,\n\n140\n00:08:52.613 --> 00:08:55.003\nlet's go with Colleagues here.\n\n141\n00:08:55.003 --> 00:08:59.612\nDo Not Disturb, why don't you go ahead and\ntry and send JT another little message?\n\n142\n00:08:59.612 --> 00:09:04.575\nBecause it's not gonna bring up\nanything now at the bottom because it's\n\n143\n00:09:04.575 --> 00:09:09.553\ngoing to say no cuz my relationship\nstatus with him has changed on my end.\n\n144\n00:09:09.553 --> 00:09:12.106\nSo don't get anything over here.\n\n145\n00:09:12.106 --> 00:09:15.002\nNothing, but look but what does come up.\n\n146\n00:09:15.002 --> 00:09:17.363\nCame up buzzing, it's conversation.\n\n147\n00:09:17.363 --> 00:09:21.221\nSo it does do [LAUGH],\nare you ignoring me?\n\n148\n00:09:21.221 --> 00:09:24.416\nAnd then I can open this, yes [LAUGH].\n\n149\n00:09:24.416 --> 00:09:29.296\nAnd we can go ahead and start our\nconversation up because I can bring up\n\n150\n00:09:29.296 --> 00:09:33.519\nmy missed conversations, and\nhe's sending it back to me.\n\n151\n00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:37.449\nAnd we can go ahead and\nstill have our chats between each other,\n\n152\n00:09:37.449 --> 00:09:40.057\neven though my Do Not Disturb is still on.\n\n153\n00:09:40.057 --> 00:09:42.973\nAha, because I opened this window.\n\n154\n00:09:42.973 --> 00:09:46.780\nThat's another thing to\ntake notice of here.\n\n155\n00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.511\nIt's like, well, wait,\nJoey still in the same status, yeah.\n\n156\n00:09:49.511 --> 00:09:52.743\nBut I opened it up and\nI'm having a conversation, so\n\n157\n00:09:52.743 --> 00:09:55.029\nhe will still be able to get through.\n\n158\n00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:58.910\nIf I close this then you're not gonna\nbe able to get through anymore, okay?\n\n159\n00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:04.978\nSo keeping a good understanding in your\nbrain about what that really means.\n\n160\n00:10:04.978 --> 00:10:08.293\nAnd if you really don't want\nanybody to be disturbing you,\n\n161\n00:10:08.293 --> 00:10:12.221\nyou might wanna go ahead and\nset all those people into your work group.\n\n162\n00:10:12.221 --> 00:10:15.809\nAnd maybe only giving is\nmaybe just reserve that for\n\n163\n00:10:15.809 --> 00:10:21.324\njust a few select people that we don't\nhave to keep changing it here and there.\n\n164\n00:10:21.324 --> 00:10:25.477\nBut maybe Tim is the only\none that can disturb me or\n\n165\n00:10:25.477 --> 00:10:30.339\nat least get through to me when\nI have my particular status\n\n166\n00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:34.109\nof Do Not Disturb, so\nkeeping that in mind.\n\n167\n00:10:34.109 --> 00:10:37.619\nNow along the whole line\nof your conversations, and\n\n168\n00:10:37.619 --> 00:10:41.385\nwhere is this being stored\nin my missed conversations?\n\n169\n00:10:41.385 --> 00:10:46.338\nI came over to here, and in my Missed\ntab I can open up any of these\n\n170\n00:10:46.338 --> 00:10:51.496\nthat I've missed and go ahead and\nstart the conversation again.\n\n171\n00:10:51.496 --> 00:10:54.737\nThat's the same as all\nof your conversations.\n\n172\n00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:57.376\nEvery single conversation you have,\n\n173\n00:10:57.376 --> 00:11:02.248\nwhether it is an IM, a audio call,\na video call, any of those things.\n\n174\n00:11:02.248 --> 00:11:07.389\nIf you're communicating via Skype,\nit is stored here\n\n175\n00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:13.664\nin the All tab of your conversations,\nany communication in here.\n\n176\n00:11:13.664 --> 00:11:17.827\nSo this is our tracker, our log,\nour archive, our storage,\n\n177\n00:11:17.827 --> 00:11:23.524\nhowever you wanna call it, this is where\neverything goes is in your conversations.\n\n178\n00:11:23.524 --> 00:11:28.111\nThat being said, I could come\nback up into my conversation with\n\n179\n00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:31.498\nTaylor cuz maybe I wanna\njust chat him back up.\n\n180\n00:11:31.498 --> 00:11:34.846\nI don't have to go back to my contacts,\nI can go under my conversations.\n\n181\n00:11:34.846 --> 00:11:40.008\nThis is another one that's really good\nif you wanna message Joe Schmo that\n\n182\n00:11:40.008 --> 00:11:45.519\nyou had a conversation with last week,\nbut you never added him in as a contact.\n\n183\n00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:48.245\nHe is not in this list.\n\n184\n00:11:48.245 --> 00:11:52.136\nMan, I can't remember that\nperson's email address or\n\n185\n00:11:52.136 --> 00:11:55.797\nhis Skype name, but\nI know I talked to him last week.\n\n186\n00:11:55.797 --> 00:12:00.045\nCome over here, come into your All,\nand you can open this back up.\n\n187\n00:12:00.045 --> 00:12:03.772\nNow Taylor does happen to be a contact of\nmine right now, but I can open this up,\n\n188\n00:12:03.772 --> 00:12:05.597\nand I can see everything that we said.\n\n189\n00:12:05.597 --> 00:12:08.455\nI can see the time stamps, I can see\nall of these, and I can go ahead and\n\n190\n00:12:08.455 --> 00:12:09.059\nstart again.\n\n191\n00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:13.406\nAnd it will be like, I could say, hiya.\n\n192\n00:12:13.406 --> 00:12:18.022\nCuz he wasn't saying hiya,\nhe was hi-ya, like a ninja.\n\n193\n00:12:18.022 --> 00:12:18.981\nHe was, we are.\n\n194\n00:12:18.981 --> 00:12:19.841\nTeam ninja.\n\n195\n00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:21.980\n[LAUGH] So i can bring this back up, and\n\n196\n00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:26.407\nif he's available then he could go ahead\nand chat back and so on and so forth.\n\n197\n00:12:26.407 --> 00:12:29.220\n&gt;&gt; I think we're giving ninjas\na bad name at some point.\n\n198\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:34.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Karate chop, yes exactly, perfect.\n\n199\n00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.100\n[LAUGH] So that way I could go ahead and\n\n200\n00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.713\nbring this conversation\nback up at any time.\n\n201\n00:12:40.713 --> 00:12:42.874\nEverything is logged in.\n\n202\n00:12:42.874 --> 00:12:44.139\nAlways keep that.\n\n203\n00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:48.800\nAnd I think we've tried to get\nthat point across of like anything\n\n204\n00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.613\nyou say is being seen, and\nit can be brought back up.\n\n205\n00:12:52.613 --> 00:12:57.191\nWell talk about some little,\nmore logistics in just a minute, but\n\n206\n00:12:57.191 --> 00:13:02.669\njust know that you can always come in to\nthis, open up previous conversations,\n\n207\n00:13:02.669 --> 00:13:06.466\nyour missed conversations and\nthen chat them back up.\n\n208\n00:13:06.466 --> 00:13:10.244\nOr video call them, audio call them,\nhowever you want to do that,\n\n209\n00:13:10.244 --> 00:13:14.425\nbecause I could go right here right-click\non Marissa and I can continue,\n\n210\n00:13:14.425 --> 00:13:18.825\nI have to start the conversation and\nthen click the video or the audio button.\n\n211\n00:13:18.825 --> 00:13:23.708\nAnd if I were going to have\nthat with communication.\n\n212\n00:13:23.708 --> 00:13:28.313\nYou can't do it from right-clicking\non the conversation from here,\n\n213\n00:13:28.313 --> 00:13:32.070\nnotice it's just,\nit's just not gonna let you do that.\n\n214\n00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:36.167\nThe right-clicking over here on my\ncontacts, if I really wanted to video call\n\n215\n00:13:36.167 --> 00:13:39.036\nher, as a contacts I can go ahead and\nstart it that way.\n\n216\n00:13:39.036 --> 00:13:42.838\nSo just letting you know\nthat you can do that.\n\n217\n00:13:42.838 --> 00:13:48.450\nSo let's move on into some\nother things that might happen,\n\n218\n00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.040\nwhen you try to IM someone.\n\n219\n00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.812\nAnd this kind of gets into our\nwhole network settings conversation\n\n220\n00:13:55.812 --> 00:13:58.887\nthat we're going to have about deletion.\n\n221\n00:13:58.887 --> 00:14:00.073\nDeletion?\nYeah.\n\n222\n00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:01.090\n&gt;&gt; Sure!\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can delete!\n\n223\n00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.241\n[LAUGH] My friend, Tiffany.\n\n224\n00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:07.404\nMy Tiffany works at\nthe University of Florida, right?\n\n225\n00:14:07.404 --> 00:14:10.438\nI know that she is,\nthis is a valid contact,\n\n226\n00:14:10.438 --> 00:14:14.049\nwe've talked about her in the show,\nbefore, too.\n\n227\n00:14:14.049 --> 00:14:18.087\nI tried to call her or not call her,\nI'm sorry, I tried to IM her and\n\n228\n00:14:18.087 --> 00:14:20.121\nI just need to find it right here.\n\n229\n00:14:20.121 --> 00:14:24.369\nSo notice right here if I bring\nthis up I wanted to point this out,\n\n230\n00:14:24.369 --> 00:14:28.538\nis that if I try to test it,\nhello Tiffany, test, test again,\n\n231\n00:14:28.538 --> 00:14:31.076\nI was making sure it was still broken.\n\n232\n00:14:31.076 --> 00:14:31.639\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n233\n00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:35.018\n&gt;&gt; If I say test again,\nsorry about the all caps, doesn't matter,\n\n234\n00:14:35.018 --> 00:14:36.317\nshe's not gonna get it.\n\n235\n00:14:36.317 --> 00:14:42.341\nYou could see that look at right here\nit says this message wasn't sent to or\n\n236\n00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:46.025\nemail address, due to company policy.\n\n237\n00:14:46.025 --> 00:14:46.952\nAll right.\n\n238\n00:14:46.952 --> 00:14:50.065\nYeah, I'm not getting through.\n\n239\n00:14:50.065 --> 00:14:54.087\n[LAUGH] Because, If you can imagine\nthe University of Florida and\n\n240\n00:14:54.087 --> 00:14:57.142\nthe College of Journalism and\nCommunications,\n\n241\n00:14:57.142 --> 00:15:01.832\nthey're locked down to where their Skype\nfor Business is not gonna let this\n\n242\n00:15:01.832 --> 00:15:06.975\nJustin Timberlake at Microsoft exits\nofficeprodemocode.onmicrosoft.com,\n\n243\n00:15:06.975 --> 00:15:11.027\nthey're probably seeing that\nbe like ,that look suspicious?\n\n244\n00:15:11.027 --> 00:15:13.137\nNope, we're blocking it.\n\n245\n00:15:13.137 --> 00:15:14.838\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And Tiffany has no control over that\n\n246\n00:15:14.838 --> 00:15:17.944\ncuz she said wait let me go ahead and\ntry and change some of My Settings.\n\n247\n00:15:17.944 --> 00:15:22.526\nMaybe I can allow external users cuz she\ngoes I know I've chatted with plenty\n\n248\n00:15:22.526 --> 00:15:25.116\nof people out of the university via Skype.\n\n249\n00:15:25.116 --> 00:15:30.126\nSo it's just this particular\naccount that I'm sending it\n\n250\n00:15:30.126 --> 00:15:36.481\nfrom because I went to my Vonne@itprotv\nand we could Skype, no problem.\n\n251\n00:15:36.481 --> 00:15:41.288\nSo it did block me, and\nthat could be how whatever network that\n\n252\n00:15:41.288 --> 00:15:45.179\nyou're trying to contact\nof how they're set up.\n\n253\n00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:48.262\nAnd those are things you can set\nup as an administrator, correct?\n\n254\n00:15:48.262 --> 00:15:52.777\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the idea where it says Company\nPolicy is kind of the key to let you know\n\n255\n00:15:52.777 --> 00:15:56.219\nthat they were able through\ntheir Office 365 settings\n\n256\n00:15:56.219 --> 00:15:58.799\nThey were able to set\nup a particular rule or\n\n257\n00:15:58.799 --> 00:16:03.080\na policy that says something\nexactly what Vonne was describing.\n\n258\n00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.780\nThat if you have\nan onmicrosoft.com type of domain\n\n259\n00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.940\ninside of Skype for Business,\nyou're not gonna be able to contact.\n\n260\n00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:16.760\nOr it could actually be tied to the way\nthat the account was actually addressed,\n\n261\n00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.280\nsomething like Justin Timberlake,\nsince he's a public figure.\n\n262\n00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.610\nThey probably might go we know that\nsomebody is trying to alias or fake or\n\n263\n00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:29.060\nspoof his particular account, so it just\ndepends on what policies are set up.\n\n264\n00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.600\nYou can set this for anything that\nyou want to, and those rules again\n\n265\n00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.200\nare probably beyond what most end\nusers are going to be able to change.\n\n266\n00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.836\nAnything in their settings is not gonna\nhelp them to override the company policy.\n\n267\n00:16:39.836 --> 00:16:40.595\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I even,\n\n268\n00:16:40.595 --> 00:16:43.178\ncuz we're on the phone together\nwhile we were testing this out.\n\n269\n00:16:43.178 --> 00:16:44.980\nAnd she said, well,\nlet me try it on my end and\n\n270\n00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.590\nsend it to your JT account, still blocked.\n\n271\n00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.170\nSo she got on the same one like nope,\nyou can't do this.\n\n272\n00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.890\nIt's not gonna work, so on and so forth.\n\n273\n00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:56.910\nSo but in mine, it says it's still\nsaving my conversation [LAUGH], so\n\n274\n00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.490\neverything is still\nbeing logged on my end.\n\n275\n00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:00.930\nBut she doesn't get any part of it.\n\n276\n00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:04.380\nSo if you ever encounter that\nparticular type of messaging, well,\n\n277\n00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:10.240\nnow you know it's just part of the game\nand how networks can be controlled.\n\n278\n00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.200\nI'm gonna close on that.\n\n279\n00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.770\nWell, what about hey, I'm gonna get rid\nof some of these messages, right, for\n\n280\n00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:18.118\nwhatever reason [LAUGH].\n\n281\n00:17:18.118 --> 00:17:22.665\nReally, I just need to clean house, cuz I\ndo so much testing before the shows, make\n\n282\n00:17:22.665 --> 00:17:27.360\nsure I've got everything planned out and\nready to go, and it's actually working.\n\n283\n00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.250\nSo I've got a lot of stuff in here.\n\n284\n00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.400\nI can come into my conversations,\nwhether it's missed or all,\n\n285\n00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.300\nit doesn't matter which tab I'm in.\n\n286\n00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.451\nAnd maybe I want to delete\nthis message from Joey.\n\n287\n00:17:39.451 --> 00:17:43.960\nI can right-click on this, and\nnotice there is delete the conversation.\n\n288\n00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.980\nSo I can take this out and delete it.\n\n289\n00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.540\nAnd it deleted.\n\n290\n00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.050\nThis one, I can delete it.\n\n291\n00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.570\nAnd you could go through and\ndelete all of them.\n\n292\n00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.990\nI don't think you can,\nI don't believe, you can, okay.\n\n293\n00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.995\nI know in Mac, the Mac Skype for Business,\n\n294\n00:18:00.995 --> 00:18:05.100\nI can't do a Shift+click and\nselect multiple messages.\n\n295\n00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.131\nAt least I can't seem to do it,\nI've tried many times.\n\n296\n00:18:08.131 --> 00:18:11.060\nI have to individually go through and\ndelete every one.\n\n297\n00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.524\nBut it looks like, I'm going to test this.\n\n298\n00:18:13.524 --> 00:18:17.400\nIf I Shift+click, meaning I\nsingle-clicked on one, hold my Shift key,\n\n299\n00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.626\nsingle click on another one,\nit selects all of them within that range.\n\n300\n00:18:21.626 --> 00:18:24.660\nI can right-click and\nI can delete the conversation,\n\n301\n00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.210\nand it looks like, yep,\nit takes a little bit.\n\n302\n00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.154\nMaybe, come on, you can do it.\n\n303\n00:18:30.154 --> 00:18:32.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Come on, Skype!\n\n304\n00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.320\nAll right, well, if I keep on talking\nhopefully it will go ahead and\n\n305\n00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.890\ndelete those groups of messages and\nthen everything goes.\n\n306\n00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.057\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n&gt;&gt; There we go, see, perfect.\n\n307\n00:18:39.057 --> 00:18:41.520\nAnd then it goes ahead and gets rid of it.\n\n308\n00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.127\nWell, and you didn't really delete them.\n\n309\n00:18:45.127 --> 00:18:50.270\n[LAUGH] Because it is tied to,\nnot just your Office 365 account,\n\n310\n00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:54.220\nit's also storing in your Outlook.\n\n311\n00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.715\nThe connection between Skype and\nOutlook is very strong, so\n\n312\n00:18:57.715 --> 00:19:00.189\nlet's go ahead and start up Outlook here.\n\n313\n00:19:00.189 --> 00:19:02.980\nYou could be using the desktop\nlocal installation or\n\n314\n00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.883\nyou could go to the online version,\n\n315\n00:19:04.883 --> 00:19:09.278\nto where you're logging in through your\nbrowser and checking your mail that way.\n\n316\n00:19:09.278 --> 00:19:12.500\nEither way you're still going\nto have the same options\n\n317\n00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.150\nof in my conversation history,\n\n318\n00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:22.190\nthis particular folder within\nOutlook is an automatic folder.\n\n319\n00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.540\nThey make this and\nguess what goes in there?\n\n320\n00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.750\n[SOUND] Sorry, I haven't brought up\nOutlook and I have dance practice.\n\n321\n00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.969\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; JC has some dance practice and\n\n322\n00:19:30.969 --> 00:19:32.287\na director's meeting in there.\n\n323\n00:19:32.287 --> 00:19:34.650\n[LAUGH] I'll go ahead and dismiss that.\n\n324\n00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:41.210\nMy conversation history is just that,\nthe history of all of your conversations.\n\n325\n00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.560\nYou can see there's\nthe conversation with Taylor.\n\n326\n00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.930\nThe conversation with the one I tried\nto show you with Tiffany Robert, and\n\n327\n00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.570\nI got the Renee conversation.\n\n328\n00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.400\nSo all of these are stored here.\n\n329\n00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:59.390\nThis is the archive folder for\nall of your Skype communications.\n\n330\n00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:00.810\nThese are the default settings.\n\n331\n00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:07.490\nIf I really want things to go away, you've\ngot to not just delete it from Skype for\n\n332\n00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.380\nBusiness, you have to delete it here.\n\n333\n00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.890\nIn my conversation history,\nI could go ahead and\n\n334\n00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.410\nselect all of them if I wanted to.\n\n335\n00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:18.927\nI'm just going to do Command+A, or sorry,\nCtrl+A, I'm in Windows right now, right?\n\n336\n00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:20.965\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I can do Ctrl+A and\n\n337\n00:20:20.965 --> 00:20:22.980\nthen I can go ahead and delete them.\n\n338\n00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:28.130\nBut we know from Outlook,\nwhere did it go, Ronnie?\n\n339\n00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:29.272\n&gt;&gt; It really didn't go anywhere.\n\n340\n00:20:29.272 --> 00:20:29.945\n&gt;&gt; No [LAUGH].\n\n341\n00:20:29.945 --> 00:20:33.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it actually has been\narchived at some point in time.\n\n342\n00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:37.637\nSo in there, you'll gonna find out\nsomething even if you delete it from your\n\n343\n00:20:37.637 --> 00:20:40.948\nown Outlook, which is your own\npersonal store on your machine.\n\n344\n00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:45.450\nIt does not necessarily mean that that's\nwhat gonna happen out on the cloud.\n\n345\n00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.560\nNow even if it disappears from the cloud,\nsomewhere in the background,\n\n346\n00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:55.190\nit is still being archived somewhere.\n\n347\n00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:56.170\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm glad you went there, and\n\n348\n00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.812\nit's still in your deleted items\nfolder in Outlook [LAUGH].\n\n349\n00:20:57.812 --> 00:20:58.760\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n350\n00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.870\n&gt;&gt; So in Outlook, but\nlike what you said with Outlook,\n\n351\n00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.360\nit doesn't matter if it's an email,\na conversation.\n\n352\n00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.590\nSo yeah, well, I'm gonna be like\nit went into my deleted items.\n\n353\n00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:12.030\nSo you think well, I just go ahead and\ntake the deleted items folder and\n\n354\n00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.468\nI'm gonna go ahead and empty the trash.\n\n355\n00:21:14.468 --> 00:21:20.100\nYou can right-click on here and you can\ngo to, there it is, empty folder, right?\n\n356\n00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.221\nAnd now it's permanently being deleted,\nright?\n\n357\n00:21:23.221 --> 00:21:29.370\nEverything in the deleted items folder,\nwhen you take out the trash, it goes away.\n\n358\n00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.783\nWell, like you just said [SOUND],\nyes and no [LAUGH].\n\n359\n00:21:32.783 --> 00:21:37.247\n&gt;&gt; And actually, Vonne, if you see that\nlittle blue with the eye right above\n\n360\n00:21:37.247 --> 00:21:39.795\nthe word all there, look at what it says.\n\n361\n00:21:39.795 --> 00:21:40.417\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n362\n00:21:40.417 --> 00:21:41.381\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n363\n00:21:41.381 --> 00:21:42.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So unless you know,\n\n364\n00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.200\nit's not really deleted, is it?\n\n365\n00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.920\nRight, so as you see that, it says what?\n\n366\n00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.696\nRead that cuz I can't really see it.\n\n367\n00:21:47.696 --> 00:21:50.690\n&gt;&gt; Recover items recently\nremoved from this folder.\n\n368\n00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's your deleted item,\nwhich said what?\n\n369\n00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.515\nIf you delete them-\n&gt;&gt; They're permanently deleted.\n\n370\n00:21:54.515 --> 00:21:57.010\n&gt;&gt; They're permanently deleted,\nso what does that mean?\n\n371\n00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.940\nIt means that this is technically\nwhat is called a soft delete.\n\n372\n00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.700\nAnd that soft delete means you're\nnot gonna be able to get them back,\n\n373\n00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:08.710\nyou aren't, unless you actually go\nthrough this particular step to do so.\n\n374\n00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:13.240\nIn the background though, it is being\narchived somewhere for a particular\n\n375\n00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.400\nperiod of time and that all depends on\nyour organization how long that's done.\n\n376\n00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.980\nI don't remember.\n\n377\n00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:23.630\nI think, if I remember correctly,\nthe default is something like four years.\n\n378\n00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:27.410\nIf your organization is keeping all that,\nbut that can be changed.\n\n379\n00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:31.010\nUsually if you change it, it's changed for\nlonger, not normally shorter.\n\n380\n00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:32.360\nBut you can do that.\n\n381\n00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:36.460\nIt just depends on how much room, how much\nstorage your company is willing to pay.\n\n382\n00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:40.280\n&gt;&gt; And we had a little conversation about\nthis before the episode started because\n\n383\n00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.220\nI wanted to make sure that\nI understood it properly.\n\n384\n00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:46.640\nBecause it is something like\nthe admin of the Office 365 account,\n\n385\n00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.310\nthey have to set up the hey,\nwe're gonna log everything.\n\n386\n00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:55.050\nAnd you said if they didn't,\nI guess then technically yeah,\n\n387\n00:22:55.050 --> 00:23:00.220\nif you delete all of this,\nyeah it will go away.\n\n388\n00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.240\nSo for legal purposes, I'm sure a lot\nof organizations don't do that.\n\n389\n00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.540\nThey set up, everything is logged.\n\n390\n00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:11.954\nEvery single thing you do on\nyour network through Office 365,\n\n391\n00:23:11.954 --> 00:23:13.891\nthey will be able to pull it.\n\n392\n00:23:13.891 --> 00:23:16.531\nAnd if you think about different\ngovernment organizations,\n\n393\n00:23:16.531 --> 00:23:19.180\nthe University of Florida,\nlike we were just talking about.\n\n394\n00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.994\nI'm sure that they might store it for\neven longer than four years, or\n\n395\n00:23:21.994 --> 00:23:24.275\nwhatever you said the default\nis because they've got,\n\n396\n00:23:24.275 --> 00:23:27.209\nI mean they're a government entity,\nthey're a public institution.\n\n397\n00:23:27.209 --> 00:23:32.350\nSo I mean, that's like a whole other legal\narea that everything, I don't care how\n\n398\n00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:37.720\nmuch you wanna think that you've deleted\neverything and you've scrubbed it all out.\n\n399\n00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.840\n&gt;&gt; It's not.\n&gt;&gt; It's there.\n\n400\n00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:44.116\n&gt;&gt; And it's weird, the technical\nway that Skype for Business or\n\n401\n00:23:44.116 --> 00:23:48.751\nactually even Office describes this\nis that you can create what's called\n\n402\n00:23:48.751 --> 00:23:53.030\na legal hold and that will actually\nput a user account in legal hold.\n\n403\n00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:56.562\nOr you can actually have this kind of\ndefault set up to archive everything for\n\n404\n00:23:56.562 --> 00:24:00.278\neverybody, In what they do and you might\nbe wondering, why is that important?\n\n405\n00:24:00.278 --> 00:24:03.600\nIt's because every conversation that\nyou have may have legal ramifications.\n\n406\n00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.150\nEvery email you send has same thing.\n\n407\n00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:09.040\nEvery document you store in\nOneDrive has the same thing.\n\n408\n00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.400\nAnd SharePoint, you name it,\nwe can even do a search and\n\n409\n00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.631\nsay where a lawyer comes in and gives us.\n\n410\n00:24:15.631 --> 00:24:20.050\nFor the last six years, we want every time\nwhere Von Smith mentioned the word cats.\n\n411\n00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:21.732\n&gt;&gt; That would be a lot [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it might yeah.\n\n412\n00:24:21.732 --> 00:24:26.304\nI mean we can literally go back in and\npull that up and show exactly every\n\n413\n00:24:26.304 --> 00:24:31.667\nlocation, every conversation that she\nused Skype for Business and every email.\n\n414\n00:24:31.667 --> 00:24:33.897\nEverything that ever\ncame through that system.\n\n415\n00:24:33.897 --> 00:24:35.248\nAnd do that if we wanted to.\n\n416\n00:24:35.248 --> 00:24:38.890\n&gt;&gt; And I thought that was an interesting\nthing that you had said of like what you.\n\n417\n00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:44.030\nYou can pull that out like specifically\nwhen she talks about cats and\n\n418\n00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.920\ncats with Christmas hats.\n\n419\n00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:51.390\nYou can get that fine into your\nsearch parameters and everything.\n\n420\n00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:56.230\nSo yes, I am showing you as an end user,\nhow you can delete it and clean house.\n\n421\n00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:59.898\nMostly for yourself and\norganizing yourself.\n\n422\n00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:02.990\nBut yeah, its not gone from the network.\n\n423\n00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:05.756\nSo lemme go ahead and show you back\nhere and Skype for Business sends.\n\n424\n00:25:05.756 --> 00:25:07.236\nI did go into my Outlook,\n\n425\n00:25:07.236 --> 00:25:11.300\nonce the conversation history\nmoved it into the deleted Items.\n\n426\n00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.966\nDeleted the deleted items folder.\n\n427\n00:25:12.966 --> 00:25:16.138\nAnd now you can see that my all tab,\n\n428\n00:25:16.138 --> 00:25:20.970\nthis is the only thing\nthat's in here In my.\n\n429\n00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:21.927\nSo I've cleaned that a lot.\n\n430\n00:25:21.927 --> 00:25:23.970\nYou saw how many things I had in there.\n\n431\n00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:25.620\nThere's a ton of them in there.\n\n432\n00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:30.110\nSo it did clean it up for\nme and that's great.\n\n433\n00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:33.632\nNow the setting of where\nall of my items and\n\n434\n00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:39.381\nconversations go into my conversation\nhistory folder in outlook.\n\n435\n00:25:39.381 --> 00:25:41.920\nYou actually can break that.\n\n436\n00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.760\nWell, you can if they allow you to right?\n\n437\n00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.246\nSo if I come into the options here.\n\n438\n00:25:47.246 --> 00:25:50.500\nAnd I go into,\nI believe it's personal, yes.\n\n439\n00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.570\nIn the personal section.\n\n440\n00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:53.990\nNotice down here,\n\n441\n00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:59.790\nit says save IM conversations\nin my email conversation folder.\n\n442\n00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.940\nAll right,\n\n443\n00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:07.190\nif I uncheck that, then it's not gonna\nbe the end of the conversation history.\n\n444\n00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:11.191\nAnd technically,\nif I delete the messages or\n\n445\n00:26:11.191 --> 00:26:16.575\nany conversations in my Skype for\nBusiness then it's gone.\n\n446\n00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:20.581\nLike I don't have to go and do that\nextra step of going into outlook and\n\n447\n00:26:20.581 --> 00:26:22.530\ndoing all that kind of fun stuff.\n\n448\n00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:26.792\nIt's not connected there, but\nagain it's still on like server and\n\n449\n00:26:26.792 --> 00:26:28.300\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n450\n00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:32.310\nSo if you didn't want that,\nyou could uncheck this.\n\n451\n00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:35.550\nAgain, maybe this is all grayed out for\nin your options,\n\n452\n00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:38.320\nbecause your organization is like,\nyou don't have any of that control.\n\n453\n00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.090\nSo, you could uncheck it.\n\n454\n00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:45.200\nSo, I believe that's everything I\nwanted to cover on just managing your\n\n455\n00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.400\nconversations.\n\n456\n00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.920\nIt's not just tied to IMs, it's all of it.\n\n457\n00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.060\nBut like I've said a couple times now,\nthat just to kinda reiterate that.\n\n458\n00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:56.300\nI just wanted to throw it in here because,\nthis is our first time,\n\n459\n00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:00.480\nin the sequence,\nthat we started communicating.\n\n460\n00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:06.410\nBut communication in all forms,\nnot just IMs, so with that, I am done.\n\n461\n00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:07.333\n&gt;&gt; Alright, Vawn.\n\n462\n00:27:07.333 --> 00:27:10.583\nOnce again, thank you for\nhelping understand that managing these\n\n463\n00:27:10.583 --> 00:27:13.137\nconversations can get\na little bit underwhelming,\n\n464\n00:27:13.137 --> 00:27:15.730\nespecially if you're doing a lot of them.\n\n465\n00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:18.840\nWhere now you take a look and\ninside your message history or\n\n466\n00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.550\nyour conversation history\nit's really long.\n\n467\n00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:23.078\nAnd you're wondering why it's actually so\nlong.\n\n468\n00:27:23.078 --> 00:27:26.550\nVaughn showed us how we could go in\nthere and clean those out as well.\n\n469\n00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:30.520\nHe explained a little about the technical\nbackground that's also behind this too.\n\n470\n00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.360\nAnd how we can clear that out,\nat least on our end for\n\n471\n00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.900\nwhat we're going to worry about.\n\n472\n00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:38.140\nWe're not so worried about of\ncourse the technical end of it.\n\n473\n00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.860\nEverybody's gonna set limits to the way\nthat they want it to be done for\n\n474\n00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:41.930\nthe organization.\n\n475\n00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:45.121\nYou just have to remember that\nwhatever you type in here,\n\n476\n00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:48.049\nmake sure you kind of\nunderstand this kind of thing.\n\n477\n00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:51.566\nWhich is somebody else is gonna be\ninvolved in that conversation, whether or\n\n478\n00:27:51.566 --> 00:27:53.010\nnot you want them to be.\n\n479\n00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:56.170\nAnd that means that a future date\nthey could pull it up if the need to.\n\n480\n00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:57.210\nBut Vaughn thank you.\n\n481\n00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:59.660\nLike we said for\nmaking sure we understand that.\n\n482\n00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.070\nAnd thank you also for watching as well.\n\n483\n00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:06.060\nSigning off for\nOfficePro TV I'm your host Ronnie Wong\n\n484\n00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.280\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vaughn

00:00:18.111\nyou're watching the Skype for\nBusiness show.\n\n4\n00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:19.719\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:23.365\nAnd today, we're going to be\ntaking a look at audio calls.\n\n6\n00:00:23.365 --> 00:00:27.589\nAnd making sure we understand how to get\nset up, and here to help us, of course,\n\n7\n00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.832\nis gonna be, well the first lady of\nOfficePro.TV herself, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:33.118\nVonne, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:33.118 --> 00:00:34.138\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for having me.\n\n10\n00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:35.545\n&gt;&gt; That's the queen's-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n11\n00:00:35.545 --> 00:00:36.592\n&gt;&gt; Turning the light vault.\n\n12\n00:00:36.592 --> 00:00:37.867\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, elbow-\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n13\n00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:38.999\n&gt;&gt; Elbow, wrist, wrist.\n\n14\n00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:39.739\n&gt;&gt; I did not know that.\n\n15\n00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.943\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Vonne here it is,\n\n16\n00:00:41.943 --> 00:00:46.472\nwe've really been talking a little bit\nabout, of course, using instant messaging.\n\n17\n00:00:46.472 --> 00:00:50.992\nWe see Skype for\nBusiness as a great tool that we can use.\n\n18\n00:00:50.992 --> 00:00:54.766\nAnd now it's time to essentially do,\nwell audio calls and\n\n19\n00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.700\nunderstanding the idea\nof audio calls here.\n\n20\n00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.220\nVonne, it sounds pretty simple, but the\nmore that you and I kind of dive into this\n\n21\n00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.364\narea, we found it a little bit more\ncomplex than we thought, didn't we?\n\n22\n00:01:06.364 --> 00:01:10.037\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's one of those that it's\nso simple, it can be really confusing.\n\n23\n00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:11.221\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n24\n00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:13.898\n&gt;&gt; And it even tripped me up too as to why\n\n25\n00:01:13.898 --> 00:01:19.258\nis this showing like Skype calls,\nbut this one's showing voicemail,\n\n26\n00:01:19.258 --> 00:01:22.314\nbut this one's not showing voicemail.\n\n27\n00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:28.125\nI'm talking like when I'm looking at my\ncontacts, and so I can see where it can\n\n28\n00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:34.131\nbe kind of confusing as to what exactly is\nan audio call and how is that different?\n\n29\n00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:38.246\nWell, I guess they're all audio calls in\nthe sense that you have a Skype call and\n\n30\n00:01:38.246 --> 00:01:40.180\nthen you have a phone call.\n\n31\n00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.305\nAnd there are two different ways that\nyou can communicate through audio.\n\n32\n00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:47.231\nLike where we're actually,\n\n33\n00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:49.157\njust like a telephone where you're\ngonna pick up the phone and\n\n34\n00:01:49.157 --> 00:01:50.058\nactually talk to somebody.\n\n35\n00:01:50.058 --> 00:01:54.134\nInstead of just chatting, where we're\njust iming and we're just typing away and\n\n36\n00:01:54.134 --> 00:01:56.213\nsending emoticons and things like that.\n\n37\n00:01:56.213 --> 00:02:01.054\nSo now if we're getting into hey,\nI need to just actually hear your voice.\n\n38\n00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:04.056\nAnd so what are the different\nways that it can come through?\n\n39\n00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:08.146\nSo this particular episode,\nwe're just gonna break it down,\n\n40\n00:02:08.146 --> 00:02:12.480\nwe're going to just explain it,\nit's more of a concept episode.\n\n41\n00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.001\nNot necessarily demonstrating how\nto place a Skype for Business,\n\n42\n00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:19.188\nor Skype call, or a phone call.\n\n43\n00:02:19.188 --> 00:02:22.001\nWe'll do those in the next episodes, so\n\n44\n00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:26.401\nI always like to kind of get you all,\nknowing what's going on.\n\n45\n00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:28.052\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Kinda look under the hood,\n\n46\n00:02:28.052 --> 00:02:30.992\nwe're actually gonna take\na look at some admin settings,\n\n47\n00:02:30.992 --> 00:02:32.432\neven if you can't get to it.\n\n48\n00:02:32.432 --> 00:02:36.918\nI know me, I wanna know how it all works.\n\n49\n00:02:36.918 --> 00:02:39.256\nIt doesn't mean I need to go ahead and\nchange anything about it.\n\n50\n00:02:39.256 --> 00:02:43.046\nI'll let the network admins go ahead and\ncontrol all that stuff, but\n\n51\n00:02:43.046 --> 00:02:46.063\njust having a basic understanding\nof how it all works.\n\n52\n00:02:46.063 --> 00:02:51.086\nI think helps me be able as an end user\nto use the products more efficiently,\n\n53\n00:02:51.086 --> 00:02:53.497\nand just have a general knowledge.\n\n54\n00:02:53.497 --> 00:02:55.324\nAnd I guess that's really why we all here,\naren't we, Ronnie?\n\n55\n00:02:55.324 --> 00:02:57.213\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's true Vonne, so\n\n56\n00:02:57.213 --> 00:02:59.086\nhow are going to get started here Vonne?\n\n57\n00:02:59.086 --> 00:03:01.863\nWhen we start talking about\nthe idea this audio calls?\n\n58\n00:03:01.863 --> 00:03:06.473\n&gt;&gt; Well I made a little PowerPoint\npresentation, cuz as instructors or\n\n59\n00:03:06.473 --> 00:03:09.738\neducators, whatever we\nwanna deem ourselves.\n\n60\n00:03:09.738 --> 00:03:11.201\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We always seem to go to\n\n61\n00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:12.002\nthe board, right?\n\n62\n00:03:12.002 --> 00:03:15.132\nLet me draw this for you, so\nI can go ahead and better illustrate it.\n\n63\n00:03:15.132 --> 00:03:19.848\nSo I got one started, I'm not running the\nshow, I'm just using it within PowerPoint.\n\n64\n00:03:19.848 --> 00:03:25.845\nSo we've got right here, understanding\nSkype call versus a phone call.\n\n65\n00:03:25.845 --> 00:03:31.017\nSo there are two ways, and I've kinda\nalready said this, that we can use audio.\n\n66\n00:03:31.017 --> 00:03:37.555\nWe can either call somebody through Skype,\nor we can call somebody through the phone.\n\n67\n00:03:37.555 --> 00:03:41.942\nBut it really depends on what level\nof subscription you have, and\n\n68\n00:03:41.942 --> 00:03:44.352\nreally like the account settings.\n\n69\n00:03:44.352 --> 00:03:47.981\nDo you have all the pieces necessary for\nyou to make a phone call?\n\n70\n00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:51.319\nBut that's okay,\nif you don't because you can use Skype for\n\n71\n00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.686\nBusiness to communicate with each other.\n\n72\n00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:57.814\nYou're basically kind of\ncalling through Skype for\n\n73\n00:03:57.814 --> 00:04:00.638\nBusiness as oppose to a phone line.\n\n74\n00:04:00.638 --> 00:04:04.145\nSo you have Skype for Business,\nyour colleague has Skype for\n\n75\n00:04:04.145 --> 00:04:07.736\nBusiness, you guys can communicate\nthat way through audio.\n\n76\n00:04:07.736 --> 00:04:09.758\nNow of course,\nthis also adds video to you,\n\n77\n00:04:09.758 --> 00:04:11.680\nyou can always add video component to it.\n\n78\n00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.522\nBut sometimes you don't need\nto see each other's faces,\n\n79\n00:04:14.522 --> 00:04:16.610\nyou just need to hear each other's voice.\n\n80\n00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.042\nSo we can do that directly\nthrough Skype for Business.\n\n81\n00:04:20.042 --> 00:04:24.750\nNow you can also use Skype for\nBusiness set up as\n\n82\n00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.579\nan actual phone,\nlike you have a phone number,\n\n83\n00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:35.639\nthat people can call you at,\nand Skype is how you answer it.\n\n84\n00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.817\nSo you can say all right, well I'll pick\nit all up and we'll talk on the phone.\n\n85\n00:04:39.817 --> 00:04:44.076\nWhether you have a physical\nphone set at your desk,\n\n86\n00:04:44.076 --> 00:04:47.057\ncuz we have that here at ITPro.TV.\n\n87\n00:04:47.057 --> 00:04:51.068\nRenee who will probably be chatting with,\nshe has a phone,\n\n88\n00:04:51.068 --> 00:04:55.241\nan actual phone set that is\nconnected to her phone number, but\n\n89\n00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:58.709\nis all administrated through Skype for\nBusiness.\n\n90\n00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:04.610\nWe don't goto any telephone provider,\nit's all through Skype, but that means\n\n91\n00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.011\nthat our members or our different\nusers I should say, within ITPro.TV.\n\n92\n00:05:10.011 --> 00:05:14.750\nEach account has to be set up with\nsomething that is a phone system and\n\n93\n00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.340\nit would have to have a calling plan.\n\n94\n00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.756\nSo it's just like if you're gonna\nwalk into Verizon, AT&amp;T, Sprint,\n\n95\n00:05:20.756 --> 00:05:22.165\nwhatever store you wanna go.\n\n96\n00:05:22.165 --> 00:05:26.441\nYou say hey, I need to go ahead and\nbuy a phone like a physical phone,\n\n97\n00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:30.268\nthen that carrier would provide\nyou with a phone number, and\n\n98\n00:05:30.268 --> 00:05:33.363\nthen you would have to sign up for\na calling plan.\n\n99\n00:05:33.363 --> 00:05:35.733\nAre you calling international,\nare you calling domestic?\n\n100\n00:05:35.733 --> 00:05:39.997\nSo the same way that you think of setting\nup a phone, it's the same way in Skype for\n\n101\n00:05:39.997 --> 00:05:40.639\nBusiness.\n\n102\n00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.294\nIt's cool though that Microsoft has all\nof these different services which we\n\n103\n00:05:45.294 --> 00:05:46.518\ncall them, right?\n\n104\n00:05:46.518 --> 00:05:51.467\nAnd plans that you just go ahead and set\nit all up there, right inspect for visits,\n\n105\n00:05:51.467 --> 00:05:52.344\npretty cool.\n\n106\n00:05:52.344 --> 00:05:53.999\nSo what do I have?\n\n107\n00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:57.427\nLike if you're saying,\nI don't know if I have a phone system and\n\n108\n00:05:57.427 --> 00:05:58.897\ncan I call out using Skype.\n\n109\n00:05:58.897 --> 00:06:03.171\nWell the biggest way that you can\ntell Is look at your interface.\n\n110\n00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:07.280\nIf you don't have a phone,\nthen you're not gonna see a dial pad.\n\n111\n00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.244\nSo you can see over here\non Justin Timberlake,\n\n112\n00:06:10.244 --> 00:06:14.584\nJustin only has the context,\nthe conversations and the meetings.\n\n113\n00:06:14.584 --> 00:06:19.419\nBut Joey, Joey has a phone,\nhe has a phone system and a calling plan.\n\n114\n00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:24.412\nSo you see that Joey has a dial pad, like\na whole other button up on that top of\n\n115\n00:06:24.412 --> 00:06:28.949\nyour main navigation,\nwe'll say within that Skype for Business.\n\n116\n00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:33.278\nAnd you can also see down at the bottom,\nhe's got like a little phone thing that\n\n117\n00:06:33.278 --> 00:06:36.507\nsays something about call forwarding,\nJustin does not.\n\n118\n00:06:36.507 --> 00:06:41.668\nAnd now, this is another example\nof Justin and Joey are both on\n\n119\n00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:47.335\nthe OfficePro Demo Co Network,\nthey're all part of that company.\n\n120\n00:06:47.335 --> 00:06:51.208\nAnd so you can see that one person\nin an organization, network,\n\n121\n00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:56.106\ncompany, whatever you wanna call it,\nhas a phone, and the other one doesn't.\n\n122\n00:06:56.106 --> 00:06:59.168\nJust like here at ITPro.TV, as edutainers,\n\n123\n00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:02.471\nwe don't have a phone system,\nwe don't need it.\n\n124\n00:07:02.471 --> 00:07:06.731\nWe don't call anybody that way,\nbut we do have Skype for Business,\n\n125\n00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:08.545\nso that's on our accounts.\n\n126\n00:07:08.545 --> 00:07:12.947\nBut Renee, who's going to be doing a lot\nof phone calling, she has a phone system.\n\n127\n00:07:12.947 --> 00:07:17.540\nSo you can pick and choose what\nusers within your organization have\n\n128\n00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.310\nthese particular systems and\nplans associated with their account.\n\n129\n00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.819\nCuz everyone's account\nis their own account,\n\n130\n00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:29.680\ndoesn't matter who's managing\nit within a small or\n\n131\n00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.431\nlarge organization, so\nthat's how you can tell what you have.\n\n132\n00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:39.494\nSo the other thing that you have to be\naware of when you're using Skype for\n\n133\n00:07:39.494 --> 00:07:43.404\nBusiness is it's not just\nwhat you are set up as, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:43.404 --> 00:07:47.688\nI don't have as Justin, I don't have\na phone, so I'm not gonna be dialing\n\n135\n00:07:47.688 --> 00:07:51.850\npeople's numbers, but I can contact\nthem through Skype for Business.\n\n136\n00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.114\nWhat your contact has set up depends\non what you're going to see and\n\n137\n00:07:57.114 --> 00:08:01.643\nwhat you're able to do with\ncommunicating with that particular user.\n\n138\n00:08:01.643 --> 00:08:02.544\nBased on their settings.\n\n139\n00:08:02.544 --> 00:08:08.662\nYou can see right here on the left\nthat Vonne Smith through Justin,\n\n140\n00:08:08.662 --> 00:08:11.400\nI don't have a phone system.\n\n141\n00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.090\nSo all I see on the call and\nhere I can zoom in on this,\n\n142\n00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.530\nI know these are a little small.\n\n143\n00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:21.050\nSo all I'll see is call and it says Skype\ncall but you have Justin Timberlake.\n\n144\n00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:28.100\nSo same user but this contact,\nJoey Fatone, Joey has a phone.\n\n145\n00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:34.120\nSo I will see another option in the call\nfor voicemail because, just like\n\n146\n00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:39.030\nthe telephone, you can setup voicemail for\npeople to leave messages and everything.\n\n147\n00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.960\nSo that's why you'll see\ndifferent options for\n\n148\n00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.420\nyour contacts in how you can call them.\n\n149\n00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.790\nLet me zoom out there a little bit.\n\n150\n00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.570\nSo, let's go on to the next slide.\n\n151\n00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:56.580\nSo, what if me as the user,\nI have a phone system.\n\n152\n00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.900\nWhat about, again, the other side?\n\n153\n00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:03.140\nMy contact that I'm calling, or\ntrying to contact, I should just say.\n\n154\n00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.240\nLet's just go ahead and communicate.\n\n155\n00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.670\nNotice on the left, this is Joey's\naccount, so Joey has a phone.\n\n156\n00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.560\nWhen he is going to try to\ncommunicate with Vaughn,\n\n157\n00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.485\nit's weird talking about myself,\nI'm the third person.\n\n158\n00:09:13.485 --> 00:09:15.780\n[LAUGH] He calls Vaughn.\n\n159\n00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.340\nHe only gets the option for a Skype call.\n\n160\n00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.420\nThis new number that's gonna pop up,\nthis is always gonna be there,\n\n161\n00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.990\nbecause you can, as Joey,\nyou can dial out.\n\n162\n00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:31.420\nLike if I had, and this is also,\nI mean jump around really quick.\n\n163\n00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.260\nLook over hear on the right hand side,\nbased on contact information.\n\n164\n00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.670\nSo what you have as your contact card for\nthat particular contact,\n\n165\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:47.540\nmight show up a phone number cuz Vaughn\nhas a cellphone and a business phone,\n\n166\n00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:53.690\nand if that is part of that contact card\nwithin Joey's account, then he could use\n\n167\n00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:59.290\nhis phone system and his phone\nthrough Skype Business to call Vaughn.\n\n168\n00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:03.366\nBut that's going to be on my actual phone,\nnot through Skype for Business.\n\n169\n00:10:03.366 --> 00:10:08.110\nAgain, kinda circular,\n[LAUGH] cuz we're talking about\n\n170\n00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.170\nit with different settings on\none side versus the other.\n\n171\n00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:16.110\nSo, let's come over and look at Lance\nas a contact within Joy's account.\n\n172\n00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:22.230\nLance does have a phone number and\nLance is part of the organization so\n\n173\n00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.060\nyou're probably going to see\nlike other numbers right there.\n\n174\n00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.305\nSo it notice, and by the way that's\n5551234 it's not his actual number.\n\n175\n00:10:29.305 --> 00:10:31.389\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's just what I made up,\n\n176\n00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:36.150\nbut you could see you might have multiple\nnumbers listed in there based on\n\n177\n00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:40.090\nthat contact card or\nmay be he has a phone and\n\n178\n00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.490\nhe has a phone system, but\nyou're not seeing any phone number.\n\n179\n00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:49.780\nI know within Skype for Business, Renee,\nI know she has a phone number but\n\n180\n00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:56.910\nit didn't come through on her contact\nwhen I added her to Justin's account.\n\n181\n00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:01.820\nSo, I would have to edit that\nperson's Contact card to make sure I\n\n182\n00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:06.360\nhave the right phone number associated\nwith it to be able to go ahead and\n\n183\n00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.230\ncall her using my Skype for\nBusiness call plan.\n\n184\n00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.640\nSo, just in case you're like,\nwell it's not there.\n\n185\n00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.340\nIt's not by default.\n\n186\n00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.650\nIt's all based on the information\nthat they provide for\n\n187\n00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:23.990\nyou in their contact information and\nwhether you have to add that information\n\n188\n00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.100\nby editing your contents by adding them to\nyour Outlook then go ahead and do that.\n\n189\n00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:33.740\nWe have in the episode, where we talk\nabout, I think it's add contents [LAUGH].\n\n190\n00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.270\nAll right, let's move on.\n\n191\n00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.872\nLet me zoom out too, first of all.\n\n192\n00:11:36.872 --> 00:11:37.730\n[LAUGH].\n\n193\n00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:44.150\nSo I see, all right, if you do have\na phone plan you will see a dial pad.\n\n194\n00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.910\nJust like on a regular phone.\n\n195\n00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:51.955\nYou will also see some options in here\nto be able to change your greeting and\n\n196\n00:11:51.955 --> 00:11:52.925\nset up your voicemail.\n\n197\n00:11:52.925 --> 00:11:56.805\nSo that will either go to\nthe options within Skype or\n\n198\n00:11:56.805 --> 00:12:00.005\nit might actually take you I\nthink the setup voicemail.\n\n199\n00:12:00.005 --> 00:12:04.385\nI think that actually goes out to\nyour account in your browser and\n\n200\n00:12:04.385 --> 00:12:08.800\nin your actual Office 365 and\nits settings within there.\n\n201\n00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.910\nSo you're just kinda navigating to\nit from this particular option and\n\n202\n00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.060\nit does give your voice messages.\n\n203\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.492\nSo if you have voicemail from somebody,\nyou can go ahead and access it right from\n\n204\n00:12:20.492 --> 00:12:24.925\nthis interface now it will pull up your\noutlook, and then, cuz everything that\n\n205\n00:12:24.925 --> 00:12:29.179\ncomes through as your voicemail,\nactually comes through as your e-mail.\n\n206\n00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:33.958\nIt's pretty cool, and if you're like,\nman, I really want this whole\n\n207\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:39.046\nphone systems once you see all these\nepisodes, well, I'll show you where you\n\n208\n00:12:39.046 --> 00:12:43.978\ncan get them because, like I said all of\nthis is based on your subscription or\n\n209\n00:12:43.978 --> 00:12:49.620\nwhether or not you want to add on a phone\nsystem and a calling plan to your account.\n\n210\n00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.220\nSo these are just two slides I have\nthe website that we just gonna ahead and\n\n211\n00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.230\npop up on into.\n\n212\n00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.937\nI have already pulled up.\n\n213\n00:12:55.937 --> 00:13:00.768\nSo we've gone over this in quite\na few different episodes within\n\n214\n00:13:00.768 --> 00:13:04.525\nthe Office 365 course,\nmaybe Word and Excel so\n\n215\n00:13:04.525 --> 00:13:09.727\nif you're seeing this again,\nyeah we do talk about this a lot [LAUGH].\n\n216\n00:13:09.727 --> 00:13:13.314\nSo you can see just kind of glancing\nat the home, so look this is for\n\n217\n00:13:13.314 --> 00:13:17.425\nhome noticed right away that they\ndon't even include Skype for business,\n\n218\n00:13:17.425 --> 00:13:19.770\nit's just has regular Skype.\n\n219\n00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:23.500\nSo if you're going to,\nif you have a home subscription,\n\n220\n00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.700\nyou're not gonna be able to really\nadd on these other features,\n\n221\n00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.910\nyou're gonna have to upgrade,\nyou're gonna have to go a bigger account.\n\n222\n00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.280\nSo if you come over here to\nsome of the business accounts,\n\n223\n00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.800\nnotice if you scroll on down.\n\n224\n00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:43.220\nOkay, so this one right here,\nwhat is this, the Office 365 Business.\n\n225\n00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.120\nWell, they don't even include Skype for\nBusiness.\n\n226\n00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.400\nSo you'd have to come over into these\nother accounts or other levels of\n\n227\n00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:56.480\nsubscriptions to be able to one, just get\nSkype for Business as part of your plan.\n\n228\n00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.530\nAnd the other one, and\nI think if you go under the more details,\n\n229\n00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.330\nyou do have to be a little\ncareful about whether or\n\n230\n00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.260\nnot they're just giving you\nthe client versus the service.\n\n231\n00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.126\nIs that correct, Ronnie?\n\n232\n00:14:07.126 --> 00:14:12.388\nLike some of them it's only the product,\nnot the whole system.\n\n233\n00:14:12.388 --> 00:14:16.074\n&gt;&gt; Right and that's because it's tied\ninto whether or not if you're just\n\n234\n00:14:16.074 --> 00:14:19.822\nusing the regular Skype calls,\nlike what we were talking about in that,\n\n235\n00:14:19.822 --> 00:14:23.509\nyou really don't have to worry about\nthat that comes with that Skype for\n\n236\n00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:25.684\nBusiness plan that includes that basic.\n\n237\n00:14:25.684 --> 00:14:28.261\nBut if you need to be able to\nhave your own phone number,\n\n238\n00:14:28.261 --> 00:14:31.904\nyou need to build set up voicemail,\nyou need to have that particular system,\n\n239\n00:14:31.904 --> 00:14:35.828\nthen that's gonna include an extra charge\nwhich is gonna be where you're gonna add\n\n240\n00:14:35.828 --> 00:14:37.290\ninto your subscription.\n\n241\n00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:41.730\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and that's where we can go up\none more level from a business into those\n\n242\n00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.700\nenterprise licensings and\nthat's what we have.\n\n243\n00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:49.540\nWe have enterprise systems,\nand it's the E3s and E5s.\n\n244\n00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.760\nThere's an E1 too right?\n\n245\n00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.460\nBut the pro plus that was\nthe one where I know,\n\n246\n00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.280\nI think Justin was just\na Pro Plus to begin with, but\n\n247\n00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:03.970\nwe had to upgrade him to like an E3,\nbecause we needed certain pieces.\n\n248\n00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.620\n&gt;&gt; Features.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I needed certain things to be\n\n249\n00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.360\nable to demonstrate to y'all\nwith Justin's account.\n\n250\n00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.187\nSo we just bumped it up and\nas you can see, it's just more money.\n\n251\n00:15:12.187 --> 00:15:15.620\n[LAUGH] Just like with anything,\nI just want the better plan.\n\n252\n00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.250\nSo some of these things.\n\n253\n00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:17.760\nI think the E5.\n\n254\n00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.690\nIt's like all of this is included.\n\n255\n00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:25.010\nThe phone systems and\nthe calling plans on this particular plan.\n\n256\n00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:29.470\n&gt;&gt; With E5, it's still actually requires\nyou to get another additional plan\n\n257\n00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.940\nif you have to dial\ninternationally as well.\n\n258\n00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.620\nSo there's a domestic calling plan and\nthere's an international plan too.\n\n259\n00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:41.230\nSo it will cost you extra money,\neven with an E5, to add that in for\n\n260\n00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:42.185\nyour organization.\n\n261\n00:15:42.185 --> 00:15:44.360\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, okay, and then so\n\n262\n00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.330\nthis is where I just have some links to\nmore information about the phone system.\n\n263\n00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:53.420\nIt's just like any provider, it's going\nto give you your phone numbers but\n\n264\n00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:54.920\nyou can't have one without the other.\n\n265\n00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.820\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You have to have a phone system and\n\n266\n00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.070\nyou have to have a calling plan.\n\n267\n00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.516\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; They have to go together in order for\n\n268\n00:16:00.516 --> 00:16:01.581\nyou to do this.\n\n269\n00:16:01.581 --> 00:16:04.940\nSo you can see Yeah, right there.\n\n270\n00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.401\nAdd a calling plan to\nyour E5 subscription,\n\n271\n00:16:06.401 --> 00:16:07.520\njust what you were talking about.\n\n272\n00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.594\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n273\n00:16:08.594 --> 00:16:10.050\nthere are more information there.\n\n274\n00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:14.590\nAnd these are just some more of\nthe support white pages as I call them.\n\n275\n00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.580\nThat you've seen me pull\nthese up a lot of times, so\n\n276\n00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.570\nit just kinda gives you\na little bit more information.\n\n277\n00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:23.880\nAnd It's not that you have to\nbuy just the subscription,\n\n278\n00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.120\nyou can buy a certain\nlevels of subscription and\n\n279\n00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:31.060\nthen kinda add on, like a la carte,\nthose different phone systems.\n\n280\n00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:35.620\nAnd there's a whole bunch of other things\nyou can add on within your Office 365\n\n281\n00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.090\naccount to just kind of,\njust more features, just more things.\n\n282\n00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:47.780\nSo I really like these to Help articles\ncause it kind of helped me understand it.\n\n283\n00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.927\nAnd so offering it for\nyou guys to go ahead and\n\n284\n00:16:49.927 --> 00:16:52.310\nkind of look at all the different things.\n\n285\n00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:56.763\nAnd just to look under the hood, I wanted\nto bring you into Justin Timberlake's\n\n286\n00:16:56.763 --> 00:17:00.630\naccount, cuz he is a global\nadministrator on this account, right?\n\n287\n00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.130\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n288\n00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:03.847\n&gt;&gt; This is where I'm getting into\nthe administration stuff, so\n\n289\n00:17:03.847 --> 00:17:06.405\nI'm glad I have Ronnie here with\nme [LAUGH] to help guide me,\n\n290\n00:17:06.405 --> 00:17:08.845\nsince you know this pretty well there,\nRonnie.\n\n291\n00:17:08.845 --> 00:17:10.315\n&gt;&gt; I've seen that a time or two.\n\n292\n00:17:10.315 --> 00:17:11.325\n&gt;&gt; Just a few times, right?\n\n293\n00:17:11.325 --> 00:17:12.565\n&gt;&gt; Just a few times.\n\n294\n00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:14.834\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you can come\ninto your account settings and\n\n295\n00:17:14.834 --> 00:17:16.005\nyou can go into the admin.\n\n296\n00:17:17.055 --> 00:17:19.375\nIf you don't see that, of course,\nyou don't have access to it.\n\n297\n00:17:19.375 --> 00:17:23.775\nSo I might be bringing you into places\nwhere you can't go because your network\n\n298\n00:17:23.775 --> 00:17:27.485\nhas decided to just, well,\nnot let you see these things.\n\n299\n00:17:27.485 --> 00:17:31.210\nThen over here on the other tab,\nthis is the admin center.\n\n300\n00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.960\nAnd so if we went into, is it billing?\n\n301\n00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.690\n&gt;&gt; Right, and then licenses.\n\n302\n00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.010\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there we go.\n\n303\n00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.500\nMaking sure Ronnie's directing\nme in the right way to go.\n\n304\n00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:45.215\nSo you can see that we have certain\npeople like we said, Justin Versus Joey,\n\n305\n00:17:45.215 --> 00:17:49.235\nand how many calling plans do we have,\nhow many E3 and\n\n306\n00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:54.395\nE5 licenses we have, and how they\nare used, and who they are assigned to.\n\n307\n00:17:54.395 --> 00:17:59.765\nSo you noticed that we don't have\nmore plans that we're using.\n\n308\n00:17:59.765 --> 00:18:03.075\nWe just buy them as we need\nthem just like started,\n\n309\n00:18:03.075 --> 00:18:07.174\nwe actually had a whole new group\nof people joining us in ITProTV.\n\n310\n00:18:07.174 --> 00:18:12.190\nAnd so Nate, who sets up all of our stuff,\nhe went and purchased more stuff.\n\n311\n00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.990\nAnd more plans for more users to go\nahead and just add on as we need.\n\n312\n00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:19.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the benefit behind\nthat is relatively simple.\n\n313\n00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.720\nYou don't have to buy 50\nphone lines at one time.\n\n314\n00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:28.000\nYou can purchase one as you need to,\nand that's what will end up happening.\n\n315\n00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.340\nSo getting them all set up in macro is\na little bit beyond what we'll be doing.\n\n316\n00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.630\nBut at least you understand that for your\norganization, your company, if you ended\n\n317\n00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:40.610\nup needing to use a voice call with\nthe actual phone number, they would\n\n318\n00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:45.580\npurchase for you like the domestic calling\nplan and allow you to be able to do that.\n\n319\n00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:50.470\nBut if you just have the E5 itself,\nyou can get setup with that communication\n\n320\n00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:54.180\ncredit that'll allow you to also set up\nlike a conference line if you wanted to.\n\n321\n00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.080\nBut for us, it allows the company\nto save money if only two\n\n322\n00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.020\npeople need of calling plan then\nall fifty don't have to buy one.\n\n323\n00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.450\n&gt;&gt; You know, you did actually just brought\nup a good plan about the conference\n\n324\n00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:08.030\ncalling and the audio bridges and-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n325\n00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:12.280\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I asked Nate to kind of walk\nme through our ITProTV settings and\n\n326\n00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.720\nhe's said, yeah, this is the bridge, and\n\n327\n00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.920\nthis is how we have multiple\ncalls that can come in.\n\n328\n00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.770\nKind of like a help line that we have for\nour member services.\n\n329\n00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:20.800\nHe's like there's this one.\n\n330\n00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.700\nAnd it was pretty neat to see\nall of it and how customizable.\n\n331\n00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:29.950\nIt's all right there that you control\nas an admin within your settings.\n\n332\n00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:33.770\nAnd It was really neat, so\nif you have a conference line, or\n\n333\n00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:38.950\nlike, just go ahead and give them this,\nthat is part of this whole deal.\n\n334\n00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.510\nSo if you don't have one, that's fine,\nbut just to let you know.\n\n335\n00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.150\nAnd I believe, we're not going to go\nthere, but you go into subscriptions and\n\n336\n00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.950\nI think that's where you\npurchase the other levels.\n\n337\n00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:52.230\nAnd then just one more thing\nthat I wanted to point out.\n\n338\n00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:53.340\nI think it's down here in the.\n\n339\n00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.830\n&gt;&gt; Advance centers.\n\n340\n00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.950\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there we go and\nthen noticing the Skype for Business,\n\n341\n00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:02.530\nthis is where you could go into\neach particular servers or\n\n342\n00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:07.400\nproduct and setup different parameters for\nyour organization,\n\n343\n00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:12.630\nso you could see we have our\nusers within Office Pro demo co.\n\n344\n00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:17.210\nWe have who has voice, who doesn't,\nour different phone numbers that we have\n\n345\n00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.440\nassociated with different accounts,\nall of these different things.\n\n346\n00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.010\nI know there was something about\nemergency locations that Nate says that\n\n347\n00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:28.130\nbefore he can even set up phone numbers,\n\n348\n00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:32.541\nyou have to have emergency number\nattached with like a physical location.\n\n349\n00:20:32.541 --> 00:20:37.100\n&gt;&gt; Physical location so this is all\nbased on where your 911 calls go,\n\n350\n00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:41.590\nthat's the reason why is every phone\nhere at least in the United States and\n\n351\n00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:45.010\nprobably around the world is based on\nwhatever your emergency number is.\n\n352\n00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:51.000\nSo here we do 911 over I think in\nthe UK is 999 or something like that.\n\n353\n00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.650\nBut just kind of realize that is\ngonna require a physical location\n\n354\n00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:58.130\nbecause that's where your phone\nactually is gonna originate.\n\n355\n00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:02.690\nSo this kind of also ends up\nbeing problematic at times too,\n\n356\n00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.710\nif you are using Skype for\nBusiness on your cellphone, so\n\n357\n00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.100\nthey actually even have an application for\nSkype for Business.\n\n358\n00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:12.120\nWell, that number can be transfer\nthere too and now Vonne's\n\n359\n00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.610\non a business trip up to New York City and\nshe uses her Skype for Business phone.\n\n360\n00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.890\nWell, if she hits that for\nsome reason on 911,\n\n361\n00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:25.950\nIt's gonna call the closest 911 center\nwhere that emergency location is.\n\n362\n00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:31.630\nSo that's why you tend to not want\nto do that on a mobile instance.\n\n363\n00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.580\n&gt;&gt; So, if I'm in New York,\nthey would find-\n\n364\n00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:34.630\n&gt;&gt; If you were using Skype for\n\n365\n00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:35.450\nBusiness client-\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n366\n00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:36.850\n&gt;&gt; That emergency location.\n\n367\n00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:38.020\nYeah, if you did that,\n\n368\n00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.890\nthat's where it's gonna say let\nme ring the 911 system there.\n\n369\n00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.010\n&gt;&gt; Wow, so it's not going to ring the 911.\n\n370\n00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.460\n&gt;&gt; In New York.\n&gt;&gt; And games, well, based on my account.\n\n371\n00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n372\n00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.280\n&gt;&gt; It is gonna bring in Gamesville.\n\n373\n00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.600\n&gt;&gt; Right.

Yeah, it's one of those, like you said,\nyou can just go ahead and dial, but\n\n23\n00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.630\nthen, how do we put the person on hold?\n\n24\n00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.700\nIt's kind of like, I know that\nwhen I worked at the university,\n\n25\n00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.260\nthose phones, I'm like how do\nI transfer this to somebody?\n\n26\n00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.210\nWhere's the mute button?\n\n27\n00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.550\nAnd I would hang up on the person.\n\n28\n00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.741\nI would do all these crazy things and\nit's like, it's just a phone,\n\n29\n00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:32.820\nit shouldn't be that complicated.\n\n30\n00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.260\nSo we're gonna take time to\ngo through the call window,\n\n31\n00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.450\nlike I'm going to place a call to Joey,\nwhich is right over here.\n\n32\n00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.952\nAnd then we're gonna immediately mute\nit so it's not like coming through\n\n33\n00:01:43.952 --> 00:01:47.636\nthe speakers and everything, just to\ngo ahead and get us familiar with that.\n\n34\n00:01:47.636 --> 00:01:50.120\nSo that's where I'd like to start.\n\n35\n00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.941\nSo why don't we go ahead and\nget down into the computer and\n\n36\n00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:57.475\nlet's talk about how do I\neven place the Skype call?\n\n37\n00:01:57.475 --> 00:02:00.100\nCuz we're not doing\nphone calls in this one.\n\n38\n00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.090\nThis is Justin, Justin only has Skype for\nBusiness, no phone plans and\n\n39\n00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.290\neverything like that.\n\n40\n00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.520\nSo if I wanted to contact Joey, or\nreally any of my contacts, okay?\n\n41\n00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.140\nFirst I'd see if they're available.\n\n42\n00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.290\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, gotta make sure that\n\n43\n00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.710\nthey have that.\n\n44\n00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.130\nAnd then you can\nright-click if you want and\n\n45\n00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.050\nyou can go to Call and\nthen you can see Skype Call.\n\n46\n00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.250\nNow, you do know that you have Voice Mail\nhere, so that means Joey has a phone.\n\n47\n00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.847\nThe other way you could do this is if you\nwanted you could hover over the person's\n\n48\n00:02:29.847 --> 00:02:33.685\nlittle picture and then there's\na drop down right here for Call.\n\n49\n00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:37.859\nNotice that I only have,\nVonne's account only has the Skype,\n\n50\n00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.450\ndoes not have phone, so\nthen I would go ahead and do a Skype call.\n\n51\n00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.542\nI think you can go into,\nyou can start a chat, okay?\n\n52\n00:02:45.542 --> 00:02:49.261\nSo if I brought up Joey and\nI started chatting first,\n\n53\n00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:51.889\nthat's not how you spell chatting.\n\n54\n00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:56.288\n[LAUGH] But you go ahead and\nstart like hey, we're IMing back and\n\n55\n00:02:56.288 --> 00:02:59.193\nforth and\nnow I want to pick up the phone and\n\n56\n00:02:59.193 --> 00:03:04.280\ntalk to the person, then there's\na button right here that has Call.\n\n57\n00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.890\nNow, just to show you, when you click\nit it doesn't actually place the call.\n\n58\n00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.620\nIt's going to give you the different\noptions based on the settings for\n\n59\n00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.520\nthat contacts account.\n\n60\n00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.110\nSo you can see there's a couple different\nways that you can get to the same place of\n\n61\n00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.420\nplacing a Skype call.\n\n62\n00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.500\nShould probably also mention,\n\n63\n00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.150\nbefore you start any of this you should\ncheck your audio settings, right?\n\n64\n00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.563\nSo just to make sure,\n\n65\n00:03:29.563 --> 00:03:34.743\nI'm gonna do that because I do know that I\nam plugged into what we call the AGA and\n\n66\n00:03:34.743 --> 00:03:39.161\nhow I'm, you guys are seeing my screen and\neverything like that.\n\n67\n00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:42.689\nAnd it does tend to default to that one.\n\n68\n00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.401\nAnd I checked this just before we started,\nbut let's double check.\n\n69\n00:03:47.401 --> 00:03:50.390\nCome into your Options, and\nyou go into your Audio device.\n\n70\n00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.630\nOkay, now I can see that\nmy microphone is working.\n\n71\n00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.177\nSo I know that's going good.\n\n72\n00:03:55.177 --> 00:03:58.692\nCuz notice up here, well it says\nCustom Device, but it will default to\n\n73\n00:03:58.692 --> 00:04:02.340\nwhere it will give me two different\noptions, where it will show the AGA.\n\n74\n00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.200\nI think cuz I went back this is the one,\n\n75\n00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.945\nthat's why it's not showing\nin the drop down anymore.\n\n76\n00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:10.704\nBut just in case you had multiple\nspeakers and multiple microphones,\n\n77\n00:04:10.704 --> 00:04:14.660\nyou need to make sure, double check\nthat my sound's gonna come through.\n\n78\n00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.368\n[SOUND] You get the nice,\nit's very soothing.\n\n79\n00:04:17.368 --> 00:04:18.055\n&gt;&gt;

So, we'll see if we can do about that,\n\n350\n00:18:46.254 --> 00:18:48.110\nbut I would get tickets first.\n\n351\n00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.780\n[LAUGH].\n\n352\n00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:54.850\nAll right so now,\nwhat about if somebody's not there?\n\n353\n00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:58.800\nOr what if I had just\nignored Renee's phone call?\n\n354\n00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.040\nIf I said, hm, you know what?\n\n355\n00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.472\nI don't feel like talking to Renee\nbecause she keeps calling me.\n\n356\n00:19:02.472 --> 00:19:04.538\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\nAbout those tickets, right?\n\n357\n00:19:04.538 --> 00:19:09.000\nSo I clicked that little button that said,\nI think hang up or ignore,\n\n358\n00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.640\nlike the red button basically.\n\n359\n00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.669\nNot the blue button, but the red button.\n\n360\n00:19:12.669 --> 00:19:15.359\nTake the red pill, or is it the blue pill?\n\n361\n00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:16.170\nI think it's the blue pill.\n\n362\n00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:17.103\n[LAUGH].\n\n363\n00:19:17.103 --> 00:19:20.090\nSo you can ignore it.\n\n364\n00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:21.880\nAnd what's going to happen?\n\n365\n00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.275\nRight here.\nActually, you know what,\n\n366\n00:19:23.275 --> 00:19:24.104\nRonnie is calling me.\n\n367\n00:19:24.104 --> 00:19:24.829\nYou know what?\n\n368\n00:19:24.829 --> 00:19:28.336\nI don't feel like talking to that guy,\nso I'm gonna go ahead [LAUGH] and\n\n369\n00:19:28.336 --> 00:19:29.113\nhang up on him.\n\n370\n00:19:29.113 --> 00:19:32.558\nAnd what's gonna show up on his end,\nnow remember,\n\n371\n00:19:32.558 --> 00:19:36.647\nme as Justin Timberlake,\nhe was calling Justin Timberlake.\n\n372\n00:19:36.647 --> 00:19:40.830\nI don't have a phone, so\nthis is what's gonna pop up for him.\n\n373\n00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.400\nIt's gonna say call was not completed.\n\n374\n00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:49.040\nOr has ended, because that's what the red\nbutton did, it ended the phone call.\n\n375\n00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.310\nSo, there's no voicemail, there's not\nanything, that's just what you're going to\n\n376\n00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:56.195\nget on the receiving end, if you call\nsomebody and they don't pick up.\n\n377\n00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:56.875\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n378\n00:19:56.875 --> 00:20:01.315\n&gt;&gt; I know on my Skype for\nBusiness on my Mac, I did the same thing.\n\n379\n00:20:01.315 --> 00:20:02.710\nIt actually says ignore.\n\n380\n00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:05.425\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Instead of the hang up button.\n\n381\n00:20:05.425 --> 00:20:07.385\n&gt;&gt; Just different interfaces\nthat do different things.\n\n382\n00:20:07.385 --> 00:20:09.825\nBut that's what you're going to see.\n\n383\n00:20:09.825 --> 00:20:14.655\nBut if I'm calling\nsomebody that has a phone\n\n384\n00:20:14.655 --> 00:20:19.840\nsystem set up,\nif they don't answer it goes to voicemail.\n\n385\n00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.530\nJust like you have in any regular phone,\n\n386\n00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:27.540\neven though I'm calling them as a Skype,\nokay?\n\n387\n00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:34.890\nSo, if I Skype called Joey and he doesn't\nanswer, it will go to the voicemail.\n\n388\n00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:39.680\nOr I could just go ahead and leave him a\nvoicemail right from here from my contact\n\n389\n00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.225\nlist, which I'm gonna do so we don't\nhave to sit here and just ring ring.\n\n390\n00:20:42.225 --> 00:20:44.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ring ring, I guess you could ring ring\n\n391\n00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:48.710\nand you could just hang up and\nit would go directly to it.\n\n392\n00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:49.620\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n393\n00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I would assume so.\n\n394\n00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.278\n&gt;&gt; All right, you know what?\n\n395\n00:20:51.278 --> 00:20:51.940\nWe're gonna do this.\n\n396\n00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.195\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna go ahead,\n\n397\n00:20:53.195 --> 00:21:00.582\nI'm going to Skype call Joey and\nyou're going to hit the end button.\n\n398\n00:21:00.582 --> 00:21:05.128\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt;

I'm glad to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:33.167\nSo yes,\nwe're going to be doing phone calls,\n\n10\n00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:37.464\nbecause in our last episode we did Skype\ncalls to where we can use our Skype for\n\n11\n00:00:37.464 --> 00:00:40.419\nBusiness client to go ahead and\nreach other Skype for\n\n12\n00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:44.780\nBusiness clients, and that's how we\ngo ahead and talk to each other.\n\n13\n00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.000\nWell now we're gonna get\ninto our phone systems.\n\n14\n00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.170\nAnd we're actually going to be using\nJoey's account today because Joey has\n\n15\n00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.120\na phone system and a phone number and\na calling plan and all that stuff.\n\n16\n00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.798\nSo we're gonna be using his account\nto be able to continue our series on\n\n17\n00:00:59.798 --> 00:01:00.761\naudio calls.\n\n18\n00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:05.264\nWe're going to start off with calling\nLance, our good friend Lance,\n\n19\n00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:08.800\nso we can look at the differences\nin our chat window.\n\n20\n00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.647\nI'm calling it a chat window,\nI guess we'll call it a call window.\n\n21\n00:01:10.647 --> 00:01:11.694\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n22\n00:01:11.694 --> 00:01:15.260\nbecause Lance is going to\nbe answering on Skype.\n\n23\n00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.118\nWe're going to call our\nfriend Renee as well and\n\n24\n00:01:18.118 --> 00:01:21.619\nsee how everything works when\nshe answers with her phone,\n\n25\n00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.712\nan actual physical phone set and\nnot her Skype for Business Client.\n\n26\n00:01:25.712 --> 00:01:27.850\nSo you guys can see the difference.\n\n27\n00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.445\nSo that's what were gonna be doing.\n\n28\n00:01:29.445 --> 00:01:32.809\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne,\nnow before we get started let make sure\n\n29\n00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:35.841\nthat everybody understands and\nwe make this clear.\n\n30\n00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:40.315\nI remember that the first time I started\nusing something like this I just\n\n31\n00:01:40.315 --> 00:01:43.674\nautomatically assumed that\nwhen you use the Skype for\n\n32\n00:01:43.674 --> 00:01:48.596\nBusiness on your computer that you even\nhad to do phone calls just over the Skype\n\n33\n00:01:48.596 --> 00:01:51.235\nfor Business app that's on my computer.\n\n34\n00:01:51.235 --> 00:01:55.050\nBut Vonne, we can actually tie this\ninto well a regular phone, right?\n\n35\n00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.990\n&gt;&gt; Yes exactly, and\n\n36\n00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.883\nwe had talked about this in our episode\nabout the understand audio calls.\n\n37\n00:01:59.883 --> 00:02:02.132\nThat's the title of that\nparticular episode.\n\n38\n00:02:02.132 --> 00:02:06.946\nSo if you haven't watched that, I would\nhighly suggest watching that cuz we really\n\n39\n00:02:06.946 --> 00:02:11.250\ndive into the difference between\nthe Skype calls and the phone calls.\n\n40\n00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.828\nYes, Joey does have special\nadd-ons to where he has\n\n41\n00:02:15.828 --> 00:02:20.824\nan actual phone number that is\nattached to his account and\n\n42\n00:02:20.824 --> 00:02:27.814\nthat he can use the phone to dial people\nand dial other people's phone numbers.\n\n43\n00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:32.445\nAnd that does not come automatically\nwith your Skype account.\n\n44\n00:02:32.445 --> 00:02:34.585\nIt has to be set up through administrator.\n\n45\n00:02:34.585 --> 00:02:38.060\nYou have to purchase your calling plans,\nand everything.\n\n46\n00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.910\nAnd if you're not on an organization\nthat has somebody that runs this,\n\n47\n00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.669\nthen you would have to go ahead and\npurchase that for\n\n48\n00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:47.763\nyour particular account to\nadd on all of these features.\n\n49\n00:02:47.763 --> 00:02:51.955\nSo yeah, it's not out of the box you can\ndial somebody and get a phone number.\n\n50\n00:02:51.955 --> 00:02:55.108\n&gt;&gt; All right, so yeah Vonne sometimes\nit's just a good reminder for\n\n51\n00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:57.934\nus as we continue moving on and\nlearning more about Skype.\n\n52\n00:02:57.934 --> 00:03:01.081\nSo Vonne, you had mentioned that we're\ngonna just make a phone call right\n\n53\n00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:01.700\nnow, right?\n\n54\n00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.377\n&gt;&gt; Yes exactly.\n\n55\n00:03:02.377 --> 00:03:05.095\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; And the way that you place a phone call\n\n56\n00:03:05.095 --> 00:03:09.270\nis pretty much the same way that\nyou can start any conversation.\n\n57\n00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.203\nYou start an IM,\nyou start a audio call, Skype call,\n\n58\n00:03:12.203 --> 00:03:16.069\nit's really just right clicking on\na contact, or all the other ways.\n\n59\n00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.730\nSo why don't we jump down in and\nget started.\n\n60\n00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.707\nSo as you could see, we got Joey here,\nand Joey is logged in right now.\n\n61\n00:03:23.707 --> 00:03:27.188\nHe doesn't have as many contacts\nas Justin just because,\n\n62\n00:03:27.188 --> 00:03:29.546\nwell he doesn't use his Skype as much.\n\n63\n00:03:29.546 --> 00:03:31.900\n[LAUGH] He's usually at the receiving end,\nnot the,\n\n64\n00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.747\nI'm going to be demonstrating\nfrom this particular account.\n\n65\n00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:37.696\nSo if I wanted to call somebody,\n\n66\n00:03:37.696 --> 00:03:42.520\nI tend to right-click on\na contact from my content.\n\n67\n00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.805\nThat is usually how I go with things.\n\n68\n00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:47.393\nI notice I'm right-clicking on Justin.\n\n69\n00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:52.382\nJustin's not online right now, because\nwell, he's over there on another account.\n\n70\n00:03:52.382 --> 00:03:55.108\nSo you can see that I have call, but\n\n71\n00:03:55.108 --> 00:04:01.142\nthis is the one where we talked about\nnow Justin does not have a phone system.\n\n72\n00:04:01.142 --> 00:04:05.278\nI know he doesn't because I, well,\nwe both actually manage his account, but\n\n73\n00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:10.070\nit says that there's a phone number\nattached, and it's (555) 579-1234.\n\n74\n00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.199\nIt's not a real number.\n\n75\n00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:17.492\nI'm seeing that as Joey,\nbecause that's part of Justin's\n\n76\n00:04:17.492 --> 00:04:23.010\ncontact card that he included\nhis phone number in his contact.\n\n77\n00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.653\nBut if I called this number,\none it doesn't exist, so\n\n78\n00:04:25.653 --> 00:04:26.983\nit's some made up number.\n\n79\n00:04:26.983 --> 00:04:29.835\nAnd two,\nI would be calling his cell phone,\n\n80\n00:04:29.835 --> 00:04:34.550\nhis mobile cell phone there because\nit's not gonna come through Skype.\n\n81\n00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.680\nHe cannot answer phone\ncalls on his Skype client.\n\n82\n00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.600\nBut he can answer it on his\nphone because remember,\n\n83\n00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.980\nJoey is using Skype just like a phone too.\n\n84\n00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.660\nSo I mean I know we all\nphone call all day.\n\n85\n00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.867\nSo it's the same principles are going\nto happen like Joey has a phone,\n\n86\n00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:55.445\nhe's gonna call Justin's phone,\nbut not through Skype.\n\n87\n00:04:55.445 --> 00:05:00.994\nSo just make sure that you know\nyour contacts' phone numbers and\n\n88\n00:05:00.994 --> 00:05:04.096\nwhere they're being directed to.\n\n89\n00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:09.610\nAnd what they can and cannot accept for\nyou, I guess you could say.\n\n90\n00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.850\nIf I come over here to Lance,\nwith Lance, if I go ahead and\n\n91\n00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.720\nstart a call, same thing here.\n\n92\n00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.990\nI know that Lance has his phone number\nthrough Skype for Business, but that's\n\n93\n00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.010\nnot it, I know that's not his phone number\nbecause, again, we manage his accounts.\n\n94\n00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.140\nSo don't always rely on\nyour contact card that\n\n95\n00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.210\npeople send to you or that you get\nfrom somebody as their Skype number.\n\n96\n00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.170\nIt's just like I'll have a work number,\nI have a cellphone number,\n\n97\n00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.760\nI could have a Skype number,\nI could have a second office number.\n\n98\n00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.502\nJust know that's how it goes.\n\n99\n00:05:49.502 --> 00:05:53.480\nAnd of course, notice that with Lance,\nI do have that option for voice mail.\n\n100\n00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.856\nI did not have that option in Justin.\n\n101\n00:05:55.856 --> 00:06:00.567\nNotice I can not just go ahead and\ngo directly to voicemail because, again,\n\n102\n00:06:00.567 --> 00:06:05.145\nhe doesn't have a phone system on his\naccount, so just double checking.\n\n103\n00:06:05.145 --> 00:06:10.184\nAnd I wanted to review something here\nthat I don't know if we specifically\n\n104\n00:06:10.184 --> 00:06:14.736\nwent over in the contact card and\nprivacy relationships episode,\n\n105\n00:06:14.736 --> 00:06:18.091\nis that you can,\nyou as in your user, you as you.\n\n106\n00:06:18.091 --> 00:06:19.605\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n107\n00:06:19.605 --> 00:06:21.382\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that was a little circular.\n\n108\n00:06:21.382 --> 00:06:24.577\nIf I go into my options,\nand I go into phones.\n\n109\n00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:31.465\nThis is where you can include your\nphone numbers with your contact card.\n\n110\n00:06:31.465 --> 00:06:36.860\nSo when somebody, say like Ronnie,\nadds Joey to his contact list in Skype for\n\n111\n00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.030\nBusiness, he's only going to\nsee one particular number.\n\n112\n00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.447\nWell maybe I wanna go ahead and\ninclude other ones in there.\n\n113\n00:06:44.447 --> 00:06:48.695\nAnd notice if I click on other phone,\nor I can go to work phone, so\n\n114\n00:06:48.695 --> 00:06:53.420\nyou could go ahead and add all these\ninformation and your contact card or\n\n115\n00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.350\nyour account, I guess you could say for\nthen other people will see it.\n\n116\n00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:03.041\nSo just making sure that you\nknow where you can edit that in\n\n117\n00:07:03.041 --> 00:07:07.553\nyour particular information\nthat goes out to people.\n\n118\n00:07:07.553 --> 00:07:11.040\nAll right, so\nwe're going to call Lance first.\n\n119\n00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.809\nNow, like I said, we could go this way,\nwe could also hover over his number and\n\n120\n00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:17.197\nthen go to a call here.\n\n121\n00:07:17.197 --> 00:07:21.257\nBut the way I'm gonna go to it, since I\ndon't have it connected to his contact\n\n122\n00:07:21.257 --> 00:07:24.980\ninformation, we're just gonna\ngo over here to the dial pad.\n\n123\n00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.350\nJust like I'm going to pick up\nmy phone and dial a number.\n\n124\n00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:28.529\nSo that's what we're going to do.\n\n125\n00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:32.424\nNow, Lance's number,\nI'm going to use my top row keys up here\n\n126\n00:07:32.424 --> 00:07:35.820\ninstead of clicking the buttons,\nit's a lot easier.\n\n127\n00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.189\nSo, his number is 352 3889119.\n\n128\n00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:44.273\nSo this is Lance's phone call,\nnow I'm gonna call him which is right over\n\n129\n00:07:44.273 --> 00:07:49.521\nwith Ronnie and we're gonna immediately\nmute our microphones so hopefully\n\n130\n00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:51.843\nwe don't get like too crazy in the-\n&gt;&gt; Feedback.\n\n131\n00:07:51.843 --> 00:07:55.491\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the feedback loop so\nlet's go ahead and call, and.\n\n132\n00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.021\nThere it goes [SOUND] Can\nyou hear the fun chiming.\n\n133\n00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:06.854\n[SOUND] All right.\n\n134\n00:08:06.854 --> 00:08:07.955\nThere we go.\n\n135\n00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:09.860\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n136\n00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.660\nSo, now I've seen that I\nhave muted my microphone.\n\n137\n00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.650\nSorry about that.\n\n138\n00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.940\nSo we don't get the crazy\nloop back that does happen.\n\n139\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.480\nOne, because we're on Mac it's like\na notorious thing that happens with\n\n140\n00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.550\naudio when using Mac computers is that\nyou get this loop back of where the.\n\n141\n00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.740\nAnd it may be at times through speakers is\ngetting picked up from your microphones\n\n142\n00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.475\nand then it does this like [SOUND].\n\n143\n00:08:33.475 --> 00:08:38.140\nSo if you've ever experienced that on\nphone calls or meetings, that's why.\n\n144\n00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.240\nI believe we have talked about\nthis in the Skype calls.\n\n145\n00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.780\nIf you're like, wait,\nyou've already talked about this.\n\n146\n00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.300\nYes, we have, but\nthis is a different episode.\n\n147\n00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.960\nSo, make sure,\n\n148\n00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:51.010\nthe way that you can- an easy way to avoid\nthis is just get a set of headphones.\n\n149\n00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:55.005\nJust go ahead and\nplug in your earbuds or iPods, iPods?\n\n150\n00:08:55.005 --> 00:08:58.810\n[LAUGH] Those things that go in your\near and connect to your computer,\n\n151\n00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.410\nwhichever way,\nit's going to make a huge difference.\n\n152\n00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.950\nSo headsets make all the difference\nof cancelling out the sound,\n\n153\n00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.090\nthe speakers that go here and\nyou here it and then the microphone.\n\n154\n00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.730\nSo there is no pick ups in that way so\n\n155\n00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.560\nthat's why I wanted to go ahead and\nget it.\n\n156\n00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.390\nPCs are not usually as bad,\nis that right Ronnie?\n\n157\n00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.710\n&gt;&gt; I think so, it just depends on\nthe way that it ends up working here.\n\n158\n00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.130\nSo for us,\nbecause the actual sound is coming out\n\n159\n00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.580\npretty much on the same card as\nthe recording is going into,\n\n160\n00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:32.680\nor the voice pickup is going into, that's\nwhere we're getting that feedback loop.\n\n161\n00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.150\nSo anything that you can do using\na headset is probably the easiest method\n\n162\n00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.920\nthat you can do, but there's probably\nother ways that this can be done, too.\n\n163\n00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.250\nSetting the microphone,\nactually not using the internal or\n\n164\n00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:48.570\nthe built-in one, using the external one,\nusing again headphones.\n\n165\n00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.413\nThose are probably all good ways\nthat you can separate that out.\n\n166\n00:09:51.413 --> 00:09:56.227\n&gt;&gt; I didn't think about the external\ndevice like a separate microphone\n\n167\n00:09:56.227 --> 00:10:00.970\nbecause we're doing with the all\nintegrated laptop video, yeah.\n\n168\n00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:02.510\nSo that might be something.\n\n169\n00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:06.350\nBut PC's I felt in my experience,\nthroughout my history,\n\n170\n00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.350\nthey weren't as bad I would say,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n171\n00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.387\n&gt;&gt; Mac's,\nit's just like it's always gonna happen.\n\n172\n00:10:11.387 --> 00:10:14.970\n[LAUGH] All right, so now,\nas we're going through this,\n\n173\n00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.340\nwhy did I wanna bring up this\nparticular person at Lance.\n\n174\n00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.020\nNotice it's like this doesn't look\nthat much different than when we made\n\n175\n00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.480\nSkype calls.\n\n176\n00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.088\nYou're right, because it's not.\n\n177\n00:10:25.088 --> 00:10:29.760\n[LAUGH] Because Lance answered\nthis phone call from me\n\n178\n00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.150\nthrough his Skype for business client.\n\n179\n00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.550\nHe doesn't have a physical\nphone that he is answering on.\n\n180\n00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.410\nHe doesn't have a headset,\na headphone, and everything like that.\n\n181\n00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:45.200\nSo you're gonna see everything\nlike a regular Skype call.\n\n182\n00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.850\nYou could turn on your video and\neverything.\n\n183\n00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.070\nYou could share content and\n\n184\n00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:56.150\nall of the different things you normally\nsee in any type of regular Skype type.\n\n185\n00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.599\nSkype type, wow,\nhow many times am I gonna loop on this?\n\n186\n00:10:58.599 --> 00:10:59.220\n&gt;&gt; Skype call, yeah.\n\n187\n00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.900\n&gt;&gt; Talk about audio looping.\n\n188\n00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.230\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; I'm looping.\n\n189\n00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.690\nAll right, so that's just\nsomething that's gonna happen, but\n\n190\n00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.700\nwe still are talking\nthrough our phone systems.\n\n191\n00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.590\nI called him on his number and\nhe's answering, so that's what we see.\n\n192\n00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:15.830\nSo, in case you're looking at this and\nbe, that doesn't look much different,\n\n193\n00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.400\nit's just the manner in which\nI place the call to him and\n\n194\n00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.980\nhow he went ahead and\nanswered that phone call.\n\n195\n00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:27.200\nSo, if you want more information on Skype\ncalls, go back and watch that episode cuz\n\n196\n00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.790\nthat's all we're really gonna go ahead and\ndo on this particular example.\n\n197\n00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.560\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\nhang up with Lance.\n\n198\n00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.590\nYou can see that it's still gonna\ngo ahead and bring up, ooh,\n\n199\n00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.790\nit's doing all sorts of fun stuff.\n\n200\n00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.924\nA lot of times, it will go ahead and\nkeep that chat that you had,\n\n201\n00:11:42.924 --> 00:11:46.746\nif you had any IMs going in\nthat particular conversation,\n\n202\n00:11:46.746 --> 00:11:51.351\nit'll go ahead and pop back up with\nthe remaining of your chat window.\n\n203\n00:11:51.351 --> 00:11:54.462\nAnd then you can go ahead and close that\nsince I'm pretty sure since we didn't chat\n\n204\n00:11:54.462 --> 00:11:56.010\nanything it just went ahead and closed.\n\n205\n00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:59.080\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And everything is fine with that so\n\n206\n00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.510\nthat's what you can do.\n\n207\n00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:05.467\nNow what we're gonna do here is we're\ngonna call somebody else, our friend\n\n208\n00:12:05.467 --> 00:12:11.310\nRenee and Renee is going to not answer\nthis call with her Skype client.\n\n209\n00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:16.930\nI know because I sit right next to her and\nshe primarily uses her phone for\n\n210\n00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.070\nany type of audio communication\nthat she has with people.\n\n211\n00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:24.130\nSo we're gonna go ahead and give her\na call, we're gonna use a dial pad again.\n\n212\n00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.290\nBecause I don't have her phone\nnumber associated with her contact,\n\n213\n00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.850\nwhich I could have easily just\ngone ahead and added my contact,\n\n214\n00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:35.790\nedited it in my Outlook contact and\nthen go ahead and her everything ready.\n\n215\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.703\nBut, let's use dial pad.\n\n216\n00:12:37.703 --> 00:12:39.504\nSo we'll do 352-600-6915.\n\n217\n00:12:39.504 --> 00:12:47.403\nAnd here we go, we're gonna go ahead and\ncall Ms. Renee.\n\n218\n00:12:47.403 --> 00:12:51.852\nGet connected.\n[SOUND]\n\n219\n00:12:51.852 --> 00:12:57.010\n&gt;&gt; Hello, this is Renee.\n\n220\n00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.390\n&gt;&gt; Hi, Renee.\nThis is Joey Patone.\n\n221\n00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:59.030\nHow are you?\n\n222\n00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:01.230\n&gt;&gt; Hi, Joey.\n\n223\n00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.350\nI'm good.\nHow are you?\n\n224\n00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.920\n&gt;&gt; I'm wonderful.\n\n225\n00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.720\nI just wanted to say hello to you and\nsee how everything was going.\n\n226\n00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.740\n&gt;&gt; Everything's going great.\n\n227\n00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.660\nYou know I was just talking\nto Justin yesterday.\n\n228\n00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.846\nI wanted to see if you heard anything\nabout him getting these tickets to\n\n229\n00:13:15.846 --> 00:13:17.250\nthe Super Bowl Halftime Show?\n\n230\n00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:23.220\n&gt;&gt; Well you know, I'm gonna have to put\nyou on hold and get back to you on that.\n\n231\n00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.610\nMaybe I'll get Vonne and\nsee what she says, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:27.990\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, one second.\n\n233\n00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.040\nSo you can see that I went ahead and\nput her on hold here.\n\n234\n00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.660\nBut notice in this chat window or\nin this call window I don't see the video,\n\n235\n00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.450\nI don't see her picture,\nI see the dial pad.\n\n236\n00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:43.730\nThis is the interface you're going\nto experience when you have somebody\n\n237\n00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.780\nthat is answering your phone\ncall to them with their phone.\n\n238\n00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.260\nSo, you can see I've got the resume.\n\n239\n00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.330\nI have all the regular call buttons\nthat we saw in a Skype call right here.\n\n240\n00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.860\nSo, now what I'm going to do is\nI'm gonna resume this call and\n\n241\n00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.800\nthen I'm gonna go ahead and\ncome back in as Vonne and not Joey, so-\n\n242\n00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.410\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne,\n\n243\n00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.555\nwe do need to remember something\nthat may happen here that could be\n\n244\n00:14:05.555 --> 00:14:08.490\na little bit discomforting\nat the other end.\n\n245\n00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.300\nWhich is because of the way that\nwe're answering it through the Skype,\n\n246\n00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.740\nwe're still having that loop issue\nthat could be caused on the other end.\n\n247\n00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:18.140\nSo if you're doing this\nagain headphones or\n\n248\n00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.810\na redirected mic is probably\nthe better way to go.\n\n249\n00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:25.240\nBut Vonne could probably do this while\nshe's talking is to simply mute it\n\n250\n00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.770\nwhile she's talking and then you can\ntalk and unmute your microphone.\n\n251\n00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.450\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I know right now that when\nwe were just chatting with Renee,\n\n252\n00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.270\nshe's hearing that loopback on her end.\n\n253\n00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:43.460\nSo anytime that she was talking,\nshe's hearing herself back in her phone.\n\n254\n00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.040\nAnd I know it drives her crazy.\n\n255\n00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.290\nI know it drives me crazy too, and\nI'm like, let's just go for it.\n\n256\n00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.960\nSo what we're gonna do now is when I come\nback on, we're gonna almost play it.\n\n257\n00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.720\nIt's almost like a CB radio.\n\n258\n00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.670\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; I have to let her talk, and\n\n259\n00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.420\nwhile she's talking I'm\ngonna mute my microphone.\n\n260\n00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.360\nAnd then when I'm ready to talk,\nI'm gonna turn my mic phone back on and\n\n261\n00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.660\ntalk to her so that way,\nwe don't get that loop back.\n\n262\n00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.680\nSo when you see me doing that,\nthat's what's going on so yeah.\n\n263\n00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.430\n&gt;&gt; It's something that does happen.\n\n264\n00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:18.201\nSomething that you might now know exactly\nwhat to do when it happens right away but\n\n265\n00:15:18.201 --> 00:15:21.370\nVonne is just giving you\nvery important tip, right?\n\n266\n00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.292\nSimply mute it when the, mute it, muted.\n\n267\n00:15:23.292 --> 00:15:24.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n268\n00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.960\n&gt;&gt; Simply mute your own microphone if\n\n269\n00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.840\nyou're using the Skype client while\nthe other end is talking, and\n\n270\n00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.890\nthen when you're ready to talk, unmute it.\n\n271\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.630\nIt is a little bit tricky at that point,\nbut that's why you go for headphones, or\n\n272\n00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:39.730\na separate microphone is what would\nbe probably the easier thing to do.\n\n273\n00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is one of those things.\n\n274\n00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.390\nI'm gonna go ahead and take her off hold.\n\n275\n00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:48.207\nShe's probably, we told her that we were\ngonna be doing an episode [LAUGH] so\n\n276\n00:15:48.207 --> 00:15:52.578\nI'm going to go ahead and now I've\nresumed my call and I am off hold.\n\n277\n00:15:52.578 --> 00:15:57.027\nSo now this is me, this is Vonne and\nRenee I have just gone through and\n\n278\n00:15:57.027 --> 00:16:02.280\ntold everybody about our fun loop back\nexperience that you might be hearing so.\n\n279\n00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.429\nYeah, we're gonna do our CB radio now,\nand see if we're [LAUGH],\n\n280\n00:16:06.429 --> 00:16:07.871\nif this is gonna work.\n\n281\n00:16:07.871 --> 00:16:10.863\nSo that way,\nit kind of alleviates on her end, and\n\n282\n00:16:10.863 --> 00:16:13.659\nthis is something that\nyou might experience.\n\n283\n00:16:13.659 --> 00:16:16.908\nLike Ronnie was saying,\nif your person's like, man, dude,\n\n284\n00:16:16.908 --> 00:16:20.660\nyou are coming through my speakers,\nit is like I'm hearing myself.\n\n285\n00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.227\nLike, okay, so let's just go ahead and\ndo the microphone button,\n\n286\n00:16:24.227 --> 00:16:26.751\nthe mute button game, and\nit should be a lot of fun.\n\n287\n00:16:26.751 --> 00:16:30.382\nSo I am checking on those tickets and\nI'm sorry,\n\n288\n00:16:30.382 --> 00:16:34.295\nRenee, I'm gonna probably\nget them first [LAUGH].\n\n289\n00:16:34.295 --> 00:16:40.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, so\nyou can see that this is how it's going.\n\n290\n00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:42.464\nSo Renee, if you don't mind,\n\n291\n00:16:42.464 --> 00:16:48.381\ncould you maybe just give us just kind of\nyour use of your phone, and how it works?\n\n292\n00:16:48.381 --> 00:16:51.386\nCuz I know you said you\nuse mostly your phone, and\n\n293\n00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:54.551\nthen maybe talk about your cellphone and\nyour app.\n\n294\n00:16:54.551 --> 00:16:56.760\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nmute, and you're gonna go.\n\n295\n00:16:59.078 --> 00:17:05.495\n&gt;&gt; All right, yeah, perfect, what I like,\nI can use Skype on my desk phone.\n\n296\n00:17:05.495 --> 00:17:09.125\nAnd when I add coworkers to\nmy favorites in my Skype app,\n\n297\n00:17:09.125 --> 00:17:11.770\nthey show up on my phone's display.\n\n298\n00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:17.657\nSo that way, I can speed dial using\nSkype right through my phone display.\n\n299\n00:17:17.657 --> 00:17:21.414\nI can also make calls outside our\norganization, just as I would on\n\n300\n00:17:21.414 --> 00:17:25.855\na regular phone, and there's nothing I\nneed to do to switch between Skype and\n\n301\n00:17:25.855 --> 00:17:27.449\nregular calls on my phone.\n\n302\n00:17:27.449 --> 00:17:34.130\nI just dial and go, and I do also use\nthe Skype app on my mobile phone.\n\n303\n00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:37.297\nSo I could take calls on my cell\nphone when I'm out of the office.\n\n304\n00:17:37.297 --> 00:17:42.190\nIt's definitely easy to download the app\nand sign in just like on my PC, and\n\n305\n00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:47.329\nagain, once I'm signed in, there's no\nother setup I need to do to get going.\n\n306\n00:17:47.329 --> 00:17:50.848\nI just log in,\nI can make calls, take calls,\n\n307\n00:17:50.848 --> 00:17:54.660\nand it works just like I\nwould from my desk phone.\n\n308\n00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.024\n&gt;&gt;

All right Vonne, thank you again for\n\n438\n00:25:12.777 --> 00:25:16.978\nhelping us to understand more about the\nway that we can manage these phone calls.\n\n439\n00:25:16.978 --> 00:25:20.500\nIt seems easy enough,\nyou dial a number and you pick up.\n\n440\n00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:24.530\nBut remember, Vonne showed us some of the\nfeatures that are in the way that we can\n\n441\n00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:26.500\nuse a Skype for Business plan.\n\n442\n00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.654\nThe ability to transfer to the call,\nto put it on hold,\n\n443\n00:25:29.654 --> 00:25:32.340\nto stop and\nconsult with someone as we need to.\n\n444\n00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:37.223\nAnd this is all regardless of whether\nwe're connecting through our Skype client\n\n445\n00:25:37.223 --> 00:25:42.340\nitself, or whether we're actually on\na handset somewhere, whatever it might be.\n\n446\n00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.583\nOr even as Renee told us right on\nthe show, where she could transfer it to\n\n447\n00:25:46.583 --> 00:25:50.851\nthe Skype for Business app that she\nhas downloaded on her phone as well.\n\n448\n00:25:50.851 --> 00:25:53.685\nAnd that makes this a very\npowerful little utility, and\n\n449\n00:25:53.685 --> 00:25:55.744\nit gives you so many different options.\n\n450\n00:25:55.744 --> 00:25:59.362\nIt's not just simply you picking up the\nphone and dialing, it can be as simple as\n\n451\n00:25:59.362 --> 00:26:03.050\nthat, but there are many more features\nthat you can take advantage of.\n\n452\n00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:07.640\nSo once again, thank you also for\njoining us, signing off for OfficeProTV,\n\n453\n00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.080\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n454\n00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:09.752\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n455\n00:26:09.752 --> 00:26:13.062\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned here for\nmore Skype for Business shows.\n\n456\n00:26:13.062 --> 00:26:16.595\n[SOUND]\n\n",

Thank you so much,\nalways love being here with you.\n\n10\n00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:38.146\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne so, here it is we've\ntalked a lot about the phone calls and\n\n11\n00:00:38.146 --> 00:00:41.351\nmanaging them because\nthere's a lot of features.\n\n12\n00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:45.178\nNow we need to jump into the settings\nbecause just when I think there's not more\n\n13\n00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:46.926\nto learn, there's more to learn.\n\n14\n00:00:46.926 --> 00:00:48.360\nSo, Vonne, where are we going?\n\n15\n00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.230\n&gt;&gt; Always, right?\n\n16\n00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.782\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, since Joey,\n\n17\n00:00:50.782 --> 00:00:54.870\nthe account that we're using,\nthat has the phone system and a call plan.\n\n18\n00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.658\nSince he has us on his Skype for business\naccount, there's some other things\n\n19\n00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:03.355\nthat are associated with a phone\nthat we haven't covered.\n\n20\n00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:05.562\nLike your voicemail, setting up,\n\n21\n00:01:05.562 --> 00:01:09.250\nwhat's your greeting that\npeople are going to be hearing.\n\n22\n00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.817\nAnd there's some other settings that\nyou can do in Skype that is tied\n\n23\n00:01:12.817 --> 00:01:14.201\nto your Outlook account.\n\n24\n00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:17.952\nAnd because we know that\nthe symmetry between Outlook and\n\n25\n00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:22.810\nsite for businesses is very, I don't\nknow if symmetry is the right word.\n\n26\n00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.484\n&gt;&gt; Connection.\n\n27\n00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:24.057\n&gt;&gt; Symbiosis?\n\n28\n00:01:24.057 --> 00:01:26.545\n&gt;&gt; Symbiotic relationship?\n\n29\n00:01:26.545 --> 00:01:27.081\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or synergy?\n\n30\n00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:29.110\nSynergy?\n&gt;&gt; Synergy, there we go.\n\n31\n00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.340\n&gt;&gt; We like synergy.\n\n32\n00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.280\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; I was looking for\n\n33\n00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.481\nsome word that started with S, and\nI was like, that didn't work at all.\n\n34\n00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:36.869\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I could have come up with\na lot of words that start with S, but\n\n35\n00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.266\nthey're probably not appropriate.\n\n36\n00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So all right, Vonne.\n\n37\n00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.988\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So here we go.\n\n38\n00:01:40.988 --> 00:01:46.805\n&gt;&gt; So yes, Skype for Business, Outlook\nconnected, let's go into the settings.\n\n39\n00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:48.497\n[LAUGH] So we have Joey's account.\n\n40\n00:01:48.497 --> 00:01:50.480\nWe have already signed in,\n\n41\n00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.060\non this particular computer that\nI'm using for this account.\n\n42\n00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.980\nThis is my old Macbook, this is my 2010\nMacbook, this old girl's still kicking.\n\n43\n00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.924\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She's a little slow.\n\n44\n00:02:02.924 --> 00:02:05.117\n[LAUGH] So, I went ahead and\n\n45\n00:02:05.117 --> 00:02:11.190\npulled up some things that I know\nwe're going to need automatically.\n\n46\n00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.540\nSo, some of the things that you see it\nsays, click here, and it opens up Outlook.\n\n47\n00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.947\nI didn't want you all to have to sit\nthere and watch the wheels spin.\n\n48\n00:02:17.947 --> 00:02:20.786\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; On this old gal right here, so.\n\n49\n00:02:20.786 --> 00:02:25.608\nAll right, so we have Joey, right away\ndown at the bottom you can see that\n\n50\n00:02:25.608 --> 00:02:30.050\nyou have a different bar if you\nwant to say, a status bar that.\n\n51\n00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.341\nIf somebody does not have a phone\nsystem they are not gonna see this and\n\n52\n00:02:33.341 --> 00:02:34.775\nit says call forwarding off.\n\n53\n00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:39.177\nOkay, and then, there's this little button\nright next to it, that as you can see,\n\n54\n00:02:39.177 --> 00:02:41.535\ngoes into some of these\ndifferent settings.\n\n55\n00:02:41.535 --> 00:02:45.042\nSo why don't we talk\nabout call forwarding.\n\n56\n00:02:45.042 --> 00:02:48.305\nI'm going to be out of the country for\ntwo weeks.\n\n57\n00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:49.716\nThat would be really fun.\n\n58\n00:02:49.716 --> 00:02:55.840\nAnd I need to have anybody that calls\nJoey Fatone at his phone number.\n\n59\n00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.355\nI need to forward it to my assistant or\nI need to forward it on to Lance cuz he's\n\n60\n00:03:00.355 --> 00:03:03.406\ngonna be taking over while\nI'm out of the country.\n\n61\n00:03:03.406 --> 00:03:06.606\nSo that's something that\nyou can go ahead and do and\n\n62\n00:03:06.606 --> 00:03:11.550\nyou can see where I can do it all right\ndown here from this little button.\n\n63\n00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.787\nThis is actually going into\nall of your settings and\n\n64\n00:03:14.787 --> 00:03:17.957\nyour options that are in your Skype for\nbusiness.\n\n65\n00:03:17.957 --> 00:03:22.990\nAnd then simultaneously ring, that's\nthe same thing like your cellphone, right?\n\n66\n00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.605\nSo, that way you have a choice.\n\n67\n00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:27.497\nIt is also going to ring on your\nphone [LAUGH] I immediately go\n\n68\n00:03:27.497 --> 00:03:28.509\nto the back pocket.\n\n69\n00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.640\nYour phone and your Skype for\nbusiness client.\n\n70\n00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.995\nAnd then you can choose\nwhich one that it goes to.\n\n71\n00:03:33.995 --> 00:03:36.120\nOr maybe you have like another number.\n\n72\n00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.352\nLike you are at a, the satellite office,\nthat you're not normally at, but\n\n73\n00:03:40.352 --> 00:03:42.681\nyou have the phone system all connected.\n\n74\n00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:45.790\nYou might need to talk to your IT guys\nto make sure all that stuff works.\n\n75\n00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.138\nBut you can see that it makes pretty\nmuch sense would simultaneously ring to\n\n76\n00:03:50.138 --> 00:03:51.180\nanother device.\n\n77\n00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Vonne, to tell you the truth,\nwe both know Tim.\n\n78\n00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.320\nAnd this is the way that he has\nit set up regardless of whether\n\n79\n00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.633\nit is desktop phone ringing or\nwhether his iPhone.\n\n80\n00:04:02.633 --> 00:04:05.802\nThat was he always carries.\n\n81\n00:04:05.802 --> 00:04:09.764\nIt actually does ring in both places,\nso you can answer on either one.\n\n82\n00:04:09.764 --> 00:04:10.910\n&gt;&gt; It's like [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH].\n\n83\n00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.577\nSound, coming off sometimes in\noffice when he gets a phone call.\n\n84\n00:04:15.577 --> 00:04:18.898\nCuz it's like, he has got his iPad,\nhe has got his iPhone.\n\n85\n00:04:18.898 --> 00:04:20.333\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's true, I forgot that,\nhe's got everything.\n\n86\n00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:21.672\n&gt;&gt; Speakers, I mean he's got everything.\n\n87\n00:04:21.672 --> 00:04:26.500\nI mean, he is literally like,\nhe's a techy junkie.\n\n88\n00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.945\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I mean, so\n\n89\n00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:30.490\nit's kind of this whole thing.\n\n90\n00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.042\nA chorus that comes out of his\noffice when somebody calls him.\n\n91\n00:04:33.042 --> 00:04:36.701\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But it does make sense\nespecially if you are waiting for\n\n92\n00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:38.380\nan important call.\n\n93\n00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.485\nAnd you're not gonna be\nby that phone all day.\n\n94\n00:04:41.485 --> 00:04:44.062\nIt allows you then to just say, all right,\n\n95\n00:04:44.062 --> 00:04:48.490\nI'm just gonna have a ring on\nthe devices that I want it to ring on.\n\n96\n00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.419\nAnd that way you don't miss it, you don't\nhave to wait and return a call, and\n\n97\n00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:53.883\ntry and play that phone tag.\n\n98\n00:04:53.883 --> 00:04:57.590\nIt's just gonna ring and you're gonna\npick it up, and that kinda makes it nice.\n\n99\n00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.028\nEspecially with that person\nthat is anxiously waiting, and\n\n100\n00:05:00.028 --> 00:05:03.148\nthat's pretty much all of us, especially\nif we're expecting a phone call.\n\n101\n00:05:03.148 --> 00:05:06.617\n&gt;&gt; That's a really good example, I'm\nglad you brought that up, I'm like yeah,\n\n102\n00:05:06.617 --> 00:05:08.750\nthat's a perfect reason\nwhy I'd want to do that.\n\n103\n00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.423\nSo down at the bottom it's going\ninto our call forwarding settings.\n\n104\n00:05:12.423 --> 00:05:14.050\nSo I'm gonna just go and click on that.\n\n105\n00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.818\nAnd it's bringing us right into\nour Skype for Business option.\n\n106\n00:05:16.818 --> 00:05:20.848\nSo I totally could have gotten to this\nfrom the little wheel that we've gone to\n\n107\n00:05:20.848 --> 00:05:23.280\nmany, many times in all of our episodes.\n\n108\n00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.022\nSo you can see I had the call forwarding.\n\n109\n00:05:25.022 --> 00:05:27.972\nAnd if you're in your account saying,\nI don't have that,\n\n110\n00:05:27.972 --> 00:05:29.690\nyou don't have a phone system.\n\n111\n00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.205\nSo that is just an option that\nwill show up in your Skype for\n\n112\n00:05:33.205 --> 00:05:37.254\nBusiness options with this\nparticular plan in add-ons in here.\n\n113\n00:05:37.254 --> 00:05:41.076\nSo you can see it's got\nthe forwarding my phone calls to and\n\n114\n00:05:41.076 --> 00:05:44.430\nyou can actually send it\nright to Skype voicemail.\n\n115\n00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.049\nYou're like hey I don't want to\nbe disturbed, different numbers,\n\n116\n00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:47.779\nthings like that.\n\n117\n00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:53.830\nWe can go into simultaneously ring, we've\ngot those other numbers and everything.\n\n118\n00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.042\nThe team call group and delegates,\n\n119\n00:05:56.042 --> 00:06:00.834\nthose are other things that honestly\nwe're not gonna get too far into because\n\n120\n00:06:00.834 --> 00:06:04.236\nit is very specific to how\nyour organization is set up.\n\n121\n00:06:04.236 --> 00:06:08.789\nTeam call group it's one of\nthose it's like when we have\n\n122\n00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:13.630\nsomebody call ITPro.TV,\nit goes to quite a few different people.\n\n123\n00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.842\nLike different accounts, and so\nyou can think that it's like\n\n124\n00:06:16.842 --> 00:06:20.196\na team that can answer a call or\na that has access to the same line.\n\n125\n00:06:20.196 --> 00:06:22.860\nI think this gets into like bridges and\nthings like that, right?\n\n126\n00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.722\n&gt;&gt; It really does, so at this point,\nif you are using this,\n\n127\n00:06:25.722 --> 00:06:27.821\nit just depends on what you need it for\nso.\n\n128\n00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:31.671\nThis is fairly specific for\nexample, what we want to do,\n\n129\n00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:36.404\nif you call in the IT Pro TV,\nwe have a particular number that you call,\n\n130\n00:06:36.404 --> 00:06:40.090\nthat we expect, of course,\nit to be answered.\n\n131\n00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.530\nBut there's sometimes where if it doesn't\nget answered by the first or second ring,\n\n132\n00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.073\nor third ring, whatever it might be.\n\n133\n00:06:45.073 --> 00:06:48.553\nThat what we do is we ring\na number of phone calls instead.\n\n134\n00:06:48.553 --> 00:06:51.220\nAnd that way,\nsomebody is going to pick up.\n\n135\n00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.218\nAnd this is a lot different than the way\nit was in the early days of ITPRO.TV where\n\n136\n00:06:55.218 --> 00:06:59.051\nwe had one phone on and it just ring\non every single phone that we had.\n\n137\n00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:04.296\nWhich was interesting because that\nmeant you could kinda call get me and\n\n138\n00:07:04.296 --> 00:07:08.150\nask me a technical or\na member support question.\n\n139\n00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.085\nAnd I just have to kind of put\nyou on hold and then wait,\n\n140\n00:07:11.085 --> 00:07:13.901\ninstead of actually allowing\nthat person to do so.\n\n141\n00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:17.617\nBy using a feature like this,\nyou can have it directed to\n\n142\n00:07:17.617 --> 00:07:21.030\njust a specific number of phones or\nphone numbers.\n\n143\n00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.440\nAnd it's, here's the group, or to those\nusers, and that's what this is about.\n\n144\n00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is somewhat along,\nwell maybe not exactly the same lines.\n\n145\n00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.971\nBut the delegates.\n\n146\n00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:33.046\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; This is where we talk about delegating\n\n147\n00:07:33.046 --> 00:07:35.904\naccess or authority, if you wanna say,\n\n148\n00:07:35.904 --> 00:07:40.640\nto users in Outlook to where,\nhey, I want for example Renee.\n\n149\n00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.138\nI notice that she does a lot of\nstuff in Tim's email calendars or\n\n150\n00:07:44.138 --> 00:07:45.993\nat least try to keep him on track.\n\n151\n00:07:45.993 --> 00:07:50.940\nSo he has added Renee as\na delegate to his account.\n\n152\n00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.158\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so it distributed the same,\n\n153\n00:07:53.158 --> 00:07:55.739\nit's a same thing in Skype for Business.\n\n154\n00:07:55.739 --> 00:07:56.756\n&gt;&gt; A new one, yep.\n\n155\n00:07:56.756 --> 00:07:58.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, is that this delegate,\nthis person,\n\n156\n00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.173\nthat I have allowed\naccess into my accounts.\n\n157\n00:08:01.173 --> 00:08:03.993\nOr account, or\nAccount Settings you should say.\n\n158\n00:08:03.993 --> 00:08:09.160\nThey can go ahead and answer on my behalf,\nall of those different things now.\n\n159\n00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.980\nAnd again, this get's into\na little bit more, it's really-\n\n160\n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:12.890\n&gt;&gt; Business management.\n\n161\n00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:16.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the administrative end\nof your accounts and whether or\n\n162\n00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.550\nnot you have this,\nyou don't have it, what groups or\n\n163\n00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.810\nwho you have as your delegate, or\nyou're delegating to somebody else.\n\n164\n00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.330\nSo those are the different ones on there.\n\n165\n00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.100\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust turn all the call forwarding off.\n\n166\n00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.100\nI don't want any of these numbers\ngoing over to you, Ronnie.\n\n167\n00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.388\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n168\n00:08:34.388 --> 00:08:35.854\n&gt;&gt; And well, not many people\nare gonna be calling Joey really, so.\n\n169\n00:08:35.854 --> 00:08:39.328\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the other thing that we have down in\n\n170\n00:08:39.328 --> 00:08:43.293\nhere, notice it does have\nEdit my call members, or\n\n171\n00:08:43.293 --> 00:08:46.910\nmy group calls and my delegate members.\n\n172\n00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:51.042\nAnd then it goes on, Unanswered calls\nwill go to Voice Mail in 20 seconds.\n\n173\n00:08:51.042 --> 00:08:54.737\nOkay, so if you click on that,\nyou can actually set, hey,\n\n174\n00:08:54.737 --> 00:09:00.290\nmaybe it's gonna go much quicker or\nnot take maybe a little bit longer.\n\n175\n00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.840\nGive you more time to answer\nyour phone if needed.\n\n176\n00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.760\nSo you can set when it does go to\nvoicemail for unanswered calls.\n\n177\n00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.740\nI like this one, Ronnie.\n\n178\n00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.880\nThese settings will apply all the time,\n\n179\n00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.260\nor during the work hours\nthat you set in Outlook.\n\n180\n00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.007\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n181\n00:09:18.007 --> 00:09:22.810\nNow this does get into setting\nwork hours in Outlook.\n\n182\n00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.160\nAnd you can see it actually has\na little button right there.\n\n183\n00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.164\nWe'll learn more,\nI'll take you out onto the website and\n\n184\n00:09:28.164 --> 00:09:31.670\nit will tell you on the support.office.com\nof how you can do that.\n\n185\n00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.900\nSo pretty neat.\n\n186\n00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:38.450\nSo it's all tied, again, to that\nsymbiosis of our Outlook calendars.\n\n187\n00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.843\nSo you can go ahead and\nuse that setting if you wanted to.\n\n188\n00:09:40.843 --> 00:09:45.060\nI'm gonna click OK for\nall the time, all right.\n\n189\n00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:50.020\nAnd so there's a couple other things, more\ncall settings, Show or hide my caller ID.\n\n190\n00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.310\nThis is that, I wanna be anonymous, right?\n\n191\n00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.920\nAnd you know what happens when\nI get phone calls like that?\n\n192\n00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.935\nI don't answer them.\n\n193\n00:09:56.935 --> 00:09:59.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, or even, you know what?\n\n194\n00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.914\nIf I have a number that I don't recognize,\nI don't answer that either.\n\n195\n00:10:03.914 --> 00:10:07.960\nSo now notice that it is going\nout to your account settings.\n\n196\n00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.230\nSo let's just see if I can remember\nour password there, Ronnie.\n\n197\n00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.340\nThis is Joey, Joey is slightly different.\n\n198\n00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.710\nI got it, sweet.\n\n199\n00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.300\nAnd I'm not gonna necessarily\nstay signed in all the time.\n\n200\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.293\nBut it is nice that\nthey're asking us that.\n\n201\n00:10:21.293 --> 00:10:22.309\nAnd this was kind of,\n\n202\n00:10:22.309 --> 00:10:24.250\nI feel like this is a newer-\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n203\n00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.824\n&gt;&gt; Prompt that I've been noticing lately,\nat the time of this recording, that is.\n\n204\n00:10:27.824 --> 00:10:28.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So [LAUGH].\n\n205\n00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.530\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, the sign-in is different.\n&gt;&gt; The sign-in page, it's like,\n\n209\n00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:39.293\nyou need to be going\nto the new experience,\n\n210\n00:10:39.293 --> 00:10:40.628\ncuz I had bookmarked the old one.\n\n211\n00:10:40.628 --> 00:10:43.600\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:17.790\nYou're watching the Skype for\nBusiness show.\n\n4\n00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.410\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong,\nand today, we're gonna\n\n5\n00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.250\nbe helping you share your desktop or\nwindow using Skype for Business.\n\n6\n00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.342\nAnd here to help us, of course, is gonna\nbe our queen of OfficePro.TV, herself,\n\n7\n00:00:29.342 --> 00:00:30.282\nMiss Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:31.500\nVonne, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.460\n&gt;&gt; I like being queen.\n\n10\n00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.168\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n11\n00:00:33.168 --> 00:00:34.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne.\n\n12\n00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.580\nHere it is, we are in this particular\nepisode, to show some of the different\n\n13\n00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.640\nthings that we can do outside of something\nof like an IM and a phone call, as well.\n\n14\n00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.530\nSo Vonne,\n\n15\n00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.800\nwhat is it about sharing desktops and\nWindows that's gonna help us here?\n\n16\n00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.180\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and we're into the topic\nwhere we're going to be collaborating.\n\n17\n00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.502\nWell, we've been collaborating.\n\n18\n00:00:57.502 --> 00:01:00.570\nWell, we've really been\nconducting conversations.\n\n19\n00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.870\nLike, how are we communicating\nwith each other?\n\n20\n00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.160\nWe went through the, like you said, the\nIM, we did our Skype for Business call,\n\n21\n00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.230\nour Skype call, phone calls,\nall those different things, audio calls,\n\n22\n00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.440\nvideo calls.\n\n23\n00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:20.040\nSo this area is where you can do different\nthings in this client, like you said,\n\n24\n00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.425\nthat are specific to Skype for Business,\nto help you collaborate, because,\n\n25\n00:01:25.425 --> 00:01:29.530\nhey, we might be chatting, and maybe just\nIM'ing, we're not even on a phone call or\n\n26\n00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.900\nanything like that, and\nwe're talking about a particular project.\n\n27\n00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.761\nAnd maybe,\nwe're talking about subnetting, right?\n\n28\n00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:38.099\nI know that's one of your\nfavorite subjects, right?\n\n29\n00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.723\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n30\n00:01:38.723 --> 00:01:41.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So with subnetting.\n\n31\n00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.170\nIt's kind of hard to talk about it.\n\n32\n00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.970\nIt's really much easier to draw it or\nshow you.\n\n33\n00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.520\nLet me show you how to do this within\nthe particular interface, and I think\n\n34\n00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.075\nI just got myself into a place I'm like-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n35\n00:01:56.075 --> 00:01:57.244\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember where,\n\n36\n00:01:57.244 --> 00:01:58.850\nwho we talking about subnetting.\n\n37\n00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.820\nBut you need to show me where\nto turn on my network cable.\n\n38\n00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.525\nOkay, you can see why I do Office Pro.\n\n39\n00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:09.750\n[LAUGH] But anyways you need to\ndemonstrate something on your computer,\n\n40\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.780\nand that would be so much easier than you\ntyping it out to tell me the directions.\n\n41\n00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.230\nSo, that's what I was trying to\ngo to of sharing your desktop,\n\n42\n00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.030\nsharing a window, and then more\nwithin this particular topic area.\n\n43\n00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.130\nWe will get into drawing\non the white board.\n\n44\n00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.698\nCuz it's funny, cuz when I start\ndoing subnetting, I'm like, wait.\n\n45\n00:02:28.698 --> 00:02:31.725\nThat's white board where you actually talk\nabout how to do the different classes.\n\n46\n00:02:31.725 --> 00:02:32.789\nI'm like, that's the wrong episode.\n\n47\n00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:36.670\nSo, but we are getting into\nall of those different things,\n\n48\n00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.563\nconducting polls, questions and\nanswers, PowerPoint presentations,\n\n49\n00:02:41.563 --> 00:02:45.150\nso we're gonna talk about\nthe sharing of the desktop.\n\n50\n00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.600\nNow, the way you do it is when\nyou're in a conversation,\n\n51\n00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.340\nit doesn't matter if it's an IM video or\nan audio call, you can go ahead and\n\n52\n00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.060\nclick on this button, and\nthen you start that collaboration process.\n\n53\n00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.810\nSo why don't we go ahead and jump down\nin here and get that party started.\n\n54\n00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.080\nI am going to- We're gonna talk to you,\nRonnie.\n\n55\n00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.346\nRonnie as Ronnie, today.\n\n56\n00:03:07.346 --> 00:03:08.603\nYou're not gonna be Joey.\n\n57\n00:03:08.603 --> 00:03:12.850\nAnd we're gonna keep it\nbasic with just an IM.\n\n58\n00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.511\nIt's opened up in full screen mode for\nsome reason.\n\n59\n00:03:14.511 --> 00:03:17.604\nThat's okay, I'm just gonna grab\nthe title bar down here, and\n\n60\n00:03:17.604 --> 00:03:19.850\nthen just go ahead and,\nwell, you know what?\n\n61\n00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.390\nI'm gonna go ahead, and\nthen just resize my window, all right?\n\n62\n00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.309\nIf one doesn't work,\nwe'll use the other one.\n\n63\n00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:26.240\n[LAUGH] So I've got this here.\n\n64\n00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.830\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and chat.\n\n65\n00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.950\nAnd I'll just start a chat really quickly\nwith him, to get the conversation started.\n\n66\n00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.440\nYou can see right now, this button, just\nto let you know right now, it's not blue.\n\n67\n00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.639\nThat's because we haven't really\nestablished a communication just yet.\n\n68\n00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.343\nSo in case you're like,\nwhy isn't that working just right now?\n\n69\n00:03:49.343 --> 00:03:53.000\nIt will turn on,\nonce you get the ball rolling.\n\n70\n00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.780\nAnd once you go ahead and\nstart saying hello to each other.\n\n71\n00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.985\nAnd you can see,\nthere you go, right on cue.\n\n72\n00:03:57.985 --> 00:03:59.970\n[LAUGH] It went ahead and said, hello.\n\n73\n00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.800\nThere you go.\n\n74\n00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.485\nAnd now my little button down at\nthe bottom is going to be available to us,\n\n75\n00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:08.470\nbecause that's where we're going\nto go to share our content.\n\n76\n00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.183\nSo, I'm going to click on here, and\n\n77\n00:04:11.183 --> 00:04:15.041\nnotice we have share your desktop or\nshare a window.\n\n78\n00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:18.833\nNow, there's a lot of things that I have\nin this particular button of the different\n\n79\n00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:20.200\ncontents that I could share.\n\n80\n00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.540\nLike I mentioned, the Powerpoint and\nthe notes and the co-authoring and\n\n81\n00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.220\nall those things we will cover.\n\n82\n00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.390\nI'm going to take a quick moment to\nlet you know that sharing your desktop\n\n83\n00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.750\nis one of- sharing your desktop and\nyour window are the two things that\n\n84\n00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.790\nyour person you're chatting with, if\nthey're on a Mac, they're using Skype for\n\n85\n00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.630\nBusiness on a Macintosh computer,\nthey will be able to see this.\n\n86\n00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.690\nEverything else, they won't.\n\n87\n00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.020\nThey can't see Powerpoint presentations,\nthey can't see the OneNote,\n\n88\n00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.050\nthey can't see all these other fancy\nstuff, so just keep that in mind\n\n89\n00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.520\nas we go through this entire section or\nthis topic of collaborating.\n\n90\n00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.400\nYou need to think about\nwho's on the other end.\n\n91\n00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.660\nYes, this is Skype for Business on a PC,\n\n92\n00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.095\nand you're on a PC as well,\neven though we're still on Macs,\n\n93\n00:05:07.095 --> 00:05:11.000\n[LAUGH] but just keep that in mind\nwhen you're doing these things.\n\n94\n00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.060\nSo I'm going to say, hey Ronnie,\nI need to show you things on my desktop.\n\n95\n00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.290\nSo I'm gonna click on this button,\nand it's gonna bring up, hey,\n\n96\n00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.960\nguess what people, they're gonna\nsee everything on your monitor.\n\n97\n00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.160\nSo you better be careful, and\n\n98\n00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.080\nmake sure you hide anything\nyou don't want people to see.\n\n99\n00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.080\nIt's nice that they gave you this.\n\n100\n00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.630\nI've never turned this do not show again,\nbecause well, one,\n\n101\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.570\nI'm teaching this product, so I wanna make\nsure that you guys see this every time.\n\n102\n00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.150\nAnother thing is,\nit's kind of a reminder to myself.\n\n103\n00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.290\nLike make sure you don't\nwanna have people see things.\n\n104\n00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.380\nSo if I click OK, now notice,\na few things happen.\n\n105\n00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.020\nThe yellow box goes all\nthe way around my monitors,\n\n106\n00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.120\nbecause I am, well, sharing my monitor.\n\n107\n00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.030\nThe other thing to think about is that\nwhatever's on your screen right now,\n\n108\n00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.010\nthey're seeing.\n\n109\n00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.600\nSo they're actually seeing\nthis big chat window.\n\n110\n00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.080\nAnd it's like, all right.\n\n111\n00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.330\nSo if you are going to be chatting,\nwhile sharing your desktop,\n\n112\n00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.240\nyou might want to consider\nmoving this over,\n\n113\n00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.020\nkind of put this off to the side,\nmaybe minimize your whole Skype client.\n\n114\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.090\nJust be cognizant of\nwhatever's on your monitor,\n\n115\n00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.310\nthe whole desktop, they're gonna see it.\n\n116\n00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.700\nSo kind of push this off.\n\n117\n00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.410\nYou could always minimize and\nmaximize this when you need to.\n\n118\n00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.210\nAnd so on and so forth.\n\n119\n00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.610\nSo now, yes, Ronnie is seeing my desktop.\n\n120\n00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.192\nThe thing that kinda got me is,\nokay, well, wait,\n\n121\n00:06:39.192 --> 00:06:41.152\nwhere did that stop sharing button go?\n\n122\n00:06:41.152 --> 00:06:44.230\nAnd some other things that\npopped up immediately.\n\n123\n00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.040\nThere's a,\nI think they call it a share bar,\n\n124\n00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.330\nat least that's what I'm gonna call it.\n\n125\n00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.155\nThis little guy that comes up at\nthe top of my monitor that will\n\n126\n00:06:52.155 --> 00:06:56.420\nauto-hide as soon as you\nstart kinda moving around.\n\n127\n00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.395\nWhich I can see why,\n\n128\n00:06:57.395 --> 00:07:00.610\ncuz you want people to not have to see\nall of your controls and everything.\n\n129\n00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.150\nSo there's a good reason of why\nyou'd want that to auto hide.\n\n130\n00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.610\nBut for this episode,\nI wanna keep this on, so\n\n131\n00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.920\nyou guys can see it as we go through.\n\n132\n00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.450\nSo over towards the right-hand side,\nthere's this little pin\n\n133\n00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.670\nbutton that looks like it has an x\nthrough it right now or a slash.\n\n134\n00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.960\nIt's cuz it's not pinned.\n\n135\n00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.170\nSo we're going to click this, and now the\nlittle pushpin has turned on to keep this\n\n136\n00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.810\nbar across the top,\nas I go through the different things.\n\n137\n00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.690\nSo everything that I'm doing,\nRonnie is seeing.\n\n138\n00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.500\nAnd we'll switch roles in a little bit,\nto show you what it would be for\n\n139\n00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.650\nme being on the receiving end\nof somebody sharing with me.\n\n140\n00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:45.340\nAnd as I say that, there is one thing\nthat if you have two monitors, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.380\nSay you're gonna go ahead and\nshare your desktop.\n\n142\n00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.060\nBefore you go ahead an click\nthe share your desktop,\n\n143\n00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.840\nit'll give you a little window of\nwhich desktop do you want to show.\n\n144\n00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.570\nDo you want your primary, or one,\ntwo, three, however many monitors.\n\n145\n00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:04.700\nSo you can pick The monitor that you want\nthem to see before you start sharing it.\n\n146\n00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.300\nSo and I had a screenshot.\n\n147\n00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.988\nI honestly don't know where I put it,\nRonnie, so.\n\n148\n00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:09.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know,\n\n149\n00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.510\nit was one of those like\njust take my word for it.\n\n150\n00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.700\nIt's pretty simple.\n\n151\n00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.394\nIt's very, it's pretty self-explanatory.\n\n152\n00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.560\nSo everything that I'm doing here\nRonnie is seeing me move all of that\n\n153\n00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.700\nwonderful things.\n\n154\n00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.250\nNow, the other thing that's kind\nof cool about using sharing\n\n155\n00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.950\nyour desktop through Skype for\nBusiness is who gets control over this?\n\n156\n00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:34.820\nBecause maybe Ronnie is trying to show\nme how to find my network settings and\n\n157\n00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.100\nhe's chatting or\nagain we could be on the phone.\n\n158\n00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.040\nSo he's like go to the Start button, and\n\n159\n00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:44.380\nI'm going okay, this button,\nno this button, no the Start button.\n\n160\n00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.190\nAnd than I'm like I don't\nknow where that is,\n\n161\n00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.590\nhe can request control of my computer.\n\n162\n00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:56.500\nOr I can give control to him,\n\n163\n00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.210\nto allow me, right here, do you mind\nif I take control of your desktop?\n\n164\n00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.120\nThat sounds fantastic.\n\n165\n00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.810\nI'll show you the request\ncontrol in a little bit.\n\n166\n00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:10.030\nBut right now as me, I'm going to delegate\nthat control up there, the drop-down.\n\n167\n00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.000\nAll you have to do is just click it.\n\n168\n00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.030\nSo if I click on Give Control,\nnow what should happen?\n\n169\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.230\nI think I actually have to click\nthe person's name, don't I?\n\n170\n00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:18.750\nOkay sorry, forgot that one step.\n\n171\n00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:24.240\nI have to tell Ronnie that he can go\nahead and have control of my screen.\n\n172\n00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.990\nAnd notice that Ctrl+Alt+Spacebar\nis your shortcut to\n\n173\n00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.290\ntake away that control at any time.\n\n174\n00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.740\nSo If I click on it,\nnotice up at the top of my status,\n\n175\n00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.250\nit says, Ronnie is in control.\n\n176\n00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.380\nLook, no hands, right,\nand things are happening.\n\n177\n00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:45.120\nIt's cuz Ronnie has taken over, and he's\nshowing me how to get to the start menu,\n\n178\n00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.170\nand then he's using my search\nright now to open up, Notepad.\n\n179\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.000\nHe's doing all of this.\n\n180\n00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.560\nThat's pretty neat, especially for\ntech support and everything.\n\n181\n00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.740\nJust jump on a Skype call, go ahead and\nshare your screen out, and\n\n182\n00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.350\nthen there we go.\n\n183\n00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.370\nIt's found in the lower left hand corner.\n\n184\n00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.080\nOkay, that's where the start menu is.\n\n185\n00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.390\nOkay.\nWonderful.\n\n186\n00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.500\nThank you so much.\n\n187\n00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.445\nNow, right there, guess what happened?\n\n188\n00:10:08.445 --> 00:10:11.180\n[COUGH].\nThat's something you need to know about\n\n189\n00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.500\nis that when you give control, and\n\n190\n00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.060\nyou have that status bar up there, they're\ngoing to be able to stop that control.\n\n191\n00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.620\nAnd that's something you\nmight want to think about.\n\n192\n00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.610\n&gt;&gt; All right, Von, that's a great point.\n\n193\n00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:26.970\nI accidentally hit that button thinking\nit was a button on my side and\n\n194\n00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.500\nnot through the actual window\nitself on Von's computer.\n\n195\n00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:35.770\nSo, it can happen so you may want to think\nabout whether you really want to pin that\n\n196\n00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:38.620\nbar across the top or not.\n\n197\n00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.480\nAnd, at that point, if you do,\nyou'll end up seeing nothing and\n\n198\n00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.930\nat this point I have to re-request control\nVon will have to give me control again and\n\n199\n00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.640\nwe have to start the same procedure over.\n\n200\n00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I have to start showing\nyou my desktop all over again.\n\n201\n00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.590\nA lot of times,\nwhen you're going to be collaborating.\n\n202\n00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.017\nWell, hopefully you're collaborating\nwith people that you know and you trust.\n\n203\n00:10:56.017 --> 00:10:58.820\n[LAUGH] And that they're not going\nto do those types of things.\n\n204\n00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.270\nBut it is a really good point to notice\nthat they have full control over your\n\n205\n00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.920\ncomputer and your Skype conversation.\n\n206\n00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.760\nSo why don't we go ahead and\nstart this again?\n\n207\n00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.750\nBecause I did wanna go ahead and\n\n208\n00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:14.780\ngive a few other examples that I am going\nto share my desktop with Ronnie again.\n\n209\n00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.180\nCuz we're still chatting,\nwe still have our conversation open.\n\n210\n00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.310\nSo I click OK.\n\n211\n00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:22.100\nThis is a nice one too.\n\n212\n00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.540\nIt's saying connecting.\n\n213\n00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.220\nRight?\n\n214\n00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.110\nSo that was one thing, and Ronnie let me\nknow, did you get something on your chat\n\n215\n00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:32.420\nthat said content is being shared and\nyou had a click button to allow it?\n\n216\n00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.330\n&gt;&gt; I believe so.\n\n217\n00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:33.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n218\n00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.580\nAnd other things that we do,\nthings kind of automatically, but\n\n219\n00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:40.140\nif you had a chat opened and for\na long time, and you've been talking.\n\n220\n00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.230\nCuz a lot of times I'll just\nkeep them open and just wait for\n\n221\n00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.530\nsomebody to IM me again.\n\n222\n00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.610\nWhat happened is that it got idle for\na little while.\n\n223\n00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:53.500\nAnd so when I went to share\nthe content out it basically asks,\n\n224\n00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.270\nRonnie, like,\nhey somebody's sharing content.\n\n225\n00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.920\nDo you want to allow this to happen?\n\n226\n00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.410\nSo if you ever see that across the bottom\nwhen you are on the receiving end if\n\n227\n00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.260\nsomebody is sharing with you,\njust know that's just part of the process.\n\n228\n00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.440\nSo now we're connected together and\nI've got this up here.\n\n229\n00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.970\nI am gonna pin this so that we can see it.\n\n230\n00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:14.010\nSo I told you about like giving\nthe control and so then I can also like\n\n231\n00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:17.250\nI can give control automatically I'm\nnot sure if I'd want to do that.\n\n232\n00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.460\nI'd want to pick one I\nwanted to give the control.\n\n233\n00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:24.630\nSo Ronnie, I'm gonna give the control back\nto you so you can see once I click okay.\n\n234\n00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.850\nSo now, Ronnie, and just move\nyour mouse around a little bit so\n\n235\n00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.550\nyou can see it kinda going around and\nthings like that.\n\n236\n00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:37.160\nSo now, if I'm, okay, I don't want to\nlet Ronnie have the control anymore.\n\n237\n00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.500\nI can go ahead and take it back.\n\n238\n00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.460\nSo, I want to take back control, and\n\n239\n00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.420\nall this is happening on the other end and\nRonnie's getting little messages,\n\n240\n00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.188\nlike, okay, you're not in control\nanymore and so on and so forth.\n\n241\n00:12:48.188 --> 00:12:53.362\nSo these are some ways that I can control\nwhat's happening with your control.\n\n242\n00:12:53.362 --> 00:12:57.400\n[LAUGH] And then there's another one for\nyou, as the end user,\n\n243\n00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.200\ncan request it from me.\n\n244\n00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.540\nSo if you don't mind there should be\na button at the top there, Ronnie.\n\n245\n00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.505\nAnd there you go you\ncan see that Ronnie is\n\n246\n00:13:04.505 --> 00:13:07.765\nrequesting control it does\nturn another color too.\n\n247\n00:13:07.765 --> 00:13:10.400\nSo do I want to let him\ncontrol my computer?\n\n248\n00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.865\nHmm, I'm gonna say no [LAUGH].\n\n249\n00:13:12.865 --> 00:13:15.315\nSo, I'm going to reject him right there.\n\n250\n00:13:15.315 --> 00:13:19.575\nBut you can see that if I said yes it\nwould do the exact same thing over,\n\n251\n00:13:19.575 --> 00:13:25.045\nhe start moving everything around I\ncould then take it back from here and\n\n252\n00:13:25.045 --> 00:13:28.700\nall of those different ways that\nyou can control the collaboration.\n\n253\n00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.380\nSo that is how we can do it.\n\n254\n00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:36.040\nI'm going to stop sharing right now,\nbrings back our conversation.\n\n255\n00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.970\nSo why don't we take\na look at the other end?\n\n256\n00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:46.590\nRonnie is going to share his desktop with\nme and we'll see all the other buttons.\n\n257\n00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:50.810\nCuz there are some other controls\nup there as the recipient\n\n258\n00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:54.380\nrather than the organized roll call.\n\n259\n00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.770\nThere we go,\nlook accept meeting content, and\n\n260\n00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.920\nI believe there is also something\nbehind my head right here\n\n261\n00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.750\nthat says that Ronnie is adding to\nthe presentation that we are doing.\n\n262\n00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.270\nSo I can accept here or there.\n\n263\n00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.190\nI'll click this one.\n\n264\n00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:12.850\nAnd notice that now I'm\nlooking at Ronnie's screen.\n\n265\n00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.400\nAnd this is where it\ncould be a little weird,\n\n266\n00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.250\nbecause this is where the whole\nbox in box like I'm looking at\n\n267\n00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:23.820\nthe conversation that he's\nsharing with his computer.\n\n268\n00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.720\nSo, this is one of those, as the person\nthat is doing the sharing, you\n\n269\n00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.870\nmight wanna be very aware of, I'm gonna\nminimize this chat window right here.\n\n270\n00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:39.710\nSo you could go ahead and see the desktop\nand everything, so that way, there we go.\n\n271\n00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:41.607\nThank you, Ronnie [LAUGH].\n\n272\n00:14:41.607 --> 00:14:44.275\nOkay, now I see his full desktop.\n\n273\n00:14:44.275 --> 00:14:48.150\nThis is another place we should probably\ntalk about connection speeds there\n\n274\n00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.780\nRonnie, shouldn't we?\n\n275\n00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of times you\nmay actually have it where it\n\n276\n00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.340\nyou were going over wireless.\n\n277\n00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:57.410\nThis may not be as smooth or\nas fluid as what we're talking about here.\n\n278\n00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.670\nSo for example, let's see if I\ncan actually make this work.\n\n279\n00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:05.860\nSo, and the connection does take a little\nbit of bandwidth and it did take me just\n\n280\n00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:10.090\na moment there to even type in Notepad\nto try and share it across the screen.\n\n281\n00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.600\nAnd this is me actually it's not that bad.\n\n282\n00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:19.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; This is me typing to share a desktop.\n\n283\n00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.860\n&gt;&gt; And this is actually pretty\nresponsive cuz like, but\n\n284\n00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:23.500\nthe first part-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n285\n00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.800\n&gt;&gt; When you were like going into\nthe search, like I could hear him typing.\n\n286\n00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.845\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But I couldn't see it.\n\n287\n00:15:29.845 --> 00:15:30.350\n&gt;&gt; Um-hm.\n\n288\n00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:31.030\n&gt;&gt; Here.\nSo\n\n289\n00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:35.180\nif you have a pretty poor\nInternet connection, wireless.\n\n290\n00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.760\n&gt;&gt; Wireless is usually a big one, yep.\n\n291\n00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe're connected like through Ethernet.\n\n292\n00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.690\nHere with our network.\n\n293\n00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.980\nSo we're gonna have like the top\nspeeds right now as we can get.\n\n294\n00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.690\nBut those things will affect what\nyou can see, like the quality.\n\n295\n00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:53.020\nI've done this on my old laptop, trying to\ntest this out, and it looked pretty bad.\n\n296\n00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.354\nIt was very pixellated,\nit was really blurry.\n\n297\n00:15:56.354 --> 00:16:00.828\nSo it's just something to think about\nwhen you're doing these types of\n\n298\n00:16:00.828 --> 00:16:04.570\ncollaborations is that speed\ndoes make a difference here.\n\n299\n00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:07.998\nNow on this end, notice I have\na couple different buttons up here,\n\n300\n00:16:07.998 --> 00:16:11.890\nthere was that request control\nthat Ronnie had done for me.\n\n301\n00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.008\nSo, I could click that button.\n\n302\n00:16:14.008 --> 00:16:18.039\nThe only ones I wanna show you here\nare the actual size, when I click on that\n\n303\n00:16:18.039 --> 00:16:22.527\nthis is just, look, it's actually much\nclearer now because this is like the,\n\n304\n00:16:22.527 --> 00:16:26.460\nI think it's like the one to one\nresolution of that person's monitor.\n\n305\n00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.740\nBut now I can't really\nsee much on his desktop.\n\n306\n00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.490\nSo the Fit To Window is\njust trying to adjust\n\n307\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:36.130\nscreen resolutions into this resolution,\nall those things.\n\n308\n00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:40.020\nSo that's something if you\nwanted to focus in on, and\n\n309\n00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.710\nthen notice I have some scrolls\nover here that I can move around\n\n310\n00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:50.270\nthe share window to see it\nin a clear one to one ratio.\n\n311\n00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:51.680\nSo those are those buttons right there.\n\n312\n00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.603\nSome other things that you have on this\nend Is maybe I don't really want to see\n\n313\n00:16:57.603 --> 00:17:02.106\nall the chat and everything like that,\nyou can go into full screen mode.\n\n314\n00:17:02.106 --> 00:17:05.500\nNow full screen mode is a couple of\ndifferent places, you can click on this\n\n315\n00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.619\nbutton right here up at the top where\nit goes to full screen mode, and\n\n316\n00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:10.500\nwe'll do that, and there you go.\n\n317\n00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:15.543\nSo now the thing that, this kind of\nblack bar across the top, if I move my\n\n318\n00:17:15.543 --> 00:17:20.944\nmouse down, it will auto hide itself\nto just focus on what Ronnie's doing.\n\n319\n00:17:20.944 --> 00:17:25.648\nCuz maybe he's gonna move the window\naround or start something else or\n\n320\n00:17:25.648 --> 00:17:27.421\nsay something else to me.\n\n321\n00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:33.621\n[LAUGH] [SOUND], so, we can go ahead and\ntype in anything, or do whatever.\n\n322\n00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:36.460\nMake him really focus on his screen.\n\n323\n00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.680\nBut now maybe I wanna\nsay something to him.\n\n324\n00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.743\nI wanna chat and\nthen if I hover my mouse up,\n\n325\n00:17:41.743 --> 00:17:47.288\nnotice I just moved my mouse up into\nthat area, it pulls those controls down.\n\n326\n00:17:47.288 --> 00:17:52.096\nAnd then that top right hand\nbutton over on the side,\n\n327\n00:17:52.096 --> 00:17:56.795\nI can exit the full screen mode and\nthen I can chat and\n\n328\n00:17:56.795 --> 00:17:59.770\nit'll be like, this is great.\n\n329\n00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.710\nAnd he can go ahead and notice on his\nscreen it's pulling up and everything.\n\n330\n00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.290\nSo just be aware of like that kind of\npicture in a picture in a picture can\n\n331\n00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.150\nbe a little confusing at times.\n\n332\n00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:10.880\nBut just be aware of it.\n\n333\n00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.960\nThe other thing about full screen mode,\nand I think we talked about this on some\n\n334\n00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.770\nother episodes,\nis any conversation that you have.\n\n335\n00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.850\nYou can get in the full-screen\nmode by like double clicking on\n\n336\n00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:23.420\nlike whatever is in the main box.\n\n337\n00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.000\nSo if I double click here,\nnotice it takes me into full-screen mode.\n\n338\n00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.080\nIf I double click again,\nit's gonna take me out of it.\n\n339\n00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.985\nSo it's a quick way to come in and\nout of full-screen mode in any of your\n\n340\n00:18:33.985 --> 00:18:39.060\nconversations or in this case\ncollaborations with the desktop.\n\n341\n00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.140\n&gt;&gt; Vonne I just saw something on\nmy screen that also matched yours.\n\n342\n00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:45.659\nWhich is I now have this border around\nthe edge of my entire screen and\n\n343\n00:18:45.659 --> 00:18:48.828\nI'm also seeing it in the window\nthat you're seeing there.\n\n344\n00:18:48.828 --> 00:18:50.736\nThat kind of yellowish or gold or\n\n345\n00:18:50.736 --> 00:18:55.960\norange-ish border as well that shows me\nat least visually that I'm sharing it.\n\n346\n00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.980\nAnd the person on the other end is sharing\nit, so it's a good visual indicator.\n\n347\n00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.430\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n348\n00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.128\nAnd that's funny,\nbecause I'm glad you pointed it out.\n\n349\n00:19:02.128 --> 00:19:05.466\nBecause yeah, I do see that [LAUGH].\n\n350\n00:19:05.466 --> 00:19:07.836\nI couldn't remember that you did.\n\n351\n00:19:07.836 --> 00:19:11.200\nAll right, so the request control,\nI can go ahead and click on this.\n\n352\n00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.381\nAnd so, well,\nactually allow me control, Ryan, so\n\n353\n00:19:13.381 --> 00:19:14.936\nwe can see what it looks like on my end.\n\n354\n00:19:14.936 --> 00:19:16.312\n&gt;&gt; Sure, why not.\n\n355\n00:19:16.312 --> 00:19:17.930\n&gt;&gt; Why not.\n\n356\n00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:22.470\nAll right, so now you can see that\non my end it says release control.\n\n357\n00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:26.540\nSo I can come in here and\nI can start moving things around.\n\n358\n00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.280\nNow this is where, okay,\nyou've gotta be kind of careful.\n\n359\n00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.570\nAnd that's probably like I didn't\nreally mean to click on that button.\n\n360\n00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:39.317\nAnd I can come down into here and\nI can type in Edge, right?\n\n361\n00:19:39.317 --> 00:19:40.110\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n362\n00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:44.804\n&gt;&gt; So there we go, cuz maybe I wanna\ngo ahead and start your browser up.\n\n363\n00:19:44.804 --> 00:19:49.851\nBut you got to be very kind of, you got to\nbe patient, you got to kind of let your\n\n364\n00:19:49.851 --> 00:19:54.620\nmouth, your mouse move to different\nplaces, maybe I wanna close that.\n\n365\n00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.500\nAgain, we're on a really\nstrong connection, so\n\n366\n00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.090\nour response time is pretty quick.\n\n367\n00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.970\nBut know, Marisha and I tested this out.\n\n368\n00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:06.014\nAnd Marisha was like,\nthis is just like, it's too slow.\n\n369\n00:20:06.014 --> 00:20:10.014\nThere's so much lag that I was\nactually a detriment to her and\n\n370\n00:20:10.014 --> 00:20:14.100\nhow we were supposed to be\ncommunicating and collaborating.\n\n371\n00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.710\nShe was really just testing with me,\nbut she's like,\n\n372\n00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:22.575\nif I was on a real meeting with this,\nshe goes, this would be More annoying\n\n373\n00:20:22.575 --> 00:20:27.538\n[LAUGH] than helpful, so just be aware\nof those things, it's always nice.\n\n374\n00:20:27.538 --> 00:20:31.174\nNow I'll release the control, now as\nit says, you no longer have control.\n\n375\n00:20:31.174 --> 00:20:34.674\n[LAUGH] Sounds like the story of\nmy life sometimes, so [LAUGH].\n\n376\n00:20:34.674 --> 00:20:37.646\nYou can see all the different\noptions that we have here\n\n377\n00:20:37.646 --> 00:20:41.380\non the receiving end of having\nsomething being shared with.\n\n378\n00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:46.440\nI can't stop the sharing,\nso I just can't do that.\n\n379\n00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.680\nBut he can, and that's a nice thing.\n\n380\n00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.530\nI do like that we did this part right\nhere, is that he stopped sharing but\n\n381\n00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.570\nI still see this stage, they call it.\n\n382\n00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:58.180\nWhere they're staging all the material.\n\n383\n00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.150\nWell, I don't wanna really see that,\nand I can still keep chatting.\n\n384\n00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.660\nWe can keep talking, but\nI don't want that anymore.\n\n385\n00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:08.324\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and just, sorry,\nI keep doing that, hide the stage.\n\n386\n00:21:08.324 --> 00:21:14.487\nAnd then it just goes back to a normal\nchat window, so that's something to do.\n\n387\n00:21:14.487 --> 00:21:19.400\nHere, I'm just gonna share my screen\nwith you one more time just to\n\n388\n00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.990\ngive you all a quick little tip\nthat kind of threw me off, too.\n\n389\n00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:29.323\nIs that I,\nsee where it says Show Stage right there?\n\n390\n00:21:29.323 --> 00:21:32.450\nAnd this could be on either end,\nwhether I'm sharing or not sharing.\n\n391\n00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:35.520\nBut I hit it once and I couldn't find it.\n\n392\n00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.290\nI think it's on the receiving end\nlike I was the one being shared.\n\n393\n00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.938\nAnd I clicked this button\ndown at the bottom.\n\n394\n00:21:40.938 --> 00:21:43.080\nNotice it says Hide Stage right now.\n\n395\n00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.900\nAnd so maybe, Ronnie,\nyou'll see that we're talking about.\n\n396\n00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.970\nAnd then it's like, whoa, wait.\n\n397\n00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.600\nI, where did the person's screen go?\n\n398\n00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.823\nSo just in case your stage\ngoes away on either end,\n\n399\n00:21:52.823 --> 00:21:55.550\nit can be a little weird on that.\n\n400\n00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:58.922\nSo, and that's also another thing of\nwhere, if you didn't want people to see\n\n401\n00:21:58.922 --> 00:22:01.954\nthat kind of picture and picture and\npicture, you could hide it down.\n\n402\n00:22:01.954 --> 00:22:06.864\nBut it does live back in this little\nbutton as you share out your different\n\n403\n00:22:06.864 --> 00:22:07.600\ncontent.\n\n404\n00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:12.040\nSo I'm going to come back into here,\nno I'm going to come up here and I'm\n\n405\n00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.210\ngoing to stop sharing with you, because I\nwas the one that shared with you, Ronnie.\n\n406\n00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.630\nSo I will stop that and\nback into our regular chat.\n\n407\n00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:24.840\nNow, everything that we just did,\nyou can do with just a single window.\n\n408\n00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.530\nMaybe I don't want them\nseeing my whole desktop.\n\n409\n00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:31.730\nMaybe I'll pull up Notepad again and\nbring this up.\n\n410\n00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:35.120\nAnd this is the only thing\nI want Ronnie to see.\n\n411\n00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.110\nI do not want him to see all my\nother things on my computer.\n\n412\n00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:45.000\nSo I can share out just one window for\nhim.\n\n413\n00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:49.400\nIn our chat, if I come back over here,\nshare a window,\n\n414\n00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.580\nit's gonna ask me for\nwhich application do I want to share.\n\n415\n00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.524\nSo if I had Internet Explorer,\nmaybe Word, Excel,\n\n416\n00:22:59.524 --> 00:23:02.583\nany application opened on my computer.\n\n417\n00:23:02.583 --> 00:23:04.380\nIt's gonna ask me which one to do it.\n\n418\n00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.270\nI only have one right now,\njust to make it a little easier.\n\n419\n00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.610\nSo you click the one that you want,\nyou get the little blue box around it.\n\n420\n00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:14.200\nNotice that when I didn't click on it,\nthe share doesn't populate.\n\n421\n00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.620\nSo you gotta make sure you click on that.\n\n422\n00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.920\nClick Share, and it does say,\n\n423\n00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.900\nhey, everyone's gonna see\nthe program you opened.\n\n424\n00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.640\nBut it does say something about Windows 8.\n\n425\n00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.207\nAnd it says that you might actually\nstill be able to see your desktop, so\n\n426\n00:23:26.207 --> 00:23:30.140\njust in case you're on Windows 8,\nnice little FYI there.\n\n427\n00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:34.790\nClick OK, and now let me go ahead and\nmove this over.\n\n428\n00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:36.520\nSorry, ooh, come here, there it is.\n\n429\n00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:40.110\nCome on, there, you can do it [LAUGH].\n\n430\n00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:44.740\nSo now you can see that it's got that\nsame share orange bar a little bit.\n\n431\n00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.591\nIt's a little bit more orange than yellow.\n\n432\n00:23:46.591 --> 00:23:48.179\nI thought it was a little\nbit more yellow last time.\n\n433\n00:23:48.179 --> 00:23:50.410\nSo you can see right here\nthat I am sharing it.\n\n434\n00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:52.859\nI still have the same sharing options.\n\n435\n00:23:52.859 --> 00:23:56.266\nI can give control He can request control,\nso\n\n436\n00:23:56.266 --> 00:24:01.200\neverything's the same way that\nwe have in sharing your desktop,\n\n437\n00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.000\nit's just what they can see and\nwhat they can't see.\n\n438\n00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.950\nOne thing to notice though,\nif I brought in,\n\n439\n00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:14.610\nlet's say like this chat or anything, you\nsee a big black box in that area, right?\n\n440\n00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:15.230\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n441\n00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:21.360\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so he is seeing anything that\nyou overlap in this sharing area.\n\n442\n00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.170\nIt doesn't actually show up.\n\n443\n00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:25.450\nIt just shows us black area.\n\n444\n00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:26.470\nSo why don't we do this?\n\n445\n00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:27.881\nI'm gonna stop sharing.\n\n446\n00:24:27.881 --> 00:24:30.564\nAnd Ronnie, just so\nthey can see the end result,\n\n447\n00:24:30.564 --> 00:24:33.260\nwhy don't you share a notepad with me,\nplease.\n\n448\n00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.140\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n449\n00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:39.026\n&gt;&gt; All right, and I will eagerly\n\n450\n00:24:39.026 --> 00:24:44.506\nawait your share request [LAUGH].\n\n451\n00:24:44.506 --> 00:24:49.070\nThere we go, so\nnow I am sharing, he is typing.\n\n452\n00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:55.310\nI can see everything and he'll move\nsomething else into that area so\n\n453\n00:24:55.310 --> 00:25:00.460\nyou guys can see the Black box,\ngoodness, there it goes.\n\n454\n00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:04.700\n[LAUGH] So yeah, see he's moving\nthe chat window right in there.\n\n455\n00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.040\nSo I don't see and\nthat's a nice thing to know is that,\n\n456\n00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.410\nthey're not seeing\nthe content of that window.\n\n457\n00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:18.300\nThey're just seeing it black cuz you've\nonly said to share out the window.\n\n458\n00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.260\nNot the whole space.\n\n459\n00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.470\nSo in case you ever see that,\njust maybe chat over and be like,\n\n460\n00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.720\nhey can you move that other\nthing out of the way?\n\n461\n00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.110\nI can't see things and so on, so forth.\n\n462\n00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.770\nAnd that's one way that we\ncan go ahead and do that.\n\n463\n00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:35.776\nSo I believe that is everything\nthat I wanted to descri-.\n\n464\n00:25:35.776 --> 00:25:40.280\nThere is one small little thing,\nlet me go ahead and I'll show you guys.\n\n465\n00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.800\nIn case you get a notification\nas you see down here,\n\n466\n00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.090\nit says, Ronnie wants to start sharing.\n\n467\n00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.955\nWait, what?\n\n468\n00:25:47.955 --> 00:25:51.960\n[LAUGH] This is just one of those things\nthat's gonna pop up and I just ignored it.\n\n469\n00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:57.100\nSo he's gonna get an ignore message from\nme that says, You know it didn't happen.\n\n470\n00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.290\nThe call didn't happen.\n\n471\n00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:03.710\nWhat happened there is he went ahead and\nstarted a chat with me.\n\n472\n00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:07.600\nBut he started sharing right away.\n\n473\n00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:12.780\nHe went ahead and maybe opened up\na white board or shared his desktop\n\n474\n00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:18.230\nwith me before he even sent the first chat\nor the first like hey how's it going.\n\n475\n00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:23.190\nSo I get a notification if there's, I\ndon't know what he wants to share with me.\n\n476\n00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:26.510\nSo it might deter people\nfrom clicking on that,\n\n477\n00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:29.810\nespecially if it's somebody you\ndon't talk to a lot of times.\n\n478\n00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:33.970\nTo where it's like hmm, and hopefully\nwith our end user security in mind,\n\n479\n00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.380\nyou don't want to accept things\nfrom people you don't know.\n\n480\n00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:41.570\nOr accept a sharing request or\nanything that You might not understand, so\n\n481\n00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.090\njust be aware that you\nmight want to go ahead and\n\n482\n00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:46.570\nestablish a conversation first,\nin a sense.\n\n483\n00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:49.530\nHey, chat, video call, or audio call.\n\n484\n00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.990\nHey, I'm gonna stream my screen, okay?\n\n485\n00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:55.770\nGreat, so\nestablish the conversation first.\n\n486\n00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:59.040\nAnd then go ahead and share your content\nout because sometimes that little\n\n487\n00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.130\nnotification might scare people off.\n\n488\n00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.060\nSo I just wanted to show you that.\n\n489\n00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.340\n&gt;&gt; Good etiquette,\nmore than anything else here.\n\n490\n00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.038\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n491\n00:27:06.038 --> 00:27:08.100\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne,\nwell, thank you again for\n\n492\n00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.270\nhelping us to understand a little bit more\nabout sharing our desktop or a window.\n\n493\n00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.250\nTo help us during those times of\ncollaboration when we need to,\n\n494\n00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:19.120\nor demonstrate something to anybody\nthat's actually watching or\n\n495\n00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.860\nwho we choose to as well.\n\n496\n00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:24.850\nThis is a great feature that can help us\nto make our collaborations a lot more\n\n497\n00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:27.740\neffective instead of just trying\nto talk everybody through it or\n\n498\n00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.240\ntype in everything that\nsomebody needs to know.\n\n499\n00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.940\nWell, this is a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n500\n00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:38.088\nSigning off our Office ProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n501\n00:27:38.088 --> 00:27:39.190\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n502\n00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.370\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Skype for Business shows.\n\n",

Well, thank you for having me, I feel\nglowing right now, thank you, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:33.674\n&gt;&gt; That is because you are glowing, Vonne.\n\n13\n00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:35.283\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So here it is,\n\n14\n00:00:35.283 --> 00:00:39.241\nwe've already taken a look a lot in our\nseries so far, in Skype for Business.\n\n15\n00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:42.146\nWe've talked about instant messaging and,\nof course,\n\n16\n00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:44.211\nthe audio calls that we've been doing.\n\n17\n00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:49.037\nAll of these are good utilities, and most\nof us are fairly familiar with doing that.\n\n18\n00:00:49.037 --> 00:00:53.729\nBut we probably didn't even know that this\ntool existed in Skype for Business if we\n\n19\n00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.608\nhaven't done anything besides IM or\nusing an audio call like that.\n\n20\n00:00:57.608 --> 00:01:01.634\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the other thing about\nthe Whiteboard, it's kind of hidden,\n\n21\n00:01:01.634 --> 00:01:04.210\nit's in the More button\nin the Share Content.\n\n22\n00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.944\nAnd so if, like you're saying,\nif all you've really ever done is chat,\n\n23\n00:01:07.944 --> 00:01:09.765\nyou might not have even found this.\n\n24\n00:01:09.765 --> 00:01:13.892\nAnd we are in the collaboration,\nor the collaborate topic area,\n\n25\n00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:16.526\nwhere we're sharing different things.\n\n26\n00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:19.745\nAnd so sharing and\nusing a Whiteboard is part of that.\n\n27\n00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:24.648\nBecause sometimes you need to get your\npoint across a little bit better than just\n\n28\n00:01:24.648 --> 00:01:27.077\ntalking about it or chatting about it.\n\n29\n00:01:27.077 --> 00:01:30.518\nAnd I know as instructors\nwe tend to always,\n\n30\n00:01:30.518 --> 00:01:34.798\nlike when we're talking to\neach other in a classroom.\n\n31\n00:01:34.798 --> 00:01:38.191\nLet me come over to the whiteboard and\nactually draw it out.\n\n32\n00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:42.334\nBecause it's kind of the way we\ncommunicate as educators is,\n\n33\n00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:46.170\nI need to draw a diagram,\nI need to draw a picture for you.\n\n34\n00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.470\nSo we are going to go ahead and do that\nright here within Skype for Business.\n\n35\n00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.398\nNow, the thing to know\nabout when you go ahead and\n\n36\n00:01:53.398 --> 00:01:57.980\nturn on the Whiteboard, even if we\nare going to be in a two way conversation.\n\n37\n00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.790\nLike we're going to demonstrate\nusing the Whiteboard as me and\n\n38\n00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.519\nRonnie, as our other people,\nas our Joey and JT characters.\n\n39\n00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:11.337\nWe're going to just be in a regular\nIM chat, and it's just the two of us.\n\n40\n00:02:11.337 --> 00:02:14.098\nBut as soon as I share out a Whiteboard,\n\n41\n00:02:14.098 --> 00:02:18.550\nit automatically switches that\nconversation into a meeting.\n\n42\n00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.025\nAnd that's where it gets a little like,\nhm, well, I'm just closing it, but\n\n43\n00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:23.615\nit's asking me to end the meeting.\n\n44\n00:02:23.615 --> 00:02:28.183\nWell, cuz technically you're\nin an impromptu meeting.\n\n45\n00:02:28.183 --> 00:02:33.059\nAnd so all of those different\naspects of running a meeting,\n\n46\n00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:38.042\nwhere you talk about changing\nthe status of your attendees.\n\n47\n00:02:38.042 --> 00:02:43.512\nWhether they're a presenter or you demote\nthem down into being just an attendee,\n\n48\n00:02:43.512 --> 00:02:47.171\nall that meeting stuff,\nthose are in other episodes.\n\n49\n00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:49.787\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, this one, we're just concentrating\n\n50\n00:02:49.787 --> 00:02:53.317\non this particular tool, or\nthis collaboration item that you can do.\n\n51\n00:02:53.317 --> 00:02:58.132\nAnd you can put this in an IM\nconversation, a phone call, a Skype for\n\n52\n00:02:58.132 --> 00:03:00.598\nBusiness meeting, any of those.\n\n53\n00:03:00.598 --> 00:03:02.767\nWell, I guess a phone call,\nif you're doing phone to phone,\n\n54\n00:03:02.767 --> 00:03:04.282\nyou can't really use a whiteboard [LAUGH].\n\n55\n00:03:04.282 --> 00:03:08.676\nSo I guess we'll do a Skype\nclient communication.\n\n56\n00:03:08.676 --> 00:03:12.509\nSo just kinda throwing that out there,\nso you know that that's gonna happen.\n\n57\n00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:15.395\nAnd we're going to be kind of attacking,\nif you want to say,\n\n58\n00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:18.297\nthis particular,\nI don't know if attack is the right word.\n\n59\n00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:19.288\nWe're going to address.\n\n60\n00:03:19.288 --> 00:03:19.864\n&gt;&gt; Address.\n\n61\n00:03:19.864 --> 00:03:20.441\n&gt;&gt; How about that?\n\n62\n00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:21.556\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n63\n00:03:21.556 --> 00:03:24.580\nSo, Vonne, what we're trying to\nmake sure that we understand is,\n\n64\n00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.617\nthere are meetings involved, and\nit's easy to get confused here.\n\n65\n00:03:27.617 --> 00:03:31.057\nBut we just want to demonstrate if\nsomebody that wants to just get their\n\n66\n00:03:31.057 --> 00:03:31.826\npoint across.\n\n67\n00:03:31.826 --> 00:03:35.451\nAnd how to get that Whiteboard usage\nacross without dealing with all of\n\n68\n00:03:35.451 --> 00:03:37.795\nthe other meeting aspects\nthat are in there.\n\n69\n00:03:37.795 --> 00:03:40.975\nVonne will get to that, or\nif you've actually been watching the show,\n\n70\n00:03:40.975 --> 00:03:42.734\nshe might have already gotten to that.\n\n71\n00:03:42.734 --> 00:03:45.317\nAnd if you've kind of\nskipped around as well, but\n\n72\n00:03:45.317 --> 00:03:48.836\nmake sure you take a look at that meeting,\nthose meeting episodes.\n\n73\n00:03:48.836 --> 00:03:51.157\nAnd that way,\nyou'll actually be full up on that.\n\n74\n00:03:51.157 --> 00:03:52.915\nSo, Vonne, where are we gonna begin?\n\n75\n00:03:52.915 --> 00:03:55.914\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna start off\nwhere I'm Joey today.\n\n76\n00:03:55.914 --> 00:03:59.099\nSo I decided to switch personalities,\nif you all know me,\n\n77\n00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.790\nI like to do that a lot, [LAUGH].\n\n78\n00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.279\nSo we're gonna jump down\ninto Joey's computer, and\n\n79\n00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:04.893\nhe's already signed in to Skype.\n\n80\n00:04:04.893 --> 00:04:06.852\nWe're going to start\na conversation with Justin.\n\n81\n00:04:06.852 --> 00:04:08.759\nSo, you're gonna be Justin today, Ronnie!\n\n82\n00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:10.199\n&gt;&gt; I am gonna-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n83\n00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.954\n&gt;&gt; Be Justin Timberlake.\n\n84\n00:04:10.954 --> 00:04:12.839\n&gt;&gt; You're so excited, [LAUGH].\n\n85\n00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:13.470\n&gt;&gt;

Descriptive?\n\n335\n00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:47.970\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, [LAUGH] couldn't find\nthe word to describe descriptive.\n\n336\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.970\nSo we can rename this if I would like to.\n\n337\n00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.160\nBut for now,\nI'm just gonna keep it as whiteboard1.\n\n338\n00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.620\nI'm gonna close this.\n\n339\n00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.370\nAnd we do have another episode where we\njust talk about the managing content and\n\n340\n00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:02.560\nhow you kinda preload some of this\ninformation before a meeting.\n\n341\n00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.670\nSo if you want,\nyou can watch that episode.\n\n342\n00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:09.670\nAnd then the other thing that, what if\nI wanted another white board, right?\n\n343\n00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:14.098\nBecause now I'm done demonstrating\nthis bunny right here.\n\n344\n00:18:14.098 --> 00:18:17.990\n[LAUGH] If I come back\ninto the More button.\n\n345\n00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.100\nWell, first Share Content\nthen More button.\n\n346\n00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.730\nAnd I choose Whiteboard, notice it\ngoes ahead and starts another one, so\n\n347\n00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.460\nnow I'm in Whiteboard2.\n\n348\n00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.598\nSo if I said, second whiteboard,\n\n349\n00:18:29.598 --> 00:18:35.240\nwhere do you think we're\ngonna find the first one?\n\n350\n00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.240\nManage content.\n\n351\n00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.605\nSo if I come back down here all that\ninformation is, it didn't go away.\n\n352\n00:18:39.605 --> 00:18:42.800\nWhiteboard1 is still here, come back in.\n\n353\n00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.330\nI want to switch back over\nto the other white board.\n\n354\n00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:49.260\nI can click on this and I can start\nsharing this particular content and\n\n355\n00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.170\ngo back and forth.\n\n356\n00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.060\nSo I don't want you to think\nthat you are eliminating or\n\n357\n00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.690\ndeleting your other white board.\n\n358\n00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:58.640\nIt's just going into that\nshared background space,\n\n359\n00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.680\nthe queue that I just described\nwhen your content goes there.\n\n360\n00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:08.220\nAll right, so I think that's about\neverything using the whiteboard.\n\n361\n00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:12.340\nSo let's talk about the roles for\na minute because I am the organizer.\n\n362\n00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.255\nJustin, who I almost said Joey,\nno, I'm Joey today.\n\n363\n00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:19.610\n[LAUGH] Justin is a presenter as well.\n\n364\n00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:24.650\nSo maybe he wants to take over and\nhe actually has that button at the top.\n\n365\n00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.240\nAnd so I'd like you to go ahead and\nclick on that.\n\n366\n00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.010\nAnd look at what happens to me as Joey.\n\n367\n00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:34.780\nMine just turns to, instead of stop\nsharing as take over as the presenter.\n\n368\n00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:39.910\nSo we would be like co-presenters,\nbut if you are the main\n\n369\n00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:45.900\npresenter in the whiteboard, you have\nthe option of stopping the sharing.\n\n370\n00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:51.220\nThat's really the biggest difference\nin whether or not you're like he main\n\n371\n00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:56.950\nperson or the second in charge is\nwho can stop the sharing, all right?\n\n372\n00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.600\nAnd that can also be like hey,\n\n373\n00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.300\nyou're going to go ahead and\ndo all the regular stuff.\n\n374\n00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.010\nI can still go ahead and contribute,\n\n375\n00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:08.042\nbut now it's your job to stop he\nsharing and share something else.\n\n376\n00:20:08.042 --> 00:20:11.750\nMay be you need to share the desktop\ncuz he's gonna go ahead and\n\n377\n00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.200\ntake over presenting of the content.\n\n378\n00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.284\nSo I can take that back, and\nthen we have the same button.\n\n379\n00:20:18.284 --> 00:20:22.238\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, the very useful thing about\nusing the ability to change those\n\n380\n00:20:22.238 --> 00:20:25.170\npresenters is if you think\nabout a business case for\n\n381\n00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:29.950\nthis where your multiple department heads,\nbut they are spread all over.\n\n382\n00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:31.980\nAnd they still had to\npresent their reports.\n\n383\n00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.230\nThey can simply at that point say,\nhey Vonne, I'm ready for\n\n384\n00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:36.950\nyou to present your part.\n\n385\n00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:41.470\nAnd then take over as the presenter and\nhave everything ready to go at that point.\n\n386\n00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:44.650\nWithout having to wonder,\ndoes Vonne have to close out and\n\n387\n00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:48.560\nthen we open a whole new meeting for\nVonne presentation.\n\n388\n00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.060\nSo it allows us to do that and\n\n389\n00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.420\nstill keep the functionality that\nwe need that Vonne just showed us.\n\n390\n00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.400\nBut having this ability, right, is\nactually something that is very powerful,\n\n391\n00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.320\nespecially over this communication.\n\n392\n00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.230\nBecause a lot of times,\n\n393\n00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.040\nwe don't think about it like we said\nat the beginning of the episode.\n\n394\n00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.360\nWe think about chatting, we think about\nvoice calls, something like that.\n\n395\n00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.720\nBut we hardly think about\nthe idea of making a presentation\n\n396\n00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.970\nusing something like Skype for\nBusiness, but it is very powerful.\n\n397\n00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.830\nIt gives you at least\nfundamental abilities to do so.\n\n398\n00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.850\nIt would probably work better\nif Vonne had a touchscreen so\n\n399\n00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.440\nthat she could draw better.\n\n400\n00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.740\nBut overall though, you see some\nof the functionality that's there.\n\n401\n00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.190\nSo take advantage of it when\nyou actually need it, and\n\n402\n00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.795\nthat's the key what we\nare trying to show you.\n\n403\n00:21:28.795 --> 00:21:31.525\nAll right, so Vonne,\nwhat else do we think about here.\n\n404\n00:21:31.525 --> 00:21:34.843\n&gt;&gt; The only last part would\nbe when we are done, right?\n\n405\n00:21:34.843 --> 00:21:39.624\nOkay, I am ready to go ahead and stop all\nthis craziness of this bunny, [LAUGH].\n\n406\n00:21:39.624 --> 00:21:41.540\nSo if we come back into my computer.\n\n407\n00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:47.730\nWe can stop the sharing, that's fine, but\nremember like I said, this is a meeting.\n\n408\n00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:51.170\nSo if I try to close this, and\nwhy don't I go ahead and do that?\n\n409\n00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.570\nIf I just close the chat,\ncuz you think we're just each other,\n\n410\n00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:59.520\nit's gonna give you that whole,\nlike hey, do you wanna end the meeting?\n\n411\n00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.120\nAnd this is something that I know we've\n\n412\n00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.790\nprobably alluded to because\nwe used to use Adobe Connect.\n\n413\n00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:05.670\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; All the time and\n\n414\n00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:07.260\nit was like if I'm done,\n\n415\n00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.910\nI have to end because it basically\nkeeps like the session open.\n\n416\n00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:11.870\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n417\n00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.920\nif you don't want people to keep on\ntalking, you should probably go ahead and\n\n418\n00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.510\nend the meeting.\n\n419\n00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.819\nSo that's just my little tidbit.\n\n420\n00:22:17.819 --> 00:22:21.803\nYou'll probably see me saying this\na couple times and other places, but\n\n421\n00:22:21.803 --> 00:22:23.890\nit is a really important fact.\n\n422\n00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:24.840\nSo I'm going to cancel that.\n\n423\n00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.450\nThe end meeting, just as a review, is back\ndown here in the more options button down\n\n424\n00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:31.390\nat the bottom right hand corner,\nand then I can end the meeting.\n\n425\n00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.566\nAnd that way everybody is like,\nthe meeting is done,\n\n426\n00:22:34.566 --> 00:22:38.529\ndoor's closed, go away, and\nI will end the meeting right there.\n\n427\n00:22:38.529 --> 00:22:43.511\nAnd then the last thing I wanted\nto just throw out there is that,\n\n428\n00:22:43.511 --> 00:22:49.550\nif I started a, I'm with you,\nany type of communication or conversation.\n\n429\n00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:54.160\nAnd I started all of that shared\ncontent to begin with, it will show up\n\n430\n00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.020\nto the person you're asking\nas a group conversation.\n\n431\n00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:03.520\nAnd that might be another\nmisleading thing of if you agree,\n\n432\n00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.030\nI thought Joey and\nI were just talking about ourselves.\n\n433\n00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:10.161\nI'm not ready to talk to anybody else and\nI really hope that Chris isn't there or\n\n434\n00:23:10.161 --> 00:23:11.095\nsomething like.\n\n435\n00:23:11.095 --> 00:23:16.281\n[LAUGH] So just always start with\nthe regular communication or\n\n436\n00:23:16.281 --> 00:23:18.520\nconversation first.\n\n437\n00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.710\nTune IM, terming an audio call and\nlike okay hey you ready, let me go and\n\n438\n00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:23.600\nshare up this whiteboard.\n\n439\n00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:29.383\nDon't start all of this stuff before you\nget an answer from the other person.\n\n440\n00:23:29.383 --> 00:23:30.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it can be misleading.\n\n441\n00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:33.820\nI think we talked about that in the shared\ndesktop of where it's, hey, they\n\n442\n00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:38.530\nwanna share something with you, people\nsee that and they get a little scared.\n\n443\n00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:41.020\nI don't wanna talk to\nmore than one person.\n\n444\n00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.370\nI don't wanna go ahead and get this\nshared thing, he's sending me a virus or\n\n445\n00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:45.840\nsomething.\n\n446\n00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.931\nSo just establish your conversation\nfirst and then go ahead and\n\n447\n00:23:49.931 --> 00:23:52.490\nuse your collaboration tools second.\n\n448\n00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.190\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, that's a really good point\nabout the idea of making sure that we make\n\n449\n00:23:57.190 --> 00:24:01.190\ncontact before because most people\nare not going to want to accept.\n\n450\n00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.880\nA message that is just unsolicitated, so\n\n451\n00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.720\nmake sure you show the proper\netiquette and you do that,\n\n452\n00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:11.280\nwhether it's gonna be I am or whether it\nis a phone call to help us to do that.\n\n453\n00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:15.040\nAll right Vonne, thank you again,\nany last words for our viewers?\n\n454\n00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.620\n&gt;&gt; It's actually a pretty big one.\n\n455\n00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So any of these collaboration tool that\n\n456\n00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:25.180\nyou're using within Skype of Business and\na PC cuz that's the show that we're doing.\n\n457\n00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.150\nWe're doing it from the PC angle.\n\n458\n00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:31.560\nWell, we can go ahead and use whiteboards,\nand the PowerPoints, and all that.\n\n459\n00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.910\nBut if you're talking to somebody on\nthe other end that is using the Skype for\n\n460\n00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:38.400\nBusiness client on a Mac.\n\n461\n00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.990\nThey're not gonna be able to see that,\nthey're not gonna see the whiteboard,\n\n462\n00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:42.660\nthey're not gonna be able\nto draw on the white board.\n\n463\n00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:46.210\nDoesn't matter what role they have,\nthis is actually true for\n\n464\n00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:51.750\nalmost all of this tools in\nthe collaborate topic that we have.\n\n465\n00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.230\nThey can't do it.\n\n466\n00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.810\nIt's just not built into\nthat particular client.\n\n467\n00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.860\nThey can do screen shares or\ndesktop sharing.\n\n468\n00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.580\nThey can't do individual windows, okay?\n\n469\n00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:06.030\nAnd I think I actually left that\nout in the share the desktop part,\n\n470\n00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.700\nbut just be very aware of that.\n\n471\n00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:14.140\nThe person on the other end if they don't\nhave a PC a lot of stuff is null and\n\n472\n00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.000\nvoid to them.\n\n473\n00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.160\nSo that's kinda throws a wrench in\nsome of this collaboration tools.\n\n474\n00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.680\nSo just wanna point that up.\n\n475\n00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.000\n&gt;&gt; That's a good thing to\nactually remember with this\n\n476\n00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.200\nidea that we have is not nice to think\nthere's gonna be a spread across the board\n\n477\n00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.330\nregardless of what\nmachine that you are on.\n\n478\n00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.230\nReally all these tools that we are talking\nabout in the detailed Vonne has talked\n\n479\n00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:39.460\nabout, is gonna sent the only work very\nwell inside of a Windows environment.\n\n480\n00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.450\nSo make sure you remember that as well.\n\n481\n00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:44.500\nThat's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n482\n00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.410\nSigning off of OfficePro TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n483\n00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:49.340\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n484\n00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.611\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Skype for Business episodes.\n\n485\n00:25:52.611 --> 00:25:59.850\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.280\nyou are watching the Skype for\nBusiness show.\n\n4\n00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.710\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.470\nAnd today, we're going to be telling you\n\n6\n00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.780\nhow to make sure that you can\nshare your PowerPoint files.\n\n7\n00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.530\nAnd here, of course,\n\n8\n00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.900\nto help us is going to be our OfficePro\nvirtuoso herself, Miss Vaughn Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.855\nVaughn, welcome to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:34.039\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me as always.\n\n11\n00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:37.421\nWe're going to be PowerPointing\nit up today [LAUGH] and\n\n12\n00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:41.781\nshowing how we can collaborate\nusing A PowerPoint presentation, so\n\n13\n00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:46.592\nanother way of being able to show your\nconcepts a little bit better than maybe\n\n14\n00:00:46.592 --> 00:00:49.240\njust chatting or through voice call.\n\n15\n00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.922\nSo a good PowerPoint presentation can\nalways put a whole room to sleep so.\n\n16\n00:00:53.922 --> 00:00:54.611\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n17\n00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:58.627\nwe're gonna show you how you can share\nthat through Skype for Business and\n\n18\n00:00:58.627 --> 00:01:00.182\nconducting your meetings or\n\n19\n00:01:00.182 --> 00:01:04.290\nyour webinars that you might be having\nthrough this particular client.\n\n20\n00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.900\nWe are going to show you from\na couple of different angles,\n\n21\n00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.760\nthis will take us into the world\nof being in a meeting.\n\n22\n00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.320\nOkay, just like some of the other\nthings where we talked about,\n\n23\n00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.190\nI believe at the whiteboard it\nautomatically creates you into a meeting,\n\n24\n00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.080\neven if you only have\none person in the room,\n\n25\n00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.730\nlike we're demonstrating, it takes you\ninto that role with the attendees and\n\n26\n00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.050\nthe presenters, and\nwho's got the right status and everything.\n\n27\n00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.670\nSo again, go back and watch those episodes\nabout the meeting so you understand\n\n28\n00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.470\nwhat we're talking about here, cuz this\nis just the PowerPoint section of it.\n\n29\n00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.390\nAs a big side note that we actually\nmade in the whiteboard episode,\n\n30\n00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.910\nI'm gonna make it here as well.\n\n31\n00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:51.120\nYou can't do this is you have people\nusing Skype for Business on a Mac.\n\n32\n00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.820\nThey won't be able to see\nthe PowerPoint presentation and\n\n33\n00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.160\nthey won't be able to\nparticipate in any of it really.\n\n34\n00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.930\nSo so just be very aware of,\non your receiving end,\n\n35\n00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.810\nwho are the people in your meeting and\nwhat version of Skype for\n\n36\n00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.902\nBusiness are they using.\n\n37\n00:02:09.902 --> 00:02:14.709\nSo and I'm gonna also throw that out\nbecause I've been focusing mostly on\n\n38\n00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.801\nSkype for Business for Mac, but\n\n39\n00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:21.784\nI'm gonna maybe throw it out there that\nmaybe Skype people can't see that.\n\n40\n00:02:21.784 --> 00:02:27.251\nI'm not, maybe I should hold back on\nthat because I really don't know but\n\n41\n00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:32.012\nif you do have people using Skype\nyou might wanna be careful about\n\n42\n00:02:32.012 --> 00:02:34.586\nwhat you can and cannot do with it.\n\n43\n00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:38.640\nSo yeah I'm not gonna claim that because I\ncan't back that up right now [LAUGH] but\n\n44\n00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.390\njust be aware of the other people on\nthe other end and what they are using and\n\n45\n00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.474\nof course if they are on a telephone, they\nare not gonna be able to see anything.\n\n46\n00:02:46.474 --> 00:02:50.882\n[LAUGH] So, along the same lines\nsince we talk about using your voice,\n\n47\n00:02:50.882 --> 00:02:55.366\nif you're going to be presenting\nwith a PowerPoint you probably gonna\n\n48\n00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:59.980\nwanna talk through the slides\nmost of the time I would assume.\n\n49\n00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.590\nSo you should always test your audio\nsettings before you get started as well,\n\n50\n00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.310\nmaking sure your microphone works,\neverybody sees you or hears you.\n\n51\n00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.840\nCan everybody hear me?\n\n52\n00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.220\nAll right, good, wonderful.\n\n53\n00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.608\nSo all those different setting.\n\n54\n00:03:13.608 --> 00:03:15.376\nSo why don't we got ahead and get started.\n\n55\n00:03:15.376 --> 00:03:21.870\nLike I said, we're going to take this from\nthe angle of the meeting organizer first.\n\n56\n00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.820\nSo I'm in Joey's computer.\n\n57\n00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.260\nSo he's gonna be the one that's gonna\nstart just an IM chat with Justin.\n\n58\n00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.390\nRonnie is Justin today again.\n\n59\n00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.674\nSo we'll start that up.\n\n60\n00:03:32.674 --> 00:03:38.095\nLet's start an IM cuz So it's good to\nestablish a line of communication before\n\n61\n00:03:38.095 --> 00:03:43.282\nyou start sharing any of your resources,\nso let's go ahead and say hello.\n\n62\n00:03:43.282 --> 00:03:47.630\nAnd we're like, yes that's great, let's\nstart a PowerPoint presentation Justin.\n\n63\n00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.120\nSo, we're gonna come down\nhere to our share content.\n\n64\n00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.536\nAnd once I come in to share content, I'm\ngonna come up to Share PowerPoint files,\n\n65\n00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:59.312\nall right, and of course,\nif you're in a scheduled meeting, like,\n\n66\n00:03:59.312 --> 00:04:02.384\nyou are the one that's coming in and\nrunning to meeting.\n\n67\n00:04:02.384 --> 00:04:06.192\nYou definitely wanna come into the room\nbeforehand, get the PowerPoint ready,\n\n68\n00:04:06.192 --> 00:04:06.757\nload it up.\n\n69\n00:04:06.757 --> 00:04:09.989\nAnd especially if you have\na really large PowerPoint,\n\n70\n00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.359\nit's gonna take a while to\nkinda get up into this system,\n\n71\n00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.080\nif you wanna say into the cloud for\nyou to be able to use it.\n\n72\n00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.450\nSo take all of those things under\nconsideration when you're gonna\n\n73\n00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.950\nstart a PowerPoint presentation\nin your particular meeting.\n\n74\n00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.540\nSo I'm gonna open up the audio Skype for\nBusiness.\n\n75\n00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.240\nThis is the one that we went over when\nwe were going over the audio episodes.\n\n76\n00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.070\nAnd what it shows is it's gonna\nimmediately show up on the stage,\n\n77\n00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.710\nyou can see it's loading right here.\n\n78\n00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.920\nThis is not a very big PowerPoint file and\nyou could see it did take a couple of\n\n79\n00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.290\nseconds, times that by a lot and\nit's gonna be a lot.\n\n80\n00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.400\nWow that was a really profound\nstatement wasn't that Ronnie?\n\n81\n00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.920\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH] Very profound.\n\n82\n00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.050\n&gt;&gt; It was.\n[LAUGH] So we've got this and\n\n83\n00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.929\nRonnie is seeing it right away as well.\n\n84\n00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.260\nRonny or I should say Justin.\n\n85\n00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.380\nJustin is a presenter, so\nthose are the two words we have in here.\n\n86\n00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.814\nBut now even though he's a presenter,\n\n87\n00:05:07.814 --> 00:05:12.483\nJustin here cannot control like who is\nthe attendees and so on and so forth.\n\n88\n00:05:12.483 --> 00:05:16.888\nSo those are different things\nyou're going to be able to adjust.\n\n89\n00:05:16.888 --> 00:05:20.918\nWell at least he can't make me\nan attendee, I should go ahead and\n\n90\n00:05:20.918 --> 00:05:21.898\nclarify that.\n\n91\n00:05:21.898 --> 00:05:25.640\nAs a presenter if there\nare other people in the meeting,\n\n92\n00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.077\nI believe they can go ahead and\ndo that, but not me.\n\n93\n00:05:29.077 --> 00:05:30.235\nI'm the organizer.\n\n94\n00:05:30.235 --> 00:05:35.073\n[LAUGH] All right, so I've got my slides\nready to go and down here at the bottom I\n\n95\n00:05:35.073 --> 00:05:39.988\nwas trying not to make it full screen, I\nwas just trying to make it move over just\n\n96\n00:05:39.988 --> 00:05:44.020\na little bit, I've got the thumbnails and\nI've got the notes.\n\n97\n00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.370\nWhen you click on it,\nit gives the thumbnails of the slide.\n\n98\n00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.630\nThat's pretty helpful.\n\n99\n00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.880\nAnd I could go ahead and\nscroll through here.\n\n100\n00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.510\nNow, notice when I'm scrolling\nthrough on the thumbnails,\n\n101\n00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.450\nIt's not actually changing\nthe slide that's right here.\n\n102\n00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:02.930\nSo just kind of know that, hey maybe I\nwanna see ahead, like what's coming up.\n\n103\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.933\nI don't remember what is in slide four or\nfive, you can go ahead and\n\n104\n00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:08.802\nnavigate via the thumbnails.\n\n105\n00:06:08.802 --> 00:06:13.631\nBut if you're going to forward the slides,\nyou want to go to the next slide and\n\n106\n00:06:13.631 --> 00:06:18.015\nhave everybody see the next slide,\nyou come down here to the bottom and\n\n107\n00:06:18.015 --> 00:06:19.753\nyou click the next button.\n\n108\n00:06:19.753 --> 00:06:23.860\nWhen I click the next button\nit goes to the next slide and\n\n109\n00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.356\nthat's what everybody\nis going to be seeing.\n\n110\n00:06:27.356 --> 00:06:28.818\nSo we can go through our slides.\n\n111\n00:06:28.818 --> 00:06:30.940\nWe can go back and forth.\n\n112\n00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.300\nIf I had some speaker notes and I'm going\nto go back over to slide one because I do\n\n113\n00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:41.920\nknow I put a very detailed note right\nhere, Speaker notes for PowerPoint.\n\n114\n00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.950\n[LAUGH] I added that into\nthat particular file so\n\n115\n00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.430\nyou can begin to see your speaker\nnotes right here on the screen, but\n\n116\n00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.290\nthe attendees are not going to see it.\n\n117\n00:06:54.290 --> 00:07:00.260\nThe other presenters will see the notes\nbecause they're in the leading group,\n\n118\n00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.810\nif you want to say.\n\n119\n00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.321\nThey're the ones that are going to\nbe presenting your information to\n\n120\n00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:09.379\nwhoever is in this particular\nmeetings based on their roles.\n\n121\n00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:10.456\nSo there are different options.\n\n122\n00:07:10.456 --> 00:07:15.460\nI believe you can click on the slide\nitself to go ahead and advance it.\n\n123\n00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.900\nI don't think you can use many of your,\nyou can use your arrow keys.\n\n124\n00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.350\nActually, I'm well surprised in that,\nI wasn't expecting it to do that.\n\n125\n00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.970\nSo there's probably some other\nways to advance these slides.\n\n126\n00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.080\nYep, the space bar works here.\n\n127\n00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.180\nSo, some of the same shortcuts you\nhave for a regular PowerPoint and\n\n128\n00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.440\nadvancing your slides,\nyou can go ahead and utilize them.\n\n129\n00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.736\nBut feel safe, you always got\nthe front and back arrows for\n\n130\n00:07:38.736 --> 00:07:42.077\ngoing backwards and\nforwards on your slide.\n\n131\n00:07:42.077 --> 00:07:46.137\nJust like in a normal\nPowerPoint presentation,\n\n132\n00:07:46.137 --> 00:07:50.004\nthere is the ability to\nannotate your slides.\n\n133\n00:07:50.004 --> 00:07:53.631\nSo, if I was going on to this side,\nlet's go ahead, and\n\n134\n00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:56.969\nI really wanna emphasize\nthe use of the Skype Call.\n\n135\n00:07:56.969 --> 00:08:02.111\nSo up here in a top right hand corner\nwe've got a little annotation Toolbar.\n\n136\n00:08:02.111 --> 00:08:06.658\nAnd this looks just like the whiteboard\nactually, Ronnie, because we have the ones\n\n137\n00:08:06.658 --> 00:08:11.053\nwhere we could use our pen, we could use\na highlighter, we could use a checkbox.\n\n138\n00:08:11.053 --> 00:08:15.793\nI could say, yep, check it on, or\nI could take my pencil and say, yep,\n\n139\n00:08:15.793 --> 00:08:18.090\nSkype Call, that's important.\n\n140\n00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:18.731\n[LAUGH] So\n\n141\n00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:25.200\nwe could draw any type of annotations\non the slides as we go through them.\n\n142\n00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.750\nThe other nice thing, here let me go ahead\nand go to the next one, is that your\n\n143\n00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:34.740\npresenter, anybody that is in\nthat role can annotate the slide.\n\n144\n00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.000\nSo Ronnie, if you don't mind,\nwould you go ahead and draw a circle,\n\n145\n00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.440\nor just go ahead and\nannotate the slide however you feel.\n\n146\n00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.673\nThere we go, let's go [LAUGH] ahead and\n\n147\n00:08:43.673 --> 00:08:45.905\nunderline Skype Call,\nput a circle around here.\n\n148\n00:08:45.905 --> 00:08:49.595\nSo you can think about,\nif you have a co-presenter,\n\n149\n00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:54.425\nI might be in charge of just talking\nthrough everything, and Justin or\n\n150\n00:08:54.425 --> 00:08:59.477\nRonnie would go ahead and start annotating\nthe slides and moving things around.\n\n151\n00:08:59.477 --> 00:09:04.237\nSo those roles do allow you\nto have multiple people kinda\n\n152\n00:09:04.237 --> 00:09:07.417\nhelping along with that presentation.\n\n153\n00:09:07.417 --> 00:09:11.210\nIn that annotation, you do have\na little pointer, the laser pointer.\n\n154\n00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:16.560\nSo if I wanted to give some super focus\nto this particular part of the slide,\n\n155\n00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.560\nyou can do that, and\njust kinda draw attention.\n\n156\n00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.000\nThere you go, you can see Justin coming\non in there right there, to show that,\n\n157\n00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.310\nhey, I'm a presenter too,\nI can turn on the laser pointer!\n\n158\n00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.380\nSo [LAUGH], so we've got those\ndifferent parts right there.\n\n159\n00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.390\nAnd you do have the other options in here,\nto go ahead and\n\n160\n00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.910\ndelete all the annotations on this page.\n\n161\n00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.180\nCuz maybe you're like, mm, okay,\n\n162\n00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.270\nI wanna clean that off,\nwe could go ahead and do that.\n\n163\n00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.400\nAnd it says,\nare you sure you want to do that?\n\n164\n00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.480\nYep, we're good, and it will delete all\nthe annotations, so that's pretty nice.\n\n165\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.336\nSo now you can just go ahead and\ngo through everything, and\n\n166\n00:09:51.336 --> 00:09:53.387\nconduct your PowerPoint presentation.\n\n167\n00:09:53.387 --> 00:09:57.712\nNow anytime that you are sharing\nany type of content,\n\n168\n00:09:57.712 --> 00:10:02.713\ndesktops or whiteboards,\nPowerPoint, it all goes down into\n\n169\n00:10:02.713 --> 00:10:07.790\nyour Manage Content, and\nI'm gonna scroll on down here.\n\n170\n00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:12.140\nIf we go to our Share Content button,\nwe have the Manage Content right there.\n\n171\n00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.690\nAnd that's where everything\nthat you upload into\n\n172\n00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.660\nyour stage within your\nmeeting is going to be set.\n\n173\n00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.860\nSo if I Stop Sharing,\nI'm just gonna click that for\n\n174\n00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.350\none second, if I wanna bring this back up,\n\n175\n00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:30.830\nyou don't have to go back and share the\nPowerPoint again, it's already in there.\n\n176\n00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:36.102\nYou could just come back down to this\nManage Content, and then you can pull\n\n177\n00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:41.224\nthis back up and put this into your\nsharing window, and onto the stage.\n\n178\n00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:45.667\nA few other things you can see in the\nManage Content is how you can allow people\n\n179\n00:10:45.667 --> 00:10:49.170\nto download this information\nfrom your meeting.\n\n180\n00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.430\nIf you had attendees, you could say, hey,\n\n181\n00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:55.590\nI want the attendees to be able to\ndownload it, or just the presenters,\n\n182\n00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.810\nor everyone, that would be presenters,\nand attendees.\n\n183\n00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:04.640\nYou could also remove it from the content\narea, I just don't want that part of it.\n\n184\n00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.150\nAnd then there's some other ones that\nyou can do, where if you have a Save As,\n\n185\n00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.360\nyou could also send it to OneNote.\n\n186\n00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.210\nYou can also save it with the annotations,\nso like hey, I really liked how I marked\n\n187\n00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.850\nup this presentation,\nI wanna go ahead and do that.\n\n188\n00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.513\nNotice it will just take you\nright out to your Desktop.\n\n189\n00:11:22.513 --> 00:11:26.677\nIt's actually, that's interesting,\nwhen you save it with the annotations,\n\n190\n00:11:26.677 --> 00:11:28.480\nit's going as an XPS.\n\n191\n00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.847\nThat's the only version that you\nare allowed to save that out.\n\n192\n00:11:31.847 --> 00:11:35.287\nMm, good job Microsoft for\nforcing us to use that file format.\n\n193\n00:11:35.287 --> 00:11:38.490\n[LAUGH] For those of you who are like,\nwhat is that?\n\n194\n00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:42.008\nIt's Microsoft's version of a PDF, okay,\n\n195\n00:11:42.008 --> 00:11:46.463\nthey went ahead and\ntried to kinda compete on that level.\n\n196\n00:11:46.463 --> 00:11:48.106\nI mean it's a valid format.\n\n197\n00:11:48.106 --> 00:11:48.848\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not saying\n\n198\n00:11:48.848 --> 00:11:51.587\nthere's something with it, it's just-\n&gt;&gt; Not used.\n\n199\n00:11:51.587 --> 00:11:54.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] good point Ronnie, yeah-\n&gt;&gt; Just not used.\n\n200\n00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.738\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\nit's just not, it's not a pdf.\n\n201\n00:11:57.738 --> 00:11:58.799\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So [LAUGH] so\n\n202\n00:11:58.799 --> 00:12:02.506\nI was honestly expecting it\nto be a PowerPoint slide, but\n\n203\n00:12:02.506 --> 00:12:06.460\nthat's all right,\nwe can roll with your file format there.\n\n204\n00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:11.892\nAnd then you can, of course, always just\nsave it out from there, because maybe,\n\n205\n00:12:11.892 --> 00:12:17.663\nI'm the organizer right now, but say maybe\nJoey, no, Justin, that guy over there.\n\n206\n00:12:17.663 --> 00:12:21.211\n[LAUGH] He doesn't have it, so\nhe can go ahead and save it from there,\n\n207\n00:12:21.211 --> 00:12:23.570\nbecause he is a presenter.\n\n208\n00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:27.870\nSo some different things that you can do\nwith your PowerPoint presentations, and\n\n209\n00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.760\nhow you can share them.\n\n210\n00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:35.220\nSo at this point what we're going to\ndo is, we're going to end this meeting.\n\n211\n00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.570\nCuz remember it is a meeting, so\nyou always want to close the door and say,\n\n212\n00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:40.600\nall right guys, we're all done here.\n\n213\n00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.870\nBecause that was how you can\nrun a PowerPoint presentation\n\n214\n00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.980\nas an organizer, you could see all\nthe different things that you can do.\n\n215\n00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.170\nSo I'm gonna come down here,\nI'm gonna end the meeting right there, so\n\n216\n00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:59.380\nthat way we've stopped this as me,\nJoey Fatone, being the organizer.\n\n217\n00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:06.320\nWhat we're going to do now is,\nJustin over here is going to start a chat,\n\n218\n00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.959\nlet's go ahead and start a new chat if\nyou don't mind there, Justin please.\n\n219\n00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:16.480\nAnd what we're gonna do is, Ronnie\n[LAUGH] is gonna go ahead and be the one\n\n220\n00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.980\nto share out the PowerPoint from his\ncomputer, so he'll be the organizer.\n\n221\n00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:27.370\nAnd I as Joey,\nI will be the secondary presenter,\n\n222\n00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:32.010\nso you can see what it's like\nin that particular role.\n\n223\n00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.550\nSo are you ready for\nthe meeting with PowerPoint?\n\n224\n00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.478\nAnd I will say, yes, let's go.\n\n225\n00:13:38.478 --> 00:13:43.680\nAnd I will try to move this over\nwithout full screening it, there we go.\n\n226\n00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:50.385\nSo we're going to wait for Ronnie to go\nahead and upload that, you could see,\n\n227\n00:13:50.385 --> 00:13:52.970\nooh, that little video button flashed for\na minute.\n\n228\n00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:57.078\nThere we go, so now you can see I\nam just allowing this to load up.\n\n229\n00:13:57.078 --> 00:14:01.434\nAnd notice at the top it\nsays Take Over as Presenter,\n\n230\n00:14:01.434 --> 00:14:05.493\nnow that would mean that\nI am the main presenter,\n\n231\n00:14:05.493 --> 00:14:10.020\nI'm going to kinda take on\nthe role of the organizer.\n\n232\n00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.031\nAnd the biggest difference is,\n\n233\n00:14:12.031 --> 00:14:15.689\nit's going to be that I'm\ncontrolling how the slides go.\n\n234\n00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:20.373\nSo Ronnie, if you don't mind, you can see,\nyeah, he is advancing the slides here.\n\n235\n00:14:20.373 --> 00:14:24.839\nBut if I click on the thumbnails,\nas the secondary presenter, and\n\n236\n00:14:24.839 --> 00:14:29.890\nI start moving through this, right,\nI'm just going through the slides.\n\n237\n00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:34.550\nBut if I click the advance slides,\nlook at what happens,\n\n238\n00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:40.100\nI am privately viewing this\nparticular presentation.\n\n239\n00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:45.082\nAs I'm advancing it,\nI'm advancing it for me, not for\n\n240\n00:14:45.082 --> 00:14:50.176\nwhat everybody else is seeing\nas the presenter's view.\n\n241\n00:14:50.176 --> 00:14:55.015\nSo that's why you can see up at the top\nnow, I have a button that says,\n\n242\n00:14:55.015 --> 00:14:57.650\nReturn to Presenter's View.\n\n243\n00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:05.480\nIf I click on that, this is the particular\nslide that Ronnie/Justin is on.\n\n244\n00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.554\nSo you can see,\nas somebody that is a co-presenter, or\n\n245\n00:15:09.554 --> 00:15:13.580\nthe non-organizer, but\nstill in a presenter roll.\n\n246\n00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.710\nI can do some other things,\nlike if he's on this slide,\n\n247\n00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:18.460\nhe's on the Phone Call slide.\n\n248\n00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.560\nLet's say that I know that\nthis particular slide,\n\n249\n00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.850\nwe're gonna need to do some annotation.\n\n250\n00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.110\nSo I'm gonna come up here,\nI'm privately viewing,\n\n251\n00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.530\nnow I got a second one\ncuz I'm doing it again.\n\n252\n00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:34.770\nI can come up here, and\nI can make an annotation,\n\n253\n00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.160\njust draw a star,\n[LAUGH] on this particular one.\n\n254\n00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.265\nIf I go to the Presenter's View,\nhe's still on the Phone Call, and\n\n255\n00:15:41.265 --> 00:15:45.597\nsee he's drawing it up, so\neverybody else is seeing what he's doing.\n\n256\n00:15:45.597 --> 00:15:51.810\nWhen Ronnie advances to the next slide,\nit's going to show the annotations that I,\n\n257\n00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:56.110\nas that second presenter,\nwent ahead and marked up on it.\n\n258\n00:15:56.110 --> 00:16:01.720\nSo that's why you see this Privately\nviewing coming up here at the bottom,\n\n259\n00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:07.152\nbecause I can do things to this\nPowerPoint presentation that are just for\n\n260\n00:16:07.152 --> 00:16:08.844\nwhat I'm looking at,\n\n261\n00:16:08.844 --> 00:16:14.180\nnot everybody else in the room which\nI think is kinda cool actually.\n\n262\n00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.370\nSo as like a helper through all of this,\n\n263\n00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:22.190\nI know what that means now and\nwhat I can do to control it.\n\n264\n00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.100\nAnd if I return back, the other\nthing is if I wanted to go ahead and\n\n265\n00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.690\ntake over as the presenter.\n\n266\n00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:32.100\nIt's like, okay, so now Joey back to you,\nthen I unmute my microphone and say, okay\n\n267\n00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.380\ngreat, so let me go ahead and show you\nwhere we need to go next, and everything.\n\n268\n00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:40.620\nNotice that my button up at\nthe top says Stop Sharing,\n\n269\n00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:45.580\nbecause I don't have the viewing\nprivately anymore, now I could,\n\n270\n00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:49.301\nand I don't know how many\nof you all catched that.\n\n271\n00:16:49.301 --> 00:16:53.180\nBut down here, I believe when\nI go into the Manage Content,\n\n272\n00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:59.248\nthere was another in the more,\nI'm not [LAUGH] the organizer any more.\n\n273\n00:16:59.248 --> 00:17:04.070\n[LAUGH] But as the organizer\nthere is a button that says,\n\n274\n00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:07.820\nview privately, in that option there,\nin the Manage Content.\n\n275\n00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.586\nAnd that's exactly what I'm showing you,\n\n276\n00:17:10.586 --> 00:17:15.080\nis that it will be private to only you and\nnot everybody in the room.\n\n277\n00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:19.760\nOkay, so I will go ahead and you can grab\ncontrol back over there correct Ronnie?\n\n278\n00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.360\nYou can-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n279\n00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.510\n&gt;&gt; Take that and\nsay that you become the main presenter and\n\n280\n00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:28.440\nthen my buttons will come\nback as the taking over and\n\n281\n00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:34.180\nthen viewing the Powerpoint presentation\nprivately if I wanted to do that.\n\n282\n00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:41.010\nWonderful, so\nthat's the role of a secondary presenter.\n\n283\n00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:45.260\nNow the next one we're gonna show,\njust so you get an idea of what\n\n284\n00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:49.495\nyour end users are seeing,\nif you have them as attendees, okay.\n\n285\n00:17:49.495 --> 00:17:55.490\nNow if you're in a company meeting,\nmaybe all of you are presenters and\n\n286\n00:17:55.490 --> 00:18:00.490\nyou've never really messed with this\nbefore, because it's like well we can all\n\n287\n00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:03.350\ndo what we need to do to the PowerPoint\nbecause we're collaborating on it.\n\n288\n00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:07.360\nBut if you're conducting a webinar,\nthen having people as attendees,\n\n289\n00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.820\nit's always nice to see\nwhat they're seeing.\n\n290\n00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.600\nSo if you don't mind Ronnie,\ncan you go ahead and demote or\n\n291\n00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.530\njust change the role\nof Joey to a attendee.\n\n292\n00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.592\nAnd by the way, the way he is doing\nthat is over here, right clicking\n\n293\n00:18:22.592 --> 00:18:27.388\non the particular person, and then\nchoosing make, does it say make attendee?\n\n294\n00:18:27.388 --> 00:18:29.166\n&gt;&gt; Let's see if I can find it here.\n\n295\n00:18:29.166 --> 00:18:31.198\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, yeah, hover over Joey and\n\n296\n00:18:31.198 --> 00:18:34.883\nthen right click on his,\ntwo finger click on that computer.\n\n297\n00:18:34.883 --> 00:18:35.581\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n298\n00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:39.473\n&gt;&gt; He's using my MacBook and\nhis old MacBook, there you go.\n\n299\n00:18:39.473 --> 00:18:43.597\n[LAUGH] So you can see that now Joey,\nme I'm an attendee, I can see it in\n\n300\n00:18:43.597 --> 00:18:48.576\nthe participant, because that's just the\npain I can do that as a participant, but\n\n301\n00:18:48.576 --> 00:18:52.371\nalso there's hey, you're an attendee,\nsit back and enjoy.\n\n302\n00:18:52.371 --> 00:18:55.259\nCool, so\nI don't have any of those buttons,\n\n303\n00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:58.455\nI can't control anything,\nI can't click on it.\n\n304\n00:18:58.455 --> 00:19:03.073\nI was actually thinking, yes,\nyou can go into full screen, so\n\n305\n00:19:03.073 --> 00:19:06.350\nyou can take that into consideration.\n\n306\n00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:09.230\nI thought you could do it by double\nclicking but it looks like as attendee,\n\n307\n00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:11.760\nyou can't do that, but\nat least you know you have the button.\n\n308\n00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.150\nSo that's the biggest thing,\n\n309\n00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.548\nyou might have been able to\nmaybe figure that out like.\n\n310\n00:19:17.548 --> 00:19:19.970\nHopefully attendees can't do anything,\nthat's true.\n\n311\n00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:24.201\nSo [LAUGH] but we do talk more about\nall the roles of the attendees, and\n\n312\n00:19:24.201 --> 00:19:29.118\nwhat you can do as an organizer to control\nwhat the attendees can and cannot do.\n\n313\n00:19:29.118 --> 00:19:31.312\nCan they chat,\ncan they turn on their video?\n\n314\n00:19:31.312 --> 00:19:35.276\nCuz you probably don't want people just\npopping up videos all the time if you're\n\n315\n00:19:35.276 --> 00:19:37.034\ntrying to do a major presentation.\n\n316\n00:19:37.034 --> 00:19:41.795\n[LAUGH] So just make sure you know all\nabout how to control your meetings while\n\n317\n00:19:41.795 --> 00:19:46.518\nyou're running things, and make sure\nyou keep your attendees in check.\n\n318\n00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:52.070\nSo [LAUGH] and that's really all I\nhave for PowerPoint presentations.\n\n319\n00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:56.290\nI would say it's mostly intuitive,\nI think the secondary\n\n320\n00:19:56.290 --> 00:20:00.924\npresenter thing can get a little weird\nin why I'm seeing this differently, and\n\n321\n00:20:00.924 --> 00:20:03.440\nlike, gosh,\nare they seeing me advance the slides.\n\n322\n00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:08.040\nNope, you're good, as long as you well,\nknow what you're doing, so, pretty good.\n\n323\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.880\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne, well,\nthank you for helping us out here,\n\n324\n00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.990\nespecially with working with PowerPoint.\n\n325\n00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.990\nIt's easy enough to understand\nwhy we do PowerPoints, but\n\n326\n00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.710\nthe ability to use something\nlike Skype for Business\n\n327\n00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:22.930\nto allow us to share the PowerPoint\npresentation, not only to share it, but\n\n328\n00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.794\nallow somebody else to also present\nit is a very powerful feature.\n\n329\n00:20:26.794 --> 00:20:30.720\nAnd being able to handoff and doing\nthe annotations, really do help make your\n\n330\n00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.980\nPowerPoint presentation much more\neffective over a greater distance as well.\n\n331\n00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.860\nAnd it's a tool that we should\nactually be very interested in,\n\n332\n00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.050\nif we do tend to lead a lot of meetings.\n\n333\n00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.820\nBut that's a great place for\nus to also sign off then.\n\n334\n00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.200\nFor OfficeProTV I'm your host,\nRonnie Wong.\n\n335\n00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.130\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n336\n00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:50.236\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Skype for Business episodes.\n\n337\n00:20:50.236 --> 00:20:55.760\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.170\nYou're watching the Skype for\nBusiness Show.\n\n4\n00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.700\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.560\nAnd today, we're gonna be showing you how\nto conduct a poll in Skype for Business.\n\n6\n00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.890\nAnd here to help us once again is gonna\nbe our Office Pro virtuoso herself,\n\n7\n00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.540\nMiss Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.555\nVonne welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:34.220\n&gt;&gt; I'm so glad to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.241\nAlways so much fun with you Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:35.890\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n12\n00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.176\nSo Vonne, here it is,\nwhat is this idea of a poll?\n\n13\n00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:44.466\nWe've already talked about using\na Whiteboard, we've also of course shared\n\n14\n00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:48.600\nPowerPoints and this is part of\na collaboration, what is this about?\n\n15\n00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.323\n&gt;&gt; Well it's just like what you\nwould consider taking a poll or\n\n16\n00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:55.605\nconducting a poll,\nbeing part of a survey, right?\n\n17\n00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:58.418\nIt's like you have a question,\nwho here likes ice cream?\n\n18\n00:00:58.418 --> 00:00:59.685\nMe.\n\n19\n00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:03.383\n[LAUGH] And then the question be yes or\nno or maybe,\n\n20\n00:01:03.383 --> 00:01:06.722\nwhat is your favorite\nflavor of ice cream and\n\n21\n00:01:06.722 --> 00:01:12.250\nthen you ahead and\nsays well 55% of all people say chocolate.\n\n22\n00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.383\nJust totally making it up, but\nyou have that whole idea of,\n\n23\n00:01:15.383 --> 00:01:19.471\nthere's a certain percentage of people\nwho answered the question this way.\n\n24\n00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:24.844\nAnd so if you think about in a meeting,\nthat can be a great way to interact and\n\n25\n00:01:24.844 --> 00:01:30.135\ncollaborate with your users and\nthe attendees of your meeting, all right\n\n26\n00:01:30.135 --> 00:01:35.530\nwhat do you think is the best way that\nwe should answer this team question?\n\n27\n00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.137\nI am totally making things up, but you get\nthe idea of being able to kinda throw it\n\n28\n00:01:40.137 --> 00:01:45.150\nout to them, then to participate and\nthen they see all the answers.\n\n29\n00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.090\nNow that's something that you,\n\n30\n00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.788\nas the organizer of the meeting,\nyou're gonna need to know how to control.\n\n31\n00:01:50.788 --> 00:01:54.660\nSo that's what we're here to show you,\nis how to control all of that and\n\n32\n00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.870\nthen we'll flip it over and\n\n33\n00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.160\nthen show you how the attendees see\nit on the other side of the coin.\n\n34\n00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.325\nAnd then how to answer the question\nbecause it's always good\n\n35\n00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:04.051\nto know both sides.\n\n36\n00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:08.726\nIf you're the only one that's ever going\nto organize, you need to know what\n\n37\n00:02:08.726 --> 00:02:13.036\nyour end users see to be able to just\nreally understand everything that\n\n38\n00:02:13.036 --> 00:02:17.602\nyou're doing in a meeting and\nto really like conduct a seamless meeting.\n\n39\n00:02:17.602 --> 00:02:19.600\nSo it's not like, oops,\nI clicked the wrong button.\n\n40\n00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.733\nAnd then I'm like, wait, I do that all\ntime in these shows [LAUGH] but you get\n\n41\n00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:30.450\nthe idea of making sure that you know\nhow to use all of these different tools.\n\n42\n00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.140\nSo, that's what we're going to do today,\nRonnie.\n\n43\n00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.770\nAll right, Vonne, it sounds like a good\nway also to keep our people that are in\n\n44\n00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.360\nthis meeting engaged by asking them these\ntypes of questions every once in awhile.\n\n45\n00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.120\nOr if you really needed the feedback from\nthem so that you knew what to proceed on.\n\n46\n00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.373\nSo Vonne, show us how we're gonna\nstart doing something like this.\n\n47\n00:02:47.373 --> 00:02:50.845\n&gt;&gt; All right, well we have Joey's\ncomputer all ready to go and\n\n48\n00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:53.385\nI've actually got a group chat going.\n\n49\n00:02:53.385 --> 00:02:56.542\nSo we're still saying in chat cuz\nwe're not turning on videos or\n\n50\n00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:58.585\naudios or anything like that.\n\n51\n00:02:58.585 --> 00:03:03.215\nAnd I actually have a couple of people in\nthe room, I have me as the organizer and\n\n52\n00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:07.414\nI also have Justin and\nwe have our good friends Marisha and\n\n53\n00:03:07.414 --> 00:03:08.840\nRenee in the room as well.\n\n54\n00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.835\nBut do know, this is a meeting and with\nthese roles in our meetings I have put\n\n55\n00:03:13.835 --> 00:03:17.022\neverybody else besides\nmyself as an attendee.\n\n56\n00:03:17.022 --> 00:03:21.920\nNow this is something good to where\nthey're not going to be able to control\n\n57\n00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.360\nthe polls and I want them to see it as\nan attendee and not as a presenter status.\n\n58\n00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.870\nSo that's something to know\nabout with meetings and\n\n59\n00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.130\nthen to control how that all works.\n\n60\n00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.870\nI'm also just for fun I'm going to turn\noff their videos, I know my girls and\n\n61\n00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.886\nthey're probably gonna be like,\nI'm not coming on the video.\n\n62\n00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:43.653\nWell at least not today,\ncuz I haven't warned them and\n\n63\n00:03:43.653 --> 00:03:46.550\nwe know about our hair washing\nschedule there, Ronnie.\n\n64\n00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.550\nSo well that might be\nanother time [LAUGH].\n\n65\n00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.950\nSo I'm going to say, thank you for coming.\n\n66\n00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.590\nAnd we will say, we are going\n\n67\n00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.522\nto conduct a poll in a few seconds.\n\n68\n00:04:06.522 --> 00:04:10.490\nJust to let them know that\nthis is coming in our chat.\n\n69\n00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.030\nSo now, how do I go ahead and\nstart this poll?\n\n70\n00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.455\nIt's in our share content and\nthen we go to our More,\n\n71\n00:04:20.455 --> 00:04:26.805\nevery time I start this I'm like wait,\nwhere, it's in the More section.\n\n72\n00:04:26.805 --> 00:04:31.040\n[LAUGH] All right, so there we go,\nwe've got our poll right there.\n\n73\n00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.920\nNow, this is something that I'm\ncreating on the fly, all right?\n\n74\n00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.454\nThis is where I'm coming into this poll,\n\n75\n00:04:36.454 --> 00:04:40.940\nnow nothing that I'm doing right now\nis being shown on the their screens.\n\n76\n00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.280\nSo take into consideration,\nyou might not want to,\n\n77\n00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.150\nespecially if you have lengthy answers\nthat you need to have them choose from,\n\n78\n00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.090\nyou're gonna wanna do this beforehand.\n\n79\n00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.790\nSo in a scheduled meeting where you\n\n80\n00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.820\nare gonna go into the meeting\nroom before everybody gets there,\n\n81\n00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.850\nyou're gonna control how people are in\nthe lobby and not in there just yet.\n\n82\n00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.220\nYou go ahead and\npreload all of your poll questions,\n\n83\n00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.610\nbecause just like any\nof our shared content,\n\n84\n00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.640\nit's gonna go into the managed content and\nthen you can be able to pull those\n\n85\n00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.740\nquestions up when you're ready to do that\nparticular poll within your presentation.\n\n86\n00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.295\nAnd you don't have to have them waiting\nwhile you're typing all that out.\n\n87\n00:05:19.295 --> 00:05:22.295\nSo definitely take note of that and\nif you don't know what I'm talking about,\n\n88\n00:05:22.295 --> 00:05:26.675\ndefinitely go back over to some of our\nmeeting episodes and the content so\n\n89\n00:05:26.675 --> 00:05:27.627\nyou can understand that.\n\n90\n00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:31.955\nSo we're just gonna do\nsomething really simple like,\n\n91\n00:05:31.955 --> 00:05:36.764\nwhat is your favorite animal,\nalways gotta go with animal.\n\n92\n00:05:36.764 --> 00:05:39.052\nI know we talked about ice cream,\nwe'll do that next, all right?\n\n93\n00:05:39.052 --> 00:05:39.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n94\n00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.540\n&gt;&gt; So we'll go with, I'm gonna go\nwith cats and then we'll go with dog,\n\n95\n00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.660\nwe'll go with bunny and we'll go with\ngremlin, we'll go with that so [LAUGH].\n\n96\n00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.598\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n97\n00:05:52.598 --> 00:05:55.649\n&gt;&gt; So we'll have a gremlin and\nI'm gonna go ahead and click create.\n\n98\n00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.095\nAnd then,\nwhat happens is the stage pops up and\n\n99\n00:06:00.095 --> 00:06:03.752\nnow all of my attendees\nare seeing what is on the screen.\n\n100\n00:06:03.752 --> 00:06:06.220\nIt says, what is your favorite animal?\n\n101\n00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.890\nAnd then you can see,\nagain, I'm the presenter,\n\n102\n00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.710\nI am the organizer, I can see people\nare starting to answer the question.\n\n103\n00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.160\nNow by default the poll is open, so\n\n104\n00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.900\nthat means that everybody can see\nthis as soon as I pop this up.\n\n105\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.650\nAnd then the other thing to notice,\nby default,\n\n106\n00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.760\nis that the results are hidden\nfrom the attendees.\n\n107\n00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.170\nSo the attendees are answering\nthe question right now and\n\n108\n00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.362\nthis is also something like when\nyou're in the presentation,\n\n109\n00:06:34.362 --> 00:06:35.360\nyou're probably gonna go ahead and\n\n110\n00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.970\nsay, all right take the next 30 seconds\nto go ahead and answer these questions,\n\n111\n00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.830\nreally think about it all that thing and\nyou're seeing the results come in.\n\n112\n00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.120\nI can see that I've had\nthree people respond to me,\n\n113\n00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.380\nI have three people in the room,\nso it's awesome.\n\n114\n00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.290\nSo everyone ahead and\nanswered my question so that's lovely.\n\n115\n00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.880\nNow down here at the bottom,\nyou have the poll actions and\n\n116\n00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.980\nthe poll actions, these are things that\nyou're going to control as the organizer.\n\n117\n00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.435\nSo and again,\nthis is that kind of practicing and\n\n118\n00:07:05.435 --> 00:07:10.495\nknowing what all these things do to\nmake that seamless presentation and\n\n119\n00:07:10.495 --> 00:07:14.205\nkeep this engagement,\nactually engaging and not,\n\n120\n00:07:14.205 --> 00:07:18.820\nokay I did not really want\nthe attendees to see that just yet.\n\n121\n00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.747\nSo l am gonna close the poll and\nl would verbally say, all right,\n\n122\n00:07:21.747 --> 00:07:23.917\nwell now we have all\nthe results in that are in and\n\n123\n00:07:23.917 --> 00:07:27.139\nthey we will see down at the bottom,\nas well, that the poll is closed.\n\n124\n00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:32.160\nBut l want them to see, so now let's\ngo ahead and see what you all said,\n\n125\n00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.013\nso l'm going to change this to,\nthe result are shown to everyone and\n\n126\n00:07:37.013 --> 00:07:40.890\nwhen l click on that,\nthen they see the results.\n\n127\n00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:45.010\nMe as the organizer, I'm not seeing\nanything different, okay, because\n\n128\n00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.690\nI saw all this from the very beginning,\nbut they're gonna see the result.\n\n129\n00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.080\nAnd I don't know why anybody\ndidn't choose a bunny.\n\n130\n00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.540\nI think that is a bad choice.\n\n131\n00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.250\nSo you know what I'm gonna do?\n\n132\n00:07:55.250 --> 00:08:02.808\nI'm gonna say, no bunny, and\nthen I'm gonna say, let's try again.\n\n133\n00:08:02.808 --> 00:08:08.559\n[LAUGH] So what I'm going to\ndo is I'm going to [LAUGH],\n\n134\n00:08:08.559 --> 00:08:12.650\nthat's not very nice, Justin.\n\n135\n00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.072\nSo, you know how much I love you.\n\n136\n00:08:14.072 --> 00:08:17.295\nSo if you go ahead and\nclear everybody's votes,\n\n137\n00:08:17.295 --> 00:08:23.040\nagain I'm on the organizer, I'm gonna\nclick OK and I'm gonna start over.\n\n138\n00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.490\nNow I'm like okay why\nisn't anybody answering?\n\n139\n00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.089\nWell, that's because I have\nto open the poll, okay?\n\n140\n00:08:28.089 --> 00:08:31.431\nSo let's go ahead and open the poll and\n\n141\n00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:36.665\nI will say the poll is open,\nchoose the right answer [LAUGH].\n\n142\n00:08:39.458 --> 00:08:45.250\nAnd you can see that now I'm seeing that\nthe answers are coming in, all right.\n\n143\n00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:50.250\nI've got [LAUGH] somebody keeps\npicking Gremlin, I wonder who that is.\n\n144\n00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:54.660\nSo, [LAUGH] we could see that I've\ngot some responses coming in.\n\n145\n00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.020\nSo, notice that thinking about if you're\ndoing a presentation of where you ask\n\n146\n00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:03.530\nthe same question but from two different\nperspectives, like if I was the manager,\n\n147\n00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.180\nhow would I answer this question?\n\n148\n00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.780\nBut if I was the customer,\nhow had I answer that question?\n\n149\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.140\nSo you could see using\nthe same question and\n\n150\n00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.530\nthen clearing the results, opening\nthe poll, that could be really effective.\n\n151\n00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.470\nLet´s go ahead and close the poll,\n\n152\n00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:21.610\nthat´s always a good thing to kinda\ncontrol when people can respond.\n\n153\n00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.748\nAnd then I will show the results.\n\n154\n00:09:23.748 --> 00:09:25.422\nWell, actually, you know what,\n\n155\n00:09:25.422 --> 00:09:28.090\nI just showed the results\nto everyone automatically.\n\n156\n00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:32.409\nSo you know what, there was something else\nI probably should have done before I went\n\n157\n00:09:32.409 --> 00:09:34.270\nahead and opened the poll.\n\n158\n00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.449\nProbably should have went ahead and\nhid the results from the attendees.\n\n159\n00:09:37.449 --> 00:09:42.097\nSo hey,\nI am showing by example of what not to do.\n\n160\n00:09:42.097 --> 00:09:46.339\n[LAUGH] Or just things to always\nconsider when you're going to\n\n161\n00:09:46.339 --> 00:09:50.840\nbe opening up these questions\nto people and seeing everything.\n\n162\n00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.365\nNow of course I could go ahead and\nedit the poll question and go into,\n\n163\n00:09:55.365 --> 00:09:59.890\nwe can add, maybe a pig in there.\n\n164\n00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:04.005\nEdit away, all current responses will be\ncleared, that's kind of a good thing to\n\n165\n00:10:04.005 --> 00:10:09.660\nnotice right there, is,\nis that if I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n166\n00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:14.700\nedit this, now I'm taking a new poll,\nyou might wanna make sure you verbalize.\n\n167\n00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.390\nAll of these things that you're\ndoing when you are presenting and\n\n168\n00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.370\nI might say new poll and\nthen we'll go ahead and\n\n169\n00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:28.300\nlet's do the right way, let's hide\nthe results and we will open the the poll.\n\n170\n00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.880\nAnd so now,\nyou can see that I am hiding and\n\n171\n00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.580\nI can see all the things\nthat I'm doing down here.\n\n172\n00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:38.513\nOkay, I've got the results hidden from\nattendees, I've got the poll open,\n\n173\n00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:41.966\nso I can see the responses\nare coming in and there we go.\n\n174\n00:10:41.966 --> 00:10:46.090\nAnd you can see that people\njust aren't picking the Bunny.\n\n175\n00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:51.106\n[LAUGH] And so, I can go ahead and\nclose the poll.\n\n176\n00:10:51.106 --> 00:10:57.085\nAd then, I can show the results\nto everybody, and okay, bunny.\n\n177\n00:10:57.085 --> 00:11:00.360\n[LAUGH]\nAnd then, of course,\n\n178\n00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.980\nI can go ahead and\nmake a smiley face right there.\n\n179\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:07.673\nSo you could see that this is where I\ncould go ahead and keep some interaction.\n\n180\n00:11:07.673 --> 00:11:11.206\nI know my friends are messing with me,\nso we could see that all\n\n181\n00:11:11.206 --> 00:11:15.680\nof the different options we have right\nhere in the actions the we've got.\n\n182\n00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:20.005\nNow some of the other things that\nwe didn't actually choose or\n\n183\n00:11:20.005 --> 00:11:25.329\nactually the only other option was\nthe save poll results, so every time that\n\n184\n00:11:25.329 --> 00:11:31.006\nI had conducted this poll, I could have\nbeen saving the poll results as an image.\n\n185\n00:11:31.006 --> 00:11:35.734\nSo I could have asked the first question\nand said okay, result's one and\n\n186\n00:11:35.734 --> 00:11:38.691\nthen the next time, I answer, results two.\n\n187\n00:11:38.691 --> 00:11:44.007\nAnd then that way you can use that as\nresources for your median like maybe\n\n188\n00:11:44.007 --> 00:11:50.222\nat the end, you're going to send them all\nthe pictures of the results of the polls.\n\n189\n00:11:50.222 --> 00:11:53.445\nAnd you can do that by either\nadding it into One Drive and\n\n190\n00:11:53.445 --> 00:11:55.840\nthen sharing out the link to everybody.\n\n191\n00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:00.549\nYou could go ahead and attach the files in\nyour meeting content and then go ahead and\n\n192\n00:12:00.549 --> 00:12:01.721\nlet them download.\n\n193\n00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:05.627\nThere's a couple different ways that\nyou can utilize how you're going to\n\n194\n00:12:05.627 --> 00:12:06.640\ndistribute them.\n\n195\n00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.837\nThat's, there's a whole\nbunch of options there.\n\n196\n00:12:09.837 --> 00:12:13.141\nSo you could see that I\ncould take the example,\n\n197\n00:12:13.141 --> 00:12:16.714\nsorry the results of the poll and\nsave them there.\n\n198\n00:12:16.714 --> 00:12:21.182\nPretty neat, so\nI'm going to clear everyone's votes and\n\n199\n00:12:21.182 --> 00:12:27.700\nI can stop sharing that particular poll\nand so they're not going to see it.\n\n200\n00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.268\nAnd if I wanted to create more polls for\n\n201\n00:12:30.268 --> 00:12:35.002\nthem like what is your favorite ice cream,\nI can come back into here and\n\n202\n00:12:35.002 --> 00:12:38.948\nI can go into the more button,\nadd another poll question.\n\n203\n00:12:38.948 --> 00:12:45.128\nLike maybe just really quickly,\nI could say ice cream and\n\n204\n00:12:45.128 --> 00:12:50.278\nthen we can say vanilla,\nchocolate, right and\n\n205\n00:12:50.278 --> 00:12:55.580\ncookies and cream, yes,\ncuz that's a fun one.\n\n206\n00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.507\nSo I'll create it, so\nyou can see that and again,\n\n207\n00:12:58.507 --> 00:13:02.203\npre making these polls might be\na little bit easier for you, but\n\n208\n00:13:02.203 --> 00:13:07.121\nif they're quick ones and you wanna just\nkind of throw them in, that might be nice.\n\n209\n00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:12.457\nAnd you can see that we've got some\nanswers coming in, wow, look at that 333.\n\n210\n00:13:12.457 --> 00:13:18.135\nAnd then we can close it, show the results\nwe can, take the snap shot of it,\n\n211\n00:13:18.135 --> 00:13:21.940\nsave the picture and\nall of that wonderful stuff.\n\n212\n00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.070\nSo you can see some really great ways and\n\n213\n00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:28.455\npretty simple I would say,\nways to keep your audience engaged.\n\n214\n00:13:28.455 --> 00:13:31.960\nIt's really just remembering all\nthose buttons down there and\n\n215\n00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:37.290\ncontrolling them in the right place and\njust keeping your mind intact of,\n\n216\n00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:41.950\ngot to open it, hide the results, clear\nit, bring up another one because I could\n\n217\n00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:46.160\nalways pull up the other\nquestion if I needed to.\n\n218\n00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.685\nBy going into my managed content and\nsharing the other poll that we have.\n\n219\n00:13:51.685 --> 00:13:56.374\nSo those are just some of the different\nways that we can do things and\n\n220\n00:13:56.374 --> 00:14:00.898\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nstop sharing that because that is showing\n\n221\n00:14:00.898 --> 00:14:04.790\neverything of conducting\na pole as an organizer.\n\n222\n00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.730\nAnd so, that's where we're\ngoing to switch over and\n\n223\n00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:12.350\nwe're going to show you how to\ndo everything as an attendee.\n\n224\n00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:19.460\nSo now we're ready to go ahead and\ntake a look at us being an attendee\n\n225\n00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.520\ninto a meeting and\nI can see the poll results and\n\n226\n00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.710\nall the stuff that I showed you as\nan organizer, we're gonna flip it on over.\n\n227\n00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.590\nSo why don't we jump on down.\n\n228\n00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:33.970\nJoey is already into a meeting\nthat is conducted by Justin.\n\n229\n00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.597\nNow I know that,\nwell because I helped set it up.\n\n230\n00:14:36.597 --> 00:14:41.437\nThe other thing is as an attendee I\ncan come over here to the Participants\n\n231\n00:14:41.437 --> 00:14:45.727\npane and I can see, yep,\nI'm an attendee with Joey and Renee.\n\n232\n00:14:45.727 --> 00:14:49.310\nAnd so that's where I know that\neverything is going all right.\n\n233\n00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.775\nI can see we've got a chat going on and\n\n234\n00:14:51.775 --> 00:14:56.360\nI told JT that he did a great job\nat our dance rehearsal last night.\n\n235\n00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.770\nAnd so I can see that I think Justin\nis gonna be pulling up a poll for\n\n236\n00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:02.000\nus in just a second.\n\n237\n00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.416\nAll right, wonderful.\n\n238\n00:15:03.416 --> 00:15:05.730\nLet's go ahead and take this poll.\n\n239\n00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:10.450\nI'm just waiting on the stage cuz I can't\nreally change anything in here, I can't\n\n240\n00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:15.790\nclick on anything just yet, so\nI'm going to see it in just one moment.\n\n241\n00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.080\nThere it is.\n\n242\n00:15:19.464 --> 00:15:23.123\nLook at that JT.\n\n243\n00:15:23.123 --> 00:15:31.210\n[LAUGH] So let's see, I think I might\nhave to pick that one, possibly.\n\n244\n00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.630\nWe'll go ahead and see that.\n\n245\n00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.550\nI can see that the poll\nis open right now and\n\n246\n00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.205\nthat we're just waiting for\nother people to respond.\n\n247\n00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:42.826\nOr I really just like the meeting\norganizer to go ahead and\n\n248\n00:15:42.826 --> 00:15:47.738\nchoose when he's going to go ahead and\nclose that poll down so we can see that.\n\n249\n00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:50.220\nAll right, you have ten seconds.\n\n250\n00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:54.870\nGood see, again good communication\nby the meeting organizer.\n\n251\n00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.510\nProbably be doing a lot\nof this through audio and\n\n252\n00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:01.378\nthen we're ready to go and we're done.\n\n253\n00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:05.960\n[LAUGH] So they can see that the poll\nis going to be closed, yep, so\n\n254\n00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.350\nI can't answer any of the questions,\nI can't click on them.\n\n255\n00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.110\nRight, so let's go ahead and\nsee the results.\n\n256\n00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:17.450\nMaybe, there we go, yes.\n\n257\n00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:19.670\nDefinitely the best answer.\n\n258\n00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:27.490\nI don't know, you know the NKTOB you know,\nNew Kids on the Block, wait, NKOTB.\n\n259\n00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:28.096\n&gt;&gt; You got me.\n\n260\n00:16:28.096 --> 00:16:30.510\nI'd look them up.\n\n261\n00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:31.959\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n262\n00:16:31.959 --> 00:16:37.883\n[LAUGH] Boyz II Men, that's a pretty good\none too, were they a boy band though?\n\n263\n00:16:37.883 --> 00:16:39.129\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\n\n264\n00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:40.595\nI'm not sure I would consider-.\n\n265\n00:16:40.595 --> 00:16:42.186\n&gt;&gt; No boys.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n266\n00:16:42.186 --> 00:16:43.332\n&gt;&gt; Boys to Men.\n\n267\n00:16:43.332 --> 00:16:45.697\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if I would\nactually consider them that.\n\n268\n00:16:45.697 --> 00:16:46.199\nBut you know what?\n\n269\n00:16:46.199 --> 00:16:49.875\nI'll go with it because this\nis all part of my childhood.\n\n270\n00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:54.815\nMaybe Backstreet Boys is a little\nfurther past mine, but that's okay.\n\n271\n00:16:54.815 --> 00:16:56.095\nWe're not gonna talk about our age.\n\n272\n00:16:56.095 --> 00:16:59.820\nAll right, so I could see that\nwe've got the result of the poll.\n\n273\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:05.190\nAnd that's where you'll see what they're\ngoing to be seeing on the attendee side.\n\n274\n00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:10.620\nI feel somewhat self explanatory if\nyou close it, they'll see it's closed,\n\n275\n00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:14.790\nif you show the results, they'll see\nthe results, if you clear the answers\n\n276\n00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.340\nthey will see that you've cleared\nthe answers, down on there.\n\n277\n00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.760\nYep, I can see that.\n\n278\n00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.400\nI can see when the poll's going\nto be opened back up again, for\n\n279\n00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.925\nus to go ahead and\nmaybe take another vote.\n\n280\n00:17:25.925 --> 00:17:31.141\nIt´s definitely gonna be in sync again,\nso we can see the results.\n\n281\n00:17:31.141 --> 00:17:36.160\nAnd actually, the poll results\nare still open, aren´t they?\n\n282\n00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.535\nYeah, I did the same thing.\n\n283\n00:17:37.535 --> 00:17:42.760\n[LAUGH] But things will keep\ncontrolling as you want to go through.\n\n284\n00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:47.700\nSo that's pretty much about it\nwith the polls, great way to keep\n\n285\n00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:52.350\nyour audience engaged, kinda throw some\nthings in there, throw some fun questions.\n\n286\n00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.620\nYou know keep it light and fun,\nyou know that's how we like to do it.\n\n287\n00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:01.880\nSo maybe you can try to inject a little\nOfficeProTV, ITProTV humor and\n\n288\n00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.950\ntake a page from our notebook and\nthrow a question about boy bands in there.\n\n289\n00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:06.777\nSo [LAUGH].\n\n290\n00:18:06.777 --> 00:18:08.564\n&gt;&gt; In other words, be self-serving,\nis that what you're saying?\n\n291\n00:18:08.564 --> 00:18:09.073\nNo.\n\n292\n00:18:09.073 --> 00:18:11.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here we go as we start to take a look\n\n293\n00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.580\nat the idea of using polls.\n\n294\n00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:18.530\nThey can be used to help, be able to\ngather a lot of people's opinions\n\n295\n00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.090\nvery quickly about a particular topic,\nof course.\n\n296\n00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:26.000\nOr if you're actually trying to find\na direction to go and you want to be\n\n297\n00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.140\na little bit more democratic about it,\npolls are a great way to help you out.\n\n298\n00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.910\nIt doesn't show you exactly\nwho said what right, so\n\n299\n00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:37.500\nthat way you do have this nice thing that\ngives you an honest answer at that point.\n\n300\n00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:41.770\nDo you believe this policy that we\njust set last week, is a fair policy,\n\n301\n00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.750\nthat might be something that we have\nto think about, but is a great way for\n\n302\n00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:45.920\nan answer to come across.\n\n303\n00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.657\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's actually, I'm glad you\npointed that out there Ronnie because I\n\n304\n00:18:49.657 --> 00:18:53.756\nfailed to mention that, so I'm glad that\nyou saw that, yeah, anonymous responses.\n\n305\n00:18:53.756 --> 00:18:58.880\nYou get those honest answers that people\nmight not be wanting to put in the chat.\n\n306\n00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.590\nSo definitely great way to do that.\n\n307\n00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:05.320\nI'm so glad that you went ahead and\npointed that out for me.\n\n308\n00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.217\nTeam work, team work here right?\n\n309\n00:19:06.217 --> 00:19:08.816\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; True, there's no doubt,\n\n310\n00:19:08.816 --> 00:19:11.670\ngood team work actually does\nlead to a great show as well.\n\n311\n00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.490\nSo this is a great place for\nus to also sign off.\n\n312\n00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:18.250\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n313\n00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.230\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n314\n00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:21.753\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of Skype for Business
