Yeah, I'm thrilled.\n\n10\n00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.490\nIt's really a pleasure to be here and\n\n11\n00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.990\nI'm so happy you've invited me to share\nwhat I know about social engineering.\n\n12\n00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.460\n&gt;&gt; Well, we couldn't be more\npleased to have you in the studio.\n\n13\n00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.540\nI guess, just really quickly,\nthis isn't your first rodeo,\n\n14\n00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.330\nI'm sure you've got a little\nexperience in this.\n\n15\n00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.650\nWhy don't you tell the audience\njust a bit about yourself?\n\n16\n00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.185\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, I'm an IT pro,\nI run my own company, and\n\n17\n00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:57.836\nI'm also what you call an ethical hacker.\n\n18\n00:00:57.836 --> 00:01:03.230\nI'm a EC-Council instructor, and\n\n19\n00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.440\nI think the elements of social engineering\nin the Certified Ethical Hacker program\n\n20\n00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.030\nleft a little bit to be designed and\nto really enhance it, and\n\n21\n00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.160\nhence is what we have here,\nis an enhancement of that subject.\n\n22\n00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.330\n&gt;&gt; Well, like I said, we're really\nlooking forward to this series.\n\n23\n00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.400\nSo that being said, I guess we should\njust hit the ground running and\n\n24\n00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.724\nstart with, we're going into the history\nand introduction of social engineering.\n\n25\n00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:38.292\n&gt;&gt; That's right, right, so actually,\nsocial engineering is over 100 years old,\n\n26\n00:01:38.292 --> 00:01:42.280\ngoing back to the development\nof social sciences.\n\n27\n00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.480\nThe term was coined back\nin the late 1800s by,\n\n28\n00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.390\nI'm gonna flip up a really\ncool picture here.\n\n29\n00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.935\nSo, social engineering was actually coined\nby this gentleman here, Ferdinand TÃ¶nnies.\n\n30\n00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.500\nFerdinand saw that he could develop\na data-based scientific system.\n\n31\n00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.350\nIn fact, I'll throw it up here.\n\n32\n00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.280\nTo develop a sustainable design, so\n\n33\n00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.810\nto achieve the intelligent management of\nEarth's resources and human capital with\n\n34\n00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.890\nthe highest levels of freedom, prosperity,\nand happiness within a population.\n\n35\n00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.552\nI mean,\nthat's a very positive intention to do.\n\n36\n00:02:26.552 --> 00:02:30.370\nMany people have actually\nutilized the principle.\n\n37\n00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.479\nAnd we find that actually\nit's used generally\n\n38\n00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:41.243\nin totalitarian governments\nsuch as 20s in Russia\n\n39\n00:02:41.243 --> 00:02:47.793\nin the developing of the Soviet man,\nthey coined the term.\n\n40\n00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:52.682\nGoing back to even China in the 50s and\n\n41\n00:02:52.682 --> 00:02:55.950\n60s, the Gang of Four.\n\n42\n00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.350\nWe see social engineering applied\nin all levels in society.\n\n43\n00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.810\nSo hence, the term, I think has been\npicked up really by the IT group.\n\n44\n00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.231\nAnd we look at it really in\nterms of ethical hacking,\n\n45\n00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:16.162\nas a form of manipulating\npeople into divulging\n\n46\n00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:21.000\ninformation that they do or\ndo not know about.\n\n47\n00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.340\nIn fact,\nhere I threw up an actual definition.\n\n48\n00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.700\nSo psychological manipulation of\npeople into performing actions or\n\n49\n00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.180\ndivulging confidential information.\n\n50\n00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.764\nInteresting thing is that\nit differs from a con\n\n51\n00:03:35.764 --> 00:03:40.004\nbecause it's only one of a larger scheme.\n\n52\n00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:45.031\n&gt;&gt; I gotcha, so\nthis more of a pointed type of con,\n\n53\n00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:47.065\nnot cons\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n54\n00:03:47.065 --> 00:03:49.813\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna socially engineer to give\n\n55\n00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:53.366\nyourself in the door to get\nsomething into a server so\n\n56\n00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.869\nthat then you can scan the network and\n\n57\n00:03:55.869 --> 00:04:01.380\nthen find pertinent information to\nexfiltrate data and proprietary secrets.\n\n58\n00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.627\n&gt;&gt; It's so funny to me that the first\ndefinition we see is something very\n\n59\n00:04:05.627 --> 00:04:09.362\naltruistic, very good for\nhumanity, and now, of course,\n\n60\n00:04:09.362 --> 00:04:12.748\nleave it to the tech guys to\nturn it into something bad.\n\n61\n00:04:12.748 --> 00:04:16.893\n&gt;&gt; It's always a kind of yin and\nyang, but still,\n\n62\n00:04:16.893 --> 00:04:21.360\nsociologists still look at\nit on a larger context.\n\n63\n00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.820\nInformation technologists tend to\nlook at it on the manipulation level.\n\n64\n00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.514\nAnd really, it depends, if we're gonna\ncall it manipulation or influence,\n\n65\n00:04:32.514 --> 00:04:35.512\nthen it depends really on\nthe intent behind that.\n\n66\n00:04:35.512 --> 00:04:41.891\nSo you may ask me what this\ncourse can accomplish.\n\n67\n00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:45.121\n&gt;&gt; Right, so now that we know\nwhat social engineering is,\n\n68\n00:04:45.121 --> 00:04:47.334\nwhat can we do with that information?\n\n69\n00:04:47.334 --> 00:04:52.103\n&gt;&gt; Well, we want to try and increase our\nawareness about what social engineering\n\n70\n00:04:52.103 --> 00:04:57.900\nactually is and how it's operated and\nhow people are influenced or manipulated.\n\n71\n00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.010\nSo some of the aspects of it are, first\nis, we're gonna talk about elicitation.\n\n72\n00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.400\nAll right, so elicitation is the act or\n\n73\n00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.540\nthe art of getting people\nto divulge information.\n\n74\n00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.074\nAnd say you go to even a bar or\nyour restaurant or\n\n75\n00:05:16.074 --> 00:05:20.958\nyour conference,\nyou meet people, you elicit,\n\n76\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:26.309\nusually at the beginning\nof a conversation, you say,\n\n77\n00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:31.104\nhey, how are you doing,\nwhere are you from?\n\n78\n00:05:31.104 --> 00:05:31.810\nReally.\n\n79\n00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.550\nAnd then we kind of utilize some of the\nprinciples of influence there by saying,\n\n80\n00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.870\nhey, we're kind of alike,\ncuz I'm actually from the same area or\n\n81\n00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.360\nI have a cousin that's from there.\n\n82\n00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.180\nAnd everybody from that town is really\nawesome, yeah, they're great people,\n\n83\n00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.880\nwe really love them.\n\n84\n00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.740\nSo elicitation and\n\n85\n00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.360\ninfluence are kinda closely tied together,\nbut yet\n\n86\n00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.870\ninfluence is the art of actually\nopening that person up.\n\n87\n00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.450\nElicitation is the extracting of\ninformation from them for positive or\n\n88\n00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.160\nnegative reasons.\n\n89\n00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.010\nI mean, you go to the doctor, the doctor\nwants to know how you're feeling, okay,\n\n90\n00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.380\nand what's your blood pressure like?\n\n91\n00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.540\nThey have to get information from you in\norder to see how the system's working.\n\n92\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.730\nSo elicitation really tells us\nthe balance and health of where we're at.\n\n93\n00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.469\n&gt;&gt; So it's really taking the idea of\nknowledge is power to the nth degree and\n\n94\n00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:25.580\nsaying, now that I have knowledge,\nI can have some power.\n\n95\n00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.330\n&gt;&gt; Sure, sure, as social engineers,\nwe want to be able to do tests to see\n\n96\n00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:38.330\nif we can elicitate information to see if,\nin a sense, loose lips might sink ships.\n\n97\n00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.940\nWhich is kind of interesting,\neven our own government has had a program\n\n98\n00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.540\nback toward the II World War,\nnot that they haven't had other programs,\n\n99\n00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.710\nbut this program was actually effective\nin keeping both the Japanese and\n\n100\n00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.510\nthe Nazis from getting our top secrets.\n\n101\n00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.810\nKnowing what kind of ships we're building,\nwhat kind of tanks,\n\n102\n00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.350\nwhat kind of weapons we're working on.\n\n103\n00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.770\nSo anybody that worked in a weapons\nplant or worked in a ship building yard,\n\n104\n00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:12.190\nin a tank building plant,\nwere told to keep their lips quiet.\n\n105\n00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.340\nAnd this campaign worked well.\n\n106\n00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.499\nAnd we're really seeing that, okay,\nso we didn't have the kind of digital\n\n107\n00:07:19.499 --> 00:07:24.550\ncommunication that we have now, but\nwe certainly did have television.\n\n108\n00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.750\nWe certainly had newspapers, print, and\n\n109\n00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.408\npublic meetings, public posters,\nstuff like that.\n\n110\n00:07:32.408 --> 00:07:37.290\n&gt;&gt; Tom, it seems interesting to me to\nthink that so we've got this World War II\n\n111\n00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.265\npropaganda poster and it's telling us,\nLoose Lips Might Sink Ships, right.\n\n112\n00:07:41.265 --> 00:07:46.233\nAnd what it's telling us is, you should\nbe afraid of talking about information\n\n113\n00:07:46.233 --> 00:07:51.218\nabout your job, cuz you might be a dock\nworker, you might be a clerk somewhere.\n\n114\n00:07:51.218 --> 00:07:55.373\nAnd any information you give out could\npotentially be a spy that you're speaking\n\n115\n00:07:55.373 --> 00:07:57.584\nto and that information goes to the enemy.\n\n116\n00:07:57.584 --> 00:07:59.846\nAnd because of that,\nAmerican lives are lost.\n\n117\n00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:03.091\nAnd it was a great, a bit of propaganda.\n\n118\n00:08:03.091 --> 00:08:05.390\nIt worked very well,\nthe campaign was fantastic.\n\n119\n00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.690\nWe were just talking about that.\n\n120\n00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.850\nBut what's interesting to me, is it seems\nthat, it's a type of social engineering.\n\n121\n00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:15.360\nAnd we're using social engineering,\nas the remediation for social engineering.\n\n122\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.312\n&gt;&gt; Isn't that something?\n\n123\n00:08:16.312 --> 00:08:18.708\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Funny.\n&gt;&gt; But yet really, you figure,\n\n124\n00:08:18.708 --> 00:08:24.593\nlet's say you have users who don't really\npay attention to what they're clicking on.\n\n125\n00:08:24.593 --> 00:08:27.329\nHow are you going to get them to behave?\n\n126\n00:08:27.329 --> 00:08:31.745\nWe're gonna socially engineer them, so\neither to some type of training but\n\n127\n00:08:31.745 --> 00:08:33.826\nwhat type of training should we do?\n\n128\n00:08:33.826 --> 00:08:36.397\nAs we go further and\ndeeper into the course,\n\n129\n00:08:36.397 --> 00:08:39.601\nwe'll find as we get into\npsychological components.\n\n130\n00:08:39.601 --> 00:08:44.457\nExactly how we're going to manipulate the\ntypes of personalities into complying and\n\n131\n00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:47.120\ndoing the things that we need them to do.\n\n132\n00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.410\n&gt;&gt; Fascinating, that's fascinating.\n\n133\n00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:49.730\nAll right so what are we doing next?\n\n134\n00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.380\n&gt;&gt; So sometimes the social\nengineer gets social engineered.\n\n135\n00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the backfire, right,\n\n136\n00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.630\nthat's the opposite of\nwhat they want I think.\n\n137\n00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:00.866\nWell, so let's state a fact,\n\n138\n00:09:00.866 --> 00:09:05.600\nthe human element is\nthe weakest link in the chain.\n\n139\n00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.680\nAll right, there's no-\n&gt;&gt; There's no patch for instability right?\n\n140\n00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:13.170\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes we call it the layer eight\nif you're into the whole OSI structure.\n\n141\n00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:17.440\nCertainly layer eight is\nthe area that we're after that.\n\n142\n00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.664\nNot only do we wanna test\nthat this is really where all\n\n143\n00:09:21.664 --> 00:09:24.454\nthe information gets licked out.\n\n144\n00:09:24.454 --> 00:09:29.552\nBut really we also need to\nconsider the compliance.\n\n145\n00:09:29.552 --> 00:09:34.623\nWe're restricted and forced through\n\n146\n00:09:34.623 --> 00:09:41.850\ncompliance to have policies\nthat have computer use.\n\n147\n00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:49.390\nRestrict access to certain points, that\nshould data be leaked out that shouldn't,\n\n148\n00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:54.490\nyou're going to have to face penalties and\nfines for that.\n\n149\n00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:59.740\nSo we need to, from there,\nunderstand really where our\n\n150\n00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:05.650\nbaseline of security and stability is.\n\n151\n00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:09.370\nWhere our self defense posture or\ncyber security posture is.\n\n152\n00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.386\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nagain this is on both sides of the fence.\n\n153\n00:10:11.386 --> 00:10:14.470\nYou have the malicious social engineerer,\n\n154\n00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.147\nthat is attempting to\nillicit these informations.\n\n155\n00:10:18.147 --> 00:10:21.246\nThey have to find out what\nare there compliance,\n\n156\n00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:24.055\nwhat dictates compliance for this system.\n\n157\n00:10:24.055 --> 00:10:27.427\nSo that I know where the weaknesses are,\nwhere the holes are.\n\n158\n00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:30.467\nAnd then also,\nI'm gonna create a baseline and\n\n159\n00:10:30.467 --> 00:10:33.287\nsee how well that\ncompliance is vetted out.\n\n160\n00:10:33.287 --> 00:10:37.478\nAnd of course on our end of the fence,\nwhere we are implementing compliance and\n\n161\n00:10:37.478 --> 00:10:39.012\ncreating a baseline to see.\n\n162\n00:10:39.012 --> 00:10:42.992\nWhere is that working, where is it not\nworking, we need to maybe adjust things.\n\n163\n00:10:42.992 --> 00:10:47.800\nSo we're both doing the exact same thing,\nfighting for a different reason though.\n\n164\n00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.764\n&gt;&gt; Different reason, sure.\n\n165\n00:10:49.764 --> 00:10:52.764\nThose incentives are kind of interesting.\n\n166\n00:10:52.764 --> 00:11:00.116\nCertainly then we'll move into\nthe psychological component.\n\n167\n00:11:00.116 --> 00:11:04.894\nIn fact the authority, the expert on that,\n\n168\n00:11:04.894 --> 00:11:08.767\nis a man by the name of Cialdini, and\n\n169\n00:11:08.767 --> 00:11:12.525\nhe wrote a book called Influence.\n\n170\n00:11:12.525 --> 00:11:17.584\nWhich not only will I use, but\nI find that anybody that's has written or\n\n171\n00:11:17.584 --> 00:11:21.644\ndone anything in social\nengineering tends to quote him.\n\n172\n00:11:21.644 --> 00:11:26.604\nBecause the concepts are actually\nvery real and as we see them,\n\n173\n00:11:26.604 --> 00:11:30.169\nwe're gonna see that they make sense for\nus.\n\n174\n00:11:30.169 --> 00:11:34.730\nSo we have what we call\nnatural social influencers.\n\n175\n00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:39.043\nAnd the best understand\nhow to socially influence,\n\n176\n00:11:39.043 --> 00:11:43.320\nis to reverse engineer the natural ones.\n\n177\n00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:48.740\nAnd now, we put together a little\nvignette, an animated video,\n\n178\n00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.270\nand Peter was so great at this.\n\n179\n00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.920\nI can't believe he actually did the voices\nand everything on these things again.\n\n180\n00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.694\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n181\n00:11:56.694 --> 00:12:01.584\nwe like to roll that at this time and.\n\n182\n00:12:01.584 --> 00:12:11.584\n&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN]\n\n183\n00:12:22.107 --> 00:12:28.940\n&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]\n\n184\n00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.316\n&gt;&gt; I thank you in the name of the most\n\n185\n00:12:31.316 --> 00:12:33.611\nancient in the world.\n\n186\n00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:37.068\nI thank you in the name of\nthe mother of religions.\n\n187\n00:12:37.068 --> 00:12:41.036\nAnd I thank you in the name\nof the millions and\n\n188\n00:12:41.036 --> 00:12:45.763\nmillions of Hindu people\nof all classes and faiths.\n\n189\n00:12:45.763 --> 00:12:49.347\n&gt;&gt; Someone had me very busy,\nneeded to talk to me about something, so\n\n190\n00:12:49.347 --> 00:12:52.940\nI just went to the drawer and\npicked out pair of shorts and put it on.\n\n191\n00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.880\nAnd they had the needle fixed with\nsome poison on the end of it.\n\n192\n00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:02.630\nSo that we just touched the and\nI knew right then what someone was up to.\n\n193\n00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:05.355\nBut I want you to know\nI've not been off my feet.\n\n194\n00:13:05.355 --> 00:13:07.955\n&gt;&gt;

No, no Timmy, sorry, but no can do.\n\n228\n00:14:44.805 --> 00:14:51.017\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] I must be adopted.\n\n229\n00:14:51.017 --> 00:14:54.320\nNobody loves me, everyone else has one.\n\n230\n00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.587\n&gt;&gt; For God sakes, one of those Happy Meals\nwith the Skylander car, please?\n\n231\n00:14:59.587 --> 00:15:04.579\n&gt;&gt; Wow, you're the best dad in the world.\n\n232\n00:15:04.579 --> 00:15:08.159\nWell, a lot of natural social\nengineering going on there,\n\n233\n00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:11.105\ndifferent stereotypes of\nthose types of forms.\n\n234\n00:15:11.105 --> 00:15:14.593\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, an interesting thing is,\n\n235\n00:15:14.593 --> 00:15:18.631\nafter you go through\nall the entire course.\n\n236\n00:15:18.631 --> 00:15:23.452\nWant you to come back to this\nadditional video, and see if you can\n\n237\n00:15:23.452 --> 00:15:28.290\nidentify all the psychological\nprinciples that went through.\n\n238\n00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.850\nBecause they're laced all through this.\n\n239\n00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:37.980\nBut certainly we see here politicians,\nreligious leaders.\n\n240\n00:15:43.966 --> 00:15:48.138\nYou and me, I don't know if you've\nidentified in there, it was actually\n\n241\n00:15:48.138 --> 00:15:52.085\nJimmy Jones from the Jonestown,\nit was actually Jimmy Jones voice.\n\n242\n00:15:52.085 --> 00:15:54.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That it was taken,\n\n243\n00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.453\njust a clip we picked out.\n\n244\n00:15:56.453 --> 00:15:59.461\nI don't know if it made\nsense to everybody but-\n\n245\n00:15:59.461 --> 00:16:00.213\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n246\n00:16:00.213 --> 00:16:01.933\n&gt;&gt; My wife said anybody even remember\n\n247\n00:16:01.933 --> 00:16:04.813\nthe Jonestown massacre\n&gt;&gt; I hope so.\n\n248\n00:16:04.813 --> 00:16:07.593\n&gt;&gt; It's funny,\nI guess if you don't remember history,\n\n249\n00:16:07.593 --> 00:16:09.110\nhistory will repeat itself.\n\n250\n00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:10.790\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\nWas that really Jim Jones' voice?\n\n251\n00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:11.750\n&gt;&gt; That was his voice, yeah.\n\n252\n00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:16.390\nThat was a bit, I think it was\nprior to the whole senator killing.\n\n253\n00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:19.750\nHe thought he was pretty paranoid.\n\n254\n00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.810\nSo, I may be one of these what we call,\nan erotic type.\n\n255\n00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.092\nThe car salesman.\n\n256\n00:16:27.092 --> 00:16:28.385\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we've all been there, that guy.\n\n257\n00:16:28.385 --> 00:16:29.546\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] yeah, it's great.\n\n258\n00:16:29.546 --> 00:16:36.530\nAnd he pulled off, as well as the rest,\nthe deal with the Happy Meal.\n\n259\n00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:37.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI know it's funny.\n\n260\n00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.750\nI have to admit I was a car\nsalesman at one time,\n\n261\n00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.065\nso I know all their little tricks.\n\n262\n00:16:43.065 --> 00:16:44.510\n&gt;&gt; Hey, you know we need to buy a car.\n\n263\n00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:49.050\nAnd I've bought, actually,\nI really enjoy a good salesperson.\n\n264\n00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:49.640\n&gt;&gt; I do, too.\n\n265\n00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.380\nIt's an art.\n&gt;&gt; It's an art.\n\n266\n00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.744\n&gt;&gt; It normally is.\nI've seen good salesman and bad ones.\n\n267\n00:16:52.744 --> 00:16:57.880\n&gt;&gt; If that person walks\naway feeling enabled and\n\n268\n00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.870\nthat they've got a great deal,\nthen that person did their job.\n\n269\n00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.710\nSomebody has to sell it to you.\n\n270\n00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:09.720\nBut what we do have are,\ncertainly salespeople,\n\n271\n00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.252\nare one of the natural influencers.\n\n272\n00:17:12.252 --> 00:17:16.540\nSo if we're going to\nunderstand social engineering,\n\n273\n00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.704\nit's good to look the naturals in it.\n\n274\n00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:23.410\nSo, sales, I guess all salespeople\nare natural, but people that\n\n275\n00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:28.470\ntend to stay in sales and be successful\nin sales are more natural at it.\n\n276\n00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:29.280\n&gt;&gt; Sure, I see.\n\n277\n00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.990\n&gt;&gt; So, if you're not selling things,\nyou're not gonna be in the business long.\n\n278\n00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:34.360\n&gt;&gt; Why would I wanna be in the queue,\nright?\n\n279\n00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.920\n&gt;&gt; What are some of the characteristics-\n&gt;&gt; If you're not good.\n\n280\n00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.610\n&gt;&gt; of a good salesman?\n\n281\n00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:38.890\n&gt;&gt; They're likeable, right?\n\n282\n00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:39.670\n&gt;&gt; They're likeable.\n\n283\n00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:43.520\n&gt;&gt; They find common ground between\nthemselves and their, I guess,\n\n284\n00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.490\nclient, if you wanna call it.\n\n285\n00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:45.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n286\n00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.200\n&gt;&gt; The customer.\nThey find out what it is that you want,\n\n287\n00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.080\nand they try to fulfill that need for you\nin a way that you both walk away happy.\n\n288\n00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:52.720\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n289\n00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.640\nNow, in the video,\nHonest Bob did do a lot of talking.\n\n290\n00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n291\n00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:03.750\n&gt;&gt; And so, typically, a salesman\ntries to maybe talk 20% of the time,\n\n292\n00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:09.007\nand get his purchasee to\nmaybe talk 80% of the time\n\n293\n00:18:09.007 --> 00:18:13.428\nto really try to draw\nsomething out of them,\n\n294\n00:18:13.428 --> 00:18:18.230\nget them talking, and\nfind that information.\n\n295\n00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:24.500\nBut he was very clever in exactly how\nhe did bring that information out.\n\n296\n00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.010\nThey do sell themselves.\n\n297\n00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:31.710\nI mean they have to be likeable, and\nI think you hit on that point right there.\n\n298\n00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.150\nSome other things,\n\n299\n00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:38.800\nthey're great at asking questions,\nbut they ask the pertinent questions.\n\n300\n00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.815\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember in my car\nsalesmen training, they made us watch\n\n301\n00:18:41.815 --> 00:18:45.745\nall these different videos on sales\ntechniques and things of that nature and\n\n302\n00:18:45.745 --> 00:18:49.065\nhow to get the customer to\nbasically start talking to you.\n\n303\n00:18:49.065 --> 00:18:51.345\nLike you said, I want them to talk,\nbecause the more they talk,\n\n304\n00:18:51.345 --> 00:18:52.890\nthe more information I have.\n\n305\n00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.165\nAnd from that information,\n\n306\n00:18:54.165 --> 00:18:58.040\nI can steer them, no pun intended,\nto the right car, right?\n\n307\n00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.580\nSo, if somebody walks up on the lot,\nand I say, good morning.\n\n308\n00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:02.370\nHow are you doing today?\n\n309\n00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:02.980\nCan I help you?\n\n310\n00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.405\nAnd they say, no, I'm just looking.\n\n311\n00:19:05.405 --> 00:19:06.800\nIt's their favorite line, right?\n\n312\n00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.710\nEveryone says I'm just looking.\n\n313\n00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:09.970\nGreat, are you looking for a car?\n\n314\n00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:10.930\nA truck?\nDo you want red?\n\n315\n00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:12.980\nBlue?\nBlack?\n\n316\n00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.550\nWell, you know I need a truck for\nmy job here.\n\n317\n00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:17.770\nI gotta have something\nI can tow things with.\n\n318\n00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:21.320\nPerfect, do you like black or\nred, or blue's your color?\n\n319\n00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.681\nDo you think you wear blue very well?\n\n320\n00:19:22.681 --> 00:19:23.354\nYeah, I like blue.\n\n321\n00:19:23.354 --> 00:19:25.060\nLet's go look at these blue trucks.\n\n322\n00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.493\nAnd now, they're following you.\n\n323\n00:19:26.493 --> 00:19:29.360\nAnd then, also, they want you to\nget them to say yes to things.\n\n324\n00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.630\nIf I threw you a life-preserver,\nwould you take it?\n\n325\n00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.040\nWell, yeah, obviously,\nI would if I was drowning.\n\n326\n00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.470\nOkay, well,\nI'm throwing you a life-preserver.\n\n327\n00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.980\nThis is the best deal you're gonna find\non this truck anywhere in this city.\n\n328\n00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.810\nWell, okay,\nif that's the best deal I can get.\n\n329\n00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.536\n&gt;&gt; Right, but we know today that also,\nthe way salespeople are,\n\n330\n00:19:46.536 --> 00:19:50.140\nthat they could be overpowering,\nand they'll turn us off.\n\n331\n00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.257\nA good salesperson knows that.\n\n332\n00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:58.020\nAnd a good salesperson will\nalways link the benefits of it.\n\n333\n00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.073\nThey wanna find those benefits and\n\n334\n00:20:00.073 --> 00:20:03.690\nthey're gonna then bring\nthe value to that benefit for you.\n\n335\n00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.687\n&gt;&gt; So they bring the value up so\nthat you become more [CROSSTALK].\n\n336\n00:20:06.687 --> 00:20:09.475\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and\nthat's part of what a good salesman is.\n\n337\n00:20:09.475 --> 00:20:13.760\nThey should be able to question you and\nfind out really what you need, and\n\n338\n00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.180\nsell you that,\nrather than features that you don't need.\n\n339\n00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it does seem like the social\nengineer does need to be knowledgeable,\n\n340\n00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:25.080\nat least in the thing that\nthey're trying to elicit.\n\n341\n00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.300\nSo if I was trying to talk to tech guys\nand get information out of tech guys,\n\n342\n00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.240\nI'd probably need to know\na little bit about tech so\n\n343\n00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.800\nthat I can gauge them on that level.\n\n344\n00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.690\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n345\n00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.131\nThey like to also sell the results, okay.\n\n346\n00:20:35.131 --> 00:20:36.660\nWon't you look good.\n\n347\n00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:43.340\nYou would look marvelous in that blue\npick-up that matches you so well.\n\n348\n00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.929\nYou would look so good.\n\n349\n00:20:45.929 --> 00:20:49.220\nSo, we could go on with sales.\n\n350\n00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:53.849\nThere are so many tricks, but\nI encourage everybody to actually\n\n351\n00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.720\nspend a little time looking\nat some of the sales tactics.\n\n352\n00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.660\nReally, do some sales,\n\n353\n00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:06.100\neven become an Amway distributor\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, get a part-time job, right?\n\n354\n00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, get a part-time job.\n\n355\n00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.250\nAnd that's really part\nof the goal of trading,\n\n356\n00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:14.589\nto put yourself in positions that\nmaybe you're not so comfortable with\n\n357\n00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:20.980\nto bring that out and\ndevelop these skills.\n\n358\n00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:24.840\n&gt;&gt; Well, Tom, who are some other\nnatural social influencers?\n\n359\n00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.940\n&gt;&gt; James Bond.\n\n360\n00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Jimmy Bond.\n\n361\n00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.550\n&gt;&gt; Spies.\n\n362\n00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.680\n&gt;&gt; Spies, I mean spies are the greatest.\n\n363\n00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.870\nI think we can learn a lot\nfrom even watching spy films.\n\n364\n00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.290\nThey are the greatest at pretexting.\n\n365\n00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.780\nThey know how to disguise.\n\n366\n00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.940\nBut they also know how to be covert.\n\n367\n00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.910\nThey know how to shoulder surf.\n\n368\n00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:48.400\nThey can read lips.\n\n369\n00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.095\nThey know how to listen.\n\n370\n00:21:52.095 --> 00:21:57.390\nThey'll get close to an air duct, so\nthat they can pick up on the conversation.\n\n371\n00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:04.500\nThey should be well-versed in spy tools,\nsuch as a spy pen,\n\n372\n00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:09.020\na spy camera, microphones, bugging.\n\n373\n00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.580\n&gt;&gt; Laser watches, obviously.\n\n374\n00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:11.080\n&gt;&gt; All these things, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n375\n00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.900\n&gt;&gt; Of course, of course.\n\n376\n00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.096\nExploding cigarettes.\n\n377\n00:22:14.096 --> 00:22:15.315\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n378\n00:22:15.315 --> 00:22:19.482\n&gt;&gt; But I think there is actually training\n\n379\n00:22:19.482 --> 00:22:20.970\nfor spies.\n\n380\n00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:24.926\nIt wouldn't hurt anybody to do that,\nat all.\n\n381\n00:22:24.926 --> 00:22:29.140\nI think another area is actors.\n\n382\n00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:37.600\nSo, we have a tremendous, tremendous.\n\n383\n00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.200\nA good actor who sucks you into the film,\n\n384\n00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:46.530\nyou forget about the staging,\nyou don't hear the background music,\n\n385\n00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:50.493\nand you're just kinda sitting there\nin awe, and the time goes by.\n\n386\n00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.410\nThat's a great social engineer.\n\n387\n00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:54.860\nAnd there are techniques in acting.\n\n388\n00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:58.190\nActually, I encourage anyone that\nreally wants to be a social engineer,\n\n389\n00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:00.820\ntake acting lessons.\n\n390\n00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:05.420\nIf you're gonna pretext, hey,\nyou gotta practice voices.\n\n391\n00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.830\nYou gotta practice mannerisms.\n\n392\n00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:12.820\nYou've got to learn how to make\nyourself a little smaller,\n\n393\n00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:18.890\nhow to stand taller, put you through\nall kinds of different positions, and\n\n394\n00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:24.730\nmotions, and attitudes, and\nteach you how to control your emotions,\n\n395\n00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:31.140\ncertainly, how to control your voice,\nhow to change your entire persona, okay.\n\n396\n00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.980\nCertainly, in acting,\nit involves costuming.\n\n397\n00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:40.820\nAnd we're gonna find that costume is gonna\nhave a big impact on the change of our\n\n398\n00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:47.478\nown personalities, simply by putting on a\ndifferent thing, like Halloween, in fact.\n\n399\n00:23:47.478 --> 00:23:53.491\nSo, the next group are con men,\ncon people, consters,\n\n400\n00:23:53.491 --> 00:23:59.380\ncon artists, probably the greatest,\nand typically,\n\n401\n00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:06.542\nthese are the people who have\ntagged into information technology.\n\n402\n00:24:06.542 --> 00:24:10.636\nBut, yet, there are con artists who have,\n\n403\n00:24:10.636 --> 00:24:16.279\nwithout ever using a phone,\nwithout ever using a computer,\n\n404\n00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:19.821\nhave been able to steal information,\n\n405\n00:24:19.821 --> 00:24:26.500\nsimply with a box of chocolates,\na friendly gesture, a smile.\n\n406\n00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:31.490\nJust smooths the way and\njust with charm alone, take millions and\n\n407\n00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:32.750\nmillions of dollars.\n\n408\n00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.769\nAnd so,\n&gt;&gt; Now what about someone like Kevin.\n\n409\n00:24:34.769 --> 00:24:38.463\nObviously he's probably one of\nthe most famous social engineers,\n\n410\n00:24:38.463 --> 00:24:43.022\nespecially in the realm of IT, what kind\nof social engineer would you label him as?\n\n411\n00:24:43.022 --> 00:24:45.616\n&gt;&gt; The best [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; He's the king.\n\n412\n00:24:45.616 --> 00:24:47.507\n&gt;&gt; He's got a great book, in fact,\n\n413\n00:24:47.507 --> 00:24:51.233\nwritten by Wiley along with\nthere's a social engineering book.\n\n414\n00:24:51.233 --> 00:25:00.500\nWe followed the framework Chris Adnaggi-\n&gt;&gt; Tongue Twister [LAUGH].\n\n415\n00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.790\n&gt;&gt; Excuse me, yeah.\n\n416\n00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:06.480\nChris Adnaggi has written a book called,\nSocio Engineering,\n\n417\n00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.160\nwhich is published by Wiley.\n\n418\n00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:13.960\nThere's a framework in that we\nkind of follow to a degree.\n\n419\n00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.110\nBecause why reinvent the wheel?\n\n420\n00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.990\nBut I take some different approaches,\ndifferent ideas.\n\n421\n00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:24.020\nAnd as we go along, you'll see that I\nbring, I lend, I probably didn't say\n\n422\n00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:28.122\nanything that I've got 50 years of\nmartial arts training under my belt.\n\n423\n00:25:28.122 --> 00:25:29.884\nAnd\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] That's all?\n\n424\n00:25:29.884 --> 00:25:32.960\n&gt;&gt; I was really trying to add some of\nthat, I try to add some of that into it.\n\n425\n00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:38.120\nSo, as we go along,\nwe'll see that the martial arts components\n\n426\n00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.810\nbring in a little bit of\na Bruce Lee Ji Quon Do into it,\n\n427\n00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:45.870\nand how his angles of taxes\napproach to changing martial arts.\n\n428\n00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:47.520\nAnd he really did change the face of it.\n\n429\n00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.310\nI can actually add to\nour social engineering.\n\n430\n00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.840\n&gt;&gt; It's going to be awesome.\n\n431\n00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.270\nTom is there anything\nelse we have to cover for\n\n432\n00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.290\ntoday's episode before\nwe close down the show?\n\n433\n00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:57.980\n&gt;&gt; No, I think we pretty well have it.\n\n434\n00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.040\nYou know?\n\n435\n00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.670\nSo, looks to me like I guess\nwe're getting down to the wire.\n\n436\n00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:04.550\nLet me look here at my voice.\n\n437\n00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:06.800\n&gt;&gt; You got one more?\n\n438\n00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.790\n&gt;&gt; Well, last group\n&gt;&gt; Last group?\n\n439\n00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.010\n&gt;&gt; Identity thieves.\n\n440\n00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:12.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah., yeah.\n\n441\n00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:16.550\n&gt;&gt; But identity thieves really\nfit under the area of consters.\n\n442\n00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.100\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like a sub section of\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, kind of like a sub section of\n\n443\n00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:24.010\nconsters, but there's some great,\nI'm just saying, there's some great\n\n444\n00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:28.830\nbooks out there on the con,\nhow they do it, magicians, another one.\n\n445\n00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:33.840\nMy nephew, Daniel White,\nis an awesome magician,\n\n446\n00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:39.230\ndone a couple really great specials on it,\nlike on The Nature Channel and stuff.\n\n447\n00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:44.610\nBut he always says really look,\nthere's the misdirection,\n\n448\n00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:50.150\nlook at this, there's the patter,\nthen there's the trick they pull off.\n\n449\n00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:55.100\n&gt;&gt; Maybe magic isn't your thing,\nbut it certainly can help you to\n\n450\n00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:02.270\ndevelop your ability\n\n451\n00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:07.010\nto enthrall people, to draw them in, to\n&gt;&gt; Keep them involved and\n\n452\n00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:08.230\ndevelop influence.\n\n453\n00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:15.620\nMagic really is a manipulation, but\nit really is an art of story telling.\n\n454\n00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:22.580\nBut yet\ngetting people to be misdirected in one\n\n455\n00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:26.820\nway while you're doing something else They\nnoticed the man behind the curtain, right?\n\n456\n00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.810\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n457\n00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.040\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff, Tom.\n\n458\n00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.650\nWell I know you do have, actually quite\na bit more when it comes to introduction\n\n459\n00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.780\nof social engineering,\nbut I am gonna talk.\n\n460\n00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:39.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll talk about some of\nthe current things going on as we return.\n\n461\n00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.730\n&gt;&gt; Well, in part two,\nwe'll get to look at that stuff,\n\n462\n00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:47.580\nbut our clock has dwindled down and\nwe need, we need to wrap this one up, so\n\n463\n00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.100\nI look forward to seeing you in part two.\n\n464\n00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.601\n&gt;&gt;

another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:18.100\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\n\n5\n00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.400\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our social engineering series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.570\nJoining us back in studio again today for\na Part Two on the introduction.\n\n7\n00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.180\nAnd maybe some of the history of social\nengineering, is our good friend,\n\n8\n00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.130\nour mentor on this foray,\nis Mr. Tom Updegrove.\n\n9\n00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.400\nTom, welcome back, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.070\nSo glad to have you again,\nand how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.385\n>> I'm excited to be here to\nactually take part in Part Two.\n\n12\n00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:43.895\nThat's the introduction.\n\n13\n00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:44.420\n>> The Quickening.\n\n14\n00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.365\n>> [LAUGH] That's cute.\n\n15\n00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:48.615\n>> In the previous episode we\nstarted really getting into some\n\n16\n00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:52.355\nof the history of what\nsocial engineering is and\n\n17\n00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:57.395\nhow it's been used and\nthe different ways and types of people.\n\n18\n00:00:57.395 --> 00:01:02.147\nAnd I think that is a pretty good place to\njump back into is the different types of\n\n19\n00:01:02.147 --> 00:01:05.020\nsocial influencers or social engineers.\n\n20\n00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.210\nSure.\nAnd, hey,\n\n21\n00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.060\nthe first group that we wanna really\ntalk about is hackers and crackers.\n\n22\n00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.860\nWhat's the difference?\n\n23\n00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.040\n>> That's a good question.\n\n24\n00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.600\n>> Well, it's interesting because there's\n\n25\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.420\nan RFC of 2828 which defines a hacker\nas somebody who figures things out.\n\n26\n00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.460\nAnd make something cool happen.\n\n27\n00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.283\n>> That's a perfect definition [CROSSTALK]\n>> I think a hacker actually it's\n\n28\n00:01:31.283 --> 00:01:32.830\na mentality.\n\n29\n00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.320\nIt's really a state of mind.\n\n30\n00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.375\nIt's people who like like\nto figure things out,\n\n31\n00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:43.325\nversus a cracker in Cisco,\nactually made this definition.\n\n32\n00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:46.875\nThis division between the two, years back,\n\n33\n00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:52.715\nbecause crackers are people who are,\nin an illegal way,\n\n34\n00:01:53.775 --> 00:01:59.175\ntrying to break into systems,\ntrying to steal money,\n\n35\n00:01:59.175 --> 00:02:03.312\nto illicit information and so on.\n\n36\n00:02:03.312 --> 00:02:09.130\nOne of our next groups\nI think is salesmen.\n\n37\n00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.190\nI think anybody who wants to\nbe a good social engineer\n\n38\n00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.100\nshould spend some time being\na vacuum cleaner salesman okay.\n\n39\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.200\nOr any type of salesman.\n\n40\n00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.940\n>> I see what you did there.\n\n41\n00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.998\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because I use to sell vacuum cleaners.\n\n42\n00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:25.776\nThis guy.\n\n43\n00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:31.493\n[LAUGH] I think it's a great\nway to get a start at it,\n\n44\n00:02:31.493 --> 00:02:36.830\neven if you become\na Herbalife sales person.\n\n45\n00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.110\nOr run a Tupperware party.\n\n46\n00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.680\nit's a great way to practice\nall of your techniques\n\n47\n00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.535\nwithout going straight into the field.\n\n48\n00:02:46.535 --> 00:02:47.930\n>> And if you think of it,\n\n49\n00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.730\nsales seems to be, as long as you're doing\nit correctly and not one of those people,\n\n50\n00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.580\nlike I knew a guy that when I sold cars,\nhe said, I go for the jugular.\n\n51\n00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.580\nThat kinda guy.\n\n52\n00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.660\nBut the normal person is just saying,\nyou know what, this is my job,\n\n53\n00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.330\nI'm a salesperson.\n\n54\n00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.930\nI'm trying to connect someone with a good\nproduct that I think is worthy of selling\n\n55\n00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.310\nand buying, is it's a type of\nethical social engineering.\n\n56\n00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.740\nI want you to buy\n\n57\n00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.800\nthis vacuum cleaner because I think it's\nthe best vacuum cleaner on the market.\n\n58\n00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.080\nAnd I can give you a litany of reasons\nwhy and I'm trying to influence you\n\n59\n00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.070\nto understand those reasons so\nthat you will purchase that.\n\n60\n00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.340\nAnd it does benefit me monetarily,\n\n61\n00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.740\nbut I noticed that the best\nsalesmen were either nefarious,\n\n62\n00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.990\nthey were guys that went for the jugular,\nor they really believed in the product.\n\n63\n00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.390\n>> They really believed in the product.\n\n64\n00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.260\nThey loved the product.\n\n65\n00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.910\n>> Yeah. Exactly.\n>> They were comfortable with themselves.\n\n66\n00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.180\nAnd they really took time\nto understand the person.\n\n67\n00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.320\nThey really, hey I\n\n68\n00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.740\nreally have a great product and I really\n\n69\n00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.030\nneed to asses,\nfind out this person's needs for\n\n70\n00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.720\nthat product, and I think that good\nsalesmen are always selling to people\n\n71\n00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.870\nrather than selling the product.\n\n72\n00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.929\nThey need to like people,\nwhich becomes one of our principles.\n\n73\n00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.650\nSalesmen really need\nalso to sell themselves.\n\n74\n00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.170\nSo if you don't really have\nan understanding of your own\n\n75\n00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.200\npersonality, your own abilities,\n\n76\n00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.104\nyou're gonna have a hard time bringing\nthat across to somebody else, it's true.\n\n77\n00:04:32.104 --> 00:04:35.930\n>> I've seen hard failures\nin that very arena.\n\n78\n00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.140\nBecause, A,\nit's an uncomfortable thing to try to, and\n\n79\n00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.780\nthat's probably an aspect we\nhaven't even touched on yet.\n\n80\n00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.580\nYou have to have the confidence\nto actually go in and\n\n81\n00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.220\nperform some sort of social\nengineering technique.\n\n82\n00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.020\nIf you don't believe\nthat what you're saying,\n\n83\n00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.070\nthe person that's, their probably\nnot gonna believe you either.\n\n84\n00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.680\nRight?\n>> Right, I mean there are some salesman\n\n85\n00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.970\nthat sell via fear.\n\n86\n00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.220\n>> That's true.\n\n87\n00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.750\n>> They just talk you to death and\n\n88\n00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.210\nyou just succumb just because\n>> It's attrition.\n\n89\n00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.500\n>> Let me go, I'll take it.\n\n90\n00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.530\nYeah, exactly.\n\n91\n00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.760\nBut I think that a good salesman\nas well as a good social engineer\n\n92\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.800\nhas to learn to ask questions.\n\n93\n00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.610\nAnd it really comes down to really\nyour kind of conversation style.\n\n94\n00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:37.220\nA good salesman is not what we call\na narcissistic conversationalist.\n\n95\n00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:44.100\n>> They know how to lead a person, how to\nfind out that person's likes and dislikes.\n\n96\n00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.445\nSo, a good salesman probably talks 60,\n\n97\n00:05:49.445 --> 00:05:54.479\nmaybe has the buyer talk 60,\n70% of the time,\n\n98\n00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.090\nand maybe talks 20% of the time.\n\n99\n00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:04.350\nBut usually it's a matter of well,\nI like that shirt,\n\n100\n00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.920\nbut I think we could probably do maybe\na little bit better with the logo.\n\n101\n00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.990\nI don't know.\n\n102\n00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.570\nDo you like the logo?\n\n103\n00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.010\n>> I do like the logo that we have,\nactually.\n\n104\n00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.565\nBut I see where you're going with this,\n\n105\n00:06:16.565 --> 00:06:18.916\nmy daughter would actually be\na fantastic social engineer.\n\n106\n00:06:18.916 --> 00:06:20.430\nShe'll be a fantastic social engineer.\n\n107\n00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.740\nShe said, Daddy I like your blue shirt.\n\n108\n00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.050\nAnd I'm just like, what do you need honey?\n\n109\n00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.710\nI'll just give you whatever you want.\n\n110\n00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.290\n>> Now is blue your favorite color?\n\n111\n00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.480\n>> Blue is definitely one\nof my preferred colors.\n\n112\n00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.130\nYeah.\n\n113\n00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.430\n>> So, colors seem to influence people.\n\n114\n00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.100\nThey do.\n>> Yeah, it's another aspect.\n\n115\n00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:43.720\nFor a long running time, the color pink\nwas considered to make people more docile.\n\n116\n00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:49.950\nThe penal system decided to paint some\ncells pink just to calm people down.\n\n117\n00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:55.250\nSo, color can have,\nred certainly is kind of exciting,\n\n118\n00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.070\nIntensifying, where blues and\nviolets tend to relax people.\n\n119\n00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.400\nSo something that we work into some\nof the factors is something that\n\n120\n00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.390\na salesman may do\n>> Right and as a social engineer,\n\n121\n00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:13.430\nsomeone who's testing a system, maybe\ncoming in to, maybe as an outsider, as\n\n122\n00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:20.240\na pentester that's been coming in to kind\nof poke at the firewall, per se Right?\n\n123\n00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.970\nCome in maybe wearing a uniform.\n\n124\n00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.340\nThat would elicit\na response of confidence.\n\n125\n00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.570\n>> That's a great term.\n\n126\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.590\nThe human firewall.\n\n127\n00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:28.354\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n128\n00:07:28.354 --> 00:07:30.520\n[LAUGH]\n>> What's the resistance, really?\n\n129\n00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.730\nWhat's the access control list for\nthe unit?\n\n130\n00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:40.020\nSo we find that by going who,\nwhat, where, when, how, why.\n\n131\n00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.540\nThey're basic questions, but\nreally your line of questioning.\n\n132\n00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:50.230\nYour line of asking really should include\nthose different major components.\n\n133\n00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.489\nThose six important questions.\n\n134\n00:07:52.489 --> 00:07:56.611\n>> Who are some other people\ngroups I guess we could call them,\n\n135\n00:07:56.611 --> 00:08:02.230\ndifferent types of groups we would say\nare a natural type of social engineering?\n\n136\n00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.441\nAt least the mindset that\nreally lends itself to this.\n\n137\n00:08:04.441 --> 00:08:06.266\n>> One of my favorites are spies.\n\n138\n00:08:06.266 --> 00:08:07.070\nYeah spies.\n\n139\n00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.584\nI love spies.\n\n140\n00:08:07.584 --> 00:08:08.429\nWho doesn't love spies?\n\n141\n00:08:08.429 --> 00:08:13.100\n>> Yeah, we all love the whole\nJames Bond mentality.\n\n142\n00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.560\nBut to be a good spy, let's face it.\n\n143\n00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:26.000\nMost of our national secrets are leaked\nout because of the techniques of spies.\n\n144\n00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.280\nSpies need to understand how to access,\n\n145\n00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.070\nthey need to understand how to listen,\nhow to lip-read.\n\n146\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.199\nThey need to be able to be\ngood at shoulder surfing.\n\n147\n00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:47.210\nSo spies, a spy is a great way to,\nyou know, there were spy schools.\n\n148\n00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.400\n>> There are, that's right.\n\n149\n00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.100\n>> And I think that anybody that\nwants to further their skills and\n\n150\n00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:58.590\nabilities doing this,\nI encourage you to actually look into it.\n\n151\n00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.680\nTry to understand more about spying.\n\n152\n00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.230\n>> Yeah.\nThere are great books on spies.\n\n153\n00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.240\nI'm a huge military buff.\n\n154\n00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.520\nI love elite counter-terrorism units.\n\n155\n00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.840\nAnd one of them comes to\nmy mind is Delta Force.\n\n156\n00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.630\nRight?\nThe army's elite counter-terrorism unit.\n\n157\n00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.760\nI read a book on Delta Force, and\nthey talked about how they work\n\n158\n00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.620\nwith the CIA to what they call\nfield craft, or trade craft.\n\n159\n00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:25.520\nIdeal techniques on how to follow\npeople,how to evade being followed and\n\n160\n00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.588\nhow to get information, to play a part so\nyou can get information out of a contact,\n\n161\n00:09:30.588 --> 00:09:33.043\nhow to work with contacts,\nvery interesting staff.\n\n162\n00:09:33.043 --> 00:09:35.751\nAnd basically taking what we do,\n\n163\n00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:39.290\nwhen I was a kid when you wanted, for\nme you know it was the girls I liked.\n\n164\n00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.960\nI wanted to get into their lockers and\nread them their notes that they had so\n\n165\n00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.770\nyou learn more about them and then.\n\n166\n00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.910\nYou kind of have a leg up on the girls.\n\n167\n00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:51.260\nSo all my friends, we'd do this,\nwe'd shoulder surf locker combinations.\n\n168\n00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.740\n>> Awesome!\n>> Yeah, it's great.\n\n169\n00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.790\nSo these spies just kept doing that,\nnow they make a living at it.\n\n170\n00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.500\n>> On the other hand,\nwhat you should be weary of that.\n\n171\n00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.620\n>> Exactly.\n\n172\n00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.000\n>> When you go to the ATM machine,\n\n173\n00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.860\nyou punch in your code,\nanybody looking around me?\n\n174\n00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:13.700\n>> And it's so funny how these\npeople that are trying to steal\n\n175\n00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.580\ncredit card information and\nwhat's your PIN number and\n\n176\n00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.950\nthings of that nature,\nthey are some crafty individuals.\n\n177\n00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:21.470\n>> Crafty.\n\n178\n00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.160\n>> The techniques that they use,\n\n179\n00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.390\nthe technology that they'll set in place,\n>> Which doesn't really require\n\n180\n00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:27.981\na lot of technical know how.\n\n181\n00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:31.163\nYou can just purchase these things and\nuse them, or\n\n182\n00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:34.868\nget somebody that does know how\nto do it to build one for you.\n\n183\n00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:37.071\nOr maybe some DIY off of YouTube, and\n\n184\n00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:41.921\nyou create a pin pad that goes over a real\npin pad and it's capturing pin numbers.\n\n185\n00:10:41.921 --> 00:10:44.401\n>> You heard the smudge attack?\n\n186\n00:10:44.401 --> 00:10:46.310\n>> I can't say that I\nknow the smudge attack.\n\n187\n00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:52.200\nSmudge attack simply looking at\na pin pad with proper filters and\n\n188\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.930\nlooking for the fingerprints, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.500\nThey, through research they've been\nable to to detect 60% of the swipes and\n\n190\n00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.480\ncombinations that people\nare using simply by the type of\n\n191\n00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:10.780\nfilter lens that you use just to\nlook at the pad, the smudge attack.\n\n192\n00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.040\n>> Now I haven't heard of that one, but\n\n193\n00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.410\nI have heard of either\nthe phones will do it or you can\n\n194\n00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:21.370\nget an additional camera that clicks into\nyour phone, which is a thermal infrared.\n\n195\n00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:24.910\nAnd if I push down on the keypad,\nI come up right behind you.\n\n196\n00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.110\nAnd I see exactly because\nthe heat signature is there.\n\n197\n00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.880\n>> Right.\n\n198\n00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.690\nTheir crafty people.\n\n199\n00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:31.660\n>> That's all because\nwe watch five movies.\n\n200\n00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:32.310\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n201\n00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:36.950\n>> But actually,\nthat's one of the suggestions really, for\n\n202\n00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:41.288\nanyone wants to understand more about\nsocial engineering, or spying is,\n\n203\n00:11:41.288 --> 00:11:47.850\nread spy books,\ncertainly James Bond is our favorite and\n\n204\n00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.880\nmost prolific spy out there.\n\n205\n00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.520\n>> I was a huge fan of\nthe show Burn Notice.\n\n206\n00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.430\nIt was about a burned spy and\nhis group of friends, and\n\n207\n00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.790\nthey kind of like continue their-\n>> Right, so\n\n208\n00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.990\nour next group is identity thieves.\n\n209\n00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:10.460\nWhich, again,\nare forms of spies, certainly.\n\n210\n00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.660\nIdentity thief is a criminal.\n\n211\n00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.990\nSomebody is definitely doing social\nengineering or social manipulation for\n\n212\n00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.530\nthe various reasons.\n\n213\n00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:24.930\nAnd we know that they could\nsteal our bank information,\n\n214\n00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.450\nthey're going to try to get credit\ncard numbers, they're going after\n\n215\n00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.500\nreally just even names and\naddresses, anything that\n\n216\n00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:41.890\ncan help them to build a profile\non you as an individual,\n\n217\n00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:47.330\nor on your clients and customers,\nokay, on heads of companies.\n\n218\n00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:54.330\nSo, and identity theft is on the rise.\n\n219\n00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:55.290\n>> It's big business.\n\n220\n00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:56.220\n>> It's big business.\n\n221\n00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:00.630\nThe reason it's big business is\nbecause of our change of life from\n\n222\n00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.190\ndoing everything on paper,\nto moving everything on digital.\n\n223\n00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.460\nIt's compounded the problem for us because\n\n224\n00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.770\nnow everyone has a mobile device\nthat's as powerful as a computer.\n\n225\n00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.940\nI'm not telling anybody anything new here.\n\n226\n00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.910\nBut I'm from Philadelphia.\n\n227\n00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:23.900\nI ride the subway.\n\n228\n00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:28.460\nI'm on the subway, everybody's got\na mobile device out looking at it.\n\n229\n00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.190\nOkay, there's two things\nto be said about that.\n\n230\n00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.000\nOne, people aren't very aware\nof what's going on around them.\n\n231\n00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.400\nVery easy to sneak up behind them and\nhit them on the head.\n\n232\n00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.830\n>> Situational awareness.\n\n233\n00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:37.830\n>> Situational awareness.\n\n234\n00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.470\nNo one's paying attention to anything.\n\n235\n00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:46.300\nBut two, when all those devices start\ngetting bugged, should be interesting.\n\n236\n00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.870\nSo that's a whole other\narea of hacking mobile,\n\n237\n00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:56.510\nthat because it's so pervasive,\nit's a big one out there.\n\n238\n00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.350\nSo maybe we can do a video\non that at some point.\n\n239\n00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.072\n>> Yeah that would be fun.\n\n240\n00:13:59.072 --> 00:14:02.230\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now you're talking about bugging right?\n\n241\n00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.720\nI kind of when you say bugging\n\n242\n00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.370\nI automatically think guys like Snowden\nright that they worked for NSA and\n\n243\n00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.960\nNSA has been collecting information and\nlisting in private conversations.\n\n244\n00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.460\n>> Sure.\n\n245\n00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.780\n>> How does that fit into\nsocial engineering as a whole,\n\n246\n00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:25.310\nwhen we label, like the NSA,\nare they social engineers in that sense?\n\n247\n00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:30.510\n>> The NSA certainly are social engineers\nin that sense, having worked with\n\n248\n00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:34.896\ntraining ethical hacking\nwith some analysts from NSA.\n\n249\n00:14:34.896 --> 00:14:39.650\n>> I mean, they're somewhat\n\n250\n00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:43.520\nhemmed in at this point as to what\nthey do, but without a doubt.\n\n251\n00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.050\nSo they can move through what\nthey call a factor of three,\n\n252\n00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:51.340\nwhereas I can watch what you're doing.\n\n253\n00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:55.840\nBut anybody, any of your associates, I can\nnow tap into what they're looking at what\n\n254\n00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:00.240\nkind of messaging, what kind of phone\nconversations, but I can go a third level.\n\n255\n00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:06.440\nThat's a pretty extensive framework,\nthat we can kinda go into.\n\n256\n00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:11.980\nBut it takes Snowden, entirely different,\nhe trained in all those things, but\n\n257\n00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:17.850\nhow he really got to the level\nof information that he got to\n\n258\n00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:22.854\nwas really by,\nwhat's the wi-fi password for here?\n\n259\n00:15:22.854 --> 00:15:23.378\n>> Yeah.\n\n260\n00:15:23.378 --> 00:15:24.723\n[LAUGH]\n>> Or\n\n261\n00:15:24.723 --> 00:15:27.592\nhe got everybody using the passwords.\n\n262\n00:15:27.592 --> 00:15:31.775\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> He just asked for them.\n\n263\n00:15:31.775 --> 00:15:34.303\nDo me a solid,\nwill you give me their stuff?\n\n264\n00:15:34.303 --> 00:15:34.897\nAnd yeah,\n\n265\n00:15:34.897 --> 00:15:39.950\nof course yeah among the group of those\npeople there everybody is pretty trusting.\n\n266\n00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:40.927\n>> It is so funny.\n\n267\n00:15:40.927 --> 00:15:45.133\nOkay, so I've worked in IT as\na business for quite sometime now.\n\n268\n00:15:45.133 --> 00:15:49.100\nProbably if I went from\nthe very proto beginnings.\n\n269\n00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.550\nTo right now, I would say almost 15\nyears I've been in IT in some way,\n\n270\n00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.100\nshape, or form.\n\n271\n00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.540\nAnd as I've worked in IT I've seen\nthe level of trust not with, and\n\n272\n00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.199\nnot even so much with the fact that,\nwe work together.\n\n273\n00:16:02.199 --> 00:16:06.509\nSay if Tom and I were working together for\nthe last ten years, I'm gonna have a level\n\n274\n00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:10.094\nof trust with Tom because he's\nmy colleague, he's my co-worker.\n\n275\n00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:13.387\nI know him, and\nI should have a level of trust, but\n\n276\n00:16:13.387 --> 00:16:16.690\nin this business it pays to be paranoid.\n\n277\n00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:19.520\nI used to have to get on to\nmy clients all the time and\n\n278\n00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.890\nsay, you can't share your password.\n\n279\n00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.630\nI don't care how well you know\nBetty as your secretary, or\n\n280\n00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:29.280\nJimmy as your mail guy, but\ndo not share your username and password.\n\n281\n00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.690\nAnd they say, well why not, I trust them.\n\n282\n00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:36.800\nI say, yeah, that's fine, that's great\nyou trust them but what happens when\n\n283\n00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.300\nBob develops a drug habit,\nand now needs to feed it?\n\n284\n00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.340\nRight?\nAnd he's using your information\n\n285\n00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.010\nto sell information.\n\n286\n00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:48.510\nRight?\nHe's using your credentials to log in,\n\n287\n00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.770\nget information, and\nsell that so he can buy drugs.\n\n288\n00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:55.020\nWhat happens when the secretary\ngets mad at you one day and leaves.\n\n289\n00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.820\nAnd now she still has your username and\npassword.\n\n290\n00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.760\nShe logs in as you,\ndeletes all the records.\n\n291\n00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:04.340\nAnd how am I supposed to say it was her\nthat did it, when it was your log in?\n\n292\n00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.070\nRight?\n\n293\n00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:09.640\nThis is why we do not trust at that\nlevel with usernames and passwords.\n\n294\n00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:15.060\nAnd it's so funny that a guy like Stone's\njust able to go hey, do me a solid.\n\n295\n00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.710\nThat's what we need to be teaching\nour people to guard against.\n\n296\n00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:19.640\n>> Right.\n\n297\n00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.790\nSo a couple others, magicians.\n\n298\n00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:30.980\nI love magicians, my nephew's a magician,\nand so he does some, they always,\n\n299\n00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:36.160\nthe main thing about the magician is the\nmagician basically has the redirection.\n\n300\n00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:36.900\n>> Right.\n\n301\n00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.660\n>> You know what I mean?\n\n302\n00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.145\nSo they slide the thing and say.\n\n303\n00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:43.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Look at that pen.\n\n304\n00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.620\nIt's like but.\n\n305\n00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:50.970\nYou know, they've got the patter with it,\nthey know how to bring an audience along\n\n306\n00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:57.234\nand say hey what's your favorite color,\n\n307\n00:17:57.234 --> 00:18:02.010\nwhat do you like about today?\n\n308\n00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:06.689\nSo I take this ordinary pen which\nmight be such and such a color and\n\n309\n00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:15.200\nyou know, it has a point to it and just\nreally describe all the elements of it,\n\n310\n00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.700\ndistract you to a certain point that\nyou say yeah, that's pretty cool.\n\n311\n00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.610\nAnd the next thing you\nknow you've disappeared.\n\n312\n00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:24.110\n>> Right.\n\n313\n00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:28.910\n>> It's funny, they are great masters\nof not only just redirection but\n\n314\n00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.170\nas well I actually know a magician.\n\n315\n00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:37.620\nMy friend Eric actually runs Wizards down\nin Orlando, which is like a magic theater,\n\n316\n00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.490\nand they do a lot of\nthe art of cold reading.\n\n317\n00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.390\nThey read about cold reading,\npicking up things about the person so\n\n318\n00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.798\nthey can use it in the act.\n\n319\n00:18:46.798 --> 00:18:53.730\nAnd to make, build up more of a sense\nof believability, that they are magic.\n\n320\n00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.130\n>> Sure.\n>> It's that.\n\n321\n00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:56.950\n>> Sure.\n>> How do you know that about me?\n\n322\n00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:00.140\n>> Sure.\n>> And it's all through just elicitation.\n\n323\n00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.290\nOf, what's your favorite color,\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n324\n00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:03.030\n>> Right.\n>> They take a look at\n\n325\n00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:06.010\nwhat you're wearing,\nhow you hold yourself, your dialect,\n\n326\n00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:10.050\nmaybe an accent, and they can come pick up\nwhere you're from and how you've lived.\n\n327\n00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.427\n>> Anyway, in the back there\ngoing through your Facebook page.\n\n328\n00:19:13.427 --> 00:19:14.730\n>> Exactly, yeah.\n\n329\n00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:15.589\n>> Today.\n>> Exactly, yeah.\n\n330\n00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:17.680\nIt's true.\n\n331\n00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.610\nIt's true, it's true.\n\n332\n00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:21.230\n>> Alright, so\nwhat else do we need to go through?\n\n333\n00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:22.560\n>> Well, I got a couple more.\n\n334\n00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.430\n>> Alright.\n>> So burglars and thieves.\n\n335\n00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:26.280\n>> Yeah.\n\n336\n00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.340\n>> Great.\nWhere I grew up in Philadelphia,\n\n337\n00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.420\nthere was a famous gang\ncalled the K&A Gang.\n\n338\n00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:38.403\nThese guys were notorious for\nripping off really expensive place.\n\n339\n00:19:38.403 --> 00:19:41.210\n[INAUDIBLE] they were\nalways traveling down,\n\n340\n00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:46.020\nbut their signature was that they\nalways wore a suit to a ripoff.\n\n341\n00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:50.506\nOkay but they would case out they\nwould know when they weren't there.\n\n342\n00:19:50.506 --> 00:19:56.890\nThey were actually burglars in this sense,\n\n343\n00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:02.240\nand I got to spend a little time,\nactually live with one of the guys.\n\n344\n00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:07.090\nIt was AKNA gang thief and he taught me\n\n345\n00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:11.890\na really cool trick that I use to this\nday, and that's the use of the card.\n\n346\n00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:12.780\n>> Hm.\n>> I can, you know,\n\n347\n00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.879\nI won't go through a dead bolt, but I'll\ngo through any door with a latch lock.\n\n348\n00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.890\nSimply with a plastic card.\n\n349\n00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:20.760\n>> That's pretty impressive.\n\n350\n00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.480\nI've seen it on TV, but.\n\n351\n00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.720\n>> It's so simple.\n\n352\n00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.632\n>> I've never seen it in real life.\n\n353\n00:20:23.632 --> 00:20:26.335\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's a very simple, simple concept.\n\n354\n00:20:26.335 --> 00:20:30.820\nSo, burglars and thieves need to still\nutilize all the same principles.\n\n355\n00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:31.880\nLove it.\n\n356\n00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:37.230\nAnd, as well, con men con men\n\n357\n00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:42.940\nare probably the most natural [INAUDIBLE],\nyou know, and I think here's a case where\n\n358\n00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:49.100\na social engineer probably is\nsomebody that's learning this skill.\n\n359\n00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.140\nWe see jobs today, I mean probably\nthe first pen testers, the first social\n\n360\n00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.570\nengineers were guys that were hackers that\nJust had a natural inclination for it.\n\n361\n00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:03.200\nNow we're moving into a second\nwave where people are actually\n\n362\n00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.790\nlearning the skills and abilities of it.\n\n363\n00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:10.510\nThere's probably no replacement,\nreally, just for having that natural,\n\n364\n00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:15.460\ndevious personality that you\nreally understand people,\n\n365\n00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.760\nand you're able to talk to them,\nmanipulate them or\n\n366\n00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.530\nyou've gotta like people if you\nare going to be a social engineer.\n\n367\n00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:28.220\nYou've got to be able to relate and\nto harmonize with them and\n\n368\n00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.480\nfind the likes and differences.\n\n369\n00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:36.880\nAnd, of course, you and me as we saw that\n\n370\n00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.920\none video, I think the best one\nwas the kid go for the happy meal.\n\n371\n00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.190\n>> Yeah.\n>> I mean I really kinda like what the way\n\n372\n00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:51.570\nthat would came out because how many times\nhave you done that to a parent, you know.\n\n373\n00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:57.160\nSay hey,\nI really need the special Christmas thing,\n\n374\n00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.740\nif that another example\nis the toy manufacturers.\n\n375\n00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:07.520\nSo, the toy manufacturers will put a lot\nof advertising out prior to Christmas.\n\n376\n00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.490\nKids will watch the kids' shows,\nand they'll love it.\n\n377\n00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:13.050\nWell, you go to the toy store\nto actually buy the toy.\n\n378\n00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:14.110\nIt's not available.\n\n379\n00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.980\nThey're out.\n\n380\n00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:22.180\nYou'll only get a chance to buy that toy\naround February when sales are slumping.\n\n381\n00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:28.520\nIt's timed that way- Just because\nyou promised your daughter that\n\n382\n00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.700\nyou were gonna give her that doll,\nor whatever the toy of the year is.\n\n383\n00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.460\n>> It's all-\n>> The Cabbage Patch Kid, or the-\n\n384\n00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.144\n>> Nothing happens by

00:22:45.440\nthe data that comes from that, so.\n\n388\n00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.600\n>> So, this is data driven?\n\n389\n00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.890\n>> This is data driven, yeah, right?\n\n390\n00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:49.650\n>> Very funny.\n\n391\n00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:50.440\n>> Very funny, yeah.\n\n392\n00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.740\n>> All right, so let's see here.\n\n393\n00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:57.740\nI guess now we know the kinda people,\nand even some of them, I guess I'm\n\n394\n00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.300\ngonna answer a little bit of them, or we\nhave answered this question to an extent.\n\n395\n00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.370\nWhat are some of the reasons that people\n\n396\n00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:07.670\nuse social engineering in\neither day to day life or.\n\n397\n00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:10.480\n>> For the purposes, or obviously,\nthat's one of the purposes.\n\n398\n00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.500\nI'm trying to break into your system, but,\ntypically we see this happening more,\n\n399\n00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:20.360\nthan just in, as a pen tester,\nor as a blackhat or\n\n400\n00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.850\ncrack, or whatever you wanna call them,\ntrying to break into a system.\n\n401\n00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:25.490\nWe see social engineering,\n\n402\n00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:28.510\nsocial influence happening for\nother types of reasons.\n\n403\n00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:32.720\nWe kinda hit on this, but I wanna make\nsure we have a good solid Point by point.\n\n404\n00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:40.548\n>> One of my managers,\nRafay super fantastic ethical hacker.\n\n405\n00:23:40.548 --> 00:23:44.890\nRaf goes, well you black out the wires but\n\n406\n00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:48.730\nI don't know anybody that actually\nis one or the other, you know?\n\n407\n00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:52.318\nEverybody's just shades of grade,\nyou know?\n\n408\n00:23:52.318 --> 00:23:58.157\nAnd it's kinda true in that way,\nbut there's probably an ethical\n\n409\n00:23:58.157 --> 00:24:03.383\nthinking here except that my\nethics may not be your ethics.\n\n410\n00:24:03.383 --> 00:24:08.060\nAnd I'd ethically like to hold on to my\nmoney, you'd ethically like to get it.\n\n411\n00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.270\n>> Exactly.\n\n412\n00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:12.470\n>> So one of my martial arts teachers,\nEd Parker,\n\n413\n00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.520\ntold me this story about\nethics years back.\n\n414\n00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:19.070\nAnd he says there's a shop keeper at\nthe end of the day doing a money count.\n\n415\n00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:25.100\nSo he's pulled in, he realizes\nhe's got an extra $20 in the till.\n\n416\n00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.890\nTwo twenties have stuck together,\nyou know?\n\n417\n00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:34.620\nAnd a young kid there with him,\nhe says, what's your problem?\n\n418\n00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.045\nHe says, well, I got a moral,\nethical dilemma here.\n\n419\n00:24:38.045 --> 00:24:39.990\nHe says, well, what's that?\n\n420\n00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:41.999\nWell, I got an extra $20.\n\n421\n00:24:41.999 --> 00:24:45.780\nMrs. Jones came in and\nbought something, two stuck together.\n\n422\n00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:50.950\nWell, so why don't you just call Mrs.\nJones and give her back the money?\n\n423\n00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:52.480\nWell, that's not the problem really.\n\n424\n00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.370\nWell what is it?\n\n425\n00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:59.560\nWell he says, well, my problem is, should\nI keep the 20 or split it with my partner.\n\n426\n00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.530\nPut it, the moral of the story is, is that\n>> He had his own ethics.\n\n427\n00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:05.780\n>> He had his own ethics.\n\n428\n00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:10.490\nYou know, and in a sense,\nwhat is right for\n\n429\n00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.810\nyou is not necessarily right for\nthe next person.\n\n430\n00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:17.830\nBut it does illustrate\nhow people think today.\n\n431\n00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:20.900\n>> Right, they justify a lot of things\nin their own lives, like, it's okay for\n\n432\n00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.266\npeople to take me,\ncuz she accidentally gave it to me.\n\n433\n00:25:24.266 --> 00:25:28.661\nSo her ill fortune is my gain, and\nthat was his ethics, so there you go.\n\n434\n00:25:28.661 --> 00:25:30.155\nWe see that happen [CROSSTALK].\n\n435\n00:25:30.155 --> 00:25:31.639\n>> Certainly, that revolved around money.\n\n436\n00:25:31.639 --> 00:25:36.090\nWe know that money is a big driver,\na big influencer, but not for everybody.\n\n437\n00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:40.760\nSome people like to socially engineer\njust because it's entertaining.\n\n438\n00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.960\nIt's fun, they like to do it,\nthey're driven to it.\n\n439\n00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:50.310\nStatus, in order to get\ninto a particular group\n\n440\n00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:55.160\nI need to really show that I want to.\n\n441\n00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.360\nYou know,\n\n442\n00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:02.060\nkids may be driven to steal simply\nbecause everybody else thinks it's cool.\n\n443\n00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:06.110\nSo it might be perceived as cool\nto do these types of things.\n\n444\n00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:14.280\nWith somebody like Snowden, it's a belief.\n\n445\n00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:19.570\nWell, we think it's a belief,\nthat's what it looks like to us.\n\n446\n00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.060\nWe'll assume that's what it is.\n\n447\n00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:26.020\nBut people are driven because\nof political, sociological,\n\n448\n00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:30.900\nenvironmental reasons to socially\n\n449\n00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:36.330\nengineer to get their needs met.\n\n450\n00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:38.880\n>> And these things, we see today like,\n\n451\n00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.370\nhacktivism, where they\nare groups like Anonymous.\n\n452\n00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:45.070\nI know that they have,\nthey've taken on an ethos and\n\n453\n00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.470\nan ethic that says\n>> this is what we believe is right,\n\n454\n00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.450\nthis is what we believe is wrong, and\n\n455\n00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:54.760\nwe use our influence to those ends to try\nto either right or wrong or whatever.\n\n456\n00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:00.355\n>> Yeah, I haven't really seen like\nAnonymous do anything straight forward as\n\n457\n00:27:00.355 --> 00:27:05.443\na social engineering attack,\ncause it's always denial of service.\n\n458\n00:27:05.443 --> 00:27:08.551\n>> That's true, but they do it for\nthe purposes of [CROSSTALK]\n\n459\n00:27:08.551 --> 00:27:11.376\n>> Their purposes are definitely\n\n460\n00:27:11.376 --> 00:27:12.683\naltruistic.\n\n461\n00:27:12.683 --> 00:27:18.691\nBut even though we have seen that\neven within the ranks of Anonymous,\n\n462\n00:27:18.691 --> 00:27:25.544\nthat there have been money making,\nyou know, people have made money anyway.\n\n463\n00:27:25.544 --> 00:27:29.459\nSo even hacktivism can [CROSSTALK]\n>> Have its dark side, right?\n\n464\n00:27:29.459 --> 00:27:30.376\nYeah, right.\n\n465\n00:27:30.376 --> 00:27:36.100\nAnd of course, acceptance,\nwe wanna be accepted into a group,\n\n466\n00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:40.970\nmuch like any other kind\nof group initiation.\n\n467\n00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:48.011\nFraternities, sororities,\nGod knows what people do to get in.\n\n468\n00:27:48.011 --> 00:27:49.977\nSo, there's a lot of driving forces, yeah.\n\n469\n00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.342\nWe also have areas of attacks.\n\n470\n00:27:55.342 --> 00:28:00.572\nFor instance, who are the biggest victims?\n\n471\n00:28:00.572 --> 00:28:01.493\n>> Right, who's the targets?\n\n472\n00:28:01.493 --> 00:28:02.148\n>> We know the front lines.\n\n473\n00:28:02.148 --> 00:28:02.764\n>> Yeah.\n\n474\n00:28:02.764 --> 00:28:06.936\n>> We have the front line of users,\n\n475\n00:28:06.936 --> 00:28:11.275\nour receptionist, our guards.\n\n476\n00:28:11.275 --> 00:28:15.885\nBut really,\nmaybe even the janitor that works for\n\n477\n00:28:15.885 --> 00:28:20.056\nthe company may know\nmore about the goings and\n\n478\n00:28:20.056 --> 00:28:25.984\ncomings of the C.E.O than you\ncould find trail on the C.E.O.\n\n479\n00:28:25.984 --> 00:28:31.504\nYou maybe able to really draw\nsome information from there.\n\n480\n00:28:31.504 --> 00:28:37.183\nSo but C.E.O,\n[CROSSTALK] executives seem to be for\n\n481\n00:28:37.183 --> 00:28:40.802\nthe big money, the big targets.\n\n482\n00:28:40.802 --> 00:28:44.940\nAnd usually because they don't\nalways play by the rules,\n\n483\n00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:48.917\nthey're probably the ones\nthat wanna quick password.\n\n484\n00:28:48.917 --> 00:28:53.010\nUsually they're the ones that say, I\ndon't wanna have, I don't want passwords.\n\n485\n00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.410\nYou say, well, you really need them,\nit's really important.\n\n486\n00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:57.330\nYeah, nobody really cares about my stuff.\n\n487\n00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.240\nOkay, and you tell me that when they wire,\n\n488\n00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.480\nyou know,\na million dollars out of your account.\n\n489\n00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:09.090\n>> And they have the influence to say, I\ncut your check, you do what I say, right?\n\n490\n00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:13.360\nAnd of course we try to tell them I say\nyou cut our checks so we can protect you.\n\n491\n00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.335\nAnd if you are basically going to gut that\nout than you just need to let me go and\n\n492\n00:29:17.335 --> 00:29:19.430\nfind somebody that is just a yes-man.\n\n493\n00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:23.880\nThat is our job as pen testers,\nas security people for companies, is to\n\n494\n00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:29.080\nprotect them literally from themselves\na lot of the times because you are right.\n\n495\n00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.810\nI have seen it, where the CEO says,\nI am a special case.\n\n496\n00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:36.230\nEverybody else has to follow these rules,\nnot me.\n\n497\n00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:41.320\n>> Exactly, I think\n\n498\n00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.351\nprobably right now probably the best\nto just add in the negative\n\n499\n00:29:46.351 --> 00:29:50.740\ninfluence or\nthe negative impact of social engineering.\n\n500\n00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:56.950\nBecause as we kind of play with these\nconcepts and principles it's a lot\n\n501\n00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:02.310\nof deceit that goes on in social\nengineering in order to be good at this.\n\n502\n00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:06.340\nI warn you against polluting\nyour own state of mind\n\n503\n00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:17.900\nbecause it can have a negative impact,\nor your own personality development.\n\n504\n00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.680\nYeah.\nSo most of us see a common good.\n\n505\n00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.950\nWe see that line, we try to stay on one\nside of it, but it can be tempting.\n\n506\n00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:32.019\nAnd I don't say you couldn't use social\nengineering to get a better job,\n\n507\n00:30:32.019 --> 00:30:33.589\nto get a raise, okay?\n\n508\n00:30:33.589 --> 00:30:36.917\nIt [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, those things are positives.\n\n509\n00:30:36.917 --> 00:30:41.904\n>> Yeah, those are positive\nthings that it's the little chick\n\n510\n00:30:41.904 --> 00:30:46.375\nthat doesn't chirp that\ndoesn't get the love.\n\n511\n00:30:46.375 --> 00:30:51.120\nOkay, so in a sense it's important,\nI think, for\n\n512\n00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.360\nus to get the things that we\nneed that we do need to apply.\n\n513\n00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.780\n>> Now Tom, we've got

00:31:04.440\nmaybe some real world examples of where\nsocial engineering has gone wrong?\n\n517\n00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.540\n>> So there's actually\na situation that's current now.\n\n518\n00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:12.820\nIt's actually been going on since\n2013 when it was kinda discovered.\n\n519\n00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:17.918\nSo the villain is named Fat Leonard.\n\n520\n00:31:17.918 --> 00:31:19.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n521\n00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.970\nhere's a guy who seduced\nthe Seventh Fleet.\n\n522\n00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.950\nIn fact, I got a Capture,\nyou can throw it up and\n\n523\n00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:28.390\nget a beautiful picture of Leonard here.\n\n524\n00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:31.350\nAnd we can see why Leonard\nmight be called fat.\n\n525\n00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:33.490\n>> Very charming.\n\n526\n00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:37.930\n>> Actually, Leonard's tool was charm.\n\n527\n00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:41.860\nLeonard basically through booze,\n\n528\n00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:47.493\nelectronic devices,\nprostitutes, vacations,\n\n529\n00:31:47.493 --> 00:31:53.264\nhe worked his way through\nthe entire Seventh Fleet.\n\n530\n00:31:53.264 --> 00:31:59.002\nBasically, he set up these fueling and\nsalvage services\n\n531\n00:31:59.002 --> 00:32:05.814\nwhere they would basically Take all\nthe discharge from the ships and\n\n532\n00:32:05.814 --> 00:32:11.100\nserviced them through\nthe entire Asian area.\n\n533\n00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:15.820\nThe thing about it being a normal service,\nbut\n\n534\n00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:19.600\nhow he got his contract was really just\nthrough influencing and talking to people.\n\n535\n00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.570\nAnd then, why I do you a good?\n\n536\n00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:28.700\nDo you a solid, you do me a solid, so we\nuse that old principle of reciprocation.\n\n537\n00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.940\n>> It's good old fashioned palm greasing.\n\n538\n00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:31.890\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n539\n00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.915\nThere's a number of people who went\nto jail already in this case, and\n\n540\n00:32:36.915 --> 00:32:40.300\nthere is a few that are still outstanding.\n\n541\n00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:41.580\nStill, it's gonna work on them.\n\n542\n00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:46.430\nBut this thing went probably for\nthe tune of $20 million\n\n543\n00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:49.630\nthat they think he's\nfleeced the Navy out of.\n\n544\n00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:51.410\n>> And where does that money come from?\n\n545\n00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:53.350\n>> Yeah, where does that money come from?\n\n546\n00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:54.450\nYeah, you bet.\n\n547\n00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:55.050\nYou bet.\n\n548\n00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:57.850\nYeah, we could build a better ship,\nyou know?\n\n549\n00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.639\nSo the next case in mind,\n\n550\n00:33:02.639 --> 00:33:07.507\nwe can drop Fat Leonard, is the RSA hack.\n\n551\n00:33:07.507 --> 00:33:13.390\nSo the RSA hack was through\n\n552\n00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:19.011\na zero day Java exploit.\n\n553\n00:33:19.011 --> 00:33:21.300\nSimply a spearfishing attack, okay?\n\n554\n00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:24.016\nIf you don't know what spearfishing is,\n\n555\n00:33:24.016 --> 00:33:29.074\nit's when you pick a particular person\nout, find their likes and dislikes.\n\n556\n00:33:29.074 --> 00:33:33.434\nSay you're into golf.\n\n557\n00:33:33.434 --> 00:33:40.946\nSo I put together a little golf brochure,\ntalk about this particular golf site,\n\n558\n00:33:40.946 --> 00:33:44.927\ninvite you to a weekend there or whatever.\n\n559\n00:33:44.927 --> 00:33:48.400\nAnd there was that, you opened it once,\nyou opened it twice.\n\n560\n00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:53.031\nThe third time, I'm gonna slip in\nthis backdoor Java exploit and\n\n561\n00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:57.190\nyou'd never knew anything\nhappened to your computer.\n\n562\n00:33:57.190 --> 00:34:02.450\nBut, you know, you've just backdoored and\nbrought somebody into it.\n\n563\n00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:06.340\nFrom that case, RSA,\n\n564\n00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:10.780\nthey estimate it was probably\nthe tune of 20 million.\n\n565\n00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.110\n>> Seems to be the magic number.\n\n566\n00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:16.005\n>> Yeah, 20 million's a magic number.\n\n567\n00:34:16.005 --> 00:34:19.405\nBut from that,\nthere wasn't too much that happened.\n\n568\n00:34:19.405 --> 00:34:23.595\nBut shortly after that,\nLockheed Martin was hacked.\n\n569\n00:34:23.595 --> 00:34:30.325\nThey were hacked through a third\nparty provider who had a VPN access.\n\n570\n00:34:30.325 --> 00:34:36.859\nBut in the same way,\nit was a hack of the RSATs.\n\n571\n00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:46.250\nTwo walls, which I think are notable,\nwas the ABN bank\n\n572\n00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.781\nwhich there were no computers used.\n\n573\n00:34:49.781 --> 00:34:57.068\nSimply, the vector was\na teller who worked there.\n\n574\n00:34:57.068 --> 00:35:00.500\nHad some access.\n\n575\n00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:05.200\nA box of chocolates, where he was able to\n\n576\n00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:10.290\ngather information as to where\nthese jewels were being kept.\n\n577\n00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:15.440\nHe kind of knew about it but didn't\nknow in what safe deposit box they were.\n\n578\n00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:22.390\nHe managed to get the master key to\nall the boxes, certainly made a copy.\n\n579\n00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:27.790\nActually got it into his possession for\none time and walked in the bank,\n\n580\n00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:34.560\ncleaned the bank out of 27\nmillion pounds in jewelry,\n\n581\n00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:39.260\nin diamonds and gems, and walked out.\n\n582\n00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:43.150\nNobody knows who he is, where he went,\nor what'd he do with them.\n\n583\n00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:44.160\n>> Never touched a computer.\n\n584\n00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.010\n>> He never touched a computer.\n\n585\n00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:51.124\nThe stories are incredible.\n\n586\n00:35:51.124 --> 00:35:56.339\nJust the types of social engineering\nexploits that have been done,\n\n587\n00:35:56.339 --> 00:36:01.094\nand I think it's helpful for\neverybody to kind of research and\n\n588\n00:36:01.094 --> 00:36:06.399\nlook at some of the conmen, some of\nthe con jobs that have been done and\n\n589\n00:36:06.399 --> 00:36:11.819\nhow people do it and how they exploit\nit and what the human factors are.\n\n590\n00:36:11.819 --> 00:36:13.017\nAnd they're not weaknesses.\n\n591\n00:36:13.017 --> 00:36:16.342\nI mean, we all wanna help somebody,\n\n592\n00:36:16.342 --> 00:36:20.432\nwe really wanna do somebody\na favor if we can.\n\n593\n00:36:20.432 --> 00:36:25.420\nBut at the same time, it should teach\nus more about still being wary,\n\n594\n00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:30.360\nhaving an awareness of the environment,\nand what can happen.\n\n595\n00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.310\nAnd I think that that's\nwhere we're headed with it.\n\n596\n00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:33.415\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n597\n00:36:33.415 --> 00:36:36.885\nObviously a healthy dose of\njust a little bit of cynicism,\n\n598\n00:36:36.885 --> 00:36:42.467\nmaybe a little bit of skepticism, will\nhelp us, not to disband or trust people.\n\n599\n00:36:42.467 --> 00:36:44.135\n>> No, we're going to hit it.\n\n600\n00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:48.527\nCarl Sagan's,\nwhat they call the bs detector.\n\n601\n00:36:48.527 --> 00:36:50.012\n>> Yeah, there we go.\n\n602\n00:36:50.012 --> 00:36:51.237\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n>> The bs detector.\n\n603\n00:36:51.237 --> 00:36:54.407\n>> We have to fine tune this\ndevice within ourselves so\n\n604\n00:36:54.407 --> 00:36:57.725\nthat we can mitigate\nthese types of attacks.\n\n605\n00:36:57.725 --> 00:37:01.667\nMake sure that our systems are at\nleast as safe as we can make them, and\n\n606\n00:37:01.667 --> 00:37:07.557\nthen constantly retesting and retesting\nto continually ensure that safety.\n\n607\n00:37:07.557 --> 00:37:10.780\nTom, thank you so much again for\ndropping by today.\n\n608\n00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:14.540\nVery fascinating topic, I know our\naudience is gonna just eat this alive.\n\n609\n00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:17.469\nWe appreciate your expertise but,\nlooking at the clock,\n\n610\n00:37:17.469 --> 00:37:21.251\nlooks like we've run out of time just\na little bit so we're gonna sign off.\n\n611\n00:37:21.251 --> 00:37:23.744\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n612\n00:37:23.744 --> 00:37:25.144\n>> And

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:20.039\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie in today's\nepisode we are continuing one of\n\n4\n00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.672\nour Social Engineering series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.672 --> 00:00:25.340\nJoining us back in the studio again to\nlend his expertise on that topic is our\n\n6\n00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.110\ngood friend, Mr. Tom Updegrove.\n\n7\n00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.840\nTom, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.010\nWe're so glad to have you here today.\n\n9\n00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.370\n>> I'm happy to be back and\n\n10\n00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:38.030\nready to go on this planning and\nreconnaissance module we're doing.\n\n11\n00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.030\nAll right, planning and reconnaissance are\ndefinitely interesting title for our show.\n\n12\n00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.490\n>> I think there are more interesting\nparts, but you gotta have a battle plan.\n\n13\n00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.150\n>> So that's what we mean when we\nsay planning and reconnaissance.\n\n14\n00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.860\nThis is our battle plan.\n\n15\n00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.860\nWell take us into that.\n\n16\n00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.700\nDive right in, don't let us stop you.\n\n17\n00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.890\nLet's hit the ground running.\n\n18\n00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.990\nWhat's the first thing we need to know?\n\n19\n00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.640\n>> Well the first thing we need to know is\nthat we can't go any type of a penthouse.\n\n20\n00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.530\nWithout written permission.\n\n21\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.110\nAnd we just can't go out pen testing\ncompanies for the sake of it because,\n\n22\n00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.160\nquite frankly, it's against the law.\n\n23\n00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.140\nSo having a written,\nformal document in your hands for\n\n24\n00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.560\na pen test is very, very important.\n\n25\n00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.980\nIn the trade,\nit's know as a get out of jail card.\n\n26\n00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.030\nAnd in most cases it'll protect you.\n\n27\n00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.120\nBut, the important elements\nof that are again, who,\n\n28\n00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.920\nwhat, where, when, how, and why.\n\n29\n00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.170\nIn that formal document which should\nbe signed off by the highest level,\n\n30\n00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.240\nunless the highest level is the one\nthat's really being pen-tested.\n\n31\n00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.810\nYou should detail every element.\n\n32\n00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.180\nLater on, as we move on here, I'm gonna\npull up like a checklist that I use.\n\n33\n00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.005\nA checklist will say we're looking for\nour documents.\n\n34\n00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:02.365\nWhat type of documents?\n\n35\n00:02:02.365 --> 00:02:05.215\nAre we looking for Word?\n\n36\n00:02:05.215 --> 00:02:09.545\nAre we looking for\nany type of email communication?\n\n37\n00:02:09.545 --> 00:02:12.895\nIs this really something, we're just\nreally lucky cuz there was this one time\n\n38\n00:02:12.895 --> 00:02:17.870\nI was asked to do an assessment\nof three guys who were gonna be\n\n39\n00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.865\nVice-Presidents in a company, in a Farm\nCompany, and I just wanna know was there\n\n40\n00:02:21.865 --> 00:02:27.290\nany derogatory information out there\nabout them, all on the websites.\n\n41\n00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.140\nYou have something that would look bad for\nthe company,\n\n42\n00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.170\nas well as maybe they weren't really\nthe kind of people that we wanted.\n\n43\n00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.090\n>> So it was a type of vetting.\n\n44\n00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.540\n>> A type of vetting process,\nthat's right.\n\n45\n00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.250\n>> To make sure that they were who they\nwanted to represent their company.\n\n46\n00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.180\n>> Exactly, right.\nAnd then even there,\n\n47\n00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.290\nyou need to know how far you're gonna go.\n\n48\n00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.290\nI mean,\nnow I gotta start looking at his friends.\n\n49\n00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.920\nDo I look into his kids?\n\n50\n00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.690\nHis children?\n\n51\n00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:50.660\nCousins?\n\n52\n00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.640\nI mean, do we go that second step,\nthat third step, and\n\n53\n00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.800\ntry to undercover information that maybe\nthat person doesn't want him to know.\n\n54\n00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.498\nThat's why some people\nmight hide their taxes.\n\n55\n00:03:02.498 --> 00:03:08.860\nSo anyway, so,\nit's important that we do that.\n\n56\n00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.060\nBut we need to plan accordingly.\n\n57\n00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:19.880\nSo I think the planning process\nhas a number of stages to it.\n\n58\n00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.690\nSo let's say that we do decide.\n\n59\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.490\nWe're hired for a job, okay.\n\n60\n00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.690\nWe define actually what\nthose elements are.\n\n61\n00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.820\nI use a concept that I've actually\nborrowed from Chinese medicine.\n\n62\n00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.550\nThat, pop up my little\nfive element diagram and\n\n63\n00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.330\nI'm just gonna throw these out there.\n\n64\n00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.770\nIt really doesn't matter, I think in\nthis case, what we name these elements.\n\n65\n00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.677\nIt just so happens that there's\nan element of earth, wood, fire,\n\n66\n00:03:52.677 --> 00:03:57.080\nmetal and water.\n\n67\n00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.990\nBut as I utilize this diagram I kinda\nlike to put it into this representation.\n\n68\n00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.220\nSo this earth element is what\nwe called grounding, okay?\n\n69\n00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.660\nBut earth is really\nthe balance of everything else.\n\n70\n00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.710\nIf we have a good plan and\nprogress and it's working, fine.\n\n71\n00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.930\nWood really is like\nthe beginning of the plan.\n\n72\n00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.950\nThe inspiration of it,\nthe creativity of it.\n\n73\n00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.210\nBut fire really is\nthe intellectual part of it.\n\n74\n00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:33.555\nWell, we could, hey, why don't we\ngo after all the email provider.\n\n75\n00:04:33.555 --> 00:04:36.965\nLet's try to really get the admin password\n\n76\n00:04:38.155 --> 00:04:41.495\nlet's find all the users,\neven if they're not even relevant.\n\n77\n00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:45.555\nYou can get a little carried away\nwith that part of it because your\n\n78\n00:04:45.555 --> 00:04:49.700\nplan might become bigger than\nyour metal capabilities.\n\n79\n00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.270\nSo metal is really your constraints.\n\n80\n00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.220\nYou're limited by your resources.\n\n81\n00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.560\nLet's say those jobs have only been paying\nfor two days so you could only go so far.\n\n82\n00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.490\nSo you need to rein\nyourself in at some point.\n\n83\n00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.900\nYou get expansive,\nyou rein yourself in and\n\n84\n00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.350\nthen you define those\ncharacteristics a little better.\n\n85\n00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.230\nBut what happens is,\nwhile you're reining it in,\n\n86\n00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.650\nsometimes you'll find,\nman I'm never gonna get through this.\n\n87\n00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.160\nThere's too much we gotta do.\n\n88\n00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.560\nToo many controls on it.\n\n89\n00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.680\nI'm never gonna get this done.\n\n90\n00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.700\nThe element of water is your\npush through at the end,\n\n91\n00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.430\nmore like yeah, but I could do it.\n\n92\n00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.520\nI can make this thing happen.\n\n93\n00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.580\nI've got the confidence.\n\n94\n00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.870\nI've done if before.\n\n95\n00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.810\nAnd but it's all those elements.\n\n96\n00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.130\nIf I don't have the wood.\n\n97\n00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.080\nThe wood really be like\nour reconnaissance.\n\n98\n00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.630\nWe gotta dig in, we gotta roll that\ninformation about the company.\n\n99\n00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.750\nThen we need to analyze it, right.\n\n100\n00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.200\nThen we need to go, well,\nwhat should we include?\n\n101\n00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.190\nWhat shouldn't we include?\n\n102\n00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.360\nHow far should we go?\n\n103\n00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.290\n>> This is really making me think of\nproject management.type of IPS, yeah.\n\n104\n00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.790\n>> This is project management to the T.\n\n105\n00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.410\nI mean, really, the Chinese physician,\nyour acupuncturist,\n\n106\n00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.490\nif you've ever been to one,\nactually goes through a system like this.\n\n107\n00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.110\nAnd why I threw this chart up is because\nof the traits, the anger, the arrogance,\n\n108\n00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.740\nthe worry, the sadness and the fear,\nthat's in the next-to-last column.\n\n109\n00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.120\nPlus the mental states.\n\n110\n00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.890\nIf you look at this,\nit's pretty interesting,\n\n111\n00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.010\nbecause we're gonna deal with this.\n\n112\n00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.980\nWe're gonna deal with approaches\nthat are going to be totally visual.\n\n113\n00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.280\nSome people, you approach it\nmore from an audible level.\n\n114\n00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.180\nThey gather things up better\njust by listening to it.\n\n115\n00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.970\nSome people are better through touch.\n\n116\n00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.840\nAs some people reel from the touch,\nthey don't want to be touched.\n\n117\n00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.800\nSo it's really a process.\n\n118\n00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.490\nWe can apply this towards the types of\nattacks that we're going to have as well\n\n119\n00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.070\nas the types of personalities that\nwe're going to apply them towards.\n\n120\n00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:05.010\nMy reason for bringing up is that it's\nvery similar to the scientific method.\n\n121\n00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.660\nHere's our sixth grade science.\n\n122\n00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.448\nBut yet, you have a theory,\n\n123\n00:07:10.448 --> 00:07:16.820\nyou hypothesize about what\nthe outcome would be.\n\n124\n00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.090\nIf I do a, will b happen, will c happen?\n\n125\n00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.720\nWe find out, we experiment.\n\n126\n00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.370\nRight?\n\n127\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:28.090\nFrom the data that we get back from\nour experiment, we can then say,\n\n128\n00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.240\nprove or disprove our scientific theory.\n\n129\n00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.360\nFrom there we observe the result of that,\nand we go back again into theory.\n\n130\n00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:43.770\nInteresting enough this here\nhappens to be my company logo.\n\n131\n00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.890\nIf you look at it you could see that\nthe concept of the five elements\n\n132\n00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.600\nkinda exist in there.\n\n133\n00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.730\nIf you look at Cisco\nwheel of self defense,\n\n134\n00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.400\ncycle self defense it's right in there.\n\n135\n00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.760\nAnd because that's the way security is.\n\n136\n00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.085\nSecurity is a process.\n\n137\n00:07:59.085 --> 00:08:05.503\nIt's not just, I'm gonna do these five\nthings, then I'll be secure forever.\n\n138\n00:08:05.503 --> 00:08:09.533\nIf we don't really have any kind of\nstasis, we don't have any kind of balance,\n\n139\n00:08:09.533 --> 00:08:12.500\nwe're always checking it,\nwe're always looking at it.\n\n140\n00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.980\nIt's a constant ongoing process, and\nI think it's best understood that way.\n\n141\n00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:22.120\n>> Yeah and I like how you really put out\nthe fact that we have to plan in some way\n\n142\n00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.080\nshape or form, because coming at it just\nfrom a well guess we'll do this today, and\n\n143\n00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.060\nI guess I'll do that, you may, and\nit's like I think Ronnie likes to say,\n\n144\n00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.020\nit's like throwing darts at a wall.\n\n145\n00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.390\nAnd maybe every now and then you get\nthe right combination of things, and\n\n146\n00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.040\nit works, but\nthat's not a good way to go about it.\n\n147\n00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:42.985\nHaving a systematized approach to our\npenetration testing is gonna help us out,\n\n148\n00:08:42.985 --> 00:08:49.200\nbecause we're gonna be able to qualify and\nquantify our results, okay.\n\n149\n00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.847\nI tried to do this, was I successful?\n\n150\n00:08:50.847 --> 00:08:52.130\nYes or no?\n\n151\n00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:57.370\nAnd I did that for reasons, X, Y and\nZ, did they elicit reasons X, Y and Z?\n\n152\n00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:57.930\nYes or no?\n\n153\n00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.431\nYou start to have a nice system\ntowards things, and like you said,\n\n154\n00:09:01.431 --> 00:09:06.030\nkind of like the,\n>> Hypothesis or I'm sorry,\n\n155\n00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.805\nthe scientific method, right?\n\n156\n00:09:07.805 --> 00:09:09.635\nThe scientific method.\n\n157\n00:09:09.635 --> 00:09:12.795\nWe go through it, we look at the data,\nthen we go back, and we try again, and\n\n158\n00:09:12.795 --> 00:09:17.405\nsee, can we better do this, and how,\nwhere were our strengths and weaknesses.\n\n159\n00:09:17.405 --> 00:09:18.115\nWhere did we get it right?\n\n160\n00:09:18.115 --> 00:09:19.015\nWhere did we get it wrong?\n\n161\n00:09:19.015 --> 00:09:22.245\nIn the military,\nthey're called after-action reports.\n\n162\n00:09:22.245 --> 00:09:25.200\nLet's talk about what we did right,\nlet's talk about what we did wrong.\n\n163\n00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.620\nAnd now let's build a new plan based\non all that information we modified.\n\n164\n00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.330\n>> So,\nlike you've been saying all so time,\n\n165\n00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.970\nSocial Engineering is a data-metric\nmotivated type of process.\n\n166\n00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.720\nSo, we have to come up with a plan\nto do something before we can do it,\n\n167\n00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.440\notherwise, we'll just sound and\nfury signifying nothing, right?\n\n168\n00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.410\n>> Right, right [LAUGH].\n\n169\n00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:48.030\nYou try to, I dunno, talk to a woman,\nget her phone number.\n\n170\n00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:48.660\nIt didn't work.\n\n171\n00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.034\nYou say, experiment failed.\n\n172\n00:09:53.597 --> 00:09:55.740\nTry a different method.\n\n173\n00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.870\nTry a different woman.\n\n174\n00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:57.890\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n175\n00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.880\nModify the elements inside of your plan.\n\n176\n00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.650\nMaybe you need to lose a piece of\nthe plan, because it's just not working,\n\n177\n00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.890\nit's not doing what you need it to do.\n\n178\n00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.810\nSo now you try something different,\nadd it into it's place,\n\n179\n00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:10.920\nmaybe just remove it completely.\n\n180\n00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.210\nAnd that gets you the results.\n\n181\n00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.350\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n182\n00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:18.120\nSo this last chart up here probably\nsummarizes everything that we've said.\n\n183\n00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:27.910\nWe need to do researches, or\nresearch into our particular task.\n\n184\n00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:33.705\nLet's say that task is this\ncompany's soft on their email,\n\n185\n00:10:33.705 --> 00:10:39.565\ntheir personnel doesn't really seem\nto be following the process and\n\n186\n00:10:39.565 --> 00:10:43.585\nthe policy well, so\nthat's what we'd be able to extract.\n\n187\n00:10:43.585 --> 00:10:48.320\nThat is the area that we're going after in\nthis social engineering pen tests, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.750\nWhat are the resources that we have?\n\n189\n00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.420\nIs it one, two?\n\n190\n00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.650\nIs there a team?\n\n191\n00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.480\nHow many users are there?\n\n192\n00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.670\nHow much time do we have, and\ncertainly, how much money do we have?\n\n193\n00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.290\nJust how deep have we come into this?\n\n194\n00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:06.120\nSo we're hemmed in by that, or\n\n195\n00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.290\ngiven freedom by that by how much,\nhow deep our resources are.\n\n196\n00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:12.560\nWhat are our capabilities?\n\n197\n00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.160\n>> Is that strictly defined by, obviously,\n\n198\n00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.950\nwe're gonna know our own limitations,\nright?\n\n199\n00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.340\nI either have something,\nor I don't have something.\n\n200\n00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:25.020\nBut is that also part of that comes\nfrom what we're given permission to do.\n\n201\n00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.040\nIs that part of that as well?\n\n202\n00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.490\n>> Part of it what we're\ngiven permission to do, sure.\n\n203\n00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.640\nSo the resources might say,\nour limitations.\n\n204\n00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.181\nCertainly, we need knowledge.\n\n205\n00:11:38.181 --> 00:11:43.311\nWe need to understand how email works,\n\n206\n00:11:43.311 --> 00:11:48.597\nwhat are the headers, how to read them,\n\n207\n00:11:48.597 --> 00:11:51.561\nhow blacklists work.\n\n208\n00:11:51.561 --> 00:11:52.370\nNot only that,\n\n209\n00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.470\nwe need to understand the behaviors of\npeople that are clicking on emails.\n\n210\n00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.290\nWhat are they attracted towards?\n\n211\n00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:04.180\nI guarantee you that we could get\n\n212\n00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:09.240\nanyone to click on any email and\ngive it enough time.\n\n213\n00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.450\n>> I would agree with you.\n\n214\n00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:14.145\n>> I don't think anybody is immune to it.\n\n215\n00:12:14.145 --> 00:12:19.500\n[LAUGH] Send somebody a picture for\n\n216\n00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:24.840\nguys are pretty women for\nwomen a handsome man, and you're gonna.\n\n217\n00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.820\n>> Maybe a salacious story,\npeople love a good gossip.\n\n218\n00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.540\n>> Look at the whole Orlando bit today.\n\n219\n00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:39.240\nThe security wires are full of people\nnow trying to lure people in with\n\n220\n00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:45.590\nsolicitous emails and stories.\n\n221\n00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:49.430\nPoison pen letters that\nare drawing them in.\n\n222\n00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:50.910\nIt's sad, but it's true.\n\n223\n00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.280\nEverybody needs to be aware of that.\n\n224\n00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.040\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n225\n00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.970\nWe have to be aware that most\npeople have at least some\n\n226\n00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.799\nsense of saying well here's out of bounds,\nand here's within bounds.\n\n227\n00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:10.010\nPeople will use just about anything to get\nyou click on one of these emails, and now\n\n228\n00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:14.140\nyou've downloaded their Trojan which gives\nthem backdoor access into your system.\n\n229\n00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:19.180\nThey've gotten you to go to\na website that looks legitimate for\n\n230\n00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.780\na cause maybe you are interested in.\n\n231\n00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:26.127\nHey create a log in, sign in here, we're\nactually connected with this company or\n\n232\n00:13:26.127 --> 00:13:26.948\nthat company.\n\n233\n00:13:26.948 --> 00:13:31.454\nMake it look very legitimate, and then you\nlog in, you think you're using your proper\n\n234\n00:13:31.454 --> 00:13:34.739\ncredentials, or maybe credentials\nyou use on other systems.\n\n235\n00:13:34.739 --> 00:13:38.378\nYou think I'll use the same email address\nand password here as I do over there, and\n\n236\n00:13:38.378 --> 00:13:42.122\nyou create a login, and it really doesn't\ndo anything for you, maybe get a couple of\n\n237\n00:13:42.122 --> 00:13:46.340\nfake pages that you read through and\ngo and you lose interest and you are gone.\n\n238\n00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:50.656\nBut the attacker already now has\na username, they have a password.\n\n239\n00:13:50.656 --> 00:13:55.525\nThey have an email address,\nwhich has an actual person attached to it.\n\n240\n00:13:55.525 --> 00:13:58.680\nThey know where they can start spamming\nto get more information, right?\n\n241\n00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.470\nThese are the kind of things that we\ndefinitely need to keep a look out for.\n\n242\n00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:01.970\n>> Definitely.\n\n243\n00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:08.010\nNow, the last in that\ndiagram was objectives.\n\n244\n00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:16.890\nObjectives may change due to what\nweÂ´ve gathered out of our knowledge,\n\n245\n00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:21.930\nwe may decide that we need\nto go a little further.\n\n246\n00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.480\nPeople are pretty good at their email, but\n\n247\n00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.610\nthey're not too good\nwith their SMS messaging.\n\n248\n00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.090\nMost people aren't.\n\n249\n00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:33.590\nAnd I predict it is the next vector of,\nI mean,\n\n250\n00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.750\nyou can see it now coming\nas a form of advertisement.\n\n251\n00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:42.686\nI would say I received at least\nfive ads over the past week,\n\n252\n00:14:42.686 --> 00:14:49.550\nSMS wise, that,\nwell this guy knows I just bought a car.\n\n253\n00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.310\n>> Yeah.\n>> Theyâre telling me that Iâm\n\n254\n00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.540\navailable for another car loan,\nitâs like thatâs,\n\n255\n00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.170\nthatâs pretty crazy stuff,\nBluetooth advertising.\n\n256\n00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.360\nNonetheless, as I say,\nthe objective changed okay?\n\n257\n00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:11.020\nAll of that combined is what creates\nour potential for success, okay.\n\n258\n00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:15.490\nIf I don't have any money,\nthis thing's gonna collapse.\n\n259\n00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.850\nI don't really understand the systems.\n\n260\n00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.730\nThese things will collapse.\n\n261\n00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:20.710\nI don't have any research.\n\n262\n00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:24.070\nI really, you haven't really looked\ninto how many users do they have?\n\n263\n00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:27.660\nIt's gonna collapse, and if I don't really\nfollow the objectives, I don't really\n\n264\n00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.940\nbend with the flow of data coming in and\n\n265\n00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.810\nmodify my objectives,\nit's gonna collapse as well.\n\n266\n00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.780\nOkay.\nSo, what I'd like everybody to see is that\n\n267\n00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:45.460\nproject management really is\na dynamic ongoing process.\n\n268\n00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.760\n>> Yeah, not only that risk management.\n\n269\n00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.010\nIt's basically you put project\nmanagement in any kind of situation.\n\n270\n00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.340\nWe start talking about it.\n\n271\n00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.220\nRisk management comes along right with it,\n\n272\n00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.790\nbecause there's always going to be some\nsort of risk, some element of risk that\n\n273\n00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.540\nwe have to be on and ready for,\n>> Yeah.\n\n274\n00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.985\n>> Look out for,\nuse our risk matrix assessments.\n\n275\n00:16:02.985 --> 00:16:10.632\n>> A buddy of mine uses the Breakdown\nof the word risk in his CISSP class.\n\n276\n00:16:10.632 --> 00:16:14.870\nAnd said you know what risk means,\nyou know where it comes from?\n\n277\n00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:18.920\nIt comes from the root ris,\nwhich is Greek,\n\n278\n00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.440\nby the way,\nwhich defines rocks underwater.\n\n279\n00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:31.930\nHence someone sailing along a level ocean\ncan't see those rocks, and yet they're\n\n280\n00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:38.040\nthere and until somebody really maps that\nout you're at risk to sink the ship.\n\n281\n00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.820\n>> Really good analogy!\n\n282\n00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.540\n>> It's a good analogy, yeah.\n\n283\n00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:48.670\n>> To think of, you can't foresee these\nthings all you can do is try to predict\n\n284\n00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:49.960\n>> Where a great risk and\n\n285\n00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.940\nwhere a minimal risk is.\n\n286\n00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.350\nAnd then, map out as well as\nyou can through testing and\n\n287\n00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.430\nthese types phases that\nwe're talking about.\n\n288\n00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:03.105\nSo, that you can better risk assess\nyour situation, what is the likelihood.\n\n289\n00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:03.605\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Right.\n\n290\n00:17:03.605 --> 00:17:04.534\n>> Of someone gaining access\n\n291\n00:17:04.534 --> 00:17:05.051\nto a system.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n292\n00:17:05.051 --> 00:17:06.135\n>> Right.\n\n293\n00:17:06.135 --> 00:17:06.775\n>> And that's really what\n\n294\n00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:07.300\nwe're getting now.\n\n295\n00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.270\n>> Right, right.\n\n296\n00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:13.790\nAnd this last diagram, I really\nborrow from my risk management class,\n\n297\n00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:20.070\nwhich kinda just reiterates those\nthree elements, the requirements.\n\n298\n00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:21.920\nWhat do we need to do?\n\n299\n00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:27.190\nOkay, the resources that we have, the\nmoney involved, right, and then the time.\n\n300\n00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:32.600\nI don't care if you build a shed out\nbehind the house, you needed it up for\n\n301\n00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.240\nme the vital number.\n\n302\n00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:40.418\nYou wanna try to get it in before\nthe storm comes or whatever and man.\n\n303\n00:17:40.418 --> 00:17:44.390\nI got a hundred dollars to do it.\n\n304\n00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.070\n>> Yeah.\n>> But, sometimes you have to stretch it.\n\n305\n00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:47.880\nYou told me, you done some construction.\n\n306\n00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.340\n>> I've done some construction n the past.\n\n307\n00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.290\nSo It all depends the customer\ndoesn't wanna pay that much for\n\n308\n00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.950\ntheir job they're only gonna\nget that kind of a job.\n\n309\n00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:00.760\n>> And what's interesting is using\nthis is a great little matrix that you\n\n310\n00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.150\nhave here or diagram, because it breaks\nit down and makes it very simple for\n\n311\n00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:08.910\nus to understand, but\nit also really gives us a pretty good\n\n312\n00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:13.030\nstarting point to create a plan to say\nokay what are the requirements of the job.\n\n313\n00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.350\nIf I'm pen testing through\nthe means of social engineering,\n\n314\n00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.190\nwhat of this it that they\nwant me to get out of this?\n\n315\n00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:19.840\nDo they want me to see if I\ncan get past the front desk?\n\n316\n00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.180\nDo they want me to see if I can\naccess servers or sensitive data?\n\n317\n00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.960\nHow is it that they're utilizing me?\n\n318\n00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.840\nWhat are my requirements then?\n\n319\n00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.365\nWhat are my resources based\nbasically the money, right?\n\n320\n00:18:29.365 --> 00:18:33.855\nHow do I use the resources I have at\nhand to fulfill the requirements?\n\n321\n00:18:33.855 --> 00:18:37.745\nAnd do I have the time, can I work\nwithin the time constraints given?\n\n322\n00:18:37.745 --> 00:18:40.555\nIf I have no time constraints,\ngreat, cuz that's always nice.\n\n323\n00:18:40.555 --> 00:18:44.110\nAnd usually a bad guy has no time Strings.\n\n324\n00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:49.070\nHe knows that he can just continue\nto work against the system\n\n325\n00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:53.320\nas long as necessary because there's\nno boss over his head going,\n\n326\n00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.840\nyou have to get this done\nby Thursday at 3:00 PM or\n\n327\n00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.540\nthe board is going to be just up in\narms about your report not being in.\n\n328\n00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.120\nThey're bad guys.\n\n329\n00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:00.730\nThey don't care.\n\n330\n00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:01.840\nThey've got all the time in the world.\n\n331\n00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.570\nI would have said that black hats,\n\n332\n00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:09.750\none thing they have on their side is time,\nand all we can do is mitigate, mitigate,\n\n333\n00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.910\nmitigate, and hopefully we increase\nthat amount of time that it takes for\n\n334\n00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:16.040\nthem if they have targeted\nus to get into our system.\n\n335\n00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.460\nSo we use this as a nice platform for\ncreating a really good plan,\n\n336\n00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.660\nand it doesn't have to\nbe overly complicated.\n\n337\n00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.220\nThat's why I really like this often,\nit's great, and so,\n\n338\n00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.400\nanyway, at this point I\nsay we defined our target.\n\n339\n00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.120\nWe have a particular bank\nthat we're going after.\n\n340\n00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:38.230\nWhat are the targets at the bank?\n\n341\n00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.360\nHow many branches do they have?\n\n342\n00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.150\nI guess we could drop the triple\nconstraints at this point, but\n\n343\n00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:50.680\nthere's a good one to remember\nIs it a walking bank?\n\n344\n00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:54.230\nI mean are we responsible for\ndealing with the tellers in the bank?\n\n345\n00:19:55.510 --> 00:20:03.520\nDo they have their bank by phone,\ncomputer based banking system.\n\n346\n00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.980\nAre we going after the computer\nbased banking system?\n\n347\n00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.160\nAre we going after the phone system?\n\n348\n00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.910\nAre we going after the towers?\n\n349\n00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:14.490\nSo, i think in that case we need to really\nsuper define what those things are.\n\n350\n00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:20.588\nMaybe it's gonna be a web-type\n\n351\n00:20:20.588 --> 00:20:25.640\npen test isn't necessarily human\n\n352\n00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:31.070\nsocial engineering, but it still would be\ncharacteristics, and I don't think that\n\n353\n00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:36.012\na social engineer is necessarily\njust going to be doing personal\n\n354\n00:20:36.012 --> 00:20:41.380\npersonal type stuff.I mean I generally\ndon't, I becomes an element.\n\n355\n00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:46.890\nDo you want the human pen test\npackage as part of that deal?\n\n356\n00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:50.880\nOr should we,\nare we just going after your firewall?\n\n357\n00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.594\nSo we gotta check your\naccess control list?\n\n358\n00:20:56.566 --> 00:21:00.445\nAll right Tom,\nwhere do we go to next from here?\n\n359\n00:21:00.445 --> 00:21:02.755\n>> Well, so what we're looking for\n\n360\n00:21:02.755 --> 00:21:09.525\nis, once we've nailed down that target,\nwhat do they do?\n\n361\n00:21:09.525 --> 00:21:10.699\nWhat's their job function?\n\n362\n00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.410\nWhat kind of information\ndo they hold on to?\n\n363\n00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.800\nYou want to be able to detail\nthat as best as you can.\n\n364\n00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.060\nWhat services and products do they offer?\n\n365\n00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.060\nWhat's the line?\n\n366\n00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.930\nIf it's a vacuum cleaner company\nhow many different vacuum cleaners\n\n367\n00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:26.870\ndo they deal with?\n\n368\n00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:31.405\nIt may be useful because you may get in\nto a conversation with somebody that's\n\n369\n00:21:31.405 --> 00:21:34.849\nat a vacuum cleaner conference\nthat you happened to went to\n\n370\n00:21:37.284 --> 00:21:41.615\nEngineered your way in through the door\nand then sought out this particular person\n\n371\n00:21:41.615 --> 00:21:45.471\njust to talk about vacuums after and\nthey were really excite about them.\n\n372\n00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:46.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n373\n00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:49.270\nyou were able from there to\n>> I\n\n374\n00:21:49.270 -->

know\n\n376\n00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:58.550\nback in promo companies they are trying to\nyou're are trying to find out what their\n\n377\n00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.870\nsales are like or\nwhat their plan for the future is.\n\n378\n00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:02.150\n>> Kinda coopriate espionage right?\n\n379\n00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.070\n>> Yeah kind of coorpriate.\n\n380\n00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:07.120\n>> And you know it makes me,I keep using\nFrank Abgnale, because I think he's such\n\n381\n00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:12.420\na prime example of an actual social\nengineer is that he learned all about.\n\n382\n00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.270\n>> The different airplanes\nhow the big they were how\n\n383\n00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.450\nfar they can fly where their routes were.\n\n384\n00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:20.880\nHe learnt a lot about what\nit was like to be a pilot\n\n385\n00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.090\nin though he wasn't one\nhe was just a young man.\n\n386\n00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:26.370\nSo that he can speak intelligently\nwith other pilots and\n\n387\n00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:30.770\nwhat did that do that make them think\nhe's one of us he speaks our lingo,\n\n388\n00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.730\nand therefor he was accepted\ninto their circle of people.\n\n389\n00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.130\n>> Yeah, and-\n>> Probably no one ever thought\n\n390\n00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:36.640\nof the thing.\n\n391\n00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:43.850\n>> You probably use the most cardinal\nrule in conning, which is likability.\n\n392\n00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:44.360\n>> Mm.\n\n393\n00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:51.430\n>> He knew how to schmooze his way\ninto dituation an environment.\n\n394\n00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:55.550\nYou do have a kind of frame the person,\nbut he had that ability to actually look\n\n395\n00:22:55.550 --> 00:23:00.490\nat somebody to see really what\nare their likes and dislikes were,\n\n396\n00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:05.126\nand now to navigate his way\nthrough their human firewall.\n\n397\n00:23:05.126 --> 00:23:10.150\nSo, all right,\n\n398\n00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:17.060\nwe've gathered our information,\nwe understand what the task is at hand,\n\n399\n00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:21.250\nwe've got a plan of action now,\nwe've got our documents, right,\n\n400\n00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:26.950\nwe've got our signed get out of jail card,\nand so at this point,\n\n401\n00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:31.990\nwe need some way to organize\nthe information that we collect.\n\n402\n00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:36.340\nI mean, you could, I'm the type,\nI have a little notebook.\n\n403\n00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.500\nI like to write things down and\nI go back, say,\n\n404\n00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.150\nI got tons and tons of notebooks, okay.\n\n405\n00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:46.667\nI find, actually, writing stuff, pen and\npaper actually works better for me,\n\n406\n00:23:46.667 --> 00:23:49.010\nbut there's a couple great\ntools that are out there.\n\n407\n00:23:52.814 --> 00:23:57.920\nI'm gonna jump through these,\nso one of which is Altego.\n\n408\n00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.766\nOkay, so pop that diagram bring Altego up.\n\n409\n00:24:00.766 --> 00:24:06.875\nSo Altego is a information\ngathering program\n\n410\n00:24:06.875 --> 00:24:12.018\nthat will allow you to take a domain and\n\n411\n00:24:12.018 --> 00:24:16.372\nthen harvest Email addresses.\n\n412\n00:24:16.372 --> 00:24:18.540\nIt's pretty extensive and\nit goes pretty deep.\n\n413\n00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:22.280\nFrom here you can find all the locations,\n\n414\n00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:27.210\nall the branches,\nall the connections between them.\n\n415\n00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.510\nIt'll map and diagram it out for you.\n\n416\n00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:34.450\nSo it gives you a great\nplace to start digging in.\n\n417\n00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:43.321\nMaltego by the way, I like to run Linux\nKali as by as my pen testing machine.\n\n418\n00:24:43.321 --> 00:24:45.590\nI also use it as a development machine.\n\n419\n00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:49.440\nSo, I'll run virtual\nenvironments in it so,\n\n420\n00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.470\nyou can actually take Kali,\nput VirtualBox in it.\n\n421\n00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:57.045\nSet up a bunch of virtual machines and\n\n422\n00:24:57.045 --> 00:25:01.375\nstart practicing your own\nphysical pen testing right there.\n\n423\n00:25:01.375 --> 00:25:06.738\nI don't know anybody socially engineered\nSiri or anything like that [LAUGH] but\n\n424\n00:25:06.738 --> 00:25:10.160\nthat would be a great little program,\nactually.\n\n425\n00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.882\n>> Well, it does learn your habits and-\n>> Your likes and your dislikes, right?\n\n426\n00:25:12.882 --> 00:25:13.795\n>> I tricked you!\n\n427\n00:25:13.795 --> 00:25:17.628\n>> Maybe you could trick Siri into\nthinking you're something you're not.\n\n428\n00:25:17.628 --> 00:25:23.463\n>> So another is [INAUDIBLE] which is more\na way of collecting your information and\n\n429\n00:25:23.463 --> 00:25:25.270\nthen organizing that.\n\n430\n00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:30.238\nIt runs natively in Kali as well.\n\n431\n00:25:30.238 --> 00:25:33.400\n>> KeepNote is another Linux product that,\n\n432\n00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.644\nit's like a notebook that\nallows you to take graphics,\n\n433\n00:25:37.644 --> 00:25:42.450\nsome type of stuff that you've\nwritten down and compile them.\n\n434\n00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:47.020\nAnd then you can have another, send it\nto another person, people can add to it.\n\n435\n00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:51.830\n>> If you're a Windows user,\nthen OneNote would be a great thing to\n\n436\n00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:58.900\nuse because OneNote you can take voice,\n\n437\n00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.550\nvideo, scribble notes,\nsomething you scanned in.\n\n438\n00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.800\nYou'll build it in the notepads and\n\n439\n00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.010\nthen you can actually share it so\nthat you can pass it around your team.\n\n440\n00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:12.210\nSo I think that that's really,\nreally helpful.\n\n441\n00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:18.400\nOne more I don't have a video for\nis, we can drop that,\n\n442\n00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:23.456\nand we're going to run like in module 8,\n\n443\n00:26:23.456 --> 00:26:29.080\nwhen we get into actual real tools that\nare used, a program called Cobalt Strike.\n\n444\n00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:34.630\nSo Cobalt Strike allows you\nto do spear fishing testing.\n\n445\n00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.193\nSpear fishing expeditions and\n\n446\n00:26:38.193 --> 00:26:42.635\nto share the results with your team.\n\n447\n00:26:42.635 --> 00:26:46.435\nSo if you've got a red team and\nyou're working on this type of project,\n\n448\n00:26:46.435 --> 00:26:48.935\neverybody can actually be live,\nadding to it.\n\n449\n00:26:48.935 --> 00:26:51.157\nSo you got a little chatroom\nlike we have here, okay?\n\n450\n00:26:51.157 --> 00:26:55.737\nSo yeah, yeah, I see they picked up,\nso and so, and\n\n451\n00:26:55.737 --> 00:26:58.874\nclick through that link we can see.\n\n452\n00:27:02.162 --> 00:27:06.534\nThe thing with Cobalt Strike\nas a pen testing tool,\n\n453\n00:27:06.534 --> 00:27:11.250\nit allows you to drop these\nlisteners into an e-mail.\n\n454\n00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:14.944\nThey're virtually undetected and\n\n455\n00:27:14.944 --> 00:27:20.368\nin most cases we use a thing\ncalled threat modeling.\n\n456\n00:27:20.368 --> 00:27:24.655\nWhere we want to try to detect and\nsee just how users\n\n457\n00:27:24.655 --> 00:27:30.090\nare working as well as what's\ngoing on inside of a system.\n\n458\n00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:31.990\nIt's known to have been had already.\n\n459\n00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.960\n>> That's a pretty cool piece of software.\n\n460\n00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.710\n>> It's a great program.\n\n461\n00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:42.700\nI love it,\none my favorite pen testing tools.\n\n462\n00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.230\n>> So it's a way for\nus to basically collaborate.\n\n463\n00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.972\n>> Collaborate, right.\n\n464\n00:27:45.972 --> 00:27:48.804\n>> As a group together and\nwork as a team instead of individually and\n\n465\n00:27:48.804 --> 00:27:50.190\nthen bring it together.\n\n466\n00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.710\n>> Right.\n\n467\n00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.370\nAnd it's not just a spear fishing deal.\n\n468\n00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.710\nYou can create a web drive by.\n\n469\n00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:00.298\nYou can certainly list\nall the machines that\n\n470\n00:28:00.298 --> 00:28:05.420\nyou have n-mapped, so\nit'll run n-map native.\n\n471\n00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:11.170\nIt used to,\nthe new version doesn't run any type of\n\n472\n00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:16.860\nMetasploit in it, but the tool itself is-\n>> Yeah, it sounds a lot like Armitage.\n\n473\n00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:23.730\n>> Armitage is the little baby brother\nof Cobalt Strike, so Armitage is free.\n\n474\n00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:27.535\nRaphael Mudge actually\ncreated both programs, but\n\n475\n00:28:27.535 --> 00:28:31.920\nCobalt Strike has a couple\nthousand dollar price to it.\n\n476\n00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.410\n>> So it's the same,\nbased on the same ideas.\n\n477\n00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:35.210\n>> For the big boys though.\n\n478\n00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:38.120\n>> Armitage doesn't have\nthe spear fishing module.\n\n479\n00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:38.813\n>> Gotcha.\n>> So, and\n\n480\n00:28:38.813 --> 00:28:41.468\nthat's really good because\nif you're a pen tester,\n\n481\n00:28:41.468 --> 00:28:44.537\nyou've got a company that you're\ncontracted to do work for,\n\n482\n00:28:44.537 --> 00:28:48.216\nand you're trying to train them,\nyou're constantly going to use that.\n\n483\n00:28:48.216 --> 00:28:53.603\nSend in your different email attacks,\nand you get some results.\n\n484\n00:28:53.603 --> 00:28:58.155\nAnd you can now have a report that\nyou could actually present to your\n\n485\n00:28:58.155 --> 00:28:59.699\nclient that says hey,\n\n486\n00:28:59.699 --> 00:29:05.450\nwe've been very successful with getting\n60% of users to click on this link.\n\n487\n00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:08.902\n>> Now Tom, really quickly, one of our\nusers in the chatroom is asking about\n\n488\n00:29:08.902 --> 00:29:10.753\nthe tools that we are discussing here.\n\n489\n00:29:10.753 --> 00:29:14.159\nIs that available directly from or\ninside Kali Linux or\n\n490\n00:29:14.159 --> 00:29:17.128\nwould you have to amass\nthose things yourself?\n\n491\n00:29:17.128 --> 00:29:20.297\nAnd if that's the case, can we get\nthem a list of [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n\n492\n00:29:20.297 --> 00:29:24.459\n>> Yeah, Maltego is in Kali Linux,\n\n493\n00:29:24.459 --> 00:29:28.926\nKeepNote are all in there.\n\n494\n00:29:28.926 --> 00:29:34.690\nYou could probably run OneNote\nin Linux if you wanted.\n\n495\n00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:37.968\nI don't know why you would, but\n\n496\n00:29:37.968 --> 00:29:43.150\nArmitage is built in,\nbut Cobalt Strike isn't.\n\n497\n00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:44.420\n>> Right because it's a pay.\n\n498\n00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:47.330\n>> It's a pay, but\nthere is a free version.\n\n499\n00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:48.560\n>> Yeah.\n\n500\n00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:54.940\nThere's a community version that will\ngive you some limited capabilities.\n\n501\n00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.116\nCertainly enough to understand it and\nplay with it.\n\n502\n00:29:57.116 --> 00:29:57.972\n>> That's good to know.\n\n503\n00:29:57.972 --> 00:30:00.943\n>> Yeah, you know you can run it for\n30 days and then uninstall it,\n\n504\n00:30:00.943 --> 00:30:02.355\nre-install it again, yeah.\n\n505\n00:30:02.355 --> 00:30:04.170\n>> Excellent, I like that.\n\n506\n00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:04.775\nI love free.\n\n507\n00:30:04.775 --> 00:30:07.918\nFree.99 is my favorite\nprice on Earth [LAUGH].\n\n508\n00:30:07.918 --> 00:30:10.240\nThat being said, Tom,\nI'm looking at our clock.\n\n509\n00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.167\nWe've definitely ticked\ndown our last seconds.\n\n510\n00:30:12.167 --> 00:30:13.543\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Hey.\n\n511\n00:30:13.543 --> 00:30:14.215\n>> I know it goes by so quickly.\n\n512\n00:30:14.215 --> 00:30:15.149\n>> Yeah, it flew by.\n\n513\n00:30:15.149 --> 00:30:18.809\n>> But, I know you have more to talk\nabout when it comes to the second phase,\n\n514\n00:30:18.809 --> 00:30:20.135\nright over second phase.\n\n515\n00:30:20.135 --> 00:30:21.309\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Second phase, right.\n\n516\n00:30:21.309 --> 00:30:22.673\n>> Really getting into planning in that.\n\n517\n00:30:22.673 --> 00:30:25.960\nSo, it looks like we're into\na part two for our future here.\n\n518\n00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.390\nI look forward to seeing you there.\n\n519\n00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.090\nAll right, Tom, thanks for\njoining us today.\n\n520\n00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:30.500\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n521\n00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.380\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off, for ITProTV,\n\n522\n00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.040\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n523\n00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.150\n>> I'm Tom Uptigrove.\n\n524\n00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:40.002\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n525\n00:30:40.002 --> 00:30:46.920\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Yeah.\n>> I got two cameras on me right this.\n\n48\n00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.140\nThis moment in time.\n\n49\n00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.560\n>> Yeah, is that one device for\ntwo cameras or.\n\n50\n00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.480\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> No, at every time.\n\n51\n00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.810\n>> It's 2 different devices.\n\n52\n00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.370\n>> One camera each.\n\n53\n00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.180\n>> It's amazing.\n\n54\n00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.400\n>> It really is.\n\n55\n00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.600\n>> Down to the last scene where,\nI don't know if you could pick that off.\n\n56\n00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.790\nWhat I was really trying to drill with\nthe guy with glass up to the wall,\n\n57\n00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.120\nwhich we all see and it happens.\n\n58\n00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.140\nI mean, just eavesdropping and\neavesdropping is a skill.\n\n59\n00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.150\nIt's a talent, that and\nsocial engineer be better.\n\n60\n00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.870\nWe didn't see any lip reading, but\nlip reading would be part of it,\n\n61\n00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.740\nlearning how to tail somebody so\ninconspicuously.\n\n62\n00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.740\nSo we're coming back to some of\nthe little spy techniques you\n\n63\n00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.340\never see the movie the mechanic with James\nBronson or Charles Bronson I'm sorry.\n\n64\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.960\nHe's got that telephoto lens and he's\nwatching them have a conversation, and\n\n65\n00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.120\nlip reading in live in real time it was,\nso\n\n66\n00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.480\nit was one of the coolest\nscenes I've ever seen.\n\n67\n00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.330\n>> It's the camera is used extensively\nin social engineering there's no doubt\n\n68\n00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.400\nabout it, it's a great tool.\n\n69\n00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.640\n>> So we have to start guarding against\nthings like that, that's one of the things\n\n70\n00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.480\nwe can take away from here is\n>> Using things like the screen filter\n\n71\n00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.310\nsquare, only if you're directly\nin front of a computer screen.\n\n72\n00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.930\n>> That's right.\n\n73\n00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.520\n>> Not pointing it toward people\nwho shouldn't be seeing the screen.\n\n74\n00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.640\n>> Sure.\nStanding in front of the keypad,\n\n75\n00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.680\nrather than showing access to it.\n\n76\n00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.730\nDon't be afraid to cover.\n\n77\n00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.700\n>> It's so funny how,\n>> We almost feel like we're offending\n\n78\n00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.500\nthe people around us by covering\na keypad saying, okay, don't look here.\n\n79\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.360\nAnd like the person behind me is gonna go,\nwell you don't trust me,\n\n80\n00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.235\nI don't care about-\n>> And that's a great exploit right there.\n\n81\n00:04:57.235 --> 00:04:59.650\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> To actually shame somebody,\n\n82\n00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.770\nyou see well you don't trust me?\n\n83\n00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.790\nThere's something, you have point.\n\n84\n00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:05.400\n>> Yeah.\n\n85\n00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.478\n>> Yeah.\n>> What are you trying to say?\n\n86\n00:05:06.478 --> 00:05:07.660\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n87\n00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.430\n>> Is that right?\n\n88\n00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.920\n>> This happens all the time.\n\n89\n00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.480\nI feel it myself, right,\nwhen I'm staying at a key pad.\n\n90\n00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.430\nI used to be a little more brash in\nmy younger days when I would just\n\n91\n00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.040\nhappily offend somebody.\n\n92\n00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.360\nBut now that I'm older, a little wiser,\n\n93\n00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.880\nyou kinda feel bad like,\nI'm not trying to offend you.\n\n94\n00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.760\nI just don't know who you are.\n\n95\n00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:31.480\nAnd I have a modicum of paranoia that I\nthink is healthy when it comes to things\n\n96\n00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.310\nlike guarding my credit card pins, and my\nsensitive information that I should have.\n\n97\n00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.635\n>> Right, and I think\n>> That's a thing we're going to need to\n\n98\n00:05:38.635 --> 00:05:43.925\nunderstand, to have that modicum\nof paranoia and caution.\n\n99\n00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:47.855\nOne of the things that we'll present here,\n\n100\n00:05:47.855 --> 00:05:52.842\nreally, is the Carl Sagan's BS detector.\n\n101\n00:05:52.842 --> 00:05:54.340\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n102\n00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.810\n>> Which is important because as we\nstart to go into this next area,\n\n103\n00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.880\nwhich is really biases, how\n\n104\n00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.690\ndo we really logically\nmake sense out of things?\n\n105\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.100\nHow do we verify things?\n\n106\n00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:14.680\nWe were talking earlier about\n>> Just verify the source\n\n107\n00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.155\nand who are your sources, and\nreally try to understand where\n\n108\n00:06:20.155 --> 00:06:26.093\nthe authoritative expert\n\n109\n00:06:26.093 --> 00:06:31.810\nwould be,\nsomebody that can define something truly.\n\n110\n00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.320\nSo one of the things that we\ncome up against, actually,\n\n111\n00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.990\nis in analyzing this data because\nthat we have all this data,\n\n112\n00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:45.040\nbut we really haven't\nmade sense of it yet.\n\n113\n00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:51.140\nWe need to know the best way to use our\nresources and to implement that plan.\n\n114\n00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.050\nBut some things that maybe\n\n115\n00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.910\nfactor in understanding it is what\nis called cognitive dissonance.\n\n116\n00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.840\nSay, so cognitive dissonance is when we\nhave like two opposing points of view for\n\n117\n00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.820\ninstances, on one side we're thought\nto be honest truthful, forthright,\n\n118\n00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:22.110\nand to, really,\nto tell the truth when we do something.\n\n119\n00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:28.050\nAnd at the same time, as a social\nengineer, you're lying, deceiving,\n\n120\n00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.530\nmisrepresenting things, okay,\nand being truly dishonest.\n\n121\n00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:37.590\nGetting from people things that you\nreally shouldn't be getting from them.\n\n122\n00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.936\nIt's going to hurt them, embarrass them,\nand probably get them fired.\n\n123\n00:07:40.936 --> 00:07:47.802\nAnd so, it can be a problem and you may\nas a social engineer be up against that,\n\n124\n00:07:47.802 --> 00:07:52.557\nboy, and if I really tell\nthem really what happened,\n\n125\n00:07:52.557 --> 00:07:55.641\nall these people go, you can't.\n\n126\n00:07:55.641 --> 00:08:01.401\nOn the other hand you might be the type of\nperson to say, hey, you know, you did it.\n\n127\n00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:02.278\nYou should be working here.\n\n128\n00:08:02.278 --> 00:08:03.446\nYou really should be.\n\n129\n00:08:03.446 --> 00:08:05.298\nShould be in charge of all that money.\n\n130\n00:08:05.298 --> 00:08:07.264\n>> Yeah it's really difficult for\n\n131\n00:08:07.264 --> 00:08:11.830\nus to, I'm sure most of us will\nstruggle with that kind of thing.\n\n132\n00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:12.670\nI know that I would.\n\n133\n00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.530\nI would think well I've been tasked to\n\n134\n00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:21.850\nfind out the weaknesses as far as\npersonnel goes and I've found some.\n\n135\n00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.040\nAnd maybe this isn't the right job for\n\n136\n00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.990\nthem because they are not suited for\nthat type of environment.\n\n137\n00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:32.970\nThey have a hard time acclimating\nto a system that requires them\n\n138\n00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.470\nto act to certain way that they\ndon't actually act that day.\n\n139\n00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.020\n>> Right, right.\n\n140\n00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.840\n>> So it can be difficult for us I'm sure.\n\n141\n00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.780\n>> What is difficult?\n\n142\n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:45.420\nLet's take the next concept the what\nwhat we call cognitive disparity.\n\n143\n00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:55.020\nWhich basically says are you taking\nfactors of race, national origin,\n\n144\n00:08:55.020 --> 00:09:01.320\nsex, sexual disposition,\nare any of these factors, social standing?\n\n145\n00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.090\nAltering your analysis of the information.\n\n146\n00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:13.910\nI did a study,\na couple years ago on security video.\n\n147\n00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.780\nAnd one of the things that we saw\nfrom security video was that,\n\n148\n00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:25.010\nespecially in England, where ten\nyears ago there was one camera for\n\n149\n00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.340\nevery four people, in London alone.\n\n150\n00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.610\nThe English really big with security.\n\n151\n00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.890\nAnd their systems are a little different\nbecause they'll have a camera set up,\n\n152\n00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:41.807\nwhich is a communal camera spying\n\n153\n00:09:41.807 --> 00:09:45.631\non the setup.\n\n154\n00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:49.120\nSo they found that\nthe operators of the cameras,\n\n155\n00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.910\nlike one race would pick another\n\n156\n00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:00.630\nrace as their other people that would look\non it, they would overlook other things.\n\n157\n00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:05.190\nGuys would actually be watching women,\nmaybe women the other way.\n\n158\n00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:10.630\nSo, they found that the operators\nthemselves, because of their disparity,\n\n159\n00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:16.100\nbecause of their human thoughts and\nfeelings and\n\n160\n00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:21.770\nemotions, distorted what\nreally should be looked at.\n\n161\n00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.530\nHence can you really be equal about this,\n\n162\n00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:30.060\ncan you really be fair and\nhonest and do the job?\n\n163\n00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.600\nAre you gonna do the job to satisfy your\nown emotion, you gonna do the job to\n\n164\n00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.570\nsatisfy your manager or your boss or\nwhoever you're doing the job for?\n\n165\n00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.380\nIt's really something to consider and\nto look at.\n\n166\n00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.500\n>> Yeah, the human element of the system.\n\n167\n00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.840\n>> Yeah, we gotta really go into\nthe psychological elements.\n\n168\n00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:57.510\nWe're gonna kinda deal into more\nof that at this point, okay?\n\n169\n00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.090\n>> Interesting stuff, Tom.\n\n170\n00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.260\nThat being said,\nI do find that kind of thing fascinating.\n\n171\n00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.310\nBecause you're right.\n\n172\n00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.460\nEverybody's got presuppositions and\nbiases and\n\n173\n00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.490\nprejudices that they bring to the table,\nand\n\n174\n00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:12.200\nit all influences the type of information\nor what they think about the information.\n\n175\n00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.890\nIt's like it's a filter in which\nthey process things through,\n\n176\n00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.540\nand it can tend to skew things and\nit's our job to try to.\n\n177\n00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.730\n>> It will screw things.\n\n178\n00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.390\n>> Yeah, yeah.\nIt's our job to try to eliminate that as\n\n179\n00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.050\nmuch as possible to get down to raw data.\n\n180\n00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.580\n>> Yeah, I guess it's really why you\nhave a number of people in a jury.\n\n181\n00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.290\n>> Right.\n\n182\n00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:30.800\n>> You know?\n\n183\n00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.192\nYeah, who was up the one person.\n\n184\n00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:33.800\nYeah.\n>> [LAUGH] That would\n\n185\n00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.490\nbe a scary proposition, wouldn't it?\n\n186\n00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.470\n>> Right.\nSome of the other things we really need to\n\n187\n00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:43.760\nlook at is really just the disguise and\nthe camouflage of the subjects themselves.\n\n188\n00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.160\nOkay.\nThey know that they are being watched.\n\n189\n00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:51.610\nFor instance are there\nways to hide your email\n\n190\n00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.725\nfrom being scrapped by a tool?\n\n191\n00:11:56.725 --> 00:12:02.140\nThere's a tool called the Harvester, which\nyou run it against the domain name and\n\n192\n00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.020\nthat will bring back\nall of the emails that\n\n193\n00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.970\nare associated with that\nare somewhere out on the net.\n\n194\n00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.700\nOr you can run through a website, and\n\n195\n00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.740\njust do a scrub all the website, pull\ndown all the email addresses is there.\n\n196\n00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:23.030\nSo what techniques do people use to\nobfuscate those email addresses?\n\n197\n00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:28.620\nSome people will put their\nemail address as a text,\n\n198\n00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.300\nnot as a text but as a JPEG, so\n\n199\n00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.690\nthat way you're not going to be able\nto run through the characters that way.\n\n200\n00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:37.624\n>> It just pulls back an image and\nnot text.\n\n201\n00:12:37.624 --> 00:12:38.921\n>> Exactly.\n\n202\n00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:42.596\n>> Now we also would have to,\nI'd be nice to be able to, and\n\n203\n00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:47.292\nI'm sure they can in certain ways,\nuse things like this information to\n\n204\n00:12:47.292 --> 00:12:50.000\nhelp [INAUDIBLE]\n>> I think this information\n\n205\n00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.558\nis really important.\n\n206\n00:12:51.558 --> 00:12:53.060\nIt is gonna be more important for\n\n207\n00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:57.870\nus as we go on because naturally,\nall of your information is out there.\n\n208\n00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.856\nIf you wanted to be discreet about thing,\n\n209\n00:13:00.856 --> 00:13:04.040\nyou are gonna have to put out this\ninformation in order to do that.\n\n210\n00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.190\nThat's something that a social\nengineer really should understand,\n\n211\n00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:15.030\nthe techniques of how to\ndisguise their own movements.\n\n212\n00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.120\nFor instance, should you,\n\n213\n00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.609\nI mean really should you put all of your\ninformation out there on the social world?\n\n214\n00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.870\nThere's something to be said\nabout raising personal history.\n\n215\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:29.770\nEspecially if you were into\na more cover occupation,\n\n216\n00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:33.390\nlike a spy which is just another\nform of social engineer.\n\n217\n00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:34.230\n>> Right.\n\n218\n00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:39.111\n>> Going deeper,\nyou don't want your face known,\n\n219\n00:13:39.111 --> 00:13:45.910\nyou don't want people just look it up and\nsay, he works for the FBI.\n\n220\n00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:46.980\n>> Let's find out everything we can.\n\n221\n00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:47.890\nLet's look at his Facebook.\n\n222\n00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:48.730\nLet's look at his Twitter.\n\n223\n00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:49.860\nLet's do this, that, and the other.\n\n224\n00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.730\nIf I understand correctly,\nthat's why things like the Tor network,\n\n225\n00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.975\nthe Darknet or the Dark web,\nwas actually created for\n\n226\n00:13:57.975 --> 00:14:02.680\nthis purposes of sending\nclandestine information across\n\n227\n00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:08.000\nan internet connection without it\nbeing picked up by a passerby, right?\n\n228\n00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.050\n>> Yeah.\n\n229\n00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.570\nYeah, now you've got apps at this point,\nwhere, even phone apps,\n\n230\n00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:18.890\nwhere I can send an encrypted text message\nto anybody else that's using the app.\n\n231\n00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:19.890\nIt's called Signal.\n\n232\n00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:20.710\n>> Yeah.\n>> Kinda cool.\n\n233\n00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:21.280\n>> Yeah.\n\n234\n00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.810\n>> And as well,\nI can have an encrypted phone message.\n\n235\n00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:29.550\nAnd so\nI would say actually when working on\n\n236\n00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:34.430\na particular job it would be helpful for\nyou to do these types of things.\n\n237\n00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:40.100\nSo you want to mask your\ntrail as best as possible.\n\n238\n00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.390\nBut you gonna find you gonna come\nup against people like this.\n\n239\n00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:50.905\nAnother thing is just common sense,\nlike intelligence.\n\n240\n00:14:50.905 --> 00:14:55.160\nI don't know,\nyou're trying to find the right mark,\n\n241\n00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.760\ntrying to find the right person.\n\n242\n00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:07.761\nYou're never gonna convince\nsomebody who's a creationist.\n\n243\n00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:11.906\nThat the world is, as some would believe,\n\n244\n00:15:11.906 --> 00:15:16.290\nsix to ten thousand years old and\nvice versa.\n\n245\n00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.600\nI don't know.\n\n246\n00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.000\nI haven't been around long enough\nto know how old the world is.\n\n247\n00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.570\nI have my views, but the point I'm\nmaking is that people have views because\n\n248\n00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:32.920\nthat are philosophical dispositions,\nwhat they believe.\n\n249\n00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.960\nAnd you're never going to\nchange somebody's mind,\n\n250\n00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.730\nespecially who deals with circular logic.\n\n251\n00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.850\nSo you come up against somebody who you\ncan see, right off the bat, they're\n\n252\n00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:48.280\nas sharp as a tack, and you can see\nsomebody here that's maybe not as smart.\n\n253\n00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.000\nYou'll try to make-\n>> Who's your mark?\n\n254\n00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.111\n>> Yeah, you're gonna try your mark.\n\n255\n00:15:52.111 --> 00:15:57.077\nI think they say in the field that,\nif you're in a poker game,\n\n256\n00:15:57.077 --> 00:15:59.941\nand you have figured out, really,\n\n257\n00:15:59.941 --> 00:16:05.018\nwho the mark is within a few minutes,\nokay, you're the mark.\n\n258\n00:16:05.018 --> 00:16:05.528\n>> You're it.\n\n259\n00:16:05.528 --> 00:16:07.671\n>> Yeah, you're it.\n\n260\n00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:10.585\nSo it's something to be said.\n\n261\n00:16:10.585 --> 00:16:15.483\nCertainly there are safe guards and\nwe talked about scraping\n\n262\n00:16:15.483 --> 00:16:20.150\nemail addresses so\non how to use obfuscation for it.\n\n263\n00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:26.070\nCertain training is an important part,\nbut things that really can inhibit your\n\n264\n00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.860\nability to extract\ninformation is how educated\n\n265\n00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.730\nare the The subjects\nthat you're going after.\n\n266\n00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:38.850\nHow smart are they?\n\n267\n00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.990\nYou're obviously going to\nneed to be smarter than that.\n\n268\n00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.380\nThe awareness of the types\nof information sought after.\n\n269\n00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:54.600\nBeing able to break down the different\ncomponents of email systems,\n\n270\n00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.240\ntelephone systems.\n\n271\n00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.940\nYou need a deep understanding\nof how voice over IP works.\n\n272\n00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:07.710\nOf how cellular phone systems work.\n\n273\n00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:10.140\nYou've got very guarded information.\n\n274\n00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.190\nIt's important to really understand.\n\n275\n00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.060\n>> Well, cuz that's gonna help\nyou speak with authority.\n\n276\n00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.820\nI always think of the, I love the movie\nHackers and it was, I know, as cheesy and\n\n277\n00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.260\nas bad as it was.\n\n278\n00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.650\nIt definitely was spark in a young\nman's life who got him into IT.\n\n279\n00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:29.580\nIt did did that for me.\n\n280\n00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:36.270\nAnd there was a scene in the movie,\nwhere he calls up a TV station, right?\n\n281\n00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:40.480\nJust a local television affiliate and\nsays, I work for\n\n282\n00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.150\nthe company, I'm trying to dial in so\nI can get some spreadsheets.\n\n283\n00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:49.110\nCan you tell me the number\nof the modem on the desk?\n\n284\n00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.452\nAnd the night guard's like [SOUND] and\n\n285\n00:17:50.452 --> 00:17:52.277\nhe's throwing all this\ntechnical jargon at him.\n\n286\n00:17:52.277 --> 00:17:54.440\nThe guy has no idea what\nhe's talking about.\n\n287\n00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.250\nHe says there's a little box with\nsome lights flashing on it and\n\n288\n00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.270\nthere should be a phone number on there.\n\n289\n00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.810\nTell me what that is.\n\n290\n00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:00.690\nAnd he does.\n\n291\n00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.100\nOkay, thank you so much Norm.\n\n292\n00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:06.610\nYou've been such a great help, hangs up,\ndials into the system and gains access.\n\n293\n00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:13.328\nThat was a perfect a picture\nof social engineering.\n\n294\n00:18:13.328 --> 00:18:16.210\n>> True.\n\n295\n00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:23.260\nSo, we really needed to know who\nbenefit for this gain of information.\n\n296\n00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.395\nTypically, your plan of attack,\n\n297\n00:18:29.395 --> 00:18:33.751\nyour agreement that you completed in\n\n298\n00:18:33.751 --> 00:18:38.668\nthe beginning of your assessment when you\n\n299\n00:18:38.668 --> 00:18:44.650\ndevelop this job should\ndirect as to who gets it.\n\n300\n00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:48.170\nYou don't, but at the same time, you need\nto protect that information as well.\n\n301\n00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.630\nBecause that information\nin the wrong hands,\n\n302\n00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.190\ncould do a lot of damage to the company.\n\n303\n00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.260\nI don't know.\nAre you the type to\n\n304\n00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.800\nsell it to the highest bidder,\nat that point.\n\n305\n00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.900\n>> So I guess that comes down to,\n\n306\n00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:04.770\nwhat should we do with our abilities as\na PEN tester, or as a social engineer?\n\n307\n00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.370\nHow should we use them for\ngood and not evil, right?\n\n308\n00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:08.720\n>> Right and at the same time,\n\n309\n00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.220\nif we can really find out\nwhat the company's policy is.\n\n310\n00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:16.960\nReally, what there policy\nis towards access control,\n\n311\n00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.820\nwhat their policies are towards\npassword resetting, for instance.\n\n312\n00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:28.460\nOn my way here,\nI left my connecting ticket in my bag.\n\n313\n00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:34.860\nAnd I also left my wallet in my bag,\nand the bag got put on the plane.\n\n314\n00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.330\nAnd went up to customer service,\nand I said, I need a ticket for\n\n315\n00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:39.220\nthe connecting flight.\n\n316\n00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.000\nAnd they said, well,\ncould I have your driver's license?\n\n317\n00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.780\nAnd I went,\nmy god my wallet was stolen, and I\n\n318\n00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:52.600\ndrove this poor woman crazy until I\ngot my ticket my connecting flight.\n\n319\n00:19:53.800 --> 00:20:00.200\nBut sometimes, I guess we need\nthis you need to do it to survive.\n\n320\n00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:08.410\nIn this case,\nwhy I brought that up was that,\n\n321\n00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:13.910\nwhat is American Airlines\npolicy towards a person\n\n322\n00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:18.072\nthat needs another ticket,\nanother boarding pass?\n\n323\n00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.200\nWhat information do they ask?\n\n324\n00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.560\nShe asked me for a phone number, but\nI got 3 or 4 phone numbers, you know?\n\n325\n00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.260\nSo when I hit her with my phone\nnumber it was the wrong phone number.\n\n326\n00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.158\nSo now it was like 2 strikes.\n\n327\n00:20:33.158 --> 00:20:34.969\nCan I have a driver's license?\n\n328\n00:20:34.969 --> 00:20:36.836\nCan I have a phone number?\n\n329\n00:20:36.836 --> 00:20:38.772\nNo, no.\n\n330\n00:20:38.772 --> 00:20:44.350\nSo I could tell though, by looking at her,\nshe was gonna give it up.\n\n331\n00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.070\nI knew she was gonna give it up, but\n\n332\n00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.010\nit's just a matter of how\nmany steps we go through.\n\n333\n00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.610\nNow, what's her policy?\n\n334\n00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:54.590\nIt would be interesting to see that\nbecause probably, you could do another\n\n335\n00:20:56.310 --> 00:21:02.249\nkinda Frank Abagnale flying the skies\nsimply by getting people's tickets.\n\n336\n00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.320\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n337\n00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:05.990\n>> Very possible.\n\n338\n00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:10.420\n>> And again,\njust by going after that innate\n\n339\n00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.858\nthing inside of us\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n340\n00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:21.513\n>> [INAUDIBLE] Blah blah blah.\n\n341\n00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:25.852\nLooks like you were in the military, yeah.\n\n342\n00:21:25.852 --> 00:21:29.160\nYeah, well, it was a problem.\n\n343\n00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:35.180\nMy last name being Optigrove,\nit's like, do I know you?\n\n344\n00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.880\nWhat's your last name?\n\n345\n00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.890\nIt's Smith?\n\n346\n00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:38.400\nWell, hey!\n\n347\n00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.910\nYou know?\nI'll go over there, and I'm like, hey!\n\n348\n00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:46.595\nIt's like Samantha, I've gotta fly\nsomewhere, and I can't find my ticket.\n\n349\n00:21:46.595 --> 00:21:50.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It wouldn't been certainly possible\n\n350\n00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:51.360\nto do that.\n\n351\n00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.705\nAs we walk through a list of we're\ngonna see those kind of elements,\n\n352\n00:21:56.705 --> 00:21:58.475\nhow we kind of draw that out.\n\n353\n00:21:58.475 --> 00:22:02.165\nWe're gonna actually play around with\nsome little games on how to do that.\n\n354\n00:22:02.165 --> 00:22:02.855\n>> That'll be fun.\n\n355\n00:22:02.855 --> 00:22:07.279\nWhen I was a young man, I was in college,\nI worked at a drug store and\n\n356\n00:22:07.279 --> 00:22:12.265\npeople would come in, they'd buy milk and\nthey'd buy eggs, you name it.\n\n357\n00:22:12.265 --> 00:22:15.795\nAnd I would every now and\nthen have someone come up and\n\n358\n00:22:15.795 --> 00:22:19.080\nsay I want to return this, and\nthey didn't have a receipt.\n\n359\n00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.840\nStore policy was you have to\nhave a receipt for returns.\n\n360\n00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.310\nAnd I would get cussed up one wall and\ndown another,\n\n361\n00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.840\ncalled everything but my name.\n\n362\n00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.160\nAnd I would say I'm sorry,\nthe company policy is that you must have\n\n363\n00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.020\na receipt that proves that you bought that\nat our store so that we can return it.\n\n364\n00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.580\nWell of course, they yelled enough and\n\n365\n00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:43.510\na manager comes along and\nsays just give them a return.\n\n366\n00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:46.500\nAnd then they do that some more and\nthen a couple of months down the road\n\n367\n00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.600\nthey're saying we can't do\nreturns like that anymore,\n\n368\n00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.160\nbecause we had some people\nreturning things for\n\n369\n00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.650\nhigher prices than what they bought them\nfor and stealing money from the company.\n\n370\n00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.020\nAnd I'm like, well there you go.\n\n371\n00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.090\nDon't say I told you so,\nbut I told you so.\n\n372\n00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.340\n>> Right.\n>> And no one wants to listen.\n\n373\n00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:03.370\n>> Well because nobody wants\nto deal with an angry person.\n\n374\n00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:04.000\n>> Right.\n\n375\n00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.750\n>> That's actually one of the ploys\nthat you're going to do that.\n\n376\n00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:13.000\nYou may not do it to\nthe person in front of you,\n\n377\n00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.920\nbut you may pick your phone and\ngo, you are suppose to meet me,\n\n378\n00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.810\nnow I'm gonna be late, has got\neverything mess up, start screaming.\n\n379\n00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:27.230\nThat could set up a little\nattitude towards the person that\n\n380\n00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.810\nyou're dealing with.\n\n381\n00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.950\nYou walk over to them,\nthey're gonna be a little less\n\n382\n00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:33.500\ncuz they don't wanna really get\nin your face at that point.\n\n383\n00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:38.160\nAnd so I've seen it done, and I've\ncertainly been on the other end of it.\n\n384\n00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.380\nI was just curious,\n\n385\n00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:45.110\nwhat are the things have you come across\nwhen people are returning things?\n\n386\n00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.928\n>> That?\n\n387\n00:23:45.928 --> 00:23:47.280\n>> Ploys.\n\n388\n00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.020\n>> Ploys?\n\n389\n00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:50.940\n>> My mother's in the hospital, you know?\n\n390\n00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.430\nMy wife's having a baby.\n\n391\n00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:53.530\nI gotta get back.\n\n392\n00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:54.750\nI ain't got time, you know?\n\n393\n00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.108\n>> Yeah, I've definitely seen sob stories.\n\n394\n00:23:57.108 --> 00:24:01.925\nI remember one specifically, where a lady,\nthere was a company that worked\n\n395\n00:24:01.925 --> 00:24:05.929\nwith a company that I was a part of and\nthey did computer repair.\n\n396\n00:24:05.929 --> 00:24:07.830\nAnd she wanted her laptop back.\n\n397\n00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:12.609\nAnd they said, well, the person that works\nthat department is on vacation right now,\n\n398\n00:24:12.609 --> 00:24:15.840\nI can go into the room and\nsee if your laptop is there.\n\n399\n00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.230\nSo they do, they find that it is,\nis completely taken apart and\n\n400\n00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.110\nthey haven't paid their bill.\n\n401\n00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.500\nRight?\nAnd that was, and she said, well,\n\n402\n00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.200\nI want my laptop back.\n\n403\n00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:29.180\nAnd they said, well, you haven't paid\nthe bill for the services rendered and\n\n404\n00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:33.690\nI can't get a hold of the person, and she\nsaid, I got to be here, I got to be there.\n\n405\n00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.370\nThey made every concession,\nI said, you know what?\n\n406\n00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.530\nWe'll work on it, we'll fix it,\nyou can pay the bill, and\n\n407\n00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:42.790\nwe'll overnight it to where you're going\nto be so that way you won't be late.\n\n408\n00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:45.030\nNo, no, no, I need it now.\n\n409\n00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.520\nRight, and that's when you're like okay.\n\n410\n00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.780\nNow, I know what's going on,\nI see what you're doing.\n\n411\n00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.429\nYou're trying to\nmanipulate me emotionally.\n\n412\n00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:56.730\nAnd maybe even through threats,\nthings which she did do,\n\n413\n00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.480\ncall you everything under the sun-\n>> Crying-\n\n414\n00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.900\n>> Everything, yeah.\n\n415\n00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.920\n>> Insults, so\nthe funny thing about that is that\n\n416\n00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.700\nthere's a difference between\naggression and assertiveness.\n\n417\n00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.420\nAn aggressive person,\nusually people will escalate.\n\n418\n00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:13.910\nThey'll start to scream.\n\n419\n00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:18.500\nThey'll get louder,\nmake threatening gestures to\n\n420\n00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:25.950\nget the refund, whereas I think\nif you just simply be assertive.\n\n421\n00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.170\nYou know what the end line is,\nwhat you want.\n\n422\n00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:33.320\nSay, I realize your company policy\nis such that you don't give refunds,\n\n423\n00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.180\nbut I really want to get a refund.\n\n424\n00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.420\nThis product was defective.\n\n425\n00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.590\nYeah, I understand,\nI understand, believe me, but,\n\n426\n00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:46.650\nI really need to get a refund.\n\n427\n00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:53.310\nAnd assert yourself, simply stick to the\npoint, and in most cases you'll get it.\n\n428\n00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:56.310\nWell, obviously you can't get the refund.\n\n429\n00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.899\nWell, who's the manager?\n\n430\n00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.930\nSo they all have to kind\nof move up the chain.\n\n431\n00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.330\n>> You continue to make it.\n\n432\n00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:05.090\nI always like to say, well, obviously,\nyou're not the person to talk to.\n\n433\n00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:06.230\nLet me talk to your manager.\n\n434\n00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:10.600\nAnd then you start giving them the reasons\nbecause it's what it seems to boil down to\n\n435\n00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.590\na lot of times is people just need a good\nreason to do what it is you want to do,\n\n436\n00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:16.280\neven though it's against policy.\n\n437\n00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:21.130\n>> At this point, as long as you give\nreasons they've shown that 60% to\n\n438\n00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:26.450\n70% of people will let somebody\nget in front of them in line if\n\n439\n00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:30.240\nthey have a reason, say, you mind if I get\nin front of you because I'm in a hurry?\n\n440\n00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.763\n>> And that's a sufficient reason?\n\n441\n00:26:32.763 --> 00:26:35.030\n[LAUGH]\n>> Six out of ten people will go, yeah,\n\n442\n00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.605\nthat's a sufficient reason.\n\n443\n00:26:36.605 --> 00:26:38.130\nThat's free.\n\n444\n00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:42.994\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> But it just goes to show if\n\n445\n00:26:42.994 --> 00:26:45.970\nyou assert yourself,\n>> Right.\n\n446\n00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:50.370\n>> You are more apt to accomplish\nyour goal than not, and\n\n447\n00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:53.260\nthat's simply one of the reasons\nsocial engineering works so\n\n448\n00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.790\nwell because we all,\nin a way, we want to help.\n\n449\n00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:58.800\nMaybe most people don't\nknow how to deal with that.\n\n450\n00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.820\n>> Interestingly enough,\n\n451\n00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:05.350\nI've gotten money off of retail prices by\njust asking is that price set in stone?\n\n452\n00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:07.550\nCan I have it for less money?\n\n453\n00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:09.500\nOtherwise I'm going to walk\nout of here without buying it.\n\n454\n00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.290\n>> Right, right.\n\n455\n00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:13.440\n>> And sometimes the answer is yeah,\nI'll drop a couple bucks off there.\n\n456\n00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.140\n>> Yeah, we've all dealt with\nHonest Bob the car salesman.\n\n457\n00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.870\nAnd, come on, Bob.\n\n458\n00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.690\nWe got a better price than his or\nI'm walking.\n\n459\n00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.690\nWait a minute, you know.\n\n460\n00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:23.960\n>> Hold on.\n\n461\n00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.230\nLet me re-crunch those numbers.\n\n462\n00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:30.900\n>> And then Bob actually adds\nthe undercoding and the bells and\n\n463\n00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:36.060\nwhistles\n>> And now you just paid, 5% more for it.\n\n464\n00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.360\nOnly because you fell.\n\n465\n00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.610\n>> And he's over there going,\nyou got me man.\n\n466\n00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.110\nMan, you really know what you're doing.\n\n467\n00:27:44.110 -->

This is done through techniques like questioning/questionnaire and communication tactics like rapport building and context matching. They also discuss the goals of elicitation which is answering the Big5 questions (who/what/when/where/why). Also covered are guidelines to follow and possible mistakes to be avoided.",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:17.700\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry,\n\n4\n00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.780\nand in today's episode we are continuing\non with our social engineering series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.200\nHopefully you guys are enjoying that.\n\n6\n00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.970\nI know I sure am, and\njoining us, back in the studio,\n\n7\n00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.130\nto give us a little more enjoyment is\nour good friend, Mr. Tom Updegrove.\n\n8\n00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.300\nTom, welcome back, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.990\nWe're so glad to have you back\n>> You got the name down.\n\n10\n00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.860\n>> At this point.\n\n11\n00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.510\nThat's good.\n\n12\n00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.604\n>> Like a pro.\n>> [LAUGH] Like a pro.\n\n13\n00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:38.170\n>> [LAUGH] Well, that being said,\nwhat are we doing today, Mr. Tom?\n\n14\n00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.080\nHow's it gonna work today?\n\n15\n00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.150\n>> Well,\ntoday we're gonna talk about elicitation.\n\n16\n00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.280\nAnd licitation basically is\nhow you draw information from\n\n17\n00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.080\npeople without their realizing\nyou're drawing the information.\n\n18\n00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.890\nA naturally if somebody\nsenses you're going for\n\n19\n00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.560\ntheir bigger secrets\nthey're gonna climb up.\n\n20\n00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.950\nAnd so, how do we do that?\n\n21\n00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.949\nWhat are the aspects of it?\n\n22\n00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.150\nOne aspect of elicitation is\n\n23\n00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.620\nthey're saying that you're born\nwith two ears and one mouth.\n\n24\n00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.620\nSo elicitation isn't always talking\nover a person, it's listening.\n\n25\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.946\nBigger part of it is listening and\nlearning to rephrase your conversation and\n\n26\n00:01:28.946 --> 00:01:33.537\nredirect the conversation\ntowards the areas you want.\n\n27\n00:01:36.682 --> 00:01:39.940\nWhich brings a little bit\ninto communication theory.\n\n28\n00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.630\nI don't think we need a whole\nlot of communication theory but\n\n29\n00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.270\nbasically communication theory is,\n\n30\n00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.700\nin fact if we could throw up this\ngraphic I have on my laptop.\n\n31\n00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.270\nAll right, so first off,\nthere's the message, right?\n\n32\n00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.710\nSo the message has to be transmitted\nin some way in this case,\n\n33\n00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.640\nI'm transmitting my message via voice.\n\n34\n00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.840\nThat would be the mode, but\n\n35\n00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.050\nI could be transmitting that\nmessage over a telephone, right?\n\n36\n00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.710\nAnd I could be recording a message,\n\n37\n00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.010\nsending it over wi-fi, the various modes.\n\n38\n00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.780\nCertainly there's a reception of that.\n\n39\n00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.730\nIn your case it's going to be yours\nthat's going to pick it up but\n\n40\n00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.210\nif I were using a radio system I\nwould have a transmitter at one end\n\n41\n00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.640\ntransmitting over the ether\nto your receiver, right?\n\n42\n00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.170\nWhat's the response in that?\n\n43\n00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.320\nWhen I ask you a question\nwhat's the reply?\n\n44\n00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.640\nAnd that whole thing, that whole concept,\n\n45\n00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.850\nthat medium,\nthere's a state involved is it consistent?\n\n46\n00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.130\nFor instance in computers when I send\na syn, I should get a syn in back,\n\n47\n00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.820\nsyn ack back right, and\nthen I should be able to ack that.\n\n48\n00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.150\nIf I don't,\nthen I am gonna get retransmission,\n\n49\n00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.700\nso I get that, we understand that it's\n\n50\n00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.610\nthe same communication medium\nthat we are talking about.\n\n51\n00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.420\nSo having some understanding of that the\ninteresting thing from the transmission\n\n52\n00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.300\npoint of view to the reception point of\nview there are some factors involved.\n\n53\n00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.000\nFor instance if we had\nmore distance between us,\n\n54\n00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.810\nfurther apart we could probably get\nmight be some white noise in the way.\n\n55\n00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.310\nYou mean I pick it all up, okay, and\nthen I never know in terms of what I said.\n\n56\n00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.780\nAnd you received it perfectly\nwhat you perception of that was.\n\n57\n00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.930\nDid you understand that idea?\n\n58\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.190\nWell, there was a term that I I said\n\n59\n00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.090\nyou'll mean something to\nyou something different.\n\n60\n00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.520\nSo I think from that extent it's\nimportant that we kinda look at\n\n61\n00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.605\nthe vehicle that we use, and the fact the\nthe message doesn't always get through.\n\n62\n00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:03.685\nWe need means to check it and\nto understand\n\n63\n00:04:05.565 --> 00:04:13.075\nthe feedback that we get from our message\nand which is an important part of it all.\n\n64\n00:04:13.075 --> 00:04:17.485\nSo there's an idea, the transmission,\nthe media and the resistance to it.\n\n65\n00:04:17.485 --> 00:04:23.090\nFor instance when I transmit something\nover a wire, I'm gonna get impedance.\n\n66\n00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.510\nIf I'm transmitting ethernet,\nI get over 300 feet,\n\n67\n00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.700\nI'm gonna get to much repeating so\nI'm not gonna get anything at all.\n\n68\n00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.170\nI need some way to amplify that and\nboost that.\n\n69\n00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.027\nPerception is some thing\nwe're gonna try to deal\n\n70\n00:04:43.027 --> 00:04:48.002\nwith as we kinda move along\nwith our are thinking,\n\n71\n00:04:48.002 --> 00:04:52.640\ncertainly, adaptation within that system.\n\n72\n00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.250\nIf I express this idea but\nyou do not understand.\n\n73\n00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.750\nI don't quite get that.\n\n74\n00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.440\nI need to adapt my message, or\nI may need to change the mode.\n\n75\n00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.710\nI mean to do it in a different way.\n\n76\n00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.510\nWe need to match context, and so\nthe context in the message is important.\n\n77\n00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:21.310\nFor instance, if I show up to\na bank meeting in overalls.\n\n78\n00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.120\nI mean, the package is always\nwhat things are wrapped up to be,\n\n79\n00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.263\nthings should be in a contextual way.\n\n80\n00:05:29.263 --> 00:05:34.540\nThe place that I\n\n81\n00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.620\nam going into for\na social engineering exploit, I should\n\n82\n00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.580\nbe expected, or I should be able\nto fit in to that environment.\n\n83\n00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.860\nAnd if I'm dealing in an area where\ntypically, it's business suit attire.\n\n84\n00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.950\nI should be in a business suit attire.\n\n85\n00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.310\n>> So this is a good idea as, I mean,\nlook at it from a maybe a pen tester or\n\n86\n00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.860\nsocial engineering standpoint.\n\n87\n00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.970\nThat if I'm looking to infiltrate\ninto a system of some kind,\n\n88\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.610\nthen it probably would behoove me\nto try to fit into that system so\n\n89\n00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.330\nthat I am contextually blending in.\n\n90\n00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.150\n>> Blending in.\n>> Right.\n\n91\n00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.610\nIf I show up in a farmer's\noutfit to a bank meeting,\n\n92\n00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.640\nthey're gonna go, farmer Bob here,\nI don't know what he's doing here.\n\n93\n00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.760\nWe don't\n>> Right.\n\n94\n00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.030\n>> have any kind of farming\n>> Right.\n\n95\n00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.910\n>> information to talk about.\"\n>> True,\n\n96\n00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.850\nyou know though,\n>> I know some salesmen that will\n\n97\n00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.190\noverside that completely.\n\n98\n00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:35.220\nAnd go, you know, the farmer pulls out\na big bankroll anyway so fair idea.\n\n99\n00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.145\nBut basically we do want to\nbe contextually adaptive and\n\n100\n00:06:40.145 --> 00:06:44.438\nbe able to blend into\nwhatever it is we are doing,\n\n101\n00:06:44.438 --> 00:06:48.025\nthen for instance conversation style.\n\n102\n00:06:50.688 --> 00:06:55.510\nDoes your language fit the purpose?\n\n103\n00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.730\nDo you adapt it?\n\n104\n00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:04.669\nShould you be talking in a stronger\nfashion or should it be a little softer?\n\n105\n00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:10.880\nSo you need to really play\nwith you volume and tone, and\n\n106\n00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.195\nrhythm to your voice, bery important.\n\n107\n00:07:15.195 --> 00:07:17.200\nSpace, okay.\n\n108\n00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.420\nSometimes when you're in somebody's face,\nbut\n\n109\n00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.290\nit depends,\nculturally space is an important thing.\n\n110\n00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.930\n>> Right,\nyou have to gage that based on context.\n\n111\n00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.420\n>> Yeah, you have to gage that depending,\nreally, on the context.\n\n112\n00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.379\nSome people will really be in your face.\n\n113\n00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.620\nFor reasons other than social context,\n\n114\n00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.670\nbut we need to be able to\nblend those elements together.\n\n115\n00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.610\n>> I believe they call that\na close talker, right?\n\n116\n00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:44.181\nWhen they just naturally invade most\npeople have an idea of an aura around them\n\n117\n00:07:44.181 --> 00:07:50.365\nof personal space, and then when someone\ninvades that space it gets uncomfortable.\n\n118\n00:07:50.365 --> 00:07:54.775\nAnd so we can use that because we\nunderstand that most people work that way,\n\n119\n00:07:54.775 --> 00:07:56.525\nt hat that's how they react.\n\n120\n00:07:56.525 --> 00:08:01.227\nWe could use that to gain information\nif that's Say we drop that\n\n121\n00:08:01.227 --> 00:08:03.560\ncommunication theory.\n\n122\n00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.250\nYeah, so but that's an important one and\nit may be cultural.\n\n123\n00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.050\nPeople in the Middle East tend to\n\n124\n00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.570\ntalk closer together than\nwe do here in the West, so.\n\n125\n00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:21.960\nThat you really need to kinda do a little\nbackground study of what the special\n\n126\n00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:28.000\nrelationship is with the population\nyou're dealing with.\n\n127\n00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.799\nThen there's what we call\nthe narcissistic conversation.\n\n128\n00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.060\nAnd so\nyou're not gonna be a great pen tester if\n\n129\n00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.040\nyou are always talking\nabout how great you are.\n\n130\n00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:51.240\nAnd what you can do and the fantastic\nthings that are going on in your life.\n\n131\n00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:58.660\nYou really need to get\nyour subject talking.\n\n132\n00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.910\nSo there are a couple different\nsteps in the conversation,\n\n133\n00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:08.960\nhow the conversation is reinforced, do\n\n134\n00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.190\nyour subject actually makes the statement,\nI mean is it something that\n\n135\n00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.990\nyou follow through with or\ndo you object to it?\n\n136\n00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:25.420\nSometimes it's helpful, so certainly\n\n137\n00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:33.770\nthe elements of the shift response and\nthe support response are real important.\n\n138\n00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:42.250\nAn example might be, say, who is your\nfavorite Football team down here?\n\n139\n00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:47.210\nYou a Gator Fan or are you like\na I'm probably the worst person to\n\n140\n00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:52.480\nask this question to because I don't\nwatch football at all in any way.\n\n141\n00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.100\n>> Me either.\n\n142\n00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:53.770\nI can't.\n\n143\n00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:54.313\nI hate it.\n\n144\n00:09:54.313 --> 00:10:00.987\nI hate football, never watch it in fact.\n\n145\n00:10:00.987 --> 00:10:04.590\nBut music, is that your thing?\n\n146\n00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:05.380\n>> Yeah, I like music.\n\n147\n00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.850\nYeah, who doesn't like music right?\n\n148\n00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.310\nI like Bach music.\n\n149\n00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.880\n>> No, I hate it.\n\n150\n00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.090\nI can't stand it.\n\n151\n00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.060\nIt like, drives me crazy.\n\n152\n00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:18.000\nSo, in hence, both examples,\none would be a supportive\n\n153\n00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.220\nconnector where the other would be\nmore of an objective connector.\n\n154\n00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:28.530\nYou're probably going to get more flies\n\n155\n00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:33.660\nwith honey than you would with vinegar,\nin that sense.\n\n156\n00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:34.920\n>> Yeah.\n\n157\n00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.430\n>> So the case would be if you\nwere listening and trying to draw\n\n158\n00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:43.000\ninformation with somebody, kind of\nreally follow that conversation along.\n\n159\n00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.769\nYou gotta be supportive\nin a way that they're\n\n160\n00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.470\nfollowing back with answering\nthe questions that you're after.\n\n161\n00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.610\n>> Right,\nbecause using something like you said.\n\n162\n00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.250\nGetting more flies with honey\nthan you do with vinegar.\n\n163\n00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:58.090\nSometimes vinegar is a proper approach\nthough, because I've noticed this will\n\n164\n00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:02.220\nhappen if I disagree with someone,\nthey're more than happy to engage in\n\n165\n00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.380\nwhy I'm wrong that I disagree with\nthem and I'm getting them to talk.\n\n166\n00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.610\nI'm getting them to start saying\nthings that might be good information,\n\n167\n00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:10.270\ndifferent way.\n\n168\n00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.260\n>> Right.\nWhich is an another technique.\n\n169\n00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.120\n>> Right.\n>> Certainly another technique to use,\n\n170\n00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.780\nand you're part of the concept.\n\n171\n00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:25.220\nSometimes what we do to\ngather information is,\n\n172\n00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:30.698\nwe will use surveys, questionnaires.\n\n173\n00:11:32.937 --> 00:11:37.487\nWays of drawing likes and\ndislikes from people simply,\n\n174\n00:11:41.858 --> 00:11:47.491\nKind of like preloading ourselves to\nfind a little more about their person.\n\n175\n00:11:47.491 --> 00:11:50.730\nSo we can enter into a conversation\nwith them a lot easier.\n\n176\n00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:58.170\nCertainly, in the conversation,\nwe go back to the six big ones.\n\n177\n00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.460\nWho?\n\n178\n00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.100\nWhat?\n\n179\n00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:00.720\nWhere?\n\n180\n00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.530\nWhen?\n\n181\n00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.090\nHow?\nWhy?\n\n182\n00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.113\nYou could keep a conversation\ngoing all day, just-\n\n183\n00:12:05.113 --> 00:12:06.212\n>> Using six words.\n\n184\n00:12:06.212 --> 00:12:08.580\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah with those six words.\n\n185\n00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:14.453\nAnd remember it's really not about you its\nreally about the person you talking too.\n\n186\n00:12:14.453 --> 00:12:21.849\nWhat are they like,\nwhat are they after, what do you after?\n\n187\n00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:30.970\nSo with that in mind,\nI think there are some elements that we'd\n\n188\n00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:36.460\nlike to work with when we're dealing with\na person, one of which is naturalness.\n\n189\n00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:43.758\nNaturalness should be you\ndon't wanna be too uptight\n\n190\n00:12:43.758 --> 00:12:49.030\nstanding there Have\na grimace on your face.\n\n191\n00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.300\nYou've gotta try to blend in.\n\n192\n00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:56.050\nTry to, even breathing is\nan important part of naturalist.\n\n193\n00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:00.520\nSo I say that to understand\nnaturalist more,\n\n194\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:08.627\nit would be helpful to get involved in\nsome physical exercise, practice yoga,\n\n195\n00:13:08.627 --> 00:13:14.485\nsomething like tai-chi to help you\nto learn your breathing patterns,\n\n196\n00:13:14.485 --> 00:13:18.770\nsnd how to control them and\nblend them in with somebody.\n\n197\n00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.990\nLearn to understand your breathing and\nunderstand your own physical movements,\n\n198\n00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:25.760\nyour own naturalness, your own behavior.\n\n199\n00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.200\nEven having yourself on camera is a great\nway to get a little feedback and-\n\n200\n00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.681\n>> Helps you become more self-aware or\n\n201\n00:13:31.681 --> 00:13:32.646\nself-aware, right.\n\n202\n00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:37.510\nSo, self-awareness again that\nare whole endeavor here is awareness.\n\n203\n00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.960\n>> Right.\n\n204\n00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.460\n>> Certain need elicitation.\n\n205\n00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.170\nYou're naturalist is gonna\nbe an important part.\n\n206\n00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:47.170\n>> No, it's that because if we\ncome off as maybe robotic or\n\n207\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.650\nas you said maybe confrontational\nwith our body language, or\n\n208\n00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:53.800\nsomething that the person that we're\ntrying to elicit a response from now.\n\n209\n00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.570\nMaybe that might be the response\nwe want them to feel combative, or\n\n210\n00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:02.950\nconfrontational or defensive,\nbut typically we want to engender\n\n211\n00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.550\ngood will between us so\nthat they will open up to us, correct?\n\n212\n00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:11.560\nAnd that's why we don't engage in\na contextual type of unnaturalness.\n\n213\n00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.060\n>> Yes.\n\n214\n00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.340\nGiven the situation.\n\n215\n00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.110\n>> Right.\nGiven the situation.\n\n216\n00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:25.000\n>> The situation, maybe you need to\nexpress posture of intimidation,\n\n217\n00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.510\nit might get you out of a jam\n>> Right\n\n218\n00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.270\n>> You need to be informed.\n\n219\n00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.790\nYou need to be knowledgable.\n\n220\n00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:44.660\nIf you're going into a say\na medical conference,\n\n221\n00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:49.400\nyou should understand some of the terms,\nat least what that conference is about.\n\n222\n00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:54.070\nYou may have your subjects may\nactually be participants in there\n\n223\n00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:58.240\nthat's basically going to be your base\npoint for drawing information from that,\n\n224\n00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.420\nyou gotta prepare yourself.\n\n225\n00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.250\nYou need to read up on the latest medical\n\n226\n00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:09.210\nthings that I have It's a dental\nconvention to understand it.\n\n227\n00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:11.760\nIf it's a political convention,\nreally understand.\n\n228\n00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:19.780\nif it's a sports convention, understand\nthat, and know your sports trivia.\n\n229\n00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.960\n>> Yeah that will help.\n\n230\n00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:26.840\n>> Yeah, well\n>> At least lends to make you appear to be\n\n231\n00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.830\nsomebody who blends into the situation,\nyou should be there.\n\n232\n00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.900\n>> You're not the sore thumb\nin the group of people and\n\n233\n00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.180\nthem going who is this guy who\nknows nothing about the business.\n\n234\n00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.990\nHe's dressing strangely and his posture\nis very robotic and defensive, and\n\n235\n00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:44.948\nthere's nothing about this, what we do\nhere you gonna kind of draw attention to\n\n236\n00:15:44.948 --> 00:15:48.502\nyourself not really for\nthe most probably what you want.\n\n237\n00:15:48.502 --> 00:15:52.166\nYou want people to accept you in and\nsay yah I like Tom,\n\n238\n00:15:52.166 --> 00:15:55.341\nman Tom has all the same\nkind of interest i do and\n\n239\n00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:59.595\neven when he doesn't he still\ntalks intelligently about it.\n\n240\n00:15:59.595 --> 00:16:00.892\nAnd he's a personable guy.\n\n241\n00:16:00.892 --> 00:16:02.466\nI like what he has to say.\n\n242\n00:16:02.466 --> 00:16:06.017\nAnd I'm gonna have conversation with him,\nbecause I like him.\n\n243\n00:16:06.017 --> 00:16:07.220\nYou're basically like what\nwe talked about before.\n\n244\n00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:11.128\nYou're selling yourself to the context.\n\n245\n00:16:11.128 --> 00:16:12.868\n>> Exactly.\n\n246\n00:16:12.868 --> 00:16:15.950\nBut you have to be realistic about it.\n\n247\n00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:16.760\n>> Right.\n>> Okay so,\n\n248\n00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.070\nif you're not realistic about it.\n\n249\n00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:22.436\nFor instance, you're gonna start\ntalking about quantum physics and\n\n250\n00:16:22.436 --> 00:16:23.554\nyou have no idea.\n\n251\n00:16:23.554 --> 00:16:27.770\nYou're gonna come off,\nyou're going to typecast yourself and\n\n252\n00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:31.090\nreally ostracize yourself from the group.\n\n253\n00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:31.950\n>> Right.\n\n254\n00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:36.370\n>> Other ways around it, still, because\nyou can still be an inquisitive person.\n\n255\n00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.160\nSay, well, tell me about quantum physics.\n\n256\n00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.780\nWhat do you know about it?\n\n257\n00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.920\n>> Yeah.\n>> I find it fascinating, but\n\n258\n00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.500\nit seems like you know\nmore about it than I do.\n\n259\n00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.610\n>> Right.\n\n260\n00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.870\n>> So,\nbasically that moves it into placate.\n\n261\n00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:52.630\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n262\n00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:53.630\n>> Pump them up.\n\n263\n00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.220\nMake that person feel good.\n\n264\n00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:55.780\n>> That's right.\n\n265\n00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:56.627\n>> Get him talking.\n\n266\n00:16:56.627 --> 00:16:57.210\n>> Stroke him.\n\n267\n00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:58.135\n>> Exactly, stroke him.\n\n268\n00:16:58.135 --> 00:17:00.024\nI'm okay, you're okay and\n\n269\n00:17:00.024 --> 00:17:03.808\nI'll be better when I find out\nreally what I need to know.\n\n270\n00:17:03.808 --> 00:17:05.680\n>> Yeah.\n\n271\n00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.300\n>> It helps a lot.\n\n272\n00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.200\nThe technique,\neverybody's a little different and\n\n273\n00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.655\nI think that you really need\nto be flexible with it.\n\n274\n00:17:12.655 --> 00:17:18.670\nAnd you're throwing out your thought and\nidea.\n\n275\n00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.820\nYou're getting back some information\nsaying that person's really not\n\n276\n00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.810\nreally receptive to that\nwhole sports thing.\n\n277\n00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.640\nAnd I gotta find really\nwhere their interests are.\n\n278\n00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.340\n>> Yeah.\n\n279\n00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.920\nMan, I just hit a great concert last week.\n\n280\n00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.808\nReally the weather.\n\n281\n00:17:35.808 --> 00:17:41.414\nWell, Pink Floyd,\nwell Pink Floyd look alike.\n\n282\n00:17:41.414 --> 00:17:44.460\n>> Yeah.\n\n283\n00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:49.042\n>> Very important that you\ncan do kinda do that and\n\n284\n00:17:49.042 --> 00:17:53.090\ncertainly the one you picked out.\n\n285\n00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:57.830\nDraw your subject out by making a mistake.\n\n286\n00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.480\nPink Floyd?\n\n287\n00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.220\nMan it's like, boy I love their music.\n\n288\n00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.050\nIt's amazing how that music\nactually stayed around so long.\n\n289\n00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.410\nBut with a mistake.\n\n290\n00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:16.114\nWhen making a mistake,\nyou will have somebody butt in and\n\n291\n00:18:16.114 --> 00:18:21.270\nsay but I think I seen people\nare even doing better with that.\n\n292\n00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:28.120\nAnd you can somewhat draw out a person\nthat may have been a little tired.\n\n293\n00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:33.010\nTalk and sick, because they want to\nimpress you with what they know.\n\n294\n00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:37.300\nIdeally, that's the best way\nto get somebody talking.\n\n295\n00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.700\n>> Yeah, find something that\nthey're extremely interested in or\n\n296\n00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:41.480\npassionate about.\n\n297\n00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.032\n>> Or extremely knowledgeable about and\nthen let them expound on it and\n\n298\n00:18:44.032 --> 00:18:45.118\nthey just kind of direct it.\n\n299\n00:18:45.118 --> 00:18:48.210\n>> Hopefully they're the narcissistic\nconversationalist, right?\n\n300\n00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:48.892\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n301\n00:18:48.892 --> 00:18:51.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right and you support that, okay?\n\n302\n00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:57.639\nOf course, there's always\nthe assumed knowledge aspect of it.\n\n303\n00:18:57.639 --> 00:19:01.975\nThat if it looks like a duck and\n\n304\n00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:07.578\nquacks like a duck, it must be a duck.\n\n305\n00:19:07.578 --> 00:19:14.500\nIf it looks like a social engineer,\nprobably is a social engineer.\n\n306\n00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.390\n>> Yeah, I had a guy come up to\nme at a gas station one time.\n\n307\n00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.270\nI had just pulled up, I'm getting gas.\n\n308\n00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:23.940\nHe walks up to me and says, hey and\nI'm thinking, here we go, right?\n\n309\n00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:29.230\nHere we go and he starts telling me about\nhow he's taken this girl out on a date and\n\n310\n00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.300\nall he has is this gas card.\n\n311\n00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:36.670\nAnd he wants to use cash\nto kind of impress her and\n\n312\n00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:40.021\nhe'll pay for my gas with his gas card\nif I go to the ATM and get him cash.\n\n313\n00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:46.690\nAnd from hey, I was like this,\nthere is something wrong here brother.\n\n314\n00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.410\n>> Right, right.\n\n315\n00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:52.800\nProbably not quite assumed now,\nor a assumed position.\n\n316\n00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:57.623\nBut should you be standing in\nthe gas station when you have $20,\n\n317\n00:19:57.623 --> 00:19:59.700\n$20 and say, all right.\n\n318\n00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.760\nHe takes it from you.\n\n319\n00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.331\nYou assume, if he's standing behind\nthe counter, you know what I mean?\n\n320\n00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:07.746\nThat he was the guy that's\ngoing to dispense gas to you.\n\n321\n00:20:07.746 --> 00:20:10.670\n>> No, he was a random dude.\n\n322\n00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.760\nHe was wearing street clothes.\n\n323\n00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.920\n>> Right.\n\n324\n00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.960\nNo, in Philadelphia all the time.\n\n325\n00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.830\nSo, if he says hey,\nI'll pump the gas for you.\n\n326\n00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:21.450\nNow, it's a little different,\nbecause these people want to hear, okay.\n\n327\n00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:22.775\nLet's open the door for you,\n\n328\n00:20:22.775 --> 00:20:25.690\nbecause he's hoping you'll give\nhim some change on the way out.\n\n329\n00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.220\nSo, they're befriending you.\n\n330\n00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.860\nYou say hey,\nI really want to help you out.\n\n331\n00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.380\nJust to do a friend a favor.\n\n332\n00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.710\nSo that's really what we\ncall the gift-giving.\n\n333\n00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.390\n>> Yeah.\n\n334\n00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:39.400\n>> I give you a gift, by rights, you're\njust supposed to give me a gift back.\n\n335\n00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.510\n>> Right.\n\n336\n00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, of course, of course.\n\n337\n00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:51.469\nAnd of course, we can't really\ndispense with alcohol and drugs.\n\n338\n00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.600\nAlcohol will get people talking.\n\n339\n00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.960\n>> Loosens them up, doesn't it?\n\n340\n00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.700\n>> Alcohol will loosen some people up.\n\n341\n00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:06.110\nI once actually took\nan IRS agent to dinner and\n\n342\n00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:11.710\nbrought him drinks and\n\n343\n00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:16.760\naltered the audit from one that\ncould've been more severe to\n\n344\n00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.740\none that was like I got to pick\na couple things out of here.\n\n345\n00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.330\nSo, I'm going to hit you with these but\nI kinda befriended him.\n\n346\n00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.601\n>> Yeah.\n>> I can't believe I actually,\n\n347\n00:21:27.601 --> 00:21:32.770\ngot to take him out, but that was a great\nlittle bit of social engineering.\n\n348\n00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.573\n>> The art of the schmooze, right?\n\n349\n00:21:34.573 --> 00:21:37.220\n[LAUGH]\n>> The other reason, funny example,\n\n350\n00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.210\nwas and\nthis only happened about three weeks ago.\n\n351\n00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:45.166\nMy son says,\nhey man let's go see Civil War.\n\n352\n00:21:45.166 --> 00:21:47.060\nThere's a pre-screener going.\n\n353\n00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.630\nThen I go, cool, let's go.\n\n354\n00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.760\nOn the way there he goes,\nby the way I don't have tickets,\n\n355\n00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.195\nwe're just going to walk in.\n\n356\n00:21:53.195 --> 00:21:54.525\nAnd I go, what are you crazy?\n\n357\n00:21:54.525 --> 00:21:57.906\nThen he goes yeah, well,\nI just look ' up on the line and\n\n358\n00:21:57.906 --> 00:22:00.165\nI know where they're playing.\n\n359\n00:22:00.165 --> 00:22:04.185\nWe walk in,\nthe others take a ticket there.\n\n360\n00:22:04.185 --> 00:22:05.735\nIt's like well, right.\n\n361\n00:22:05.735 --> 00:22:08.085\nWalk in and sure enough,\nthere's a screener.\n\n362\n00:22:08.085 --> 00:22:09.310\nWe go in and sit down.\n\n363\n00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:12.860\nWe belonged there,\nthere was no reason for it.\n\n364\n00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.310\nSo I figured I'd try my\nhand at another one.\n\n365\n00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:19.580\nI picked out a screener,\nwent to it, I took my wife.\n\n366\n00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.218\nI didn't tell her.\n\n367\n00:22:20.218 --> 00:22:26.510\nScam one, somebody's coming down and\neverybody had tickets and I go, Janet!\n\n368\n00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.865\nJanet said that it was okay to go.\n\n369\n00:22:28.865 --> 00:22:33.806\nOkay, off we go.\n\n370\n00:22:33.806 --> 00:22:38.088\nSo the other funny part about that\nwas just in developing my techniques,\n\n371\n00:22:38.088 --> 00:22:41.330\nbecause these are some of\nthe things you've gotta do.\n\n372\n00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.089\nThey didn't want anybody to\ngive up their cell phone, but\n\n373\n00:22:44.089 --> 00:22:45.960\nyou had to take the cell phone in there.\n\n374\n00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.359\nYou had to give it and\nthey were gonna put it in a bag.\n\n375\n00:22:47.359 --> 00:22:52.254\nAnd I'm like, after the film I don't\nwant to have to come back up here to get\n\n376\n00:22:52.254 --> 00:22:55.370\nmy phone, I'll just put it in my pocket.\n\n377\n00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:57.450\nAs I walked in there was\na guy with a scanner.\n\n378\n00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:59.200\nI figured.\n\n379\n00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.744\nSo, you always got to be moving.\n\n380\n00:23:00.744 --> 00:23:01.830\nYou got to be thinking on your feet.\n\n381\n00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.970\nMan, what's that scanner about?\n\n382\n00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:05.950\nBut I turned this side towards him, right.\n\n383\n00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:10.960\nI put my right side out and\nhe's all, no, we're just checking.\n\n384\n00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.110\nLooking for instruments and stuff.\n\n385\n00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.750\nAll right, cool and\nI just rolled around the other way.\n\n386\n00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:20.150\nSat down and\nI didn't feel bad about it at all.\n\n387\n00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.190\n>> Yeah?\n[LAUGH]\n\n388\n00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:24.370\n>> Until, in the middle of the movie,\n\n389\n00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.510\nmy phone went off.\n\n390\n00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.161\nEveryone was all man, so\nthat was a little crazy.\n\n391\n00:23:28.161 --> 00:23:33.199\nBut these are the kind of things you\n\n392\n00:23:33.199 --> 00:23:38.584\ngot to do to develop your skill set and\n\n393\n00:23:38.584 --> 00:23:44.168\nalong with useless smart questions.\n\n394\n00:23:44.168 --> 00:23:48.631\nIn fact,\nI got dissed actually from a therapist.\n\n395\n00:23:48.631 --> 00:23:54.307\nIn kinda rolling all this together,\nI talk to a lot of people.\n\n396\n00:23:54.307 --> 00:23:59.039\nLike I told earlier I talked\nto a guy who was Interrogator.\n\n397\n00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:05.082\nBut I said what kind of\nquestion do you use.\n\n398\n00:24:05.082 --> 00:24:08.810\nHe says well we use open\nended questions first.\n\n399\n00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:11.760\nThis guy actually deals\nwith AIDS patients.\n\n400\n00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:18.320\nBut he says look I guess all\nkinds of people with issues but.\n\n401\n00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.400\nAnd I said, you can't come right out and\nask somebody something.\n\n402\n00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.130\nYou gotta kinda circle your way in.\n\n403\n00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:25.746\nSo I always start with\nan open ended question.\n\n404\n00:24:25.746 --> 00:24:29.400\nHow's your health?\n\n405\n00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:34.530\nHow have you been, have you seen a doctor,\nhave you had a physical a long time?\n\n406\n00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:36.170\nIt will kinda circle in.\n\n407\n00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:39.980\nIt's like,\nwhat were the results of the physical.\n\n408\n00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.130\nAlways testing that person to see\nhow that person's reaction is.\n\n409\n00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.687\nIf you're still playing with that,\nI'm gonna put a message out,\n\n410\n00:24:46.687 --> 00:24:47.790\nwhat's the response back.\n\n411\n00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.450\nAnd trying to find that\nperson's comfort level.\n\n412\n00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:51.020\nLooking at it.\n\n413\n00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:54.550\nWhereas a closing question is,\ndo you have AIDS?\n\n414\n00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:57.610\n>> Right.\n\n415\n00:24:57.610 --> 00:24:58.940\n>> It may clam a person right up.\n\n416\n00:24:58.940 --> 00:24:59.540\nDo you have HIV?\n\n417\n00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.399\nWhat's your sexual preferences?\n\n418\n00:25:06.216 --> 00:25:08.880\nFor some people it's a little different.\n\n419\n00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.130\nBut there are leading questions as well.\n\n420\n00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:14.434\nYou may get a person to\ndivulge information simply\n\n421\n00:25:14.434 --> 00:25:16.646\nby leading them into something.\n\n422\n00:25:21.028 --> 00:25:26.619\nHave you been to any sporting events\nlately or if you're looking for\n\n423\n00:25:26.619 --> 00:25:31.144\nsomebody that stole something,\nyou know what I mean?\n\n424\n00:25:31.144 --> 00:25:35.990\nWhat do you think of the iPhone 6?\n\n425\n00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:37.870\nWhich is what we're missing, right?\n\n426\n00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:38.920\n>> Yeah.\n\n427\n00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:43.010\n>> Have you seen anybody\nsuspiciously walking around with it?\n\n428\n00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:45.370\nI mean, so you kinda lead people on.\n\n429\n00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:50.640\nAnd generally in a court of law they\ntry to refrain from leading questions.\n\n430\n00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:55.240\nQuestions which will,\nthey're gonna have to answer outright.\n\n431\n00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.330\nIf they kinda follow with you.\n\n432\n00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:01.440\n>> And that they kinda already\nhave a pre-determined answer.\n\n433\n00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.910\n>> Yeah.\n>> That the person questioning is\n\n434\n00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:04.710\nlooking for.\n\n435\n00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.500\n>> Right.\n>> That's why they call leading because\n\n436\n00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:10.110\nI'm leading you to say X, Y, or Z\n>> Right.\n\n437\n00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:11.340\n>> In the form of this question.\n\n438\n00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.640\nAnd that can illicit a lot\nof information though.\n\n439\n00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.020\nI mean if you're in a court of law,\nyou've got a good lawyer,\n\n440\n00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.110\nhe's going to object your honor.\n\n441\n00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:20.920\nYes, sustained, that's a leading question.\n\n442\n00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.380\nBut out in the wilds as a PIN tester,\nwe can use that all day long.\n\n443\n00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.300\nIt's a very effective form.\n\n444\n00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.420\nI love the ability to be able to say\n\n445\n00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.650\nask a question in a way that I know\nthey're going to give me an answer.\n\n446\n00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:34.330\nMaybe I assume some knowledge.\n\n447\n00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:35.800\n>> Well,\nthere is something which is the next.\n\n448\n00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.680\nIs it a something type question.\n\n449\n00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.290\n>> Right.\nAnd if they think he knows this.\n\n450\n00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.700\n>> Yeah,\nare you going to the RNC this year?\n\n451\n00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:43.730\n>> Right, right.\n\n452\n00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.200\nAssumes that I am part of the RNC.\n\n453\n00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.388\n>> Yeah, yeah, sure.\n\n454\n00:26:48.388 --> 00:26:50.695\n>> Very good.\n\n455\n00:26:54.564 --> 00:27:00.483\nI think that some of the more\nimportant aspects of it, certainly,\n\n456\n00:27:00.483 --> 00:27:06.087\nI think our next section really\nkind of moves into preloading,\n\n457\n00:27:06.087 --> 00:27:11.055\nbut I don't know if we wanna\nstart on that at this point,\n\n458\n00:27:11.055 --> 00:27:14.370\nwe are 30 minutes\n>> Our clock is a little low on\n\n459\n00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:15.140\nthe timeage there.\n\n460\n00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.548\nSo I think this is a good spot for\nus to go ahead and break and\n\n461\n00:27:18.548 --> 00:27:23.591\nwe'll do a part two on elicitation, learn\ndive in a little bit deeper into mastering\n\n462\n00:27:23.591 --> 00:27:28.500\nthat as an art form, so that we can be\nbetter PIN testers and social engineers.\n\n463\n00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.250\nTom, thanks so much for\nyour time today and\n\n464\n00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.090\nyour expertise on this,\nwe're really enjoying it.\n\n465\n00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.840\n>> Yeah.\n>> We thank you guys for watching but\n\n466\n00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.850\nit looks like it's that time again.\n\n467\n00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:37.280\nWere gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n468\n00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.050\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n469\n00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:41.010\n>> And Tom Updegrove.\n\n470\n00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:43.319\n>> And we'll see you next

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:18.330\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.620\nwe continue on with our\nsocial engineering series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.330\nJoining us back in studio again today for\n\n6\n00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.770\na part on elicitation is our good\nfriend Mister Tom Updegrove.\n\n7\n00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.710\nTom, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.180\nSo glad to have you, how's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.290\n>> Great, I'm happy to be here today.\n\n10\n00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.500\nAnd to just go back through\nthe Components of elicitation,\n\n11\n00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.520\nand we got a couple little surprises.\n\n12\n00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.350\nYeah, we got a video to kinda roll\nafter we kinda review this stuff.\n\n13\n00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.180\n>> That's gonna be awesome.\n\n14\n00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.340\n>> And, so good morning.\n\n15\n00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.730\n>> Yeah, I guess a good idea would be to,\nif maybe you watched part one yesterday,\n\n16\n00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.820\nor the day before, and\n\n17\n00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.690\nnow you're into part two\n>> You get a little brief overview of what\n\n18\n00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.290\nwe're talking about,\n\n19\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.770\nelicitation is the idea of giving\nsomeone to give you information, right?\n\n20\n00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.900\nAnd how do we do that?\n\n21\n00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.400\nHow we make that happen?\n\n22\n00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.190\nWhat's the tricks of the trade of\na social engineer to get a person to\n\n23\n00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.260\ndivulge things that maybe they\nprobably shouldn't be doing.\n\n24\n00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.340\nWe looked at a couple of techniques,\nwe looked at different types of ways in\n\n25\n00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.850\nwhich you can do this and\nwe went over that in part one.\n\n26\n00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.290\nSo if you are not familiar with that,\nwatch part one and\n\n27\n00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.060\nthen jump right back hin here in part two.\n\n28\n00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.000\nIf you are up to speed then\nwe can pick it up from here.\n\n29\n00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.360\nI would like to say we do\nhave a cool little video too.\n\n30\n00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.140\nWe love to do these videos, been a lot\nof fun, to illustrate our point, right?\n\n31\n00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.579\nWe like to show you how these things tend\nto kind of work out in if you have done\n\n32\n00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.705\na great job or [CROSSTALK] Of course.\n\n33\n00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:41.391\n>> Yeah.\n\n34\n00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:43.040\nSo shall we-\n>> Yeah.\n\n35\n00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.770\n>> Watch the video?\n>> Let's roll.\n\n36\n00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.914\n>> All right.\n>> Then let's check it out.\n\n37\n00:01:47.922 --> 00:01:48.914\n>> Good day, Sir.\n\n38\n00:01:48.914 --> 00:01:53.433\nI'm filming a documentary for my\ntelevision class about security guards and\n\n39\n00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:55.370\nhow they're unsung heroes.\n\n40\n00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.160\nAnd I hope I can get your opinion.\n\n41\n00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.940\nA first question, do you like your job?\n\n42\n00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:00.960\n>> Very much Mam.\n\n43\n00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.610\n>> Are you single or married?\n\n44\n00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.870\nI'm single ma'am.\n\n45\n00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.240\n>> So you're available, hm.\n\n46\n00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.200\nCan I see your control panel?\n\n47\n00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.500\n>> Sure, follow me this way.\n\n48\n00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.270\n>> So how do you operate the cameras?\n\n49\n00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.680\n>> Well that's a great question ma'am.\n\n50\n00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.280\n>> So I see that you're licensed to carry.\n\n51\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.900\nWhat kind of gun are you issued?\n\n52\n00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.410\n>> I carry a Glock ma'am.\n\n53\n00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.630\n>> Can you get us into HR?\n\n54\n00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.750\nWe wanna ask some questions there, too.\n\n55\n00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.820\n>> Sure.\nFollow me this way.\n\n56\n00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.388\nJust gotta punch my code in.\n\n57\n00:02:31.388 --> 00:02:33.278\n>> Can I interview your supervisor?\n\n58\n00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:34.740\n>> I don't think so ma'am.\n\n59\n00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.861\n>> Come on handsome, what's his name?\n\n60\n00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:38.293\n>> Mister Jones.\n\n61\n00:02:38.293 --> 00:02:40.012\n>> Come on you can call him.\n\n62\n00:02:40.012 --> 00:02:41.292\n>> Okay.\n\n63\n00:02:41.292 --> 00:02:42.685\n>> Well I think that's all for us.\n\n64\n00:02:42.685 --> 00:02:44.829\nThank you very much it's a big help.\n\n65\n00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:45.680\n>> Good day ma'am.\n\n66\n00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.650\nAll right.\n>> That was really cool.\n\n67\n00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.210\nKinda funny too.\n\n68\n00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.580\nI love what Peter does with those things.\n\n69\n00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.100\n>> Yeah.\nThe crazy thing about that radio is that's\n\n70\n00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.390\nactually a true story.\n\n71\n00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.270\n>> That's actually a true story.\n\n72\n00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.770\n>> Yeah.\nYeah, we kind of built that off of\n\n73\n00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.860\na social engineering event\nthat a friend of mine did and\n\n74\n00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.400\nI mean the idea,\nthe camera is really great one because.\n\n75\n00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.160\nThey pick up opening the doors.\n\n76\n00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.460\nThey just picked up so much stuff, watched\nthe actual video controls in the back.\n\n77\n00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.740\nThey knew where all the cameras were.\n\n78\n00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.480\n>> They had a great visual record of\neverything they would want to know\n\n79\n00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.620\nthere's no mistaking.\n\n80\n00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.540\n>> And under the pretext really,\nof doing something\n\n81\n00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.430\nelse which is really something what\nwere going into in the next chapter.\n\n82\n00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.510\nSo, that has a little bit\nof everything in there.\n\n83\n00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.570\nThere's some free texting,\nthere's some solicitation and\n\n84\n00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.850\nall the components are way what a good\nsocial engineering exploit should be.\n\n85\n00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.796\n>> I found it very interesting that the\nyoung lady there used her feminine wiles.\n\n86\n00:03:46.796 --> 00:03:47.692\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n87\n00:03:47.692 --> 00:03:48.580\n>> To elicit.\n\n88\n00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.340\nThings that she wanted that she wasn't,\nif the direct approach just t asking for\n\n89\n00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.350\nit wasn't getting her anywhere,\nshe would kind of.\n\n90\n00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.429\n>> Yeah, [CROSSTALK] placation.\n\n91\n00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:02.261\n>> Yeah, very funny.\n\n92\n00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:03.503\nAll right, so where do we go from there?\n\n93\n00:04:03.503 --> 00:04:07.116\nNow that we've seen it next we kind of\nknow what solicitation looks like in\n\n94\n00:04:07.116 --> 00:04:11.010\nrealtime, what else do we need to\nknow when it comes to that topic?\n\n95\n00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.985\nWell, in licitation there's\nan area called free loading.\n\n96\n00:04:15.985 --> 00:04:23.110\nOkay, so,\npre-loading is really setting up the event\n\n97\n00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.460\nbecause you know the information\nabout the particular subject I mean,\n\n98\n00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.090\nwe have to go back to our research and\nwe have to.\n\n99\n00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.230\nAnd we do have tons of research we\nhave to find out about the company,\n\n100\n00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.490\nwe need to know how many people\nwork in the offices, likes and\n\n101\n00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.416\ndislikes of those people\nbefore we can use a pre-load.\n\n102\n00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:51.610\nThe pre-load is kinda like I don't know,\nlike when you were in the movies.\n\n103\n00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.760\nYou're sitting there and you just sit\ndown and the next thing you know,\n\n104\n00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.510\nup comes the vision of dancing sodas and\npopcorn and whatever.\n\n105\n00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.460\nYou go I wanna get a snack.\n\n106\n00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.190\nSo that's kinda like preloading and\n\n107\n00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.330\neven the previews before\nthe show is a form of preloading,\n\n108\n00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:18.280\nso preloading has a number of\nelements to it to make it work right.\n\n109\n00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.290\nBut I'll give you a for instance.\n\n110\n00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.940\nSo in these setups of preloading,\nlet's say for instance\n\n111\n00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.929\nI wanted to get my significant other\nto go on a vacation to Jamaica.\n\n112\n00:05:32.929 --> 00:05:33.499\n>> Okay.\n\n113\n00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:34.210\n>> Right?\n\n114\n00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.420\nBut it just cost a little bit\n\n115\n00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.200\ntoo much [INAUDIBLE] wanna\ntake the time off to do it.\n\n116\n00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.210\nI say hey you know I ran\ninto Daniel the other day.\n\n117\n00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.260\nAnd you know just got back from\nthe islands, got back from Jamaica,\n\n118\n00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.560\nhe looks great.\n\n119\n00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.950\nMan it's like he's got a tan.\n\n120\n00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.980\nI've never seen him look better,\nyou know, and then just drop it, but\n\n121\n00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.410\nmaybe the next day let's go out and\nget some Jamaican food.\n\n122\n00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.570\nSo go to a Jamaican restaurant and\n\n123\n00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.590\nI don't know might buy some coconuts,\n>> Yeah.\n\n124\n00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.450\n>> Put some coconuts and\nmake some coconut water\n\n125\n00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.380\nand we use all the elements, so\n\n126\n00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.750\nin fact in there we should take the visual\n>> Right?\n\n127\n00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.620\nVery important that you get an idea of it.\n\n128\n00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.260\nYou wanna have some sounds.\n\n129\n00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.970\n>> Play some reggae.\n\n130\n00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.840\n>> Play some reggae music,\na little Bob Marley.\n\n131\n00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.770\nThe taste, important that we\nkind of enter into that area.\n\n132\n00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:45.640\nWe really want to even get a feel for it.\n\n133\n00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.120\nYou've been having the coconut\nin your hand and feeling that.\n\n134\n00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:56.050\nIt is a really helpful area, and\nin fact, we use a little preloading\n\n135\n00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:01.330\nIf back in Philadelphia,\nmy sons and I, we have a tiki bar.\n\n136\n00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.710\nSo I don't know if you know\nabout the tiki experience, but\n\n137\n00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.920\nthe idea is to try to bring the tropical-\n>> Polynesian, yeah.\n\n138\n00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.540\n>> Island into the middle\nof an urban city,\n\n139\n00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.860\nwhich is kind of cool when it comes\nlike January in the middle of the snow.\n\n140\n00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.800\nYou got the opportunity.\n\n141\n00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.120\nSo, all around the place,\nyou'll have visual things.\n\n142\n00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:33.010\nSo, sometimes a visual might be something\nthat would illustrate the tiki.\n\n143\n00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:33.510\n>> Right.\n\n144\n00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:41.290\nBut there's a little boat floats and\nnetting and\n\n145\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.600\ntiki masks that are up there-\n>> So\n\n146\n00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.628\nall these visual elements-\n>> All these visual elements-\n\n147\n00:07:47.628 --> 00:07:48.899\n>> Audible elements,\n\n148\n00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:50.543\nthe smells, the sounds,\n\n149\n00:07:50.543 --> 00:07:55.177\nthe tastes, the whole nine yards is\nmeant to get you to almost believe that\n\n150\n00:07:55.177 --> 00:07:59.830\nyou're in that actual element and\nbecause of that You start to desire it.\n\n151\n00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:04.080\n>> You start to desire it, but\nthen that leaves you to the tiki drink.\n\n152\n00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.652\nRight, and\nalso the making of the tiki drink,\n\n153\n00:08:07.652 --> 00:08:12.140\nthere's an explosion of pineapple and\ncoconut.\n\n154\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.300\nAnd you actually get the drink and\na coconut, so\n\n155\n00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.940\nyou kind of hold on when\nyou get that whole feeling.\n\n156\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.130\nSo, all those elements I think are really,\n\n157\n00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:26.060\nreally important in bringing\nthe preloading across to you.\n\n158\n00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.100\n>> So you setting a stage really?\n\n159\n00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.140\n>> You're setting a stage.\n\n160\n00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:33.130\n>> And so that the person kind of\njumps into a mind set of well,\n\n161\n00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:38.180\neven though I'm not really there, you've\nbuilt this illusion really of being there.\n\n162\n00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.610\nAnd now I'm gonna start\nthinking in a certain way,\n\n163\n00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.560\nI'm gonna start acting in a certain way.\n\n164\n00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.360\nBecause of that,\n\n165\n00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.090\nI know when I go on vacation,\n>> You relax.\n\n166\n00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.220\n>> Yeah.\n>> You really relax.\n\n167\n00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.320\n>> You settle back down.\n\n168\n00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.710\n>> Right.\n\n169\n00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:54.329\nSo basically if you're going back\nto the story of the vacation,\n\n170\n00:08:54.329 --> 00:08:57.670\nyou'd lay those elements out there.\n\n171\n00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:02.832\nAt some point,\nit might drop a little ad for maybe\n\n172\n00:09:02.832 --> 00:09:09.740\na 10% discount on a cruise to Jamaica,\nyou know what I mean?\n\n173\n00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.275\nAnd sure enough I was seated\nat the dinner table and\n\n174\n00:09:13.275 --> 00:09:16.510\nit's like hey,\nwould you like to go on a cruise?\n\n175\n00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:17.600\n>> All right.\n\n176\n00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.514\n>> Yeah, yeah, I think I could pull it\noff and spend a little time to do it.\n\n177\n00:09:21.514 --> 00:09:23.628\nAnd I've done it [LAUGH].\n\n178\n00:09:23.628 --> 00:09:27.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've done it, I've been there.\n\n179\n00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:33.520\nSo, but I might say something really even\nabout the sound and the audible part.\n\n180\n00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:40.720\nThe music can impact the brain.\n\n181\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:46.150\nIt's gonna impact the endorphins\nthat are released in the body,\n\n182\n00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.605\nmusic can play a really important part.\n\n183\n00:09:48.605 --> 00:09:53.980\nAnd so I don't think we look\nreally at how all these elements,\n\n184\n00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.250\nwe don't look at it enough.\n\n185\n00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:59.410\nHow all these elements really can play to\ncreate that kind of preloading experience.\n\n186\n00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.830\n>> Yeah, I've definitely\nseen music work in that way.\n\n187\n00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.225\nI'm a musician, I've played in bands.\n\n188\n00:10:03.225 --> 00:10:05.635\nDifferent types, different styles.\n\n189\n00:10:05.635 --> 00:10:09.345\nAnd each different style elicits\ndifferent responses from the audience.\n\n190\n00:10:11.265 --> 00:10:13.575\nA metal band, you're seeing the audience,\n\n191\n00:10:13.575 --> 00:10:16.985\nyou see in their faces much\nmore of a sense of power.\n\n192\n00:10:16.985 --> 00:10:20.605\nOr maybe even a bit of aggression,\nbecause the medal is or the metal.\n\n193\n00:10:20.605 --> 00:10:21.605\nThe metal.\n\n194\n00:10:21.605 --> 00:10:22.365\n>> The metal.\n\n195\n00:10:22.365 --> 00:10:26.825\n>> Is powerful and aggressive, so that's\nthe kind of mindset that people get into.\n\n196\n00:10:26.825 --> 00:10:28.970\nIt affects them psychologically,\n\n197\n00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.767\nyou are playing more things like reggae\nmusic or something like Pink Floyd.\n\n198\n00:10:32.767 --> 00:10:36.290\nWe talked about Pink Floyd earlier, you're\ntrying to become more in a relaxed state.\n\n199\n00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.020\n>> Right.\n>> It's a relaxing type of music and\n\n200\n00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.780\npeople tend to relax more\nwhen that's being played.\n\n201\n00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.400\nI've just seen you watch it wash over\nthe crowd when they get into it.\n\n202\n00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.150\nYou play Jimmy Buffett, people are gonna\nwanna sip a mai tai and hang out.\n\n203\n00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.681\nYou play Megadeth.\n\n204\n00:10:50.681 --> 00:10:53.155\n>> Which is what you're\ngonna hear at a tiki bar.\n\n205\n00:10:53.155 --> 00:10:53.859\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n206\n00:10:53.859 --> 00:10:54.838\nYou're gonna hear Jimmy Buffett, yeah.\n\n207\n00:10:54.838 --> 00:10:58.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you're gonna hear reggae,\n\n208\n00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.445\nyou gotta hear all those sounds.\n\n209\n00:11:01.445 --> 00:11:06.440\nBut as well, look at national anthems and\n\n210\n00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.820\nnational music and\nhow they create the sense of pride.\n\n211\n00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:15.098\nListen to the sounds at a sporting event,\n\n212\n00:11:15.098 --> 00:11:18.773\nhow they kind of pump up the volume.\n\n213\n00:11:18.773 --> 00:11:23.679\nSo it's all a form of preloading,\nit's all really a kind of a way of not so\n\n214\n00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:28.040\nmuch listening information with\npeople from getting up there.\n\n215\n00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:35.090\nSo, basically all these are elements of it\n\n216\n00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:39.990\nthat you're enhancing our awareness and\nhelping us understand it.\n\n217\n00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:45.291\nNow, mastering elicitation,\n\n218\n00:11:45.291 --> 00:11:52.170\nokay, requires a study of your subject.\n\n219\n00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.310\nI can't emphasize this enough,\nyou really need to do your research,\n\n220\n00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.040\nyou need to do your homework.\n\n221\n00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.100\nThere's no way that you can do something\nas sophisticated as preloading without\n\n222\n00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:10.740\nunderstanding all the elements of\nwhat a person would like to do.\n\n223\n00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.515\nIt's a natural thing, we wanna try to\nbe as natural as possible with it.\n\n224\n00:12:14.515 --> 00:12:19.195\nFor instance, you go into a conversation,\n\n225\n00:12:19.195 --> 00:12:20.915\nin fact these are some\nthings that you can do.\n\n226\n00:12:20.915 --> 00:12:26.660\nI'm gonna give you some examples and\nsome ways to kind of practice elicitation.\n\n227\n00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:31.410\nBut when you get in a conversation\nrather than talking about yourself,\n\n228\n00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:36.630\nwhich is okay, you really wanna\ndo that but talk to the person.\n\n229\n00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:42.864\nHey, where you from,\nI notice you have a different accent,\n\n230\n00:12:42.864 --> 00:12:46.295\nyou're not from around here, are you?\n\n231\n00:12:46.295 --> 00:12:48.176\nNo, I'm actually from Boston.\n\n232\n00:12:48.176 --> 00:12:54.790\nSo it's great.\n\n233\n00:12:54.790 --> 00:13:00.120\nWell, I notice I've been to Cape Cod,\nfrom that area.\n\n234\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.482\n>> Yeah.\n>> It went it all, yeah,\n\n235\n00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:08.550\nnow I'm actually from further\nup with the mountain area.\n\n236\n00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:13.310\nI mean that's one way to kind\nof really deal with people.\n\n237\n00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:21.420\nThink about when with kind of practice\nyou're elicitation in an easy,\n\n238\n00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.410\nrelaxed way.\n\n239\n00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:28.584\nGet a restaurant,\nme talking to the waiter, same thing,\n\n240\n00:13:28.584 --> 00:13:35.200\nhey, I noticed that yeah,\nhave a little different accent.\n\n241\n00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.670\n>> Yeah.\n>> You from around here?\n\n242\n00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:43.600\nMaybe I'm talking to the bartender,\nsame thing.\n\n243\n00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:50.270\nPerhaps you can from that\nperson extract a phone number.\n\n244\n00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:57.394\nFind out where they went to school,\n\n245\n00:13:57.394 --> 00:14:02.480\npick a subject, pick an area, your topic,\n\n246\n00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.200\neducation or even occupation.\n\n247\n00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.340\nHey, what do you do?\n\n248\n00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.310\nYeah, besides it's all you do or\nyou have a job somewhere.\n\n249\n00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:18.038\nThese are all now kind of harmless things,\nbut there are ways that you can practice\n\n250\n00:14:18.038 --> 00:14:22.910\nyour technique of open ended questions.\n\n251\n00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:27.750\nAnd then leading them into something,\nthat person that did say\n\n252\n00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:32.710\nthey were from Boston, say hey,\nwell, I've been out on the cape.\n\n253\n00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.020\nIs that where you're from?\n\n254\n00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.600\nSo I just kind of led him to the point,\nyes or no.\n\n255\n00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.450\n>> Right.\n\n256\n00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.547\n>> Yeah, so you know truero?\n\n257\n00:14:39.547 --> 00:14:42.710\nYeah, yeah, no, I'm from province.\n\n258\n00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:48.140\nBut it helps I think a lot because\nwhen you get into the field and\n\n259\n00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.640\nyou're getting into an actual endeavor.\n\n260\n00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.114\nThen you'll be able to circle and\nkind of then pinpoint\n\n261\n00:14:55.114 --> 00:15:00.480\nthe information that you're\nreally after have future payment.\n\n262\n00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.410\n>> I'm trying to throw it into an IT\ncontext, so I guess what I would do\n\n263\n00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:10.220\nis if I were trying to illicit information\nfrom maybe one of the IT people.\n\n264\n00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:15.580\nOr maybe people that know IT people,\nif I've done my proper reconnaissance.\n\n265\n00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:20.030\nI know who those people are and say yeah,\nI'm trying to get an IT myself.\n\n266\n00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.040\nAnd I'm just fascinated by the subject.\n\n267\n00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.770\nDo you guys do cloud or you basically\ngot a big server room full of stuff?\n\n268\n00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.190\nYeah, we got a really cool server room.\n\n269\n00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:34.160\nBecause I've noticed that IT guys love to\ntalk about how big the racks are, right?,\n\n270\n00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.230\nwhat servers they're running.\n\n271\n00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:39.762\nYou guys running on a Hyper V or\nan ESX shop with virtualization?\n\n272\n00:15:39.762 --> 00:15:43.610\nWell, we run the ESX,\nokay I'm getting very good information and\n\n273\n00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.440\nit's just talking shop.\n\n274\n00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.927\nBut I'm getting a lot of information\nout of the person that I want.\n\n275\n00:15:48.927 --> 00:15:53.589\nCuz now I know if they're on ESX, you need\nto make sure to keep that thing patched,\n\n276\n00:15:53.589 --> 00:15:54.277\nall right.\n\n277\n00:15:54.277 --> 00:15:55.349\nYeah, you're up-to-date.\n\n278\n00:15:55.349 --> 00:15:57.806\nYeah, we make sure to run the latest and\ngreatest the LK9 or\n\n279\n00:15:57.806 --> 00:15:59.488\nwhat version you're running, right?\n\n280\n00:15:59.488 --> 00:16:02.279\nAnd it's just, we're just two\nguys having a conversation or\n\n281\n00:16:02.279 --> 00:16:05.190\nwe're just two people having\na conversation about something.\n\n282\n00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:09.450\nAnd I'm getting very specific information\nthat normally I'd have to run things like\n\n283\n00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.910\nan end map scan with OS versioning or\n\n284\n00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.610\nsome sort of meta split attack\nto start learning these things.\n\n285\n00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.790\nI'm just getting it out of the guy's\ndirect from the horses' mouth or\n\n286\n00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.360\nsomething simpler.\n\n287\n00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:26.070\nYou could actually see\nwhat they're hiring for.\n\n288\n00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:27.770\nGo to their job sites.\n\n289\n00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:28.790\nGo to their website.\n\n290\n00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.628\nLook in [CROSSTALK] job requirements,\nwhat they're hiring for, sure.\n\n291\n00:16:32.628 --> 00:16:34.900\nSay yeah, we're looking really for\n\n292\n00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.910\nsomebody who is\nCertified Cloud Professional.\n\n293\n00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.800\nWe want Cisco only, they'll lay it out.\n\n294\n00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.020\nGuys have Juniper knowledge, so\n\n295\n00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:49.895\nyou can get a real good idea of the kind\nof infrastructure thatthey have.\n\n296\n00:16:49.895 --> 00:16:55.325\nAnd if you're planning, really,\nto use the IT professional scam,\n\n297\n00:16:55.325 --> 00:16:59.465\nthe way you're going to\ngo into a company as it,\n\n298\n00:16:59.465 --> 00:17:06.445\nyou better make sure that they have\nan actual in-house IT representative.\n\n299\n00:17:06.445 --> 00:17:13.380\nAs well, with all these things, you\nneed to have Plan B, maybe even plan C.\n\n300\n00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.894\n>> Contingencies for\nour contingencies right?\n\n301\n00:17:15.894 --> 00:17:20.550\n>> Yeah,It's Important bibing,\nbut I'd say what we don't really\n\n302\n00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:25.330\nhave ,we don't really\nhave anybody that is from\n\n303\n00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:28.989\nthe South Side Company at all since they\nwere, actually we were just out-sourced.\n\n304\n00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:37.890\nTo do work for ABC, networking, and\nwe're in here to, really check the cables.\n\n305\n00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.340\nWe heard there's a cable problem.\n\n306\n00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.320\nAnd because my research told me that Mr.\n\n307\n00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.540\nJones is actually in charge\nof the whole networking job.\n\n308\n00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.410\nSo Jones is the one that called me.\n\n309\n00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:49.540\nI don't know, I mean Be.\n\n310\n00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:54.980\nYou wanna pay me for the day,\nsend me, or let me go do my job.\n\n311\n00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.960\nOkay, Mr. Jones is on vacation.\n\n312\n00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.765\nYeah, I knew that, but dang.\n\n313\n00:18:02.765 --> 00:18:06.630\n[LAUGH] And at that point, throw a fit.\n\n314\n00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.615\n>> Start getting indignant, right?\n\n315\n00:18:09.615 --> 00:18:13.610\n[LAUGH] Listen I was told to be here,\nI got a work order right here\n\n316\n00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:17.730\nthat says I'm supposed to take\ncare of this cable issue.\n\n317\n00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.420\nYou need to let me into that room,\nand okay.\n\n318\n00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:24.000\nWell listen I ain't got time for\nyou to around, find out the authorization.\n\n319\n00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.130\nI need to get this done or\nyou're not gonna be able to do your job.\n\n320\n00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.490\nYou gotta let me in this place so I can\nget this done I can go home to my kids.\n\n321\n00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:30.330\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n322\n00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.130\nWell another trick would be rather\nthan get angry at them again we\n\n323\n00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.670\ntalked yesterday about-\n>> We talked about\n\n324\n00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.300\nabout assertive vs aggressive.\n\n325\n00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:38.990\n>> Yeah.\n\n326\n00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:42.500\n>> Okay.\nSimply get aggressive with somebody else.\n\n327\n00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.720\nGet your phone out.\n\n328\n00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.660\nI don't know you sent me the heck here.\n\n329\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.020\nI don't know why.\n\n330\n00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.080\nI'm waiting around here,\nI'm wasting my time, wasting gas.\n\n331\n00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.820\nI got other thing I got to do.\n\n332\n00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:59.300\nThat kind of anger directed at\nsomebody else will help that person to\n\n333\n00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.730\nmake a decision, and say well, they'll-\n>> You kinda bring them to\n\n334\n00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:05.310\nyour side that way.\n\n335\n00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.750\n>> Yeah,\nbring them on to your side that way, yeah.\n\n336\n00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.060\n>> That's a\n>> That's a good idea.\n\n337\n00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.460\nNow are there times when you want\nto go aggressive versus assertive,\n\n338\n00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:15.660\nand to vise versa or is that just kind\n\n339\n00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:20.440\nof an intuition thing where you see that\nmaybe this person is a little more docile,\n\n340\n00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:25.660\nand is probably going to react the way\nyou want if you get aggressive.\n\n341\n00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.870\nVersus this person's gonna through up a\nbrick wall if I get aggressive with them,\n\n342\n00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:29.700\nI needed to go assertive.\n\n343\n00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:34.080\n>> I think aggressive is one\nof those things that you\n\n344\n00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.200\nwant to always hold back unless\nthere's a threat involved.\n\n345\n00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.090\n>> Gotcha.\n\n346\n00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.490\n>> Because usually gonna create fear.\n\n347\n00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:50.820\nYou're gonna accelerate somebody's fear of\nyou and then you're gonna turn them off.\n\n348\n00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.760\nYou're gonna create an isolation\nbetween the two of you so\n\n349\n00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:59.000\nI would say that's always a last recourse.\n\n350\n00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.409\n>> So always better to-\n>> Always better to [CROSSTALK] Yeah,\n\n351\n00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:06.365\nexactly, always better to kind of\nsmooth your way in there, okay.\n\n352\n00:20:06.365 --> 00:20:10.553\nYeah, yeah, but be natural about it.\n\n353\n00:20:10.553 --> 00:20:11.099\n>> Right.\n\n354\n00:20:11.099 --> 00:20:14.080\n>> And I can't emphasize that again.\n\n355\n00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.820\nBe practical, be simplistic try not to\n\n356\n00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:24.580\nhave your licitation too complex.\n\n357\n00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.530\nDon't ask the person too\nmany questions at once.\n\n358\n00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:32.090\nOne question at a time and\nthat's the way to kind of lead on.\n\n359\n00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:36.350\nBe very, very simple in your approach with\n\n360\n00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:41.980\nit because the more complex\nyour whole make up the more\n\n361\n00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:47.630\ndifficult it is to pull it off and\nthe more red flags you're gonna throw up.\n\n362\n00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:50.790\n>> Right, so\nany time that you get out of context, or\n\n363\n00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:55.700\nyou start almost interrogating them,\nthat's going to, a lot of times, get that.\n\n364\n00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.180\n>> Sure, you're gonna get a reaction,\nyou're gonna get a reaction back from\n\n365\n00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:02.360\nthe person, so now\n>> You know that you've actually created\n\n366\n00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.410\nsome dissonance and\nyou've gotta backtrack.\n\n367\n00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:11.610\nYou get too many dissonance checks,\nsay, this person isn't credible.\n\n368\n00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.810\nYou need to create confidence.\n\n369\n00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:20.510\nYou need to create rapport and\nyou need to build on that.\n\n370\n00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:22.100\nBuild on that trust.\n\n371\n00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.490\n>> If they trust you, if they like you,\nthen they're more apt to-\n\n372\n00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:25.710\n>> They trust them, like them.\n\n373\n00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:30.860\nThey are the components of all these\nelements gave that most people that\n\n374\n00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.050\nare natural at it, and\nthat's one of the things.\n\n375\n00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:37.240\nYou may be a natural at\nthis type of endeavor,\n\n376\n00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.170\nthat's who you wanna use similarities,\n\n377\n00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:47.280\nwhat do I know that this person knows?\n\n378\n00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.370\nSo I read up on the person,\nI saw that they were into scuba, you know?\n\n379\n00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.370\n>> Yeah.\n>> And as I'm fumbling with my ID,\n\n380\n00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.690\nI drop my scuba card out.\n\n381\n00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.850\nYou're into scuba?\n\n382\n00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.760\nYeah!\nI love to dive, you know?\n\n383\n00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.450\nAnd it lets you create a similarity.\n\n384\n00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.490\nBecause people, certainly likeness,\n\n385\n00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:11.050\nhelps to build trusted rapport,\nand those are two big words.\n\n386\n00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:16.050\n>> People tend to like people\nthat are like themselves.\n\n387\n00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:21.430\n>> If you head into elicitation properly\nyou kind of build that rapport all along,\n\n388\n00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:26.280\nbecause you asked some questions where you\nare from, you know the area, what you do,\n\n389\n00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.110\nwhat you\n>> What are you likes and dislikes?\n\n390\n00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:31.180\nReally the sky's the limit.\n\n391\n00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:36.660\nYou can ask as many questions as you want,\nat the same time,\n\n392\n00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:42.010\nfeeling the check,\nfeeling the report back from the person.\n\n393\n00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:48.110\nIs that person starting to move away,\nkind of tighten up,\n\n394\n00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:53.010\nor are you getting more of a relax and\nthey'll start talking.\n\n395\n00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.760\n>> And that all comes from\njust being tactful, right, and\n\n396\n00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.960\nfiguring out how they're responding and\nadjusting your tact accordingly.\n\n397\n00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.700\nI used to have a friend that had a little\nsaying over their refrigerator that said,\n\n398\n00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.090\ntact is the ability to tell a man to go to\nhell and have him happy to be on his way.\n\n399\n00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.090\n>> There you go.\n>> Right, and\n\n400\n00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:12.100\nyou can say anything you want\n>> As long as you do it tactfully and\n\n401\n00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.110\nthey'll respond in a positive way.\n\n402\n00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:15.740\n>> Yeah.\nI think you're just true.\n\n403\n00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.428\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n404\n00:23:17.428 --> 00:23:22.223\n>> There's a lot to be said about that.\n\n405\n00:23:22.223 --> 00:23:22.884\nOkay.\n\n406\n00:23:22.884 --> 00:23:28.780\nAnd of course certainly\nyou need to like people.\n\n407\n00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:34.140\nAnd you've got to be able to\nexpress that in a comfortable\n\n408\n00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.250\na way that sets them comfortable.\n\n409\n00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:42.356\nI would certainly trust in that, but\nif you don't like people, probably you're\n\n410\n00:23:42.356 --> 00:23:47.174\nnot gonna get very well, very far with\na sort of social engineering exploit.\n\n411\n00:23:47.174 --> 00:23:52.927\n>> So an approach like this, hi,\nI see that you're into baseball.\n\n412\n00:23:52.927 --> 00:23:55.175\nI'm into baseball, too.\n\n413\n00:23:55.175 --> 00:23:56.547\n[NOISE]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n414\n00:23:56.547 --> 00:23:57.669\n>> Probably not gonna get you very\n\n415\n00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:58.191\nfar, right?\n\n416\n00:23:58.191 --> 00:24:00.450\n>> Yeah, probably not.\n>> You wanna be, hey, how's it going?\n\n417\n00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:01.870\nCool.\nYour into baseball?\n\n418\n00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.970\nMan, how are the Sox doing this year?\n\n419\n00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.900\nI haven't been following cuz it's\njust too much for me to bear.\n\n420\n00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.400\n>> But I love watching the games.\n\n421\n00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.160\nI love being out there.\n\n422\n00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.350\n>> Yeah, exactly.\nAll of a sudden,\n\n423\n00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.410\nwe're, a little personable.\n\n424\n00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.540\nYou're into something that they're into.\n\n425\n00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.450\n>> It's an element really kinda builds and\n\n426\n00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.600\nadds to the whole makeup\nof what we're doing, yes.\n\n427\n00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.420\n>> Anything else we need to know, Tom?\n\n428\n00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.860\nI know we're running a little short\non time, but this is great stuff.\n\n429\n00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:24.420\n>> I don't know.\n\n430\n00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:27.300\nTry them at a sporting event.\n\n431\n00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.780\nHey, man,\nwho's your favorite player on the team?\n\n432\n00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.020\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's one of the things you can do.\n\n433\n00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.949\nThen try to go for bigger targets.\n\n434\n00:24:37.949 --> 00:24:39.068\nSocial Security number.\n\n435\n00:24:39.068 --> 00:24:41.121\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n436\n00:24:41.121 --> 00:24:45.030\n>> You play dollar social security Bingo.\n\n437\n00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:51.010\nSay hey I got a bill here in my pocket and\nI'll tell you what.\n\n438\n00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:52.300\nLet's play some Bingo.\n\n439\n00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.794\n>> Okay.\n>> So, I need four numbers,\n\n440\n00:24:55.794 --> 00:24:59.418\nlike your social security.\n\n441\n00:24:59.418 --> 00:25:02.104\nThat would be three, I got a three.\n\n442\n00:25:02.104 --> 00:25:04.270\nYou got a three in your\nsocial security number?\n\n443\n00:25:04.270 -->

pre-texting really\nis the act of behaving,\n\n13\n00:00:44.776 --> 00:00:50.292\ndressing, utilizing mannerisms\n\n14\n00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:55.806\nof someone else, to play a part and\n\n15\n00:00:55.806 --> 00:01:01.321\nplay a role to allow yourself to get\n\n16\n00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:06.660\nfurther into a person's trust.\n\n17\n00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.420\nA instance might be as we're\ngonna roll out a video here.\n\n18\n00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.279\nSay I want to get into a company and\nI'm gonna go in,\n\n19\n00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:17.768\nI'm gonna pretext of\nbeing an exterminator.\n\n20\n00:01:17.768 --> 00:01:21.425\nSo I'm gonna have to put on a uniform for\na particular company.\n\n21\n00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:23.750\nIt would be nice to show up in a truck.\n\n22\n00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.590\nMaybe I could take like little plastic\nsigns, put them on the side of it.\n\n23\n00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.880\nSo just so everybody can see the truck and\nwalk into the place.\n\n24\n00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.612\nCertainly, you'll have\nsome exterminator gear.\n\n25\n00:01:36.612 --> 00:01:40.635\nHave the exterminator hat and\nsmell like an exterminator,\n\n26\n00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:44.160\nact like an exterminator,\nbe an exterminator.\n\n27\n00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.600\n>> So, it's taking the phrase\nthe devil's in the details.\n\n28\n00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.430\n>> Yeah.\n\n29\n00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.180\n>> To Nth degree and becoming,\nbasically like an actor.\n\n30\n00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.990\nWhere we're playing a role\nof an exterminator and\n\n31\n00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.470\nif I want my audience to believe me, then\nI need to look the part, sound the part,\n\n32\n00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.710\nsmell the part, taste the part,\neverything about it.\n\n33\n00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.230\n>> Yeah.\n>> So,\n\n34\n00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.290\nthat all of my credibility is there and\nthe disbelief gets suspended\n\n35\n00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.620\nfrom the people that I want\nit to be suspended from.\n\n36\n00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.472\n>> Let's take a phrase from\nChris Hadnaggy's book Social Engineering.\n\n37\n00:02:12.472 --> 00:02:19.506\nHonesty is the key to a relationship but\nif you can fake it, you're in.\n\n38\n00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:24.484\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, with that let's roll\n\n39\n00:02:24.484 --> 00:02:29.691\nthis animation that Peter and\nI have worked on and\n\n40\n00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:36.052\nit should give you a little idea\nof the context and pretext.\n\n41\n00:02:36.052 --> 00:02:39.276\n>> [SOUND]\n>> Hi,\n\n42\n00:02:39.276 --> 00:02:41.960\nthis is James Smith from\nBegone Extermination.\n\n43\n00:02:41.960 -->

00:02:52.110\n>> No,\nwe have a company that does that already.\n\n46\n00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.610\n>> Well I see.\n\n47\n00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.950\nAnd I'm sure you're very\nhappy with their service but\n\n48\n00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.670\ndo they guarantee that\nyou will be pest free?\n\n49\n00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.480\n>> No.\n>> Do they provide you with a checklist of\n\n50\n00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.610\nall the areas near a building\nthat can be hotspots for pests.\n\n51\n00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.720\n>> Well, they seem to be pretty thorough.\n\n52\n00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.410\n>> Do they offer safe,\nnon-toxic alternatives for pest control?\n\n53\n00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.400\n>> I think so.\n\n54\n00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.100\n>> Well, who is this company that\ncan offer such exceptional service.\n\n55\n00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.790\n>> They're called Pest Away.\n\n56\n00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.640\n>> Would

make that decision.\n\n59\n00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.980\nYou'll have to call back\nwhen the boss is here.\n\n60\n00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.362\n>> And what's the boss's name?\n\n61\n00:03:25.362 -->

context of our little venue up there.\n\n90\n00:04:44.445 --> 00:04:47.540\n>> Right,\nwell I'd say the first thing is research.\n\n91\n00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.780\nSo research is kind of two fold.\n\n92\n00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:58.730\nFirst, you need to know what type\nof a act to put out there for\n\n93\n00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:05.470\nthe subject and then you need to research\nthe nature and the behavior of the act.\n\n94\n00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.280\nSo both of those elements are important.\n\n95\n00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.255\nYou're going to pretext that\nyou're a med student and\n\n96\n00:05:14.255 --> 00:05:20.090\nyou're going into the medical school,\nyou need to understand the behavior and\n\n97\n00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.180\nnature of a medical student,\nwhat are they carrying\n\n98\n00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.340\nwhat kind of books do they have so,\nthat's important.\n\n99\n00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.930\nAt the same time you need to know the\nnature of the subject you're going after.\n\n100\n00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.110\n>> Yeah, a specific example I can think\nof at least somewhat in this vein is,\n\n101\n00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.590\nanybody that knows me,\nknows that I love military stuff.\n\n102\n00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.800\nI'm just fascinated with things like,\nspecialists, special forces,\n\n103\n00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.820\nwe talked about this-\n>> Yeah.\n\n104\n00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.440\n>> Yesterday.\n\n105\n00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.987\nThe elite special forces will\ngo what they call go native.\n\n106\n00:05:52.987 --> 00:05:57.376\nThey grow out beards, longer hair, they\nwear clothing that's in congruence with\n\n107\n00:05:57.376 --> 00:06:01.780\nthe area in which they're being dropped\nin so that they can do reconnaissance.\n\n108\n00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.717\nThey don't stick out, they don't\nlook like, someone, like a soldier,\n\n109\n00:06:05.717 --> 00:06:07.474\nthey don't look like a soldier.\n\n110\n00:06:07.474 --> 00:06:11.708\nThey look like maybe somebody\nthat's there as a reporter or\n\n111\n00:06:11.708 --> 00:06:16.451\nsomeone on vacation,\nwho is now actually gaining intelligence,\n\n112\n00:06:16.451 --> 00:06:20.940\nlooking for information that they\nneed to complete a mission or\n\n113\n00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.790\nmaybe find a target for interrogation or\nsomething to that effect.\n\n114\n00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.760\nBut they do that, they go native,\nthey look like the people around them.\n\n115\n00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.360\nSo they fit in and\n\n116\n00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.615\nthey don't necessarily catch the eye of\nthe people that might be looking for them.\n\n117\n00:06:35.615 --> 00:06:37.215\nThat's the whole purpose of that.\n\n118\n00:06:37.215 --> 00:06:38.055\nIs that pre-texting?\n\n119\n00:06:38.055 --> 00:06:39.145\n>> That's pre-texting.\n\n120\n00:06:39.145 --> 00:06:42.245\nIn fact,\nI'll give you the inverse of that.\n\n121\n00:06:42.245 --> 00:06:46.875\nIt's still pre-texting, but when I was in\nthe military, I spent time in Germany.\n\n122\n00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:53.500\nGIs around the world\nalways have a reputation.\n\n123\n00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.600\nIt's hard to get away from that.\n\n124\n00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.250\nEspecially if you walk\naround in your fatigues.\n\n125\n00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.715\nSo naturally, and\nI know GIs all over the world do this,\n\n126\n00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:08.367\nthey'll try to dress and\nblend in as natively as\n\n127\n00:07:08.367 --> 00:07:12.575\nthey can to pretext that they aren't a GI.\n\n128\n00:07:12.575 --> 00:07:17.033\nBecause there's always going\nto be a perception and\n\n129\n00:07:17.033 --> 00:07:22.210\na attitude that's gonna be\ndirected towards the GI on duty.\n\n130\n00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.855\nWe played a role of\npretexting all the time.\n\n131\n00:07:25.855 --> 00:07:28.965\nFor instance, if, let's say,\nyou're going into the bank for a loan.\n\n132\n00:07:29.985 --> 00:07:36.475\nWell, you wanna give a good pretext as to,\nhey, I'm a trustworthy person.\n\n133\n00:07:36.475 --> 00:07:38.205\nYou're gonna dress the role.\n\n134\n00:07:38.205 --> 00:07:39.575\nYou're gonna play the role.\n\n135\n00:07:39.575 --> 00:07:45.163\nYou're gonna try to not be out of\ntune with what the bank officer or\n\n136\n00:07:45.163 --> 00:07:47.916\nthe loan officer is expecting.\n\n137\n00:07:47.916 --> 00:07:52.827\n>> Yeah, so if I walk in,\nmy pants have holes in them, I'm unshaven,\n\n138\n00:07:52.827 --> 00:07:56.531\nmy hair is undone if I had hair,\nand I look unkempt,\n\n139\n00:07:56.531 --> 00:08:00.948\nthey're gonna be,\nthis might be a bad loan risk right here.\n\n140\n00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:03.822\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm sure each and every case,\n\n141\n00:08:03.822 --> 00:08:09.509\nevery loan officer does it, but\nI think that that's on their checklist.\n\n142\n00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:11.610\nA tire [INAUDIBLE]\n>> You know when I sold Kirby vacuums,\n\n143\n00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.566\nI used to sell Kirby vacuum\ncleaners back in the day,\n\n144\n00:08:13.566 --> 00:08:16.060\none of the questions we would ask is-\n>> So did I!\n\n145\n00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:16.640\n>> Did you really?\n\n146\n00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.360\n>> Yeah.\n>> Look at that.\n\n147\n00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.220\n>> Hey, we got something in common.\n\n148\n00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.045\n>> Yeah, we're in common there.\n\n149\n00:08:19.045 --> 00:08:20.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But one of the questions we would\n\n150\n00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.930\nask is what do you do for a living?\n\n151\n00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.550\nWe're just making chit-chat.\n\n152\n00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:24.980\nWhat do you do?\n\n153\n00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.250\nWell, I work as a waitress.\n\n154\n00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:33.400\nI know now you probably can't afford this\nthing, because it was extremely expensive.\n\n155\n00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.106\nAnd that was one of those things\nthat we did to figure out,\n\n156\n00:08:38.106 --> 00:08:44.300\nit was like pre-qualifying them\nwithout pre-qualifying them overtly.\n\n157\n00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:44.920\n>> Yes.\n\n158\n00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.700\nSo the in the planning and\nthe research phase,\n\n159\n00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.980\nI can't emphasize this enough that you\nreally need to spend time, understand\n\n160\n00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.830\nall the parameters,\nall the characteristics of your subject.\n\n161\n00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.700\nThe more time you spend in that and\nunderstand it, the better it is that\n\n162\n00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:12.200\nyou're pretext is actually going to work,\npull off.\n\n163\n00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.650\nAnother thing would be\nutilize similarities.\n\n164\n00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:22.340\nThis kind of goes a little bit into\nhow to become a better pretexter.\n\n165\n00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.470\nIf you really want to\nbe good at pretexting,\n\n166\n00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.140\nwhat's the greatest examples\nthat we have in pretexting?\n\n167\n00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.140\nFilms.\n\n168\n00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:29.640\nMovies.\n\n169\n00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.470\nThe actor alone is pretexting, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.510\nAnd those actors have different methods.\n\n171\n00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.310\nI mean there's a classical\nmethod of acting where\n\n172\n00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:47.960\nthey'll actually take on the persona\nof the role they're playing.\n\n173\n00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.110\nThey'll research everything about them.\n\n174\n00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.910\nThey'll gain weight.\n\n175\n00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:58.510\nThey'll grow a beard, clean shaven,\nshave their head, whatever.\n\n176\n00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:05.430\nTry to be as surly as they are,\nto be as strong as they are or\n\n177\n00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:10.160\nas emaciated as a role might be where\nsomebody's stranded on an island.\n\n178\n00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.924\nI mean they've gotta play that whole bit.\n\n179\n00:10:11.924 --> 00:10:17.110\nVersus method acting which\nis in the inverse of it,\n\n180\n00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:22.390\nyou try to tap into the things that you\nknow, that you are, that similarities.\n\n181\n00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.210\nAnd the same thing goes for this.\n\n182\n00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:30.140\nIt's easier probably to pretext doing\nsomething that you know already.\n\n183\n00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.210\nYou would, itâd be easier if you\nwere in the information technology\n\n184\n00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.940\nfield to pretext as an information\ntechnology specialist.\n\n185\n00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.920\n>> Cuz you have a foundation of knowledge.\n\n186\n00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.350\n>> You have a foundation,\nsomething to work with, yeah and so\n\n187\n00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.590\nit wouldnât be a great idea to\nwell do the medical pretext and\n\n188\n00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:50.410\nhaving no understanding of anatomy and\nphysiology.\n\n189\n00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.100\n>> Listen, I watched Quincy.\n\n190\n00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.985\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, I'm dumbass.\n\n191\n00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:58.380\n[LAUGH]\n>> Without a doubt.\n\n192\n00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:04.300\nJust we got great ideas of pretexting\nreally from watching our TV shows,\n\n193\n00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.100\nwatching our movies, watching our actors,\nthat's important stuff.\n\n194\n00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.550\nSo I think similarity\nis really an important\n\n195\n00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:17.660\nkey to be able to tap into that\nto utilize things that you know.\n\n196\n00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:23.650\nAnd certainly,\ntry to keep your pretext simple.\n\n197\n00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:33.150\nLike anything else in engineering,\nespecially social engineering,\n\n198\n00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:38.180\nthe more complex the system,\nthe more complex the plan,\n\n199\n00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.390\nthe more possibility for it breaking down.\n\n200\n00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:46.040\nAnd then creating that dissonance as well.\n\n201\n00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:52.600\nSo you asked a question,\nwhich branch of medicine are you studying?\n\n202\n00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:55.550\nBrain Surgery.\n\n203\n00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:59.250\nSo what do you know about\nthe occipital cortex?\n\n204\n00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.260\nI'm just starting.\n\n205\n00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.900\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n>> No, actually I'm in dentistry.\n\n206\n00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.950\nI've got the whole different area.\n\n207\n00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.620\nSo I think that your complexity,\n\n208\n00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:18.400\ntrying to keep your plans as simple as\npossible is an important one to deal with.\n\n209\n00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.726\n>> All right,\nkeep it simple stupid, right?\n\n210\n00:12:20.726 --> 00:12:22.520\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, KISS principle.\n\n211\n00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.632\nI would have said keep\nit simple sweetheart.\n\n212\n00:12:24.632 --> 00:12:25.517\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n213\n00:12:25.517 --> 00:12:28.540\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> I had a coach that would disagree with\n\n214\n00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.085\nyou on that.\n\n215\n00:12:30.085 --> 00:12:33.340\n[LAUGH]\n>> And spontaneity.\n\n216\n00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:38.417\nYou gotta be able to kind\nof roll with the punches.\n\n217\n00:12:38.417 --> 00:12:39.451\nKind of keep moving.\n\n218\n00:12:39.451 --> 00:12:44.878\nI think there's one key term and\nthat is learn to move.\n\n219\n00:12:44.878 --> 00:12:48.185\nDon't stand still in any\nof these situations.\n\n220\n00:12:48.185 --> 00:12:49.691\n>> Think on your feet.\n\n221\n00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:51.655\n>> Think on your feet.\n\n222\n00:12:51.655 --> 00:12:58.595\nYeah, you've just got to keep moving and\nreally in a pretext, have a plan B.\n\n223\n00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:05.100\nShould you get questioned about something,\nand\n\n224\n00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:10.250\nall pretexts aren't really\ndone person to person.\n\n225\n00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.850\nSo a pretext person to\nperson is one thing,\n\n226\n00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:19.590\nbecause you really need to have the dress,\nthe story, the attire, the attitude,\n\n227\n00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:24.710\nthe mannerisms, you need all of\nthose elements to pull that off.\n\n228\n00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.790\nBut a pretext is on\nthe phone just as well.\n\n229\n00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.450\n>> Yeah, so our exterminator could have\nbeen sitting at his house [INAUDIBLE].\n\n230\n00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.420\n>> Well,\nour exterminator was sitting at the house.\n\n231\n00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.880\n>> Well, I think he was in a coffee shop\nbut he's still dressed as an exterminator.\n\n232\n00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.220\nHe could have as easily been\nsitting on his lounge chair\n\n233\n00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.360\nin his jammies with a bowl of\npopcorn watching a movie and\n\n234\n00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.620\ncalling this person on the phone,\nand doing the whole thing.\n\n235\n00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.600\nAnd then when he showed up,\nhe would then need to, now we've gone from\n\n236\n00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.220\nperson over the phone to person in person,\nand now you need to build that pretext.\n\n237\n00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:59.840\n>> And yet\nstill his pretext was via the phone.\n\n238\n00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.220\nSo sometimes we overlook\nthe phone as a tool.\n\n239\n00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.250\nSo you may go well,\n\n240\n00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:11.110\nI really don't need to envelop myself\nin this role because I'm on the phone.\n\n241\n00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.180\nThey ain't gonna be seeing me.\n\n242\n00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.000\nBut it might be smart to\nactually dress the part.\n\n243\n00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.620\nIt's-\n>> It's kind of\n\n244\n00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:16.860\nget yourself in the mindset.\n\n245\n00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.580\n>> I mean, yeah, think like Halloween.\n\n246\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:19.390\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's like,\n\n247\n00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.590\nwhen people put on\na costume they transform.\n\n248\n00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:28.370\nI mean, it's part of the ritual of it,\npart of the psychological change.\n\n249\n00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:32.400\nSo, by doing that,\nwhen people put on costumes,\n\n250\n00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.200\nthey actually act differently, though.\n\n251\n00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.650\nAn introverted person\nwill become extroverted.\n\n252\n00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:41.108\nIt could be a big help.\n\n253\n00:14:41.108 --> 00:14:42.312\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n254\n00:14:42.312 --> 00:14:43.935\n>> Put on a bear costume.\n\n255\n00:14:43.935 --> 00:14:44.720\n[LAUGH]\n>> It is funny,\n\n256\n00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.442\nbecause if you look at internet culture,\nspecifically.\n\n257\n00:14:47.442 --> 00:14:54.430\nPeople that tend to be introverted\nexternally when they're\n\n258\n00:14:54.430 --> 00:15:00.410\ndealing with people face to face, they\nshut down, they're quiet, they're demure.\n\n259\n00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.390\nBut when they get online, all of a sudden\nit's a whole different person because\n\n260\n00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.780\nthey almost have a mask\nbecause of the anonymity.\n\n261\n00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.973\nThey have a costume on of,\nI can be whatever I want.\n\n262\n00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:09.429\n>> It allows you to be whatever you want.\n\n263\n00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:12.893\n>> And they open up.\n>> Yeah, right, right.\n\n264\n00:15:12.893 --> 00:15:20.140\nAnother element that we wanna\nconsider is hard to verify.\n\n265\n00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:25.940\nYou want to make it difficult for\nsomebody to check credentials.\n\n266\n00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.170\nFor instance, you did your research.\n\n267\n00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:30.130\nYou did your planning.\n\n268\n00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:34.470\nYou know that the manager\nis away on vacation.\n\n269\n00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:35.750\nYou show up.\n\n270\n00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.960\nBut you know the manager's name.\n\n271\n00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.521\nYou say, hey Mr. Jones,\nAbby wants me to come in and\n\n272\n00:15:42.521 --> 00:15:47.460\nreally do a kind of a virus\ncheck on the main servers.\n\n273\n00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.500\nAnd well, Mr. Jones is on vacation.\n\n274\n00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.140\nWe're gonna have to\nre-schedule this whole thing.\n\n275\n00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.150\nSo wait a minute,\nlet's see if we can work it out.\n\n276\n00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.241\nSo they can't call Mr. Jones.\n\n277\n00:15:59.241 --> 00:16:03.884\nThey can't verify,\nthe same thing happened really in that one\n\n278\n00:16:03.884 --> 00:16:07.825\nvideo where They just kind\nof collected some names and\n\n279\n00:16:07.825 --> 00:16:13.450\nhaving those names are helpful coming\nback later because you utilize them.\n\n280\n00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.640\n>> It's funny when I worked in IT, every\nnow and then I have to go out to branch\n\n281\n00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.270\noffices and do maintenance on or\nplace equipment in, networking equipment,\n\n282\n00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.770\nthings of that nature, and\ni would just walk in the building.\n\n283\n00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.630\nThese people have never\nactually seen me before.\n\n284\n00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:30.180\nThey may have talked to me on the phone\nbut, I would just walk into a building and\n\n285\n00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.630\ngo where's your networking equipment?\n\n286\n00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.110\nThey'd go, it's in the back and\nI'd just walk back there.\n\n287\n00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:39.690\nYeah, I'm from the main office, I'm here\nto replace the networking equipment.\n\n288\n00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.370\nOkay, are we going to be down?\n\n289\n00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:44.230\nYeah, you'll be down for a few minutes\nwhile I switch out the equipment and\n\n290\n00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.740\nthen as soon as it's done,\nI'll let you know.\n\n291\n00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.900\nI could have been Joe off the street.\n\n292\n00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.500\nThey never asked for any credentials.\n\n293\n00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.620\nThey never had a pre-call\nsaying someone is coming out.\n\n294\n00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:59.550\nI just showed up, and I did have the\nauthority to be there, but if I just acted\n\n295\n00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:01.890\nlike I had the authority to be there,\nthey never would have questioned me.\n\n296\n00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.080\n>> It goes back to our\nterm of assumed knowledge.\n\n297\n00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:08.210\n>> Right.\n>> If it looks like a duck, it must be.\n\n298\n00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.320\nIt looks like an IT van-\n>> It's gotta be,\n\n299\n00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.610\n>> Must be and IT van.\n\n300\n00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:18.830\nThat's a very powerful\nelement that you utilise and\n\n301\n00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:22.880\nreally how many times that\nyou've in to a place where\n\n302\n00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:29.530\nthey did assume that\nyou were supposed to be\n\n303\n00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:35.220\nthere, at the airport,\neasy enough to slip through doors.\n\n304\n00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:40.990\nIf you had on the right clothing or\nthe right elements,\n\n305\n00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.890\nthe right clipboard that,\nthe pen behind the ear.\n\n306\n00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:45.920\n>> The pretext, right?\n\n307\n00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.590\n>> The pretext, yes.\n\n308\n00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:51.910\nSo, being hard to verify is an element,\n\n309\n00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:56.370\nit's part of your probably plan b,\nyour backup plan.\n\n310\n00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:03.800\nI would say have a plan c too and\nplan c is to think with your feet.\n\n311\n00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.200\nYeah.\n>> Move out.\n\n312\n00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.990\n>> I love it when, if someone does try to\nverify you, who did you say you were with?\n\n313\n00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:13.580\nI'm with ADT,\nyou're security company here.\n\n314\n00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.600\nI'm here to check the windows, the doors,\nalso there's something a little weird\n\n315\n00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.210\ngoing on,\nwe just want to verify everything's fine.\n\n316\n00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:21.050\nWhat's your supervisor name?\n\n317\n00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.020\nJust call the main line, you'll get to\ntalk to somebody, and they'll call,\n\n318\n00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.960\nsome people actually call.\n\n319\n00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.500\nI'm talking to a guy at ADT says they\ndon't have any record of you coming out\n\n320\n00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.540\nhere apparently.\n\n321\n00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.230\nLet me talk to him.\n\n322\n00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.980\nBryan, what's going on here?\n\n323\n00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.330\nNo, you see, that's the problem.\n\n324\n00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.680\nThe schedules have gotten all mixed up.\n\n325\n00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.330\nDon't worry about it.\n\n326\n00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:39.440\nI'll take care of this place and\n\n327\n00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.100\nI'll tell the yuck up here to mix\nthings up to get it straight.\n\n328\n00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.060\nYou guys have a good one and hang up.\n\n329\n00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:50.110\nYeah I talked to them, and this guy\ngot fired and now things are haywire.\n\n330\n00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.740\nYou just explain away the fact\nthat you don't belong there,\n\n331\n00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.930\nunless you verify that\nyou don't belong there.\n\n332\n00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.380\n>> There's always that some\n>> What's the address here?\n\n333\n00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.150\n>> Yeah.\n\n334\n00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.000\n>> Yeah I'm in the wrong building,\nin the wrong office okay.\n\n335\n00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:03.550\nDown the hall.\n\n336\n00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:04.480\n>> Plan b right?\n\n337\n00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.630\nThinking on your feet kind of idea.\n\n338\n00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.110\n>> Yeah, exactly, yeah.\n\n339\n00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:12.520\nI think it really there's where\nnaturalist and being relaxed.\n\n340\n00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.490\nI mean don't panic whatever.\n\n341\n00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:19.607\nJust kinda roll with it and\n>> Try to\n\n342\n00:19:19.607 --> 00:19:23.840\nassess people's intelligence to a degree.\n\n343\n00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.390\nYou are going to find some people\nare going to be more difficult\n\n344\n00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.580\nto deal with than to pull\nthe pretext off than others,\n\n345\n00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.930\nand that's really how\nthe con man goes about it.\n\n346\n00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:40.870\nYou know, the con man can read a person,\nhe can read who their\n\n347\n00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:45.660\nsubject's gonna be, who their mark\nwould be, really just through instinct.\n\n348\n00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.790\nDab it, they know the tell, you know?\n\n349\n00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.140\n>> Right.\nThey see it and they know.\n\n350\n00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.660\n>> They see it and they know.\n\n351\n00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.660\nAnd there's not much to be said\nabout having that kind of skill.\n\n352\n00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:59.220\n>> Now can that be taught or\nis that just a natural thing?\n\n353\n00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:06.370\n>> To a degree but I think it's like some\npeople a great at sports, others aren't.\n\n354\n00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.020\nNo matter how much practice,\nyou're never gonna be a superstar.\n\n355\n00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:10.590\n>> That's true.\n\n356\n00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.950\nAnd then you've got your\nLarry Birds Larry Bird always said,\n\n357\n00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:17.860\nI don't have any natural ability,\nthis is all sweat equity.\n\n358\n00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.110\nAnd has some of the greatest\nstats in the NBA.\n\n359\n00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:24.040\n>> So, I would say yeah there\nare obviously exceptions.\n\n360\n00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.520\n>> I think if you can, you might not be a\nnatural but if you can look for patterns.\n\n361\n00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.630\nIf someone can show you what those\npatterns are, that could be taught, right?\n\n362\n00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.786\nHave you [CROSSTALK]\n>> I see all these elements.\n\n363\n00:20:35.786 --> 00:20:40.650\nThe concepts and principals that\nwe're kind of going through will help\n\n364\n00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:45.350\nanyone to a certain degree\nto develop those skills and\n\n365\n00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.470\nabilities to illicit and pretext.\n\n366\n00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:56.330\nSo intelligence is one of those things\nyou got to be able to gauge and\n\n367\n00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.910\nunderstand a person's skill level.\n\n368\n00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:03.570\nWho are you going to get through and\nwho you're not?\n\n369\n00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.020\nYou need to have a in-game.\n\n370\n00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.180\nYou really need to have a goal in mind.\n\n371\n00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.630\nWhat is your target?\n\n372\n00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:16.230\nAre you trying to get into an area,\nare you trying to infiltrate the network?\n\n373\n00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:21.900\nAre you trying to Drop some kind\nof a trojan in the network,\n\n374\n00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.274\nare you trying to get in the video.\n\n375\n00:21:27.968 --> 00:21:33.150\nThe intention was to really\nput in an access point.\n\n376\n00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:38.040\nAnd it's actually some cases what I've\ndone, go in there, drop in an access\n\n377\n00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:43.710\npoint, leave and just come back in a close\narea, I can pick up the signal and\n\n378\n00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:48.580\nthen actually do my scanning and\nmy network reconnaissance at that point.\n\n379\n00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:53.640\nSo, that's a really important part, and\n\n380\n00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:58.270\nagain, I gotta bring about\nthe legal implications.\n\n381\n00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:04.830\nCuz pretexting is more\nserious than solicitation,\n\n382\n00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:11.810\nbecause you are now creating fraud.\n\n383\n00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:16.560\nSo in the context of going back\nto our planning what are we\n\n384\n00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.300\nallowed to do,\nwhat are the areas that we can go in,\n\n385\n00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:28.270\nwhat are the people that we can talk to,\nto what extent can i trust people.\n\n386\n00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:36.110\nIt's very very important that\nyou that written down and\n\n387\n00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:41.610\nsigned of, for you,\neven start doing your research.\n\n388\n00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:47.730\n>> So your contract with your indies is\nreally an important piece of documentation\n\n389\n00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:51.570\nbecause it's going to basically\n>> Give\n\n390\n00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.250\nyou the boundaries in which\nyou are allowed to work in.\n\n391\n00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.540\n>> Sure.\n>> And if you out step those boundaries,\n\n392\n00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:59.010\nwe're talking about\nthings like the HP thing.\n\n393\n00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.160\n>> Yeah.\n>> They went beyond what they were allowed\n\n394\n00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.990\nto do and once you've gone beyond that,\nyou're now in looking at,\n\n395\n00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:07.370\nyou've broken the law.\n\n396\n00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:09.290\n>> And people went to jail.\n\n397\n00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:10.140\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n398\n00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.440\nYeah, people went to jail for it.\n\n399\n00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.370\nSo I can't stress that enough.\n\n400\n00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:15.590\nIt's important.\n>> So be very,\n\n401\n00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:19.530\nvery specific when it\ncomes to your contract.\n\n402\n00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:23.490\nWalk that thing over with a fine tooth\ncomb, know exactly what it is that you're\n\n403\n00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:27.790\nallowed to do, where out of bounds lies,\nso that you don't find yourself out there.\n\n404\n00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:31.750\nI think of things as, especially when it\ncomes to scanning, because I'm I do a lot\n\n405\n00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:36.410\nof traditional types of computer security\nand scanning is a big part of that.\n\n406\n00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:37.990\nWhen you're scanning a system,\n\n407\n00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:41.120\nyou have to scan systems that\nyou've been given permissions to.\n\n408\n00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.680\nYou have to PIN test or social engineer\npeople and systems that you've\n\n409\n00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.750\nbeen given permissions to, and\nif someone says here's my IP range,\n\n410\n00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:53.350\nI need to verify that they didn't give me-\n>> Somebody else's IP range.\n\n411\n00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.360\n>> Somebody else's IP range, right.\n\n412\n00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.399\nI have to do my due diligence.\n\n413\n00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.200\nI find myself in hot water and\nI'd have no recourse.\n\n414\n00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.488\nNo contract on earth is going\nto set before a judge and\n\n415\n00:24:01.488 --> 00:24:02.790\nsay they gave me permission.\n\n416\n00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.551\nWell they gave you permission something\nthey don't have the right to give you\n\n417\n00:24:05.551 --> 00:24:06.155\npermission to.\n\n418\n00:24:06.155 --> 00:24:09.547\nSo you need to do your\ndue diligence as well.\n\n419\n00:24:09.547 --> 00:24:11.125\n>> Yeah, right, exactly yeah.\n\n420\n00:24:11.125 --> 00:24:15.209\nThere you had a signed agreement, but\n\n421\n00:24:15.209 --> 00:24:21.614\nwith fictitious information,\nor improper information.\n\n422\n00:24:21.614 --> 00:24:26.686\nThat would have landed you in some\nhot water, and people have done it.\n\n423\n00:24:26.686 --> 00:24:31.460\nPeople have scanned ranges that\nthey weren't supposed to be.\n\n424\n00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.868\n>> I can write up a document that says,\n\n425\n00:24:33.868 --> 00:24:39.260\nyou're allowed to hack this bank\nsystem and withdraw up to $500,000.\n\n426\n00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.440\nIf I don't have any authority to do that,\nall you have is a piece of paper and\n\n427\n00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.250\nyou've done an illegal act, right?\n\n428\n00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.190\nAll right, so,\nagain do your due diligence,\n\n429\n00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:49.610\nmake sure that you verify the boundaries\nand that everything is on the up and\n\n430\n00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:54.270\nup, and that you are doing the right\nthing, stay well within that system.\n\n431\n00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:56.897\nAll right, what else do we need\nto talk about when it comes to-\n\n432\n00:24:56.897 --> 00:24:57.489\n>> Well,\n\n433\n00:24:57.489 --> 00:25:01.050\nreally fall back to the same methodology.\n\n434\n00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:08.220\nWe need to identify the problem,\nthe goal that's in mind.\n\n435\n00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:12.780\nWe need to question what elements in that\n\n436\n00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:20.120\nparticular job that we're allowed\nto do and not allowed to do.\n\n437\n00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.850\nAnd then,\nwe need to gather information about that.\n\n438\n00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:29.270\nAgain, I can't emphasize how important\nhaving the complete information\n\n439\n00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:33.620\nlike the IP range Is for you.\n\n440\n00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.840\nCertainly and then, what the outcome,\n\n441\n00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:42.362\nwhat the total goal of it is and\nthen when to end that.\n\n442\n00:25:42.362 --> 00:25:46.740\nThere are some situations\nwhere people have\n\n443\n00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.890\nbeen able to schmooze away\nthrough the front door.\n\n444\n00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.920\nBut, they realized that there\nwere locks on the way out.\n\n445\n00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.480\nSo, people get in, can't get out.\n\n446\n00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:06.476\nAnd so, here's where you need\nsome physical lockpicking skills,\n\n447\n00:26:06.476 --> 00:26:11.945\nabilities to bypass mechanisms,\nor be able to have the skills\n\n448\n00:26:11.945 --> 00:26:17.331\nof piggy backing, and tailgating,\nto get out of your area.\n\n449\n00:26:17.331 --> 00:26:20.309\nSo pre-texting can get\nyou into hot water so\n\n450\n00:26:20.309 --> 00:26:24.187\nyou need to have the skills and\nabilities to get out of it.\n\n451\n00:26:26.246 --> 00:26:30.121\nSo in that, I don't know,\n\n452\n00:26:30.121 --> 00:26:36.523\none of my favorite\npretexts is in Bruce Leeâs\n\n453\n00:26:36.523 --> 00:26:41.411\nmovie, The Big Brawl, now, so.\n\n454\n00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:52.028\nIn the film he wants to get in to this\nneighboring Japanese martial art school,\n\n455\n00:26:52.028 --> 00:26:57.075\nand so, to really find out what\ntheir training was like and\n\n456\n00:26:57.075 --> 00:26:59.610\nwho was running the school.\n\n457\n00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:05.447\nAnd so he dresses up as a telephone\nrepair man, and goes into the school.\n\n458\n00:27:05.447 --> 00:27:08.448\nAnd he's, I need to check the phone.\n\n459\n00:27:08.448 --> 00:27:13.726\nAnd he'll take the phone apart, but\nthe cool part about it was the way he just\n\n460\n00:27:13.726 --> 00:27:18.922\nput on the disguise and walked through and\njust played this really humble,\n\n461\n00:27:18.922 --> 00:27:23.896\nsimple guy, going from phone to phone and\ngathering his information.\n\n462\n00:27:23.896 --> 00:27:28.664\nI would loved actually\nto show that one but\n\n463\n00:27:28.664 --> 00:27:36.030\nthe movie was Fist of Fury and\nthat's a fantastic example of it.\n\n464\n00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:39.540\n>> I think I vaguely remember that scene\nwhere he had the whole hard hat and\n\n465\n00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:44.330\nthe blue jump suit and he's, yeah,\nI'm here to fix these telephones.\n\n466\n00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:47.600\nWhole time people are doing their thing\nand not really paying any attention\n\n467\n00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.080\nbecause who pays attention\nto a telephone repair man?\n\n468\n00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.020\nHe's here to fix phones,\ngreat, I got a job to do.\n\n469\n00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.620\nI'm over here doing my work.\n\n470\n00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.020\nI'm doing whatever it is I'm supposed\nto be doing that's here, and\n\n471\n00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.340\nno one pays attention.\n\n472\n00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:04.050\nAnd he's just, basically soaking in\nevery bit of information he can from his\n\n473\n00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:08.120\nsurroundings and then exiting with that\ninformation, and nobody's none the wiser.\n\n474\n00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.085\n>> Nobody's none the wiser, right, yeah.\n\n475\n00:28:12.085 --> 00:28:18.275\nAnother great one was the Sting with\nRobert Redford and Paul Newman.\n\n476\n00:28:18.275 --> 00:28:19.915\n>> I think I saw that one.\n\n477\n00:28:19.915 --> 00:28:24.237\n>> Where the Sting is like a mid 70s film,\nright?\n\n478\n00:28:24.237 --> 00:28:30.960\nBut basically, they create an actual\nfictitious gambling hall and\n\n479\n00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:36.890\nthen draw a kingpin\n\n480\n00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:42.950\nwho they wanted to get revenge\nagainst into this gambling hall and\n\n481\n00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:46.970\nhave him,\nfirst they feed him a couple of races.\n\n482\n00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:52.870\nThey claim that they were able\nto tap into Western Union and\n\n483\n00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:56.720\nthey were getting these\nrace results early, right?\n\n484\n00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:02.580\nSo first they feed them one fictitious\nwin and they give them a payoff.\n\n485\n00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.810\nAnd then they go, all right,\nwe got a great race for you,\n\n486\n00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:10.370\nit's coming up this one, and the guy\ndrops half a million dollars on it.\n\n487\n00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:15.659\nAnd those days that was probably\nequivalent to about $3 million now.\n\n488\n00:29:15.659 --> 00:29:22.610\nBut, they take him for the money and\nset up a beautiful scam,\n\n489\n00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:29.465\nbut the pretexting that was\ninvolved hired an entire crew.\n\n490\n00:29:29.465 --> 00:29:35.898\nThey set the stage,\nthey build the betting room.\n\n491\n00:29:35.898 --> 00:29:40.468\nThey have all the tellers\nworking in there,\n\n492\n00:29:40.468 --> 00:29:46.013\ncreating a super-believable story\n>> I believe they call this the long-con,\n\n493\n00:29:46.013 --> 00:29:47.222\nright, it's the long con.\n\n494\n00:29:47.222 --> 00:29:49.857\n>> Yeah, well in the movies\nthey call it the big con.\n\n495\n00:29:49.857 --> 00:29:50.953\n>> Right, the big con, yeah.\n\n496\n00:29:50.953 --> 00:29:53.423\n>> And\nthey're going through every single detail,\n\n497\n00:29:53.423 --> 00:29:56.968\npriming it up because I know they're\ngonna make a lot of money off of us.\n\n498\n00:29:56.968 --> 00:29:58.993\n>> And he had to find a mentor.\n\n499\n00:29:58.993 --> 00:30:00.741\n>> Yeah.\n>> Somebody who had the big con.\n\n500\n00:30:00.741 --> 00:30:01.594\nYeah, I wanna learn it.\n\n501\n00:30:01.594 --> 00:30:03.577\nNo, I don't wanna do it.\n\n502\n00:30:03.577 --> 00:30:05.120\nI don't wanna get involved.\n\n503\n00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.520\n>> The Oceans series.\n\n504\n00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.260\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n505\n00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.440\n>> Oceans 11, all that.\n\n506\n00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:08.950\n>> Exactly.\n\n507\n00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:10.560\n>> The big long con.\n\n508\n00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.230\nAll these different elements\ncome into play, and\n\n509\n00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.480\nthen we're gonna get this\nend game of all this money.\n\n510\n00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.180\n>> Right, right.\n\n511\n00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:21.729\nAnd it's surprising how many times\nthese types of cons actually go on.\n\n512\n00:30:24.076 --> 00:30:31.310\nYeah, everybody just do a little\nresearch into con men, con jobs.\n\n513\n00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:32.450\n>> Yeah, you'll learn a lot.\n\n514\n00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:33.870\nYou'll learn a lot.\n\n515\n00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:38.920\nOne of my favorites is\npsychic fortunetellers.\n\n516\n00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.270\n>> Yeah, they're great.\n\n517\n00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:42.790\n>> They're great,\nthey do such awesome scams.\n\n518\n00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:49.806\nLike up in New York City,\nthey'll do things like,\n\n519\n00:30:49.806 --> 00:30:53.640\nmaybe a woman is,\n\n520\n00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:59.530\nyou're having problems in\nyour love life aren't you?\n\n521\n00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:02.319\nWell, part of your problem is\nyou're tasked with the money.\n\n522\n00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:07.254\nReally, yeah,\nif you would just take $20,000 and\n\n523\n00:31:07.254 --> 00:31:10.330\nput it here in this little jar here for\nsafe keeping.\n\n524\n00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:13.678\nYou can get it whenever, but okay, and\n\n525\n00:31:13.678 --> 00:31:18.969\nwhen they come back the next\nday that $20,000 is gone.\n\n526\n00:31:18.969 --> 00:31:24.121\nThey say well, No refunds.\n\n527\n00:31:24.121 --> 00:31:25.259\n>> [LAUGH] No refunds.\n\n528\n00:31:25.259 --> 00:31:27.368\n>> No refunds.\n\n529\n00:31:27.368 --> 00:31:34.493\nBut, [CROSSTALK]\nyeah, probably so.\n\n530\n00:31:34.493 --> 00:31:40.733\nWhat I did find is that there are numbers\nof these kinda fortunetellers that,\n\n531\n00:31:40.733 --> 00:31:44.765\nI mean your only recourse\nis either to shoot them or\n\n532\n00:31:44.765 --> 00:31:46.531\ntake them to-\n>> Con them back.\n\n533\n00:31:46.531 --> 00:31:47.660\n>> Con them back.\n\n534\n00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:53.382\nThat's probably what you would do,\n>> That's what I would do, yeah,\n\n535\n00:31:53.382 --> 00:31:55.933\nI'll get my money.\n\n536\n00:31:55.933 --> 00:31:56.541\n>> Con them back [LAUGH].\nSo,\n\n537\n00:31:56.541 --> 00:32:02.660\nthat's pretty much\nthe two favorite movies.\n\n538\n00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.940\nI don't know,\ndo you have any interesting movies that\n\n539\n00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.160\nhave cons in them that-\n>> Man,\n\n540\n00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.640\nthere's a lot of good movies out there.\n\n541\n00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.320\nI would just say any movie about con men.\n\n542\n00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.250\nI think Dana Carvey did a couple, or\n\n543\n00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:19.450\ndid one specifically where he was a con\nman and he was living in someone's house.\n\n544\n00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:21.810\nAnd he fell in love with some girl,\nthe parents own the house or\n\n545\n00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:22.510\nsomething like that.\n\n546\n00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:25.098\nI forget the name of it,\nit was a pretty decent flick.\n\n547\n00:32:25.098 --> 00:32:29.880\nAnything that has to do with con men\nobviously is going to lead to you to\n\n548\n00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:34.610\nseeing, I think the Oceans movies.\n\n549\n00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:36.760\n>> Oceans 11, Oceans 12, and all those.\n\n550\n00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.530\nThat is exactly what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n551\n00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:43.020\nThat is the depiction of doing these.\n\n552\n00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.590\nI also enjoy, and they did a couple\nof times in the show Lie to Me.\n\n553\n00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:49.310\nAnd I know we're going to talk a little\nbit about things that they do in that show\n\n554\n00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.960\nas well.\n\n555\n00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.030\n>> Right.\n>> But they do long cons to get people to\n\n556\n00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:57.710\nshow you their true self,\nto get those reactions out of you.\n\n557\n00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:02.689\nBut yeah, anything with a con man I would\nsuggest to learn pretexting because they\n\n558\n00:33:02.689 --> 00:33:04.648\nare masters at that very thing.\n\n559\n00:33:04.648 --> 00:33:07.770\nTom, is there anything else we need to\nknow before we close the show down?\n\n560\n00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:11.015\n>> No,\nwe've got some stuff on successful and\n\n561\n00:33:11.015 --> 00:33:15.525\nunsuccessful pretexting as\nwe hit the next section.\n\n562\n00:33:15.525 --> 00:33:16.845\nBut I think we're good for now.\n\n563\n00:33:16.845 --> 00:33:21.195\n>> All right, well, thanks for dropping by\ntoday and explaining pretexting to us and\n\n564\n00:33:21.195 --> 00:33:22.075\nour viewer out there.\n\n565\n00:33:22.075 --> 00:33:23.975\nHopefully you guys have\nenjoyed this episode.\n\n566\n00:33:23.975 --> 00:33:27.963\nBut our clock has ticked its last tock for\nthis one, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n567\n00:33:27.963 --> 00:33:29.124\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n568\n00:33:29.124 --> 00:33:31.551\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n569\n00:33:31.551 --> 00:33:32.811\n>> And Tom Updegrove.\n\n570\n00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:34.591\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n571\n00:33:34.591 --> 00:33:41.344\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.568 --> 00:00:19.496\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, you know it,\n\n4\n00:00:19.496 --> 00:00:22.020\nwe are continuing on with\nmore social engineering.\n\n5\n00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.050\nAnd joining us back in the studio to give\nus a little insight to the human element\n\n6\n00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.280\nof social engineering, or psychology\nif it were is our good friend, Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.110\nTom Updegrove.\n\n8\n00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.680\nTom, thanks so much for\nrejoining us again today.\n\n9\n00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.940\n>> Thrilled.\n>> And looking\n\n10\n00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.450\nforward to today's contents.\n\n11\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.660\n>> Yeah.\n>> The psychological elements.\n\n12\n00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.290\n>> Yeah, because it all really\nrevolves around the psycho concepts.\n\n13\n00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.460\nYou know,\nit's the psychological principles.\n\n14\n00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.460\nSee?\n\n15\n00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.570\nBut maybe one of the first things\nwe need to understand is, like,\n\n16\n00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.870\nhow does that work?\n\n17\n00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.860\nI mean, why are people so gullible?\n\n18\n00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.444\nWhy do people fall for all these, why do\nyou and I fall for these type things?\n\n19\n00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:10.810\nOne reason is the hierarchical\nstructure of our society.\n\n20\n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.738\nWe tend to think that those at a higher\nup level have more authority and\n\n21\n00:01:17.738 --> 00:01:21.370\nmore clout than we do so\ntherefore we're gonna follow.\n\n22\n00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.900\nYou know, your boss comes in here and\n\n23\n00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.570\nsays hey I want you to do\nfive more episodes today.\n\n24\n00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.000\nI say well,\nyou're giving me the paycheck, okay.\n\n25\n00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.280\nSo we're gonna listen.\n\n26\n00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.820\nWe're gonna listen to those\npeople in higher positions.\n\n27\n00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.060\nBut we think about hierarchy.\n\n28\n00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.646\nI mean, our priests,\nour politicians, our bosses.\n\n29\n00:01:46.646 --> 00:01:53.930\nThese are managers, right, parents, okay.\n\n30\n00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.290\nIn a sense if a kind was a little bit\neven into there's this what they call\n\n31\n00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.670\ntransactional analysis which deals with\na concept of I'm okay, you're okay.\n\n32\n00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.270\nThere are like 4 states I'm okay,\nyou're okay.\n\n33\n00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.955\nI'm okay, you're not.\n\n34\n00:02:09.955 --> 00:02:12.260\n[LAUGH] I'm not okay.\n\n35\n00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.010\nYou're okay.\n\n36\n00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.270\nWe're both messed up.\n\n37\n00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.360\nYou know what I mean?\n\n38\n00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.320\n>> It's the last one.\n\n39\n00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.540\n>> But it really deals with this concept\nof a child, an adult and parent, you know?\n\n40\n00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.640\nAnd the child has all\nthe rules given to him.\n\n41\n00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.880\nThere's a tape recording running all the\ntime of like, look, clean up your room.\n\n42\n00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.030\nWhen you get to the corner,\n\n43\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.319\nmake sure you look both ways to\nmake sure no traffic is coming.\n\n44\n00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.740\nWhere the parent is more the one actually.\n\n45\n00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.410\nYour conscience is always going off\non you, the parents always like,\n\n46\n00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.733\nmake sure you wear clean socks and\n\n47\n00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:54.973\nthat you always have clean underwear\non in case you had an accident.\n\n48\n00:02:54.973 --> 00:02:58.524\n[LAUGH] That's my mother\ntalking as a parent.\n\n49\n00:02:58.524 --> 00:03:02.920\nThe adult actually tries\nto balance those two out.\n\n50\n00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.000\nOkay.\nSo the adult is the person who can escape\n\n51\n00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.650\nfrom the box and say hey, as a self\n\n52\n00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.330\ndetermining individual\nI have the ability to\n\n53\n00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.240\nbe self aware you know to see if\nthose rules are correct or not and\n\n54\n00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.510\nthat's an important element I think in\nunderstanding of this gullibility okay cuz\n\n55\n00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.200\nbasically gullibility is\na foolish application of trust,\n\n56\n00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.860\ndespite the warning signs and\nred flags that are there.\n\n57\n00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.830\nSo, we were talking a little early about\npretexting, especially about police.\n\n58\n00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:46.820\nSo, you know,\n\n59\n00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.749\nthere's these cases where people\nare pulled over, usually it's a woman.\n\n60\n00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.000\nPulled over by a police officer and the\nnext thing you know they rape you because,\n\n61\n00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.742\nthe guy, has a truck,\nhas a blinking light, has some uniform.\n\n62\n00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:05.520\nHe's got all the components\nof the pretext but\n\n63\n00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.579\nhe's not, he's out for malicious action.\n\n64\n00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.160\nDaniel said, hey!\n\n65\n00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.590\nWatch out my wife.\n\n66\n00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.440\nIf you at any of,\nif you feel that your gut,\n\n67\n00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.540\nthat there's something weird about this,\n\n68\n00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.500\nthen you should just drive\nto the police station.\n\n69\n00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.000\nDon't stop.\n\n70\n00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.510\nAnd it's weird because we've got the one\npull that we should pull over and\n\n71\n00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.580\nobey, right?\n\n72\n00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.120\nAnd we got the other going,\nyou know something?\n\n73\n00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.840\nThis ain't right.\n\n74\n00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.580\nAnd what is that?\n\n75\n00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.920\nOkay, it's those red flags, okay, and\nthat's the adult there going, hey.\n\n76\n00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.560\nSomething, something isn't right.\n\n77\n00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.390\nAnd it's an important,\n\n78\n00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.680\nit's important to understand how\nwe override those red flags.\n\n79\n00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.440\nEven though logically everything says\ndon't do it, you go ahead and do it.\n\n80\n00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.930\nLogically I shouldn't have\nbought that 60-inch TV because\n\n81\n00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.888\nI don't even have a room big enough for\nit.\n\n82\n00:05:03.888 --> 00:05:09.880\nReally, sweet salesman\njust talked me into it.\n\n83\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.480\n>> From what you're saying it seems like\nthe social engineer at this point is\n\n84\n00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.510\ngoing beyond the logical and\ninto the emotional.\n\n85\n00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.490\n>> Into the emotional right, right.\n\n86\n00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.570\n>> And that's how they are overriding\nthe logical side of your brain\n\n87\n00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.980\nis by tapping into some sort of fear.\n\n88\n00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.090\n>> Fear could be an aspect of it.\n\n89\n00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.290\nTypically there's a, the concept\ncalled affect heuristic, you know,\n\n90\n00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.050\nwhich is a shortcut to making a decision.\n\n91\n00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.110\nWhether we are overwhelmed\nwith events in our lives.\n\n92\n00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.740\nYou know, we all have a lot going on,\nI have a lot going on, you know,\n\n93\n00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.445\nyou propose some that we did can we go and\n\n94\n00:05:49.445 --> 00:05:54.640\ndo, lunch like real quick.\n\n95\n00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.770\nYou run out for.\n\n96\n00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.590\nYou know, Tom could you run and\nget lunch for me?\n\n97\n00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.680\nAnd I'll think I really got to see, okay.\n\n98\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.690\nAffect heuristic is a,\nbasically, a shortcut where\n\n99\n00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.130\nyou're not going to think\nthe situation through\n\n100\n00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:17.670\nat all because in many ways\npeople are basically lazy.\n\n101\n00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.250\nSo that's one other reason why\npeople become so gullible and\n\n102\n00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:29.689\nwind up making split, snap decisions\nthat wind themselves into trouble.\n\n103\n00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.870\nMorality could be another element of it,\n\n104\n00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.790\nsimply the principles and\nguidelines that you're taught.\n\n105\n00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.700\nYou know, it's really a moral\nthing to help your fellow man.\n\n106\n00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.500\nIf somebody stops and asks you for\ndirections, say yeah.\n\n107\n00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.850\nYou know, but at the same time they say,\nI haven't eaten all day,\n\n108\n00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.250\ncan I have a dollar?\n\n109\n00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.725\nProbably you won't give it to him but\n\n110\n00:07:03.725 --> 00:07:07.445\nif he says can I have\na dollar because I'm hungry.\n\n111\n00:07:07.445 --> 00:07:09.635\nIf he gives you a reason you might.\n\n112\n00:07:09.635 --> 00:07:10.495\nI don't know.\n\n113\n00:07:10.495 --> 00:07:14.667\nI find that I will give money to people.\n\n114\n00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:15.597\nIf they got a great story.\n\n115\n00:07:16.807 --> 00:07:19.457\nIf they-\n>> They earn the money in your eyes.\n\n116\n00:07:19.457 --> 00:07:21.117\n>> Yeah, basically they earn the money.\n\n117\n00:07:21.117 --> 00:07:27.057\nIf you got a good routine,\nI'll just type to give you something.\n\n118\n00:07:29.057 --> 00:07:36.082\nBut, gullibility really\nis a foolish thing.\n\n119\n00:07:36.082 --> 00:07:44.590\nAnd it kinda goes back to\nnature versus nurture in a way.\n\n120\n00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.730\nAnd there's always an argument there.\n\n121\n00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:53.740\nAre we born with a sense\nof helping people?\n\n122\n00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.613\nOr is it something taught?\n\n123\n00:07:54.613 --> 00:08:00.342\nI think, pretty much,\nI've been taught to try to help people,\n\n124\n00:08:00.342 --> 00:08:02.686\nif somebody needs a hand.\n\n125\n00:08:02.686 --> 00:08:06.553\nBecause, We've all been in\nspots where we needed help.\n\n126\n00:08:06.553 --> 00:08:12.890\nAnd sometimes your car stalls out and\nyou pull over to the side of the road.\n\n127\n00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:17.010\nThere have been a number of times where\npeople just actually pulled over and said,\n\n128\n00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.170\nhey, man, you got a problem?\n\n129\n00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.290\nCan I help you with it?\n\n130\n00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:25.449\nAnd a guy gives you a ride to a gas\nstation, drives you back even.\n\n131\n00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:27.453\nReally that's a strange thing.\n\n132\n00:08:27.453 --> 00:08:28.481\n>> Under no compulsion whatsoever.\n\n133\n00:08:28.481 --> 00:08:31.910\n>> Under no compulsion what so ever, other\nthan that they saw you had a problem.\n\n134\n00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.060\n>> The intrinsic value of helping someone.\n\n135\n00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.250\n>> Right, and at the same time that\nintrinsic value of helping someone works\n\n136\n00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:44.510\nagainst us because, take this really sad\n\n137\n00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:48.310\naffair that's happening in Orlando,\nwith all the shootings.\n\n138\n00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:54.670\nNow the news groups are totally\nalive with the scams going on.\n\n139\n00:08:54.670 --> 00:09:00.190\nEither people that are soliciting for\nmoney for their own benefit, or\n\n140\n00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:05.840\nsoliciting to get somebody to\nclick on their link to go to their\n\n141\n00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.890\nwebsite to infect their machine and then\nhit it with ransom ware, or even deeper.\n\n142\n00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.860\nThere's so\nmany vectors we could do with that.\n\n143\n00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:21.210\n>> It's extremely interesting when I hear\nyou talking about giving these instances.\n\n144\n00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.160\nWhat I'm getting out of it is,\nis it still the hacker mindset,\n\n145\n00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.360\nthe fact that I see a system and\n\n146\n00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.720\nthere's ways in which it's meant to work,\nand ways in which I can make it work.\n\n147\n00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.677\nThen the actor themselves\nuses that knowledge or\n\n148\n00:09:34.677 --> 00:09:39.920\nthat ability to manipulate it for\neither a good, a bad, or a neutral reason.\n\n149\n00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.418\nTypically with things like what you're\ntalking about, they're using it for\n\n150\n00:09:43.418 --> 00:09:45.180\na nefarious reasons.\n\n151\n00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.240\nBut they're saying, here's how people\ntypically react to these types of things.\n\n152\n00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.940\nAnd I'm going to exploit that.\n\n153\n00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.640\nBecause I see it as a pattern.\n\n154\n00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.360\n>> Yes.\nWithout a doubt.\n\n155\n00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.990\n>> And they're just hacking that system.\n\n156\n00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:57.940\nThey're hacking the human element.\n\n157\n00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:03.810\n>> Look, we all want to do the things\nin our lives that are easiest for us.\n\n158\n00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.490\n>> Right.\n>> If it's easy conning people,\n\n159\n00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:07.944\n>> Then- [CROSSTALK] and\n\n160\n00:10:07.944 --> 00:10:10.215\nI can make a good living doing it.\n\n161\n00:10:10.215 --> 00:10:14.610\nAnd, I don't think they have any\nkind of reprecautions for it.\n\n162\n00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:15.960\nI'll continue with it.\n\n163\n00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.872\nIn most cases,\na life of crime leads to jail.\n\n164\n00:10:18.872 --> 00:10:21.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Crime doesn't pay.\n\n165\n00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.603\n>> It pays license plates.\n\n166\n00:10:23.603 --> 00:10:24.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n167\n00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.100\nyou know, in some countries,\nthere's no exports.\n\n168\n00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.820\n>> Right.\n>> The only export really is hacking.\n\n169\n00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.440\nIt's conning people out of money.\n\n170\n00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.940\nThat's how people make a living, and I\ndon't think that situation's gonna change.\n\n171\n00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.770\n>> Yeah, probably not anytime soon.\n\n172\n00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.110\nThat's unfortunate, but\nit is what we live in.\n\n173\n00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.975\n>> Another element is\njust pure exhaustion.\n\n174\n00:10:44.975 --> 00:10:48.728\nI, myself, Mr. Super Aware,\n\n175\n00:10:48.728 --> 00:10:54.010\nLate one night, I'm tired, had a long day,\n\n176\n00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:58.599\nand [SOUND] just kind of closing up shop.\n\n177\n00:10:58.599 --> 00:11:00.300\nAnd I get an email from Microsoft.\n\n178\n00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.570\nA patch update, click it.\n\n179\n00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:10.885\nNo sooner did they did that to turn\nmy machine into a spam server.\n\n180\n00:11:10.885 --> 00:11:12.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just like that.\n\n181\n00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.740\nI'll tell you I learned so much about\nblacklist and how to get off of them.\n\n182\n00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:23.690\nBut Microsoft doesn't give out,\nthey don't send emails.\n\n183\n00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.380\nBut I was tired.\n\n184\n00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.270\nAnd it was kind of like boom.\n\n185\n00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.150\nThere basically was just\nan automatic reaction.\n\n186\n00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.658\n>> It caught you with your guard down.\n\n187\n00:11:33.658 --> 00:11:35.210\n>> It caught me with my guard down.\n\n188\n00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.830\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's a good way to put it.\n\n189\n00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:44.510\nAnd of course there are these\nfixed action patterns.\n\n190\n00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.260\nThere's a book,\nwhich I encourage everybody to research,\n\n191\n00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.140\nby author named Cialdini, called,\n\n192\n00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.980\nwhat the heck.\n\n193\n00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.250\n>> Escaping your mind?\n\n194\n00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:08.470\n>> Yeah, no, it's Cialdini's Influence.\n\n195\n00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.010\n>> Influence.\n>> Influence, and in fact,\n\n196\n00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.219\nit's the name of the title.\n\n197\n00:12:12.219 --> 00:12:17.810\nSo, influence has, we're going to\nkind of hit it in the next chapter,\n\n198\n00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:22.500\nbut influence has one concept\ncalled a fixed action pattern.\n\n199\n00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.090\nSo a fixed action pattern\nwe see in ourselves,\n\n200\n00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:30.820\nsuch as when somebody threw something\nat your eye you would blink.\n\n201\n00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:36.760\nWe have a lot of these but, there\nare others that we're not so aware of.\n\n202\n00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.570\nWe can see them in all kinds\nof animals and creatures.\n\n203\n00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:43.740\nSo one example he gives\nis the mama turkey.\n\n204\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:50.340\nSo the female turkey is actually very\nnurturing to all of its chicks and\n\n205\n00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.760\noffspring.\n\n206\n00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:58.530\nBut they found that the chicks that\n\n207\n00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:03.990\ndidn't make a noise,\nthat didn't cheep cheep.\n\n208\n00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.050\nBy the way that's the sound of a.\n\n209\n00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:06.095\n>> That was a perfect rendition.\n\n210\n00:13:06.095 --> 00:13:08.031\n[SOUND] I was fooled.\n\n211\n00:13:08.031 --> 00:13:11.960\n>> Once you don't make the sound, okay.\n\n212\n00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.348\nDon't seem to get any nurturing.\n\n213\n00:13:14.348 --> 00:13:17.430\nIt's the ones that, constantly,\n\n214\n00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:21.450\nare making noise that the mother\nturkey spends his time to.\n\n215\n00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.450\n>> The squeaky wheel gets\nthe grease in that sense?\n\n216\n00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.600\n>> The squeaky wheel gets the grease.\n\n217\n00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.780\nIt's a really cool concept.\n\n218\n00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.483\nSo they found that even if they took\nthe sound and put the sound in a little\n\n219\n00:13:31.483 --> 00:13:35.770\nstuffed toy, and stuck near the mother\nturkey, that she would still nurture it.\n\n220\n00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:40.510\nSo then they took a stuffed pole cat.\n\n221\n00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.720\nWhich is a natural enemy of the turkey.\n\n222\n00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.470\nThey put the pole cat near the turkey and\n\n223\n00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:52.340\nthe turkey goes,\nI mean turkey could cause some damage, so\n\n224\n00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:57.590\nthey got some tearing talons and stuff.\n\n225\n00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.740\nBut when they put the voice in it,\n\n226\n00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.970\nthey put a little cheep cheep in there,\nIt nurtured the polecat.\n\n227\n00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.870\nTurn it off, it turns it off.\n\n228\n00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.760\nSo it's kind of interesting that\nthe way these kind of fixed actions\n\n229\n00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.200\nare and our awareness, I think,\n\n230\n00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:19.460\nof finding those same fix actions\nin ourselves are really helpful.\n\n231\n00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:24.590\nAnd then it's not to say\nanything about conditioning.\n\n232\n00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.236\nI mean conditioning is a whole other area.\n\n233\n00:14:26.236 --> 00:14:27.290\n>> Right.\n\n234\n00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:31.953\n>> Conditioning in it\nself is an aspect of,\n\n235\n00:14:31.953 --> 00:14:36.479\nwe all know certainly Pavlov's dog and\n\n236\n00:14:36.479 --> 00:14:41.280\nthe whole bit with Pavlov would certainly\n\n237\n00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:46.354\nfeed the dog and\nring a bell at the same time,\n\n238\n00:14:46.354 --> 00:14:51.701\nfeed the dog and\nring the bell, feed the dog and\n\n239\n00:14:51.701 --> 00:14:56.530\nring the bell and then just ring the bell.\n\n240\n00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:03.943\nSo there's a kind of a conditioning period\nyou when you're doing these things,\n\n241\n00:15:03.943 --> 00:15:07.770\nbut there's also an extinction\nperiod more or less.\n\n242\n00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:12.601\nI could create a particular\nconditioning pattern on someone, but\n\n243\n00:15:12.601 --> 00:15:17.360\nif I don't reinforce that,\nthat pattern will tend to fade away.\n\n244\n00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.560\nAfter a while, the person won't respond or\nthe dog wouldn't respond to\n\n245\n00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.810\nthe bell ringing and salivating,\nlooking for its food bowl.\n\n246\n00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.270\n>> We keep using movie references, but\n\n247\n00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.500\nmy mind immediately jumped to\nthe end of A Clockwork Orange.\n\n248\n00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:36.100\nRight, where they had conditioned him to\nphysically respond with revulsion and\n\n249\n00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.740\neven nausea, to violence and\nillegal activities.\n\n250\n00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:45.696\nAnd then he became at the hands of his\nenemies, once they released him and\n\n251\n00:15:45.696 --> 00:15:51.074\nhe was tortured and hurt and after that\nhe reverted back to his original state.\n\n252\n00:15:51.074 --> 00:15:54.898\nSo they remove the element of\nnurturing that condition and\n\n253\n00:15:54.898 --> 00:15:57.401\nthen he reverted to his primal state.\n\n254\n00:15:57.401 --> 00:16:01.055\n>> Sure I mean this goes on\nall kinds of brainwashing.\n\n255\n00:16:01.055 --> 00:16:04.067\nYou know, I mean sometimes there's-\n>> Jim Jones.\n\n256\n00:16:04.067 --> 00:16:07.040\n>> Yeah, Jim Jones, yeah.\n\n257\n00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:13.560\nBut there's also a spontaneous resurgence\nof the stimulus that although it's faded\n\n258\n00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:18.090\nthere's still a memory, and sometimes\na particular response will bring that up.\n\n259\n00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:25.760\nAnd I'm sure that's with all\nthis a particular sad story,\n\n260\n00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:31.410\na happy story, some sound, some visual.\n\n261\n00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:38.100\nThey're going to evoke memories of events,\nwhether they're traumatic or\n\n262\n00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:44.190\nnot and sometimes people go\ncompletely catatonic when it happens.\n\n263\n00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:48.664\nSo again,\nthat's really the skill of the social\n\n264\n00:16:48.664 --> 00:16:53.200\nengineer to be able to understand that.\n\n265\n00:16:53.200 --> 00:17:01.638\nSome examples of conditioning in\nsports is the baseball change-up,\n\n266\n00:17:01.638 --> 00:17:06.071\nand it works both ways, slow pitch,\n\n267\n00:17:06.071 --> 00:17:11.230\nslow pitch, fast pitch, or the inverse.\n\n268\n00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:16.410\nIt can be a fast pitch, fast pitch, slow.\n\n269\n00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.230\nYou know?\n\n270\n00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:23.096\nOr slider,\nyou know what I mean to that change-up and\n\n271\n00:17:23.096 --> 00:17:27.070\nthe pitching coach is always out there,\nyou know, working the signals.\n\n272\n00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:33.360\nReally, they've got every batter pegged.\n\n273\n00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.170\nYou got a pro found each one,\nthey did their research on them.\n\n274\n00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.620\nThey know what they're a sucker for.\n\n275\n00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:43.120\nThey know they're as sucker for\nthe insider, the inside slideball.\n\n276\n00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:49.000\nThis guy, they're always a sucker for the\ncurve, especially if you take it tight and\n\n277\n00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.770\ninside, basketball, soccer,\nthe double fake, you know.\n\n278\n00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:58.670\nI'm going this way, you get the person\nturning, I'm going that way.\n\n279\n00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:04.120\nSame thing happens in boxing, you know,\nlike we talked early, the pump fake.\n\n280\n00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.150\nSo what happens is that you know for\n\n281\n00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.600\nthat the person develops a reactions\nto whatever you're doing.\n\n282\n00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.760\nSo you just feed it to him.\n\n283\n00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.440\nSo in boxing we call it motor set, okay?\n\n284\n00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.080\nSo that person has a particular pattern\nand it might be they might turn or\n\n285\n00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:24.120\nwhatever, and your goal is to get\nthem to go into that motor set.\n\n286\n00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:30.850\nSo for the period of time that they're\nmoving, they can't control themselves, so\n\n287\n00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:37.490\nthat particular action happens,\nsomething we call a set point.\n\n288\n00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:43.070\nA set point would be if I\nhad a gun aimed at somebody,\n\n289\n00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:44.940\nI got the bead on them and they move.\n\n290\n00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.010\nI'm gonna have to now move\nthe gun to the next point.\n\n291\n00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.210\nThey'll move I'd have to move beat again.\n\n292\n00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:55.930\nWell what happens between this set and\nthat set I don't really have any aim.\n\n293\n00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:57.320\nSo as long as you kept moving.\n\n294\n00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.645\nKeep moving, it would take,\n\n295\n00:18:58.645 --> 00:19:02.158\na person would have to keep [CROSSTALK]\n>> They would have to predict where you're\n\n296\n00:19:02.158 --> 00:19:04.780\ngoing, instead of\n>> Right, so again we go back to the same\n\n297\n00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:08.490\nprinciple, keep moving,\nstand still or you're a target.\n\n298\n00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:09.424\nYou're moving or you're not.\n\n299\n00:19:09.424 --> 00:19:11.830\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n300\n00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:16.360\nAlso could just seem really\nan important concept of it.\n\n301\n00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.780\nIn fact there was a really\nfamous experiment\n\n302\n00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:25.350\nback in the 20s,\nthey called that fat Albert.\n\n303\n00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.370\nI was a young kid, I guess-\n>> I remember fat Albert.\n\n304\n00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.690\n>> Yeah.\n\n305\n00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.640\nYeah, so, Albert.\n\n306\n00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.452\nYeah, well it was [CROSSTALK]\nyou know they probably,\n\n307\n00:19:35.452 --> 00:19:39.024\nthat's how they probably came up\nwith with the cartoon, you know.\n\n308\n00:19:39.024 --> 00:19:44.642\nBut this Fat Albert was an experiment\nwhere they took a young boy,\n\n309\n00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:51.090\nlike two years old, and they introduce\nhim to a number of different items.\n\n310\n00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:58.850\nLike stuffed toy, they brought a dog\nin and they brought different animals.\n\n311\n00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:02.760\nOne was especially like a little\nstuffed rabbit, which the kid adored,\n\n312\n00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.410\nthe kid really loved it.\n\n313\n00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:12.140\nBut these sickos in this experiment\nwhen the kid picked up the rat\n\n314\n00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:17.240\nthe next time,\nthey clanged a really loud metal bar,\n\n315\n00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:22.900\nwhich made a loud shocking sound,\nwhich Freaked the kid out\n\n316\n00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:28.200\nand every time he went to pick\nup the rat they'd bang the bar.\n\n317\n00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.730\nAnd eventually\n\n318\n00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.100\nall they had to do was present the rat\nthe kid was like no no no no way.\n\n319\n00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:40.870\nBut they found that anything\nthat even resembled the rat.\n\n320\n00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:46.500\nAnything that looked even close in\ncontext to it, the kid freaked out.\n\n321\n00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.610\nWell, the real story is\nwhatever happened to this kid.\n\n322\n00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:53.170\n>> Right.\n>> Did he turn out to be a crazy murderer?\n\n323\n00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.160\nBut it is really kind of\ninteresting the extent.\n\n324\n00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.870\nI mean, there are tremendous studies, and\n\n325\n00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.280\neven today I think people\nare doing some fantastic stuff.\n\n326\n00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.990\nSo really to try to dig\ndeeper into the psychological\n\n327\n00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:08.970\ncomponents of what we're talking about.\n\n328\n00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:13.530\nYou need to get into psychology and\nsociology research.\n\n329\n00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:21.220\nToday, the Internet bounced with\ninformation, then you're on your own.\n\n330\n00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.990\nYou go out there and\nyou practice banging loud noise.\n\n331\n00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:26.500\n>> Yeah.\n>> And see how people are gonna react\n\n332\n00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.060\nto them.\n\n333\n00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:31.408\n>> You could pick some decent books\noff something on human psychology\n\n334\n00:21:31.408 --> 00:21:33.347\n>> In Sociology.\n\n335\n00:21:33.347 --> 00:21:38.800\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, the next is Bios, okay.\n\n336\n00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.400\nA Bios is interesting\nbecause Bios is really\n\n337\n00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.570\nyour tendency toward one way or another\n\n338\n00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:56.320\nBut there is kind of a middle point,\nso there was this,\n\n339\n00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:01.660\nwhat they called a three bucket\nexperiment, where they have a purse in,\n\n340\n00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:06.220\nput your hand in hot water right, and\n\n341\n00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.560\nfeel that,\nthen they have them take this hand and\n\n342\n00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.830\nput it in cold water\n>> Right feel that.\n\n343\n00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.870\nAnd then they come back and\nthen they got temperate water here and\n\n344\n00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:24.810\nyou put both hands in and it creates\nthis crazy different feeling at all.\n\n345\n00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:31.581\nBecause you've got both experiences and\nit kind of blends you into the middle.\n\n346\n00:22:31.581 --> 00:22:33.640\nSo\n>> Perception of things that\n\n347\n00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.570\nare very relevant.\n\n348\n00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.250\nI we can alter and\nchange those conditions,\n\n349\n00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:42.120\ncan we have an impact on a person's mind?\n\n350\n00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.840\nSo I've got an example up here in my\nlaptop if we can pop that up, okay.\n\n351\n00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:51.290\nWe've all seen this, but to you see\ntwo faces or do you see a goblet?\n\n352\n00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:55.080\nAnd can you see them\nboth at the same time?\n\n353\n00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:55.580\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay.\n\n354\n00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.004\nYou know another example is one like this.\n\n355\n00:23:00.703 --> 00:23:01.720\nWhat do you see?\n\n356\n00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:06.710\nDo you see half a face or do you see the,\nyou know, the front nose or\n\n357\n00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:10.650\ndo you see [LAUGH] Which side of it?\n\n358\n00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:12.520\nThis is pretty cool.\n\n359\n00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.770\n>> I love this one,\nbecause if I'm not mistaken,\n\n360\n00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:19.040\nit is the front of a face\nwith a nose turned sideways.\n\n361\n00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:24.760\nAnd then, of course, the profile that's\nbeen given is of that of a human face.\n\n362\n00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.530\nSo that's where the illusion comes in and\nstarts But it does.\n\n363\n00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:28.570\nIt freaks your mind out, right?\n\n364\n00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.360\nYou're looking at this going,\nI don't know, is it the side?\n\n365\n00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.550\nCuz I can totally get that.\n\n366\n00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.140\n>> Is it a frontal look or a side view?\n\n367\n00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.310\n>> Yeah.\n>> I don't know.\n\n368\n00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.370\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n369\n00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:40.400\nOkay.\nAnd then here's another one.\n\n370\n00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.380\n>> Old woman, young woman.\n\n371\n00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:41.970\n>> Old, young.\n\n372\n00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.260\nYeah, exactly.\n\n373\n00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:43.760\nOld, young.\n\n374\n00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.710\nYeah.\nAnd sometimes it maybe hard to\n\n375\n00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:48.210\nsee that woman.\n\n376\n00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:52.586\nIt may take a few seconds\nactually to pick it off.\n\n377\n00:23:52.586 --> 00:23:56.263\nAll right, but if you look down towards\nthe bottom you'll see the mouth of the old\n\n378\n00:23:56.263 --> 00:23:57.359\nwoman and the big nose.\n\n379\n00:23:57.359 --> 00:23:59.264\nBut if you look higher up in the middle.\n\n380\n00:23:59.264 --> 00:24:04.253\nYou'll see the swollen nose,\nyou know, inside of the face.\n\n381\n00:24:04.253 --> 00:24:04.863\n>> Jaw line.\n\n382\n00:24:04.863 --> 00:24:06.520\n>> Yeah.\n\n383\n00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.840\nSo, that's cool.\n\n384\n00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:15.260\nYou know, and there are tons and\ntons of stuff like this, but the Important\n\n385\n00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:20.810\npart is the contrast,\nokay, and biases that.\n\n386\n00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.612\nI mean,\nit's a bias here on which way is it?\n\n387\n00:24:24.612 --> 00:24:29.232\nAre you the type of person to see\nthings as half full or half empty?\n\n388\n00:24:29.232 --> 00:24:31.620\nAre you an optimist or a pessimist, okay?\n\n389\n00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.720\nThere's nothing wrong with either one.\n\n390\n00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.280\nI think they're both important.\n\n391\n00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.790\nAnd again, it's like the child,\nthe parent, and the adult.\n\n392\n00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:44.970\nWe have to learn how to develop\nour own self-awareness.\n\n393\n00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:49.180\n>> Yeah, and part of that comes from just\nunderstanding that we all have our biases.\n\n394\n00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:53.580\nAnd pinpointing where they exist, so\nthat we can either work with them and\n\n395\n00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.110\nutilize them,\nagain being more self-aware, or\n\n396\n00:24:56.110 --> 00:25:00.550\nif they're maybe detrimental\nshoving them off, right?\n\n397\n00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.290\nGetting rid of that type of bias so\n\n398\n00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:07.740\nthat you'll have a more well-rounded\noutlook on what's happening.\n\n399\n00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:11.090\nBecause if you have a bias that makes\nyou see something in a certain way,\n\n400\n00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:17.860\nthat's going to allow the nefarious social\nengineer to find that bias and exploit it.\n\n401\n00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:22.100\nBecause they know, well you act\nthis way to blue-collar workers.\n\n402\n00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:26.010\nBut to someone in a pinstripe suit,\nyou snap to and say, yes sir.\n\n403\n00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.700\nSo I'm gonna come in wearing the pinstripe\nsuit, and you're gonna see nothing but\n\n404\n00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.660\nsomebody of authority, and you're gonna\nact accordingly because of your bias.\n\n405\n00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.960\nAnd so\njust treating everybody the same way.\n\n406\n00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.770\nThey're gonna find those biases,\nand they're gonna exploit that.\n\n407\n00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:44.080\nAnd as pentesters and social engineers,\nwe're gonna do the same thing but so\n\n408\n00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.680\nthat we can expose that to you to say,\n\n409\n00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.070\nhey I've noticed that when I interact\nwith you, anytime I was dressed\n\n410\n00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:53.730\nas a telephone repairman, you ignored me,\nand acted like I wasn't there.\n\n411\n00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:57.530\nBut if I came in, and\nacted with authority, wore an Armani,\n\n412\n00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:58.890\nyou acted a different way.\n\n413\n00:25:58.890 --> 00:25:59.970\n>> Right, right.\n>> And I exploited that.\n\n414\n00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:01.740\nI was able to get information out of you.\n\n415\n00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:02.980\nYeah, it's really important.\n\n416\n00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:07.970\nI think to understand because that's where\nwe go back to these cognitive dissonance\n\n417\n00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.430\nand disparity.\n\n418\n00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.870\nOur dispositions have quite an impact.\n\n419\n00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:16.890\nSo, it's gonna have an impact\non us as social engineers\n\n420\n00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:21.280\nas well as it has\nan impact on the subject.\n\n421\n00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.330\nHow could we utilize that to\nmanipulate the subject, and\n\n422\n00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:30.360\nat the same time how can we\nkeep ourselves free of that?\n\n423\n00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.100\nIt's a very very important area.\n\n424\n00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.850\n>> Well we are gonna have\nto think deep from now.\n\n425\n00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:39.990\nWe are definitely getting in\nthe deeper end of the pool here and\n\n426\n00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:44.310\nthen looking at our clock it is a good\nplace for us to call it a break and\n\n427\n00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.815\nwe'll all reflect internally.\n\n428\n00:26:45.815 --> 00:26:48.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> On ourselves and our biases.\n\n429\n00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:49.430\n>> Right.\n>> Tom, I know you got\n\n430\n00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:52.710\nactually quite a bit more to go to when\nit comes to the psychological element\n\n431\n00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.630\nof social engineering, but like I said,\nour clock is running a little bit low.\n\n432\n00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.260\nCan I count on you for\na Part Two on this one?\n\n433\n00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:58.800\n>> You bet.\n\n434\n00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.860\n>> All right.\nWe look forward to that.\n\n435\n00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:00.570\n>> We would be here.\n\n436\n00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.040\n>> We hope to see you guys there as well.\n\n437\n00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.280\nHopefully you've enjoyed this so far.\n\n438\n00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.950\n>> Right.\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off for\n\n439\n00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:05.570\nITPro TV.\n\n440\n00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:07.373\nI've been your host

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:20.070\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, that's right.\n\n4\n00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.400\nContinuing on with more\nsocial engineering.\n\n5\n00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.370\nAnd joining us back for\na part two on psychological elements\n\n6\n00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.520\nof social engineering is our good friend,\nMr. Tom Updegrove.\n\n7\n00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.080\nTom, welcome back, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.090\nGlad to have you back.\n\n9\n00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:32.640\n>> Thank you, Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.090\n>> I know that you've got\na lot more cool stuff.\n\n11\n00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.000\nWe covered a lot of interesting ground,\n>> It's interesting stuff.\n\n12\n00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.120\nYeah.\n>> In 101, but you've got more.\n\n13\n00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.760\n>> We do have a ton of more concepts,\nprinciples that deal with psychological.\n\n14\n00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.870\nSo the last thing we left of\nwith really was bias, biases.\n\n15\n00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.300\nAnd we all have our\nthings that we like and\n\n16\n00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.060\nthings that we dislikes we\nall have our proclivity.\n\n17\n00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.290\nOne guy might like this football team.\n\n18\n00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.530\nThe other person likes another team.\n\n19\n00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.022\nI have an associate who is a life coach.\n\n20\n00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:15.740\nAnd he works with some impressive clients,\none of which would be Motorola.\n\n21\n00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.190\nYou know the idea really\nthere is to try to get\n\n22\n00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.370\ngroups that are working in a dynamic way.\n\n23\n00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.527\nAnd biases are really one of the areas\nthat he works in in terms of, he's just\n\n24\n00:01:29.527 --> 00:01:35.280\ngetting people to understand how another\ngroup behaves or another person behaves.\n\n25\n00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.110\nAnd to create cohesion and\n\n26\n00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.910\ndynamic atmosphere that they can\nbe cooperating and work together.\n\n27\n00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.950\nThere's a good list of\n50 different biases,\n\n28\n00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.864\nif you kinda just do a little\ninternet check on it.\n\n29\n00:01:52.864 --> 00:01:54.750\nBut a few of them, for\n\n30\n00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.830\ninstance one of my favorites is\nthe ostrich bias or the ostrich\n\n31\n00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.690\neffect where a person doesn't really wanna\npay attention to this particular thing.\n\n32\n00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.810\nAnd it may be their accounting.\n\n33\n00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.330\nMaybe they don't like numbers.\n\n34\n00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.990\nSo when the bank statement comes in,\nit just gets shoved in a drawer here.\n\n35\n00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.190\nI'm not gonna look at that, you know?\n\n36\n00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.300\nIt could be bills, something like that.\n\n37\n00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.750\nPeople may just,\nI'll deal with it when I can.\n\n38\n00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.020\nOf course the ostrich effect,\nhaving your head buried in the sand,\n\n39\n00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.540\nnot seeing what's going on around you,\nyou're gonna miss some things.\n\n40\n00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.590\nOkay?\n>> You're basically refusing to\n\n41\n00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.680\nsee that there's an issue in front of\nyou and if you think If I don't see it,\n\n42\n00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.030\nit's not there\n>> Right right right.\n\n43\n00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.660\n>> Another one that's kind of\ninteresting really is the recency bias.\n\n44\n00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.240\nWe haven't had a hurricane\nhere in a while so therefore,\n\n45\n00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.920\nit's probably not going to happen.\n\n46\n00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.740\nThat's the kind of recency it hasn't\nhappened to me it hasn't happened to\n\n47\n00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.580\nanybody I know I'm not gonna get hacked,\nokay.\n\n48\n00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.090\nGuaranteed it's gonna set you up so that\n\n49\n00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.920\nyou really have to look at contingencies,\nwhat the possibilities are, and\n\n50\n00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.000\nreally kind of get yourself\ninto deeper critical thinking.\n\n51\n00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.190\nSo it brings back that concept I brought\nup earlier, which is the affect heuristic.\n\n52\n00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.470\nWhich is simply our stick\nour head in the sand,\n\n53\n00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.310\nsaying it's not going to happen to me.\n\n54\n00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.630\nAnd really just kinda take the easy paths.\n\n55\n00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.030\nIt's normal and natural to do that.\n\n56\n00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.830\nBecause it cuts down on a kinda\nmental work that we have to do.\n\n57\n00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.020\nAnd I think that going back\nto the initial part of,\n\n58\n00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.010\nwhat we started within the psychological\nprinciple, as to why people are so\n\n59\n00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.510\ngullible, is because people really\ndon't want to put the work into\n\n60\n00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.410\nchecking all those red flags, and\nnot paying attention to their gut.\n\n61\n00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.520\nThe gut instinct about it.\n\n62\n00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.120\nA lot of times the affect heuristic\nis actually called a gut check.\n\n63\n00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.810\nAnd so that's kind of what's going on.\n\n64\n00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.290\nAnd sometimes we're more in\na critical phase thinking.\n\n65\n00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.190\nAnd sometimes we're more\nin kind of a feeling phase.\n\n66\n00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.500\nThat kind of brings down to\nthe type of person you might be.\n\n67\n00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.360\nPeople tend to be in different modes.\n\n68\n00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.240\nFor instance someone may\nbe a more visual person.\n\n69\n00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.980\nYou can tell that when they say,\nI see what you mean.\n\n70\n00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.070\nThey won't be more on the hearing level,\n\n71\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.220\nso they well, sounds good to me.\n\n72\n00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.290\nSo you get a little idea of\njust the way that person works.\n\n73\n00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.180\nAnd you could kind of get a little feeling\nfrom there as well, simply by wording and\n\n74\n00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.419\nphrasing, the type of\nsolicitation that you're doing.\n\n75\n00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.980\nHow's it feel to you is\nthe important thing right?\n\n76\n00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.290\nThat's a tactile person,\na tactile person you might give\n\n77\n00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.823\nthem a boost of confidence\nwith a little touch.\n\n78\n00:05:08.823 --> 00:05:09.522\n>> Little at a boy.\n\n79\n00:05:09.522 --> 00:05:12.200\n>> Yeah.\nOn the other hand you'll find some people\n\n80\n00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.440\nwho are actually going to pull away,\nthey don't like,\n\n81\n00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.910\nthe proximity and\nyou have to respect that.\n\n82\n00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.460\nYou have to understand and\nhave to see that.\n\n83\n00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.530\n>> Now some of that can be learned,\nbecause there are cultures that have an,\n\n84\n00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.170\neither a very touchy type culture or\na very standoffish type culture,\n\n85\n00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.280\nwhere touching is a bit of a taboo.\n\n86\n00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.570\nYou don't do that to people that\nmaybe you're not familial with?\n\n87\n00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.440\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n88\n00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.937\n>> And therefore you can go in to\na situation kind of pre-loading,\n\n89\n00:05:38.937 --> 00:05:43.190\npre-understanding that if\nthey come from this context.\n\n90\n00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.720\nMe hitting them on the floor\nmight be not the best way to go.\n\n91\n00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.400\nOr becoming their best, you know, touchy\nfriend where we're all over each other\n\n92\n00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.000\ncould help endear them and\nengender them to me a whole lot more.\n\n93\n00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.500\n>> That's right.\n\n94\n00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.990\nSo it's easy to bring your\nbiases into a situation.\n\n95\n00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.080\nI'll give you a classic example.\n\n96\n00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.810\nI mean, I see nothing wrong really with\ntapping somebody's foot under the table.\n\n97\n00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.770\nHey, how's that going?\n\n98\n00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.965\nIn Thailand, however, that's a no no.\n\n99\n00:06:11.965 --> 00:06:13.400\n[LAUGH] It's a bad move.\n\n100\n00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.740\nIt's really rude and improper to do,\nto touch somebody's foot.\n\n101\n00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.141\nBut considering the foot,\nyou know it touches the ground so it's,\n\n102\n00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:24.560\nyou're kinda spreading impurities.\n\n103\n00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.550\nSo, it's important again to\ngo back to your research,\n\n104\n00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.430\ngo back to your planning and\nyour information gathering stage\n\n105\n00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.920\nto understand what\nare the cultural implications.\n\n106\n00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.910\nOkay?\nAs well as\n\n107\n00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.700\nwhat's this person's mode of thinking.\n\n108\n00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:49.660\nAre they visual, is it auditory\n\n109\n00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.850\nperception that they take in,\nor is it a feeling.\n\n110\n00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.420\nIs it a sense of feel.\n\n111\n00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.280\nWith kinda of brings us little bit\ninto neurolinguistic programming.\n\n112\n00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.740\nIt's considered a quasi science today.\n\n113\n00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.750\nBut there's still something to it.\n\n114\n00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:15.460\nI wouldn't bet everything on\njust using NLP to achieve my\n\n115\n00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.320\nsocial engineering goals.\n\n116\n00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.700\nBut I would use NLP in this context.\n\n117\n00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.060\nBecause we just talked\nabout this visual phase.\n\n118\n00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.290\nThis auditory phase as well,\nis this feeling phase.\n\n119\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:33.410\nAnd, there's some association\nbetween a way a person looking up\n\n120\n00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:38.620\nand looking right and\nleft, or looking down.\n\n121\n00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.430\nAs if they're in a feeling phase,\na auditorial phase,\n\n122\n00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.140\nthey're trying to remember\nwhat somebody said, or\n\n123\n00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.990\nthey're trying to pick off\nwhat somebody what they saw.\n\n124\n00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.595\nYou know, were a memory of\nwhat they remember seeing.\n\n125\n00:07:54.595 --> 00:07:57.187\nSo people will even look in the right and\nleft,\n\n126\n00:07:57.187 --> 00:07:59.856\ndepending upon if they're\nlooking into that.\n\n127\n00:07:59.856 --> 00:08:04.051\nMaking something up, or if they're\nactually seeing something which is theirs,\n\n128\n00:08:04.051 --> 00:08:06.070\nthat they truly actually experience.\n\n129\n00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.150\nSometimes people confuse the two\nbecause somebody may have told them\n\n130\n00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.365\na story that they actually see.\n\n131\n00:08:14.365 --> 00:08:17.390\nThey told the story so\nwell that it becomes their story.\n\n132\n00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.740\n>> And this can give us false positives,\nfalse negatives,\n\n133\n00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.920\nwe always got to be on the look out for\nthings of that nature, correct?\n\n134\n00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.565\n>> It's a factor.\n\n135\n00:08:24.565 --> 00:08:26.994\n>> Yeah.\n>> Certainly is a factor.\n\n136\n00:08:26.994 --> 00:08:32.030\nSo, the eyes play an important\npart in all the expressions.\n\n137\n00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.710\nCertainly, if a person isn't\nlooking directly at you,\n\n138\n00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.020\nthey're kind of looking away and\nthey won't really face you.\n\n139\n00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:45.970\nProbably means that they\ndon't want to be exposed.\n\n140\n00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.040\nThe eyes being the window of the soul,\n\n141\n00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.120\nthere's a lot the eyes\ncan tell about a person.\n\n142\n00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.600\nSo, it becomes a flag, okay?\n\n143\n00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:05.510\nYeah, that kind of moves us more\ntowards expressions themselves.\n\n144\n00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.660\nThe macro and the micro-expressions, see?\n\n145\n00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:14.230\nNow, micro-expressions is really\nan interesting arena, or interesting area.\n\n146\n00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.400\nBut I don't know if it's\nnecessarily important for\n\n147\n00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.340\nus to be micro-expression experts in\nterms of what we're trying to accomplish.\n\n148\n00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.150\nTypically, somebody's trying\nto hide something, yeah,\n\n149\n00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.760\nbut we're the person that's hiding.\n\n150\n00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.673\nOn the other hand, if you want to\nlearn how to protect yourself,\n\n151\n00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:38.171\ncreate self defense towards someone\nthat's self-engineering you, or\n\n152\n00:09:38.171 --> 00:09:43.610\nsocio-engineering you, then understand\nthat micro-expressions are important.\n\n153\n00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.130\n>> Right, and then this is really\nwhere we're getting to, to be honest,\n\n154\n00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.840\nis that we're trying to help ourselves,\nand\n\n155\n00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:54.580\nyou that's watching to be able to defend\nagainst a social engineering attack.\n\n156\n00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:59.520\nA, by showing you how it's done, all\nthe little fliers that throw up, to say\n\n157\n00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.510\nthis is a social engineering attack,\nthis is how they accomplish these things.\n\n158\n00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:08.200\nThen if someone comes in and\nwe are a little more attuned, to seeing\n\n159\n00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:13.910\ntheir facial expressions maybe aren't\nin line with what they're telling me.\n\n160\n00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.500\nThey won't give me good eye contact,\ntheir body language and\n\n161\n00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.010\nposture is one of a defensive type.\n\n162\n00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.745\nWe kind of play around with that.\n\n163\n00:10:21.745 --> 00:10:24.630\n>> Their voice is cracking,\nthe voice inflection,\n\n164\n00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:29.580\nmaybe they're not saying anything,\nor they're kind of mumbling,\n\n165\n00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.460\nnot turning towards you,\nthe way they're facing.\n\n166\n00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.126\nIf a person happens to have\ntheir legs towards the door,\n\n167\n00:10:38.126 --> 00:10:41.090\nit means they really\nwant to get out of there,\n\n168\n00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:46.170\nversus kind of turned towards the person\nand you're kind of in tuned to them.\n\n169\n00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.480\nSo, all of that really\nplays an important part.\n\n170\n00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:56.406\nBut I think the growth,\nthe major emotions,\n\n171\n00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:59.800\nsurprise, anger, fear.\n\n172\n00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.980\n>> My favorite, contempt.\n\n173\n00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:01.820\n>> Contempt.\n\n174\n00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:02.713\nYeah, I love that one.\n\n175\n00:11:02.713 --> 00:11:05.360\nIt's the unilateral use of the face.\n\n176\n00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.470\nIt typically looks a little\nsomething like this.\n\n177\n00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:09.590\nYou get that.\n\n178\n00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.120\n>> Right, yeah.\n>> You picked that one.\n\n179\n00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.204\nEverybody's seen that face.\n\n180\n00:11:12.204 --> 00:11:12.731\n>> [CROSSTALK] Right.\n\n181\n00:11:12.731 --> 00:11:13.499\nRight.\n\n182\n00:11:13.499 --> 00:11:14.315\nThe smirk.\n\n183\n00:11:14.315 --> 00:11:14.839\nYeah.\n\n184\n00:11:14.839 --> 00:11:16.440\n>> Yeah.\n\n185\n00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.685\n>> So, we got a couple here to\nthrow out and just show you.\n\n186\n00:11:20.685 --> 00:11:25.280\n>> The first of which,\nwe can throw up, okay.\n\n187\n00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.220\nWe all know Joey.\n\n188\n00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:33.650\nAnd the expression,\nthe emotion, surprise, right.\n\n189\n00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.360\nEyes wide open, mouth open.\n\n190\n00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.720\nAnd almost all the examples of\nsurprise are pretty much this way.\n\n191\n00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.910\nEven babies.\n\n192\n00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.330\n>> So, what's the emotion there?\n\n193\n00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.340\nWell, you are just in shock.\n\n194\n00:11:51.238 --> 00:11:59.050\nThe field of emotions can\nrun anywhere from disgust,\n\n195\n00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:08.800\nwhere the mouth tends to,\nlips tend to kinda parse together,\n\n196\n00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:15.640\nupper lip kinda pushes down a bit,\nthe mouth spreads out a bit.\n\n197\n00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:24.190\nAnger, where the eyes become more piercing\nand more looking directly into someone.\n\n198\n00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:29.400\n>> What's interesting is your picture of\nJoey there, he actually did have his eyes\n\n199\n00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.520\nput together, his brows were down showing\nthe anger, as well as the surprise.\n\n200\n00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.512\nHe was surprised and upset about\nwhatever it is he was looking at.\n\n201\n00:12:37.512 --> 00:12:38.563\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I think it's interesting, yeah.\n\n202\n00:12:38.563 --> 00:12:43.776\nSo, variations of the actual expression.\n\n203\n00:12:43.776 --> 00:12:49.580\nNow the surprise in this example,\nthis isn't so surprising, is it?\n\n204\n00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.350\nExcept that the eyes tend\nto be a little more open.\n\n205\n00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:58.620\nContempt, yeah,\nthere we have the little smirky smile.\n\n206\n00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.435\nIt's kind of like an air of confidence,\nactually.\n\n207\n00:13:02.435 --> 00:13:06.606\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Fear.\n\n208\n00:13:06.606 --> 00:13:12.000\nFear, certainly,\nthe eyes are wide open, brows are up.\n\n209\n00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.730\nBecause you want to see what's going on.\n\n210\n00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:22.788\nYou have to really pay attention\nthere to your environment.\n\n211\n00:13:22.788 --> 00:13:23.725\nOkay?\n\n212\n00:13:23.725 --> 00:13:28.851\nSadness certainly,\nhugely, the lip is down,\n\n213\n00:13:28.851 --> 00:13:34.105\ncorners of the lip,\ncheek is kind of depressed,\n\n214\n00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:38.590\nand there's really not so much energy and\n\n215\n00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:42.713\nemotion flowing up towards the eyes.\n\n216\n00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.460\nHere's a little closer-up of fear, right?\n\n217\n00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.980\nSo the eyebrows raised and\npulled together, okay?\n\n218\n00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:58.310\nEven the upper eyelids raised.\n\n219\n00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:03.945\nAnd the lips slightly stretched hardly\nback, you have pulled back to the ears.\n\n220\n00:14:08.593 --> 00:14:11.257\nHere's a slightly different group,\n\n221\n00:14:11.257 --> 00:14:16.768\nwhich I think these are pretty classic\nexamples of all these emotions, okay?\n\n222\n00:14:16.768 --> 00:14:18.100\nFor us as social engineers,\n\n223\n00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:24.000\nI think it's important that we\ncan at least identify with that.\n\n224\n00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.620\nPay attention to it, and\nutilize that in our feedback scheme\n\n225\n00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.675\nbecause it's always a matter\nof you transmit your message,\n\n226\n00:14:34.675 --> 00:14:40.766\nyou wait for the reply, you get\na response, and then you know from there.\n\n227\n00:14:40.766 --> 00:14:44.200\nI am kind of upsetting this person,\nlet me adapt and\n\n228\n00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.040\nchange, let me move in\nto a different field.\n\n229\n00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:55.544\nThe same with your emotions,\nyou want to check your emotions and\n\n230\n00:14:55.544 --> 00:15:03.090\nmake sure that you're not projecting\na fearful or a altogether, too happy.\n\n231\n00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:08.530\nI mean, you certainly wouldn't want to\nwalk into a funeral with a happy smile, so\n\n232\n00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.480\nyou-\n>> A contextual.\n\n233\n00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.220\n>> Contextual.\n\n234\n00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:11.830\n>> Right.\n\n235\n00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:15.080\nWhat's interesting is that on the other\nside of the fence, if you're the person\n\n236\n00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.910\nthat someone is trying to perpetrate\na social engineering attack on a person,\n\n237\n00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:22.790\na person double attack and they walk\nin to you and they're like, hey, yeah.\n\n238\n00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:29.000\nI'm supposed to be working on your\nservice today, or I'm with the repairman.\n\n239\n00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.840\nI'm showing fear.\n\n240\n00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.722\nAnd I say,\nwhy would you be afraid to come in and\n\n241\n00:15:32.722 --> 00:15:34.640\ndo the job that we've hired you to do?\n\n242\n00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.860\nThat should be a red flag.\n\n243\n00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:40.422\nThat might even be sending off gut\nreaction to something's off here,\n\n244\n00:15:40.422 --> 00:15:42.057\nit's not acting right.\n\n245\n00:15:42.057 --> 00:15:45.624\nSo if you are seeing those eyebrows\nput together and raised up,\n\n246\n00:15:45.624 --> 00:15:49.796\nthat's that fear face, and a person\nthat has been hired to do something or\n\n247\n00:15:49.796 --> 00:15:54.197\nshould legitimately be doing that\nnormally won't be showing signs of fear.\n\n248\n00:15:54.197 --> 00:15:58.468\nNow, they can be afraid of something else,\nthey got something else on their mind and\n\n249\n00:15:58.468 --> 00:16:01.056\nit's affecting their Their\nfacial reaction, but\n\n250\n00:16:01.056 --> 00:16:03.521\nit should be showing some\nsort of red flag for us,\n\n251\n00:16:03.521 --> 00:16:07.793\nas the person that's someone's trying to\nsocially engineer that, their words and\n\n252\n00:16:07.793 --> 00:16:11.960\ntheir expression aren't really jiving,\nsomething might be up.\n\n253\n00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.250\n>> Right, so for instance the person\nmight be going, yeah you know,\n\n254\n00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:20.226\nand we hang up there, yeah really,\nI really liked that person.\n\n255\n00:16:20.226 --> 00:16:26.091\nThey're so appealing.\n\n256\n00:16:26.091 --> 00:16:30.500\nJust their mannerism,\nthey're always accommodating.\n\n257\n00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.600\nAnd you can see the fists\nclenching at the same time, so\n\n258\n00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:40.320\nsometimes there's the contradictory\nof voice and facial expressions, but\n\n259\n00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:46.100\nthe hands are really telling\nthe story of what's going on.\n\n260\n00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:52.180\nSo, we really need to take an account\nof the entire personality,\n\n261\n00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:56.639\nthe entire person's\nexpression to know better.\n\n262\n00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:04.350\nNow sometimes though we will get a general\n\n263\n00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:10.140\nfacial expression or physical expression,\nbut it maybe simulated.\n\n264\n00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:16.090\nSo the person maybe smiling,\nbut it's a fake smile.\n\n265\n00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:20.730\nSo, usually the real smile\nis the mouth is open, right,\n\n266\n00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:24.110\nteeth are showing and the eyes are lit up.\n\n267\n00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.260\nSo, the eyes are really\nan important part of that.\n\n268\n00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.990\n>> Yeah, I've always heard them say,\nthe eyes are smiling as well, right?\n\n269\n00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.600\nIf you get the.\n\n270\n00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.750\n>> And there are smiling eyes,\nyeah, right.\n\n271\n00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.820\n>> You get the right, that's a smile.\n\n272\n00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:36.630\nThat's what I do.\n\n273\n00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.590\nIt's almost a smirk.\n\n274\n00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.190\nWhen someone says, let's take a picture.\n\n275\n00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.380\n>> Yeah,\nyou know it's pretty close to contempt.\n\n276\n00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:47.525\nSo the person is smiling but\nthey are like, I can't stand you.\n\n277\n00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:49.660\n>> [LAUGH] Or just the put on, right?\n\n278\n00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:53.150\nThe put on smile is what we\nare talking about, where you are just.\n\n279\n00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.930\n>> And there's a smile.\n\n280\n00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:57.580\n>> There's no one side of the face\nkinda like yeah there's your smile.\n\n281\n00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.210\nThat does happen.\n\n282\n00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.740\nBut just a hey smile for\nthe camera kind of smile.\n\n283\n00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.280\nBut when you're really smiling,\n\n284\n00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.950\nyou typically have your\neyes involved with them.\n\n285\n00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:07.940\nYour eyes go up.\n\n286\n00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.030\nYou're like so happy to be here, right?\n\n287\n00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:14.130\nThe eyes actually smile along with\nthe mouth so, you don't see that, like you\n\n288\n00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:19.440\nwere talking about that contradiction in,\nwhy does he just, just his mouth.\n\n289\n00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.040\n>> It maybe a neutralized expression,\n\n290\n00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:27.810\nthat there's an underlying expression that\nis actually very, very hard to detect.\n\n291\n00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.900\nInteresting thing is,\ntake something like deceit.\n\n292\n00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:34.090\nThere's no expression for it,\nthere's no emotion for deceit,\n\n293\n00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:38.570\nso It's really hard to\ntell if somebody's lying.\n\n294\n00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:39.830\nMost people can't tell.\n\n295\n00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.280\nSome people who have been trained.\n\n296\n00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.880\nA real big expert in this\narea is Pamela Myers.\n\n297\n00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.200\nShe's done some great.\n\n298\n00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:55.580\nProbably one of the,\nTechno Experts and Lie To Me,\n\n299\n00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:00.870\nbut Lie To Me is a TV series,\nif you don't know, that is now off.\n\n300\n00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.060\nIt's available on Netflix.\n\n301\n00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.830\nSo if you want to go through it.\n\n302\n00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:06.470\n>> It's a good show.\n\n303\n00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:12.220\n>> But there's, yeah really, I mean,\nthe whole subject of micro expressions and\n\n304\n00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.490\nhow to tell if people are lying,\nreally exposed there.\n\n305\n00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:16.540\nThe whole show.\n\n306\n00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.910\n>> And of course, Paul Ekman,\nwho they based the show off of.\n\n307\n00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:20.420\n>> Right.\n\n308\n00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.920\n>> He's definitely the foremost expert.\n\n309\n00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.920\n>> The wacko.\n>> Well, yeah.\n\n310\n00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.380\nHe's an interesting character.\n\n311\n00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.526\n>> Yeah.\n>> His books are phenomenal,\n\n312\n00:19:27.526 --> 00:19:28.277\nif you haven't read them.\n\n313\n00:19:28.277 --> 00:19:29.063\nJust check them out.\n\n314\n00:19:29.063 --> 00:19:32.570\n>> Exactly.\n\n315\n00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:33.865\nSo, there are masked expressions.\n\n316\n00:19:33.865 --> 00:19:40.690\nThat sometimes the masked\nexpressions are so\n\n317\n00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:50.295\nworn in that they start to form\nthe actual make up of the person's face.\n\n318\n00:19:51.555 --> 00:19:57.175\nYou just see a person's\nbeen sad their whole life,\n\n319\n00:19:57.175 --> 00:20:03.025\nthe lips are gonna drop down and their\ngonna become kind of permanent that way.\n\n320\n00:20:03.025 --> 00:20:08.079\nThere's the whole science\nof body structuring and\n\n321\n00:20:08.079 --> 00:20:13.130\narmoring, that say a kid\nwas beaten as a young kid,\n\n322\n00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:16.410\nhad a really ruthless parent.\n\n323\n00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.800\nKid's going to kind of armor up and\n\n324\n00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.920\nkind of close the body up,\nand never really express.\n\n325\n00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.630\nAnd there's even some thought\nthat that kind of armoring and\n\n326\n00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:34.090\nconstraint and masking of the inner\nemotions has an impact on health,\n\n327\n00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:40.130\nand could be the basis of some\npeople's internal stomach problems.\n\n328\n00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.070\nI mean, we know that certainly\n\n329\n00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:50.790\ndespair and\ngrief can cause people to get ulcers.\n\n330\n00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:58.255\nSo, it's really a very holistic\nsystem that we're kinda dealing with.\n\n331\n00:20:58.255 --> 00:21:01.760\nKind of goes back to when I was talking\nabout very beginning about this\n\n332\n00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.829\nfive elements in the systems of the body.\n\n333\n00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.570\nDon't mistake moods for emotions.\n\n334\n00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:13.400\nSo an emotion generally reflects even!\n\n335\n00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.228\nIn an instant comes up.\n\n336\n00:21:15.228 --> 00:21:20.455\nWhere a mood or something that person\njust as perturbed about life in general.\n\n337\n00:21:20.455 --> 00:21:22.995\nThey're just unhappy.\n\n338\n00:21:22.995 --> 00:21:25.315\n>> Just their disposition is one of dour.\n\n339\n00:21:25.315 --> 00:21:26.335\n>> Exactly.\n\n340\n00:21:30.115 --> 00:21:36.385\nBut again,\nthose macro expressions of anger,\n\n341\n00:21:36.385 --> 00:21:42.497\ndisgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise,\n\n342\n00:21:42.497 --> 00:21:48.312\naggression, hostility, intimidation.\n\n343\n00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.960\nIt usually comes from aggressive person.\n\n344\n00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.910\nI know people that's how\nthey kinda get through life.\n\n345\n00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:00.140\nThey try to intimidate\nthe heck out of everybody and\n\n346\n00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.510\nit works for\na large degree with most people.\n\n347\n00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:04.954\n>> I had a brother who's\nbeen very successful at it.\n\n348\n00:22:04.954 --> 00:22:06.630\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n349\n00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.050\nwe all know, we all know somebody.\n\n350\n00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.020\n>> Yeah, we all know a guy like that.\n\n351\n00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.720\n>> Who utilizes the aggression.\n\n352\n00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:19.720\nSo, I mean, some of the uses really are,\nlike you said, the contradictions for\n\n353\n00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.630\ninstance, body positioning and\ndistancing language.\n\n354\n00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:27.378\nA person that tending to be\nstanding back a little more,\n\n355\n00:22:27.378 --> 00:22:30.662\ncertainly show that they\ndon't want to engage.\n\n356\n00:22:30.662 --> 00:22:35.220\nYou can find somebody that's off in\nthe corner, that, is he engaging?\n\n357\n00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:41.697\nAnd at the same time that person might\nbe a person that kind of move in onto,\n\n358\n00:22:41.697 --> 00:22:47.720\njust get some information about\nthe company you're dealing with.\n\n359\n00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:52.730\nThey're probably more than\nhappy to talk to somebody.\n\n360\n00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.220\n>> Yeah.\n>> By themselves they're kinda withdrawn.\n\n361\n00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:55.720\n>> Yeah.\n\n362\n00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:00.011\n>> Might have the keys to the kingdom.\n\n363\n00:23:00.011 --> 00:23:01.422\n>> You never know who knows what.\n\n364\n00:23:01.422 --> 00:23:04.110\n>> You never know who knows what,\nthat's why I say, the of the janitor.\n\n365\n00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:08.646\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> But yet they know the coming and\n\n366\n00:23:08.646 --> 00:23:10.050\ngoings of everybody.\n\n367\n00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:13.970\nThe bellhop or the doorman.\n\n368\n00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:16.360\nThe doorman knows everybody\nthat comes in that building.\n\n369\n00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.590\nHe knows what time they come in,\nwhere they go.\n\n370\n00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:19.360\n>> What they brought.\n\n371\n00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.810\n>> What they brought, yeah exactly.\n\n372\n00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:21.890\nYeah.\n\n373\n00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.800\nHe's certainly the guy there.\n\n374\n00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.480\nOne of the people that certainly\ndetectives and private eyes are going to\n\n375\n00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:36.680\ngo after and\ntry to draw information out of.\n\n376\n00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.250\nHesitation.\n\n377\n00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:39.284\nHesitation's a factor.\n\n378\n00:23:39.284 --> 00:23:44.451\nIs a person holding back,\nare they not really wanting to,\n\n379\n00:23:44.451 --> 00:23:50.678\neven if you ask them a question,\nlike how long did it take him to reply?\n\n380\n00:23:50.678 --> 00:23:55.527\nI mean, are they thinking up an answer or\nare they've got that actual answer.\n\n381\n00:23:55.527 --> 00:23:58.475\nChanges in behavior.\n\n382\n00:23:58.475 --> 00:24:06.000\nAs a person can become more erratic as\nyou query them and ask them questions.\n\n383\n00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.380\nMaybe they don't belong there.\n\n384\n00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:11.590\nYou could walk into a building, you're\ntalking to somebody, you're going hey\n\n385\n00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.810\nI do really need to use the restroom and\nthis person's like somebody else.\n\n386\n00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.660\nAnd I walked into a hotel recently and\n\n387\n00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.900\nthere's a guy standing right\nat the concierge desk and\n\n388\n00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:31.440\nI start asking him about getting my\nroom key and I'm just stand here, okay?\n\n389\n00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:37.682\nBut he kind of went on so\nyou never know because I\n\n390\n00:24:37.682 --> 00:24:43.776\nassumed that he was\nrunning your show there.\n\n391\n00:24:43.776 --> 00:24:50.376\nAn interesting thing is,\nI said we talked about hand movement but\n\n392\n00:24:50.376 --> 00:24:56.026\nreally self touch and\npeople touch themselves, okay?\n\n393\n00:24:56.026 --> 00:25:00.190\nTo relax themselves but\n\n394\n00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:04.790\nthe positions can give a lot of\ndifferent clues and indicators.\n\n395\n00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:08.400\nFor instance,\nif the hands are back behind the head and\n\n396\n00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:12.130\nthe person sitting in\nthe chair pretty much\n\n397\n00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:17.680\nexpression of I'm in control,\nI got this thing, okay?\n\n398\n00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.040\n>> They're opening up\nthe soft parts of their body.\n\n399\n00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.140\n>> Whereas one hand back of\nthe head is like I'm not sure.\n\n400\n00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:29.080\nYou can see a person kinda scratch\ntheir head, they don't know.\n\n401\n00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.968\nIt's a pretty classic type thing but\n\n402\n00:25:32.968 --> 00:25:38.372\nactually putting the hands\ntogether balances us.\n\n403\n00:25:38.372 --> 00:25:42.240\nIt's one of the reasons people will kinda\nclasp their hands and put them together.\n\n404\n00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.370\nBecause it creates a centering,\nokay, a balance,\n\n405\n00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.884\nbalances the mind the brainwaves\ntend to calm down.\n\n406\n00:25:49.884 --> 00:25:55.350\nBut really, just hand, different places,\n\n407\n00:25:55.350 --> 00:26:00.870\nwill help them to calm down and\n\n408\n00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:05.540\nhelp them to ease their anxiety which\nwe all have at one point or another.\n\n409\n00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.940\n>> Yeah.\nAnd some of the body language books that\n\n410\n00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:12.550\nI've read throughout my time is\nthe Human On Earth I've talked about.\n\n411\n00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:15.652\nHand placement near the groin region,\nright?\n\n412\n00:26:15.652 --> 00:26:19.751\nOne where you have your\nhands clasped together and\n\n413\n00:26:19.751 --> 00:26:26.520\ncovering your groin shows a feeling of\ninadequacy, a feeling of defensiveness.\n\n414\n00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.270\nAnd that's why you're covering your\nsensitive parts, the other is where\n\n415\n00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.620\nyou're actually framing-\n>> Framing, right, yeah-\n\n416\n00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:33.460\n>> With your hands,\n\n417\n00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.060\nkind of down in your pockets\n>> Yeah,\n\n418\n00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.690\nhands, thumb over,\npointing towards your genitals.\n\n419\n00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.892\n>> Pointing towards your groin area,\nwhich shows confidence.\n\n420\n00:26:39.892 --> 00:26:46.910\n>> Shows confidence,\nwell there was one example where a guy's\n\n421\n00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:51.170\ntalking to a woman and his hands are out\nthere, kind of like talking this way.\n\n422\n00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:55.290\nAs if he was actually kind\nof grabbing her breasts.\n\n423\n00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.920\nWhereas, when they changed the clothing,\nhe didn't do it at all.\n\n424\n00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.750\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n425\n00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:02.350\n>> So we should watch ourselves-\n>> Yeah.\n\n426\n00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:05.460\n>> When we actually use our manners and\nour behaviors, okay?\n\n427\n00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:12.590\nBut self touching actually is important\nwe'll reveal a lot of clues about\n\n428\n00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:17.910\nwho we are and what our intentions are,\n\n429\n00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.470\nimportant stuff to pay attention to.\n\n430\n00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:26.870\nThere's some great stuff out\nthere in fact I'm gonna include\n\n431\n00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:32.800\na PDF on really is called\nthe encyclopedia of body motion,\n\n432\n00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:38.390\nwhich these guys have collected\njust clue after clue after clue.\n\n433\n00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:43.150\nAlmost what they considered to be\n\n434\n00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.770\nimprinted actions and behaviors-\n>> Like a universal-\n\n435\n00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:50.710\n>> That run across the universe,\n\n436\n00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.320\nthey run across all cultures and\n\n437\n00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:58.510\nthere are actions that have been with\nus inherent in our DNA since instincts.\n\n438\n00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.760\n>> Thousands of years ago we would do it.\n\n439\n00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:01.710\n>> Exactly, yeah.\n\n440\n00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:02.990\n>> Very cool stuff.\n\n441\n00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.610\nYeah, it's very interesting stuff here,\nTom.\n\n442\n00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.640\nWe're having such a good time, but-\n>> It's cool, this part, I love this part-\n\n443\n00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.420\n>> It is so much fun.\n\n444\n00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:15.060\n>> Yeah, it's actually so much fun,\nreally, because I'm fascinated,\n\n445\n00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.670\nI'm sure you are too, and I'm sure\neverybody out there is fascinated with it.\n\n446\n00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:24.000\nAnd I encourage you to just\ntake a deep dive into it.\n\n447\n00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.510\n>> It is.\n\n448\n00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.100\n>> And like we said, so much, so\nfascinating, and it will lend\n\n449\n00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.990\nvery well for you to be able to understand\nmore about the social engineering aspect.\n\n450\n00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:34.020\nI'm looking at our clock though, and\nunfortunately we've run out of time for\n\n451\n00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.380\nthis episode.\n\n452\n00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.140\nThe good news is we do have\nmore content when it comes to\n\n453\n00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.150\nthese psychological components\nof social engineering.\n\n454\n00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.170\nTom we look forward to seeing you in that\n\n455\n00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:43.780\npart 3,\n>> Excellent.\n\n456\n00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.480\n>> Our little miniseries that we're\nmaking here inside the series.\n\n457\n00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.870\nHopefully we'll see you\nguys there as well.\n\n458\n00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:49.940\nBut as for this one we're\ngonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n459\n00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.383\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n460\n00:28:52.383 --> 00:28:53.462\n>> Tom Updegrove.\n\n461\n00:28:53.462 --> 00:28:54.599\n>> We will

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.297 --> 00:00:18.242\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:22.440\nin today's episode we continue\non with more social engineering.\n\n5\n00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.923\nJoining us back for our part three\non psychological components of\n\n6\n00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:29.230\nsocial engineering,\nour good friend, Mr. Tom Updegrove.\n\n7\n00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.445\nTom, welcome back sir.\n\n8\n00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:31.456\n>> Thank you Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:31.456 --> 00:00:32.674\n>> Such pleasure.\n\n10\n00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:33.826\nWe had little bit more to go,\n\n11\n00:00:33.826 --> 00:00:36.621\nwe weren't not quite done, so\nyou're gonna take us off from there.\n\n12\n00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:41.770\n>> So we kinda really talking a bit\nabout self touch at that point.\n\n13\n00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.841\nI talked about the hand behind the head,\nbut really,\n\n14\n00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:48.930\neven the movement of the adam's apple.\n\n15\n00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.151\nPeople tend to get a little tight and\nuncomfortable, and you'll find them kind\n\n16\n00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:57.000\nof swallowing, and the adam's apple\nwill be kind of moving up and down.\n\n17\n00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.250\nBut another one is looming and crouching.\n\n18\n00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:11.680\nLooming is when people are feeling\nsuperior, and that creates standing over.\n\n19\n00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.618\nAnd crouching, certainly, is somebody\nwho tends to be somewhat submissive.\n\n20\n00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:22.910\nAnd chew on this and really kind\nof think about and your approach.\n\n21\n00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.510\nCertainly the interrogator\nis going to loom, and\n\n22\n00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.770\ncertainly the subject's\ngoing to be crouching.\n\n23\n00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.933\nBut some other aspects of it,\nHow about the supervisor say,\n\n24\n00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:45.777\nmassaging his lower lip with his left\nhand as he raises his hand to speak,\n\n25\n00:01:45.777 --> 00:01:49.990\nor the person biting their lip even.\n\n26\n00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:57.080\nThey may have something to say, but at\nthe same time they're inhibited to do it.\n\n27\n00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.184\nThey're being tight lipped.\n\n28\n00:02:00.184 --> 00:02:05.185\nHow about, A CEO or\n\n29\n00:02:05.185 --> 00:02:08.707\nsomebody in a higher up\ngetting reprimanded,\n\n30\n00:02:08.707 --> 00:02:12.060\nbecause their financial reports were out.\n\n31\n00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.240\nThey're gonna bow their head and\ncertainly sometimes the bowing of the head\n\n32\n00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.850\nis an important element to show, certainly\nit goes back to the looming and crouching,\n\n33\n00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.130\nto the not only the Asian,\nbut even Prussian bowing.\n\n34\n00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.370\nSo the bow is really a kind\nof lowering myself, for\n\n35\n00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.410\nmaking myself smaller to your bigness.\n\n36\n00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.900\n>> So it's submission?\n\n37\n00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.600\n>> It's a form of submission, or\n\n38\n00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.750\nat least a form of showing,\nthis is my place in this role.\n\n39\n00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.791\n>> So this can change depending\non the context, you might go-\n\n40\n00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:49.543\n>> You might go higher on the hierarchy,\n\n41\n00:02:49.543 --> 00:02:50.099\nof course.\n\n42\n00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.004\n>> Yeah you might go from being, well I'm\nsubmissive in this because my boss is\n\n43\n00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:57.726\nyelling at me, and then because my\nteam didn't get something done, and\n\n44\n00:02:57.726 --> 00:03:01.527\nthen when I go away from there and I go\nto my team, all of a sudden I take the-\n\n45\n00:03:01.527 --> 00:03:02.784\n>> Take the leadership-\n\n46\n00:03:02.784 --> 00:03:03.908\n>> Right, the leadership role, and\n\n47\n00:03:03.908 --> 00:03:04.770\nthey become submissive.\n\n48\n00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.820\n>> Yeah, yeah, exactly.\n\n49\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.320\nOr you go home and\nyou've gotta be the parent.\n\n50\n00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.307\n>> Yeah that's fun.\n\n51\n00:03:10.307 --> 00:03:12.133\n[LAUGH]\n>> It is fun, it is fun.\n\n52\n00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:14.320\n>> I think there's the greatest\ngift in the world being a parent.\n\n53\n00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.089\n>> I agree.\n\n54\n00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:19.993\n>> I learn more from my kids I\nthink than anything in life.\n\n55\n00:03:19.993 --> 00:03:24.977\nJust, A, I've seen the tricks before,\n\n56\n00:03:24.977 --> 00:03:28.110\nso I get a replay of the kind\nof tricks that are done?\n\n57\n00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.200\nBut just watching somebody grow.\n\n58\n00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.896\nYeah, it's amazing.\n\n59\n00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:42.630\nSo, our next area really is rapport.\n\n60\n00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.590\nAnd so rapport is actually pretty big\npart of the psychological concept.\n\n61\n00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.823\nAnd to develop rapport requires a blending\n\n62\n00:03:53.823 --> 00:03:58.920\nof all the elements we've talked about.\n\n63\n00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.024\nA blending of posture,\na blending of breath, you can learn to\n\n64\n00:04:04.024 --> 00:04:09.034\nmirror your movements when\nyou're dealing with a subject,\n\n65\n00:04:09.034 --> 00:04:13.746\na person, a mirroring of the posture,\njust positions,\n\n66\n00:04:13.746 --> 00:04:20.060\nsitting the same way or facing them\nrather than sitting kind of facing away.\n\n67\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.311\nSo the ability to develop\nrapport can make or\n\n68\n00:04:28.311 --> 00:04:34.673\nbreak your interaction with that person.\n\n69\n00:04:34.673 --> 00:04:42.400\nOne of the experts of rapport is Dr.\nErickson.\n\n70\n00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.590\nThey say he could put\na person actually into\n\n71\n00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.290\na state of hypnosis almost,\nsimply by his storytelling abilities.\n\n72\n00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:02.370\nHis ability to match breath,\nmatch tempo, match tone, match posture.\n\n73\n00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.030\nAnd so\nhe was extremely effective at helping\n\n74\n00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.650\npeople that had severe mental problems,\nand\n\n75\n00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.497\nall these techniques that we're doing\nas social engineers, you're gonna find,\n\n76\n00:05:17.497 --> 00:05:22.270\nyou wanna understand a little bit\nmore about it, talk to therapists.\n\n77\n00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.450\nTalk to a therapist and\nsee their approach.\n\n78\n00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.250\nI mean, a therapist is going to go,\nwell how did you feel about that?\n\n79\n00:05:30.602 --> 00:05:35.870\nThey're gonna get you talking, they're\ntypically not going to pass judgement or\n\n80\n00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.120\ncriticism of what you're doing.\n\n81\n00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.241\nThey're simply gonna let you talk\non about what you're feeling,\n\n82\n00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:46.080\nwhat you're thinking, what you're seeing.\n\n83\n00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.520\nProbably find the mode of\ninteraction that you best deal with,\n\n84\n00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.890\nand then work that way.\n\n85\n00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.939\nSo going back to those modes of being,\n\n86\n00:05:54.939 --> 00:06:00.954\nit's important if you're going to\ncreate rapport, to be able to do that.\n\n87\n00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:09.308\nSo, like I said,\nsome methods will be mirroring, okay?\n\n88\n00:06:09.308 --> 00:06:14.550\nAnother is reciprocity, and\nreciprocity, the giving of gifts,\n\n89\n00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.300\nand we're gonna hit this as we\nhit our next section as well,\n\n90\n00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.080\nas we talk about influence.\n\n91\n00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:28.044\nBut the giving of gifts actually turns\non another instinct that we have,\n\n92\n00:06:28.044 --> 00:06:32.930\nwhich you've probably learned,\nof reciprocating.\n\n93\n00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.140\nHey, you give me something,\nI'll give you something back.\n\n94\n00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.000\nSo, it's a great way of at\nleast establishing some\n\n95\n00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.490\nconnection there between the two of you,\nokay.\n\n96\n00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.280\nTake that one case of the bank exploit\nwhere all the jewels were ripped off,\n\n97\n00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.330\nit started with a box of chocolates, okay.\n\n98\n00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.010\nOne simple gift, he was an expert\nin developing rapport, was able to\n\n99\n00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:04.080\nwalk away with 20 billion pounds in gems.\n\n100\n00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.883\n>> Yeah, the big score, right?\n\n101\n00:07:05.883 --> 00:07:10.239\nAnd I think of, I can't remember who\nit was specifically, but I guess that's\n\n102\n00:07:10.239 --> 00:07:14.729\nregardless, is that there was a debater,\na person that was very good at debate.\n\n103\n00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:18.888\nMaybe it was Ben Franklin or the 16th\npresident, I can't remember, Abe Lincoln,\n\n104\n00:07:18.888 --> 00:07:20.210\nright, Abe Lincoln.\n\n105\n00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.670\nThat they would, hey,\ncan you give me a glass of water?\n\n106\n00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:24.730\nOr they would give you a glass of water.\n\n107\n00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.160\nThey would give something to you or\nhave them give something back to them.\n\n108\n00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.860\nSo that built that rapport, and during\ntheir debates, their opponents would be\n\n109\n00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:37.230\nless likely to attempt to trounce them and\nbe more amiable and\n\n110\n00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:43.400\nmore amicable when it came to\ngiving ground on their argument.\n\n111\n00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.512\nAnd it was a very effective technique.\n\n112\n00:07:45.512 --> 00:07:48.136\nAnd of course, everybody thought,\nwell, you obviously won that debate,\n\n113\n00:07:48.136 --> 00:07:51.080\nbecause they would give up ground,\nand you didn't have to give up none.\n\n114\n00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.986\nYou're a better debater, so\ntherefore you must have won the argument.\n\n115\n00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:56.630\n>> Yeah,\nis not an arbitrator a social engineer?\n\n116\n00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.790\n>> Yes.\n>> In fact, in my studies I\n\n117\n00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:05.320\nconsulted with arbitrators try\nto understand their techniques,\n\n118\n00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:10.070\nand how they come to\na commonality with both parties.\n\n119\n00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:16.020\nGift giving is so huge in our society or\nculture, Christmas,\n\n120\n00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:22.170\nand answers the thing is not only\nour society, but it's universal.\n\n121\n00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.440\nEvery culture gives gifts.\n\n122\n00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.193\n>> Right, and it has some sort\nof culture of gift giving.\n\n123\n00:08:26.193 --> 00:08:29.169\n>> Some have it in different aspects or\n\n124\n00:08:29.169 --> 00:08:34.724\ndifferent ways that they'll apply it,\ndifferent times of year,\n\n125\n00:08:34.724 --> 00:08:40.390\nbut yeah, it's an important\nelement in our socialization.\n\n126\n00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:45.230\nThe other thing is that another\naspect would be commonality.\n\n127\n00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:53.780\nSo a way that we can\n\n128\n00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.710\nfind ourselves on a level playing field,\nor find ourselves in the same level.\n\n129\n00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.990\nYou'll find that most people that\nare effective in dealing with people,\n\n130\n00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.020\ngenerally don't put themselves above or\nbelow.\n\n131\n00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:13.540\nAnd they said actually, that was\none of the traits of Ronald Reagan.\n\n132\n00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:19.110\nReagan was really super\neffective at putting\n\n133\n00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.140\nhimself in the same level as\nthe person he was dealing with.\n\n134\n00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.790\nEven though he was president,\na famous actor, okay, and\n\n135\n00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:30.740\nalthough that you may strike some\nsimilarities between Reagan and\n\n136\n00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.050\nDonald Trump,\nI don't know if that similarity is there.\n\n137\n00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:34.580\nI don't know.\n\n138\n00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.073\n>> I know a lot of people do try to make\nthat connection, including Trump, himself.\n\n139\n00:09:38.073 --> 00:09:39.447\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's a joke, yeah.\n\n140\n00:09:39.447 --> 00:09:40.340\n>> I would disagree.\n\n141\n00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.700\n[LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n142\n00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.430\ncommonality is certainly a technique.\n\n143\n00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.500\nOne of the things, though,\n\n144\n00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:52.335\nthat we are working with people is the\nresponse that you're getting back, right?\n\n145\n00:09:52.335 --> 00:09:56.855\nSo, sometimes your response attentiveness.\n\n146\n00:09:56.855 --> 00:10:02.675\nIf you are talking, you're giving\na presentation, and you find that\n\n147\n00:10:02.675 --> 00:10:09.150\npeople are kind of tapping their fingers,\ntapping their feet, you\n\n148\n00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.910\nprobably aren't really grabbing them with\nthe content of what you're talking about.\n\n149\n00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:18.430\nWhereas if you find there's a lack of\nemotion, they're just kinda really\n\n150\n00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:25.170\nzoned in on you, then you know that you're\ncreating, you're developing rapport.\n\n151\n00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.915\nSo the components would be\nabsence of blinking, staring, and\n\n152\n00:10:29.915 --> 00:10:31.532\njust looking at you.\n\n153\n00:10:31.532 --> 00:10:34.453\n>> Yeah.\n>> Sometimes that may take you back.\n\n154\n00:10:34.453 --> 00:10:36.800\n>> Can be a little unsettling.\n>> A little unsettling, but, actually,\n\n155\n00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.775\nyou're on target.\n\n156\n00:10:37.775 --> 00:10:38.633\nYou're doing well.\n\n157\n00:10:38.633 --> 00:10:40.430\n>> You got them right here\nin the palm of your hand.\n\n158\n00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:41.660\n>> If they're looking the other way,\n\n159\n00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.090\nif they're looking at their phone,\nmaybe you don't have them.\n\n160\n00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:51.540\nAs well, almost complete immobility,\njust sitting still.\n\n161\n00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.720\nThat person is enthralled of all\nelements of what rapport is about and\n\n162\n00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:02.363\nalmost, those elements kind of describe\na kind of semi-hypnotic state.\n\n163\n00:11:02.363 --> 00:11:03.944\n>> Yeah.\n\n164\n00:11:03.944 --> 00:11:08.740\n>> All right, so,\nanother concept is brain overload.\n\n165\n00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.760\nOkay so, it's like CPU overload.\n\n166\n00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.382\nYou know how a computer is,\n\n167\n00:11:15.382 --> 00:11:20.860\nthis is really kind of going\ninto the mind as a CPU theory.\n\n168\n00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:26.260\nCertainly the CPU is\nmodeled after our brain.\n\n169\n00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:31.122\nWe haven't come up with a CPU\nthat anyway match the ability and\n\n170\n00:11:31.122 --> 00:11:33.940\neffectiveness of the human brain.\n\n171\n00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:40.531\nBut yet if we look at\nthe processing power of the brain,\n\n172\n00:11:40.531 --> 00:11:45.845\nit's easy enough to overload it, to do it.\n\n173\n00:11:45.845 --> 00:11:48.936\nAnd one of the things that\nI do in martial arts,\n\n174\n00:11:48.936 --> 00:11:52.443\nI'll try to get a person\nthink I'm coming this way.\n\n175\n00:11:52.443 --> 00:11:55.260\nThen I'll show him this move,\nthen I'll show him this move.\n\n176\n00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.608\nI'll throw six or seven baits,\nwhat I call leading\n\n177\n00:11:59.608 --> 00:12:04.520\ncenters at my opponent,\nto get their mind going, okay.\n\n178\n00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.570\nWhat happens is it slows\ntheir thinking down a bit and\n\n179\n00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.310\nmakes them more susceptible\nto the next move.\n\n180\n00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.006\nSo you overload them,\n\n181\n00:12:12.006 --> 00:12:17.098\nat the same time using this in\nterms above information technology,\n\n182\n00:12:17.098 --> 00:12:22.120\nsocial engineering exploit,\nyou're gonna wanna give the test.\n\n183\n00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:27.109\nMaybe you have somebody call\nthe receptionist while you're tying to\n\n184\n00:12:27.109 --> 00:12:29.610\nget something into her computer.\n\n185\n00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.540\nUse a team,\nhave another person distract them.\n\n186\n00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.080\nThat's the way pickpockets work.\n\n187\n00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.282\nOne guy will distract you,\nthe other will grab your stuff.\n\n188\n00:12:38.282 --> 00:12:43.502\nIt's a really helpful one\nto look at in terms of how\n\n189\n00:12:43.502 --> 00:12:49.341\nto keep your cool,\nhow to keep your CPU load at minimum,\n\n190\n00:12:49.341 --> 00:12:53.464\nor how to reduce your anxiety, right?\n\n191\n00:12:56.225 --> 00:12:59.920\nForms of self modification, right?\n\n192\n00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.170\n>> It's funny,\nI've actually used this technique.\n\n193\n00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:06.350\nAnd when I was in college,\nthis girl sat behind me, and I liked her.\n\n194\n00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:08.390\nAnd I thought,\nI wanna mess with her a little bit,\n\n195\n00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:12.350\nright, cuz that's what we do as young men,\nwe mess with our love interest.\n\n196\n00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.610\nAnd she had her purse on top of her desk,\nso I'm asking her,\n\n197\n00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:16.320\nhey do you got a pencil?\n\n198\n00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.080\nYou got this?\nYou got that?\n\n199\n00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.858\nAnd every time I turn, or move, or talk\nto her, I would slowly pull that purse.\n\n200\n00:13:21.858 --> 00:13:23.641\nI would pull it a little more,\nand I'd pull a little more.\n\n201\n00:13:23.641 --> 00:13:27.816\nAnd eventually, I had the purse down,\nI was moving it down with my hand.\n\n202\n00:13:27.816 --> 00:13:29.071\nIt was in my hand.\n\n203\n00:13:29.071 --> 00:13:31.853\nAnd I put it on the floor, and\nI just kicked it underneath my desk and\n\n204\n00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:33.856\nI finally asked her,\nhey you got a stick of gum?\n\n205\n00:13:33.856 --> 00:13:35.235\nCuz I know she kept gum in her purse.\n\n206\n00:13:35.235 --> 00:13:37.860\nAnd she's like, where'd my purse go?\n\n207\n00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.608\nIt was right in front of her on her\ndesk facing it, and she never saw it all\n\n208\n00:13:41.608 --> 00:13:45.800\nthrough the means of just overloading\nher with different, hey you got this?\n\n209\n00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.150\nWhat tomorrow's night,\nwe got homework going on, you wanna study?\n\n210\n00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.620\nJust giving her things that she\nwould just have to process.\n\n211\n00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.560\nSo it took her mind off the fact\nthat her purse was moving.\n\n212\n00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.482\nShe never even noticed it, and\nI was able to successfully, and\n\n213\n00:13:58.482 --> 00:13:59.926\nof course that impressed her.\n\n214\n00:13:59.926 --> 00:14:02.474\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that worked really well in my case.\n\n215\n00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:09.660\n>> Right, well, I think that there\nare some basic assumptions about it.\n\n216\n00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.790\nAgain, the guideline here is research.\n\n217\n00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:26.700\nIt certainly adds to our tool chest of\n\n218\n00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:32.460\nelements that we could utilize,\nin terms of keeping a person distracted.\n\n219\n00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.720\nAnd typically, that's how a magician,\ngoing back to them,\n\n220\n00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:41.510\nis going to be able to distract, simply by\nkeeping your mind involved on one thing,\n\n221\n00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:45.170\nkeeping the pattern going in another,\nand cause that total distraction.\n\n222\n00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:52.256\nSo we're kind of moving in that direction\n\n223\n00:14:52.256 --> 00:14:57.485\ntowards influence, but\nI would just say that,\n\n224\n00:14:57.485 --> 00:15:03.763\nwhether the concept that we're\ndoing is manipulation or\n\n225\n00:15:03.763 --> 00:15:08.790\ninfluence, all depends on your intent.\n\n226\n00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:14.450\nI would say on a scale of good,\nbad, influences,\n\n227\n00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:20.350\ngetting a child to bed on time, maybe\nthrough a bribe or maybe through a threat.\n\n228\n00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:25.600\nOn the other hand, getting somebody to\nhand over their social security number and\n\n229\n00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:32.720\ntheir bank information through trickery,\n\n230\n00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:38.390\nthrough any of these\ninfluencing incentives as well.\n\n231\n00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:44.135\nIn fact, I recently read of\na case where this company was\n\n232\n00:15:44.135 --> 00:15:50.650\nbilking the government for HIV tests\n\n233\n00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.850\nby getting service\npersonnel to take the test.\n\n234\n00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:04.530\nThe test ran a little bit more, but they\nwould be giving away like a $10 gift card,\n\n235\n00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:07.160\nif they would fill out the information and\nhave them take the test.\n\n236\n00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.432\nThey actually never did the test.\n\n237\n00:16:08.432 --> 00:16:14.026\nThey would get the gift card,\nbut then they would turn this in,\n\n238\n00:16:14.026 --> 00:16:20.790\nto the tune of like $3 billion, and\nthis is kind of just a recent action.\n\n239\n00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:25.223\nAnd so sometimes that would\nbe something that would\n\n240\n00:16:25.223 --> 00:16:29.870\nlean more towards\nthe area of manipulation.\n\n241\n00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.370\nManipulation of those people,\nthey were influenced by money, but\n\n242\n00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:38.179\ncertainly ill intent,\nI think, on the part of them.\n\n243\n00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:45.420\nSo the only other thing we have\nleft here really is our incentives.\n\n244\n00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.699\nI mean, how can we influence people,\n\n245\n00:16:49.699 --> 00:16:53.591\nand how can we manipulate people?\n\n246\n00:16:53.591 --> 00:16:58.360\nCertainly, remuneration,\nlike I just gave you that example.\n\n247\n00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:04.911\nA person is offered a chance\nto get a $50 gift card,\n\n248\n00:17:04.911 --> 00:17:10.311\nif you fill out this questionnaire, okay.\n\n249\n00:17:10.311 --> 00:17:14.211\nThis question maybe not be asking for\nyour social security,\n\n250\n00:17:14.211 --> 00:17:19.570\nsome real important information, but\nprobably your e-mail address is in there.\n\n251\n00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:24.894\nYeah, went into some opt-in list,\n\n252\n00:17:24.894 --> 00:17:30.563\nthe next thing you're getting spam for\n\n253\n00:17:30.563 --> 00:17:34.350\nsome real estate course.\n\n254\n00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:40.650\nCoercive, there's coercive manipulation,\nand\n\n255\n00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:45.520\nsometimes that moves to the dark side,\nbecause coercion can also\n\n256\n00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.755\nmove into blackmail game and bribery.\n\n257\n00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:58.370\nSome people certainly would be very\nhappy to give out information for\n\n258\n00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.220\nthe right amount.\n\n259\n00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:04.125\nIn fact, I remember a study where\nthey found that there's this\n\n260\n00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:09.135\nhypnosis trick where they'll put\na person between two chairs.\n\n261\n00:18:09.135 --> 00:18:11.895\nThey'll hypnotize them into being a plank,\nand\n\n262\n00:18:11.895 --> 00:18:15.240\nthen somebody could actually sit on them,\nright?\n\n263\n00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:19.224\nBut they found they were just as\nsuccessful offering them money to do it.\n\n264\n00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:21.490\n>> [LAUGH] That's interesting.\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, it's very interesting.\n\n265\n00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:29.060\nAnd then there's moral and\nethical incentives as well.\n\n266\n00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.490\nIf you do what I say,\nyou're gonna get a better seat in Heaven.\n\n267\n00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:40.284\nWith some people feel right up to it.\n\n268\n00:18:40.284 --> 00:18:41.417\n>> They do that.\n\n269\n00:18:41.417 --> 00:18:45.421\n>> Okay, and I think that pretty\nmuch takes us into our next chapter.\n\n270\n00:18:45.421 --> 00:18:49.440\n>> All right, well, Tom,\nwe've covered the depth and\n\n271\n00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.488\nbreadth of the psychological aspects.\n\n272\n00:18:52.488 --> 00:18:56.501\n>> Should we take a,\njust a review back through it?\n\n273\n00:18:56.501 --> 00:18:57.750\n>> No, no, that'll be fine.\n\n274\n00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:02.848\nI think that we've given our audience\nplenty to chew on at this point.\n\n275\n00:19:02.848 --> 00:19:05.871\nWe got a couple of really good\nepisodes for you to watch when it\n\n276\n00:19:05.871 --> 00:19:09.060\ncomes to the psychological\naspect of social engineering.\n\n277\n00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.150\nSo definitely do that because,\nI'm joking when I say,\n\n278\n00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.270\nwe've covered the depth and breadth.\n\n279\n00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.200\nWe have yet to scratch,\nreally, the surface.\n\n280\n00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.429\nWe're giving you the-\n>> The psychological components.\n\n281\n00:19:18.429 --> 00:19:20.817\n>> The, the very quick and dirty-\n>> Concepts and principles.\n\n282\n00:19:20.817 --> 00:19:21.530\n>> That's right.\n\n283\n00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:25.180\nJust to get you started, and then you\ncan take that from there, and go on and\n\n284\n00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:25.700\nlearn more.\n\n285\n00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.580\nThere's a whole lot that's\nobviously a deep field.\n\n286\n00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.120\nWith that being said, we'll go ahead and\nclose this show down.\n\n287\n00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.234\nI'll look forward to seeing you\nin the next one that we have.\n\n288\n00:19:33.234 --> 00:19:34.302\n>> Excellent.\n>> When we get into a little\n\n289\n00:19:34.302 --> 00:19:35.951\nmore other topics when it comes to-\n>> Same here.\n\n290\n00:19:35.951 --> 00:19:36.966\n>> Social engineering.\n\n291\n00:19:36.966 --> 00:19:38.631\nTom, thanks for joining us today.\n\n292\n00:19:38.631 --> 00:19:39.442\nAnd we

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:18.324 --> 00:00:21.429\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.286\nwe are continuing on with\nmore social engineering.\n\n5\n00:00:24.286 --> 00:00:27.678\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday is our mentor in that endeavor,\n\n6\n00:00:27.678 --> 00:00:29.413\nour good friend Mr. Tom Updegrove.\n\n7\n00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:31.281\nTom, welcome back sir, so\nglad to have you today.\n\n8\n00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.410\n>> Thank you, happy to be here again.\n\n9\n00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.450\nSo today we're gonna talk about influence.\n\n10\n00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.900\nWe would like to influence everyone\ninto the characteristics and\n\n11\n00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.640\nparameters of what influence is.\n\n12\n00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.409\nBut to better understand influence,\n\n13\n00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.484\nwe need to know about frameworks,\nokay, and framing.\n\n14\n00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:57.417\nIt's a communication theory concept, and\n\n15\n00:00:57.417 --> 00:01:03.823\neven the social engineering\nexperience is a framework.\n\n16\n00:01:03.823 --> 00:01:08.262\nIn fact,\nprobably the first guy to really put that\n\n17\n00:01:08.262 --> 00:01:12.385\nframework together is Christopher Hadnagy,\n\n18\n00:01:12.385 --> 00:01:16.506\nwho has written a book\non social engineering,\n\n19\n00:01:16.506 --> 00:01:21.810\nalso published by Wiley, and\nI encourage you to look at it.\n\n20\n00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.580\nI think there's gonna be\nan update to it coming soon.\n\n21\n00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.083\n>> Awesome.\n>> Just he's making some changes to it,\n\n22\n00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:31.610\nupdating some of the documentation in it.\n\n23\n00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.030\nBut to talk about a framework,\nframeworks really,\n\n24\n00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.850\nit's a schema of\ninterpretation that takes into\n\n25\n00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.390\naccount the knowledge, experience,\n\n26\n00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.500\nthe education of those involved.\n\n27\n00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.360\nAnd sometimes it's best that\nyou can frame something,\n\n28\n00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.800\nsometimes it's even\na metaphor as a framework.\n\n29\n00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.520\nFor instance,\nto go back to the martial art concept.\n\n30\n00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.780\nFor me, a framework with a person\nthat I would be sparring with\n\n31\n00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.520\nis the outline of that person, that\nthe relationship between the two of us,\n\n32\n00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.260\nthe ends of where their body is,\n\n33\n00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.454\nif they're standing sideways or\nwide to me, I mean, where the targets are.\n\n34\n00:02:31.705 --> 00:02:36.205\nAlso it tells me something about the way\nthat my defensive patterns have to be.\n\n35\n00:02:36.205 --> 00:02:39.830\nIf they're throwing the punch way out\nhere, I don't have to really move my hand\n\n36\n00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.230\nout there, I just really have to\nprotect the vital areas of my body.\n\n37\n00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.560\nSo in a sense, we create\na framework between the two of us.\n\n38\n00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.060\nIf it may be multiple opponents,\n\n39\n00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.230\nthen that framework now extends\nout to two or three or four.\n\n40\n00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.221\nThe construct of it changes, the temporal\nspatial parameters of it change,\n\n41\n00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:01.614\nokay, but that's how we look at it.\n\n42\n00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:04.610\nBut then I have experience at that.\n\n43\n00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.064\nMaybe a person who doesn't\nhave the education that\n\n44\n00:03:08.064 --> 00:03:12.636\nI have will look at it in an entirely\ndifferent way and go, my god,\n\n45\n00:03:12.636 --> 00:03:16.192\nand express one of those\nmacro expressions of fear.\n\n46\n00:03:16.192 --> 00:03:18.684\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Fear can be a healthy thing.\n\n47\n00:03:18.684 --> 00:03:22.730\nFear is a teacher.\n\n48\n00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.670\nFear tells us that something could happen,\nthe situation could get out of hand.\n\n49\n00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.867\nIt's best that we heighten\nour awareness and stay away.\n\n50\n00:03:32.867 --> 00:03:38.760\nSo that element is important, so\nthat's what I mean by a metaphor, okay.\n\n51\n00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.201\nIn the same sense, we have stories.\n\n52\n00:03:45.201 --> 00:03:50.287\nOne such story, and as I kinda checked\nthe facts on it, I don't know if\n\n53\n00:03:50.287 --> 00:03:56.082\nthe story is quite right, but it always\nwas a great kinda self-defense story.\n\n54\n00:03:56.082 --> 00:04:01.380\nAnd I'm hoping you can take this story and\nanalogy and apply it to something.\n\n55\n00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.155\nBut I was told it was Abraham Lincoln\nthat was challenged to a duel.\n\n56\n00:04:06.155 --> 00:04:10.003\nAnd because he was challenged,\nhe got to choose the time and place.\n\n57\n00:04:10.003 --> 00:04:16.160\nThe fact is, Lincoln was over 6',\nand his opponent was only 5' 6\".\n\n58\n00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.383\nHe decided to make it in\nthe middle of this lake,\n\n59\n00:04:19.383 --> 00:04:21.891\nthat the bottom of it was about 6'.\n\n60\n00:04:21.891 --> 00:04:25.137\nOf course, Lincoln would be\nable to stand up in it, and\n\n61\n00:04:25.137 --> 00:04:27.263\nhis opponent would be underwater.\n\n62\n00:04:27.263 --> 00:04:30.586\nIt was smart choosing on his part,\nokay, and\n\n63\n00:04:30.586 --> 00:04:35.318\nit tells something about really\nmaybe you don't have to fight.\n\n64\n00:04:35.318 --> 00:04:40.529\nYou just really have to use your head and\nput yourself in the right position.\n\n65\n00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:45.719\nThat's pretty much what I mean\nby using stories and analogies.\n\n66\n00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:50.561\nWe know that Jesus Christ taught\nin parables because people would\n\n67\n00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:52.331\nremember the stories.\n\n68\n00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:53.730\nThey would remember the context of it.\n\n69\n00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:00.800\nThey would understand maybe the story\nof fishes and loaves and that.\n\n70\n00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.455\nEven the analogy of you can give\na person a fish, you'll feed them, but\n\n71\n00:05:05.455 --> 00:05:10.380\nif you teach them how to fish,\nokay, you'll feed them for life.\n\n72\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.397\nSo that kind of analogy sticks, and\n\n73\n00:05:12.397 --> 00:05:15.432\nI think those kinds of things\nreally work well for us.\n\n74\n00:05:15.432 --> 00:05:20.325\n>> Yeah, I've always amused myself\nabout the idea of context for\n\n75\n00:05:20.325 --> 00:05:25.051\nclarity, and that usually\nequals a better understanding.\n\n76\n00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:31.107\nIf you take a brute fact, and\nsay 2 plus 2 is 4, okay, I get that.\n\n77\n00:05:31.107 --> 00:05:33.863\n2 plus 2 is 4, but\nI might not have any concept,\n\n78\n00:05:33.863 --> 00:05:37.752\nI might not have any context of what 2 and\nadding them together means.\n\n79\n00:05:37.752 --> 00:05:41.050\nBut if I say you have two apples, well,\napples are something that most people\n\n80\n00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.708\nhave had an experience with, and\nI get that I have two of them.\n\n81\n00:05:43.708 --> 00:05:46.637\nI give you two more, and\nI look and they have grown.\n\n82\n00:05:46.637 --> 00:05:48.969\nI put them together,\nit comes up to a new sum.\n\n83\n00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:51.672\nNow that that brute fact has some context,\nand\n\n84\n00:05:51.672 --> 00:05:56.589\nI'm able to start to remember it better,\nretain it longer, and use it and apply it,\n\n85\n00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:59.665\nbecause now I understand\nit because of the context.\n\n86\n00:05:59.665 --> 00:06:03.983\nI've always thought about that, and\nparables have been a great way throughout\n\n87\n00:06:03.983 --> 00:06:07.720\nhistory, Jesus obviously being\na great example of someone that used\n\n88\n00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.085\nparables to influence a set of people,\nto get a point across.\n\n89\n00:06:11.085 --> 00:06:16.636\n>> Right, to put it into a context that\nwas relative they could understand,\n\n90\n00:06:16.636 --> 00:06:18.614\nthat was very important.\n\n91\n00:06:18.614 --> 00:06:24.070\nAnd along with that, traditions,\ntradition's very important\n\n92\n00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.440\nin framing people's morality and\npeople's behavior.\n\n93\n00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:36.260\nAnd in keeping certain,\nbeing able to bring across morality and\n\n94\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.954\nreally the behavior that's\nexpected of that group.\n\n95\n00:06:41.954 --> 00:06:45.977\nAnd so that's just one other aspect of it.\n\n96\n00:06:45.977 --> 00:06:50.026\nSlogans, slogans are a way of,\n\n97\n00:06:55.132 --> 00:07:02.810\nSo many different slogans\nthat we certainly could use.\n\n98\n00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.471\nBut catchphrases, the frame and\n\n99\n00:07:05.471 --> 00:07:10.326\nobject with a catchy phrase,\nI think, is an important one.\n\n100\n00:07:10.326 --> 00:07:16.857\nSo for me, I don't know,\n\n101\n00:07:16.857 --> 00:07:20.159\nI get some jingles, I just remember that.\n\n102\n00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:20.968\n>> They stick in your head.\n\n103\n00:07:20.968 --> 00:07:26.009\n>> Yeah, like they probably don't even\nmake King's Wine now, but when you're down\n\n104\n00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:30.851\nand out and wanna have a good time, give\nyour spirits a lift, have a happy time.\n\n105\n00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:38.166\nCost you very little to be feeling mighty\nfine, so go out and get some King's Wine.\n\n106\n00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:38.839\n>> And well sung, sir.\n\n107\n00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:40.100\n>> Thank you, thank you.\n\n108\n00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.801\nYeah, and don't give up the day job,\nis that what you're saying?\n\n109\n00:07:44.801 --> 00:07:48.787\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But slogans do kind of stick with you.\n\n110\n00:07:48.787 --> 00:07:55.038\nCertainly, the framework\nthat the advertiser wants,\n\n111\n00:07:55.038 --> 00:07:57.831\nthey succeed with that,\n\n112\n00:07:57.831 --> 00:08:03.018\nwith either a jingle song or\na A catchy slogan.\n\n113\n00:08:03.018 --> 00:08:07.403\nArtifacts, artifacts are really\nconsidered something that\n\n114\n00:08:07.403 --> 00:08:10.280\nconsists inside of a social framework.\n\n115\n00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:20.610\nSomething of intrinsic value,\ngoing back to religion, again.\n\n116\n00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:23.974\nRelics.\n\n117\n00:08:26.718 --> 00:08:29.000\nThe Shroud of Turin.\n\n118\n00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.750\nThese are things that kind\nof help to keep belief and\n\n119\n00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:37.740\nconsistency within a particular\nframework of religion.\n\n120\n00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:45.031\nSo contrasts, is kind of interesting\n\n121\n00:08:45.031 --> 00:08:50.414\nbecause sometimes we can use contrasts to\n\n122\n00:08:50.414 --> 00:08:56.434\ndescribe an object in\nterms of what it isn't.\n\n123\n00:08:56.434 --> 00:09:02.320\nFor instance, what is black?\n\n124\n00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.980\nIs it color?\n\n125\n00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.020\nNo, it's the absence of color.\n\n126\n00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.700\n>> I thought it was the opposite of that.\n\n127\n00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.040\nBlack is all colors.\n\n128\n00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.860\n>> Black is all colors.\n\n129\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:12.620\n>> All colors mixed up.\n\n130\n00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.220\n>> Are you sure?\n>> I'm pretty sure.\n\n131\n00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.870\nI'm pretty sure that's what it is.\n\n132\n00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.010\nIf you take all the crayons in the box and\nyou scribble them all together,\n\n133\n00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.570\nyou'll end up with a black page.\n\n134\n00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.580\n>> So, at least it helps us to\ndescribe the context of what\n\n135\n00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.790\nthe black and white image.\n\n136\n00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.740\n>> Right.\n\n137\n00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.016\nIt's not white that's for sure.\n\n138\n00:09:30.016 --> 00:09:30.845\n[LAUGH] It's not pink.\n\n139\n00:09:30.845 --> 00:09:37.290\n>> Right, right, and\nwhen you blend black and white together.\n\n140\n00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:37.956\n>> You get gray.\n\n141\n00:09:37.956 --> 00:09:41.397\n>> You get gray.\n\n142\n00:09:41.397 --> 00:09:41.980\nSpin.\n\n143\n00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:47.370\nSo Spin is another form\nof framework frame use.\n\n144\n00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.080\n>> This is something we should all be\nfamiliar with in these days, right?\n\n145\n00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.960\nThey love to spin something anymore.\n\n146\n00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.520\nWhere you take something that's happened,\nan event and it could be to\n\n147\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.680\nyour detriment, but we frame it in\nsuch a way and then we're using what\n\n148\n00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.030\nwe more commonly call Spin to make people\nthink, well that's not really that bad.\n\n149\n00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.350\nIt's actually a good thing.\n\n150\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.230\nSo we're spinning it and\nthat's why we called it Spin.\n\n151\n00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:10.370\nRight?\n>> That's why we called it Spin.\n\n152\n00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:10.880\nRight.\n\n153\n00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.580\n>> Yup.\n>> Probably comes off of really like\n\n154\n00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.240\ndisk jockey.\n\n155\n00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.500\nLike you're spinning a record.\n\n156\n00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.560\nSo spinning a label.\n\n157\n00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.600\nSpinning a yarn.\n\n158\n00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.740\nOf course spinning a yarn\nprobably comes off\n\n159\n00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.190\nof the old spinning wheel where at\npeople were actually creating yarn.\n\n160\n00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.950\nSo these are all just\nkind of concepts of that,\n\n161\n00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:42.710\nhow we use it is,\nwhen we are spinning a yarn,\n\n162\n00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.480\nit's best that we try to keep it simple.\n\n163\n00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.570\nStick to one subject.\n\n164\n00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:49.965\nOne.\n\n165\n00:10:49.965 --> 00:10:55.090\nTry to make that purpose clear that we're\n\n166\n00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:58.970\ntalking about a particular element.\n\n167\n00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.950\nTry to avoid, when we're talking\nto people, technical language.\n\n168\n00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:08.920\nTry to keep it simple, so\nthat you don't lose that\n\n169\n00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:14.570\nsubject in the nomenclature\nthat they don't understand.\n\n170\n00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.760\nTry to explain something\ndown to layman terms.\n\n171\n00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.230\nAnd, I guess that's really trying to bring\nyou back to that point of similarity.\n\n172\n00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.590\n>> Now Tom, how do we take,\nwe're getting into framing here,\n\n173\n00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.720\nand we're trying to\nexplain what framing is.\n\n174\n00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.890\nI think you've gotten us through a couple\nof different ways in which we can frame\n\n175\n00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.490\nsome kind of sub-framing topics,\nif you would.\n\n176\n00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:40.750\nHow do we take that and use that,\nas a social engineer to\n\n177\n00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:45.489\nelicit maybe some data or\ninformation that we would need?\n\n178\n00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.850\n>> Well, try to define your\nquestions to fit the target.\n\n179\n00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.870\n>> Hm.\n>> Fit the person.\n\n180\n00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.506\nLet's say if we were out to.\n\n181\n00:11:59.827 --> 00:12:03.148\nDo something like a fake support call.\n\n182\n00:12:03.148 --> 00:12:09.630\nRight, frame it in terms\nof who's a great company.\n\n183\n00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.802\nWho's a company that would call me for\na support call?\n\n184\n00:12:11.802 --> 00:12:14.407\nMicrosoft maybe?\n\n185\n00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.580\nTry to pick that, pick an item say,\n\n186\n00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:27.090\nwe've detected something like\na virus on your machine.\n\n187\n00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:28.470\nIn fact, we got a little video.\n\n188\n00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.370\nTo kinda pull up on this.\n\n189\n00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.270\n>> I love illustrations.\n\n190\n00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.409\n>> So, do you think we can\nroll that video at this point?\n\n191\n00:12:37.409 --> 00:12:41.940\n[SOUND]\n>> Hello.\n\n192\n00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.340\nHow may I direct your call?\n\n193\n00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.060\n>> Hi.\nThis is Mr. Smith from Microsoft, we have\n\n194\n00:12:46.060 -->

life.\n\n225\n00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:11.930\nI know I do.\n\n226\n00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.140\n>> I am fortunate enough to have\nnever have received a call.\n\n227\n00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.780\n>> No?\n>> I know Ronnie has,\n\n228\n00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.670\none of our other hosts.\n\n229\n00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.280\nHe's definitely had that call.\n\n230\n00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.310\n>> Yeah.\n>> I have worked with people\n\n231\n00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:21.510\nthat have received that call.\n\n232\n00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:25.550\nI have been successful at\navoiding that type of thing.\n\n233\n00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.230\n>> Well the crazy part about it\nis that you get and then you go,\n\n234\n00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.820\nwell, and then we play with this person.\n\n235\n00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.380\nAnd then you realise that you're\nactually just wasting your time.\n\n236\n00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.340\nYou're gonna get to some point where\nthere's gonna be some money exchanged,\n\n237\n00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.647\nand you're not gonna exchange any money.\n\n238\n00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:45.190\nI just blew a half hour of my\ntime jerking this person around.\n\n239\n00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.530\nSo probably the best thing with those\ntypes of calls are to just say, forget it,\n\n240\n00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:54.610\ntake me off your list please, Sollie no.\n\n241\n00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.510\nWe don't want your help.\n\n242\n00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:07.460\nBut we do have to kind of think\nabout influence here to a degree.\n\n243\n00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.845\nIn there, there's a concept\nthat I call Henry's Rule.\n\n244\n00:15:13.845 --> 00:15:20.415\nSo Henry Osterander was\na con man in the 20s.\n\n245\n00:15:21.785 --> 00:15:27.225\nExtremely, extremely effective at\ntalking people into anything and\n\n246\n00:15:27.225 --> 00:15:31.665\nafter he was put in jail he\nbasically came up with the,\n\n247\n00:15:31.665 --> 00:15:36.470\nthey kind of interviewed him and\nit's known as Henry's Rule.\n\n248\n00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.100\nSo Henry basically says, people will\n\n249\n00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.310\ndo just about anything if\nyou give them enough reason.\n\n250\n00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.416\nAnd he was extremely effective.\n\n251\n00:15:48.416 --> 00:15:52.295\nI mean building the investment scams,\n\n252\n00:15:52.295 --> 00:15:56.645\ngiving people investment opportunities,\n\n253\n00:15:56.645 --> 00:16:02.754\nI mean even after being in jail\nthis guy gets out and becomes a,\n\n254\n00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:08.066\nsaid he was reformed,\nHe starts to work for a church.\n\n255\n00:16:08.066 --> 00:16:12.900\nHe then starts running the financial\noffice for the church.\n\n256\n00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.243\nEventually gets everybody in the church to\nget involved in these investment schemes\n\n257\n00:16:17.243 --> 00:16:21.232\nand just runs the whole scam game again,\nit's happened time and time again.\n\n258\n00:16:21.232 --> 00:16:26.335\n>> And what's interesting is that he's\nbeen put away for scamming people out\n\n259\n00:16:26.335 --> 00:16:32.167\nof money, and unfortunately we have that\ngullibility that we talked about earlier,\n\n260\n00:16:32.167 --> 00:16:36.703\nin the fact that they wanted to\nbelieve that he was a reformed man and\n\n261\n00:16:36.703 --> 00:16:39.145\nput him in charge of money, right?\n\n262\n00:16:39.145 --> 00:16:43.410\nThis is, even if he was reformed,\nprobably not the best form or\n\n263\n00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.790\nway to show that you believe him.\n\n264\n00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.463\n>> Right.\n>> Just because what did the Old Gipper\n\n265\n00:16:48.463 --> 00:16:49.390\nsay, right?\n\n266\n00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:50.951\nHe said, trust but verify.\n\n267\n00:16:50.951 --> 00:16:51.834\n>> Trust but verify.\n\n268\n00:16:51.834 --> 00:16:54.601\n>> I wanna verify that he's reformed\nbefore I put him in charge of our\n\n269\n00:16:54.601 --> 00:16:55.313\nmoney, right?\n\n270\n00:16:55.313 --> 00:17:01.321\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So one of the things we talked about,\n\n271\n00:17:01.321 --> 00:17:07.990\nbias, about cognitive dissonance and\ndisparity.\n\n272\n00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:14.295\nHere's an example of how it might work,\nwhat they call the shock drop.\n\n273\n00:17:14.295 --> 00:17:17.495\nSo I'm gonna give you this product,\n\n274\n00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:21.465\nthis product's gonna run you,\nyou would think it would be 59.95, but\n\n275\n00:17:23.692 --> 00:17:28.542\nwe're gonna drop it to $19.95,\nwe're gonna give you two for the price.\n\n276\n00:17:28.542 --> 00:17:31.502\nSo, generally you throw\na high price out there,\n\n277\n00:17:31.502 --> 00:17:34.622\nand then you drop it down to a lower\nprice that seems reasonable.\n\n278\n00:17:34.622 --> 00:17:36.122\nYou start from a high point.\n\n279\n00:17:36.122 --> 00:17:39.142\nSometimes in real estate,\nthey'll take a person, and\n\n280\n00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:43.810\nthey will show them\na really crappy house for\n\n281\n00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:47.980\na high price, and then bring them\nto a much more luxurious place.\n\n282\n00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:52.200\nSo, bring that contrast\nprinciple into play,\n\n283\n00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.980\nand that tends to work out really well for\nthem.\n\n284\n00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.950\nJewelers will sometimes put\nthe expensive item out there\n\n285\n00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:04.080\nbefore the less expensive item,\nbut sometimes it works in reverse.\n\n286\n00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.830\nThere was a person was\nselling this kind of\n\n287\n00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:14.150\nNew Mexico type turquoise jewelry,\nand it wasn't moving.\n\n288\n00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.858\nRight, so the manager tried everything,\n\n289\n00:18:16.858 --> 00:18:21.386\ntried changing it in a different view,\nputting it in a different case.\n\n290\n00:18:21.386 --> 00:18:25.338\nEventually I mean it just wasn't selling,\nso he decided that he was just gonna half\n\n291\n00:18:25.338 --> 00:18:28.810\nit, just try to get rid of it,\nget his money back for it.\n\n292\n00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:32.590\nSo he wrote a little note that said 2 X,\n\n293\n00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:37.560\nand gave it to one of\nthe clerks to take care of it.\n\n294\n00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.620\nAnd the manager was going away for\na couple of days.\n\n295\n00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.505\nManager came back,\nsaw that all the jewelry was gone.\n\n296\n00:18:44.505 --> 00:18:47.200\nSold, says it worked.\n\n297\n00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.220\nBut the catch of the story was that\nthe clerk thought that he wanted\n\n298\n00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:55.610\nto double the price, so he actually\nincrease the price of the jewelry, which\n\n299\n00:18:55.610 --> 00:19:00.040\nmade it appear to be more valuable, and\nsometimes people see things in that way.\n\n300\n00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.260\n>> Yeah, that is interesting.\n\n301\n00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.840\nIt's something that I even find myself\nindulging in it from time to time.\n\n302\n00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.570\nWhere I'll look at a product that I wanna\nbuy, and of course you've got the A, B and\n\n303\n00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:15.740\nC price, right, the A price meaning the\nhigh level very top shelf kind of product,\n\n304\n00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.150\nB being the midrange, and C being\nthe lowest, cheapest thing you can buy.\n\n305\n00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.400\nThey all do the exact same thing,\nwell what do I do?\n\n306\n00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.121\nI don't want the cheap one, right.\n\n307\n00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:25.560\nBecause I know it's gonna break,\nit's less quality.\n\n308\n00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.400\nSo I can't afford the A,\nso I gravitate toward B.\n\n309\n00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.202\nIf I can, I'll buy the A because I know\nit's higher quality, but it's all based on\n\n310\n00:19:34.202 --> 00:19:38.335\nthe fact that I look at the prices to\nsee which one should be valued more.\n\n311\n00:19:38.335 --> 00:19:39.327\n>> Sure, sure.\n\n312\n00:19:39.327 --> 00:19:40.122\n>> I know what I'm doing.\n\n313\n00:19:40.122 --> 00:19:40.654\n>> Yeah.\n\n314\n00:19:40.654 --> 00:19:44.607\n>> I shouldn't do this, I should read\nreviews, see what people think about\n\n315\n00:19:44.607 --> 00:19:48.011\nthe products and not go off of\nwhat the seller is selling it for.\n\n316\n00:19:48.011 --> 00:19:51.130\n>> And that's what we call affecturistics.\n\n317\n00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:57.728\nYou know what you should be doing,\nbut you overlook all those flags.\n\n318\n00:19:57.728 --> 00:19:58.671\n>> Right.\n\n319\n00:19:58.671 --> 00:20:03.330\n>> You basically, you knew right\noff the bat you wanted that.\n\n320\n00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:08.810\nYes, so\npeople have the material self-interest.\n\n321\n00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:13.220\nSo material self interest is\nprobably one of the things that\n\n322\n00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:18.190\nmost people are suckered\ninto getting a good deal.\n\n323\n00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:21.377\nFor instance, say you're online, and\n\n324\n00:20:21.377 --> 00:20:25.793\nyou wanna buy a copy of Office,\nwhich may run $200.\n\n325\n00:20:25.793 --> 00:20:29.980\nBut yet you see, there's the Asian site,\n\n326\n00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.503\nthey got it for like $29.95.\n\n327\n00:20:33.503 --> 00:20:39.279\nWho's gonna know if I don't\nhave an official license?\n\n328\n00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:41.600\nOr maybe I'll get an official license for\nthat.\n\n329\n00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.590\nMaybe they got some special deal\nwith Microsoft that they could\n\n330\n00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.320\nreally sell that product for that price.\n\n331\n00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.095\n>> It seems reasonable.\n\n332\n00:20:48.095 --> 00:20:52.920\n>> It seems reasonable, yeah, so-\n>> What do they say,\n\n333\n00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.810\nif it seems too good to be true,\nit usually is.\n\n334\n00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.560\n>> It is too good to be true.\n\n335\n00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.678\nBut at the same time your material self\ninterest says, I'd rather have that\n\n336\n00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:07.180\n$70 $80 in my pocket,\nI could buy something else with that.\n\n337\n00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.621\nSo that's kind of like a form of greed,\nyeah.\n\n338\n00:21:10.621 --> 00:21:17.810\nAnd greed is usually one of those factors\nthat suckers people into making a plunge.\n\n339\n00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:22.313\nWhen actually buying the product or\n\n340\n00:21:22.313 --> 00:21:27.116\ngiving into it, greed is usually what\n\n341\n00:21:27.116 --> 00:21:31.931\nthe whole Nigerian scam is all about.\n\n342\n00:21:31.931 --> 00:21:33.440\nAnd that's been around.\n\n343\n00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:38.980\nI can recall actually getting an actual\nNigerian scam letter, like physical paper.\n\n344\n00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:39.994\n>> Like physical paper?\n\n345\n00:21:39.994 --> 00:21:41.336\n>> Physical paper,\n\n346\n00:21:41.336 --> 00:21:47.180\nyeah I mean really that's the way\nthey did it probably 20 years ago.\n\n347\n00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:52.963\nAs the Internet kind of hit Nigeria,\nthey jumped right on that one,\n\n348\n00:21:52.963 --> 00:21:59.875\nbut now it's like there are British\nlotteries, there's the work at home scam.\n\n349\n00:21:59.875 --> 00:22:05.024\nThere's so many scams that really pull\non the material self interest fact that,\n\n350\n00:22:05.024 --> 00:22:09.944\nand I'm not sure, but I'd love to see\nthe statistics in terms of the number of\n\n351\n00:22:09.944 --> 00:22:13.510\npeople that actually bite and\njump on that one?\n\n352\n00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:19.170\nSo, greed probably is, and\nmaterial self interest is probably the big\n\n353\n00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:24.550\none that pulls us all into\nbiting at these things.\n\n354\n00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:28.510\n>> So they use that to influence\nus to jump at the bait, right?\n\n355\n00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:33.280\nTo say hey, I know x amount of people\nare gonna respond greedily, if I frame\n\n356\n00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.780\nthis in such a way that it makes them\nfeel that there's some interest.\n\n357\n00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.717\n>> You can hear the parent going,\nif it's too good to be true, it is.\n\n358\n00:22:40.717 --> 00:22:41.358\n>> Right.\n\n359\n00:22:41.358 --> 00:22:42.801\n>> There's no such thing as a free lunch.\n\n360\n00:22:42.801 --> 00:22:47.291\nYou know what I mean,\nbut hey, give it a try.\n\n361\n00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:52.716\nAnd then if it's a pretty woman,\nyou're really a sucker, yeah.\n\n362\n00:22:52.716 --> 00:22:54.756\n>> I call it wife logic.\n\n363\n00:22:54.756 --> 00:22:57.610\nShe says, I spent $200 at the mall today.\n\n364\n00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.714\nAnd I got this, I got that,\nI got that, I got that.\n\n365\n00:22:59.714 --> 00:23:01.206\nAnd you're like, wow.\n\n366\n00:23:01.206 --> 00:23:05.225\nAnd she goes, look how much money I\nsaved just because this was a deal.\n\n367\n00:23:05.225 --> 00:23:06.644\nThat was a deal.\n\n368\n00:23:06.644 --> 00:23:07.510\nAnd this was a deal.\n\n369\n00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:12.480\nShe's framing it as a,\nwe saved money, because we\n\n370\n00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.720\nhad to get these things anyway, and\ntherefore I was gonna buy these anyway.\n\n371\n00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.390\nI had to have these three new dresses,\nand I was gonna get them anyway, but\n\n372\n00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:24.490\nI got them all at a discount, because I\nbought all three instead of one at a time.\n\n373\n00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.059\nSo I saved us money, and\nTony that's why I always call it,\n\n374\n00:23:27.059 --> 00:23:29.272\nI say there you go with\nyour wife logic again.\n\n375\n00:23:29.272 --> 00:23:31.281\n[LAUGH] You've saving me\nmoney by spending it.\n\n376\n00:23:31.281 --> 00:23:31.985\n>> Right.\n\n377\n00:23:31.985 --> 00:23:33.632\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n378\n00:23:33.632 --> 00:23:38.650\nthe next one is if it\ncomes from an authority.\n\n379\n00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:46.982\nNow, an authority can be someone in\na political office or a police officer.\n\n380\n00:23:46.982 --> 00:23:51.512\nBut authority is also somebody\nwith more experience,\n\n381\n00:23:51.512 --> 00:23:54.375\nsomebody that is knowledgeable.\n\n382\n00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:59.570\nCertainly you're gonna refer to them\nwhen you need to make a decision.\n\n383\n00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.152\nWe all have those\nauthorities in our lives.\n\n384\n00:24:01.152 --> 00:24:05.306\nSo, if a person comes off to us\nin that way, shape, or form,\n\n385\n00:24:05.306 --> 00:24:10.862\nwe're gonna be more apt to trust their\njudgement on it, than our own judgement.\n\n386\n00:24:10.862 --> 00:24:17.921\nSo, we learned to respect these people,\nsometimes we'll do it out of fear.\n\n387\n00:24:22.243 --> 00:24:27.089\nNobody wants to go to jail or\nworse yet, burn in hell,\n\n388\n00:24:27.089 --> 00:24:31.090\nbecause I didn't conform to this request.\n\n389\n00:24:36.473 --> 00:24:43.880\nAuthority allows us to really use\nthe affect heuristic technique.\n\n390\n00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.770\nBecause people will then tend to\nrather than use that judgement,\n\n391\n00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:55.640\nthat critical thinking,\nthey'll tend to defer to that\n\n392\n00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.020\nperson of experience rather\nthan their own self.\n\n393\n00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:08.980\nSo, again, we're still going back to this\nchild parent adult type of behavior.\n\n394\n00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:13.680\n>> Except for us as grown ups, we're\nstill talking about the affect heuristic.\n\n395\n00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:18.330\nWe're basically saying it's easier to just\nlet him tell me what I should do, and\n\n396\n00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:19.410\njust do that.\n\n397\n00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:19.980\n>> Right.\n\n398\n00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.954\n>> The Captain said it was all right,\nit must be all right.\n\n399\n00:25:22.954 --> 00:25:23.953\n>> Yeah.\n\n400\n00:25:23.953 --> 00:25:25.704\n[LAUGH]\n>> Captain said drop the anchor.\n\n401\n00:25:25.704 --> 00:25:30.460\nSo there's a story about World War II\npilots where one guy was in\n\n402\n00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:35.484\ncharge of the landing gear, and\nas the plane was about to take off,\n\n403\n00:25:35.484 --> 00:25:41.535\nand he would pull up the landing gear,\nhe'd pull up the landing gear too early.\n\n404\n00:25:41.535 --> 00:25:45.782\nBoom, the plane dropped,\nand why'd you do that?\n\n405\n00:25:45.782 --> 00:25:51.040\nAnd he thought that the captain nodded for\nhim that was the time to do it.\n\n406\n00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.970\nSimply following orders, and\n\n407\n00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:58.370\nnot really paying attention to what\nwas going on and what his job was.\n\n408\n00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:59.160\n>> Yeah.\n\n409\n00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:03.695\n>> So sometimes,\nauthority can be really damaging,\n\n410\n00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:09.370\ncertainly damaging to the plane,\ndamaging to yourself.\n\n411\n00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.668\n>> And speaking of World War II,\nthe Nazis,\n\n412\n00:26:12.668 --> 00:26:16.261\nwhat was their big excuse at Geneva,\nright?\n\n413\n00:26:16.261 --> 00:26:20.365\nWhen they were up on war crimes, they said\nwe were just following orders, right?\n\n414\n00:26:20.365 --> 00:26:21.846\nThey told me to do that, so I did it.\n\n415\n00:26:21.846 --> 00:26:24.560\n>> There you go.\n>> And it was no excuse.\n\n416\n00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.890\nWe're responsible for thinking these\nthings through so that we don't-\n\n417\n00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:29.830\n>> See, and there's a tough one.\n\n418\n00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:35.060\nI mean, really, you're in the military,\nthere's a chain of command,\n\n419\n00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:39.749\nbut yet, you're being told to do\nsomething that you know is morally wrong,\n\n420\n00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:47.370\nand your leader may have a screw loose,\n\n421\n00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:51.480\nwhat's the right way to behave?\n\n422\n00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:59.560\nYou're told to, hey, to not shoot this\nperson or not do this particular act.\n\n423\n00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:05.632\nAnd at the same time, you've gotta\ndefend yourself, or vice versa.\n\n424\n00:27:05.632 --> 00:27:12.198\nYou're told to shoot somebody, but\nyou don't think it's morally right.\n\n425\n00:27:12.198 --> 00:27:17.865\nThat's a real dilemma, and\nthat's gonna create real dissonance.\n\n426\n00:27:17.865 --> 00:27:21.659\n>> And, of course, the social influence,\nor the social engineer, obviously,\n\n427\n00:27:21.659 --> 00:27:24.561\ntypically, this isn't going\nto be about shooting people.\n\n428\n00:27:24.561 --> 00:27:28.710\nIt's gonna be about eliciting\ninformation out of someone.\n\n429\n00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:34.490\nIf you do find that person that\ndoesn't work in that, where they just\n\n430\n00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:38.920\nsay whatever you say I'll do it, they're\ntoo lazy to think about it critically.\n\n431\n00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:43.920\nIf they do engage in critical thinking\nof hm, well, riddle me this Batman,\n\n432\n00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.300\nwhat about such and\nsuch and such and such?\n\n433\n00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.036\nNow you have to be a good\nsocial engineer and\n\n434\n00:27:49.036 --> 00:27:52.988\nframe it in such a way where it\nbypasses that critical logic and\n\n435\n00:27:52.988 --> 00:27:58.162\nmakes sense in their world, so that\nthey'll continue to divulge information.\n\n436\n00:27:58.162 --> 00:28:05.490\n>> Right, so\nthe last part of authority is compliance.\n\n437\n00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:08.088\nAnd I'll say there's a great book, and\n\n438\n00:28:08.088 --> 00:28:12.760\nI've mentioned this a couple times,\nwhich is influenced by Cialdini.\n\n439\n00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:18.813\nAnd Cialdini has an interesting concept,\nwhat he calls social Jiu Jitsu.\n\n440\n00:28:18.813 --> 00:28:21.840\nSo Jiu Jitsu really means like soft hard.\n\n441\n00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:27.800\nThe idea of it is to be able\nto take a person's momentum,\n\n442\n00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:33.750\ntheir inertia, your leverage and those\nelements and utilize them against you.\n\n443\n00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.960\nThat's why well, a small\n\n444\n00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.005\nfemale trained in Jiu Jitsu could\nactually defeat a larger person.\n\n445\n00:28:42.005 --> 00:28:49.700\nThat's a super value really of\nthe understanding of those principles.\n\n446\n00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:56.105\nHow can we take the same\nconcepts of momentum,\n\n447\n00:28:56.105 --> 00:29:01.540\ninertia, leverage, and apply them?\n\n448\n00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:05.693\nThere was another book\nwritten called Mental Judo.\n\n449\n00:29:05.693 --> 00:29:09.819\nAnd Mental Judo actually has\nbeen applied through sales,\n\n450\n00:29:09.819 --> 00:29:13.535\nas well as conflict resolution,\naround the globe.\n\n451\n00:29:13.535 --> 00:29:18.315\nI mean, there's probably quite\na few copies have been sold.\n\n452\n00:29:18.315 --> 00:29:24.565\nAnd the basic concepts there, and\nour audience might be able to apply this,\n\n453\n00:29:24.565 --> 00:29:29.320\nis whenever one of your\nbuttons are pushed,\n\n454\n00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:36.040\nwhere feel yourself a little anxious or\ngonna fly off the handle, count to ten.\n\n455\n00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.961\nJust learn to back off, okay?\n\n456\n00:29:37.961 --> 00:29:45.213\nStop for a minute, gather your composure,\nokay, and then react to it.\n\n457\n00:29:45.213 --> 00:29:47.451\n[CROSSTALK] You'll find you'll\ndeal with it in a different way.\n\n458\n00:29:47.451 --> 00:29:52.306\nYeah, so basically Judo was really just\na modern version of Jiu Jitsu, but\n\n459\n00:29:52.306 --> 00:29:55.710\nyou're learning how to\nkeep somebody off balance.\n\n460\n00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:59.632\nSo if you take a little time,\nyou step back,\n\n461\n00:29:59.632 --> 00:30:05.463\nyou'll find that your technique\nmay not be being applied right,\n\n462\n00:30:05.463 --> 00:30:09.400\nbut keep your emotional\nreaction out of it.\n\n463\n00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.499\nTry to stay calm, cool, even-keeled.\n\n464\n00:30:12.499 --> 00:30:17.762\nAnd then, reassess your position,\n\n465\n00:30:17.762 --> 00:30:23.023\nlook at what you did, reformulate,\n\n466\n00:30:23.023 --> 00:30:26.600\nre-engage, reapply.\n\n467\n00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.253\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n468\n00:30:27.253 --> 00:30:28.002\n>> Yeah.\n\n469\n00:30:28.002 --> 00:30:30.927\n>> All right Tom, I'm looking\nat our clock, and unfortunately,\n\n470\n00:30:30.927 --> 00:30:33.570\nit has ticked down to the zero mark yet\nagain.\n\n471\n00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:34.530\nAlways does this to us.\n\n472\n00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:37.571\nSo it looks like we've got another one\nof our famous part twos in our future.\n\n473\n00:30:37.571 --> 00:30:38.273\n>> Part two.\n\n474\n00:30:38.273 --> 00:30:39.031\n>> Looking forward to that.\n\n475\n00:30:39.031 --> 00:30:40.396\nThank you so much for stopping by today.\n\n476\n00:30:40.396 --> 00:30:41.144\n>> Great.\n\n477\n00:30:41.144 --> 00:30:43.029\n>> And we thank you guys for watching us.\n\n478\n00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:48.376\nWell, we hope to see you in part two also,\nbut for this one, signing off for

another great episode of\nIT ProTv, I'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.449\nin today's episode we continue forth\nwith our social engineering series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.586\nJoining us in studio again to lend his\nexpertise on that great topic is our good\n\n6\n00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:28.150\nfriend, Mr Tom Updegrove.\n\n7\n00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.850\nTom welcome back it's so good to have you.\n\n8\n00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.090\n>> Thank you Daniel,\nI am so pleased to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.680\n>> So pleasant too.\n\n10\n00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.330\n>> Thank you.\n>> We're doing a part two though, right?\n\n11\n00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.440\nWe started talking about the influence.\n\n12\n00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.850\n>> I think on the last thing\nwe hit was authority, and\n\n13\n00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.949\nyou have some of the elements of\nauthority and that was compliant.\n\n14\n00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.060\nWhich really if you think about,\n\n15\n00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.670\ncompliance is also a big\npart of all IT policies.\n\n16\n00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.740\n>> We talk a lot about\ncompliance to IT policies.\n\n17\n00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.720\n>> And one really needs to\nkind of pay attention to that,\n\n18\n00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.180\nif you don't wanna get fined or\nwhatever, okay?\n\n19\n00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.035\nBut, and well I think it's important\nthat we're somewhat committed and\n\n20\n00:01:15.035 --> 00:01:17.690\nconsistent with our compliance.\n\n21\n00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.060\nAt the same time committment and\n\n22\n00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.850\nconsistency can be a downfall,\nit can be utilized against someone.\n\n23\n00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.080\nSay for instance person has\na particular mindset or\n\n24\n00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.240\nthey made a statement like I'd say,\nblack is the absence of all color, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.203\nAnd you go no, hey, you're going [SOUND].\n\n26\n00:01:40.203 --> 00:01:44.119\nIt depends on if you're dealing with\nlight, or if you're dealing with color,\n\n27\n00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.110\npaint like you're mixing colors,\nyou got a whole lot of it.\n\n28\n00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.620\nYou mix them all together, and\n\n29\n00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.430\nthat's pretty wacky, but\nthat is one example of contrast.\n\n30\n00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.560\nAnd how one perceives one thing or\nanother.\n\n31\n00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.392\nStill consistency a person\nmay say pick a point.\n\n32\n00:02:05.392 --> 00:02:13.397\nThey may say the sky is blue,\nand Or even worse yet, let's say.\n\n33\n00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:20.910\nHitler was right.\n\n34\n00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.400\nAnd even though you prove that person\nto be wrong somewhere along in\n\n35\n00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.470\na conversation, they'll really\nstick with their point of view.\n\n36\n00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.400\nEven though all the facts\nare pointing to it,\n\n37\n00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.660\nthey'll stick to their guns, and\nthey'll consistently stay with it.\n\n38\n00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.740\nSo consistency can be used\nin a way against a person.\n\n39\n00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.380\nBut you really have to watch,\nfor instance,\n\n40\n00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.120\nthat a person, even though they\nmay mentally be saying one thing,\n\n41\n00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.950\nphysically they may be something else.\n\n42\n00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.848\nTheir words and deeds or\ntheir actions may prove otherwise, so\n\n43\n00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:06.450\nsometimes consistency in a verbal theme,\n\n44\n00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.970\nmaybe being told differently\nin another theme.\n\n45\n00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.280\nSo, nonetheless consists\n\n46\n00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.720\nin the heart of rationality,\nstability and honesty.\n\n47\n00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.240\n>> I would definitely\nagree with that statement,\n\n48\n00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.740\nespecially when it comes\nto the rationality.\n\n49\n00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.260\nWe think of things like rules of logic,\nthe laws of logic,\n\n50\n00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.900\nlaw of non-contradiction.\n\n51\n00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.440\nA cannot be both A and not A in\nthe same time and in the same sense.\n\n52\n00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.330\nAnd therefore, contradictions\ncannot exist within each other, and\n\n53\n00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.850\nwhen we see inconsistencies, that points\nto us being irrational sometimes, right?\n\n54\n00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.398\nIf I'm being irrational,\nand you point that out,\n\n55\n00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:53.800\nor if you use it to your advantage.\n\n56\n00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.998\nHence in the context of\na social engineering.\n\n57\n00:03:57.998 --> 00:04:02.891\n>> For instance, you can get\na person into commit to a statement.\n\n58\n00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:04.605\nEven a kid.\n\n59\n00:04:04.605 --> 00:04:06.780\nI will not talk while in school.\n\n60\n00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.820\nYou make them write down\non a board 25 times.\n\n61\n00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.356\nWriting things down really\ndoes help people to,\n\n62\n00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:22.849\nagain, implement and\ncreate that condition behavior.\n\n63\n00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.550\nSo, another important aspect, but\n\n64\n00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.385\nsometimes maybe not\nnecessarily the contract, but\n\n65\n00:04:29.385 --> 00:04:34.803\nan agreement to do something,\nan agreement to buy, agreement to set in.\n\n66\n00:04:34.803 --> 00:04:38.487\nIf you can get a person to make\nan agreement to do something,\n\n67\n00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:42.190\nusually then yeah, well,\nI gave my word that I would do it.\n\n68\n00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.440\nYou get a person to make an agreement\nover the phone, then when you show up\n\n69\n00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.390\nin person, they're more apt to be\nable to follow through with that.\n\n70\n00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.500\nOnly because of the consistency principle.\n\n71\n00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.169\nSo, it's really one to consider.\n\n72\n00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.005\nSometimes, in other areas, concession, so\n\n73\n00:05:03.005 --> 00:05:10.452\nconcession could work within,\neven the kind of shack drop principle.\n\n74\n00:05:10.452 --> 00:05:15.721\nThere's a story about a boy scout who's\ngoing around knocking door to door,\n\n75\n00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:18.652\nand he's, I need $5 for my scout troop.\n\n76\n00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:21.850\nAnd I don't wanna give you $5.\n\n77\n00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.300\nWould you buy some chocolate bars for\na dollar?\n\n78\n00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.450\nWell, I'll take five of them.\n\n79\n00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.300\nSo in a sense, the big picture,\nyou say no, no, but\n\n80\n00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.780\nyou can see it on something smaller.\n\n81\n00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.658\nInstead of paying the high price,\n\n82\n00:05:34.658 --> 00:05:38.756\nyou'll pay the low price only because\nthe high price was thrown out there.\n\n83\n00:05:38.756 --> 00:05:41.306\nYou yourself you were kind\nof like a victim of that.\n\n84\n00:05:41.306 --> 00:05:44.030\nSo and-\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n\n85\n00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.760\n>> Now that I'm doing this big deal.\n\n86\n00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.660\nWould you take this little thing.\n\n87\n00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.100\n>> And then in the context of\nyour boy scout analogy here.\n\n88\n00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.510\nIf the kid doesn't get the five\ndollars as a donation, and\n\n89\n00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.260\nthen he sells five candy bars,\nhe's still getting his five dollars.\n\n90\n00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.050\nBut if he get's the donation and sells\nfive candy bars, he's doubled his profits.\n\n91\n00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.830\n>> He's doubled his profits.\n\n92\n00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.260\n>> And he's better off.\n\n93\n00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.010\n>> Better off, yea.\n\n94\n00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.702\nSo it's nice to have really the contrast\nof those kind of principles in\n\n95\n00:06:12.702 --> 00:06:19.744\nhis offering, so when approaching someone\nin social engineering have a second plan,\n\n96\n00:06:19.744 --> 00:06:24.580\na second option or\nsecond goal that you can kind of go after.\n\n97\n00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.522\nAnother aspect of the concession\nwas that Watergate.\n\n98\n00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:34.648\nG Gordon Liddy's initial proposal\nto Nixon cost a million dollars,\n\n99\n00:06:34.648 --> 00:06:39.506\nwhich he was so\ninsistent about running this plan, and\n\n100\n00:06:39.506 --> 00:06:43.517\nthe plan had so\nmany holes in it, there were so\n\n101\n00:06:43.517 --> 00:06:48.400\nmany flags that the thing\nshould have been cancelled.\n\n102\n00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.024\nBut he was insistent, what he did was,\nhe dropped the price to 250,000, and\n\n103\n00:06:53.024 --> 00:06:57.430\nthey decided to ahead with\nit based on the price alone.\n\n104\n00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:04.825\nSo here's another case where that contrast\nand a concession and cost became a factor.\n\n105\n00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:11.765\nAnd somebody agreeing with a persistent,\nassertive individual.\n\n106\n00:07:13.275 --> 00:07:19.175\nSo there are two plans,\ntwo approaches we'll really use,\n\n107\n00:07:19.175 --> 00:07:24.530\nin your Influenced approach to a subject.\n\n108\n00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.432\nGive them a lower alternative, give them\na better price, give them a better deal.\n\n109\n00:07:30.432 --> 00:07:35.092\n>> My dad, actually this is so funny,\nmy dad used to be a business agent for\n\n110\n00:07:35.092 --> 00:07:40.067\nthe teamsters union, and he would tell\nme about working these contracts and\n\n111\n00:07:40.067 --> 00:07:45.040\nworking these deals, and he'd have\na group of guys, and he'd say ok guys,\n\n112\n00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.364\nwhat's the lowest we'd\ngo as far as pay goes?\n\n113\n00:07:48.364 --> 00:07:53.143\nWe'll take x amount of dollars, let's just\nsay for the sake of argument $5 an hour,\n\n114\n00:07:53.143 --> 00:07:56.885\nwe're not taking any less than $5\nan hour or we're gonna strike.\n\n115\n00:07:56.885 --> 00:07:58.850\nWell, I'm gonna go see what I can.\n\n116\n00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.530\nI'm gonna get that for you guys.\n\n117\n00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:07.050\nAnd you go and you talk to the business\nand say, okay, what's the best you can do?\n\n118\n00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:12.448\nAnd they'll say, listen,\nwe can't do any better than $4.95.\n\n119\n00:08:12.448 --> 00:08:16.310\nAnd he'll go listen,\n\n120\n00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:21.160\nif you don't give us $5.25 an hour,\nwe're gonna strike.\n\n121\n00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.060\nI'll get everyone and\nwe'll get a vote tonight, we'll strike.\n\n122\n00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.990\nYour business is gonna\ncome to a standstill.\n\n123\n00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.480\nThey'll go, we can't do 5.25, he goes,\nhelp me out here, give me something.\n\n124\n00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.180\nCome back,\nthey say we can give you $5.10 an hour.\n\n125\n00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.420\nOkay, well let me talk to my guys and\nsee if they'll take that.\n\n126\n00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:41.230\nAnd he goes back and\nsay what you guys think, $5.10 sound good?\n\n127\n00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.440\nYes, it does, right,\n\n128\n00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.380\nhe goes back we agreed to $5.10 everybody\ncomes out thinking that they are a winner.\n\n129\n00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.730\n>> Sure.\n>> Based of that whole concession theory.\n\n130\n00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.050\n>> They call that the whole concession and\ncontrast.\n\n131\n00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.200\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah, yeah,\n\n132\n00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.680\nsometimes you up the ante by certainly\ngiving a person more responsibility.\n\n133\n00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.580\nAnd, that kind of sweetens the deal.\n\n134\n00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.460\nYou give them a sense of more authority.\n\n135\n00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:11.256\nWell, we can't give you a raise,\nbut we'll give you a better title.\n\n136\n00:09:11.256 --> 00:09:19.325\nYou'll be Assistant Vice President to\nthe Secretary of the Janitorial Squad.\n\n137\n00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:20.512\n>> Exactly.\n\n138\n00:09:20.512 --> 00:09:24.280\n[LAUGH] The Custodial Arts.\n\n139\n00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.680\n>> So, and\nthen it brings us to likability.\n\n140\n00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.854\nLikeability is a probably\nthe key number one principle.\n\n141\n00:09:34.854 --> 00:09:40.879\nIf you can mirror the individual, if you\ncan come across with the right tone,\n\n142\n00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:44.599\nif you can come across\nin the right mannerisms.\n\n143\n00:09:44.599 --> 00:09:49.451\nIf you're a likeable person, you gonna get\nfurther in the world than someone who's\n\n144\n00:09:49.451 --> 00:09:52.450\ndisliked, that's just common sense.\n\n145\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:57.320\nHow do you get to be\na more likeable person?\n\n146\n00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:03.640\nSome people seem to\nrespond well to flattery.\n\n147\n00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.352\nIn fact, I think flattery wins hands down.\n\n148\n00:10:07.352 --> 00:10:08.595\n>> A little sucking up, right?\n\n149\n00:10:08.595 --> 00:10:12.100\n>> Right,\nthe whole you get more flies with honey.\n\n150\n00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.350\nCertainly the more someone likes you,\n\n151\n00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:21.090\nthe more power you have over them.\n\n152\n00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:25.870\nSometimes people will like you\nmore if they've just even seen\n\n153\n00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.690\nyou somewhere.\n\n154\n00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:35.110\nSo a way to maybe win somebody\nover would be if you're trying to\n\n155\n00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:40.540\ninfluence this particular manager,\nperson in charge.\n\n156\n00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.510\nI mean you stake it out, you've done\nyour research, you know where they,\n\n157\n00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:44.980\nwhat food store to go to.\n\n158\n00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.150\nI mean if you happen to bump into him or\n\n159\n00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.900\nyou're checking out in line and\nyou seem to get into a conversation.\n\n160\n00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.458\nI mean when you walk up to him face\nto face with him it's not like\n\n161\n00:10:53.458 --> 00:10:54.730\nyou're a stranger.\n\n162\n00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:59.360\nI met this guy before,\nhe was all right, and hence your\n\n163\n00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.400\nlikability radiating kinda\nsoars with that one.\n\n164\n00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.070\n>> Yeah,\nit never hurts to be liked by the people.\n\n165\n00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.390\nLike Tom was saying, you're not gonna\nget very far if no one likes you.\n\n166\n00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.770\nActually you're gonna create conflict, and\n\n167\n00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.930\nthey're gonna be less apt\nto do anything for you.\n\n168\n00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:20.390\nEven general considerations that we give\nto just the average Joe on the street.\n\n169\n00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:24.110\nNow they will probably cut their\nnose off to spite their face just so\n\n170\n00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:25.930\nthey can get at you because\nthey don't like you.\n\n171\n00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:30.495\nSo you have to have some general\ngoodwill toward them and\n\n172\n00:11:30.495 --> 00:11:33.695\nlikability where, man,\nwe have the same interests.\n\n173\n00:11:33.695 --> 00:11:38.625\nThis guy's always kind to me, he's\nalways good to me, does things for me.\n\n174\n00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:41.285\nI like that person, that's a nice person.\n\n175\n00:11:41.285 --> 00:11:44.685\nWhat makes them wanna do,\nwe talked about the whole gifting.\n\n176\n00:11:44.685 --> 00:11:46.445\nThey've done for me, I wanna do for them.\n\n177\n00:11:46.445 --> 00:11:49.535\nI like them, they like me,\nI wanna do for them.\n\n178\n00:11:49.535 --> 00:11:52.305\nIt makes them more apt to be amicable.\n\n179\n00:11:52.305 --> 00:11:57.290\n>> Right, and not only that,\nthe fact that I'm your friend,\n\n180\n00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:59.420\nnow I get extended the courtesy of that.\n\n181\n00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.400\n>> Yeah.\n>> And that can work in the inverse,\n\n182\n00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:07.140\nbecause naturally\nthe salesman is going to say,\n\n183\n00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.350\nhey, you don't want to buy the product.\n\n184\n00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.360\nBut one of your friends might.\n\n185\n00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.705\nOr you bought the product, and\nnaturally the next thing you say,\n\n186\n00:12:15.705 --> 00:12:19.360\nwell you know anybody else\nthat's interested in Tupperware?\n\n187\n00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.430\nAnd basically that's how\n\n188\n00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:30.230\nall the multilevel marketing schemes work.\n\n189\n00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.350\nWe won't call them scams because\nthey do provide awesome products.\n\n190\n00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.305\n>> We won't use the word pyramid will we?\n\n191\n00:12:36.305 --> 00:12:40.890\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, and\nI guess that, you know,\n\n192\n00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:45.520\ncertainly, there are those pyramid\nschemes that start with nothing.\n\n193\n00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.690\nBuild up, you know,\ncertainly the financial pyramids, I mean,\n\n194\n00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:53.380\nthey're certainly the worst.\n\n195\n00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:59.400\nBut those types of things really\nutilize all the elements of\n\n196\n00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:05.200\nreciprocity, committment and social proof,\nwhich we're hitting in a minute.\n\n197\n00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:11.150\nAnd so, if somebody says to you,\n\n198\n00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:16.220\nhey, well do you know Daniel from ITProTV?\n\n199\n00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.200\nFact, well he referred me,\n\n200\n00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.780\nhe said that you might be of help, or\nyou might be interested in this product.\n\n201\n00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:29.510\nAnd you know he loves it and the fact that\nwell Dana loves it I guess is pretty cool.\n\n202\n00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:36.470\nSo I'm gonna lend myself I'm gonna take\na shot at it anyway., look at it you know?\n\n203\n00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.639\nLet the guy spend a little\ntime talking to me about it.\n\n204\n00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:46.610\nAnd then of course, in a way,\nthat kind of makes me a little obligated.\n\n205\n00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:54.800\nSo obligation becomes another of these\nsocial influence, you might say weapons.\n\n206\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.819\nBecause they can be used in either way.\n\n207\n00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:04.885\nCertainly a sword can be used as a weapon,\nbut it could be used to slice cheese,\n\n208\n00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:08.880\nused in self defense.\n\n209\n00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:15.210\nBut we have an inbred\nobligation to reciprocate.\n\n210\n00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:19.700\nIf you do give me something,\nI have to give something back.\n\n211\n00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.070\nIf I don't, I'm a cheapskate,\nI'm a tightwad.\n\n212\n00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:30.820\nSame thing goes for,\nA tip at a restaurant here.\n\n213\n00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.140\nYou gave me good service,\nI'm gonna give you,\n\n214\n00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.810\nreally I have no problem with\ngiving a tip for good service.\n\n215\n00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:41.270\nDo you know where tip actually comes from?\n\n216\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.880\n>> I don't.\n>> T-I-P, is to ensure promptness.\n\n217\n00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.710\nIt was given prior to the meal,\nit's an old English custom.\n\n218\n00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.570\nGiven prior to the meal just to\nmake sure you got what you wanted.\n\n219\n00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:55.714\nWhich would work better than getting\na crappy serving, a crappy meal and\n\n220\n00:14:55.714 --> 00:15:00.282\nthen you know say you know I\nhave to give 10%, 20% any way.\n\n221\n00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:07.381\nWhich, back in Philadelphia,\nthere was this big thing that went\n\n222\n00:15:07.381 --> 00:15:12.081\ndown with the LeSean McCoy,\nLeSean McCoy was a Philadelphia Eagle.\n\n223\n00:15:12.081 --> 00:15:19.070\nHe was at my son's restaurant,\nhe left a 20 cent tip on like a $65 bill.\n\n224\n00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.385\nAnd this thing hit the wire.\n\n225\n00:15:21.385 --> 00:15:22.700\n>> Ttat was a happy server.\n\n226\n00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.930\n>> Yeah, well, it's crazy, it went viral.\n\n227\n00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.845\nIt went on Facebook, it went viral.\n\n228\n00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:34.170\nThis thing went around the country to\n\n229\n00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:42.428\nthe point that people actually\nsent money to the server.\n\n230\n00:15:42.428 --> 00:15:48.291\nHe got $1,000 from You know,\nfrom a Hollywood star.\n\n231\n00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:50.572\n>> I see a scam in there somewhere.\n\n232\n00:15:50.572 --> 00:15:55.568\n>> Not this, but I mean by taking that\nidea and going, hey I'll just put it\n\n233\n00:15:55.568 --> 00:16:00.770\non Facebook that I was served by\nLebron James and he stiffed me on a tip.\n\n234\n00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.070\nAnd everybody will believe it and\nsend me money.\n\n235\n00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.570\n>> Well that's what happened.\n\n236\n00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:09.591\nPeople saw it and said,\nwe saw the same thing with another actor.\n\n237\n00:16:09.591 --> 00:16:18.280\nAnd it actually wound up\nbeing auctioned off on Ebay.\n\n238\n00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:25.540\nAnd this thing wound up,\nthe highest bidder was $99,000.\n\n239\n00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.690\nYeah.\n\n240\n00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:27.750\n>> And what was the thing?\n\n241\n00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.630\n>> It just was an autograph\nof LeSean McCoy.\n\n242\n00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:32.840\n>> Wow.\n>> Yeah.\n\n243\n00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.410\n>> That's a lot of money.\n\n244\n00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.020\n>> That's a lot of money so, LeSean,\nthank you for the $0.20 tip because-\n\n245\n00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.817\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, we appreciate it.\n\n246\n00:16:39.817 --> 00:16:42.170\n>> Yeah, we appreciate that a lot.\n\n247\n00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:47.890\n[LAUGH] So we hit reciprocity but the rule\nsays yeah, we should repay in kind.\n\n248\n00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.550\nIf not even equal, maybe something better.\n\n249\n00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.620\nAnd it's universal,\nit runs through all cultures.\n\n250\n00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.752\nSometimes it's imbued\nthat we give something.\n\n251\n00:17:02.225 --> 00:17:05.210\nBut sometimes it can go crazy.\n\n252\n00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:10.280\nFor instance,\nthe story of the guy who needed a jump,\n\n253\n00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.320\nhis car battery died and\nthere was a guy around there.\n\n254\n00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.580\nAnd this has happened to me.\n\n255\n00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.850\nPeople say, hey do you need a jump start?\n\n256\n00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.420\nBecause people are kind and generous.\n\n257\n00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:25.190\nSo this kid helped him\nget the car started.\n\n258\n00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.400\nThe guy says look,\nif there's anything you ever need,\n\n259\n00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.560\nhere's my number just let me know.\n\n260\n00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:36.930\nA few days later the kid said, hey you\nsaid if there was anything you could do.\n\n261\n00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.020\nI need to borrow your car for a short bit.\n\n262\n00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:46.260\nThe guy was like, well, well,\nI committed to saying I would, so here.\n\n263\n00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.780\nHe had to stick to his word.\n\n264\n00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.070\nKid totaled the car.\n\n265\n00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.661\n>> Of course.\n\n266\n00:17:50.661 --> 00:17:52.752\n>> Totaled the car.\n\n267\n00:17:52.752 --> 00:17:53.400\n>> No good deed goes unpunished.\n\n268\n00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.720\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's a shame, but I don't think that\n\n269\n00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.060\nthat really should stop anyone from being-\n>> Altruistic.\n\n270\n00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.380\n>> Yeah, altruistic to a degree.\n\n271\n00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:09.170\nBut we gotta remember,\nas we hit the last part in\n\n272\n00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:13.976\nremediation, how to apply the BS detector.\n\n273\n00:18:13.976 --> 00:18:18.570\nHow to use yor critical thinking.\n\n274\n00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:19.570\n>> The sniff test.\n\n275\n00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.660\n>> Yeah, to kind of save yourself.\n\n276\n00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.100\nSurprise, sometimes surprise is\none of the best ways, you know.\n\n277\n00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:31.859\nAnd I think that surprise might be\nan element in terms of if you're asked\n\n278\n00:18:31.859 --> 00:18:36.242\na particular question,\nsometimes it's best to take it head on.\n\n279\n00:18:36.242 --> 00:18:38.761\nBut maybe shift gears a little\nbit with them, you know?\n\n280\n00:18:38.761 --> 00:18:44.110\nSo if a particular element isn't working,\n\n281\n00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:50.480\nit's best to kinda just change up,\nchange themes.\n\n282\n00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.350\nScarcity.\n\n283\n00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.920\nScarcity is another important element and\nit is used all the time.\n\n284\n00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:01.900\nAnd we know that, look, I'm in here\n\n285\n00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:06.870\nto check your network out.\n\n286\n00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:11.340\nWe got a report that there's some type of\n\n287\n00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:18.612\ncommunication problem between your email\nserver and your clients out there.\n\n288\n00:19:18.612 --> 00:19:22.900\nWe're not sure, maybe it's a bad switch.\n\n289\n00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:27.770\nBut the company sent us\nout to check it out and.\n\n290\n00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:29.760\nBut I only really got\na half hour to do it.\n\n291\n00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:35.980\nIn fact, I've got, my wife's in,\njust I think she's in the hospital.\n\n292\n00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.880\nI said I would be there.\n\n293\n00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.290\nReal short, so\nwe gotta get in there at this point.\n\n294\n00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:46.240\nOr come up with some type of excuse as\nto why this needs to be done now and\n\n295\n00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.980\nthat this is the only time we can do it.\n\n296\n00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:48.980\n>> Right.\nThe scarcity.\n\n297\n00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.060\n>> Yeah. Right. >> Is the time frame.\n\n298\n00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.460\n>> We see it all the time\nin products we had offered.\n\n299\n00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:56.200\nThis product is offered only now,\nin the next hour.\n\n300\n00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.190\nAnd there's only fifty people\nthat are gonna get it.\n\n301\n00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:04.560\n>> Shopping networks make vast\nfortunes off this very principle.\n\n302\n00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.660\n>> It's a standard rule of advertisement.\n\n303\n00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.140\nYou know, give a time and a place.\n\n304\n00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:16.010\nI make an offer and when I get\nsomebody a quote for network service,\n\n305\n00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:19.410\nI'll say,\nall right this quote is good for 30 days.\n\n306\n00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.180\nCuz in actuality things\nmay change in that time.\n\n307\n00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:29.062\nSo I mean there's some reality to\nthe scarcity part but it's certainly used.\n\n308\n00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:33.550\nAnd if all these elements\nare being laid out for you.\n\n309\n00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:41.060\nThey're all kind of red flags of\nsome type of deceitful behavior.\n\n310\n00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.990\n>> Yeah, you should at this point\nbe feeling the sense that someone\n\n311\n00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.210\nis basically trying to\nsell you on something.\n\n312\n00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:48.372\nAnd that's what we're trying to say.\n\n313\n00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:53.935\nIf someone keeps talking about how,\nwe've only gonna get this much time and\n\n314\n00:20:53.935 --> 00:20:59.310\nyou know that it's counter to what\nthe policy is for your company.\n\n315\n00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.880\nIt doesn't matter how much time is scarce,\nthat's not a factor.\n\n316\n00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.530\nPolicy says we act in a certain way,\nwe do a certain thing at a certain time.\n\n317\n00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:11.580\nAnd I get that you have\nan immediate sense about this, but\n\n318\n00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.500\nI'm going to have to deny you that,\nthat's how we fight against it.\n\n319\n00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.715\n>> What if I took out\nyour email server and\n\n320\n00:21:16.715 --> 00:21:22.640\neverybody's complaining and\nwe got to get up, you know what I mean?\n\n321\n00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.850\nAnd I appear, I show up,\nhey I'm here to fix it.\n\n322\n00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.540\nSomebody told me to come in.\n\n323\n00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.790\n>> Well now we have the value on the time.\n\n324\n00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.030\nThat's not you putting value on the time,\n\n325\n00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:36.630\nthere is a real value to the time that-\n>> I forced it.\n\n326\n00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:37.670\n>> Yeah, you forced that hand, right.\n\n327\n00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:38.470\n>> I forced it, yeah.\n\n328\n00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.190\nRight, so it's just another way\nto really play that time factor.\n\n329\n00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:45.120\nAnother big one is social proof.\n\n330\n00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:45.910\n>> Mm.\n\n331\n00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:50.040\n>> If everybody else is doing\nit then I must be doing it.\n\n332\n00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:55.940\nOne of the first animations we did the kid\nafter he couldn't get his Happy Meal.\n\n333\n00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:01.210\nWas kind of like everybody else has one,\nwhy can't I.\n\n334\n00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:05.100\nAnd it's an important one and\nit really gets people to move.\n\n335\n00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.940\nBecause everybody really\nwants to be normal.\n\n336\n00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.960\nYou know, we all wanna do what a normal\nperson does, how do you behave?\n\n337\n00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.390\nCan you influence people to behave\nin a certain way simply by saying,\n\n338\n00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.190\nwell this is really the accepted behavior?\n\n339\n00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.750\n>> Now Tom,\n\n340\n00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:21.350\nif all your friends were jumping off\na cliff, would you jump off a cliff, too?\n\n341\n00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:22.950\nObviously, that was the first\nthing that jumped to my head.\n\n342\n00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:26.570\n>> It would depend what we're getting paid\nto jump off for, you know what I mean?\n\n343\n00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:27.830\n>> Exactly.\n\n344\n00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:33.270\nYeah, Tom would come up and say,\nI'm gonna get one of them flying costumes.\n\n345\n00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.370\n>> I'm jumping off.\n\n346\n00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:35.200\n>> All right.\n\n347\n00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:44.150\nSo there was one survivor of\nthe Jimmy Jones Massacre.\n\n348\n00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:50.280\nAnd a woman was smart enough\nto refuse the whole offering,\n\n349\n00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.330\nshe really got out of there.\n\n350\n00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:52.970\nOne survivor.\n\n351\n00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:58.602\nSo everybody else sucked up and\nsocial proof.\n\n352\n00:22:58.602 --> 00:23:03.710\n>> Yeah, everybody else was doing it, that\nwas the consensus that we should do this.\n\n353\n00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:06.230\nAnd therefore they partook\nin poisoned Kool-Aid.\n\n354\n00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:10.510\n>> If you violate the rule,\nthen you're an outcast.\n\n355\n00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:14.984\nYou're a deviant, you're an outlier.\n\n356\n00:23:14.984 --> 00:23:16.790\nThe rule can't work in reverse.\n\n357\n00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.700\nGiving something without\nallowing something in return.\n\n358\n00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.390\nYou know, like, I give you a gift then\nyou want to give me something back and\n\n359\n00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.220\nI don't want it.\n\n360\n00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.260\nIt's okay.\n\n361\n00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:37.845\nThat can be just as turn-off as\nthe fact that I didn't give you a gift.\n\n362\n00:23:37.845 --> 00:23:40.995\nI'm a cheapskate now,\nwhy won't you accept my little offer here,\n\n363\n00:23:40.995 --> 00:23:41.999\nyou know what I mean?\n\n364\n00:23:41.999 --> 00:23:46.281\nCome on.\n\n365\n00:23:46.281 --> 00:23:47.909\nYou gave me something.\n\n366\n00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:53.560\nI'm sorry,\nI don't want to give you anything back.\n\n367\n00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.845\nSo, that can really twist things up.\n\n368\n00:23:57.845 --> 00:24:02.233\nWe talked early about the contrast\nprinciple about the three\n\n369\n00:24:02.233 --> 00:24:06.291\nbuckets called the hot,\nthe ipsigome, and contrast.\n\n370\n00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:09.960\nWe hit contrast in a couple\ndifferent ways, with black and\n\n371\n00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.590\nwhite determines the absence of colors or\nnot.\n\n372\n00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:18.130\nDepends on your reference point and\nwhere you're coming from.\n\n373\n00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:22.840\nSometimes just the terms of in and\nout could become\n\n374\n00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:27.280\nkind of twisted up in people's minds and\nbecome dyslexic.\n\n375\n00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:33.670\nSo then we come to manipulation, okay?\n\n376\n00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:38.250\nI think the difference there\nbetween manipulation, and\n\n377\n00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:42.540\nin fact, if we could pop up this one\ngraphic that I have for this, okay?\n\n378\n00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:46.346\nIt really depends on your intent.\n\n379\n00:24:46.346 --> 00:24:50.014\nCertainly it is your intent to guide and\n\n380\n00:24:50.014 --> 00:24:54.690\ninfluence people to do something for\ntheir good.\n\n381\n00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.840\nGetting your children to bed on time or\n\n382\n00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:02.620\ngetting all your users\nto follow the policy,\n\n383\n00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:08.370\nhave good computer use, maybe not\nuse Facebook when they're at work.\n\n384\n00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:10.382\nTo be careful with your mobile devices.\n\n385\n00:25:10.382 --> 00:25:11.910\nThat kind of influence is good.\n\n386\n00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:16.831\nOn the other hand, if the intent\nis really to steal information,\n\n387\n00:25:16.831 --> 00:25:22.201\nto exfiltrate information from\nthe company, to steal contact lists,\n\n388\n00:25:22.201 --> 00:25:28.753\nto steal user lists, to steal intellectual\ninformation, then it's manipulation.\n\n389\n00:25:28.753 --> 00:25:32.358\nIt's a pretty fine line\nreally between the two.\n\n390\n00:25:32.358 --> 00:25:37.020\nYou're either on the dark path or\n\n391\n00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.740\nthe white path and on the good path.\n\n392\n00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:46.950\nSo, manipulation is certainly\nan important element in social,\n\n393\n00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:55.815\nthe root actually comes from\nmani which means hand and\n\n394\n00:25:55.815 --> 00:26:02.630\npulos Latin means to fill and\nso manipulate really is.\n\n395\n00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:07.329\nSomething to do with the hands so, the\nmanipulate big word would be manipulate by\n\n396\n00:26:07.329 --> 00:26:10.260\nbasketball manipulates the ball well.\n\n397\n00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.270\nSo manipulation in itself\nis not a bad thing.\n\n398\n00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:18.710\nBut in terms of what we're talking here,\nin terms of influence or manipulation\n\n399\n00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:25.510\nwe're gonna put manipulation\nmore into the evil side.\n\n400\n00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.040\n>> The negative side.\n>> The negative side,\n\n401\n00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.170\nnegative connotation.\n\n402\n00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:31.332\n>> All right Tom.\nWell,\n\n403\n00:26:31.332 --> 00:26:34.140\nwe have covered a lot of ground today.\n\n404\n00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:37.220\nIt influences obviously\nquite a large topic, and\n\n405\n00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.880\nthere's a lot of ways in\nwhich we can be influenced.\n\n406\n00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.530\nI think you've done a fantastic job\nof of walking us down through those\n\n407\n00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:45.670\nmany different avenues\non which influence or\n\n408\n00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:50.630\nmanipulation whatever the case may\nbe can or will be working on us.\n\n409\n00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:51.760\nAnd we've got to keep an eye on that and\n\n410\n00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.950\nnow we've been able to\nbetter spot those things.\n\n411\n00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:56.429\nMaybe even a social engineering attack.\n\n412\n00:26:56.429 --> 00:26:58.530\nTom we thank you for dropping by today.\n\n413\n00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:01.120\nIt looks like our time has come to an end.\n\n414\n00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.620\nWe appreciate it.\n\n415\n00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.710\nMaybe one day you'll write a book\ncalled the Tao of social engineering.\n\n416\n00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:08.510\n>> I like it.\n>> And all I want is credit for the title.\n\n417\n00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:10.750\n>> Thank you, that's a good title.\n\n418\n00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:11.340\n>> We have a deal.\n\n419\n00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.280\nWe have an accord.\n\n420\n00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.073\nThat being said it's time to end our show.\n\n421\n00:27:14.073 --> 00:27:15.580\nAgain thanks for stopping by.\n\n422\n00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.990\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n423\n00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.070\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n424\n00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.800\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n425\n00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.940\n>> And Tom Updegrove.\n\n426\n00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:23.757\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n427\n00:27:23.757 --> 00:27:25.750\n>> Yeah.\n\n428\n00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:30.590\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.780\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.850\nin todays episode we are continuing on\nwith our social engineering series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.564\nHopefully, you've been\nenjoying that because back for\n\n6\n00:00:24.564 --> 00:00:27.743\na little more of that action is\nour good friend Mr. Tom Updegrove.\n\n7\n00:00:27.743 --> 00:00:29.780\nTom, welcome back to the set sir,\nwe're so glad to have you.\n\n8\n00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.079\n>> Thank you, Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:38.230\nI'm thrilled to be here again for\nour seventh module.\n\n10\n00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.286\nOur tools of the trade,\nand so it's important.\n\n11\n00:00:41.286 --> 00:00:43.290\nI was saying I love power tools.\n\n12\n00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.045\nA recent acquisition is\na battery-powered nail gun.\n\n13\n00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:51.542\n>> More power.\n>> It's more power.\n\n14\n00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:56.145\nBut in everything, even when I\ngo into a martial arts analogy.\n\n15\n00:00:56.145 --> 00:01:01.010\nRight, martial artist needs to understand\nthat they could use their fingers,\n\n16\n00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.890\ntheir fists, their elbows,\nshoulder, headbutt.\n\n17\n00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.711\nThey can use the knee,\nthe hip, the whole body.\n\n18\n00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:10.630\n>> I use my face [LAUGH].\n\n19\n00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.510\n>> The foot,\nsometimes people use their face.\n\n20\n00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.860\nAnd that's a good one to use.\n\n21\n00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.890\nIt's a good one to use.\n\n22\n00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.510\nMaybe don't block with your face, though.\n\n23\n00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.230\nI wouldn't do that.\n\n24\n00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.210\n>> Yeah, see that's my problem.\n\n25\n00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.500\nI've been blocking with my face.\n\n26\n00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.600\n>> Yeah, yeah, I doubt it.\n\n27\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.320\n>> I knew there was something wrong,\nright.\n\n28\n00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.829\nSo, tools today, right?\n\n29\n00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:28.300\nThat's what we're going on.\n>> So, tools are, yeah,\n\n30\n00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.630\ntools are important.\n\n31\n00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.918\nCertainly in social engineering,\n\n32\n00:01:31.918 --> 00:01:35.355\nwe've looked at all\nthe psychological components.\n\n33\n00:01:35.355 --> 00:01:39.985\nBut really, there are three basic vectors\n\n34\n00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:44.500\nthat social engineering is utilized in.\n\n35\n00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.670\nWe know, person to person,\nthat the exploits are there.\n\n36\n00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.820\nAnd, I think person to person is probably\nthe most difficult, because there's so\n\n37\n00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.850\nmany different components in there, that\nyou really need to be able to pretext and\n\n38\n00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.370\nunderstand.\n\n39\n00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.981\nAnd you may be more apt to cold call\nsomebody, if you use the phone.\n\n40\n00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:09.770\nYou may not have to dress up, even\nthough we talked about that yesterday,\n\n41\n00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.636\nabout dressing the part, putting on\nthe costume, going through the whole\n\n42\n00:02:14.636 --> 00:02:19.350\nritual of getting into that acting mode,\njust like an actor would.\n\n43\n00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.060\nAnd I think that your success\nwith that would be better.\n\n44\n00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.720\nBut next to face to face,\nwe have the telephone.\n\n45\n00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.270\nTelephone, widely used.\n\n46\n00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.376\nCertainly, it's a great vehicle.\n\n47\n00:02:33.376 --> 00:02:41.740\nWe're bombarded, I know myself, I get\nspam calls for just about everything.\n\n48\n00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.420\nSometimes they're legitimate,\nmost of the time they're not.\n\n49\n00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.410\nAnd then a few mobile devices.\n\n50\n00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.898\nOr through the computer,\nwe're getting our email.\n\n51\n00:02:52.898 --> 00:02:58.515\nBut [INAUDIBLE] device,\nI think today, what's happening\n\n52\n00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:03.443\neven more so is the SMS and\nmedia messaging vector,\n\n53\n00:03:03.443 --> 00:03:08.617\nthat is only beginning to\nbe exploited at this point.\n\n54\n00:03:08.617 --> 00:03:12.513\n>> So, in it's infancy as it were\n>> Yes, infancy.\n\n55\n00:03:12.513 --> 00:03:16.080\n>> I expect, because everybody's\ntied to their device of always\n\n56\n00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.460\ngetting text messages,\nalways contacting people.\n\n57\n00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.060\nAnd through that medium a whole lot\nmore than I did five years ago.\n\n58\n00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.346\nAnd, yeah, now that it's becoming\na vehicle for communication, more so\n\n59\n00:03:27.346 --> 00:03:29.810\nthan it ever has before,\npeople are gonna work at that.\n\n60\n00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.677\n>> Sure, because you're gonna have\nyour computer with you all the time,\n\n61\n00:03:33.677 --> 00:03:34.970\nyou have it 24/7.\n\n62\n00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.370\nAs I ride the trains, I see everybody\nsitting there going through it.\n\n63\n00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.850\nSo, you can, boom,\nhit millions of people at once.\n\n64\n00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.425\nOne simple message.\n\n65\n00:03:48.425 --> 00:03:52.757\nSo we have a little video, a little\nanimation that we've kind of put together\n\n66\n00:03:52.757 --> 00:03:55.200\nfor this, called Tools of the Trade.\n\n67\n00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.550\nAnd if we could roll that now, gives\nyou a great start, and roll into this.\n\n68\n00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.560\n>> From the information\nsecurity perspective,\n\n69\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.750\nsocial engineering attacks refer to\nan attack exploiting human weakness, or\n\n70\n00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.800\ncheating people into\ndisclosing personal or\n\n71\n00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.660\nsensitive information, such as bank\naccount numbers or personal passwords.\n\n72\n00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.960\n>> I often use my birthday\nas my personal password.\n\n73\n00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.280\nHow about you?\n\n74\n00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.750\n>> Well, I use my pet's name instead.\n\n75\n00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.800\n>> The following are some typical\nexamples of social engineering attacks.\n\n76\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.380\nThe attacker impersonates the senior\nexecutive of an organization in calling\n\n77\n00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.560\nthe staff of the internal IT support team.\n\n78\n00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.020\nThe social engineer requests the staff\nto resent the log in password for\n\n79\n00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.500\nthe senior executive, and\nto give the new password to the attacker.\n\n80\n00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.505\nAnd with the new password, [SOUND] some\nnegligent staff may dispose of documents\n\n81\n00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:47.922\nor storage media containing sensitive\ninformation in the trash bin.\n\n82\n00:04:47.922 --> 00:04:52.176\nThis gives the attacker an opportunity to\nretrieve useful information easily from\n\n83\n00:04:52.176 --> 00:04:56.960\nthe trash and further attack the\norganization's internal computer network.\n\n84\n00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.660\nSome attackers will send\nout fraudulent emails.\n\n85\n00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.650\nRecipients who trust the content of these\nmessages will follow the instructions,\n\n86\n00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.530\nenter poisoned websites, and\nkey in sensitive information.\n\n87\n00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.589\nThen, the attacker can easily use this\ninformation for further illegal purposes.\n\n88\n00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.000\nAttackers can also steal\ninformation simply by peeping.\n\n89\n00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.890\nFor example,\nthe attacker may stand near a user and\n\n90\n00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.860\npeep at the password while\nthey're being entered.\n\n91\n00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.310\nAttackers will also try to guess according\nto the tendency of habits of the user\n\n92\n00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.089\nsuch as name, address, and date of birth.\n\n93\n00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.428\n>> That was a funny one, that Peter, he\nis a creative young man, that's for sure.\n\n94\n00:05:35.428 --> 00:05:37.799\n>> That's great!\n\n95\n00:05:37.799 --> 00:05:42.668\nSo, in a sense,\nhere we've got person to person,\n\n96\n00:05:42.668 --> 00:05:47.653\ntype thing, but\nwe can see that they were extracting\n\n97\n00:05:47.653 --> 00:05:53.270\nemail passwords and\neven mobile device aspect vectors.\n\n98\n00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.460\nSo email being one of the big ones.\n\n99\n00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.170\nWhat we have together,\nI planned for you is a little lab,\n\n100\n00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.275\nwhich will take us through\na program called Cobalt Strike.\n\n101\n00:06:06.275 --> 00:06:11.635\nSo Cobalt Strike could run in a number\nof different Linux environments.\n\n102\n00:06:11.635 --> 00:06:16.702\nI've run it in a Mac environment, but\nI'm gonna run it in a Kali Linux.\n\n103\n00:06:16.702 --> 00:06:21.762\nAnd so there's a few steps that I\nhave to go through to bring that up.\n\n104\n00:06:22.972 --> 00:06:28.128\nAnd so first of which is,\nI've got to start my\n\n105\n00:06:28.128 --> 00:06:33.590\nPostgreSQL server,\n\n106\n00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:40.430\nwhich will contain most of the data, and\nthen there's a Metasploit back end to it.\n\n107\n00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.070\nAre you familiar with Metasploit?\n\n108\n00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.590\n>> I am familiar with Metasploit, yes.\n\n109\n00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.990\n>> I mean, really fantastic tool.\n\n110\n00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.970\nMetasploit alone, really you could do it,\nbut people have started to develop\n\n111\n00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.460\ntools that will help integrate and\ngive you a better, maybe a GUI interface.\n\n112\n00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.500\nSo you don't have to really run\ntoo much command line stuff.\n\n113\n00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:04.680\nOkay so what I have here is a little\nvirtual network that I'm running.\n\n114\n00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:10.970\nI've got a development hypervisor\nthat I f run these things in,\n\n115\n00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.390\nand one of the VMs that\nit have is Kali Linux.\n\n116\n00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.484\nKali Linux,\nI've already got open already, but\n\n117\n00:07:19.484 --> 00:07:23.112\nI want you to see some\nof the initial things.\n\n118\n00:07:23.112 --> 00:07:27.655\nSo here, basically,\nKali Linux has just opened up, and\n\n119\n00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:30.860\nI've got to open up a terminal.\n\n120\n00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.240\nI've got to start a couple\nof services first.\n\n121\n00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.820\nThings don't initially start up.\n\n122\n00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.414\nSo first is the PostgreSQL, so\n\n123\n00:07:39.414 --> 00:07:44.363\ntype Service Post ERE SQL start,\n\n124\n00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:48.263\nand let that thing run up.\n\n125\n00:07:50.222 --> 00:07:54.935\nYou have to spell service correctly.\n\n126\n00:07:54.935 --> 00:07:55.945\n>> It usually helps.\n\n127\n00:07:55.945 --> 00:07:56.795\n>> It's usually good.\n\n128\n00:07:56.795 --> 00:08:01.307\nOkay, there we go, and then Metasploit.\n\n129\n00:08:01.307 --> 00:08:04.820\nMetasploit, really,\nis the back-end for this tool, for\n\n130\n00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.726\nthis version of Cobalt Strike.\n\n131\n00:08:06.726 --> 00:08:09.239\nLatest version,\nyou've actually removed it.\n\n132\n00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:14.857\nBut you could find\nthe component in Armitage,\n\n133\n00:08:14.857 --> 00:08:21.926\nwhich is written by the same tool author,\nRaphael Mudge.\n\n134\n00:08:21.926 --> 00:08:23.685\nSo.\n\n135\n00:08:29.226 --> 00:08:29.888\nAnd we start that.\n\n136\n00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:33.772\nGood, those things happened to be open.\n\n137\n00:08:33.772 --> 00:08:37.720\nI've got a directory where\nthe tool actually runs.\n\n138\n00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:43.450\nSo I'm gonna change directories\nto Cobalt Strike, and\n\n139\n00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:48.492\nthen simply start Cobalt Strike.\n\n140\n00:08:48.492 --> 00:08:51.030\nNow this thing takes a little while to do.\n\n141\n00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:55.110\nIt's gonna probably take three,\nfour minutes to open up.\n\n142\n00:08:55.110 --> 00:09:00.240\nSo we're gonna kinda time out right here,\ncome back in as soon as this thing starts\n\n143\n00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.980\nup, but just pay attention just for\nthese two areas.\n\n144\n00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.580\nSo, one, you will get a message.\n\n145\n00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.631\nThis happens to be a trial version that\nwas quite extended to 49,504 days.\n\n146\n00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:14.533\nSo, I think my trial might run for\na while.\n\n147\n00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:16.602\n>> You got a few days.\n\n148\n00:09:16.602 --> 00:09:17.252\n>> Yeah.\n\n149\n00:09:17.252 --> 00:09:22.388\nDo connect, and\nit's telling me that the cserv\n\n150\n00:09:22.388 --> 00:09:26.552\nisn't running, so I'll let that start up.\n\n151\n00:09:26.552 --> 00:09:29.816\nThe next thing you do,\nis you'll see this connection here, and\n\n152\n00:09:29.816 --> 00:09:31.516\nit'll say connection refused.\n\n153\n00:09:31.516 --> 00:09:35.820\nAnd even if you've started working with\nArmitage, at first you'll go well,\n\n154\n00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:40.070\nthis tool isn't working, I mean that\nthing's just laying here, loading.\n\n155\n00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:41.540\nIt takes a while, okay.\n\n156\n00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:47.160\nSo we're gonna cut here, we'll come\nback in a few minutes once it's up.\n\n157\n00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.293\nSo, hence,\nyou see that my tool is up and running.\n\n158\n00:09:49.293 --> 00:09:53.831\nSo, the interesting thing about\nCobalt Strike, the way it works,\n\n159\n00:09:53.831 --> 00:09:58.820\nis it has these listeners, and so,\nyou go down to that Listener tab.\n\n160\n00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.987\nAnd, in this case, I don't have any\nlisteners made, but I'm going to use\n\n161\n00:10:02.987 --> 00:10:06.507\na couple specific listeners here,\nso, I click on the Add tab.\n\n162\n00:10:06.507 --> 00:10:08.808\nAnd, at first,\nI'm gonna make a Windows lister,\n\n163\n00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:10.637\nokay, it's gonna be a Windows beacon.\n\n164\n00:10:10.637 --> 00:10:15.596\nSo, Windows_Listen,\nit's just a vanity plate,\n\n165\n00:10:15.596 --> 00:10:19.990\na name,\nyou can call it whatever you want, but\n\n166\n00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:26.977\nyou can see here that you have quite\na few types of beacons that you can use,\n\n167\n00:10:26.977 --> 00:10:32.069\nand I'm going to use the HTTP,\nreverse HTTP beacon.\n\n168\n00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:38.585\nThis 10.1.10.2, that's the IP\naddress of my virtual machine here,\n\n169\n00:10:38.585 --> 00:10:44.320\nand I'm going to use port 80,\nwhich is the typical web port.\n\n170\n00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.530\nThis automatic migrate session,\n\n171\n00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.770\nthis actually will migrate\nit into another service.\n\n172\n00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.475\nSo that, even though it's running,\n\n173\n00:10:52.475 --> 00:10:55.365\nit won't look the same when you\nkind of check through services.\n\n174\n00:10:55.365 --> 00:10:59.894\nThat's a typical kind of migration\ntrick that you do with Metasploit.\n\n175\n00:10:59.894 --> 00:11:04.610\nOkay, move it into Task Manager or\nsomething like that, yeah?\n\n176\n00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.080\nIt looks like it should be here, right?\n\n177\n00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.440\nSo I save that.\n\n178\n00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.151\nIt's just asking me to confirm\nthat the input is that, and\n\n179\n00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:13.751\nI wanna create one more.\n\n180\n00:11:13.751 --> 00:11:19.758\nI wanna create a Java listener,\na HTTPS listener, okay.\n\n181\n00:11:19.758 --> 00:11:24.625\nSo I'm gonna call this\nJava_listen as well.\n\n182\n00:11:24.625 --> 00:11:31.218\nI scroll down towards the bottom\nof the page, you'll see my Java,\n\n183\n00:11:31.218 --> 00:11:36.870\nso this is actually gonna be\na Java interpreter HTTP, and\n\n184\n00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:42.430\nI'm gonna give it an indiscriminate port,\n4444.\n\n185\n00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.574\nAnd I'm gonna let that automatically\nmigrate as well, okay?\n\n186\n00:11:51.056 --> 00:11:51.712\nHello?\n\n187\n00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:56.284\nThere we go.\n\n188\n00:12:01.727 --> 00:12:04.574\nOkay, I didn't like that warning.\n\n189\n00:12:04.574 --> 00:12:07.786\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It said that the port was actually in\n\n190\n00:12:07.786 --> 00:12:08.970\nuse, already.\n\n191\n00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:15.460\nSo when that happens,\nyou've gotta go back, stop the service,\n\n192\n00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.240\nrestart the service.\n\n193\n00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.670\nWe're not gonna, we're gonna push ahead,\nsee if we can make this thing work.\n\n194\n00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.630\nAll right so\nI've got my two listeners, right?\n\n195\n00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:28.170\nSo that helps me now to go to the next\nphase in the attack which I'm gonna make\n\n196\n00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:32.410\nthis a web drive-by attack,\nI'm gonna create a website.\n\n197\n00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:40.610\nThat web server that I'm going\nto put a link into my e-mail,\n\n198\n00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:47.880\nsend that out to my subjects,\nhave them open email normally.\n\n199\n00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.140\nYeah, click on it.\n\n200\n00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.380\nSomething enticing, right?\n\n201\n00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.990\nIt should be something either immediate,\n\n202\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.780\nokay, something that nabs,\npulls on their greed, okay?\n\n203\n00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.270\nCertainly, urgency is an important part,\nbut\n\n204\n00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:07.470\nsomething also that grabs their attention.\n\n205\n00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:11.580\n>> So this is really where our social\nengineering skills come into play.\n\n206\n00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.450\nThis is what's gonna get us,\nthis is the bait.\n\n207\n00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.700\n>> You've gotta be\na creative director really.\n\n208\n00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:22.300\nYou gotta think you're\nselling the latest and\n\n209\n00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:26.780\ngreatest automobile or motorcycle.\n\n210\n00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:31.640\nIn this case, I like motorcycles, so\nI like to use motorcycles as a thing.\n\n211\n00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.750\nHey, man, check out this really cool ride.\n\n212\n00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.418\nSo here in Cobalt Strike,\nwe have what we call the web driveby.\n\n213\n00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:41.220\nI'm gonna use this auto-exploit server.\n\n214\n00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:48.515\nYou'll see this often when you\nget kind of a phishing email.\n\n215\n00:13:48.515 --> 00:13:50.128\nYou'll see a little link in there.\n\n216\n00:13:50.128 --> 00:13:56.521\nUsually it comes from somebody you know,\nwhose address book has gotten ripped off,\n\n217\n00:13:56.521 --> 00:14:01.396\nand yeah, it would be something\nreally has no relevance to you.\n\n218\n00:14:01.396 --> 00:14:06.097\nOn the other hand if you do make a rub and\nusing the URL in that link is kind\n\n219\n00:14:06.097 --> 00:14:09.312\nof obscure when you roll\nover it you'll see it.\n\n220\n00:14:09.312 --> 00:14:15.006\nI'm going to remove the irrelevance,\nthis is just kind of like a self-generated\n\n221\n00:14:15.006 --> 00:14:19.542\nattachment, but if I roll this all\nthe way back just to the slash,\n\n222\n00:14:19.542 --> 00:14:23.587\nbasic advantage's gonna be port AD,\nwith no extension,\n\n223\n00:14:23.587 --> 00:14:27.733\ncontrol ports, port 80,\nthe attack port's 8080.\n\n224\n00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:32.401\nExploit list is, I would leave it at\ndefault, but you can see that my listeners\n\n225\n00:14:32.401 --> 00:14:36.320\nthat I just created actually\nalready rolled up in there, okay?\n\n226\n00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.174\nSo, hence, I hit Launch,\nand what will happen is\n\n227\n00:14:41.174 --> 00:14:46.490\nthis gives me a URL that I\nwanna put in the actual email,\n\n228\n00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:51.246\nand so, I hit that and\nit starts up my web server.\n\n229\n00:14:57.232 --> 00:15:01.458\nOkay, so now, I wanna get my victims.\n\n230\n00:15:01.458 --> 00:15:06.478\nOkay, so I've done my research already,\nI know who I'm after.\n\n231\n00:15:06.478 --> 00:15:12.050\nI know there's this company\ncalled Morning Catch, and\n\n232\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:17.470\nI even got a couple names and emails that\nI've been able to harvest out of their\n\n233\n00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:23.440\nwebsite, and they're my specific victims,\nright, like targets.\n\n234\n00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.329\nSo hence, I go down to the Spear Phishing\nmodule, I open that up.\n\n235\n00:15:28.329 --> 00:15:34.302\nIt just so happens,\nyou see here that the targets\n\n236\n00:15:34.302 --> 00:15:39.400\nis this file here and\nif I show you in my home\n\n237\n00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.660\nfolder I have a targets file,\nI open it up.\n\n238\n00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.007\nSimply, it's really just a text file.\n\n239\n00:15:46.007 --> 00:15:50.357\nIt's not even comma separated,\nbut just tab separated,\n\n240\n00:15:50.357 --> 00:15:54.720\nwith the name of the person as\nwell as their email address.\n\n241\n00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.539\nI could make a list of 50 people.\n\n242\n00:15:56.539 --> 00:16:00.279\nIn fact, as a pen tester,\nthat's how you use a tool like this,\n\n243\n00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:04.675\nyou'll get a list of all the users and\nyou'll start sending them emails.\n\n244\n00:16:04.675 --> 00:16:07.999\nAnd then you should be getting some\nresults back from it as to who opened and\n\n245\n00:16:07.999 --> 00:16:08.651\nwho didn't.\n\n246\n00:16:08.651 --> 00:16:11.815\nSo, therefore,\nnow you have a report, you know,\n\n247\n00:16:11.815 --> 00:16:15.434\nas to Jimmy Bond opened it\nup when he shouldn't have.\n\n248\n00:16:15.434 --> 00:16:18.009\nSo it helps you to really\n\n249\n00:16:21.236 --> 00:16:25.657\nProbe, get responses, remediate,\n\n250\n00:16:25.657 --> 00:16:30.490\nresolve, and further probe again.\n\n251\n00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.730\nSo we don't need that.\n\n252\n00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.470\nAs well, I want you to look at, I've got\na couple different emails I make up.\n\n253\n00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.680\nI want you to look at my attacking email.\n\n254\n00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:44.990\nSo this was actually a Gmail\nmessage that was sent to Jimmy,\n\n255\n00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:48.600\nJimmy 007, Jimmy Bond.\n\n256\n00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:53.550\nWe got a message before,\n\n257\n00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.560\nbut you could take any email here,\nsimply grab all the headers,\n\n258\n00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:02.920\ntake all the content of it and\nput it in a text file.\n\n259\n00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.552\nAnd then you take that text file and\nyou add it Into\n\n260\n00:17:07.552 --> 00:17:14.210\nthe actual email spear phishing program.\n\n261\n00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.310\nSo let's close this up.\n\n262\n00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:20.460\nOkay?\nSo Here I click on my templates, and\n\n263\n00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:24.560\nI know that my template would\nbe this motorcycle email.\n\n264\n00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.760\nOkay?\nSo I want to preview it.\n\n265\n00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:33.165\nThat's kind of what it looks at, but\nbasically it's gonna give a little,\n\n266\n00:17:33.165 --> 00:17:35.211\nyou're gonna see that\nthe link sits in here.\n\n267\n00:17:38.426 --> 00:17:41.050\nCheck out my motorcycle, Jimmy Bond.\n\n268\n00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.400\nAnd down here,\n\n269\n00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:49.160\nyou see where we got the links sitting\ndown under next to the bottom line, right?\n\n270\n00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.340\nOkay, so\nthat's basically what it looks like.\n\n271\n00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.750\nI could preview it in HTML.\n\n272\n00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:00.500\nThat's what it's gonna look\nlike when they get it, okay?\n\n273\n00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:05.520\nNaturally, if the purchase is not so\nsmart, you're not gonna check it.\n\n274\n00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.910\nYou're gonna impulsively go on.\n\n275\n00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.232\nThat's the way the click goes.\n\n276\n00:18:09.232 --> 00:18:14.210\nRight, so I close that and off I go.\n\n277\n00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.720\nNow these other lines here,\nI could add an attachment and\n\n278\n00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:23.120\nthat could be some type of poison\nattachment when they open that up.\n\n279\n00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.960\nSo maybe the body email would be clean but\nthe attachment would have something.\n\n280\n00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:34.150\nIt could be a malformed PDF or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n281\n00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:38.534\nDue to the background research I did,\nI realized the level of patching that\n\n282\n00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:41.470\nthey've done, the capabilities\nto receive the vulnerabilities.\n\n283\n00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.810\nI already know exactly how to\ncraft that and send that out.\n\n284\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:49.290\nMaybe it's a zero day, that you just\nhappen to want to spend a few dollars for.\n\n285\n00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.450\nYou know, and you're after your target.\n\n286\n00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:57.410\nThe embedded URL aspect would be that\nany URLs that are in that email that I\n\n287\n00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:04.380\ngrabbed and cut out, the entire text\nof it, I could take an embedded URL,\n\n288\n00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:10.640\nthis will replace all the URLs with the\nsame link so no matter where they click,\n\n289\n00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.419\nit'll say one thing, but\nit's gonna wind up being another.\n\n290\n00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:18.320\nHence, next step, attack.\n\n291\n00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.130\nSo I send that off.\n\n292\n00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:24.120\nAs we can see down in the bottom here,\nit's preparing to send them now.\n\n293\n00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.986\nWe were successfully sending one to Jimmy.\n\n294\n00:19:30.925 --> 00:19:32.468\nLooks like Bob got one.\n\n295\n00:19:37.066 --> 00:19:38.638\nLooks like Alice got one.\n\n296\n00:19:38.638 --> 00:19:41.930\nSo they're saying that it was successfully\nsent or that they got in open-\n\n297\n00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.220\n>> Successfully sent.\n\n298\n00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:44.920\n>> Okay.\n\n299\n00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:51.480\n>> Which in the one working on this\nyesterday when I was playing with my VMs,\n\n300\n00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.530\nI couldn't get the email server\nto successfully send it.\n\n301\n00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.000\nJust kept me a relay here.\n\n302\n00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.710\nHence I'm using my back up system here.\n\n303\n00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:08.020\nOkay, so this is all sitting here\nwaiting for something to happen.\n\n304\n00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:13.060\nNow we have,\nwe want to go to our environment.\n\n305\n00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:18.380\nWe've got Alice up here who uses this,\nshe works in the compliance department\n\n306\n00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:25.190\nin New York, and\nit's her obligation to make sure that\n\n307\n00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:31.730\nall the policies are met,\nshe deals with that aspect of it.\n\n308\n00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:35.520\nAlice also happens to run Window 7, okay.\n\n309\n00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.253\nShe's logged into her system,\nbut she wants to check her email.\n\n310\n00:20:42.855 --> 00:20:49.370\nOkay, so in this case her email is going\nto be right here, this 10.1.10.15.\n\n311\n00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:54.257\nNaturally, it would be a real email server\n\n312\n00:20:54.257 --> 00:20:58.329\nthat someone would be going to, but\n\n313\n00:20:58.329 --> 00:21:04.439\nin this case I'm using\na program called Morning Catch\n\n314\n00:21:04.439 --> 00:21:09.327\nspecifically designed as a mail server for\n\n315\n00:21:09.327 --> 00:21:13.672\nthese types of phishing expedition,\n\n316\n00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:17.908\nexpeditionary training examples.\n\n317\n00:21:17.908 --> 00:21:25.690\nSo Her machine's running a little slow.\n\n318\n00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.330\nWe don't need to subscribe to any links.\n\n319\n00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.590\nOkay, so Alice wants to login, so, Alice.\n\n320\n00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:39.280\nAnd I know Alice's password because\nI am secretly Alice in another life.\n\n321\n00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.640\nBear with me,\nthe machines are running a little slow.\n\n322\n00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:52.905\nGoing over the wireless here to\na server out in the Netherlands,\n\n323\n00:21:52.905 --> 00:21:57.353\nand it's all, they're all VMs.\n\n324\n00:22:00.709 --> 00:22:01.750\nCome on, Alice.\n\n325\n00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.890\n>> Alice is now making a help desk call.\n\n326\n00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:07.040\n[LAUGH]\n>> What the heck, you know?\n\n327\n00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:07.810\nMy machine.\n\n328\n00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.620\nI can help you very much.\n\n329\n00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:17.360\nI have, I can offer you\n\n330\n00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.082\na Microsoft support for minimal amount.\n\n331\n00:22:22.082 --> 00:22:27.309\n>> $200.\n>> $200, all right so\n\n332\n00:22:27.309 --> 00:22:30.375\nbear with us.\n\n333\n00:22:33.696 --> 00:22:38.071\nThere you go, so\nAlice did log into our email account and\n\n334\n00:22:38.071 --> 00:22:42.926\nheck here's the friendly little\nemail that Alice received.\n\n335\n00:22:45.272 --> 00:22:48.960\nOpening up,\nit looks just like what we did, right?\n\n336\n00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:55.040\nSo Alice goes, I love awesome machines!\n\n337\n00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.579\nAnd I love cool things so\nI'm gonna click on this.\n\n338\n00:23:01.457 --> 00:23:02.430\nWhere's the machine?\n\n339\n00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.860\nNow what's really cool in that I'm\njust throwing an example out here.\n\n340\n00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.090\nI could throw a machine.\n\n341\n00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.714\nWe could have put in Password or\nPictionary, clicked on it and\n\n342\n00:23:11.714 --> 00:23:13.260\nboom this is great.\n\n343\n00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.280\nNow, I have no idea I just\nsee loading right now but\n\n344\n00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.600\nif that picture popped up you wouldn't\neven pay attention to what's going on.\n\n345\n00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.280\nBecause what's happening is there\nis a DLL loading in the background.\n\n346\n00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:31.997\nSo hence we kind of roll\nback to our colony machine,\n\n347\n00:23:31.997 --> 00:23:37.075\ncolony machine just closed.\n\n348\n00:23:40.012 --> 00:23:44.300\nNo worry, let's open it up again.\n\n349\n00:23:54.684 --> 00:24:03.246\nAnd you notice now Alice's\nmachine is in my window.\n\n350\n00:24:03.246 --> 00:24:09.944\nNow if you're a Mantis 1 freak,\nhere's where all the stuff happens, see.\n\n351\n00:24:09.944 --> 00:24:13.830\nYou can do a scan of services,\nI could run, just run here.\n\n352\n00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:19.260\nAt this point, what I do is,\nI scan the machine, I start to find\n\n353\n00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:24.380\nout what services are running,\nwhich ones are vulnerable.\n\n354\n00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.750\nI start to put together my attack plan,\nfrom this point.\n\n355\n00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:33.020\nI'm not going to go that far with it\nbecause that's not the nature of it.\n\n356\n00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:38.070\nI just want you to see type of pen\ntesting tools that are out there.\n\n357\n00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:42.640\nThis takes us into another level of actual\nmachine hacking which is really cool I\n\n358\n00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:47.420\nmean I love doing this stuff so\nhope you kinda enjoy it.\n\n359\n00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.160\n>> Yeah this is social engineering and\n\n360\n00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.880\nthat was the social engineering\nportion of it right there.\n\n361\n00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.802\nYeah, we do use tools, we're gonna use\ntechnical expertise of some way, shape or\n\n362\n00:24:56.802 --> 00:24:59.506\nform, we have to be familiar\nwith these types of things.\n\n363\n00:24:59.506 --> 00:25:05.250\nBut the crafting of the email is what's\nspecific to our topic today, right?\n\n364\n00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.920\nThe making something appealing enough,\nthat someone will go,\n\n365\n00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.560\nwell that looks interesting, I want to\nknow more, I do want to follow this link.\n\n366\n00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:19.100\nAnd obviously we've all seen\nthe various ways in which that is done.\n\n367\n00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.420\nWe all receive spam, and\nif you ever peruse through your spam mail,\n\n368\n00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.180\n99% of it is please click on this link so\nyou'll install this back door.\n\n369\n00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:31.650\n>> Well, and we're really good at it,\nwe're all well trained on how to avoid it,\n\n370\n00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.030\nbut there's exceptions.\n\n371\n00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.260\n>> Always.\n>> Exceptions everything and\n\n372\n00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.050\nI don't care who you are,\nyou're gonna fall for it, I know I do.\n\n373\n00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:42.590\n>> And it's really, for the cracker out\nthere, the black cat, it's a numbers game.\n\n374\n00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:46.620\nThey send out enough of these things,\nthey're gonna get x amount of responses\n\n375\n00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.760\nand now they have control\nof x amount of machines.\n\n376\n00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.567\n>> Sure.\n>> And they use that as their launching\n\n377\n00:25:50.567 --> 00:25:53.409\npad for distributed analysis services or\nstealing of information,\n\n378\n00:25:53.409 --> 00:25:54.490\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n379\n00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:58.170\nAnd it was all through\nthe social engineering\n\n380\n00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:00.640\nthat they used inside of their base.\n\n381\n00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.020\n>> So that you would latch on to it and\ntake a hold.\n\n382\n00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.450\n>> I think it's the same\nthing really goes.\n\n383\n00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:08.870\nThe same kind of statistics with\nthat go with just advertisement.\n\n384\n00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.020\nWhat percentage really goes back?\n\n385\n00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.470\nWith mailers,\nhow many people respond to it?\n\n386\n00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.290\nYeah with email,\ntrue email advertisements,\n\n387\n00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.990\nhow many people respond to it?\n\n388\n00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:21.460\nIt's what catches your interests,\n\n389\n00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:25.620\nhow they play on all those\ninfluences that we talked about.\n\n390\n00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.800\n>> My dad, again I bring him up,\nhe's so funny,\n\n391\n00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.015\nhe's influencing this entire show for me.\n\n392\n00:26:30.015 --> 00:26:32.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He yells at commercials all the time.\n\n393\n00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.640\nHe hates commercials,\nwhy do they say this, why do they do that?\n\n394\n00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.930\nAnd I said, dad,\nbecause it's making them money.\n\n395\n00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:38.680\nOtherwise, they wouldn't do it.\n\n396\n00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.570\nIt does work on x amount of people.\n\n397\n00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:44.550\n>> Or they get people sitting back and\ngoing, why do they this?\n\n398\n00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:45.190\n>> Yeah, yeah, exactly.\n\n399\n00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:49.550\n>> Because it starts a whole conversation\nand mental process that sticks there,\n\n400\n00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:51.260\nit irritates them,\nwhatever it sticks there.\n\n401\n00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.660\nYou may love it, you may hate it,\nyou made an impression.\n\n402\n00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.500\n>> Exactly.\n\n403\n00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.430\nAll right, Tom.\n\n404\n00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:00.615\nUnfortunately, our clock has ticked\ndown to the zero mark, yet again.\n\n405\n00:27:00.615 --> 00:27:01.205\n>> Yeah.\n>> But\n\n406\n00:27:01.205 --> 00:27:03.385\nwe've got some more cool tools to go over.\n\n407\n00:27:03.385 --> 00:27:04.755\n>> Yeah, we've got another cool lab and\n\n408\n00:27:04.755 --> 00:27:07.825\nsome things to finish up here\nin terms of tools of the trade.\n\n409\n00:27:07.825 --> 00:27:11.105\n>> Awesome, so, another one of our\nfamous part two's are in the future.\n\n410\n00:27:11.105 --> 00:27:12.495\nHopefully we'll see you guys there.\n\n411\n00:27:12.495 --> 00:27:15.145\nAs for this episode, though,\nwe're gonna go ahead and close it down.\n\n412\n00:27:15.145 --> 00:27:17.895\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n413\n00:27:17.895 --> 00:27:19.085\n>> And Tom Updegrove.\n\n414\n00:27:19.085 --> 00:27:21.582\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n415\n00:27:21.582 --> 00:27:29.150\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.257 --> 00:00:18.035\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\n\n4\n00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:22.210\nand in today's episode we continue\non with more social engineering.\n\n5\n00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.490\nJoining us back in the studio again for\n\n6\n00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.200\na part two on the tools of the trade\nis our good friend, Mr Tom Updegrove.\n\n7\n00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.838\nTom, welcome back, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:29.838 --> 00:00:30.737\n>> Thank you, thank you, man.\n\n9\n00:00:30.737 --> 00:00:32.960\n>> Showed us a really cool\ndemo in the last segment.\n\n10\n00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.075\nLooking forward to seeing\nwhat you got in this one.\n\n11\n00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:38.480\n>> Okay, so\nhere we use different tool kits.\n\n12\n00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.349\nStill comes in Kali Linux It\ncould be installed in\n\n13\n00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:46.674\nany version of Linux of course but\n\n14\n00:00:46.674 --> 00:00:52.158\nthe nice thing about Kali\nthat comes pre-installed.\n\n15\n00:00:52.158 --> 00:00:57.405\nArmitage comes pre-installed,\nas well, in Kali Linux.\n\n16\n00:00:57.405 --> 00:01:00.895\nBut you'll have to really build\nthe module for Cobalt Strike.\n\n17\n00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:05.996\nSo, what we're gonna do here is use\n\n18\n00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:11.157\nSocial-Engineering Toolkit\nto create another\n\n19\n00:01:11.157 --> 00:01:16.585\ndrive by Website and\nI'm going to now use my Gmail.\n\n20\n00:01:16.585 --> 00:01:20.658\nSo I've got a couple fictitious\naccounts that I play around with,\n\n21\n00:01:20.658 --> 00:01:24.585\none is that consulting firm and\nthe other is just an individual,\n\n22\n00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:28.350\nwhich you met in the last video,\nJimmy Bond.\n\n23\n00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.000\nSo we're gonna craft an email that, again,\n\n24\n00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000\nwill say hey, come look at it, but I want\nyou to see that this is actually working.\n\n25\n00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.620\nI'm now working out to the Internet,\nout to the Cloud, and back again.\n\n26\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.140\nSo it kind of goes like this.\n\n27\n00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.702\nSo here we have a demo which\nI'm going to open up the social\n\n28\n00:01:55.702 --> 00:02:00.921\nengineering tool kit\nwhich is in Kali Linux.\n\n29\n00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:05.709\nI am going to create a Web\nserver that allows me\n\n30\n00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.993\nto create an email, send it to a person,\n\n31\n00:02:09.993 --> 00:02:17.730\nhave them click a link that will\nconnect back to that Web server.\n\n32\n00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.270\nThe email that I'm going to\nuse is gonna lure them into\n\n33\n00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.490\nlogging into their Facebook page.\n\n34\n00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.580\nAnd they'll log into Facebook,\nI'll get their username and password.\n\n35\n00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.688\nAnd oddly enough what'll\nhappen is they'll log in and\n\n36\n00:02:32.688 --> 00:02:35.373\nthen they'll get the log in again.\n\n37\n00:02:35.373 --> 00:02:37.880\nWhat the hell's wrong with my computer?\n\n38\n00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.740\nYou know what I mean?\n\n39\n00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.910\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n40\n00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.530\nSo the social engineering\ntoolkit is built in a run if\n\n41\n00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.300\nyou can install Kali Linux,\nis pretty easy, you can run on set.\n\n42\n00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.670\nSo the command, you can go with Kali, you\ncan actually go to all the applications.\n\n43\n00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.853\nYou have pull down,\nwhatever you want to run but\n\n44\n00:02:59.853 --> 00:03:05.361\nyou can also just run it right from the\ncommand line, so SeToolkit is the command.\n\n45\n00:03:05.361 --> 00:03:09.100\nAnd SeToolkit,\n\n46\n00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.110\nhelps to type it.\n\n47\n00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.340\nThe demo really for\nthis is easy as one, two, three.\n\n48\n00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.563\nOne, would be the social\nengineering a text.\n\n49\n00:03:21.563 --> 00:03:25.960\nIt's interesting to see that\nthere are a myriad of attacks.\n\n50\n00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.760\nSpear fishing attacks, website attack\nvectors, infectious media generators,\n\n51\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.664\nwhich means you can create something\nto put on a USB drive to plug in,\n\n52\n00:03:34.664 --> 00:03:37.628\nit'll create a payload that\nwill roll back to you.\n\n53\n00:03:37.628 --> 00:03:42.487\nAnd I will say that this also uses\nthe backend of Metasploit as well,\n\n54\n00:03:42.487 --> 00:03:45.820\nso that's why it works so\nwell on color Linux.\n\n55\n00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.055\nMass malware attack, if you got a lot of\npeople you wanna send out, just like that.\n\n56\n00:03:51.055 --> 00:03:54.060\nIt's not, you don't quite have\nthe same reporting features that you\n\n57\n00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.150\nhave in stuff like Cobalt Strike.\n\n58\n00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.670\nCobalt Strike is an totally\nitself a spirit fish.\n\n59\n00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.280\nHe just has a great spirit\nfishing module reporting.\n\n60\n00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.040\nArduino!\n\n61\n00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.820\nSo, some people love to play,\nkind of hobbyists.\n\n62\n00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.510\nBut, arduinos,\nyou can load them up with payloads and\n\n63\n00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.570\nplug them into a network somewhere.\n\n64\n00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.665\nUSB drive whatever.\n\n65\n00:04:18.665 --> 00:04:23.560\nWireless attacks even\na QRC code generator.\n\n66\n00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.714\nPowershell attack vectors\nthat's a big area today.\n\n67\n00:04:28.714 --> 00:04:33.140\nYou've got a Powershell being used,\nPowershell commands being used.\n\n68\n00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.540\nThird party modules are kinda\nbuilt to work with this.\n\n69\n00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.630\nWe're going for\nthe website attack vector so\n\n70\n00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.771\nI throw that up there and\nI'm after a credential harvester attack.\n\n71\n00:04:45.771 --> 00:04:51.430\nI wanna harvest this\nperson's Facebook login.\n\n72\n00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.100\nSo I pick module three, and\nI need to clone a Web site.\n\n73\n00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.123\nAnd so 2, I hit there.\n\n74\n00:04:58.123 --> 00:05:00.575\nSo the first thing it's gonna ask me,\nreally,\n\n75\n00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:02.790\nis what's the IP address of this machine?\n\n76\n00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.571\nI did pull it up and\nthat's why we have a start over.\n\n77\n00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:12.833\nI need this 43.163, so let's see,\n\n78\n00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:18.880\nI should be able to\njust paste it in there.\n\n79\n00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.369\nNo, that's not happening.\n\n80\n00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:25.844\nAll right, so 192.168.43.1,\n\n81\n00:05:25.844 --> 00:05:28.729\nwhat is that, 163?\n\n82\n00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.260\nYep, check it, 163 43 163.\n\n83\n00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.550\nOkay, so\nthat basically creates this Web server\n\n84\n00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.170\nthat we need to link back to, okay great.\n\n85\n00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:51.525\nThe URL to clone: http://www.facebook\n\n86\n00:05:51.525 --> 00:05:56.740\n.com.\n\n87\n00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.070\nThis could take a little bit,\nbut don't they all?\n\n88\n00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.437\nWe're getting really,\nreally effective at doing this.\n\n89\n00:06:08.042 --> 00:06:10.260\nGreat, so, Apache's not running.\n\n90\n00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.255\nSo, I will say yes, start Apache.\n\n91\n00:06:13.255 --> 00:06:15.430\nStarting the Web server,\neverything has been set.\n\n92\n00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.960\nAnd you'll see that it's telling me that\nthe information's gonna wind back in\n\n93\n00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.750\nthe In the var dub dub dub folder.\n\n94\n00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.650\nSo that's where we're gonna look for\nshould we be successful with this.\n\n95\n00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.749\nSo my next phase of this\n\n96\n00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:40.332\nis to log in to Google.\n\n97\n00:06:40.332 --> 00:06:41.030\nGmail.\n\n98\n00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.434\nI'm going to use Gmail\nas my attacking tool.\n\n99\n00:06:48.631 --> 00:06:50.910\nMan, everybody wants to be slow today.\n\n100\n00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.500\nEverybody is taking their time.\n\n101\n00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.947\n>> What hurry are in you Tom?\n\n102\n00:06:55.947 --> 00:06:57.191\nCome on.\n\n103\n00:06:57.191 --> 00:06:58.410\n[LAUGH]\n>> We've got a half hour to do this.\n\n104\n00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.645\nIt.\n\n105\n00:06:59.645 --> 00:07:00.312\n>> [LAUGH] I know.\n\n106\n00:07:00.312 --> 00:07:02.823\n[CROSSTALK] Ticking in our face.\n\n107\n00:07:02.823 --> 00:07:07.623\n>> All right so just so happens that\nI'm logged in under Green Leaf tech.\n\n108\n00:07:07.623 --> 00:07:08.215\nOkay?\n\n109\n00:07:08.215 --> 00:07:10.760\nThis is my fictitious consulting company.\n\n110\n00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.636\nAnd I would like to create a new email,\nyeah.\n\n111\n00:07:24.282 --> 00:07:27.372\nSo Green Leaf tech actually\ngets a number of things, but\n\n112\n00:07:27.372 --> 00:07:29.297\nwe're gonna compose a new email.\n\n113\n00:07:29.297 --> 00:07:30.506\nGood.\n\n114\n00:07:30.506 --> 00:07:35.248\nIn that email, okay, I'm gonna send\n\n115\n00:07:35.248 --> 00:07:39.552\nit to jimmy007@gmail.com.\n\n116\n00:07:39.552 --> 00:07:40.294\n>> He's a good guy.\n\n117\n00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:41.144\n>> He's a good guy.\n\n118\n00:07:41.144 --> 00:07:42.605\nI like Jimmy.\n\n119\n00:07:42.605 --> 00:07:43.465\nI like Jimmy a lot.\n\n120\n00:07:43.465 --> 00:07:45.005\n>> He's a good fellow.\n\n121\n00:07:53.996 --> 00:07:58.359\nOkay, so now,\nwhat I need to do is create a hyperlink.\n\n122\n00:07:58.359 --> 00:07:59.442\nAnd so.\n\n123\n00:07:59.442 --> 00:08:04.180\nA hyperlink's gonna be the return address,\nokay?\n\n124\n00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:09.178\nI could put in here,\n\n125\n00:08:09.178 --> 00:08:15.058\nhey, Jimmy, check out\n\n126\n00:08:15.058 --> 00:08:20.091\nmy new motorcycle.\n\n127\n00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:25.280\nBut, hang it up a little bit.\n\n128\n00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.550\nHere we go.\n\n129\n00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.330\nOkay, but the web address is gonna be\n\n130\n00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.268\nThat.\n\n131\n00:08:52.268 --> 00:08:55.980\nAnd so, hence, I make it up.\n\n132\n00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.080\nThat's actually what the email looks like.\n\n133\n00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.910\nSo, I send it to Jimmy.\n\n134\n00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:07.710\nAnd So\nwe dropped his virtual machine here.\n\n135\n00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.240\nWe go over to Jimmy's machine,\nsitting here,\n\n136\n00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:21.890\nJimmy's already logged in and\nJimmy opens up his Google, okay?\n\n137\n00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.870\nSo Jimmy goes, hey, let me check my email.\n\n138\n00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.760\nJimmy just got a new,\nhe just got this email.\n\n139\n00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.450\nSays hey, check it out so\nJimmy wants to click on it, okay?\n\n140\n00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:35.299\nAnd he sees the link.\n\n141\n00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.220\nHe clicks on the link.\n\n142\n00:09:47.561 --> 00:09:48.589\nBut we are not redirecting.\n\n143\n00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:59.290\nI put the wrong address in so,\nI've got to type it in automatically.\n\n144\n00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.880\nI put the wrong, so it's important,\n\n145\n00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.005\nwhen you do this,\nto put in the correct address.\n\n146\n00:10:08.005 --> 00:10:12.270\n>> [LAUGH] We'll make these\nthings run a little better, okay?\n\n147\n00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.190\n>> And there is the Facebook page.\n\n148\n00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:19.700\nSo Jimmy goes, I don't care about that.\n\n149\n00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.770\nI get this things all the time.\n\n150\n00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:21.870\nYou know what I mean?\n\n151\n00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.130\nYeah, we'll keep running the script.\n\n152\n00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:28.580\nOkay so, we'll go.\n\n153\n00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.126\nThis is my log in, Big Jimmy.\n\n154\n00:10:33.814 --> 00:10:38.825\nMy password is 12345678.\n\n155\n00:10:38.825 --> 00:10:41.133\nAnd he logs in.\n\n156\n00:10:41.133 --> 00:10:42.171\nNow I never do this,\n\n157\n00:10:42.171 --> 00:10:47.075\ncuz that's a bad [CROSSTALK] you'll get\na bad habit doing that type of stuff okay.\n\n158\n00:10:47.075 --> 00:10:50.375\nWell-\n>> What happened-\n\n159\n00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:52.175\n>> Must a glitched.\n\n160\n00:10:52.175 --> 00:10:55.775\nTry to log in-\n>> So anyway, Jimmy will log in again but\n\n161\n00:10:55.775 --> 00:10:59.252\nif you notice on top, that had actually\ntook me to Facebook this time.\n\n162\n00:10:59.252 --> 00:11:02.362\n>> Yeah.\n>> So that, how many glitches do you have?\n\n163\n00:11:02.362 --> 00:11:08.942\nSo we kinda roll back to our\nsocial engineering toolkit.\n\n164\n00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:16.440\nOkay, drop this guy, I can actually\ndrop this page at this point.\n\n165\n00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.240\nAnd really just now go to\nthat folder that we initially\n\n166\n00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:26.120\ntalked about in the file systems\nwhich is on the bar folder, okay.\n\n167\n00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.060\nAnd you'll see that you have\nyour www stuff in here.\n\n168\n00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.940\nAnd I have a little file that's\nsitting in there, and if I click and\n\n169\n00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:41.210\nopen that file up We'll\nsee that roll down.\n\n170\n00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.870\nThere you go.\nWe just grabbed Jimmy's login and\n\n171\n00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.690\npassword and\nnow I just hijacked Jimmy's Facebook page.\n\n172\n00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:49.930\n>> You're a dangerous man.\n\n173\n00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.800\n>> That is pretty cool.\n\n174\n00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.740\n>> That is really cool.\n\n175\n00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.050\n>> It amazes me all the time.\n\n176\n00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.505\nBut boys and girls don't try this at home.\n\n177\n00:11:57.505 --> 00:12:01.480\n>> [LAUGH] You should not be stealing\nFacebook pages or logins right.\n\n178\n00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:09.200\n>> So I hope you enjoyed\nthat little bit as well.\n\n179\n00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.962\nWe can kinda drop this out, but that\ndoesn't really conclude the tools at all,\n\n180\n00:12:12.962 --> 00:12:14.658\nthat's just like using two tools.\n\n181\n00:12:14.658 --> 00:12:15.790\n>> Yeah.\n\n182\n00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.450\n>> Out of the whole [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Very dangerous tools apparently.\n\n183\n00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:24.410\n>> So,\nlet me pop up some of my stuff here,\n\n184\n00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:31.770\nget into mode, I gotta run through all\nthis, and by the way, I'm going to leave\n\n185\n00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:38.680\nall these slides came with\nthe good people here at ITProTV.\n\n186\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.410\nSo that they can give them to you.\n\n187\n00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:47.930\nAll right, so locks.\n\n188\n00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:52.950\nLock picking really isn't a social\nengineering technique per se,\n\n189\n00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.460\nbecause you're not really\ndealing with people, okay.\n\n190\n00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:59.150\nHowever, you may get into a social\nengineering exploit where you\n\n191\n00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.180\nmust talk your way through the guard.\n\n192\n00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.010\nYou've got through two or\nthree doors by tailgating.\n\n193\n00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:10.946\nThen, you may have gotten into\nan office that you need to get into and\n\n194\n00:13:10.946 --> 00:13:14.820\nyou don't really, it's locked, okay.\n\n195\n00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.990\nOr you may opt to get out.\n\n196\n00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.820\nSo sometimes there are access\ncontrols going in and\n\n197\n00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.500\nthere are access controls going out.\n\n198\n00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.020\nAnd I know people have actually\ngotten into these situations.\n\n199\n00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:29.830\nLock picking is a skill.\n\n200\n00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:34.050\nYou can develop it, there are tools\nout there that you see here.\n\n201\n00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:39.920\nTypically, the standard lock\ncertainly has all the tumblers that\n\n202\n00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:45.640\nare set at different levels, and\nyou use a tool really a tension bar and\n\n203\n00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:51.290\na lock pick to slide all those\ntumblers up to a level point.\n\n204\n00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.110\nIt takes a little bit of work to.\n\n205\n00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:57.590\nSo it's best if you're going to practice\nto practice with an old worn lock first.\n\n206\n00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:01.130\nIt is a little easier to work\nwith then work your way up, okay.\n\n207\n00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:05.150\nI myself have found one of the best\nlock picking tools ever okay.\n\n208\n00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.560\nTaught to me by one of the k and a gang\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n209\n00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.050\n>> was a credit card.\n\n210\n00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.350\nOkay?\nSo it's now it's not gonna get you past\n\n211\n00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:18.610\nthe dead bolt but I can get through\nany latch, knob lock it completely.\n\n212\n00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:19.900\nNever fails okay?\n\n213\n00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:20.450\nSo.\n\n214\n00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.390\n>> When I was a kid I used\nto I found lock picking.\n\n215\n00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.220\nI wanted to get into things that were\nlocked because there's gotta be something\n\n216\n00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:31.650\ncool in there, and I learned to\npick door locks using paper clips\n\n217\n00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:33.487\nwhen I was about 13.\n\n218\n00:14:33.487 --> 00:14:35.550\n[LAUGH]\n>> Handcuffs.\n\n219\n00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.450\n>> Yeah.\n>> Handcuffs.\n\n220\n00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:43.300\nSo next is really, these little\nshims that slide into the lock.\n\n221\n00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.730\nIt could be done with a padlock, but\n\n222\n00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.180\nreally shims are used with handcuffs and\nit's a skill.\n\n223\n00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.380\nIt's something you should know.\n\n224\n00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:58.572\nYou may wind up in a situation where\nyou are handcuffed out in Thailand and\n\n225\n00:14:58.572 --> 00:15:06.150\nyou will find knowing\nthe skill to be helpful.\n\n226\n00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.340\nSo, basically, in a padlock,\nthat's with a shim, but the same way,\n\n227\n00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.950\nwith the handcuffs,\nthe shim kinda slips down there and\n\n228\n00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:15.890\nit helps to relieve the tension\nbar on the clasp itself.\n\n229\n00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:21.081\n>> Yeah, I've seen YouTube videos of\npeople creating shims out of Coke cans.\n\n230\n00:15:21.081 --> 00:15:25.472\nThey cut them out of Coke cans fold them,\nmold them, slide them down in there and\n\n231\n00:15:25.472 --> 00:15:26.993\npop the combination lock.\n\n232\n00:15:26.993 --> 00:15:33.830\n>> Sure,\nour hero in this endeavor is MacGyver.\n\n233\n00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.400\nWe all love MacGyver and\n\n234\n00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.718\nwe all want to be MacGyver and you got\nto put yourself into MacGyver's head.\n\n235\n00:15:40.718 --> 00:15:47.660\nJust let MacGyver take over your mind and\nbody when you do these things.\n\n236\n00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:54.441\nCameras, believe or not there's a camera\nin a tie but there are all kinds.\n\n237\n00:15:54.441 --> 00:16:00.051\nI do a lot of camera work,\nmy favorite are these 360 degree\n\n238\n00:16:00.051 --> 00:16:05.559\ncameras that are bubble lenses\nthat sit in one area but yet.\n\n239\n00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:09.560\nAre very expansive, you could see\neverything going on at the same time.\n\n240\n00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.870\nBut yeah, sometimes people want,\nthey want pinhole cameras.\n\n241\n00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:17.360\nThey want a camera in the clock,\nin the smoke detector.\n\n242\n00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:22.236\nSo, as well, for\nour one video where they used a camera\n\n243\n00:16:22.236 --> 00:16:27.113\nto be able to find out where\nthe security cameras were,\n\n244\n00:16:27.113 --> 00:16:33.812\nwhat the door access codes were, and\nas well, they're recording voice.\n\n245\n00:16:33.812 --> 00:16:38.244\nSo they really picked up the names\nof managers as they elicited\n\n246\n00:16:38.244 --> 00:16:40.897\ninformation that that ploy worked.\n\n247\n00:16:40.897 --> 00:16:45.973\nAnd by the way,\nthat's a true ploy, true ploy.\n\n248\n00:16:45.973 --> 00:16:50.171\nGood, so\nthat's just one aspect of our tools.\n\n249\n00:16:50.171 --> 00:16:56.940\nI mean, we have VoIP spoofing.\n\n250\n00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:01.760\nSo with VoIP,\nit's very possible through understanding\n\n251\n00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.320\nthe way SIP addressing works to\njust mask who you're calling from.\n\n252\n00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.210\nAnd today you never know.\n\n253\n00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:15.098\nYou'll get calls today from, say,\nChina or India or Philippines or\n\n254\n00:17:15.098 --> 00:17:20.081\nMexico, out of the country being my point-\n>> Apparently Kingston, Jamaica.\n\n255\n00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:23.016\n>> That will look like it's actually\nin your, yeah, Kingston, Jamaica.\n\n256\n00:17:23.016 --> 00:17:25.980\nBut it'll look like it's\nin your local area, okay.\n\n257\n00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:30.386\nSo maybe what throws you\noff is the dialect, okay.\n\n258\n00:17:30.386 --> 00:17:35.438\nBut I myself have the numbers for\nSpain and other countries,\n\n259\n00:17:35.438 --> 00:17:42.088\nbecause there are people there I know\nthat I talk to, so it makes easier, yeah.\n\n260\n00:17:42.088 --> 00:17:43.520\n>> Well,\nit's just like using Skype, right?\n\n261\n00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.976\nSkype will allow you to get a local\nphone number from a region that you\n\n262\n00:17:46.976 --> 00:17:49.523\nneed a local number, so\nthat when people call it,\n\n263\n00:17:49.523 --> 00:17:53.740\nit's not a long-distance call for them,\nand you just pay for the service.\n\n264\n00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.040\nAnd now you have a local number.\n\n265\n00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.800\nI can use that to call somewhere that\nI'm not actually and spend a few bucks.\n\n266\n00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.345\nObviously, if I'm going to pilfer them and\nmake money off of it,\n\n267\n00:18:02.345 --> 00:18:04.122\nit's gonna be a worth the investment for\nme.\n\n268\n00:18:04.122 --> 00:18:06.830\nBut that's the kind of things\nwe've got to be looking out for,\n\n269\n00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.839\nbecause that is an extremely\neasy thing to do.\n\n270\n00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:13.460\nAnybody can do that, and it doesn't\ntake a lot of technical expertise.\n\n271\n00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.815\n>> Burner apps.\n\n272\n00:18:14.815 --> 00:18:15.810\nWe've got a burner app.\n\n273\n00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:22.942\nI just buy a number, use it, I could\nsend SMS messages, I can talk to people.\n\n274\n00:18:22.942 --> 00:18:25.976\nAnd a lot of times I screw\nwith them just to do it.\n\n275\n00:18:25.976 --> 00:18:29.800\nYou can have apps on your phone\nthat'll change your voice.\n\n276\n00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.879\n[SOUND]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n277\n00:18:31.879 --> 00:18:33.837\n>> Really low or really high pitched or\n\n278\n00:18:33.837 --> 00:18:36.457\njust, kind of wacky sounds or,\nmake it laugh.\n\n279\n00:18:36.457 --> 00:18:40.996\nI mean, there are some fun ones,\nbut at the same time,\n\n280\n00:18:40.996 --> 00:18:45.733\na way of disguising your voice and\njust play it as a prank,\n\n281\n00:18:45.733 --> 00:18:47.027\nbut-\n>> Call your friends and\n\n282\n00:18:47.027 --> 00:18:48.350\ntell them you kidnapped their dog.\n\n283\n00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.468\nAt this point, really,\neven the phone itself.\n\n284\n00:18:50.468 --> 00:18:53.714\nI mean, in most cases, like I told you,\n\n285\n00:18:53.714 --> 00:18:58.392\nI went to a preview of a film\nthat was just a prerelease, and\n\n286\n00:18:58.392 --> 00:19:02.978\nthey wanted everybody's phones,\nbecause naturally,\n\n287\n00:19:02.978 --> 00:19:07.296\nthe people are gonna sit there and\ntape the screener.\n\n288\n00:19:07.296 --> 00:19:13.247\nAnd that really is theft of-\n>> Intellectual property?\n\n289\n00:19:13.247 --> 00:19:14.768\n>> Yeah, intellectual property.\n\n290\n00:19:14.768 --> 00:19:21.097\nSo, rightly so,\nthey really should do that.\n\n291\n00:19:21.097 --> 00:19:23.857\nMoving down the line, GPS trackers.\n\n292\n00:19:23.857 --> 00:19:27.515\nAnd you have to learn to tail somebody.\n\n293\n00:19:27.515 --> 00:19:28.950\nOne of the best and\n\n294\n00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:34.794\neasiest ways to put a GPS tracker today\nis through the OBD port in the car.\n\n295\n00:19:34.794 --> 00:19:35.516\nCars have them.\n\n296\n00:19:35.516 --> 00:19:36.601\nYou slide it in there.\n\n297\n00:19:36.601 --> 00:19:41.490\nIt'll pick up the location.\n\n298\n00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:42.830\nAnd you go back and just pull it out.\n\n299\n00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.610\nI mean, most people don't, when they get\nin their car, look and see, hey, man,\n\n300\n00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:50.310\nis that OBD device plugged into my car?\n\n301\n00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:57.780\nSo I've spent a little time actually\nexploring the whole car hacking area, so\n\n302\n00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:04.650\nI've got a little Fiat 500 that I've\nbeen running a OBD device in, right?\n\n303\n00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:10.650\nSo running for about a month, and\nall of a sudden my car starts going crazy.\n\n304\n00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:16.077\nI mean, the dashboard was saying,\ntransmission needs to be checked,\n\n305\n00:20:16.077 --> 00:20:21.603\nengine overheating, I'm getting\nall the lights, I'm freaking out.\n\n306\n00:20:21.603 --> 00:20:23.759\nAnd then it wouldn't\nshift out of second gear.\n\n307\n00:20:23.759 --> 00:20:28.079\nIt would stay in second gear,\nwouldn't down shift, wouldn't up shift.\n\n308\n00:20:28.079 --> 00:20:30.848\nAnd when I take it out of gear,\nit would go out of gear,\n\n309\n00:20:30.848 --> 00:20:33.080\nbut it would bang when\nI put it back in gear.\n\n310\n00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.479\nSo I called a tow truck,\nhad it towed to the dealer, right?\n\n311\n00:20:37.479 --> 00:20:41.329\nGuy goes, yeah, you got a OBD\nscanner in here that's knocking,\n\n312\n00:20:41.329 --> 00:20:43.437\nit's just making the car go crazy.\n\n313\n00:20:43.437 --> 00:20:46.944\nI pulled it out and\nreset everything, and it's fine.\n\n314\n00:20:46.944 --> 00:20:51.793\nSo if you do decide to\nuse it as a GPS tracker,\n\n315\n00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:55.365\nyou could cause some problems.\n\n316\n00:20:55.365 --> 00:20:58.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I found later that for some people,\n\n317\n00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:01.510\nthat's what happens, so, because\nthey're communicating back and forth.\n\n318\n00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:06.770\nThat's a whole other area\nof social engineering,\n\n319\n00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:10.619\njust keeping tabs on where\npeople are going and coming.\n\n320\n00:21:10.619 --> 00:21:14.650\nAudio recording, right?\n\n321\n00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.170\nYour phone's a great little device,\nthey're very easy to record,\n\n322\n00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:19.560\nyour computer.\n\n323\n00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:25.670\nAnd as well, these things are used back\nat you, because if I sent you that email,\n\n324\n00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:31.680\nI was able to drop that listener into your\nmachine, I can now turn on the camera.\n\n325\n00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.180\nI can now turn on the microphone.\n\n326\n00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.620\nAnd I can now listen to your conversation\nand I know what's going on in the room.\n\n327\n00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.420\nEven crazier yet,\nI can do it to your phone.\n\n328\n00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.720\nHow do you like that?\n\n329\n00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.660\n>> I don't like it at all.\n\n330\n00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.450\nYou're scaring me, sir.\n\n331\n00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:49.410\n>> Most people will put a piece\nof tape over the camera.\n\n332\n00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:53.462\n>> Yeah, they even have the little ones\nyou can buy that are prefabricated plastic\n\n333\n00:21:53.462 --> 00:21:55.532\npieces that will slide open and closed.\n\n334\n00:21:55.532 --> 00:21:57.035\n>> The phone's the craziest,\n\n335\n00:21:57.035 --> 00:22:01.115\nbecause there are known cases of espionage\nthat have been done using a phone.\n\n336\n00:22:01.115 --> 00:22:03.464\nAnd everybody's carrying them.\n\n337\n00:22:03.464 --> 00:22:08.830\nOkay, so, and of course,\nmy favorite, Dick Tracy.\n\n338\n00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:12.102\nOkay, I don't know,\nI'm probably really dating myself, but\n\n339\n00:22:12.102 --> 00:22:14.070\nDick Tracy was a cartoon.\n\n340\n00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:19.320\nDick Tracy had a wristwatch\nthat he can talk to people on.\n\n341\n00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.892\nIt was like, that's crazy,\nno, you can't do that stuff.\n\n342\n00:22:21.892 --> 00:22:27.254\nBut it's amazing how the writer\nof that was just so far ahead.\n\n343\n00:22:27.254 --> 00:22:34.162\nProbably inspired even Steve Jobs to get\non the thing and create an Apple Watch.\n\n344\n00:22:34.162 --> 00:22:38.116\n>> Every kid back in the day wanted\nto have that radio wristwatch so\n\n345\n00:22:38.116 --> 00:22:40.139\nthey could talk back and forth.\n\n346\n00:22:40.139 --> 00:22:42.556\nAnd now it's like life imitating art.\n\n347\n00:22:42.556 --> 00:22:44.679\n>> Right, right.\n\n348\n00:22:44.679 --> 00:22:47.943\nAnd that's pretty much a rundown\nof the tools that we have.\n\n349\n00:22:47.943 --> 00:22:50.440\n>> All right, well,\nit was a really good rundown.\n\n350\n00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.640\nThere's obviously a lot of extremely\n\n351\n00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.080\ndangerous if in the wrong\nhands tools out there.\n\n352\n00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.020\nThe Cobalt Strike, extremely impressive,\nusing the SE Toolkit,\n\n353\n00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.468\nextremely impressive.\n\n354\n00:23:01.468 --> 00:23:03.540\nObviously, lock picking and\n\n355\n00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:07.100\nthings are skills and techniques\nthat we can pick up, anybody can do.\n\n356\n00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.740\nBut it wasn't very difficult.\n\n357\n00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.440\n>> Do the same thing, actually,\n\n358\n00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.592\nI've done this where we send\nthe Facebook login to the phone.\n\n359\n00:23:13.592 --> 00:23:17.680\n[LAUGH] You login from the phone, boom!\n\n360\n00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.340\nSame thing.\n\n361\n00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.510\n>> We live in a very dangerous society,\nyou've gotta be careful.\n\n362\n00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.606\n>> In fact, there's another\none going around, actually,\n\n363\n00:23:21.606 --> 00:23:22.555\nmy wife got hit with this.\n\n364\n00:23:22.555 --> 00:23:27.158\nShe gets an email from a friend,\nsomebody from her gym, and\n\n365\n00:23:27.158 --> 00:23:29.839\nit says, you have a secure email.\n\n366\n00:23:31.435 --> 00:23:35.510\nNow, why would she send me,\nshe opens it up and then there it was.\n\n367\n00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:41.646\nIt asked her for her Google login,\nwhich was the exact ploy, the exact thing.\n\n368\n00:23:41.646 --> 00:23:44.524\nNo, no, no,\nyou don't wanna put that in there.\n\n369\n00:23:44.524 --> 00:23:47.855\nBut that one's going around, so\nwatch it, be careful with that one.\n\n370\n00:23:47.855 --> 00:23:51.771\nThat's a current thing,\nbecause it's secure,\n\n371\n00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:55.511\nit's a secure email,\nI mean, it must be good.\n\n372\n00:23:55.511 --> 00:23:57.916\n>> Well, and plus, here's my mindset is,\n\n373\n00:23:57.916 --> 00:24:01.850\nI typically stay logged in through\nmy mobile devices and my laptop.\n\n374\n00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:05.090\nI say, remember me and stay logged in.\n\n375\n00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.760\nSo if I get an email says, follow this\nlink, and it shows me a login page,\n\n376\n00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.030\nI'm like,\nI'll just go straight to Google myself.\n\n377\n00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:12.747\n>> Right.\n>> I don't trust those.\n\n378\n00:24:12.747 --> 00:24:17.016\nI always turn on the, that shows you what\nURL when you hover over a link, so if it\n\n379\n00:24:17.016 --> 00:24:21.745\nlooks suspicious, you need to check those\nthings out, cuz that's exactly how social\n\n380\n00:24:21.745 --> 00:24:26.118\nengineering gets into, gets passwords\njust like what we've shown you today.\n\n381\n00:24:26.118 --> 00:24:29.429\nIf we were just to look at the link and\nsee where it was gonna take us,\n\n382\n00:24:29.429 --> 00:24:31.988\nwe would have seen that wasn't Facebook,\nright?\n\n383\n00:24:31.988 --> 00:24:34.008\nThat was one of Tom's servers.\n\n384\n00:24:34.008 --> 00:24:36.001\nIt was just a faked Facebook page.\n\n385\n00:24:36.001 --> 00:24:40.781\nAnd then I would have said, I'll just\nlogin to Facebook from www.facebook.com,\n\n386\n00:24:40.781 --> 00:24:43.088\nand I know I'm more\nsafe doing it that way.\n\n387\n00:24:43.088 --> 00:24:44.461\nSo that's what we've gotta look out for.\n\n388\n00:24:44.461 --> 00:24:45.521\nTom, you've done a great job.\n\n389\n00:24:45.521 --> 00:24:49.547\nAnd you're scaring the mess out of just\nabout everybody that's watching this\n\n390\n00:24:49.547 --> 00:24:50.647\nepisode, I am sure.\n\n391\n00:24:50.647 --> 00:24:52.234\nBut we do appreciate you [CROSSTALK]\n>> And\n\n392\n00:24:52.234 --> 00:24:54.778\nI'll email you any information you want,\nyeah.\n\n393\n00:24:54.778 --> 00:24:55.580\n>> Awesome.\n\n394\n00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:56.920\nWell, thanks for dropping by today.\n\n395\n00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.130\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n396\n00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:59.760\n>> Great.\n>> But it is time to sign off.\n\n397\n00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.950\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.250\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.510\nin today's episode we continue\nforth with more social engineering.\n\n5\n00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.670\nJoining us back in our studio again\ntoday to help us out with that is\n\n6\n00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.460\nour good friend Mr. Tom Updegrove.\n\n7\n00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.915\nTom, we're so glad to have you back sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.915 --> 00:00:29.870\nHow's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:30.770\n>> It's going great Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.350\nSo we've walked through\nour planning phases.\n\n11\n00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.180\nWe've looked at some of the psychological\ncomponents, really, elicitation,\n\n12\n00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.950\ninfluence.\n\n13\n00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.790\nWe looked at some of\nthe tools of the trade.\n\n14\n00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:53.104\nHow people are actually getting into\nour machines, getting across on us, in.\n\n15\n00:00:53.104 --> 00:00:55.636\nNow that we've got all those components,\n\n16\n00:00:55.636 --> 00:00:58.848\nwe wanna talk a thing\nabout the attack cycle.\n\n17\n00:00:58.848 --> 00:01:02.496\nThis really kinda goes back to planning,\nbut\n\n18\n00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:06.248\nat the same time,\nwe now have more artillery.\n\n19\n00:01:06.248 --> 00:01:08.790\nWe kind of know what the tools are.\n\n20\n00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.714\nSo and the best way I can do\nthat really is to explain\n\n21\n00:01:13.714 --> 00:01:17.943\nmaybe the way a fighter\ngoes into the ring.\n\n22\n00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:20.965\nWhen a fighter goes into the ring,\n\n23\n00:01:20.965 --> 00:01:26.184\nhe's already done preliminary\nresearch on his opponent.\n\n24\n00:01:26.184 --> 00:01:27.690\nHe's watched some fight tapes.\n\n25\n00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.660\nTo me, this thing goes really pretty\nmuch for any kind of sporting event.\n\n26\n00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.797\nBut in a fight game,\nthey watch everything.\n\n27\n00:01:33.797 --> 00:01:36.640\nThey're looking at the defense,\nthe offense,\n\n28\n00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.730\nthe kind of training the person does.\n\n29\n00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.670\nAll the different attitudes,\n\n30\n00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.920\nmoves, personality.\n\n31\n00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.142\nAll the elements that that\nfighter might have, so.\n\n32\n00:01:52.142 --> 00:01:54.265\nBut even when they get in the ring,\nthey're still gonna survey.\n\n33\n00:01:54.265 --> 00:01:59.330\nAnd usually in a fight,\nfirst round is just kind of a feeler out.\n\n34\n00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.020\nAssessing what the capabilities,\ndo they come out strong?\n\n35\n00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.610\nAre they holding back?\n\n36\n00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.843\nAre they defensive player?\n\n37\n00:02:06.843 --> 00:02:08.430\nAre they offensive player?\n\n38\n00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:14.820\nAnd from that assessment that they pull\nout, they then develop a battle plan.\n\n39\n00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.850\nSo the battle plan then says well, maybe,\n\n40\n00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.250\nI think that person really is prime for\na pump fake.\n\n41\n00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.510\nThey'll throw probes to\nsee how the person reacts,\n\n42\n00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.255\nthat person will react by either opening\nand exposing areas or staying tight.\n\n43\n00:02:33.255 --> 00:02:36.265\nMaybe they don't even flinch about it.\n\n44\n00:02:36.265 --> 00:02:41.205\nBut usually the first thing I do\nis I try to find what the person's\n\n45\n00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:44.418\nspeed is like and also the reaction time.\n\n46\n00:02:44.418 --> 00:02:45.775\nI'm looking at those two elements.\n\n47\n00:02:45.775 --> 00:02:48.179\nI'm looking to see how fast\nthey are on their feet.\n\n48\n00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:50.753\nSo, do they have mobility?\n\n49\n00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:52.845\nDo they have perceptual ability?\n\n50\n00:02:53.865 --> 00:02:58.596\nEven in a sense, are they picking up and\ncueing up on sounds?\n\n51\n00:02:58.596 --> 00:03:00.098\nSometimes you've got to\nbe a little quieter.\n\n52\n00:03:00.098 --> 00:03:03.810\nI mean people pick up, remember,\nwe had those five elements.\n\n53\n00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.850\nSo we've got sight,\nwe've got the audible level,\n\n54\n00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.210\nthe hearing level, we've got the feel.\n\n55\n00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.149\nWe've got the combination\nof those elements.\n\n56\n00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.767\nSo if we could throw up\na little diagram here.\n\n57\n00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:25.630\nThis is what I call the game plan, right.\n\n58\n00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.236\nYou survey, from your survey\nlooking at the strength and\n\n59\n00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:34.490\nweaknesses of your opponent or\nyour subject, you're gonna assess.\n\n60\n00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.826\nGonna assess the capabilities and\nso on of that person and then plan.\n\n61\n00:03:40.826 --> 00:03:43.490\nFor your plan, you then commit.\n\n62\n00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.780\nGenerally, the survey,\n\n63\n00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.360\nthe assessment, and the planning\nare done outside of critical range.\n\n64\n00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.180\nThe critical range would be, well, for\n\n65\n00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.140\na boxer just how close you\ncan be before you're hit.\n\n66\n00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.666\nYou're outside of that range, okay,\nas long as time and space stays the same,\n\n67\n00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:01.166\nyou're not gonna be hit.\n\n68\n00:04:01.166 --> 00:04:06.205\nOnce you step into what we call\nthe pocket, then you've got a commit.\n\n69\n00:04:06.205 --> 00:04:09.945\nThe commitment, it just boom, you just\ngo with your instinct at that point.\n\n70\n00:04:09.945 --> 00:04:12.239\nYou step back out of the pocket,\nhow'd that work?\n\n71\n00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.845\nOkay, are they laying on the ground,\nor am I bleeding?\n\n72\n00:04:15.845 --> 00:04:21.173\nSo you reassess at that point,\nokay, and reformulate, regroup,\n\n73\n00:04:21.173 --> 00:04:27.167\ngo back, plan, commit, and the cycle\ngoes on until the end of the contest.\n\n74\n00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:29.437\n>> So it's always a very fluid dynamic.\n\n75\n00:04:29.437 --> 00:04:31.260\n>> It's a fluid dynamic, exactly.\n\n76\n00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.090\nThat's what I'd like you\nto see from that diagram.\n\n77\n00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:40.680\nNow, we put together a little vignette\nto kind of explain the game plan.\n\n78\n00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.017\nSo if we can get that one\nrolling at this point,\n\n79\n00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:47.536\nI think you'll find it's\nreally interesting.\n\n80\n00:04:47.536 --> 00:04:51.216\n[SOUND]\n>> We must get a bird's-eye view of\n\n81\n00:04:51.216 --> 00:04:52.552\nthe enemy's strength.\n\n82\n00:04:52.552 --> 00:04:56.638\n>> Yes, sir, and\nI think I know how we can do that.\n\n83\n00:04:56.638 --> 00:04:59.646\n[SOUND]\n\n84\n00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:13.209\n>> Okay, now we know where they are and\n\n85\n00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:14.281\nwhat they are.\n\n86\n00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:17.250\n>> So do we make a frontal attack and\ngo at them directly?\n\n87\n00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.729\n>> No, it would be wiser to make an\nindirect attack by drawing them out into\n\n88\n00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.560\nthe open field, and then attack their\nflank when they least expect it.\n\n89\n00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.440\n>> An attack by draw you say.\n\n90\n00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.729\nNow what are the drawbacks from this plan?\n\n91\n00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.250\n>> Well, we need some way to entice\nthem to come out into the open.\n\n92\n00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.560\n>> How about we send a small defenseless\nsquad out into the field, and\n\n93\n00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.350\nhope that they go after them?\n\n94\n00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.450\n>> Excellent idea.\n\n95\n00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.600\nNow, what other information\ndid we get from our spies?\n\n96\n00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.110\n>> Sir, while spying on the enemy,\nI note that their food supply is low,\n\n97\n00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.440\nand that the troop morale is low, and\nthere's much bickering amongst themselves.\n\n98\n00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.153\n>> Good.\nI see.\n\n99\n00:05:57.153 --> 00:05:59.910\nI think that I think we are ready\nto put this plan into action.\n\n100\n00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.460\nLet's attack now.\n\n101\n00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.960\n>> I think Peter went a little\nanachronistic with the jetpack,\n\n102\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.285\nbut that did make a good point there.\n\n103\n00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:12.930\n>> Well, the cool thing about the jetpack,\nand we were thinking maybe a balloon or\n\n104\n00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.820\nsomething floating over, but\nreally it's kind of like\n\n105\n00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.282\na person using some type of little\n\n106\n00:06:22.282 --> 00:06:27.940\nhovercraft skycam floating\nover all of the drones.\n\n107\n00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:34.505\nI mean a lot of people use drones really\nto scope out the structural building,\n\n108\n00:06:34.505 --> 00:06:39.252\naccess in the roof,\nreally get an idea of maybe that they\n\n109\n00:06:39.252 --> 00:06:42.991\nmay be able to make\npenetration from above.\n\n110\n00:06:42.991 --> 00:06:46.950\nSo, nothing like a bird's-eye view, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.140\nIn fact, look at our GPS technology today.\n\n112\n00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:55.340\nThe ability to have the bird's-eye\nview of how the traffic\n\n113\n00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.644\nflow goes is instrumental,\nI mean it's phenomenal in terms\n\n114\n00:07:00.644 --> 00:07:05.850\nof our navigating roads that\nwe couldn't do ten years ago.\n\n115\n00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.360\nAll right, so I've got another little\ndiagram here that I'm gonna throw up.\n\n116\n00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.770\nAll right, so this is a little more\nrelative to what our tasks at hand are.\n\n117\n00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.459\nWe know that there's\ninformation harvesting,\n\n118\n00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:26.023\nwe need to understand more\nabout the company and\n\n119\n00:07:26.023 --> 00:07:29.116\nthe subject that we're after.\n\n120\n00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:34.810\nFrom that information that we gather,\nwe can build a better target selection.\n\n121\n00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:40.790\nWe can then pinpoint, nail down,\n\n122\n00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.710\nso to say, exactly where we wanna go,\nand who we wanna go after.\n\n123\n00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.912\nIt could be the receptionist\nat the front end,\n\n124\n00:07:48.912 --> 00:07:52.916\nit could be one of the C-level executives.\n\n125\n00:07:52.916 --> 00:07:59.181\nIt could be the janitor, it could\nbe anybody that's in the structure\n\n126\n00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:04.593\nof that organization That kind\nof meets our requirements.\n\n127\n00:08:04.593 --> 00:08:10.381\nThose requirements really came out\nof our information harvesting so\n\n128\n00:08:10.381 --> 00:08:14.570\nthe next phase that we go\nto is developing trust and\n\n129\n00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.670\nrapport with that selected target.\n\n130\n00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.800\nAnd again, as we're gonna see\nin the kinda closing section,\n\n131\n00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.290\nthat trust report, how we pick\nthat target is pretty important.\n\n132\n00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:33.840\nBecause we're gonna use those principles\nof influence coupled with personality\n\n133\n00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:41.140\ntypes to better apply with principle\ninfluence we're going to do.\n\n134\n00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.340\nAnd actually when we have\nall those things lined and\n\n135\n00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:49.530\nput together, then we exploit the target.\n\n136\n00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:54.160\nThe exploitation doesn't always\ngo the way we like it to.\n\n137\n00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:00.220\nI mean sometimes we're lucky but\na lot of times you've got to try and\n\n138\n00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.420\nyourself in different ways,\ndifferent fashion.\n\n139\n00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:09.360\nAnd that's really the reaction that\nwe're getting from our target.\n\n140\n00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.010\nThat target reacts in a kind of\na distancing way or turned off way,\n\n141\n00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:15.700\nthen we need to really apply it.\n\n142\n00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.210\nMaybe, you need to back off and\nbring somebody else.\n\n143\n00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:25.180\nMaybe or bring somebody to really keep\nthe target involved while you go ahead and\n\n144\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:25.680\ndo your thing.\n\n145\n00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.640\nSo teamwork can really be important\nthere in trying to develop your.\n\n146\n00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.270\nMaybe your personality you don't\nfit really well with that.\n\n147\n00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.200\nSo you really need somebody else.\n\n148\n00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.830\nI've got one of my buddies in pan testing,\nuses his kids.\n\n149\n00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:47.140\nSo, yeah he always has a hard time\nreally kind of schmoozing the guards so\n\n150\n00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.390\nhe brought his kid in.\n\n151\n00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.140\nHis kid like threw a little tantrum.\n\n152\n00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.060\nAnyway, that's where we got the idea of\nthat initial video where that kid was\n\n153\n00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.899\nthrowing that tantrum at McDonald's.\n\n154\n00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:03.731\nSo in this case, he actually got\nthe guard distracted enough for\n\n155\n00:10:03.731 --> 00:10:07.370\nhim to go ahead and\ntailgate him somewhere.\n\n156\n00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:12.790\n>> So this doesn't necessarily have to\nbe a lone gunman kind of operation.\n\n157\n00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.100\nYou can definitely bring in and\ncreate a team.\n\n158\n00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.960\nSo that, and then there might even be the\nbetter way to go in a lot of scenarios.\n\n159\n00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.290\n>> Teamwork, I think,\nis a better way to go.\n\n160\n00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.070\nI mean, like everything else,\nsometimes it's a one-person job and\n\n161\n00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.990\nsometimes it really does require a team.\n\n162\n00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:33.560\nAnd I think really,\nteam building is a whole other subject.\n\n163\n00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.030\nIn terms of how to create\nthat dynamic in the teams so\n\n164\n00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:40.630\nthat everybody's working towards the same\ngoal, kinda like the team here at ITPro.\n\n165\n00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.120\nThese guys are a team.\n\n166\n00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.577\nThey work together, okay?\n\n167\n00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:47.975\nI think that I'd like to take them\nout on a social engineering job.\n\n168\n00:10:47.975 --> 00:10:49.570\n>> [LAUGH] That'd be fun.\n\n169\n00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:50.403\nHave a good time doing it.\n\n170\n00:10:50.403 --> 00:10:51.076\nThat's for sure.\n\n171\n00:10:51.076 --> 00:10:53.430\n>> All right, so I've got another here.\n\n172\n00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.860\nI'm just rolling back to this kinda\nfive element concept again, okay?\n\n173\n00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.440\nSo maybe you get a little idea\nwhy I threw this in here.\n\n174\n00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.250\nThis is how, like I said,\n\n175\n00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:07.440\nthe acupuncturist determines balance and\nhealth in an individual.\n\n176\n00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:13.140\nAnd concept also has been\napplied in Jeet Kune Do,\n\n177\n00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.440\nin Bruce Lee's art of Jeet Kune Do.\n\n178\n00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:22.921\nWhich really doesn't come out\nof a Chinese Kung Fu at all.\n\n179\n00:11:22.921 --> 00:11:27.890\nIt comes from Western fencing I've\n\n180\n00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:32.700\nfound 1800 fencing manuals.\n\n181\n00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.560\nWhich these have these concepts in there.\n\n182\n00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.930\nSo, jukado is actually probably\nmore a western product.\n\n183\n00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.700\nYou have a western thought\nthan an eastern thought.\n\n184\n00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.240\nThe idea is simply this that if\nafter you probing your opponent,\n\n185\n00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.010\nyou feel like you're faster than your\nopponent, you take the direct attack.\n\n186\n00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.620\nThe same thing goes with your\nsocial engineering exploit.\n\n187\n00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.980\nIf you feel like you can just\nwalk through the door, go!\n\n188\n00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.190\nWhen you feel like you really\ncan't measure up to that\n\n189\n00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.600\nyou need an indirect approach.\n\n190\n00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.640\nThe indirect approach is\ntypically faking low,\n\n191\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.990\ngetting the person to drop their\nhand while you go high, okay.\n\n192\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.120\nFaking right where you go left,\nfaking the leg where you go with the hand.\n\n193\n00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.635\nSo the indirect approach would\nbe to create an opening.\n\n194\n00:12:17.635 --> 00:12:22.565\nIn a social engineering exploit it\nwould be creating a commotion outside.\n\n195\n00:12:22.565 --> 00:12:25.595\nStarting a fire and\npulling the fire alarm.\n\n196\n00:12:25.595 --> 00:12:28.885\nI mean,\nall the above would be indirect attacks.\n\n197\n00:12:28.885 --> 00:12:29.795\nCreate commotion.\n\n198\n00:12:29.795 --> 00:12:31.645\nCreate havoc.\n\n199\n00:12:31.645 --> 00:12:33.985\nGet the CPUs running over.\n\n200\n00:12:33.985 --> 00:12:38.529\nA buffer overflow to\nthe entire management crew.\n\n201\n00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:45.098\nAnd while they're running around in chaos\nyou actually get the stuff you need.\n\n202\n00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.480\nSo the interactive approach really works.\n\n203\n00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.501\nThe trap is a kinda like that happens.\n\n204\n00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:53.540\nThe trap actually,\nwe call it immobilization.\n\n205\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.350\nSo you immobilize a person's arm,\n\n206\n00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:58.210\nyou trap their arm so\nthey can't come back with the move.\n\n207\n00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:02.070\nYou bump them off down so for\nthe moment when a person is off balance,\n\n208\n00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:06.290\nthey have no structure, they have no\nvertical line or force to use, so,\n\n209\n00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.830\nas long as a person is off-balance,\nthey really can't do anything.\n\n210\n00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.460\nSo if you\n>> So if a guard is watching a door and\n\n211\n00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.950\nyou pay a couple of kids to start\na fist fight out in the hallway.\n\n212\n00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:19.035\n>> That would be, yeah, that would be,\nreally a forward immobilization.\n\n213\n00:13:19.035 --> 00:13:24.326\nIn a sense, the indirect attack is kind of\nlike an immobilization at the same time.\n\n214\n00:13:24.326 --> 00:13:25.192\nAlmost like cousins.\n\n215\n00:13:25.192 --> 00:13:26.870\n>> Certainly everybody's running around.\n\n216\n00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:27.670\nYeah, cousins.\n\n217\n00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.910\nWell the thing is the dynamic so\n\n218\n00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:33.950\nthat certainly the most direct\nway is always the way to go.\n\n219\n00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:38.748\nBut if you, your spider senses\ntell you its not then you want to\n\n220\n00:13:38.748 --> 00:13:42.455\nnow use the technology\nof the angles of attack.\n\n221\n00:13:42.455 --> 00:13:46.518\nThere's the draw attack.\n\n222\n00:13:46.518 --> 00:13:49.530\nSo the draw attack might be for\na person to, for\n\n223\n00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.790\nyou to make a mistake to draw them out so\nthat they have helped you.\n\n224\n00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.410\nThe draw attack might be also starting\na fire outside so that they all run out so\n\n225\n00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:58.420\nthat you go in.\n\n226\n00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.810\nAnd so they're going one way,\nyou're going another way.\n\n227\n00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.317\nSo the draw tax is really kind\nof an interesting approach and\n\n228\n00:14:04.317 --> 00:14:05.447\na way to do things.\n\n229\n00:14:05.447 --> 00:14:10.285\nAs well, as we move along this angle,\nthis approach,\n\n230\n00:14:10.285 --> 00:14:14.401\nthese attitudes, there's a timing attack.\n\n231\n00:14:14.401 --> 00:14:19.359\nOkay, so the timing attack I see more\nexamples of it in baseball, but the timing\n\n232\n00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:24.410\nis like You know, you don't want to\nthrow too many questions at somebody.\n\n233\n00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:30.160\nYou want to illicit the information\nat a pace that works for that person.\n\n234\n00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.330\nYou need to time yourself with them.\n\n235\n00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:37.430\nYour breathe needs to be in\nsynchronization with them,\n\n236\n00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.650\nyour voice, your pattern, your tone.\n\n237\n00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.510\nAll that needs to be in synchronization.\n\n238\n00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.620\nSo timing kinda plays\nan important part of that.\n\n239\n00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.790\nBut in martial arts,\ntiming is interesting.\n\n240\n00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:52.720\nA person could be relatively slow,\nrelatively out of shape, but\n\n241\n00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.920\nif they have, they understand timing,\nthey'll come out on top every time.\n\n242\n00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.260\nSo because they didn't see the patterns\non the person's rhythm and\n\n243\n00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.660\nhow to exploit the holes.\n\n244\n00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.670\n>> The timing is about anticipation.\n\n245\n00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:11.650\nIt's predicting when things are going to\noccur and then having it come out correct.\n\n246\n00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.540\n>> It is a prediction but\nthe same time it's an instinct and\n\n247\n00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.840\nit's more like crossing\nthe street in traffic, okay?\n\n248\n00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.590\nYou have a judgement of how\nfast those cars are coming,\n\n249\n00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.882\nyou see the whole, it's time to go.\n\n250\n00:15:22.882 --> 00:15:27.850\nSometimes, [LAUGH], you're timing\ngot to be right, in a situation,\n\n251\n00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.430\nyour timing really should be right,\n\n252\n00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:33.740\nbut really I think driving is probably one\nof the greatest examples of timing because\n\n253\n00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.750\nwhen it's time to pass somebody\nwhen to get out of a lane.\n\n254\n00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:43.370\nAnd you need to be able to time those\nthings because it's a dangerous affair.\n\n255\n00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:47.939\nWe take it rather lightly, but\nyou could be wiped out at any point.\n\n256\n00:15:47.939 --> 00:15:48.623\n>> Any point.\n\n257\n00:15:48.623 --> 00:15:50.781\n>> I think of the NFL quarterback, right?\n\n258\n00:15:50.781 --> 00:15:53.816\nHe's got a receiver that's\ngonna run a pattern, and\n\n259\n00:15:53.816 --> 00:15:58.215\nhe's throwing the ball to where\nthe receiver should be, not where he's at.\n\n260\n00:15:58.215 --> 00:16:01.866\nSo that eventually,\nas the receiver runs to- The pattern,\n\n261\n00:16:01.866 --> 00:16:04.382\nthe ball is there waiting for [CROSSTALK].\n\n262\n00:16:04.382 --> 00:16:09.107\n>> And how that timing works, because\nthey practice that routine, and routine,\n\n263\n00:16:09.107 --> 00:16:09.750\nroutine.\n\n264\n00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:14.705\nBut they're so in sync with each other,\nthey're like almost one mind.\n\n265\n00:16:14.705 --> 00:16:17.740\nSo, there you have it, okay?\n\n266\n00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.098\nA breakdown of\nBruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do and\n\n267\n00:16:20.098 --> 00:16:22.335\nhow it can apply to social engineering.\n\n268\n00:16:22.335 --> 00:16:24.730\nOkay?\n\n269\n00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.058\nSo what we'd like to do at\nthis point is actually,\n\n270\n00:16:28.058 --> 00:16:32.655\nwe can drop to the graph, and\nI'm gonna talk about a, I don't know,\n\n271\n00:16:32.655 --> 00:16:35.779\na kind of interesting\npen test that happened.\n\n272\n00:16:35.779 --> 00:16:39.864\nBut I want to go back and just look\nat one of the videos that we did,\n\n273\n00:16:39.864 --> 00:16:43.450\nwhich is the exterminator,\nthe Begone exterminator.\n\n274\n00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.287\nAnd then I'm gonna show you really\nwhere the thinking of that came about.\n\n275\n00:16:47.287 --> 00:16:51.100\nAnd we'll look at some of the elements and\nconcepts that we have in there.\n\n276\n00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.916\nOkay, so if we could roll.\n\n277\n00:16:52.916 --> 00:16:56.614\n[SOUND]\n>> Hi,\n\n278\n00:16:56.614 --> 00:16:59.685\nthis is James Smith from\nBegone Extermination.\n\n279\n00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:04.025\nI just wanted to tell you how good our\nservice is and how low our prices are.\n\n280\n00:17:04.025 --> 00:17:05.845\nAre you in need of extermination services?\n\n281\n00:17:07.105 --> 00:17:09.955\n>> No,\nwe have a company that does that already.\n\n282\n00:17:09.955 --> 00:17:10.505\n>> Well, I see.\nAnd\n\n283\n00:17:10.505 --> 00:17:12.615\nI'm sure you're very\nhappy with their service,\n\n284\n00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:15.450\nbut do they guarantee that\nyou will be pest free?\n\n285\n00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:16.400\n>> No.\n\n286\n00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.270\n>> Do they provide you with\na checklist of all the areas in your\n\n287\n00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.400\nbuilding that can be hotspots for pests?\n\n288\n00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.520\n>> Well, they seem to be pretty thorough.\n\n289\n00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.250\n>> Do they offer safe,\nnon-toxic alternatives for pest control?\n\n290\n00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.170\n>> I think so.\n\n291\n00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:31.880\n>> Well, who is this company that\ncan offer such exceptional service?\n\n292\n00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.600\n>> They're called Pest Away.\n\n293\n00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.440\n>> Would you be interested in our sales\nperson making a visit to show you how\n\n294\n00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.940\nour services are exceptional?\n\n295\n00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:38.530\n>> I don't know.\n\n296\n00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.670\nI can't make that decision.\n\n297\n00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.750\nYou'll have to call back\nwhen the boss is here.\n\n298\n00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:42.410\n>> And what's the boss's name?\n\n299\n00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.920\n>> Mrs. Jones, and\nshe's in after lunch most days.\n\n300\n00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.452\n>> Well, thank you for your time.\n\n301\n00:17:47.452 --> 00:17:48.540\nAnd your name is?\n\n302\n00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.528\n>> Marty.\n>> Well, thank you, Marty,\n\n303\n00:17:49.528 --> 00:17:50.060\nand you have a good day.\n\n304\n00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:55.062\n[SOUND].\n\n305\n00:17:55.062 --> 00:17:57.080\nHi, I'm looking for Marty.\n\n306\n00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.240\nI'm here to do some spraying and\nsetting up some mice traps.\n\n307\n00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:00.982\n>> What a coincidence.\nYou know,\n\n308\n00:18:00.982 --> 00:18:04.040\nanother company called trying\nto horn in on your job.\n\n309\n00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.360\n>> Yeah, who was that?\n\n310\n00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.670\n>> I think they were called Begone,\nor be something.\n\n311\n00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.450\n>> Yes, they seem to be\nafter all of our customers.\n\n312\n00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:12.800\nWell, can you show me around?\n\n313\n00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.930\nFrom what my report says, you have some\nmice in your server room, it looks like?\n\n314\n00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:17.430\n>> Sure, follow me.\n\n315\n00:18:33.892 --> 00:18:42.138\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, the laugh's the best part.\n\n316\n00:18:42.138 --> 00:18:44.485\n>> Yeah, the little maniacal man.\n\n317\n00:18:44.485 --> 00:18:49.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, in\n\n318\n00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:54.430\nthis particular pen test,\nthe pen tester was named Daniel.\n\n319\n00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:01.590\nSo Daniel had to get\nsocial media information\n\n320\n00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:06.140\non employees, try to get as many\nemployee names as he could,\n\n321\n00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:10.130\nmaybe some passwords and user names.\n\n322\n00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:15.110\nHe was certainly charged with getting\nas much email information and\n\n323\n00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.560\nas much data really as he could.\n\n324\n00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.960\nSo it was pretty much the goal.\n\n325\n00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:24.940\nSo Daniel felt maybe the best way to\ngo would start with dumpster diving.\n\n326\n00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:31.200\nBut when he goes to the site, he sees\nthat the dumpsters are all locked up, and\n\n327\n00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:31.880\nguarded.\n\n328\n00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:38.320\nThere actually was a guard at\nthe gate he had to go through, so\n\n329\n00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.640\nit looked really next to impossible.\n\n330\n00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.593\nSo he thinks about the whole thing and\nhe goes, hey,\n\n331\n00:19:46.812 --> 00:19:54.280\nLet me find us some information about, let\nme pose as a waste management salesman.\n\n332\n00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.157\nSo he calls them up, and he goes,\nhi, this is Daniel from,\n\n333\n00:19:58.157 --> 00:20:01.119\nhe disguises his voice and name, actually.\n\n334\n00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:06.900\nBut, this is Daniel from\nABC Waste Management,\n\n335\n00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.143\nand I'm really looking for\n\n336\n00:20:10.143 --> 00:20:15.219\nsomeone I can talk to\nabout the services and\n\n337\n00:20:15.219 --> 00:20:20.299\nwaste management utilities that we have.\n\n338\n00:20:20.299 --> 00:20:23.383\nWho would I be able to talk to?\n\n339\n00:20:23.383 --> 00:20:27.750\nAnd he gets talking to the front desk\nreceptionist, and he says, yeah,\n\n340\n00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.480\nwe have a really great plan.\n\n341\n00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.050\nI think that you'd really\nbe happy with our service.\n\n342\n00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:33.910\nAnd she's like, yeah, but\nwe're already covered.\n\n343\n00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:41.730\nWe have another company XYZ who comes in.\n\n344\n00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:42.350\nXYZ.\n\n345\n00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:44.530\nSo he digs a little further.\n\n346\n00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:48.620\nAnd he goes, hey, what times do\nthey do their pickups, and so on?\n\n347\n00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:49.780\nHow many times a week do they do it?\n\n348\n00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.659\nAnd she's, they're in Mondays and\nThursdays.\n\n349\n00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.844\nSo he takes all that\ninformation in stride.\n\n350\n00:20:55.844 --> 00:20:59.330\nAnd he kinda looks up the company and\nhe gets the logo.\n\n351\n00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.956\nMakes himself up an actual uniform,\ngets a T-shirt printed.\n\n352\n00:21:02.956 --> 00:21:09.170\nAnd he's got the hat and\nhe's got all the pretexting material.\n\n353\n00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:13.830\nSo, so far,\nhe has now elicited information,\n\n354\n00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.950\nhe's now setting up a pretext.\n\n355\n00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:21.034\nHe says, he calls back up and\nhe says, look,\n\n356\n00:21:21.034 --> 00:21:25.762\nthis is Daniel again from\nABC Waste Management, and\n\n357\n00:21:25.762 --> 00:21:33.190\nwe understand that there's a damaged\ndumpster that we're gonna have to look at.\n\n358\n00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.940\nI just want you to tell the guard that\n\n359\n00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.210\nwe're gonna be coming in Thursday\nnight to take a look at a that.\n\n360\n00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:42.390\nAnd she goes, okay,\nI'll let the guard know.\n\n361\n00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:45.294\nAnd when he hits the gate,\nguard's expecting him,\n\n362\n00:21:45.294 --> 00:21:47.220\nkinds of waves him on through.\n\n363\n00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.583\nAnd then he goes in, he kind of goes into\nthe dumpster, he kind of checks it out,\n\n364\n00:21:50.583 --> 00:21:52.557\nand he's kind of looking\nat all the material.\n\n365\n00:21:52.557 --> 00:21:59.251\nAnd sure enough, as he goes through\nthe dumpster, he finds USB drives,\n\n366\n00:21:59.251 --> 00:22:05.089\nCDs, DVDs, certainly a lot of\nshredded paper, and whatnot.\n\n367\n00:22:05.089 --> 00:22:10.304\nBut those USB drives actually had\npertinent information in there\n\n368\n00:22:10.304 --> 00:22:15.916\nthat allowed him to actually then\nfind who the IT support company was.\n\n369\n00:22:15.916 --> 00:22:18.150\nThere were names.\n\n370\n00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:23.710\nAnd he actually had the IT support\ncontract, so he was able to\n\n371\n00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:29.080\nactually come back later under the guise\nas an IT support representative,\n\n372\n00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:34.630\nget into the building,\nplant a backdoor on somebody's machine,\n\n373\n00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.560\nscan the network,\ngather the information, and\n\n374\n00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:42.960\nit all came about simply by this\npretexting and elicitation.\n\n375\n00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:45.970\n>> It's a pretty clever attack,\nthat's for sure.\n\n376\n00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:46.710\n>> It's a pretty clever attack.\n\n377\n00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.214\nThat's why I wanted to really\npull this one back up.\n\n378\n00:22:48.214 --> 00:22:50.290\n>> It's also very involved, right?\n\n379\n00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:54.361\nThis is a lot of planning and resources\nthat you're gonna have to take to,\n\n380\n00:22:54.361 --> 00:22:55.682\nget shirts printed up.\n\n381\n00:22:55.682 --> 00:23:01.360\nThere's a lot of thought involved\nwith putting this pretext into play.\n\n382\n00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:06.510\nBut again, I guess the more invested\nyou are into the actual social\n\n383\n00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:11.291\nengineering attack, the better responses\nyou're going to elicit, I would assume.\n\n384\n00:23:11.291 --> 00:23:12.062\n>> Without a doubt.\nIn fact,\n\n385\n00:23:12.062 --> 00:23:16.500\nthat's why I want you to\nlook at it as a dynamic.\n\n386\n00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:21.470\nIf any of those elements are missing,\nyou don't have the right pretext,\n\n387\n00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:26.890\nmaybe you're not the right person,\nyou haven't really influenced that person,\n\n388\n00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.640\nor you haven't really understood\ntheir personality type.\n\n389\n00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.470\nWe kind of went through all the\nphysiological principles, but as we come\n\n390\n00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:38.080\nthrough the next module, which is going\nto be remediation, we're gonna look at\n\n391\n00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:43.866\npersonality types and those influences and\nhow we can better align those things.\n\n392\n00:23:43.866 --> 00:23:44.366\nSo.\n\n393\n00:23:46.334 --> 00:23:51.369\nI think, really, that's pretty\n\n394\n00:23:51.369 --> 00:23:56.239\nmuch what we have for that point.\n\n395\n00:23:56.239 --> 00:23:59.574\nWe have the information,\nwe've [INAUDIBLE],\n\n396\n00:23:59.574 --> 00:24:05.120\nI mean, Simply we have the attack and\nthe cycle that we approach it.\n\n397\n00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:11.597\nYeah, so I am not sure what more I\ncan really add to the attack phase.\n\n398\n00:24:11.597 --> 00:24:15.400\n>> Its really simplistic to be honest\nwith you, when you put it down.\n\n399\n00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.873\nYou just have to have\na good plan of attack.\n\n400\n00:24:16.873 --> 00:24:21.753\nYou've given us different ways in which\nwe need to think about the attack cycle,\n\n401\n00:24:21.753 --> 00:24:25.650\ndefinitely that it's fluid,\nthat we're going to do recount.\n\n402\n00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:31.140\nWe're going to maybe come at\nit with types of feints or\n\n403\n00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.588\nprobing and\nthen readjust based on how that reacts and\n\n404\n00:24:34.588 --> 00:24:39.070\nit's always fluidly changing and moving\nand we need to be able to move with it and\n\n405\n00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:44.261\nreconstruct our attacks so\nthat they are going to be more illicitus.\n\n406\n00:24:44.261 --> 00:24:46.890\n[LAUGH]\n>> Illicitus, without a doubt.\n\n407\n00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:53.360\nBut I can't really put enough\nemphasis on your information phase.\n\n408\n00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.510\nThe information phase could go on for\na month.\n\n409\n00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.930\nThere's no reason why it wouldn't.\n\n410\n00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:58.950\nThe gathering phase,\n\n411\n00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:05.020\nthe harvesting phase is actually\nthe longest part of the actual attack.\n\n412\n00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.050\n>> Cuz you have to build up enough.\n\n413\n00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:11.880\n>> You have to build up enough foundation\nto really build the right approach to it.\n\n414\n00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.790\nThe actual attack, the attack\nreally shouldn't take that long.\n\n415\n00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:21.644\nUnless you're after what you would\nconsider an advanced persistent threat\n\n416\n00:25:21.644 --> 00:25:26.870\ntype attack where you're going to stay\nin the network for a period of time.\n\n417\n00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.430\nAlso that you may be able\nto move out to partners and\n\n418\n00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:34.420\ngather more information about their\ngoings on, to plan even a bigger attack.\n\n419\n00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.487\n>> This would be more like embedding\nyourself into their system, so\n\n420\n00:25:37.487 --> 00:25:38.890\nthat you become trusted and.\n\n421\n00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:42.370\n>> Right, but see that's basically\nhow a real attack is happening.\n\n422\n00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:46.250\nSo, the real attack isn't like,\nthey are spending plenty of time gaining\n\n423\n00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.580\ninformation but\nthey're planning a bigger attack.\n\n424\n00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.200\nThe social engineer really is going,\nhey, how secure are they?\n\n425\n00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.270\nWe wanna really test them to see\nwhat their capabilities are,\n\n426\n00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:58.620\nhow do they respond?\n\n427\n00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.540\nHow many people clicked on the e-mail?\n\n428\n00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:05.060\nHow many people really took\na bite on the phone probes?\n\n429\n00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:09.970\nHow many people we got\nclicking on the SMS messages?\n\n430\n00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:11.490\nAnd how many people let me\nthrough the front door?\n\n431\n00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.670\nIt's pretty dang easy.\n\n432\n00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:16.350\nIn fact, I don't have a pass here,\n\n433\n00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:18.930\nbut somebody's let me\nthrough the door every day.\n\n434\n00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:19.500\n>> We trust you.\n\n435\n00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.100\n>> Yeah.\n\n436\n00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.160\nHe's got that face.\n\n437\n00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.280\n>> Trust me, why not!\n\n438\n00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.380\n>> Right?\n>> Who wouldn't trust\n\n439\n00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.820\na face like that, right?\n\n440\n00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:29.200\nYou know it's funny, we're talking about,\nas social engineers, as a job I worked at,\n\n441\n00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:34.180\nwe had a real problem with users\ngoing after phishing sites, right?\n\n442\n00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.740\nThey would get emails, click this link,\ncome and check this out, and\n\n443\n00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.170\nman, if they wouldn't click on that link.\n\n444\n00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:42.700\nAnd we send them to user training,\neverything we could think of,\n\n445\n00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:46.060\npeople continued to do this\nwithout even regard, right?\n\n446\n00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.280\nSo we developed our own phishing\nsite that would basically,\n\n447\n00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.910\nrandomly send out to\nusers in our own network.\n\n448\n00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.380\nAnd say, hey click on this site.\n\n449\n00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:00.400\nAnd if they clicked on it,\nyeah this is IT from your company.\n\n450\n00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.540\nWe told you not to do this.\n\n451\n00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.230\nYou did it anyway.\n\n452\n00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:04.660\nWe caught you doing it red-handed.\n\n453\n00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.450\nAnd now we're gonna have\na face to face with you.\n\n454\n00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:07.680\nYou gotta take this seriously.\n\n455\n00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:13.280\n>> Did you have a policy in terms\nof what the punishment would be,\n\n456\n00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.690\nor was there any reprimand,\nI mean what happened when people did that?\n\n457\n00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:19.920\n>> I believe that there\nwas some sort of official\n\n458\n00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.460\nface to face with some of them from HR.\n\n459\n00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.505\nRight yes that's a little hand slapping.\n\n460\n00:27:25.505 --> 00:27:26.165\nSaying, now, now, now!\n\n461\n00:27:26.165 --> 00:27:27.730\n>> See, yeah, and that's the cure.\n\n462\n00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.615\nSure, people are doing it, but\nthere's no way to check on it.\n\n463\n00:27:30.615 --> 00:27:33.815\n>> Right.\n>> And, they're not gonna tell anybody.\n\n464\n00:27:33.815 --> 00:27:34.335\n>> Right.\n\n465\n00:27:34.335 --> 00:27:37.950\n>> I mean, we know that companies\nout there actually have been had,\n\n466\n00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:40.385\naren't disclosing it because.\n\n467\n00:27:40.385 --> 00:27:41.255\n>> It makes them look bad.\n\n468\n00:27:41.255 --> 00:27:42.585\n>> Yeah.\nMakes them feel\n\n469\n00:27:42.585 --> 00:27:44.965\nthat it's gonna tarnish their reputation.\n\n470\n00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.400\nBut testing is an important thing.\n\n471\n00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:48.980\n>> That's true.\n\n472\n00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:49.880\n>> Yeah.\n>> Well Tom,\n\n473\n00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.910\nattack cycle, it's in the can,\nI'm looking at the clock.\n\n474\n00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:55.400\nWe are down to a very small\namount of time left and\n\n475\n00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.139\nI do appreciate you stopping by and\nexplaining the attack cycle for us so\n\n476\n00:27:59.139 --> 00:28:02.650\nthat we understand it as we become\nsocial engineers ourselves.\n\n477\n00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:03.700\n>> Excellent, great.\n\n478\n00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.100\n>> But that being said, I guess we'll\ngo ahead and sign off for ITProTV.\n\n479\n00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.960\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n480\n00:28:08.960 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.368 --> 00:00:20.400\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are continuing on with\n\n4\n00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.820\nmore of our social engineering content.\n\n5\n00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.310\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday to talk about remediation\n\n6\n00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.170\nis our good friend, Mr. Tom Updegrove.\n\n7\n00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.560\nTom, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n8\n00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.220\nWe're so glad-.\n\n9\n00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.190\n>> I'm thrilled to be back here.\n\n10\n00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.450\nThrilled to be back.\n\n11\n00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.750\n>> So remediation.\n\n12\n00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.000\nRemediation.\n\n13\n00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.990\nBasically, remediation is\na self-defense for your network.\n\n14\n00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.100\nSelf defense for your company and-\n>> This is our company and\n\n15\n00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.800\nnetwork kung fu, if you will.\n\n16\n00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.900\n>> Yeah, we call it that.\n\n17\n00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.740\nIn fact, even the term, in fact,\nit's interesting we bring it up.\n\n18\n00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.160\nSo gung fu, or kung fu,\ndepends on the dialect you use okay?\n\n19\n00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.490\nIt had nothing to do with fighting or\nself defense.\n\n20\n00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.550\nIt actually means time and\neffort spent to develop.\n\n21\n00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.490\nIt means work, effort, and so\n\n22\n00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.689\nfor one to be gung fu\nwould mean that they've\n\n23\n00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.570\ndone their due diligence in terms\nof finding out what the areas\n\n24\n00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:33.530\nof disclosure are then actually both\nnot only from the physical level right?\n\n25\n00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.020\nCertainly from the technical level,\nthe data level.\n\n26\n00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.780\nOkay?\n\n27\n00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.880\nThen, his wells from the human level.\n\n28\n00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.860\nRight?\n\n29\n00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.296\nFrom the human level, we want to\nunderstand the three big vectors, right?\n\n30\n00:01:47.296 --> 00:01:51.950\nThe person-to-person, the vis-a-vis,\n\n31\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.460\nthe telephone, okay, and then the email.\n\n32\n00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.150\nAnd I was gonna say under email,\n\n33\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.300\nI'm still gonna talk about SMS messaging,\nand MMS messaging.\n\n34\n00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.630\nIt's a form of email or\nelectronic messaging.\n\n35\n00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.350\nSo they all kind of come together.\n\n36\n00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.690\nThose are the three big vectors,\nthe ones we want.\n\n37\n00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.440\nI think, as a self defense expert,\n\n38\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.500\nas a IT security expert,\nI see a lot of similarities in there.\n\n39\n00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.025\nThe first one is really social proof,\n\n40\n00:02:28.025 --> 00:02:34.305\nor well,\nwhy do I really have to worry about it?\n\n41\n00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:39.715\nIt's like, it's not my money, or\nit's not my company, but you really need\n\n42\n00:02:40.945 --> 00:02:46.005\nto develop an attitude\nthat it can happen to you.\n\n43\n00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:47.975\nSo you need acceptance, number one.\n\n44\n00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:51.950\nAccept that something\ncan happen to you that\n\n45\n00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.720\nyou wanna do something about it, and\nthen that starts you on your path.\n\n46\n00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.640\nYour second principle is awareness.\n\n47\n00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.640\nWhat I say to people is when it comes to\nself defence training is you have eyes for\n\n48\n00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.520\nawareness.\n\n49\n00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.790\nYou want to see what's around you.\n\n50\n00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.400\nYou want to see what\nthe potential dangers are.\n\n51\n00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.910\nWe should have eyes for awareness when\nwe're traveling, when we're in route,\n\n52\n00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.220\nwhen we're in airport,\nwhen we're on the highway driving.\n\n53\n00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.350\nWe need eyes for awareness.\n\n54\n00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.170\nWe need eyes for awareness,\ncertainly, when we're working.\n\n55\n00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.590\nAnd, I tell you, today it's even worse,\nbecause in most cases,\n\n56\n00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.560\nlike I said, when I'm on the train,\neverybody's looking at their phone, and\n\n57\n00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.260\nnobody's paying attention.\n\n58\n00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.990\nSo mobile devices can be a real detriment\nto developing a sense of awareness.\n\n59\n00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.670\nI stopped at a restaurant today for lunch,\n\n60\n00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.660\nand everybody's sitting there\nlooking at their phones.\n\n61\n00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.210\nSome in the back,\non their computer, headphones on.\n\n62\n00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.530\nThey don't know.\n\n63\n00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.630\nAnd so it's important that you\ndevelop that sense of awareness.\n\n64\n00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.700\n>> I've always heard the term\na head on a swivel right?\n\n65\n00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.640\nKeep your head on a swivel.\n\n66\n00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.052\nIt's always scanning and engaging\nwhat's over here, what's over there.\n\n67\n00:04:06.052 --> 00:04:10.744\nWhat's behind me, and continually\nrescanning the area for any potential\n\n68\n00:04:10.744 --> 00:04:15.213\nthreats or anything that could harm\nyour person or harm somebody else,\n\n69\n00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:20.202\nif you're on the lookout, you're being\nproactive, like scanning the area,\n\n70\n00:04:20.202 --> 00:04:25.440\nthen you're less likely to be affected\nnegatively by something that might occur.\n\n71\n00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.141\n>> I like that.\n\n72\n00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:28.105\nI like that a lot.\n\n73\n00:04:28.105 --> 00:04:34.260\nSo as eyes and ears,\nturn on your sixth sense.\n\n74\n00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.780\nWhat is the sixth sense?\n\n75\n00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.560\nReally, the combination of\nall the other senses, okay.\n\n76\n00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.080\nYour feeling,\nit's really that feeling in your stomach,\n\n77\n00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.870\nabout what's going on, but\njust think of all those combined.\n\n78\n00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.220\nAnd most importantly, your common sense.\n\n79\n00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.890\nAnd don't let your common sense go out\nthe window, think practical about it.\n\n80\n00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.890\nAnd I think that if you take those\nelements into consideration,\n\n81\n00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.880\nwe'll all be much better.\n\n82\n00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.410\nOf course, there's some other\nconcepts that go along, but\n\n83\n00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.790\nwe have a video that\nwe're going to bring out.\n\n84\n00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.250\nIn fact this is, I think,\nmight even be the best,\n\n85\n00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.940\nat least Peter feels it's the best, okay?\n\n86\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.150\nSo that's where all that little\nvignette will come back.\n\n87\n00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.630\n>> Hey buddy, do you work at Global Tech?\n\n88\n00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.830\n>> Yeah, I work in the IT Department.\n\n89\n00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.090\nDo I know you?\n\n90\n00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.680\n>> My gosh, IT?\n\n91\n00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.540\nBoy, that boss, what do you think of him?\n\n92\n00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.242\n>> God, he's the worst.\n\n93\n00:05:34.242 --> 00:05:36.184\n>> I know, right?\n\n94\n00:05:36.184 --> 00:05:36.926\nMy goodness.\n\n95\n00:05:36.926 --> 00:05:41.246\nDid we just become best friends?\n\n96\n00:05:41.246 --> 00:05:51.246\n[MUSIC]\n\n97\n00:06:10.347 --> 00:06:13.237\nYeah, so anyway, the CEO comes in, and\n\n98\n00:06:13.237 --> 00:06:17.525\nhe tells me his password is\njust his dog's name, Fluffy.\n\n99\n00:06:17.525 --> 00:06:19.025\nCan you believe that?\n\n100\n00:06:19.025 --> 00:06:21.725\nYeah, I told him to change it,\nbut I know he won't.\n\n101\n00:06:21.725 --> 00:06:24.255\nAnd he's got access to\nall the sensitive data.\n\n102\n00:06:26.706 --> 00:06:27.756\nHey.\n>> I like that.\n\n103\n00:06:27.756 --> 00:06:29.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I like that little close out,\n\n104\n00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.100\nthat was good.\n\n105\n00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.010\n>> Right, nice little fade off.\n\n106\n00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.480\n>> Fade, yeah.\n>> Into the distance.\n\n107\n00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.340\n>> Fade in.\n\n108\n00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.950\n>> So, we've got these two guys,\n\n109\n00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.300\none of them obviously approaches\nthe other and strikes up a conversation.\n\n110\n00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.330\nAnd, through that, it seems like\nhe is trying to befriend this man.\n\n111\n00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.350\nThey become, best friends, as it were.\n\n112\n00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.410\nAnd, through that friendship,\n\n113\n00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.260\nhe is then therefore able to\nillicit information out of them.\n\n114\n00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.860\n>> Illicit information, right.\n\n115\n00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.020\nAnd I'm sure this happens quite often.\n\n116\n00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.430\nSo in order to get around that\nwe need training sessions.\n\n117\n00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.260\nThere I go back to\nthe martial art analogy.\n\n118\n00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:12.080\nThe only way I can teach somebody self\ndefense physically, is to attack them.\n\n119\n00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.090\nI start it light.\n\n120\n00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.750\nI just give them that light hold.\n\n121\n00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.430\nThen I give them a little heavier hold.\n\n122\n00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:25.027\nThen I'm going to put it on as strong as\nI can, see if they can break out of it.\n\n123\n00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:27.102\nAnd I think the same thing goes with here.\n\n124\n00:07:27.102 --> 00:07:32.458\nYou can't do a full over-the-board\npenetration test, but\n\n125\n00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:37.608\nyou can start to practice with\nemails with your employees,\n\n126\n00:07:37.608 --> 00:07:41.213\nyou can start working on terms of phones,\n\n127\n00:07:41.213 --> 00:07:46.466\nyou can test them at the front desk,\nyou can test the guards,\n\n128\n00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:52.646\nyou can test the surveillance system\nby having certain events happen,\n\n129\n00:07:52.646 --> 00:07:56.359\nand then seeing if they\ncan recall them so.\n\n130\n00:07:56.359 --> 00:08:00.566\nThis all should really be part\nof your countermeasures, and\n\n131\n00:08:00.566 --> 00:08:05.111\ncountermeasures is an important\npart of what we're going to do.\n\n132\n00:08:05.111 --> 00:08:10.279\nOther things we can do are two way or\ntwo double factor\n\n133\n00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:15.685\nauthentication at password\nstealing seems to be one of\n\n134\n00:08:15.685 --> 00:08:21.343\nthe important attributes that\npeople are trying to get.\n\n135\n00:08:21.343 --> 00:08:26.800\nBut two fact authentication\ncan certainly slow that down.\n\n136\n00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.650\nIt's not that it can't be bypassed but\nit makes it a lot harder.\n\n137\n00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.951\nAnd I think just watch\ncombining all of your address\n\n138\n00:08:34.951 --> 00:08:39.410\nbooks into multiple accounts more or less.\n\n139\n00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:43.060\nYou don't necessarily need to combine\nyour Facebook with your LinkedIn,\n\n140\n00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:49.660\nwith you Twitter, with your SnapChat,\ntry to keep those things separate.\n\n141\n00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.300\nIt's more convenient to do that,\nthey would like you to do that,\n\n142\n00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.340\nbut it's not good for\nyour personal privacy.\n\n143\n00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.288\n>> Yeah I would say they even go as far\nas to make it almost impossible for\n\n144\n00:09:01.288 --> 00:09:02.410\nyou to not do that.\n\n145\n00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:06.610\nThey make it so difficult that if you're\nnot engaging in that kind of activity,\n\n146\n00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:10.510\nthen you're gonna have a much more\ndifficult time using their products.\n\n147\n00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:14.220\nAnd we're almost building\na society that is ripe for\n\n148\n00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.700\nthe picking of a social engineer,\njust because of the way that\n\n149\n00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:23.220\nwe are trying to make things much\nmore convenient for ourselves.\n\n150\n00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.080\n>> Right.\n\n151\n00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:32.470\nSo what I have is a thing called\nthe ABCD method of security awareness.\n\n152\n00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:33.959\nAnd the first is awareness.\n\n153\n00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.340\nSecond is baseline, so\n\n154\n00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.090\nwe went back to this at the beginning,\nwhat is your level of security?\n\n155\n00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.218\nWhere is at at?\n\n156\n00:09:41.218 --> 00:09:45.600\nEven if you're going to\ndo a social engineering\n\n157\n00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:54.690\nexploit, not an exploit but if you're\ncharged with finding the level of security\n\n158\n00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:59.380\nand social engineering is gonna be part of\nthat, you need to know where they stand at\n\n159\n00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.860\nfirst and then be able to measure that\nas to how effectively they train.\n\n160\n00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:10.000\nMaybe your task is really only to\nchallenge the level of security.\n\n161\n00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.100\nBut it may be to go to the next step and\nto actually to improve it.\n\n162\n00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.610\nSo you need to know where you started,\nwhere you're gonna wind up and\n\n163\n00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.770\nhow that secretes and\nhave some metric for that.\n\n164\n00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.189\nAlong with that you need creative ideas.\n\n165\n00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:30.370\nSo once you've got an understanding\nof where the levels are.\n\n166\n00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:35.240\nSo, C would stand for creative ideas or\nget everyone involved.\n\n167\n00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.040\nGet a committee, get a group.\n\n168\n00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.860\nGet everybody's input.\n\n169\n00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.040\nThere's nothing, there's really,\nyou know how think tanks are,\n\n170\n00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.500\nthere's no idea that's really stupid.\n\n171\n00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.740\n>> Yeah.\n>> Everybody puts in,\n\n172\n00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.170\nnah, that's a dumb idea.\n\n173\n00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:53.304\nBut really you need to be able\nto have everyone involved and\n\n174\n00:10:53.304 --> 00:10:56.275\neverybody's input.\n\n175\n00:10:56.275 --> 00:10:59.590\nAt the same time you need\nto be able to structure and\n\n176\n00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.770\nunderstand how social groups work.\n\n177\n00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.070\nSocial groups always will have an outlier.\n\n178\n00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.380\nOr outliers so you need to be able to\nidentify that if you're that person.\n\n179\n00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.430\nSo I actually would do that.\n\n180\n00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.440\nI found that some of the greatest\ncoaches are that way.\n\n181\n00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:20.120\nCoaches will take their team and they'll\nactually kind of map out in a chart\n\n182\n00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.370\nwho's closer to the core,\nwho's further out.\n\n183\n00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.230\nWhether you're inside or outside,\n\n184\n00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:34.000\nit tells you something about the approach\nand a way to deal with those people.\n\n185\n00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.580\nSo you're trying to\ndevelop dynamics in terms\n\n186\n00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:43.380\nof developing a mind set for\nself defense and cyber security.\n\n187\n00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.369\nAnd of course the last part\nwould be developing a plan,\n\n188\n00:11:49.369 --> 00:11:53.740\nso awareness, baseline be creative.\n\n189\n00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.400\nCome up with a plan.\n\n190\n00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.810\nAnd then implement the plan.\n\n191\n00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:58.700\n>> Now is the plan,\n\n192\n00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:03.750\nobviously, we've been talking about the\nfluidity of attacks, how things change.\n\n193\n00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:04.510\nThings are evolving.\n\n194\n00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.910\nThings are always moving.\n\n195\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:09.050\nI think an old philosopher said,\nyou never step in the same river twice.\n\n196\n00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:11.020\nThings will always changing.\n\n197\n00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.548\nThat water is different than when\nthe first time you put your foot into it.\n\n198\n00:12:14.548 --> 00:12:18.850\nAnd those plans obviously, I would\ntake it from what you've taught us so\n\n199\n00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.100\nfar, is that they should\nnever remain static.\n\n200\n00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:26.580\nWe should always be questioning the plan,\nre evaluating and re planning our plan.\n\n201\n00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.850\n>> You are so right, Daniel.\n\n202\n00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:28.825\n>> I can be taught.\n\n203\n00:12:28.825 --> 00:12:30.450\n[LAUGH]\n>> You are so right.\n\n204\n00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:35.940\nWell, most think that I put in a firewall,\nI've got antivirus,\n\n205\n00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.960\nwe're good.\n\n206\n00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.500\nWe're doing backups and\nnobody's checking the backups.\n\n207\n00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.430\nNobody's really watching\nthe firewall logs.\n\n208\n00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.860\nI mean, so that stuff's there,\nthat's what we were told to put in.\n\n209\n00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.500\nBut it needs to be monitored,\nit needs to be watched.\n\n210\n00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:56.950\nReally we know what best practices are,\nyou need to patch, patch, patch, patch.\n\n211\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.270\nYou need everything up to date,\nyou need to really be watching for\n\n212\n00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.440\nthe vulnerabilities in\nwhat's coming down the wire.\n\n213\n00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:09.260\nSo you really need the security expert\nthere looking at what's going on.\n\n214\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:16.980\nSo it is not just a one size fits all or\none approach to security's gonna work.\n\n215\n00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.220\nYou need, it's a process.\n\n216\n00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:23.930\nYou need to constantly keep working at\nit and evolving and growing with it.\n\n217\n00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:28.320\nChanging with the, with the actual\nattack vectors that are developing.\n\n218\n00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:34.060\n>> Now Tom a lot of times, well just about\nevery time the social engineer, the person\n\n219\n00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.710\nthat is trying to do our company harm,\ndo our network harm, do whatever.\n\n220\n00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.010\nTry and plan some attack against us.\n\n221\n00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.870\nThey look for that weakest link right?\n\n222\n00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.520\nWe're only as strong as\nour weakest link is so\n\n223\n00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.040\nwe can have all\nthe firewalls in the world.\n\n224\n00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.300\nWe can have all the anti\nvirus systems in the world.\n\n225\n00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.650\nIf I can find a user that'll plug\na USB drive in that downloads and\n\n226\n00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:59.090\ninstalls a listener for\nmy Metasploitable, or my\n\n227\n00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:05.160\nArmitage, or whatever is running,\nSET, what good is it?\n\n228\n00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.660\nI've basically just walked all\nbehind that and said, there you go.\n\n229\n00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.680\nEnjoy our network.\n\n230\n00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.360\n>> Without a doubt.\n\n231\n00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:16.170\nI mean, look, it's higher than 90% of\nattacks happen through human beings.\n\n232\n00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:21.784\nYou can't say, well, it's the human user,\nit's the user that is the problem.\n\n233\n00:14:21.784 --> 00:14:23.425\nNo, it's some users.\n\n234\n00:14:23.425 --> 00:14:23.937\n>> Right.\n\n235\n00:14:23.937 --> 00:14:28.400\n>> Some are, really, pretty good with\nit but you have to really isolate and\n\n236\n00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.190\nfind out who are the weak links.\n\n237\n00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:35.155\nWho's really the person more prone and\nwe've talked about it before a lot.\n\n238\n00:14:35.155 --> 00:14:40.715\nIt's either, you're gonna find probably\n80% of your people are great at it, okay.\n\n239\n00:14:40.715 --> 00:14:41.800\n20% could care less.\n\n240\n00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.970\nAnd the top 20% probably feel, well,\nit doesn't really matter to me.\n\n241\n00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.940\nI don't have to because\nI've got people watching.\n\n242\n00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.750\nI've got people,\nthey're taking care of things.\n\n243\n00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.220\n>> So I guess the question then\nis how do we remediate that.\n\n244\n00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.960\nHow do we get those people that\ncouldn't care less about doing\n\n245\n00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.290\nany type of security, or\nbeing on the look out, or being aware and\n\n246\n00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:09.510\nhow do we get them up to a level\nthat is compliant with what we need.\n\n247\n00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:15.220\n>> First we need that base line, second\nwe need to understand what is sensitive,\n\n248\n00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:21.830\nwhat we need to categorize our information\nas to what is extremely important,\n\n249\n00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:26.030\nour trade secrets, our customer lists.\n\n250\n00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:29.420\nAnd most companies, a lot of times HR,\n\n251\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:33.790\nthey don't wanna know what payroll,\nand what people are making.\n\n252\n00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.110\nI mean all.\n\n253\n00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.693\nYou need to identify\nthe sensitive information,\n\n254\n00:15:38.693 --> 00:15:42.200\nthen, you need to develop\na policy around that.\n\n255\n00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:48.310\nA policy should indicate\nreally what access,\n\n256\n00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:51.137\nwho can access what.\n\n257\n00:15:51.137 --> 00:15:56.562\nA policy should also have a standard\nin terms of if something should happen,\n\n258\n00:15:56.562 --> 00:15:59.270\nhow people should behave.\n\n259\n00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.840\nThe policy should say\nwhat the user should do.\n\n260\n00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:07.780\nThere should be a standard user\ncomputer use policy for the company.\n\n261\n00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.000\nI'm sure most do.\n\n262\n00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.270\nBut some don't.\n\n263\n00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:14.035\nI go in companies sometimes and\nit's like, do whatever.\n\n264\n00:16:14.035 --> 00:16:15.471\nOkay?\n\n265\n00:16:15.471 --> 00:16:23.414\nAnd you find people, most of the time I\nfind people playing cards or something.\n\n266\n00:16:23.414 --> 00:16:26.186\nSolitaire.\n\n267\n00:16:26.186 --> 00:16:28.940\nIt's probably one of the biggest\ntime-wasters there are, but.\n\n268\n00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.350\n>> I love that game, I love that.\n\n269\n00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:32.520\n>> It's pretty awesome.\n\n270\n00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.350\n>> I got hooked on Minesweeper for\na while.\n\n271\n00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:35.172\n>> Yeah, okay.\n\n272\n00:16:35.172 --> 00:16:38.001\n[CROSSTALK] And\nI know people also have Minesweeper,\n\n273\n00:16:38.001 --> 00:16:40.257\nthey have Screensavers that'll pop up.\n\n274\n00:16:40.257 --> 00:16:41.920\n>> So when somebody runs it.\n\n275\n00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.670\nThere's a spreadsheet up there,\nyou know what I mean?\n\n276\n00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.380\nSo, but yeah,\nit is important as we joke about it.\n\n277\n00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:54.360\nBut still, if you don't have a policy for\n\n278\n00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:00.990\naccess, a policy for reporting,\nand a policy for computer use.\n\n279\n00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.450\nYou're going to have problems.\n\n280\n00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.950\nAnd then, along with that policy,\nthat policy would also say,\n\n281\n00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:09.340\nwhat are the punishments?\n\n282\n00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.470\nWhat are the restrictions?\n\n283\n00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.900\nWhat happens if you do break that?\n\n284\n00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.440\n>> So there has to be some level.\n\n285\n00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:20.810\n>> There has to be some form\nof consequence if you don't.\n\n286\n00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.220\nBe the third time you're let go.\n\n287\n00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:29.406\nIf that where the way it went,\n\n288\n00:17:29.406 --> 00:17:35.110\nmore people will be less\napt to make those mistakes.\n\n289\n00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.090\n>> So educate our users\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n290\n00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.547\n>> Get them to understand the importance\n\n291\n00:17:39.547 --> 00:17:40.598\nof security, awareness.\n\n292\n00:17:40.598 --> 00:17:41.880\n>> Sure, training.\n\n293\n00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.390\nTrain them in the security protocols.\n\n294\n00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:50.130\nBut I think, without a doubt,\ntraining is such an important part.\n\n295\n00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.600\nI think that everybody, like these little\nvignettes that we've done, I think that\n\n296\n00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.620\nthey really, something like that can\nbe really helpful to people to receive.\n\n297\n00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:00.500\nSo thereâs some great\ntraining programs out there.\n\n298\n00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.462\nI don't know, maybe I could talk\nPeter into actually doing some.\n\n299\n00:18:03.462 --> 00:18:04.278\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n300\n00:18:04.278 --> 00:18:09.414\n>> Because I think for large majority\nof people that approach is good,\n\n301\n00:18:09.414 --> 00:18:13.030\nbecause you can see\nexactly what could happen.\n\n302\n00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:18.110\nIn a short entertaining way, but\nwhat did you call it edutainment.\n\n303\n00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.129\n>> Edutainment that's what we do here,\nthat's what we're do here.\n\n304\n00:18:20.129 --> 00:18:22.090\nAnd that's what we're doing here, right?\n\n305\n00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:26.350\nWe're trying to educate the user,\nthe person that's watching this content.\n\n306\n00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.786\nSo that they are able to say,\nthis is what we need to be watching right?\n\n307\n00:18:29.786 --> 00:18:33.323\nThis is the information that\nshows you how important it is.\n\n308\n00:18:33.323 --> 00:18:39.423\nWe show you using Cobalt Strike\nto access usernames or passwords.\n\n309\n00:18:39.423 --> 00:18:42.213\nAnd using SAT to access Facebook\nusernames or passwords.\n\n310\n00:18:42.213 --> 00:18:44.405\nThat's the kind of thing that\ngets people's attention.\n\n311\n00:18:44.405 --> 00:18:47.425\nAnd now they're, okay,\nwell this is important,\n\n312\n00:18:47.425 --> 00:18:49.682\nit's contextually pertinent to me.\n\n313\n00:18:49.682 --> 00:18:50.657\nSo yeah, we are doing that.\n\n314\n00:18:50.657 --> 00:18:53.480\n>> I will never use Facebook again.\n\n315\n00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.591\n>> That's right, I'm done.\n\n316\n00:18:56.591 --> 00:19:01.006\n>> It might be helpful to actually\nhave unannounced pen tests or\n\n317\n00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:03.436\nunannounced periodic testing.\n\n318\n00:19:03.436 --> 00:19:04.149\n>> Pop quizzes.\n\n319\n00:19:04.149 --> 00:19:06.500\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n320\n00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:11.200\nSo like you said in your company,\nwhere you would send people,\n\n321\n00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.290\nyou would do fishing expeditions\njust to try to catch them.\n\n322\n00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.170\nThat type of stuff is good, and\n\n323\n00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.140\nprobably rather than punishing people\nprobably give them a rewards system.\n\n324\n00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:24.299\nI've always been in favor of positive\nreinforcement versus negative\n\n325\n00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:25.670\nreinforcement.\n\n326\n00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.510\nI mean you are number one on the list.\n\n327\n00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.275\nOkay?\nYou get a prize.\n\n328\n00:19:29.275 --> 00:19:33.701\nMaybe you get, I don't know, a vacation or\n\n329\n00:19:33.701 --> 00:19:38.618\na gift certificate to\na really cool restaurant.\n\n330\n00:19:38.618 --> 00:19:43.612\nSo I think that's more of a way to go and\nthat's the way I always deal with my team.\n\n331\n00:19:43.612 --> 00:19:47.497\nBut either way works\nbecause sometimes positive\n\n332\n00:19:47.497 --> 00:19:50.845\nreinforcements doesn't work, right.\n\n333\n00:19:50.845 --> 00:19:52.291\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> There's pros and cons to each side.\n\n334\n00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:54.620\n>> Yeah, you need to be something.\n\n335\n00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.910\nSo, and you need to constantly review.\n\n336\n00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.520\nYou can't just say,\nI'm gonna put a policy in place and\n\n337\n00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.940\nthen that's it, never change it.\n\n338\n00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.670\nYou gotta keep going through the cycle.\n\n339\n00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:06.500\nOkay?\n\n340\n00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:12.410\nYou're testing, evaluating, improving,\n\n341\n00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:17.960\nretesting, and constantly through that\ncycle, so that it is a dynamic process.\n\n342\n00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:25.878\nMaybe something like use a waste\nmanagement company that has\n\n343\n00:20:25.878 --> 00:20:30.540\nlocked containers.\n\n344\n00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:35.310\nAnd try to get people hip to, yeah,\nwell this has worked in a number of ways.\n\n345\n00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:39.970\nIf people have gotten past\nthe locked containers simply by\n\n346\n00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:43.590\nsocially engineering their way to them.\n\n347\n00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:51.070\nIt'd be really helpful to\ntry to control that area.\n\n348\n00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:54.450\nDispose of thumb-drives in the proper way.\n\n349\n00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.990\nActually, pretty crazy story\nwith thumb-drives was they\n\n350\n00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.810\ndid an experiment where they just dropped\na bunch of thumb-drives in a parking lot.\n\n351\n00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.410\nYou've heard of that, right?\n\n352\n00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:07.780\n>> That's how Stuxnet got into the Iranian\n>> I don't think so.\n\n353\n00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.525\n>> That's what I've heard.\n\n354\n00:21:08.525 --> 00:21:12.285\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> But certainly.\n\n355\n00:21:12.285 --> 00:21:13.318\n>> Somebody walked it in there.\n\n356\n00:21:13.318 --> 00:21:15.668\n>> Somebody walked it in there, yeah.\n\n357\n00:21:15.668 --> 00:21:17.290\nOkay, somebody walked it in there.\n\n358\n00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.480\nBut there you go,\nthere's one of the coolest,\n\n359\n00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:26.280\none of the greatest social\nengineering exploits over time.\n\n360\n00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.450\nA truly weaponized exploit.\n\n361\n00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:36.909\nSo, the other thing is that remember\nwe talked about affect heuristic.\n\n362\n00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:43.700\nOkay, so affect heuristic\nis when you're overwhelmed,\n\n363\n00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:48.275\nyou maybe impacted by all the different\n\n364\n00:21:48.275 --> 00:21:53.690\nfactors of influence and\nyou take a shortcut.\n\n365\n00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.190\nSo, I've talked about\nthe Carl Sagan's Baloney Detector.\n\n366\n00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.340\nThere are things you can do.\n\n367\n00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:09.650\nFor instance, you may have a hypothesis\nbut don't take the first one.\n\n368\n00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.820\nRelate it to somebody else,\nwhat do you think about that?\n\n369\n00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.550\nDo you think that we should require\n\n370\n00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.730\neverybody to have two\nfactor authentication?\n\n371\n00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.500\nDo you see how is that gonna work,\ncompare if to somebody else.\n\n372\n00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:25.700\nSo, try to get teams of people\nworking on kinda critical thinking.\n\n373\n00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.270\nTry to always have maybe two people.\n\n374\n00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.440\nWhen it comes to wire\ntransfers at this point,\n\n375\n00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.090\nbecause the CEO wire\ntransfer exploit has been so\n\n376\n00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:38.050\nsuccessful, now banks are requiring\ntwo people to sign off on it.\n\n377\n00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:42.839\nSo, that makes it a lot more difficult for\nthat type of exploit to be pulled off.\n\n378\n00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.500\nEven encouraged debate when youâre\ngoing to make policy changes.\n\n379\n00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:54.160\nTry to encourage debate amongst\ninvolved in a secured area to\n\n380\n00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.290\nas a team try to come up with a solution\nrather than one personâs approach.\n\n381\n00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:01.540\n>> 10 heads are better than one right?\n\n382\n00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:05.370\n>> Try to spin more\nthan one creative idea.\n\n383\n00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.824\nCome up with a ton of ideas.\n\n384\n00:23:07.824 --> 00:23:12.465\nCome up with many ideas and\nthen try to, what they call use a,\n\n385\n00:23:12.465 --> 00:23:16.026\nwhen you have two competing concepts,\nokay?\n\n386\n00:23:16.026 --> 00:23:18.796\nThere's what's called Occam's razor.\n\n387\n00:23:18.796 --> 00:23:21.520\nOkay?\nAnd so Occam's razor basically says\n\n388\n00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:26.524\njust use the simpler one, easier approach.\n\n389\n00:23:26.524 --> 00:23:29.650\nThat is probably the simplest way to go.\n\n390\n00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:30.680\n>> That path is probably the best.\n\n391\n00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.370\n>> The path of least resistance, right.\n\n392\n00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.235\nQuantify whenever possible.\n\n393\n00:23:35.235 --> 00:23:36.370\nOkay?\n\n394\n00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:39.652\nTry to when you pick up a couple flags.\n\n395\n00:23:39.652 --> 00:23:43.660\nYou think something's funny [INAUDIBLE].\n\n396\n00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.802\nReally think about that stop and\n\n397\n00:23:45.802 --> 00:23:49.778\njust don't make a snap decision\neven if you're in a hurry.\n\n398\n00:23:49.778 --> 00:23:55.296\nNow, a lot of time social engineers\nare going to utilize the scarcity element.\n\n399\n00:23:55.296 --> 00:23:58.778\nNot so much as saying,\nwell this is your last opportunity.\n\n400\n00:23:58.778 --> 00:24:01.895\nThey're gonna show up at five o'clock,\nor 5:05.\n\n401\n00:24:01.895 --> 00:24:06.160\nAnd say, hey, we gotta get in to\nthe server room, I gotta go, and\n\n402\n00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.680\nI say well we were told\nby the boss to be here.\n\n403\n00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.876\nAnd they got the boss's name and\nthey'll put that kind\n\n404\n00:24:14.876 --> 00:24:19.910\nof Intensity on you, so what's the policy?\n\n405\n00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:24.087\nThe policy says no, everybody leaves at\nfive o'clock, there are no exceptions,\n\n406\n00:24:24.087 --> 00:24:26.480\nor it has to be cleared by someone.\n\n407\n00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.970\nAnd so\nthat's another important element to it.\n\n408\n00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:33.760\nSome additional issues,\nconduct control experiments.\n\n409\n00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:44.729\nWhere maybe the person that you're\nactually testing isn't aware of the test.\n\n410\n00:24:44.729 --> 00:24:49.795\nCommon fallacies of logic and rhetoric.\n\n411\n00:24:49.795 --> 00:24:53.775\nThis was yours, at homonym, okay?\n\n412\n00:24:53.775 --> 00:24:55.665\nAttacking the arguer and not the argument.\n\n413\n00:24:56.835 --> 00:24:57.997\n>> That's a very popular technique.\n\n414\n00:24:57.997 --> 00:24:58.665\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and it works,\n\n415\n00:24:58.665 --> 00:24:59.227\nit works,\n>> It does.\n\n416\n00:24:59.227 --> 00:25:03.577\n>> Especially if you get somebody's ire,\nwhy not?\n\n417\n00:25:03.577 --> 00:25:06.537\nYou don't really have\na reasonable logical way.\n\n418\n00:25:06.537 --> 00:25:08.657\nYou kinda could get\nsomebody kinda flared up.\n\n419\n00:25:08.657 --> 00:25:12.142\nBut, again,\nremember my concepts of mental judo.\n\n420\n00:25:12.142 --> 00:25:13.397\nOkay?\nStop.\n\n421\n00:25:14.608 --> 00:25:15.336\nCount to ten.\n\n422\n00:25:15.336 --> 00:25:16.506\nOkay.\n\n423\n00:25:16.506 --> 00:25:18.848\nStep back.\n\n424\n00:25:18.848 --> 00:25:23.058\nAssess the situation then\nmove forward with it.\n\n425\n00:25:23.058 --> 00:25:28.878\nSometimes I guess in\nan emergency something blows up.\n\n426\n00:25:28.878 --> 00:25:30.848\nEven then, stop!\n\n427\n00:25:30.848 --> 00:25:32.278\nDon't go into panic mode.\n\n428\n00:25:32.278 --> 00:25:34.398\nDon't go in a chaotic mode.\n\n429\n00:25:34.398 --> 00:25:35.200\nAssess.\n\n430\n00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.468\nMaybe you don't have to count to ten.\n\n431\n00:25:37.468 --> 00:25:38.020\nBut stop.\n\n432\n00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.010\n>> Ten might be too long.\n\n433\n00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:43.710\n>> Ten might be too long yeah but\ndo back off.\n\n434\n00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:45.930\nGive yourself a little space.\n\n435\n00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.220\nGet a little vision of what's going on.\n\n436\n00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.910\n>> Sometimes just taking\nthat step back and\n\n437\n00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.890\nall right I'm going to take\na breath really quick.\n\n438\n00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:55.490\nI know the world is falling\ndown around me but okay.\n\n439\n00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:56.070\nWhat am I gonna do?\n\n440\n00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.160\n>> Yeah.\n>> You clear your mind.\n\n441\n00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:57.880\nYou clear your head.\n\n442\n00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.980\nYou think rationally.\n\n443\n00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.490\nYou don't make an emotional\nresponse to something, and\n\n444\n00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:03.970\neven when it's not immediate.\n\n445\n00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:05.780\nThey don't have that time pressure,\n\n446\n00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.940\nthat just any kind of emotional\npressure being put on you.\n\n447\n00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.580\nYou have some time to relax.\n\n448\n00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.094\nYou can still get caught up, and you need\nto be like Thomas said, be looking for\n\n449\n00:26:14.094 --> 00:26:17.010\nthe red flags, and\nevery now and then assessing.\n\n450\n00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:18.600\nHas any kind of gut feeling gone off?\n\n451\n00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.300\nHas any kind of something's not right?\n\n452\n00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.690\nYou talked about Carl Sagan's\nbologna test, or\n\n453\n00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:26.170\nmore commonly known as the sniff test,\nright?\n\n454\n00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.129\nSomething smells funny about this.\n\n455\n00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:34.220\nGo with that instinct, cuz even if it\nisn't, there's nothing funny about it,\n\n456\n00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.850\nthere's nothing fishy about it.\n\n457\n00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:36.530\nTrust it.\n\n458\n00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:39.446\n>> Right, what have you done [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah trust your feelings,\n\n459\n00:26:39.446 --> 00:26:41.954\ntrust your gut instinct about it.\n\n460\n00:26:41.954 --> 00:26:42.653\n>> Err on the side of caution.\n\n461\n00:26:42.653 --> 00:26:46.249\n>> Because really what I'm saying is it's\na combination of all the senses, and\n\n462\n00:26:46.249 --> 00:26:47.755\nyou're picking up something.\n\n463\n00:26:47.755 --> 00:26:52.470\nAnd if you stopped and really think\nit through it will make sense to you.\n\n464\n00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:56.658\n>> If a Nigerian prince contacts me about\nsome money transfers, if it's legit,\n\n465\n00:26:56.658 --> 00:26:59.323\nhe's going to continue to\nsay lets work this out,\n\n466\n00:26:59.323 --> 00:27:03.782\nlet's make this happen here [CROSSTALK]\nthey're really gonna do something right?\n\n467\n00:27:03.782 --> 00:27:06.220\nThey're not just gonna be like hey do\nthis now and you can get some money.\n\n468\n00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.338\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I remember my mother said, Tom,\n\n469\n00:27:08.338 --> 00:27:10.400\nthere's no such thing as a free lunch.\n\n470\n00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.280\n>> No such thing.\n\n471\n00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.580\n>> It doesn't exist.\n\n472\n00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:18.600\n>> So with the Carl Sagan stuff and\nthere's a lot of it.\n\n473\n00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.790\nThere's a list of them it's great,\nlook it up.\n\n474\n00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.620\nI find it's really helpful.\n\n475\n00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:29.420\nAnd I think this helps us to\nbalance what we're going to see.\n\n476\n00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.768\nWe've got one more module, I can see we\nare coming to the end of this session.\n\n477\n00:27:32.768 --> 00:27:39.090\nSo we've got one more module, some\nthings to hit so I think we'll save it.\n\n478\n00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:39.812\n>> Keep it for that?\n\n479\n00:27:39.812 --> 00:27:41.600\n>> Yeah, drop it at this point.\n\n480\n00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.860\n>> Sounds like a fantastic idea,\nTom thoroughly enjoying the conversation.\n\n481\n00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.590\nThoroughly, enjoying this topic,\nit's a lot of fun,\n\n482\n00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:49.550\nhopefully you guys\nare enjoying it as well.\n\n483\n00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:52.390\nWell, we have another one of our\ngreat part twos coming up for you.\n\n484\n00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:54.820\nFor this section,\nlooks like we're coming to an end.\n\n485\n00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:58.020\nSo, we do thank you for joining us today,\nwe are going to go ahead and\n\n486\n00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:58.890\nsign off though.\n\n487\n00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:01.890\nFor ITPro TV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowery.\n\n488\n00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:02.630\n>> Tom Octagrove.\n\n489\n00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:07.105\n>>

another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.950\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n5\n00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.610\nin today's episode we continue forth with\nmore of our Social Engineering series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.857\nJoining us back in the studio again for\na little bit more,\n\n7\n00:00:25.857 --> 00:00:30.537\nto add the cherry on top of the proverbial\ncake, is our friend Mr. Tom Updegrove.\n\n8\n00:00:30.537 --> 00:00:32.722\nTom, welcome back, sir,\nso glad to have you.\n\n9\n00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:35.986\nWhat are we going to talk about today?\n\n10\n00:00:35.986 --> 00:00:40.231\n>> Well, we're gonna kinda finish up\nremediation with some more psychological\n\n11\n00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:41.010\nprinciples.\n\n12\n00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.660\nBut this is kinda interesting because we\nwanna take the Cialdini Principles of\n\n13\n00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.940\nInfluence and we're gonna add in\nthe five types of personalities and\n\n14\n00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.890\nmix them together to see\nwhich of these personalities\n\n15\n00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.580\nare more influenceable\nthrough the concept?\n\n16\n00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.360\nSo I'm gonna roll back\nup my chart on influence\n\n17\n00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.820\nand, if you remember,\njust to reiterate, we have authority.\n\n18\n00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.230\nAn authority can be hierarchical or\nit can be experiential.\n\n19\n00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.550\nWe defer to people who know more\nthan us or we think they do.\n\n20\n00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:30.210\nSo, there's commitment and consistency,\nwe see that as an influencible element.\n\n21\n00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.470\nReciprocity, right,\nsomebody gives us a gift,\n\n22\n00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.000\nwe wanna be able to give them a gift back.\n\n23\n00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.200\nIf we don't give them a gift back,\nwe're a cheapskate.\n\n24\n00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.840\nIf we give them a gift and if they\ntry to return a gift, we refuse it,\n\n25\n00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.460\nwe're considered kind of weird.\n\n26\n00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.330\nAnd likeability, likeability's\nprobably the biggest one that we see.\n\n27\n00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.020\nIt's an important one.\n\n28\n00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.420\nI mean really if you want\nto accomplish anything,\n\n29\n00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.020\nyou've got to really come off likeable.\n\n30\n00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.550\nLikeable people are more\napt to be able to achieve\n\n31\n00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.170\nthe success in their endeavors\nthan people who could care less.\n\n32\n00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.750\nScarcity, scarcity is another one.\n\n33\n00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.300\nRemember that the salesman\nis going to say for\n\n34\n00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.860\nthis next half hour, or for\nthis limited time, we're going to get it.\n\n35\n00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.258\nWe only have a few left, so\nyou gotta get it while you can.\n\n36\n00:02:26.258 --> 00:02:29.698\nScarcity works in a lot of different\nways and then there's social proof.\n\n37\n00:02:29.698 --> 00:02:34.119\nSo social proof is one of those things\nthat if everybody else is doing it,\n\n38\n00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:35.140\nit must be okay.\n\n39\n00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.691\nIn fact, somebody was asking last night\nabout WordPress, about how secure it was.\n\n40\n00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:48.081\nI said well, I don't know,\nI know guys that build security tools\n\n41\n00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:54.650\nthat actually use WordPress for their\nblog, to explain their tools and stuff.\n\n42\n00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.900\nAnd I go, if it's good enough for\nthem, it must be good.\n\n43\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.292\nI'm just applying the whole\nprinciple of social proof.\n\n44\n00:03:02.292 --> 00:03:06.090\nSo, they're the elements of influence and\nwe've went through them, so\n\n45\n00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.980\nI'm not gonna really run on too much.\n\n46\n00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.090\nBut I do want you to look at what\nwe call the big five personalities.\n\n47\n00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.750\nAnd so there is conscientiousness.\n\n48\n00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.610\nA conscientious person\nthrives with confidence.\n\n49\n00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.460\nThey move towards confidence,\nself-control.\n\n50\n00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.250\nPersistent, they're\na very persistent breed.\n\n51\n00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.450\nDue diligence, sometimes I guess this is\ncalled a anal-compulsive personality.\n\n52\n00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.200\nHowever, do they follow rules and\nstandards.\n\n53\n00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.170\nTheir values really are achievement and\nthey're efficient, they're orderly.\n\n54\n00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.300\nEverything is in a right place.\n\n55\n00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.160\nThese personalities,\nwhether they're positive or\n\n56\n00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.830\nnegative, these we can look at\na person as being conscientious.\n\n57\n00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.490\nThen we have the extroverted person.\n\n58\n00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.965\nOkay, certainly,\nthe extroverted person, sociability.\n\n59\n00:04:14.965 --> 00:04:18.580\nThey're outgoing, they talk to everybody.\n\n60\n00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.120\nThey can dominate,\nyou probably find the extroverted\n\n61\n00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.180\nperson really with that\nnarcissistic conversation going on,\n\n62\n00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.730\njust talking about them and never giving\nyou an opportunity to even say anything.\n\n63\n00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.640\n>> These are the people that tend to\nbe the center of attention, as it were.\n\n64\n00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.810\n>> Yeah right, have high ambition,\nthey're striving to achieve things,\n\n65\n00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.480\ngo for excitement, love a fast car,\n\n66\n00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.240\nprobably have a fast car,\ncertainly seek a way.\n\n67\n00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.660\nAnd the value is rewards and\nsocial attention.\n\n68\n00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.260\nWhere this is the things\nthat they strive for.\n\n69\n00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.090\nSo something important to consider.\n\n70\n00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.800\nThen we have the open personality,\nas I'm going around my circle.\n\n71\n00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.070\nRight, so the open person values\ncreativity and invention,\n\n72\n00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:19.030\nintellectual stimulation, the ability to\nbe receptive to new ideas and creativity.\n\n73\n00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.840\nUsually the open people\nare probably the type that\n\n74\n00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.930\ngets involved in information technology.\n\n75\n00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.800\nBecause they're open to new ideas.\n\n76\n00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.560\nThey're the person who usually has to have\nthe newest device and the latest device.\n\n77\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.889\nAnd they're always on\nthe cutting edge of ideas, okay?\n\n78\n00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:41.120\nAnd the open person moves\na little bit towards fantasy.\n\n79\n00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.260\nThey may be the person that\nlikes to play fantasy games.\n\n80\n00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.280\nAnd they like change,\nthey don't like things to stand still.\n\n81\n00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.450\nI'm gonna move over to the agreeable\nperson before I hit the neurotic, okay?\n\n82\n00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.310\nSo the agreeable person is compassionate,\n\n83\n00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.430\naltruistic, they love everybody,\nthey cooperate.\n\n84\n00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.760\nThey're trustful, they're honest.\n\n85\n00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.210\nThey are very helpful.\n\n86\n00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.000\nAnd they're straightforward.\n\n87\n00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.990\nYou ask them a question and\nthey'll give you an answer.\n\n88\n00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.850\nOkay, did you take that sandwich\nout of the refrigerator?\n\n89\n00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.090\nYes I did, I was hungry.\n\n90\n00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.490\nThey won't lie.\n\n91\n00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.420\nTheir value is they have\ncommunal goals and harmony.\n\n92\n00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.920\nI mean, this person is always got,\nthey're the kind of person that's gonna\n\n93\n00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.060\nbe on a team, gonna be working,\nkinda always going along with things.\n\n94\n00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.230\n>> This is the kind of person who always,\nI tend to see as, they avoid conflict.\n\n95\n00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.080\nOr if there is conflict,\nthey wanna resolve it as soon as possible.\n\n96\n00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.534\n>> Yeah, so that person is gonna actually\nprobably move away from conflict.\n\n97\n00:06:51.534 --> 00:06:54.860\n>> Right.\n>> Doesn't like conflict.\n\n98\n00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.470\nThen there is the neurotic person, okay?\n\n99\n00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.850\nThe neurotic person,\n\n100\n00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.840\nit's gonna be interesting to see what\nthe finding is with the neurotic person.\n\n101\n00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.300\nBut so they tend to brood.\n\n102\n00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:12.060\nThey tend to have a negative emotions,\nor pessimistic about things,\n\n103\n00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.950\nor usually complaining\nthat their coffee's cold.\n\n104\n00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:23.046\nThey have a lot of anxiety and\ncertainly they're pessimistic.\n\n105\n00:07:23.046 --> 00:07:26.496\n[CROSSTALK] The stereotype,\n\n106\n00:07:26.496 --> 00:07:33.118\nthey see the glass as half\nempty rather than half full.\n\n107\n00:07:33.118 --> 00:07:40.290\nBut so they tend to be non-threatening,\nbut yet consistent.\n\n108\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:48.770\nThe interesting about those is that they\ngo back to the conscientious person.\n\n109\n00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.590\nThat conscientious person obeys rules.\n\n110\n00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:57.760\nIf there aren't any rules,\nthey still, they're compliant.\n\n111\n00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:03.820\nThey're coping mechanism is in fact, the\nway to cope with them is through training,\n\n112\n00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.970\nsupport, to reduce their fear of things.\n\n113\n00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.010\nBut, their attack vector, and\nthis is where I'm getting at this,\n\n114\n00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:19.640\ntheir attack vector is they're prone\nto password reset to exploit them.\n\n115\n00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.750\nIt's possible to get them to really\n\n116\n00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.720\nyield that because they're\ngonna comply with your request.\n\n117\n00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.410\nThe extroverted person needs\nliking as social proof.\n\n118\n00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:34.710\nAll right.\nSo\n\n119\n00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.320\ntheir attack vector is\nthrough social events.\n\n120\n00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.050\nElicitation.\n\n121\n00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.598\nThey wanna fit,\nthey wanna fit into a group.\n\n122\n00:08:41.598 --> 00:08:46.144\nSo you can kinda extract information\nfrom them simply by that,\n\n123\n00:08:46.144 --> 00:08:49.710\nby allowing them to become\na member of the group.\n\n124\n00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:55.890\nSo usually initiations, some type of\nacceptance that they're striving to get.\n\n125\n00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.370\nYou may be able to get something for that.\n\n126\n00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.350\n>> So because they need that attaboy,\nthey're prone to those types of attacks.\n\n127\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:07.380\n>> So that person's easily pumped up,\neasily placated.\n\n128\n00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:15.900\nAnd you certainly could use that\ninfluence factor towards that person.\n\n129\n00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.820\nThey are rewards based.\n\n130\n00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.610\nSo here's a person that probably\nwould do well with training.\n\n131\n00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.050\nWith charted progress, okay.\n\n132\n00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.760\nAnd positive reinforcement.\n\n133\n00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.160\nHey, you complete all this training,\nyou'll get a star.\n\n134\n00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.988\nOr Starbucks card.\n\n135\n00:09:34.988 --> 00:09:38.251\n>> You're the fastest, so you get\na dinner at Red Lobster or whatever.\n\n136\n00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:39.255\n>> You get a hat.\n\n137\n00:09:39.255 --> 00:09:41.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But something,\n\n138\n00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.490\nthis person loves certificates,\nawards, badges.\n\n139\n00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.250\nThey probably got a lot of\nstars when they were in school.\n\n140\n00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:55.700\nWhereas the agreeable person,\nthey're after the goodness of mankind.\n\n141\n00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.815\nLike we say, they want everything to be\n\n142\n00:09:59.815 --> 00:10:04.530\nhappy.\n\n143\n00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:11.110\nThey're, you attack them through\nsmall gifts and favors to gain trust.\n\n144\n00:10:13.347 --> 00:10:17.240\nThey'll reciprocate in that fashion.\n\n145\n00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.790\nThe way to cope with them is awareness\ntraining focusing on personal stories.\n\n146\n00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:29.120\nSo this particular group would do\nreally well with our training modules.\n\n147\n00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.290\nOur animations.\n\n148\n00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.070\nThey should really hit\nthat person really well.\n\n149\n00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.610\nAnd maybe that type of training is\nnot the same for everybody else.\n\n150\n00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:43.420\nThe open person depends\non tangible experience.\n\n151\n00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.409\nThey're susceptible yet knowledgeable.\n\n152\n00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.170\nScarcity may lure them\ninto an open target.\n\n153\n00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:57.550\nScarcity is the way to\nkinda get to them because,\n\n154\n00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:02.090\nhey, this opportunity's gonna go away\nreally quick in that if you don't\n\n155\n00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.230\nreally jump on this at this time,\nhey, it's gone.\n\n156\n00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.858\nYou'll never have that opportunity again,\nokay.\n\n157\n00:11:08.858 --> 00:11:16.068\nWell, so they're coping\nreally is elearning systems.\n\n158\n00:11:16.068 --> 00:11:17.859\nEdutainment.\n\n159\n00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:24.320\nOkay, gamification, okay, they really\nseem to do well in these areas.\n\n160\n00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.240\n>> Get those badges, right?\n\n161\n00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.000\n>> Right, then the neurotic person.\n\n162\n00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.790\nWe found that the neurotic person,\ndistrusting everything, being aloof,\n\n163\n00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:40.950\nbeing a standoff, an outlier, is the\nhardest person to socially engineer, okay?\n\n164\n00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:46.170\nSo when you see that person\nas one of your targets then,\n\n165\n00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.980\nmaybe, that's a person to eliminate.\n\n166\n00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.380\nHead towards somebody that's a little\nmore agreeable, a little more open, okay.\n\n167\n00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.290\nI can't say that this exhausts\nthe entire system of personality, but\n\n168\n00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.690\nI do want you to kinda\nlook at the chart here.\n\n169\n00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:05.390\nThis, here, the principles of\ninfluence used by social engineers\n\n170\n00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:10.280\nare what's called the social\nengineering personality framework.\n\n171\n00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.030\nOkay, it's kind of interesting.\n\n172\n00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:17.510\nI won't, as I say I won't say it's the end\nall, but you can see that the principles\n\n173\n00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:22.300\nof influence at one side, which types\nof personalities that they can work.\n\n174\n00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.490\nI know people that work with\nnine types of personalities.\n\n175\n00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:31.874\nTypical matrix in psychotherapy\nis eight types of personalities.\n\n176\n00:12:31.874 --> 00:12:35.355\nYou have assertive to introverted.\n\n177\n00:12:35.355 --> 00:12:40.290\nBut this kinda works.\n\n178\n00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:44.476\nI mean, certainly there's\nbeen a lot of research, and\n\n179\n00:12:44.476 --> 00:12:49.554\nI think to further your awareness\nof how social engineering works,\n\n180\n00:12:49.554 --> 00:12:56.150\nit's important for you to dig into the\nresearch, try to understand more about it.\n\n181\n00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.570\nRead more about it,\nsee what the experiment, and\n\n182\n00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.950\nthere's a lot going on at this point.\n\n183\n00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:07.730\nBecause we're all so aware of how\nimpactful social engineering is.\n\n184\n00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:10.400\n>> So, Tom,\nthis would a fantastic matrix for\n\n185\n00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.480\nus to get really familiar with because the\nmore familiar we are with understanding\n\n186\n00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.590\nwhat personality type is going to\nelicit the type of information or\n\n187\n00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.410\nresponse that we need so\nthat we could either gain access,\n\n188\n00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:27.350\nor the inverse of that, the opposite\nof it, is gonna help us go throughout,\n\n189\n00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:32.830\nespecially if we are going to do something\nlike a pen test via social engineering.\n\n190\n00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.120\nOkay, I've got these people,\nI need to get past them.\n\n191\n00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.350\nThis one is the open person,\nthis one's the neurotic person, and\n\n192\n00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.120\nthis one's the extrovert.\n\n193\n00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.690\nWho's gonna be my most likely target\nbased off of my personality type?\n\n194\n00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.768\nAnd I can use this matrix to\nkinda pinpoint that down, so\n\n195\n00:13:46.768 --> 00:13:48.170\nfamiliarity is good with this.\n\n196\n00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:52.000\n>> An interesting way to deal with this,\nDaniel, would actually be to,\n\n197\n00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.470\njust in your day-to-day movements, within\nyour family, with the people you meet.\n\n198\n00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:01.720\nEven strangers you meet on the street or\ngoing into stores.\n\n199\n00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:09.020\nStart to identify what kind of person that\nis and how they fit into this matrix.\n\n200\n00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.770\nAnd that how would you?\n\n201\n00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.915\nDream up some scenarios, be creative, and\n\n202\n00:14:15.915 --> 00:14:21.855\nthat's the best way to start\npracticing developing your own set\n\n203\n00:14:21.855 --> 00:14:27.205\nof principles to apply when you\nactually go into the field,\n\n204\n00:14:27.205 --> 00:14:30.632\nwhen you do a social\nengineering pen tests.\n\n205\n00:14:30.632 --> 00:14:31.142\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n206\n00:14:31.142 --> 00:14:31.762\n>> Yeah.\n\n207\n00:14:31.762 --> 00:14:33.692\n>> Well, Tom, is there anything else\nwe need to know about this matrix?\n\n208\n00:14:33.692 --> 00:14:35.672\n>> No,\nI think that pretty well takes us through,\n\n209\n00:14:35.672 --> 00:14:41.362\nI think the matrix is,\nin itself, explains itself.\n\n210\n00:14:41.362 --> 00:14:47.592\nAnd, I just wanna thank you for\nthe opportunity to come in here, and\n\n211\n00:14:47.592 --> 00:14:54.480\nto express to you the information and\nresearch that I've done on this.\n\n212\n00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.720\nTell you about my personal experiences and\nthe same with everybody out there.\n\n213\n00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.680\nOkay,

00:15:06.745\nThis has been a very interesting topic.\n\n217\n00:15:06.745 --> 00:15:09.810\nIt's made my mind go crazy, right?\n\n218\n00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.080\nJust have a lot of things,\ncool stuff to think about.\n\n219\n00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.270\nAnd when it comes to IT security and\nit's really,\n\n220\n00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.740\nat the end of the day,\nthat's what we're talking about.\n\n221\n00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.470\nIt's just so\nmuch more expansive than that,\n\n222\n00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.880\nand we can use this in\nevery area of our lives.\n\n223\n00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.160\nWe appreciate you coming in.\n\n224\n00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.730\nAnd explaining these things to us,\nwe really do.\n\n225\n00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:28.320\n>> Thank

you guys have gotten as much out\n\n228\n00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:39.820\nof this as we have, and have thoroughly\nenjoyed it as much as we have as well.\n\n229\n00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.240\nThat being said,\nour final sign off for ITProTV.\n\n230\n00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.169\nI have been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n231\n00:15:45.169 --> 00:15:46.539\n>> And Tom
