  "description": "In this series, Daniel and Tom take you through the \"DNA\" of Social Engineering. They will look into the history of Social Engineering to see where it began and how it has evolved. They will also discuss the tactics, concepts, and tools used by Social Engineers to elicit information from their targets. They also dive into the psychological component of both the attackers as well as the targets and point to documented examples for illustrative purposes.",
